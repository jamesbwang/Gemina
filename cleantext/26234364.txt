  Nature has evolved with a recurring strategy to achieve unusual mechanical properties through coupling variable elastic moduli from a few GPa to below KPa within a single tissue. The ability to produce multi-material , three-dimensional ( 3D) micro-architectures with high fidelity incorporating dissimilar components has been a major challenge in man-made materials. Here we show multi-modulus metamaterials whose architectural element is comprised of encoded elasticity ranging from rigid to soft. We found that , in contrast to ordinary architected materials whose negative Poisson 's ratio is dictated by their geometry , these type of metamaterials are capable of displaying Poisson 's ratios from extreme negative to zero , independent of their 3D micro-architecture. The resulting low density metamaterials is capable of achieving functionally graded , distributed strain amplification capabilities within the metamaterial with uniform micro-architectures. Simultaneous tuning of Poisson 's ratio and moduli within the 3D multi-materials could open up a broad array of material by design applications ranging from flexible armor , artificial muscles , to actuators and bio-mimetic materials.
