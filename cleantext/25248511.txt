  Human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) infection is associated with an increased risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) independent of cigarette smoke exposure. Previous studies have demonstrated that decreased peripheral leukocyte telomere length is associated with HIV<pathogen> , suggesting an accelerated aging phenomenon. We demonstrate that this process of telomere shortening also occurs in the lungs , with significant decreases in telomere length observed in small airway epithelial cells collected during bronchoscopy. Molecular evidence of accelerated aging in the small airway epithelium of persons living with HIV<pathogen> may be one clue into the predisposition for chronic lung disease observed in this population.
