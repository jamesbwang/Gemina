  TAR DNA-binding protein ( TDP-43) pathology in the motor neurons is the most reliable pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) , and motor neurons bearing TDP-43 pathology invariably exhibit failure in RNA editing at the GluA2 glutamine/arginine ( Q/R) site due to down-regulation of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 ( ADAR2). Conditional ADAR2 knockout ( AR2) mice display ALS-like phenotype , including progressive<symptom> motor<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> due to loss of motor neurons. Motor neurons devoid of ADAR2 express Q/R site-unedited GluA2 , and AMPA receptors with unedited GluA2 in their subunit assembly are abnormally permeable to Ca
