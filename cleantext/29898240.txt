  Enzymatic core components from trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthases ( trans-AT PKSs) catalyze exceptionally diverse biosynthetic transformations to generate structurally complex bioactive compounds. Here we focus on a group of oxygenases identified in various trans-AT PKS pathways , including those for pederin , oocydins , and toblerols. Using the oocydin pathway homologue ( OocK) from Serratia<pathogen> plymuthica<pathogen> 4Rx13 and N-acetylcysteamine ( SNAC) thioesters as test surrogates for acyl carrier protein ( ACP)- tethered intermediates , we show that the enzyme inserts oxygen into Î²-ketoacyl moieties to yield malonyl ester SNAC products. Based on these data and the identification of a non-hydrolyzed oocydin congener with retained ester moiety , we propose a unified biosynthetic pathway of oocydins , haterumalides , and biselides. By providing access to internal ester , carboxylate pseudostarter , and terminal hydroxyl functions , oxygen insertion into polyketide backbones greatly expands the biosynthetic scope of PKSs.
