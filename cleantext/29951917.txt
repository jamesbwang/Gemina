  Patients with neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders often express limbic circuit abnormalities and deficits in information processing. While these disorders appear to have diverse etiologies , their common features suggest neurodevelopmental origins. Neurodevelopment is a prolonged process of diverse events including neurogenesis/apoptosis , axon pathfinding , synaptogenesis , and pruning , to name a few. The precise timing of the neurodevelopmental insult to these processes likely determines the resulting functional outcome. We used the epilepsy and schizophrenia-related gestational day 17 methylazoxymethanol acetate model to examine the impact of this timed neurodevelopmental insult on principal cell morphology and synaptic network function of the dorsal hippocampus ( dHPC) circuit. Our observed structural and functional alterations in dHPC are compartment specific , indicating that adverse global exposure during gestation can produce specific alterations and distort information processing in neural circuits that underlie cognitive abilities.
