  The oxygenic photosynthetic bacterium<pathogen> Synechocystis sp.. PCC 6803 ( S6803) is a model cyanobacterium widely used for fundamental research and biotechnology applications. Due to its polyploidy , existing methods for genome engineering of S6803 require multiple rounds of selection to modify all genome copies , which is time-consuming and inefficient. In this study , we engineered the Cas9 tool for one-step , segregation-free genome engineering. We further used our Cas9 tool to delete three of seven S6803 native plasmids. Our results show that all three small-size native plasmids , but not the large-size native plasmids , can be deleted with this tool. To further facilitate heterologous gene expression in S6803 , a shuttle vector based on the native plasmid pCC5 .2 was created. The shuttle vector can be introduced into Cas9-containing S6803 in one step without requiring segregation and can be stably maintained without antibiotic pressure for at least 30 days. Moreover , genes encoded on the shuttle vector remain functional after 30 days of continuous cultivation without selective pressure. Thus , this study provides a set of new tools for rapid modification of the S6803 genome and for stable expression of heterologous genes , potentially facilitating both fundamental research and biotechnology applications using S6803.
