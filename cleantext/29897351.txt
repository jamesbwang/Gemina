  The aim of the present study was to consider the long-term midfacial mucosal outcome around final prosthetic restorations on dental implants placed and loaded immediately after tooth extractions. A total of 42 patients requiring tooth extractions were recruited , and 142 teeth were extracted. Based on the amount of keratinized mucosa ( KM) , implants were categorized into group A ( KM ≥ 2 mm; n = 61) or group B ( KM < 2 mm; n = 62). In both groups , all patients received temporary prosthetic restorations immediately after the surgical procedure. Baseline levels were measured at placement of the final prosthetic restoration and patients were followed for 8 years. After the 8-year follow-up , a survival rate of 98.37 % was reported. Two implants were lost due to peri-implantitis after 6 and 7 years of function , respectively. Peri-implantitis occurred at 9 implants ( 3 from group A and 6 from group B) in 8 patients ( 7.32 %). At the 8-year follow-up for group A , an increase in midfacial tissue level of 0.14 ± 0.13 mm ( screwed restorations) and 0.16 ± 0.09 mm ( cemented restorations) was measured. For group B , a decrease in midfacial tissue level of 0.15 ± 0.09 mm ( screwed restorations) and 0.17 ± 0.12 mm ( cemented restorations) was reported. Statistically significant differences between groups were measured at 2 , 5 , and 8 years of follow-up ( P < .01). The results demonstrated that the presence of KM is significantly associated with less mucosal inflammation<symptom> and less gingival recession , regardless of the type of prosthetic restoration ( screwed vs cemented).
