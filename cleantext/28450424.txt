  Cotton plant architecture , including fruit branch formation and flowering pattern , influences plant light exploitation , cotton yield and planting cost. DNA methylation has been widely observed at different developmental stages in both plants and animals and is associated with regulation of gene expression , chromatin remodelling , genome protection and other functions. Here , we investigated the global epigenetic reprogramming during the development of fruiting branches and floral buds at three developmental stages: the seedling stage , the pre-squaring stage and the squaring stage. We first identified 22 cotton genes which potentially encode DNA methyltransferases and demethylases. Among them , the homologous genes of
