  We aimed to identify foundational non-clinical attributes expected of medical school graduates to be successful in residency. We conducted a three-round modified Delphi study with snowball sampling of experienced medical educators. In Round 1 , respondents rated 28 attributes identified from a literature search. Additional attributes were proposed through invited comments. In Round 2 , respondents expressed their agreement with advanced attribute definitions and examples. Consensus on final definitions and examples was obtained in Round 3. Sixty-four percent ( 105/163) of invited educators participated in Round 1. There was broad representation of educational focus ( undergraduate , graduate , and continuing medical education) and field of practice ( primary care , sub-specialty , medical , and surgical). Thirteen attributes were advanced to Round 2. Ninety-seven of 105 ( 92 %) respondents participated in Round 2 , with greater than 92 % agreement for all attributes. Three pairs were consolidated. In Round 3 , 88 % ( 85/97) of educators expressed greater than 92 % agreement about definitions and representative examples. The final 10 foundational attributes are: communication skills , critical thinking , emotional intelligence , ethical behavior , intellectual curiosity , organizational skills , resilience , self-improvement , teamwork , and vocational commitment. Through a consensus-building process of medical educators , we identified and defined 10 foundational non-clinical attributes for a medical student 's successful transition to residency.
