  To evaluate relationships between an objective biomarker of current tobacco exposure and high-risk genital human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) prevalence among adult women in the United States. We performed a retrospective analysis of adult women ( aged 18-59 years) using three consecutive 2-year cycles ( 2009-2014) from the cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Women who provided self-collected cervicovaginal swabs and serum were included. Human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> genotyping was conducted on cervicovaginal samples with a Linear Array HPV<pathogen> assay. Cotinine , a major metabolite of nicotine , was assayed from serum to provide a biomarker of recent tobacco exposure. Participants were stratified into three levels of tobacco exposure ( nonsmokers , secondhand smoke exposure , and smokers) based on serum cotinine concentration levels using previously published ethnic-specific cut points. Weighted percentages are provided to account for unequal selection probabilities among participants and adjustments for nonresponse. Among the 5,158 women analyzed , 2,778 were classified as nonsmokers ( 57.1 % , 95 % CI 54.5-59.6 %) , 1,109 classified as having secondhand smoke exposure ( 18.4 % , 95 % CI 16.5-20.3 %) , and 1,271 classified as smokers ( 24.6 % , 95 % CI 22.8-26.5 %) using serum cotinine concentration levels. Prevalence of HPV<pathogen> infection differed between nicotine exposure groups ( P < .001): 441 smokers ( 32.1 % , 95 % CI 29.6-34.7 %) , 322 women with secondhand smoke exposure ( 26.1 % , 95 % CI 22.7-29.7 %) , and 451 nonsmokers ( 15.1 % , 95 % CI 13.3-17.1 %) had a high-risk genital HPV<pathogen> infection. Controlling for demographics and number of lifetime sexual partners , the risks compared with nonsmokers for infection with a high-risk HPV<pathogen> genotype for smokers ( adjusted odds ratio ( OR) 1.7 , 95 % CI 1.4-22) and secondhand smokers ( adjusted OR 1.4 , 95 % CI 1.1-1.8) are similarly increased ( P < .001). In this large cross-sectional , population-based study , we show a relationship between an objective biomarker of current tobacco use and genital HPV<pathogen> infection. Cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke are associated with increased odds of infection with high-risk genital HPV<pathogen> independent of lifetime number of sexual partners.
