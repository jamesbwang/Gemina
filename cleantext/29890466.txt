  Esophageal cancer is one of the most common digestive malignant diseases worldwide and emerging evidences revealed that microRNAs ( miRNAs) were implicated in the development and progression of esophageal cancer. However , the expression level and biological function of microRNA-873 ( miR-873) in esophageal cancer are still largely elusive. In this study , we investigated the expression and biological roles of miR-873 in human esophageal cancer. Our results revealed that miR-873 was significantly underexpressed in esophageal cancer tissues and cell lines when compared with the para-tumor tissue and primary human esophageal epithelial cells. Furthermore , overexpression of miR-873 could remarkably inhibit esophageal cancer cell growth , migration and invasion. Moreover , we validated differentiated embryonic chondrocyte expressed gene 2 ( DEC2) as a direct target of miR-873 which could reverse the repressive effects of miR-873 on esophageal cancer cell. In summary , our investigation demonstrated that miR-873 was underexpressed in esophageal cancer and might act as a tumor suppressor gene by directly targeting DEC2.
