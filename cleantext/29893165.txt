  Over the last few decades , medical-assisted robots have been considered by many researchers , within the research domain of robotics. In this article , a 5-degrees-of-freedom spatial medical manipulator is analyzed for path planning , based on inverse kinematic solutions. Analytical methods have generally employed for finding the inverse kinematic solutions in earlier studies. However , this method is only appreciable in case of closed-form solutions. The unusual joint configurations of considered manipulator result in more complexity to attain the closed-form solutions , analytically. To overcome with shortcomings of analytical method , a non-traditional approach named adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is proposed under the class of artificial intelligent techniques. This article presents this neuro-fuzzy approach for desired path generation by 5-degrees-of-freedom manipulator. The estimation of percentage error between actual path and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-generated path is done with respect to x , y , and z directions , respectively. Furthermore , the error between actual and predicted values regarding joint parameters is calculated for a certain arm matrix. The prototype of 5-degrees-of-freedom medical-assisted manipulator is developed at CSIR-CSIO Laboratory Chandigarh , which is also termed as patient-side manipulator to be utilized in robot-assisted surgery. Through the simulation runs , in this work , it is found that the results from adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system approach are quite satisfactory and acceptable.
