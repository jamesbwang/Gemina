  Numerous regulatory genes participate in plant thermotolerance. In Arabidopsis , HEAT-INDUCED TAS1 TARGET2 ( HTT2) is an important thermotolerance gene that is silenced by ta-siR255 , a trans-acting siRNA. ta-siR255 is absent from heading Chinese cabbage ( Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis). Our previous attempt to overexpress the endogenous BrpHTT2 gene of heading Chinese cabbage ( B. rapa ssp. pekinensis) failed because of cosuppression. In theory , heading Chinese cabbage can overexpress Arabidopsis HTT2 to improve thermotolerance in the absence of ta-siR255-mediated gene silencing and the weak potential of coexpression. To test the potential application of HTT2 in improving crop thermotolerance , we transferred p35S:: HTT2 to heading Chinese cabbage. We tested the leaf electrical conductivity , hypocotyl elongation , and survival percentage of p35S:: HTT2 plants subjected to high-temperature ( 38 °C) and heat-shock ( 46 °C) treatment. The leaf electrical conductivity of p35S:: HTT2 seedlings under high temperature decreased but did negligibly change under heat shock<symptom>. The hypocotyl length of p35S:: HTT2 seedlings increased under high temperature and heat shock<symptom>. The survival rate of p35S:: HTT2 seedlings increased under heat shock<symptom>. BrpHsfs , a subset of heat-shock factor genes , were upregulated in p35S:: HTT2 plants under high-temperature and heat shock<symptom> conditions. In the field , transgenic plants with HTT2 appeared greener and formed leafy heads earlier than wild-type plants. Exogenous HTT2 increased the survival rates of heat-shocked heading Chinese cabbage by promoting thermotolerance through decreasing electrical conductivity and extending hypocotyl length. Our work provides a new approach to the genetic manipulation of thermotolerance in crops through the introduction of exogenous thermotolerance genes.
