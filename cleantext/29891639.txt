  To investigate the association between ambulatory medication reconciliation and health care utilization in patients with diabetes. In this retrospective cohort analysis , we studied adults taking at least one diabetes medication treated in primary care practices affiliated with two academic medical centers between 2000 and 2014. We assessed the relationship between the fraction of outpatient diabetes medications reconciled over a 6-month period and the composite primary outcome of combined frequency of emergency department ( ED) visits and hospitalizations over the subsequent 6 months. Among 261,765 reconciliation assessment periods contributed by 31,689 patients , 176,274 ( 67.3 %) , 27,775 ( 10.6 %) , and 57,716 ( 22.1 %) had all , some , or none of the diabetes medications reconciled , respectively. Patients with all , some , or no diabetes medications reconciled had 0.354 , 0.377 , and 0.384 primary outcome events per 6 months , respectively ( A higher fraction of reconciled outpatient diabetes medications was associated with a lower frequency of ED visits and hospitalizations. Individual performance feedback could help to achieve more comprehensive medication reconciliation.
