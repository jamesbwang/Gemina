  It is well known that obesity can lead to increased oxidative stress , which is one of the proposed mechanisms in the etiopathogenesis of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy ( TCM). However , it is unknown if the presence of obesity affects the outcomes in patients with TCM. We queried the National Inpatient Sample database from 2010-2014 to identify adult patients who admitted with a principal diagnosis of TCM with and without obesity. We compared the categorical and continuous variables by Pearson 's chi-square and Student 's t-test respectively in propensity-score matched cohorts. Study cohort comprised of 612 obese TCM ( weighted N = 3034) and 5696 non-obese TCM ( weighted N = 28,186) patients. In the propensity-matched cohorts , obese TCM patients were more often younger and private-insurance enrollees. Cardiac complications such as acute myocardial infarction ( 9.0 % vs 7.4 %; p = 0.04) , cardiac arrest ( 2.3 % vs 0.4 %; p < 0.001) , cardiogenic shock<symptom> ( 4.3 % vs 3.2 % , p = 0.03) , congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 5.0 % vs 3.8 % , p = 0.02) and use of mechanical hemodynamic support ( Impella ®) ( 0.2 % vs 0.0 % , p = 0.02) as well as respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 12.9 % vs. 11.0 % , p = 0.021) were significantly higher among obese TCM cohort. However , there were no significant differences in the all-cause mortality ( 1.0 % vs 0.8 %; p = 0.35) , arrhythmia ( 24.5 % vs. 22.7 % , p = 0.123) , length of stay ( LOS) ( 3.7 ± 3.5 vs 3.7 ± 3.6; p = 0.68) , and total hospital charges ( $ 40780.16 vs $ 42575.14; p = 0.08) between the two groups. Using a national US database , we concluded that the obese TCM patients were more susceptible to develop TCM-related cardiac complications without any impact on all-cause in-hospital mortality , LOS , and hospital charges than non-obese TCM patients.
