  Maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy are associated with risk for offspring emotional and behavioral problems , but the mechanisms by which this association occurs are not known. Infant elevated negative affect ( increased crying , irritability<symptom> , fearfulness , etc.) is a key risk factor for future psychopathology , so understanding its determinants has prevention and early intervention potential. An understudied yet promising hypothesis is that maternal mood affects infant mood via maternal prenatal inflammatory mechanisms , but this has not been prospectively examined in humans. Using data from a pilot study of women followed from the second trimester of pregnancy through six months postpartum ( N = 68) our goal was to initiate a prospective study as to whether maternal inflammatory cytokines mediate the association between maternal depressive symptoms and infant offspring negative affect. The study sample was designed to examine a broad range of likely self-regulation and mood-regulation problems in offspring; to that end we over-selected women with a family history or their own history of elevated symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Results supported the hypothesis: maternal pro-inflammatory cytokines during the third trimester ( indexed using a latent variable that included plasma interleukin-6 , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 concentrations as indicators) mediated the effect , such that higher maternal depressive symptoms were associated with higher maternal inflammation<symptom> , and this mediated the effect on maternal report of infant negative affect ( controlling for maternal affect during the infant period). This is the first human study to demonstrate that maternal inflammatory cytokines mediate the association between prenatal depression<symptom> and infant outcomes , and the first to demonstrate a biological mechanism through which depressive symptoms impact infant temperament.
