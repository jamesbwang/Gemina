  Rechargeable battery cells are composed of two electrodes separated by an ion-conducting electrolyte. While the energy density of the cell is mostly determined by the redox potential of the electrodes and amount of charge they can store , the processes at the electrode-electrolyte interface govern the battery 's lifetime and performance. Viable battery cells rely on unimpeded ion transport across this interface , which depends on its composition and structure. These properties are challenging to determine as interfacial phases are thin , disordered , heterogeneous , and can be very reactive. The recent developments and applications of solid state NMR spectroscopy in the study of interfacial phenomena in rechargeable batteries based on lithium and sodium chemistries are reviewed. The different NMR interactions are surveyed and how these are used to shed light on the chemical composition and architecture of interfacial phases as well as directly probe ion transport across them is described. By combining new methods in solid state NMR spectroscopy with other analytical tools , a holistic description of the electrode-electrolyte interface can be obtained. This will enable the design of improved interfaces for developing battery cells with high energy , high power , and longer lifetime.
