  Although inhibitory control ( IC) is associated with children 's positive adjustment , we know relatively little about factors underlying its development. We examined whether baseline and on-task respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( ( RSA<pathogen>); a physiological measure of self-regulation) and private speech ( a behavioral measure of self-regulation) interacted to confer differences on directly observed IC in 52 typically developing 4-year olds. We found that baseline RSA<pathogen> moderated the association between private speech and IC , such that private speech positively predicted IC in children with relatively higher baseline RSA<pathogen> , but was unrelated to IC in children with relatively lower RSA<pathogen>. We also found that children with a concordant physiological-behavioral pattern ( i.e. , high RSA<pathogen> and high private speech; low RSA<pathogen> and low private speech) had higher IC , higher effortful control , and lower negative emotionality than those with a discordant physiological-behavioral pattern ( i.e. , high RSA<pathogen> and low private speech; low RSA<pathogen> and high private speech). Individual differences in physiological and behavioral self-regulation indices may represent distinct regulation pathways that interact to confer differences in IC during the preschool years.
