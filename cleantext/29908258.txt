  Locus coeruleus nucleus ( LC) is a major noradrenergic nucleus in the brain. It receives dense orexinergic projections from lateral hypothalamus. Whilst it is known that orexin A increases firing rate of LC neurons , its effect on spontaneous and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents ( sIPSCs and eIPSCs , respectively) has not been yet identified. In this research , we investigated the effect of orexin A on eIPSCs and sIPSCs in LC neurons. Whole-cell recordings revealed that orexin A suppresses eIPSCs amplitude in which this effect was blocked by an orexin type-1 receptors antagonist ( SB-334867) and cannabinoid type-1 ( CB1) receptors antagonist ( AM251). Moreover , exposure of neurons to BAPTA ( Ca
