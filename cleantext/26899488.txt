  Resistance to chemotherapy substantially hinders successful glioblastoma ( GBM) treatment , contributing to an almost 100 % mortality rate. Resistance to the frontline chemotherapy , temozolomide ( TMZ) , arises from numerous signaling pathways that are deregulated in GBM , including Hedgehog ( Hh) signaling. Here , we investigate suppression of Hh signaling as an adjuvant to TMZ using U87-MG and T98G cell lines as
