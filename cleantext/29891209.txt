  There is currently little information available on the management of patients with psoriasis in the daily clinical practice of dermatologists in Spain. The aim of this study was to survey a group of Spanish dermatologists with particular expertise in the management of psoriasis to determine their opinions on the protocols used in routine clinical practice. A cross-sectional study based on an online survey about the management of psoriasis sent to 75 dermatologists. The survey , which was specifically designed for the study , included 12questions on different aspects of clinical practice in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. The response rate was 96 % ( n = 72). Biologics were the most widely used monotherapy option. In total , 64.3 % of respondents reported that their patients used conventional systemic therapies for 1 to 2 years before switching to a biologic drug and that the main reason for the switch was unstable control of disease activity. Overall , 85.7 % assigned a `` high '' or `` very high '' importance to the use of a Psoriasis Area Severity Index score of < 3 as a treatment goal. The drugs of choice among the respondents were etanercept for pediatric patients ( 78.6 %) , adalimumab and etanercept for patients with psoriatic arthritis<disease> ( 64.3 %) , and ustekinumab in patients frequently away from home ( 78.6 %) and patients with a history of multiple sclerosis , demyelinating diseases ( 64.3 %) , or poor adherence to treatment ( 71.4 %). This study provides a unique overview of the opinions of a representative sample of expert dermatologists on the current use of biologics for the treatment of psoriasis in Spain.
