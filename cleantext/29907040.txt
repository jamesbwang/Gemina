  Widely used continuum solvation models for electronic structure calculations , including popular polarizable continuum models ( PCMs) , usually assume that the continuum environment is isotropic and characterized by a scalar dielectric constant , ε. This assumption is invalid at a liquid/vapor interface or any other anisotropic solvation environment. To address such scenarios , we introduce a more general formalism based on solution of Poisson 's equation for a spatially varying dielectric function , ε ( r). Inspired by nonequilibrium versions of PCMs , we develop a similar formalism within the context of Poisson 's equation that includes the out-of-equilibrium dielectric response that accompanies a sudden change in the electron density of the solute , such as that which occurs in a vertical ionization process. A multigrid solver for Poisson 's equation is developed to accommodate the large spatial grids necessary to discretize the three-dimensional electron density. We apply this methodology to compute vertical ionization energies ( VIEs) of various solutes at the air/water interface and compare them to VIEs computed in bulk water , finding only very small differences between the two environments. VIEs computed using approximately two solvation shells of explicit water molecules are in excellent agreement with experiment for F
