  Mind-body practices enjoy immense public and scientific interest. Yoga and meditation are highly popular. Purportedly , they foster well-being by curtailing self-enhancement bias. However , this `` ego-quieting '' effect contradicts an apparent psychological universal , the self-centrality principle. According to this principle , practicing any skill renders that skill self-central , and self-centrality breeds self-enhancement bias. We examined those opposing predictions in the first tests of mind-body practices ' self-enhancement effects. In Experiment 1 , we followed 93 yoga students over 15 weeks , assessing self-centrality and self-enhancement bias after yoga practice ( yoga condition , n = 246) and without practice ( control condition , n = 231). In Experiment 2 , we followed 162 meditators over 4 weeks ( meditation condition: n = 246; control condition: n = 245). Self-enhancement bias was higher in the yoga ( Experiment 1) and meditation ( Experiment 2) conditions , and those effects were mediated by greater self-centrality. Additionally , greater self-enhancement bias mediated mind-body practices ' well-being benefits. Evidently , neither yoga nor meditation fully quiet the ego; to the contrary , they boost self-enhancement.
