  Molecularly imprinted polymers ( MIPs) are high affinity robust synthetic receptors , which can be optimally synthesized and manufactured more economically than their biological equivalents ( i.e. antibody). In MIPs production , rational design based on molecular modeling is a commonly employed technique. This mostly aids in ( i) virtual screening of functional monomers ( FMs) , ( ii) optimization of monomer-template ratio , and ( iii) selectivity analysis. We present MIRATE , an integrated science gateway for the intelligent design of MIPs. By combining and adapting multiple state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools into automated and innovative pipelines , MIRATE guides the user through the entire process of MIPs ' design. The platform allows the user to fully customize each stage involved in the MIPs ' design , with the main goal to support the synthesis in the wet-laboratory.
