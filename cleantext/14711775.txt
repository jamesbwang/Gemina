  To determine the prevalence of pulmonary complications in primary Sjögren syndrome<disease> ( pSS) , and to identify the risk factors and the prognosis associated with pulmonary involvement in pSS patients.A total of 1341 hospitalized patients ( 853 with pSS and 488 with secondary Sjögren syndrome<disease> ( sSS)) were retrospectively reviewed. Of these , 165 hospitalized patients with pSS-associated interstitial lung disease ( ILD) were analyzed and recruited as a study group. Eighty-four pSS patients without organ damage were included as a control group.One hundred and sixty-five patients ( 19.34 %) from the pSS group and 126 patients ( 25.82 %) from the sSS group presented with lung involvement. Of the 165 pSS patients with lung complications , 151 ( 91.5 %) were women. The mean age was 61.25 ± 9.79 years , and the median disease duration was 84 ( 24-156) months. Non-specific interstitial pneumonia<disease> ( NSIP; 39.1 %) was the predominant pattern on high-resolution computed tomography ( HRCT). The total HRCT score was 9.71 ± 4.77. Impairment in diffusion capacity was the most common ( 74.3 %) and severe complication ( predicted value of TLCO was 57.5 ± 21.2 %). The 5-year survival rate for all patients with pSS-ILD was 88.5 %. Age , disease duration , rheumatoid factor ( RF) , and C-reactive protein ( CRP) were significantly higher than in controls , whereas anti-SSA was less common. Age , RF , and CRP were independent predictors of ILD after adjustment for confounders.Lung involvement is a common and severe complication of Sjögren syndrome<disease>. Age and disease activity are correlated with pulmonary involvement in pSS patients.
