  Objective to find the Calycosin glycoside ( CG) potential anti-inflammatory effect. The anti-inflammatory activity of CG was evaluated by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced RAW 264.7 cells , and the IL-6 , IL-1β , TNF-α and PGE2 level were measured by ELISA; NO levels in the culture media were determined using the Griess reaction. The iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expressions were measured by qRT-PCR and the phosphorylation of IκBα , p65 , ERK , JNK , and p38 was determined by western blotting. The CG could markedly inhibit the productions of NO and PGE
