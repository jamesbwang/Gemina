  Tooth agenesis ( excluding third molars) is a common congenital disorder that affects 2.2-10 % of the general population. A number of different genes have been shown to be associated with cases of tooth agenesis including AXIN2 , IRF6 , FGFR1 , MSX1 , PAX9 , and TGFA. Wingless/integration signaling gene , AXIN2 , is linked to tooth agenesis and also to colorectal cancer ( CRC). To analyze the correlation between tooth agenesis and CRC. The study included 50 individuals , who were divided into two groups. Group A: 25 individuals diagnosed with CRC and Group B: 25 individuals as a control group. The clinical details were recorded using preformed questionnaire , approved by ethical committee. Orthopantomogram was obtained for all the cases and controls. We observed that 16 % of cases and 8 % of controls reported having tooth agenesis and there was no statistical significance of difference between them ( P = 0.384). Among the study group , 4 % reported oligodontia and 12 % cases reported hypodontia. In the control group 8 % reported hypodontia , there was no incidence of oligodontia. Additional finding in the study group was that 24 % cases had fissured tongue which was not seen in the control group. Individuals with tooth agenesis might have an increased risk for CRC. A larger epidemiological study along with genetic mapping and gene sequencing is necessary to rule out the risk and relationship between tooth agenesis and CRC.
