  Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs) are widely prescribed for several cardiovascular indications. This study investigated patterns of ACEI use for various indications. A descriptive , retrospective population-based study was conducted using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Patients starting ACEIs ( 2007-2014) were selected and ACEI indications were retrieved from electronically recorded medical records. Stratified by indication , we distinguished between persistent and nonpersistent ACEI use , considering a 6-month interval between two prescription periods as a maximum for persistent use. Five-year persistence rates for various indications were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared in a log-rank test. Nonpersistent users were subdivided into three groups: ( i) stop; ( ii) restart; and ( iii) switch to an angiotensin II-receptor blocker. Patients who received ACEIs for hypertension who switched to other classes of antihypertensive medications were further investigated. In total , 254002 ACEI initiators were identified with hypertension ( 57.6 %) , myocardial infarction ( MI; 4.2 %) , renal disease ( RD; 3.7 %) , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF; 1.5 %) , combinations of the above ( 17.2 %) or none of the above ( 15.8 %). Five-year persistence rates ranged from 43.2 % ( RD) to 68.2 % ( MI; P < 0.0001). RD and HF patients used ACEIs for the shortest time ( average 23.6 and 25.0 months , respectively). For the nonpersistent group , the percentage of switchers to angiotensin II-receptor blockers ranged from 27.6 % ( RD) to 42.2 % ( MI) and the restarters ranged from 15.0 % ( HF) to 18.1 % ( group without indication). Depending on the indication , there are various rates of ACEI nonpersistence. Patients with RD are most likely to discontinue treatment.
