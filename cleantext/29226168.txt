  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 gain-of-function ( STAT1 GOF) mutations are the most common cause of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis ( CMC). We aim to report the effect of oral ruxolitinib , the Janus kinase ( JAK) family tyrosine kinase inhibitor , on clinical and immune status of a 12-year-old boy with severe CMC due to a novel STAT1 GOF mutation. Clinical features and laboratory data were analyzed , particularly lymphocyte<symptom> subsets , ex vivo IFNγ- and IFNα-induced STAT1 , 3 , 5 phosphorylation dynamics during the course of JAK1/2 inhibition therapy , and Th17-related , STAT1- and STAT3-inducible gene expression before and during the treatment. Sanger sequencing was used to detect the STAT1 mutation. Literature review of ruxolitinib in treatment of CMC is appended. A novel STAT1 GOF mutation ( c. 617T > C; p.L206P) , detected in a child with recalcitrant CMC , was shown to be reversible in vitro with ruxolitinib. Major clinical improvement was achieved after 8 weeks of ruxolitinib treatment , while sustained suppression of IFNγ- and IFNα-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 , STAT3 , and STAT5 , as well as increased STAT3-inducible and Th17-related gene expression , was demonstrated ex vivo. Clinical relapse and spike of all monitored phosphorylated STAT activity was registered shortly after unplanned withdrawal , decreasing again after ruxolitinib reintroduction. No increase of peripheral CD4 JAK1/2 inhibition with ruxolitinib represents a viable option for treatment of refractory CMC , if HSCT is not considered. However , long-term administration is necessary , as the effect is not sustained after treatment discontinuation.
