  Alginate , an anionic heteropolysaccharide extracted from natural brown algae<pathogen> , has useful properties for the food , chemical , medical , and agricultural industries. Degradation of alginate by alginate lyase is a key process to produce unsaturated oligoalginate and unsaturated monosaccharide 4-deoxy-l-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid. Alginate lyases belonging to the polysaccharide lyase family 7 have been found in , and isolated from , organisms thriving in various environments. Furthermore , research on their function and structure has also progressed well. Here , the preparation of native and recombinant PL-7 alginate lyases and the methods for evaluation of enzymatic activity are summarized. Examples of PL-7 alginate lyase applications are also described.
