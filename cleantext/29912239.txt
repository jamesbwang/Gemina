  The presence of an acute coronary syndrome<disease> in patients with anaphylaxis is a challenging diagnostic conundrum for the cardiologist. Both Kounis syndrome<disease> and takotsubo syndrome<disease> must be taken into account. We present here the case of a 46-year-old woman suffering from ventricular fibrillation after adrenaline infusion for an anaphylactic reaction. The case report shows the important role of a clear diagnostic work-up and the role of cardiac magnetic resonance in this clinical scenario to reach the final diagnosis of reverse takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
