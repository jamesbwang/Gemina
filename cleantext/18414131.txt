  This study explored the effects of the EMDR Integrative Group Treatment Protocol ( EMDR-IGTP) on child survivors of the earthquakes that struck Umbria , a region of central Italy , on August 24th and on October 26th 2016. Three hundred and thirty-two children from the town of Norcia and nearby severely disrupted villages received 3 cycles of EMDR-IGTP. The Emotion Thermometers ( ET-5) and the Children 's Revised Impact of Event Scale ( CRIES-13) were administered before ( T0) and about 1 week after the conclusion of the third cycle ( T3) of EMDR-IGTP. At T3 , older children showed a reduction of distress and anger , whereas younger children reported an increase on these domains; moreover , older children reported a greater reduction of anxiety<symptom> than younger ones. A greater reduction of distress , anxiety<symptom> , and need for help was evidenced in females , whereas a greater improvement in depressive symptoms was evidenced in males. The effects of the EMDR-IGTP treatment on post-traumatic symptoms were particularly evident in older children , compared to younger ones , and marginally greater in females than in males; moreover , a greater improvement was found in children who had received a timelier intervention , than in those who received delayed treatment. These results provide further evidence for the utility of EMDR-IGTP in dealing with the extensive need for mental health services in mass disaster contexts. Also , these data highlight the importance of providing EMDR-IGTP in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster , to contribute significantly in restoring adaptive psychological functioning in children , especially in older ones.
