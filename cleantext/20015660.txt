  Although thyroid hormone ( TH) has important effects on lipid metabolism , the relationship between TH and statin responsiveness has never been investigated. We hypothesize that TH plays an important role in statin responsiveness in patients with acute myocardial infarction ( AMI). Consecutive 1091 hospitalized AMI patients in Fuwai hospital ( Beijing , China) were enrolled into this current study. The study population was divided into three groups based on the intensity of statin treatment: low-intensity ( By general linear analysis , a significant linear trend between free triiodothyronine ( FT3) and LDL-C level ( linear coefficient Our study reveals that variation in FT3 levels is related to the cholesterol-lowering responsiveness of statins in AMI patients. These findings suggest that low FT3 may be a factor responsible for lack of LDL-C goal attainment and patients ' poor responsiveness to statin treatment.
