  Subsistence hunting presents a conservation challenge , by which biodiversity preservation must be balanced with safeguarding of human livelihoods. Globally , subsistence hunting threatens primate populations , including Madagascar 's endemic lemurs. We used a classic conservation biology tool , population viability analysis ( PVA) , to assess the sustainability of lemur hunting in Makira Natural Park , Madagascar. We identified trends in seasonal hunting of eleven Makira lemur species from household interview data , estimated local lemur densities for a subset of species in populations adjacent to focal villages , and quantified extinction vulnerability for these populations , based on species-specific demographic parameters and empirically-derived hunting rates. We compared stage-based Lefkovitch with periodic Leslie matrices to evaluate the impact of regional dispersal on persistence trajectories , then explored consequences of perturbations to the timing of peak hunt in relation to the lemur birth pulse , under assumptions of density-dependent reproductive compensation. We demonstrate how dispersal within a metapopulation-often presented as a conservation rescue opportunity-can drive regional extinction when a majority of local populations are overharvested and show how hunting is most detrimental when timed to overlap with births. We conclude that Makira lemurs are over-exploited; if current hunting rates persist , regional extirpations will be likely and may ultimately contribute to broad-scale extinctions. Cessation of anthropogenic lemur harvest is a conservation priority; development programs are needed to guide communities away from wildlife consumption to domestic protein alternatives.
