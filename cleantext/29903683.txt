  The authors sought to assess the relationship between low oxygen delivery ( DO Retrospective analysis of patient charts and prospectively collected blood samples. University-affiliated tertiary care hospital. Adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery on CPB. Serum UCH-L1 levels were drawn at baseline and 6 and 24 hours after CPB cessation. DO Forty-three adults were included ( median age 65 y , interquartile range 59-72). Three patients experienced strokes ( imaged at 2 , 7 , and 8 d postoperatively). Most patients underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting ( 41 % , 18 patients) or isolated aortic valve replacement ( 30 % , 13). Median UCH-L1 levels differed from baseline to 6 and 24 hours after CPB ( 40 , 232 , and 166 pg/mL , respectively; p < 0.001). On multivariable linear regression analysis controlling for baseline and surgical variables , only DO This is the first study to demonstrate an independent association between DO
