  In pectus excavatum ( PE) patients owing to the location of the heart in the chest cavity , the most affected site of compression by the depressed chest wall is the right heart , and surgical repair has shown to provide a significant relief in the RH cavities compression. Our aim was to explore the relationship between the site of right cardiac compression , chest wall indexes ( CT-CWI) and the sternal torsion angle ( STA) based on cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR) and computed tomography ( CT) among PE patients. We included PE patients with no previous surgical correction referred to CMR and chest CT imaging as presurgical evaluations. The following CT-CWI were calculated: Haller Index ( HI) , correction index ( CI) and STA. A CMR compression classification ( CMR-CC) was implemented based on the analysis ( in the horizontal long axis plane at end of diastole) of the right cardiac compression site , caused by the thoracic cage ( sternum/ribs): Type 0 ( T0): absence of cardiac compression; Type 1 ( T1): compression of the lateral wall of the right ventricle ( RV) without involvement of the atrioventricular ( AV) groove; Type 2 ( T2): compression of the RV involving the AV groove. Sixty PE patients underwent CMR and chest CT.. Fifty ( 81 %) patients were male , and the median age was 17.5 ( 14.0; 23.0) years. T0 , T1 and T2 were found in 14 ( 23 %) , 27 ( 45 %) and 19 ( 32 %) patients. There were significant differences between types with regard to the HI ( T0 3.9 ± 1.1 , T1 4.8 ± 2.0 , T2 6.4 ± 3.1 , p < 0.009) and to the CI ( T0 22.1 ± 10.4 % , T1 31.6 ± 16.1 % , T2 46.9 ± 16.3 % p < 0.0001) and STA ( T0 9.1 ± 7.9 ° , T1 12.7 ± 10.3 ° , class T2 23.0 ± 13.6 ° p = 0.001) respectively. In this study , we established a cardiac magnetic resonance compression classification of patients with pectus excavatum comprising a simple discrimination of cardiac compression sites , which were related to chest wall indexes.
