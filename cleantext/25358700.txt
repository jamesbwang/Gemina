  The present study evaluated the protective effects of melatonin in ethanol ( EtOH)- induced senescence and osteoclastic differentiation in human periodontal ligament cells ( HPDLCs) and cementoblasts and the underlying mechanism. EtOH increased senescence activity , levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and the expression of cell cycle regulators ( p53 , p21 and p16) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (
