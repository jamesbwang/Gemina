  Genomic islands ( GIs) are clusters of genes of probable horizontal origin that play a major role in bacterial and archaeal genome evolution and microbial adaptability. They are of high medical and industrial interest , due to their enrichment in virulence factors , some antimicrobial resistance genes and adaptive metabolic pathways. The development of more sensitive but precise prediction tools , using either sequence composition-based methods or comparative genomics , is needed as large-scale analyses of microbial genomes increase. IslandPath-DIMOB , a leading GI prediction tool in the IslandViewer webserver , has now been significantly improved by modifying both the decision algorithm to determine sequence composition biases , and the underlying database of HMM profiles for associated mobility genes. The accuracy of IslandPath-DIMOB and other major software has been assessed using a reference GI dataset predicted by comparative genomics , plus a manually curated dataset from literature review. Compared to the previous version ( v0 .2.0) , this IslandPath-DIMOB v1 .0.0 achieves 11.7 % and 5.3 % increase in recall and precision , respectively. IslandPath-DIMOB has the highest Matthews correlation coefficient among individual prediction methods tested , combining one of the highest recall measures ( 46.9 %) at high precision ( 87.4 %). The only method with higher recall had notably lower precision ( 55.1 %). This new IslandPath-DIMOB v1 .0.0 will facilitate more accurate studies of GIs , including their key roles in microbial adaptability of medical , environmental and industrial interest. IslandPath-DIMOB v1 .0.0 is freely available through the IslandViewer webserver ( ( http://www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/islandviewer/)) and as standalone software ( ( https://github.com/brinkmanlab/islandpath/)) under the GNU-GPLv3.
