  I. II. III. IV. V. VI. VII. References SUMMARY: Nutrient homeostasis is essential for fungal cells and thus tightly adapted to the local demand in a mycelium with hyphal specialization. Based on selected ectomycorrhizal ( ECM) fungal models , we outlined current concepts of nitrogen and phosphate nutrition and their limitations , and included knowledge from Baker 's yeast when major gaps had to be filled. We covered the entire pathway from nutrient mobilization , import and local storage , distribution within the mycelium and export at the plant-fungus interface. Even when nutrient import and assimilation were broad issues for ECM fungi<pathogen> , we focused mainly on nitrate and organic phosphorus uptake , as other nitrogen/phosphorus ( N/P) sources have been covered by recent reviews. Vacuolar N/P storage and mobilization represented another focus point of this review. Vacuoles are integrated into cellular homeostasis and central for an ECM mycelium at two locations: soil-growing hyphae and hyphae of the plant-fungus interface. Vacuoles are also involved in long-distance transport. We further discussed potential mechanisms of bidirectional long-distance nutrient transport ( distances from millimetres to metres). A final focus of the review was N/P export at the plant-fungus interface , where we compared potential efflux mechanisms and pathways , and discussed their prerequisites.
