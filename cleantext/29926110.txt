  Paediatric epidurals can present technical challenges due to wide variations in age and weight among children , ranging from neonates to teenagers. This study evaluated the skin-to-epidural distance in the thoracic and lumbar regions to determine the relationship between age , weight and ethnicity and depth to the epidural space in our Singapore paediatric population. Data from the Acute<symptom> Pain<symptom> Service was prospectively collected over 16 years. Details included patient demographics , level of epidural performed and distance from skin<symptom> to epidural space. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to determine the association of weight , age , ethnicity and gender with the depths to the thoracic and lumbar epidural spaces. A simple linear regression was calculated to predict the depth to both thoracic and lumbar epidural spaces based on body<symptom> weight. Equations were formulated to describe the relationship between weight and depth of epidural space. A total of 616 midline epidurals were studied. Regression analysis was performed for 225 thoracic epidurals and 363 lumbar epidurals. Our study revealed a clear correlation between skin-to-lumbar epidural distance and weight in children. The best correlation was demonstrated between skin-to-lumbar epidural distance and body<symptom> weight ( R ² = 0.729). This relationship was described by the formula: depth ( mm) = ( 0.63 × weight ( kg)) + 9.2. Skin-to-lumbar epidural distance correlated with weight in children. Our results highlighted the clinical significance of differences between Southeast Asian paediatric populations when compared to other populations.
