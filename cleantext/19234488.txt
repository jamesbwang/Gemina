  AT-rich interactive domain 1A ( ARID1A) and AT-rich interactive domain 1B ( ARID1B) are subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin complex. ARID1A is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently mutated ( 46 %) in ovarian clear cell carcinomas ( OCCC). Loss of ARID1B in an ARID1A-deficient background eliminates the intact SWI/SNF complex , indicating that ARID1B is essential for the formation or stabilization of an intact SWI/SNF complex and , thus , the survival of ARID1A-mutant cancer cell lines. In this study , we investigated the clinicopathologic and prognostic relevance of ARID1B in OCCC by immunohistochemical analysis of 53 OCCC patient samples and loss-of-function experiments in OCCC cell lines. We also examined whether ARID1B could be a therapeutic target or prognostic biomarker in OCCC. siRNA-mediated knockdown of ARID1B in an ARID1A-mutant cell line significantly decreased cell growth , whereas concurrent depletion of both ARID1A and ARID1B was required to decrease wild type cell growth. In the immunohistochemical analyses , low ARID1B level was frequent in samples lacking ARID1A and was associated with shorter progression-free survival. This is the first report demonstrating that a low ARID1B level could be a marker of poor prognosis in OCCC. Moreover , the correlation between the loss of ARID1A immunoreactivity and reduced ARID1B levels indicates that ARID1B could be an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy.
