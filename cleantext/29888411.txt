  High aluminum ( Al) tolerance in rice ( Oryza sativa) is controlled by a Cys2His2-type zinc finger transcription factor ART1 ( Al resistance transcription factor 1). There are five close homologs of ART1 in the rice genome , but the role of these homologs is unknown. We functionally characterized one of the ART1 homologs , ART2 , in terms of tissue and spatial expression , subcellular localization , transcriptional activation activity , and phenotypic analysis of the knockout lines. ART2 was localized to the nucleus and showed a transcriptional activation potential in yeast. ART2 was mainly expressed in the roots , but the expression level was much lower than that of ART1. The ART2 expression was rapidly induced by Al in the roots of the wild-type rice , but not in art1 mutant. Knockout of ART2 resulted in increased sensitivity to Al toxicity , but did not alter sensitivity to different pH values. Expression profile analysis by RNA-sequencing showed that ART2 was not involved in activation of genes regulated by ART1; however , four genes seems to be regulated by ART2 , which are implicated in Al tolerance. These results indicate that ART1 and ART2 regulate different pathways leading to Al tolerance , and ATR2 plays a supplementary role in Al tolerance in rice.
