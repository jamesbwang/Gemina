  Retrospective cohort study OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of preoperative neuropathic pain on outcome and postoperative compliance after grip reconstructive surgery in people with tetraplegia. Specialized tetraplegia upper-limb surgery center in Sweden. All patients who underwent grip reconstructive surgery and attended a 6 month follow up during January 2012 and May 2015 were included. Participants were divided into two groups , pain group and no pain group , based on preoperative rating of experienced pain on a visual analog scale. The main outcome measures were grip strength , grasp ability ( Grasp and Release Test) and prioritized activity outcome ( Canadian Occupational Performance Measure) together with compliance to the rehabilitation plan. The study include 37 patients ( 86 % of the cohort). Seventeen patients experienced preoperative pain ( 46 %). There were no differences in outcome between the pain- and the no pain group regarding grip strength ( 5 vs. 4.6 kg) , grip ability or activity performance and satisfaction ( COPM improvement of 3.1 vs. 3.0 for performance and 3.6 for both groups in satisfaction). Both groups experienced improvements in all aspects and there were no differences in the ability to fulfill postoperative treatment. Individuals with tetraplegia and preoperative neuropathic pain in the arm/hand improve after grip reconstructions in a similar way to those without pain. Patients with neuropathic pain therefore should be considered as surgery candidates to the same extent as those without pain.
