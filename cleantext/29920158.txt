  End-of-life care has attracted increased attention in recent years due to increases in both the number and mean age of the world 's population; however , the experiences of LGBT persons during end-of-life care remain understudied. Given the health disparities and barriers to care experienced throughout the life course of LGBT persons , the frequent involvement of legal spouses in end-of-life care , and the recency of marriage equality , it can be surmised that LGBT persons might experience significantly different barriers to their desired end-of-life care compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. This article aims to synthesize what is known about these barriers , particularly in the absence of legal marriage or protective legal documentation. Of two hundred and twelve articles reviewed , twenty-three were included for analysis. Common barriers that emerged were discriminatory laws ( e.g. , prohibitions against same-sex marriage) and policies , lack of decision-making capacity , lack of knowledge regarding patient wishes , lack of visitation rights , challenges from biological next of kin , and discrimination and psychological distress. Recommendations for future research are provided based on gaps that were identified. These include increased research on transgender persons and bisexual persons , and on providers of end-of-life care. In addition , the recommendations take into account that important legislative and policy changes occurred after the period in which the studies reviewed here were published. The impact of those changes can not be reported in this study and should be determined by future studies. This synthesis provides the contextual understanding necessary for research and improvement in this vastly understudied area.
