  Twisted intramolecular charge transfer ( TICT) chromophores exhibit uniquely large second-order optical nonlinearities ( μβ). However , their promise as electro-optic ( E-O) materials is yet untapped , reflecting a strong tendency to aggregate in low-polarity media , leading to a dramatic fall in μβ. Until now , TICT chromophores in deaggregating polar solvents suffered decreased response due to polarity-driven changes in electronic structure. Here we report a new series of benzimidazolium-based TICT chromophores with interaryl torsional angles in the range of 64-77 °. The most twisted , B2TMC-2 , exhibits a large μβ
