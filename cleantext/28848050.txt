  UBE2M and UBE2F are two family members of neddylation E2 conjugating enzyme that , together with E3s , activate CRLs ( Cullin-RING Ligases) by catalyzing cullin neddylation. However , whether and how two E2s cross-talk with each other are largely unknown. Here , we report that UBE2M is a stress-inducible gene subjected to cis-transactivation by HIF-1 and AP1 , and MLN4924 , a small molecule inhibitor of E1 NEDD8-activating enzyme ( NAE) , upregulates UBE2M via blocking degradation of HIF-1Î± and c-JUN. UBE2M is a dual E2 for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation of UBE2F , acting as a neddylation E2 to activate CUL3-Keap1 E3 under physiological conditions but as a ubiquitylation E2 for Parkin-DJ-1 E3 under stressed conditions. UBE2M-induced UBE2F degradation leads to CRL5 inactivation and subsequent NOXA accumulation to suppress the growth of lung cancer cells. Collectively , our study establishes a negative regulatory axis between two neddylation E2s with UBE2M ubiquitylating UBE2F , and two CRLs with CRL3 inactivating CRL5.
