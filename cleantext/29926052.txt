  Two new fluorinated tetranitroadamantanes , 2,6-difluoro-2,4,4,6-tetranitroadamantane and 2,4,6,8-tetrafluoro-2,4,6,8-tetranitroadamantane , were synthesized. 2,6-Difluoro-2,4,4,6-tetranitroadamantane was prepared from 4,4-dinitroadamantane-2,6-dione by a three-step route with an overall yield of 40 %. It has a slightly higher crystal density ( 1.787 g cm-3) than its analogue 2,2,4,4,6,6-tetranitroadamantane ( 1.777 g cm-3). 2,4,6,8-Tetrafluoro-2,4,6,8-tetranitroadamantane was prepared from 4,8-dihydroxyadamantane-2,6-dione by an eight-step route with an overall yield of 8 %. It is notable that the replacement of one nitro group in the gem-dinitro functionality with fluorine might slightly reduce the detonation performance but improve the density and inherent steric hindrance , which makes it possible to introduce more nitro functionalities on the adamantane backbone.
