  CYP2C and CYP2 J enzymes , commonly named as cytochrome P450 ( CYP) epoxygenases , convert arachidonic acid to four regioisomeric epoxyeicosatrienoic acids ( EETs) , biologically active eicosanoids with many functions in organism. EETs are rapidly hydrolysed to less active dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids ( DHETs) by soluble epoxide hydrolase ( sEH). We investigated spatio-temporal expression pattern of CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2 J2 and sEH in normal human placenta by immunohistochemical method. In the villous trophoblast , CYP2C8 was the most abundant protein. Its expression is higher than the CYP2C9 and CYP2 J2 in the cytotrophoblast in the embryonic stage of development and remains higher in syncytiotrophoblast of term placenta. Unlike to CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 and CYP2 J2 expression decrease in term placenta. sEH expression increases with gestation age and is strictly limited to cytotrophoblast in embryonic and foetal stages of the development. Moreover , CYP2C8 shows more intensive staining than the other protein monitored in Hofbauer cells in villous stroma. Specific information regarding the exact role of EETs and DHETs functions in a normal placenta is still unknown. Based on CYP epoxygenases and sEH localization and well known information about the functions of placental structures during development , we suggest that these enzymes could play different roles in various cell populations in the placenta. As the placenta is absolutely crucial for prenatal development , arachidonic acid is essential part of human nutrient and CYP epoxygenases expression can be affected by xenobiotics , further investigation of the exact role of CYP epoxygenases , sEH , and their metabolites in normal pregnancy and under pathological conditions is needed.
