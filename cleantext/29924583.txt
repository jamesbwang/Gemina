  The melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 receptors ( MC3R and MC4R) , endogenous agonists derived from the proopiomelanocortin gene transcript , and naturally occurring antagonists agouti and agouti-related protein ( AGRP) have been linked to biological pathways associated with energy homeostasis. The active tripeptide sequence of AGRP , Arg111-Phe112-Phe113 , is located on a hypothesized Î²-hairpin loop. Herein , stereochemical modifications of the Arg-Phe-Phe sequence were examined in the octapeptide AGRP-derived macrocyclic scaffold c ( Pro-Arg-Phe-Phe-Xxx-Ala-Phe-DPro) , where Xxx was Asn or diaminopropionic acid ( Dap). Macrocyclic peptides were synthesized with one , two , or three residues of the Arg-Phe-Phe sequence substituted with the corresponding d-isomer ( s) , generating a 14 compound library. While l-to-d inversions of the Arg-Phe-Phe sequence in a 20-residue AGRP-derived ligand previously resulted in agonist activity at the MC1R , MC3R , MC4R , and MC5R , only the MC1R was consistently stimulated by the macrocyclic ligands in the present study , with varying ligand potencies and efficacies observed at the MC1R. A general trend of increased MC4R antagonist potency was observed for Dap-containing compounds , while MC5R inverse agonist activity was observed for select ligands. It was observed that stereochemical modification of the Arg-Phe-Phe active tripeptide sequence was insufficient to convert melanocortin antagonist into agonists. Overall , these observations are important in the design of melanocortin ligands possessing potent and selective agonist and antagonist activities.
