  Children born small for gestational age ( SGA) are more likely to develop high blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. In prior studies , longer sleep duration is associated with lower BP , and SGA is associated with shorter sleep duration in childhood. We investigated whether sleep duration in early childhood modifies the association between SGA and higher childhood SBP in 1178 children recruited at birth and followed up to age 9 years. We ascertained birthweight and gestational age from medical records. We derived child sleep duration from maternal questionnaire interview. We calculated child SBP percentile according to U.S. reference data. We defined elevated SBP as SBP â‰¥ 75
