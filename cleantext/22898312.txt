  This study aimed to compare the biomechanical stability of the fixation of mandibular sagittal split osteotomy of the ramus by two types of titanium miniplates in sheep mandibles. Seven preserved sheep mandibles with similar weight and size were selected , dissected with complete removal of soft-tissue structures , and sectioned in their midline. After performing sagittal split osteotomy , 5 mm of advancement was standardized and samples were divided into two groups according to the type of titanium miniplate ( GI = seven hemimandibles were fixed with straight titanium miniplate , GII = seven hemimandibles were fixed with L-shaped titanium miniplates) , and then subjected to compressive load. The means ( standard deviation) of the compressive load and extension values were 70.68 N ( 22.26) and 63.36 mm ( 15.60) to straight miniplates , and 78.80 N ( 32.54) and 70.55 mm ( 5.42) to L-shaped miniplates. After comparison and statistical analysis , the results showed no significant difference between the two types of titanium miniplates.
