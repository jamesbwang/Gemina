  Plant tolerance to freezing temperatures is governed by endogenous constitutive components and environmental inducing factors. Nitric oxide ( NO) is one of the endogenous components that participate in freezing tolerance regulation. A combined metabolomic and transcriptomic characterization of NO-deficient nia1,2noa1-2 mutant plants suggests that NO acts attenuating the production and accumulation of osmoprotective and regulatory metabolites , such as sugars and polyamines , stress-related hormones , such as ABA and jasmonates , and antioxidants , such as anthocyanins and flavonoids. Accordingly , NO-deficient plants are constitutively more freezing tolerant than wild type plants.
