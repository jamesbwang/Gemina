  Cottonseed is one of the most important raw materials for plant protein , oil and alternative biofuel for diesel engines. Understanding the complex genetic basis of cottonseed traits is requisite for achieving efficient genetic improvement of the traits. However , it is not yet clear about their genetic architecture in genomic level. GWAS has been an effective way to explore genetic basis of quantitative traits in human and many crops. This study aims to dissect genetic mechanism seven cottonseed traits by a GWAS for genetic improvement. A genome-wide association study ( GWAS) based on a full gene model with gene effects as fixed and gene-environment interaction as random , was conducted for protein , oil and 5 fatty acids using 316 accessions and ~ 390 K SNPs. Totally , 124 significant quantitative trait SNPs ( QTSs) , consisting of 16 , 21 , 87 for protein , oil and fatty acids ( palmitic , linoleic , oleic , myristic , stearic) , respectively , were identified and the broad-sense heritability was estimated from 71.62 to 93.43 %; no QTS-environment interaction was detected for the protein , the palmitic and the oleic contents; the protein content was predominantly controlled by epistatic effects accounting for 65.18 % of the total variation , but the oil content and the fatty acids except the palmitic were mainly determined by gene main effects and no epistasis was detected for the myristic and the stearic. Prediction of superior pure line and hybrid revealed the potential of the QTSs in the improvement of cottonseed traits , and the hybrid could achieve higher or lower genetic values compared with pure lines. This study revealed complex genetic architecture of seven cottonseed traits at whole genome-wide by mixed linear model approach; the identified genetic variants and estimated genetic component effects of gene , gene-gene and gene-environment interaction provide cotton geneticist or breeders new knowledge on the genetic mechanism of the traits and the potential molecular breeding design strategy.
