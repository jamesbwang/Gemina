  In this work , a novel molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor ( MIECS) based on a glassy carbon electrode ( GCE) modified with carbon dots ( CDs) and chitosan ( CS) for the determination of glucose was proposed for the first time. The use of the environmental-friendly CDs and CS as electrode modifications improved the active area and electron-transport ability substantially , while 3-aminobenzeneboronic acid was used as a functional monomer and glucose as template for the fabrication of molecularly imprinted polymer ( MIP) film to detect glucose via differential pulse voltammetry. Transmission electron microscope , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry , cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS) were applied to characterize the fabricated sensor. Experimental conditions such as molar ratio of functional monomer to template , volume ratio of CDs to CS , incubation time and elution time were optimized. By using glucose as a model analyte , the MIECS had two assay ranges of 0.5-40 μM and 50-600 μM , and fairly low limit of detection ( LOD) of 0.09 μM ( S/N = 3) under the optimized conditions. The MIECS also exhibited excellent selectivity , good reproducibility , and stability. The proposed sensor was successfully applied to a preliminary test for glucose analysis in real human blood serum samples.
