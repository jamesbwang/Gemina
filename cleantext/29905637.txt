  Primary extracranial meningioma is a rare tumor , unlike its common intracranial counterpart. Infrequently found in the head and neck region , it can cause local or neurologic symptoms depending on its location and interaction with cranial nerves. While uncommon , it is an important diagnosis to have on the differential of periorbital lesions<symptom> as surgical removal and prognosis are generally good. The authors present the first report of a patient with primary extracranial meningioma originating in the lacrimal sac fossa.
