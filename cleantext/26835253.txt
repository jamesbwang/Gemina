  This study was conducted to demonstrate the acaricide efficacy of novel indigenous veterinary medication shared by an outstanding knowledge holder against naturally infested cattle and efforts in mainstreaming such wisdom. An indigenous herbal medication in control of tick infestation was documented , and experimentation was held against naturally affected cattle. Eighteen clinically infested cattle population comprising 16 crossbred and 2 non-descript cattle were purposively selected. Majority of them were adult females , reported with a higher incidence of tick at Veterinary institution. The average pre-treatment tick count at 24 sites of observations among these animals was 18.91 ± 2.04 ( Mean ( x̄) ± standard error ( SE)). The medication was topically applied once daily for 2 days and post-treatment observations were recorded for an experimental period of 14 days ' duration. During 24-h post-treatment observation , the medication had shown 92.95 % acaricidal property with clinically irrelevant rate of tick infestation of 1.33 ± 0.39 ( x̄ ± SE) was noticed before application of subsequent ( second) dosage. This practice was found significantly effective at 5 % level of significance ( t The study strengthens the belief that indigenous herbal acaricide can facilitate quality livestock service at geographically distant locations. These medications can provide quicker relief , minimize tick resistance and are favorable to the environment.
