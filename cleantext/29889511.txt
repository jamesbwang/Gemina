  Camellia sinensis var. pubilimba , one variety of the genus Camellia sect. Thea ( Theaceae) , has been used for producing green tea mainly by the local people of its growing areas of Guangxi province , China. Forty compounds , including eight C-8 N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone-substituted flavan-3-ols ( 1-8) and their substituted unit N-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone ( 9) , four flavan-3-ol monomers ( 10-13) and one dimer ( 14) , nine flavonoids ( 15-23) , three hydrolyzable tannins ( 24-26) , two lignans ( 27-28) , 11 simple phenolics ( 29-39) , and caffeine ( 40) , were first isolated and identified from the leaves. Their structures were determined by detailed spectroscopic analysis and comparison with the literature data and authentic samples. Both 1 and 4 were obtained as a mixture of the N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone C-5 enantiomers ( 1a and 1b and 4a and 4b) , respectively , while the resolution of another three pairs of enantiomers ( 2 and 3 , 5 and 6 , and 7 and 8) was achieved. Among them , 1b is a new compound whose NMR data together with its enantiomer ( 1a) were reported for the first time , while 2 and 3 are two new natural products. Most of the isolates exhibited significant antioxidant activities , stronger than ascorbic acid and trolox , while parts of the isolates , particularly C-8 N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone-substituted flavan-3-ols , showed obvious inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase ( AChE). The results indicated that C. sinensis var. pubilimba is a valuable plant resource for tea production.
