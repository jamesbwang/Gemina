  In recent years , the incidence of thyroid cancer and obesity has increased rapidly worldwide. Many studies have been conducted on the relationship between thyroid cancer and obesity; however , the potential mechanisms are not well understood , and few studies have been performed in Asia. This study aimed to identify the relationship between the risk of thyroid cancer and obesity in the Korean population based on a large cohort of data. We analyzed clinical data from a total of 351,402 individuals ( males: 181,709 , females: 169,693) aged over 20 years who received medical examinations arranged by the national insurance program from 2003 to 2008. Newly diagnosed thyroid cancer was identified using insurance claims data. The median follow-up duration was 7.01 years. The mean body mass index ( BMI) of the subjects was 23.6 Â± 3.2 kg/m Our findings show that higher BMI is positively associated with the risk of thyroid cancer. Furthermore , this study supports the positive association between obesity and the increased incidence of thyroid cancer.
