  Food consumption can lead to the accumulation of certain chemical compounds able to exert toxic activities against humans. Of mayor interests are those molecules generated during food processing and handling , since their occurrence and distribution depend of many intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Cholesterol- a lipid constituent of mammalian cells- is the precursor of several toxic molecules known as cholesterol oxidation products ( COPs). In the last decades , it has been demonstrated that food processing can dramatically trigger COPs accumulation in meats , eggs , dairy products , fish and poultry. On the other hand , countless scientific evidences have pointed out the highly toxic and pathogenic activities of COPs , from cancer stimulation to neurodegenerative disorders , via molecular mechanisms that are largely unexplored. The aim of this review is to merge the evidence on COPs accumulation in foods and their toxic activities through dietary intake , as from in vivo and in vitro studies. We consider that it is imperative to systematically monitor the formation of COPs to bridge these quantitative efforts with a risk exposure assessment on sensitive populations.
