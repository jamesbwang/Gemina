  Biotransformation is an enzyme-catalyzed process in which the body converts endogenous compounds , xenobiotics and toxic substances into harmless or easily excreted metabolites. The biotransformation reactions are classified as phase I and II reactions. Uridine 5 '- diphospho ( UDP)- glucuronosyltransferases ( UGTs) are a superfamily of phase II enzymes which have roles in the conjugation of xenobiotics or endogenous compounds , including drugs and bilirubin , with glucuronic acid to make them easier to excrete. The method the human body uses to achieve glucuronidation may be affected by a large interindividual variation due to changes in the sequences of the genes encoding these enzymes. In the last five years , the study of the genetic variants of the UGTs at a molecular level has become important due to its association with several diseases and the ability to predict adverse events due to drug metabolism. In the present review , the structure and the prominent genetic variants of the UGT1A subfamily and their metabolic and clinical implications are described.
