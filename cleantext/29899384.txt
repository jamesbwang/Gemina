  In pediatric medicine , the usual treatment received by children ( `` standard of care '') varies across centers. Evaluations of new treatments often compare to the existing `` standard of care '' to determine if a treatment is more effective , has a better safety profile , or costs less. The objective of our study was to evaluate intervention and `` standard of care '' control arms reported in published pediatric clinical trials. Pediatric clinical trials , published in 2014 , reporting the use of a `` standard of care '' control arm were included. Duplicate assessment of reporting completeness was done using the 12-item TIDieR ( Template for Intervention Description and Replication) checklist for both the `` standard of care '' control arms and intervention arms within the same published study. Following screening , 214 pediatric trials in diverse therapeutic areas were included. Several different terms were used to describe `` standard of care. '' There was a significant difference between the mean reported TIDieR checklist items of `` standard of care '' control arms ( 5.81 ( SD 2.13) and intervention arms ( 8.45 ( SD 1.39 , p < 0.0001). Reporting of intervention and `` standard of care '' control arms in pediatric clinical trials should be improved as current `` standard of care '' reporting deficiencies limit reproducibility of research and may ultimately contribute to research waste.
