  We derive more than 80 embeddings of 2D hyperbolic honeycombs in Euclidean 3 space , forming 3-periodic infinite polyhedra with cubic symmetry. All embeddings are `` minimally frustrated , '' formed by removing just enough isometries of the ( regular , but unphysical) 2D hyperbolic honeycombs ( Formula: see text) , ( Formula: see text) , ( Formula: see text) , ( Formula: see text) , and ( Formula: see text) to allow embeddings in Euclidean 3 space. Nearly all of these triangulated `` simplicial polyhedra '' have symmetrically identical vertices , and most are chiral. The most symmetric examples include 10 infinite `` deltahedra , '' with equilateral triangular faces , 6 of which were previously unknown and some of which can be described as packings of Platonic deltahedra. We describe also related cubic crystalline packings of equal hyperbolic discs in 3 space that are frustrated analogues of optimally dense hyperbolic disc packings. The 10-coordinated packings are the least `` loosened '' Euclidean embeddings , although frustration swells all of the hyperbolic disc packings to give less dense arrays than the flat penny-packing even though their unfrustrated analogues in ( Formula: see text) are denser.
