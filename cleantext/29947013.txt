  Kinases and phosphatases are important players in growth signaling and are involved in cancer development. For development of targeted cancer therapy , attention is given to kinases rather than phosphatases inhibitors. Src homology region 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase2 ( SHP2) is overexpressed in different types of cancers. We investigated the SHP2-inhibitory effects of two new 5-aminosalicylate-4-thiazolinones in human cervical ( HeLa) and breast ( MCF-7 & MDA-MB-231) cancer cells. In-silico molecular docking showed preferential affinity of the two compounds towards the catalytic over the allosteric site of SHP2. An enzymatic assay confirmed the docking results whereby 0.01 Î¼M of both compounds reduced SHP2 activity to 50 %. On cellular level , the two compounds significantly reduced the expression of SHP2 , KRAS , p-ERK and p-STAT3 in HeLa but not in the other two cell lines. Phosphorylation of AKT and JNK was enhanced in HeLa and MCF7. Both compounds exhibited anti-proliferative/anti-migratory effects on HeLa and MCF7 but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. These results indicate that inhibition of SHP2 and its downstream pathways by the two compounds might be a promising strategy for cancer therapy in some but not all cancer types.
