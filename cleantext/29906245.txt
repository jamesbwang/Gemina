  The gut microbiota regulates key hepatic functions , notably through the production of bacterial metabolites that are transported via the portal circulation. We evaluated the effects of metabolites produced by the gut microbiota from aromatic amino acids ( phenylacetate , benzoate , p-cresol , and indole) on liver inflammation<symptom> induced by bacterial endotoxin. Precision-cut liver slices prepared from control mice , Kupffer cell ( KC)- depleted mice , and obese mice ( ob/ ob) were treated with or without LPS and bacterial metabolites. We observed beneficial effects of indole that dose-dependently reduced the LPS-induced up-regulation of proinflammatory mediators at both mRNA and protein levels in precision-cut liver slices prepared from control or ob/ ob mice. KC depletion partly prevented the antiinflammatory effects of indole , notably through a reduction of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing ( NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 ( NLRP3) pathway activation. In vivo , the oral administration of indole before an LPS injection reduced the expression of key proteins of the NF-κB pathway and downstream proinflammatory gene up-regulation. Indole also prevented LPS-induced alterations of cholesterol metabolism through a transcriptional regulation associated with increased 4β-hydroxycholesterol hepatic levels. In summary , indole appears as a bacterial metabolite produced from tryptophan that is able to counteract the detrimental effects of LPS in the liver. Indole could be a new target to develop innovative strategies to decrease hepatic inflammation.-Beaumont , M. , Neyrinck , A.
