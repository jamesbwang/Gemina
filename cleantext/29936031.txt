  Microbial pathogens have developed intriguing molecular strategies to modulate and/or control host cell functions to ensure their own survival and replication. During this molecular interplay between microbes and their respective hosts especially secreted virulence factors play a major role. These factors not only include a plethora of cytotoxins but also sophisticated effector proteins targeting intracellular decision points leading to inhibition of defense responses- and/or even to cell death. To be effective , most of these secreted factors have to get across the cytoplasmic membrane and reach their targets in the cytoplasm. Apparently , pathogens use multiple mechanisms to deliver virulence factors to their cytoplasmic destination. Here , we exemplarily discuss the recently emerging scenario of parallel strategies for the intracellular deployment of toxins and effector proteins of Gram-negative pathogens with a special focus on pathogenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> These pathogens employ various nanomachines such as the type III secretion system ( T3SS) , cell-penetrating effector proteins ( CPE) , and the wrapping of virulence factors in outer membrane vesicles ( OMV) for protection and parallel delivery. As intracellular delivery remains a major problem in drug development , potential therapeutic applications based on these bacterial strategies will be briefly discussed.
