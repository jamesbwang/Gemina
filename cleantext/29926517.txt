  Lepidopterans are known to have different pheromone-binding proteins with differential expression patterns that facilitate specific signal transduction of semiochemicals. Two PBPs of the Asian gypsy moth , Lymantria dispar<pathogen> , were reported to express in both females and males , but their physiological functions were unknown. Results showed that LdisPBP1 and LdisPBP2 were expressed in the sensilla trichodea of males and the s. trichodea and s. basiconica of females. When LdisPBP1 gene was targeted by RNA interference ( RNAi) in males , the expression of LdisPBP1 and LdisPBP2 decreased by 69 and 76 % , respectively , and when LdisPBP2 gene was targeted by RNAi , they decreased by 60 and 42 % , respectively. In females , after treatment with LdisPBP1 dsRNA , LdisPBP1 and LdisPBP2 levels were reduced by 26 and 69 % , respectively , and LdisPBP2 dsRNA reduced the relative expression of them by 4 and 62 % , respectively. The expression of LdisPBP1 and LdisPBP2 was interdependent. Electroantennogram ( EAG) recordings showed that LdisPBPs participate in the recognition of the sex pheromone in males , and the sex pheromone and plant volatiles in females. The function of LdisPBPs represents the sex-specific roles.
