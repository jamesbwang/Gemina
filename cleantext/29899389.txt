  Consistent with accepted practice in stable ambulatory populations , the majority of ICU research has evaluated vitamin D status using a single blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D level. Only a limited number of ICU studies have measured the active hormone , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ( calcitriol) and none have used change in calcitriol levels to evaluate axis functioning. The objective of this study was to describe the impact of Congenital Heart Disease ( CHD) surgery on calcitriol levels and evaluate the relationship between change in postoperative levels and clinical course. Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of 56 children undergoing surgery for CHD. Mean calcitriol levels dropped from 122.3 ± 69.1 pmol/L preoperatively to 65.3 ± 36.5 pmol/L ( p < 0.0001) at PICU admission. The majority ( 61 % , n = 34) were unable to increase calcitriol levels in the 48 h immediately following surgery. Post operative trend in calcitriol was inversely related to cardiovascular dysfunction , fluid requirements , ventilatory support and PICU length of stay ( p < 0.01). CHD patients had significant dysfunction of the vitamin D axis immediately postoperatively , demonstrated by both a significant intraoperative decline in calcitriol and inability to increase levels. Interventional research will be required to determine whether the use of calcitriol , in addition to cholecalciferol , reduces postoperative illness severity.
