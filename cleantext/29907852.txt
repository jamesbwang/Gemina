  Iron ( Fe) status of neonates born to women carrying multiple fetuses might be compromised as a consequence of the high prevalence of maternal Fe deficiency and anemia<symptom> coupled with an increased risk of preterm birth. This study aimed to characterize and identify determinants of anemia<symptom> in this neonatal population. Umbilical cord blood obtained from 183 neonates was utilized to assess hemoglobin ( Hb) , ferritin ( SF) , soluble transferrin receptor ( sTfR) , hepcidin , serum Fe , erythropoietin , folate , vitamin B-12 , C-reactive protein , and interleukin-6. Associations with maternal Fe status were explored. Cord Hb or SF did not change significantly as a function of gestational age at birth ( 25-38 wks). Neonates born to women who were obese prior to pregnancy or smoked cigarettes during pregnancy had a 4-5-fold greater odds of anemia<symptom> at birth. Cord sTfR was the strongest indicator of cord Hb ( P < 0.0001) , and it was significantly associated with maternal sTfR at mid-gestation ( P = 0.01) and delivery ( P = 0.002). Cord Fe indicators were significantly associated with cord hepcidin , but not maternal hepcidin. Screening for Fe status in neonates born to women carrying multiple fetuses is warranted , especially for those born to smokers or to women who are obese at entry into pregnancy.
