  There are potential advantages for using noninvasive methods instead of conventional approaches for measuring corticosterone ( CORT) as a metric of stress. Two studies compared blood heterophil: lymphocyte<symptom> ( H: L) ratios , serum CORT , cecal content CORT ( Study 1) , colon content CORT ( Study 2) , and feather CORT concentrations for broiler chicks receiving drinking water with or without added CORT. On day 28 , male broilers ( N = 140) were provided tap water ( Control group) or water containing 20 mg/L of CORT ( CORT group) for up to 72 h. Body<symptom> weight ( BW) , blood , feather , cecal , and colon content samples were collected from 10 birds from each treatment group at 0 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 30 , 48 , and 72 h. Data were analyzed with a JMP Pro ANOVA. Mean comparisons were analyzed on significant treatment effects using post hoc t-tests to compare control and CORT measures within each sampling time point. Pearson 's pairwise correlations for all data were performed. A treatment by time interaction affected all measures in both studies. In both studies , CORT treatment reduced body<symptom> weight and increased H: L ratios at later time points. In study 1 cecal content CORT concentrations were elevated with CORT treatment after 24 h , whereas in study 2 colon content CORT concentrations were elevated after 6 h. CORT treatment increased body and primary feather CORT and primary feather CORT increased with time in control groups in both studies. Serum CORT exhibited the lowest variability compared with all other sample sources used for determining CORT. Estimates of CORT by different methods were positively correlated. These results indicate that serum CORT concentrations most reliably reflect the CORT status of broilers , and that feather CORT concentrations demonstrated potential for estimating stress in broilers.
