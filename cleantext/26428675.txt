  It is well known that one of the main determinants of mortality and morbidity in chronic kidney disease ( CKD) and end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) patients is fluid overload acting on the cardiovascular system causing hypertension , increased arterial stiffness , left ventricular hypertrophy and eventually heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Therefore , assessment and management of volume status is crucial. Bioimpedance spectroscopy is one of the most popular and practical methods for volume evaluation. Volume evaluation should be a routine part of following CKD and ESRD patients , in order to decrease associated mortality and morbidity.
