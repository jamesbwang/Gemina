  Autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT) has been used in treatment for immunoglobulin light chain ( AL) amyloidosis for over 2 decades and is generally reserved for patients younger than 70 years. Herein we report on outcomes of ASCT in a cohort of patients with AL amyloidosis aged 70 years or older. Between August of 2002 and April of 2017 , 34 patients aged 70 years or older , with biopsy-proven AL amyloidosis , received an ASCT at the Mayo Clinic Rochester. Seventy percent of patients ( n = 24) were transplanted within 6 months of diagnosis , and 74 % ( n = 25) received reduced-intensity conditioning with melphalan < 200 mg/m
