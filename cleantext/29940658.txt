  Approximately 90,000 thyroid operations are performed in Germany each year. Minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy ( MIVAT) accounts for 5- 10 % of these operations. There are few data that compare long-term cosmetic results after MIVAT to those after conventional surgery. Current systematic reviews show no advantage for MIVAT. The goal of this study was to analyse the long-term postoperative results in both procedures and the evaluation of relevant factors. The analysis of the long-term results is based on follow-up examinations using a validated method for scar appraisal ( POSAS). Cohort analysis was performed on MIVAT operations in our hospital between 2004 and 2011 and conventional thyroid operations in 2011. Follow-up examination data were analysed from 117 patients from the MIVAT group and 102 patients from the conventional group. The follow-up examination was performed with a mean of 23.1 vs. 23.6 months postoperatively ( MIVAT vs. conventional). The Friedman Test showed that scar pigmentation ( mean rank 4.79) and scar surface structure ( mean rank 3.62) were the deciding factors influencing the long-term cosmetic results. Both MIVAT and conventional surgery gave very good long-term cosmetic results. From the patient 's perspective , there is no significant advantage with conventional surgery. The evaluation of the long-term results largely depends on factors such as scar pigmentation and surface structure that can only be influenced to a limited extent by the surgical procedure.
