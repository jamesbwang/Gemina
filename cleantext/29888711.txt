  Magnetic particle imaging ( MPI) is an imaging modality capable of quantitatively determining the 3D distribution of a magnetic nanoparticle ( MNP) ensemble. In this work , we present a method for reducing the MNP limit of detection by employing a new receive-only coil ( Rx-coil) for signal acquisition. The new signal detector is designed to improve the sensitivity and thus quality of reconstructed images. We present characterization measurements conducted with the prototype Rx-coil installed in a preclinical MPI scanner. The gradiometric design of the Rx-coil attenuates the unwanted signal contributions arising from the excitation field , leading to a 17 dB lower background level compared to the conventional dual-purpose coil ( TxRx-coil) , which is crucial for detecting low amounts of MNP. Network analyzer measurements of the frequency-dependent coil sensitivity , as well as spectral analysis of recorded MPI data demonstrate an overall increase of the coil sensitivity of about +12 dB for the Rx-coil. Comparisons of the sensitivity distributions revealed no significant degradations in terms of homogeneity for the Rx-coil compared to the TxRx-coil in an imaging volume of 6 × 3 × 3 cm
