  Adolescent relationships with parents are of the highest importance. The relationships likely reflect the nature of internal working models in youth sport that may well function as a psychological template during the construction of youth prosocial behavior. However , researchers ' focus to date has concerned specific aspects of parental practices in child-based sporting activities. There is a lack of research covering parent-athlete interpersonal relationships concerned with how the relationships affect adolescent prosocial behavior. The purpose of this mixed methods explanatory sequential study was to examine teenage athletes ' prosocial behavior and their relationships with parents. To achieve our purpose , we obtained quantitative data from 1348 athletes and non-athletes ( ages 12 ‚Åª 16) , and qualitative data from 12 adolescent athletes and 12 youth sports parents. In the quantitative phase , we assessed adolescent prosocial behavior regarding the following six forms of prosocial behavior: public , anonymous , dire , compliant , altruistic and emotional. In the qualitative follow-up , three themes emerged from the adolescent athlete 's perspective: ( 1) sport as an escape; ( 2) parent-child relationships in youth sports; ( 3) adolescents ' desired behavior. Three themes emerged from the parental perspective: ( 1) sport as protection and as a school of life; ( 2) painful decisions to release a child; ( 3) understanding adolescent behavior. We found protection from delinquent behavior and increased prosocial behavior with securely attached young athletes who are actively involved in sports.
