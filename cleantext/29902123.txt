  Urinary incontinence ( UI) can interfere with older women 's ability to perform activities of daily living ( ADLs) , but little is known about factors that predispose incontinent women to become functionally dependent or compromise their ability to serve as caregivers to others. UI , caregiving , and care-receiving behaviors were assessed by questionnaire in a national sample of community-dwelling older women. Multivariable models evaluated associations between incontinence and care dependence , assessed factors associated with care dependence among incontinent women , and compared health among female caregivers with and without incontinence. Of the 1703 women , 27 % reported weekly or more incontinence and 13 % monthly incontinence. Women with weekly or more incontinence were more likely than women without incontinence to report receiving care for ADLs ( AOR = 2.39 , CI = 1.61-3.56) or instrumental ADLs ( AOR = 1.94 , CI = 1.42-2.63). Compared to 46 % of women without incontinence , 60 % of women with monthly or weekly incontinence reported unmet care needs ( p = 0.0002). Factors associated with care dependence included more frequent incontinence , older age , marital status , and fair/poor health ( p < 0.05 for all). Overall , 15 % of women served as a caregiver for another adult , which did not differ by incontinence status ( p = 0.84) , but female caregivers with incontinence reported worse health than those without incontinence ( p = 0.0004). In this national cohort , older women with incontinence were more likely to be functionally dependent and have unmet care needs than those without incontinence , after adjustment for other factors. At least one in ten incontinent women served as caregivers , despite having worse health than female caregivers without incontinence.
