  Heart rate score ( HRSc) ≥ 70 % , a novel parameter , predicts risk of mortality in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and identifies patients who have survival benefit with DDDR vs DDD pacing. DDDR pacing lowers HRSc , and a dual sensor with minute ventilation ( MV) and accelerometer ( XL) improves HRSc more than accelerometer ( XL) alone in patients requiring pacemakers ( PMs). HRSc , the percentage of all beats in the predominant 10-beat/min device histogram bin , was calculated. Data from the Limiting Chronotropic Incompetence for Pacemaker Recipients Study , a prospective randomized trial of PM patients , comparing XL to dual-sensor ( XL + MV) rate-responsive pacing , were analyzed retrospectively for HRSc changes from baseline. The relationship of patient activity ( sensor-detected from device memory) to HRSc was examined. Of the 501 randomized patients , 215 ( 43 %) patients had HRSc ≥ 70 % during DDD pacing at baseline. In these patients , HRSc decreased after DDDR programming by 14.2 % , while it increased by 0.4 % in those with baseline HRSc < 70 % ( n = 286) ( HRSc ≥ 70 % vs HRSc < 70 %; P < .01). No differences were detected between the 2 randomized sensor-based groups at baseline. Dual-sensor ( MV + XL) programming reduced HRSc more than the XL sensor alone ( MV + XL: 18 % vs XL: 10 %; P < .001). No correlation was observed between patient activity and HRSc ( correlation = -0.14; P = .07). HRSc improved ( reduced) with rate-responsive ( DDDR) programming in PM patients with high HRSc during DDD pacing. Blended sensors ( MV + XL) improved HRSc more than XL alone. HRSc does not correlate with patient activity levels , suggesting that other patient factors determine this parameter. This programming approach needs to be investigated prospectively in a PM outcomes trial.
