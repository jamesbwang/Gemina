  All modern molecular biology and microbiology is underpinned by not only the tools to handle and manipulate microorganisms but also those to store , bank , and transport them. Glycerol is the current gold-standard cryoprotectant , but it is intrinsically toxic to most microorganisms: only a fraction of cells survive freezing and the presence of glycerol can impact downstream applications and assays. Extremophile organisms survive repeated freeze/thaw cycles by producing antifreeze proteins which are potent ice recrystallization inhibitors. Here we introduce a new concept for the storage/transport of microorganisms by using ice recrystallization inhibiting poly ( vinyl alcohol) in tandem with poly ( ethylene glycol). This cryopreserving formulation is shown to result in a 4-fold increase in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> yield post-thaw , compared to glycerol , utilizing lower concentrations , and successful cryopreservation shown as low as 1.1 wt % of additive. The mechanism of protection is demonstrated to be linked not only to inhibiting ice recrystallization ( by comparison to a recombinant antifreeze protein) but also to the significantly lower toxicity of the polymers compared to glycerol. Optimized formulations are presented and shown to be broadly applicable to the cryopreservation of a panel of Gram-negative , Gram-positive , and mycobacteria strains. This represents a step-change in how microorganisms will be stored by the design of new macromolecular ice growth inhibitors; it should enable a transition from traditional solvent-based to macromolecular microbiology storage methods.
