  A robotic mattress equipped with an interface pressure mapping system and an automatic inner air-cell pressure adjustment function had been developed to aid in the management of pressure ulcers<disease> , but its effects on comfort remained unclear. The present study aimed to investigate whether use of the mattress with continuous , automatic , interface pressure mapping-based regulation of inner air-cell pressure ( i.e. , robotic mattress) improves comfort over that provided by body weight-based pressure regulation ( traditional approach) in healthy volunteers. A robotic mattress was used with two settings ( i.e. , interface pressure-vs. body weight-based regulation). First , 20 healthy volunteers were recruited , and the level of comfort , interface pressure distribution , body immersion , and tissue oxygenation were measured and compared between the two settings. The level of comfort ( 20.5 vs 47.5 , p = 0.014) , contact area ( 2263.9 vs 2145.2 cm The robotic mattress provided improved comfort , which might be caused by increased contact area , and improved body immersion. The robotic mattress is expected to be effective both for managing pressure ulcers<disease> and increasing comfort.
