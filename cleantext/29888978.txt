  To determine the safety and diagnostic accuracy of renal tumour biopsies in a defined population of small renal masses only < 4 cm using 3x2 table , intention to diagnose approach. 3x2 table approach examines indeterminate results as a separate category rather than pushing these through traditional 2x2 table ( four-cell matrix) approach. A highly sensitive search was performed in the Cochrane Library , Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects; MEDLINE and MEDLINE in Process , EMBASE and conference proceedings ( 1966 to 2016) for the acquisition of data on the diagnostic accuracy and complications of RTB in patients with SRM < 4 cm. Methodological quality and risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS-2. Test characteristics were calculated using conventional 2x2 contingency table analysis excluding non-diagnostic biopsies , and an intention-to-diagnose approach with a 3x2 table for pooled estimates of the sensitivity and specificity. A total of 20 studies were included , with a total sample size of 974. The pooled estimates for sensitivity and specificity of RTB based upon univariate analysis using 2x2 table observed sensitivity .952 ( CI 0.908- 0.979) and specificity 0.824 ( CI 0.566- 0.962). Using the 3x2 table and intention-to-diagnose principle , sensitivity .947 ( CI 0.925- 0.965) and specificity 0.609 ( CI 0.385- 0.803) decreased. Renal tumour biopsy in small renal masses ( < 4 cm) is associated with a high diagnostic sensitivity but poor specificity when non-diagnostic results are included by a 3 Ã— 2 table for analysis ( intention to diagnose approach). Risk of non-diagnostic results and poor quality of research need addressing through future studies , preferably by a well-designed prospective study appropriately powered for diagnostic accuracy using valid reference standards.
