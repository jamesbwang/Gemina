  The International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision ( ISCEV) standard for full-field electroretinography ( ERG) describes a minimum procedure , but encourages more extensive testing. This ISCEV extended protocol describes an extension to the ERG standard , namely the photopic On-Off ERG , and outlines common clinical applications. A light stimulus duration of 150-200 ms is used in the presence of a rod-suppressing background to elicit cone-driven On- and Off-system ERG components. The On-response occurs after the stimulus onset and has a negative a-wave and positive b-wave. The Off d-wave is a positive component evoked by stimulus offset. Common diagnoses that may benefit from additional photopic On-Off ERG testing include retinal dystrophies and retinal disorders that cause dysfunction at a level that is post-phototransduction or post-receptoral. On-Off ERGs assess the relative involvement of On- and Off-systems and may be of use in the diagnosis of disorders such as complete and incomplete congenital stationary night blindness<symptom> ( complete and incomplete CSNB) , melanoma-associated retinopathy , and some forms of autoimmune retinopathy. The photopic On-Off ERGs may also be useful in X-linked retinoschisis , Batten disease , Duchenne muscular dystrophy , spinocerebellar degeneration , quinine toxicity , and other retinal disorders.
