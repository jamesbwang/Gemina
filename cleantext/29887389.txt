  The end of life is often associated with increased use of healthcare services. This increased use can include over-medicalisation , or over-treatment with interventions designed to cure that are likely futile in people who are dying. This is an issue with medical , ethical , and financial dimensions , and has implications for health policy , funding and the structure of care delivery. We measured the annual use of nine pre-defined public healthcare services between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2012 by elderly New Zealanders ( 65-99 years old) in their last year of life and compared it with that of the cohort of elderly New Zealanders who used healthcare in the period but did not die. We used linked , encrypted unique patient identifiers to reorganise and filter records in routinely collected national healthcare utilisation and mortality administrative datasets. We found that , in New Zealand , people do seem to use more of most health services in their last year of life than those of the same age who are not in their last year of life. However , as they advance in age , particularly after the age of 90 , this difference diminishes for most measures , although it is still substantial for days spent in hospital as an inpatient , and for pharmaceutical dispensings.
