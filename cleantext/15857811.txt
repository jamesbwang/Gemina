  Problem behaviours in dogs rehomed through animal shelters can jeopardise the long-term success of adoptions. In this study , data from 61 adolescent and adult dog adoptions that occurred through an animal shelter in Auckland , New Zealand , from 1 November 2015 to 31 July 2016 were analysed to describe the frequency of problem behaviours and level of adopter concern at different time points post-adoption. Amongst the 57 dogs with behavioural information available , 40 ( 70 %) had at least one reported problem behaviour , and the most frequently reported problem behaviours were poor manners ( 46 %) , destruction of household items ( 30 %) , and excessively high energy ( 28 %). Very few dogs showed territorial aggression when objects or food items were removed ( 2 % and 4 % , respectively). However , aggression toward people or other dogs was frequently reported ( 19 % and 19 % , respectively). Of the 54 adopters that provided a response about their level of concern over their dog & rsquo; s problem behaviours , 24 ( 44 %) were not concerned at all , 23 ( 43 %) were a little concerned , 4 ( 7 %) were moderately concerned , and 3 ( 6 %) were very concerned. Based on our interpretation of these findings , post-adoption support programmes targeted toward teaching adopters how to correctly train their dogs may be beneficial to increasing adoption satisfaction.
