  Endovascular embolization is an essential therapeutic approach in the multidisciplinary management of cerebral arteriovenous malformations ( AVM). However , it rarely occludes the AVM in its entirety. It is often combined with surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery. The aim of embolization is to reduce the size of the nidus and the intra-nidal flow in order to facilitate the microsurgical or the radiosurgical procedure. We report the case of a 61-year-old patient with a right frontal hemorrhagic AVM treated with complete embolization in a single session. Initially , a surgical procedure for excision of the AVM was scheduled 24hours post-embolization. This surgery was canceled due to a good angiographic result of the embolization. Eight days post-embolization , there was a massive re-bleed of the AVM which justified emergency surgical management. This case illustrates a delayed post-embolization hemorrhagic complication of an occluded AVM and prompts a review of the therapeutic strategy of the cerebral AVM to select the most effective and least morbid procedure or combination of procedures.
