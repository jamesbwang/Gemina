  Objective and Approach: Investigating properties of evolving functional brain networks has become a valuable tool to characterize the complex dynamics of the epileptic brain. Such networks are usually derived from electroencephalograms ( EEG) recorded with sensors implanted chronically into deeper structures of the brain and/or placed onto the cortex. It is still unclear , however , whether the use of different sensors for an identification of network nodes affects properties of functional brain networks. We address this question by investigating properties of links of such networks that we characterize by assessing interactions in multi-sensor , multi-day EEG data recorded from 49 epilepsy patients during presurgical evaluation. These data allow us to study the impact of different types of sensors together with the impact of various physiologic and pathophysiologic activities on the properties of links. We observe that different types of sensors differently impact on spatial means and temporal fluctuations of link strengths. Moreover , the impact depends on the relative anatomical location of sensors with respect to location and extent of sources of the prevailing activities. Type and location of sensors should be considered when constructing networks.
