  In Europe and North<pathogen> America , approximately 150 fatalities occur as a result of avalanches every year. However , it is unclear whether certain shovel shapes are more effective than others in snow removal during avalanche victim recovery. The objective was to determine the performance parameters with a developed standardized test using different shovel shapes and to determine sex-specific differences. Hence , several parameters were determined for clearing the snow from a snow filled box ( 15 men , 14 women). A flat ( F) and a deep ( D) shovel blade with the shaft connected straight ( S) or in clearing mode ( C) were used for the investigation of the shovel shapes FS , DC and the subsequent use of DC&DS. Mean snow mass shifted per unit time increased significantly from 1.50 kg/s with FS to 1.71 kg/s ( 14 %) with DS and further to 1.79 kg/s ( 4 %) with DC&DS for all participants. Snow mass shifted per unit time was 44 % higher ( p < 0.05) for men than for women. In excavation operations , the sex-specific physical performance should be taken into account. The results were limited to barely binding snow , because only with this snow did the tests show a high reliability.
