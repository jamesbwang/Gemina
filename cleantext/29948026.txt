  The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an extended use of 3D non-fluoroscopic mapping systems ( NMSs) during paediatric catheter ablation ( CA) in an adult EP Lab. This study includes 58 consecutive patients ( aged between 8 and 18) who underwent CA from March 2005 to February 2015. We compare the fluoroscopy data of two groups: group I , patients who underwent CA from 2005 to 2008 using only fluoroscopy , and group II , patients who underwent CA from 2008 to 2015 performed also using NMSs. Two cost-effectiveness analyses were carried out: the first method was based on the alpha value ( AV) , and the second one was based on the value of a statistical life ( VSL). For both methods , a children 's correction factor was also considered. The reduction cost estimated from all these methods was compared to the real additional cost of using NMSs. The use of an NMS during a CA procedure has led to an effective dose reduction ( Î”E) of 2.8 milli-Sievert. All presented methods are based on parameters with a wide range of values. The use of an NMS , applying directly AV values or VSL values , is not cost-effective for most countries. Only considering the children 's correction factor , the CA procedure using an NMS seems to be cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness of a systematic use of NMSs during CA procedures in children and teenagers remains a challenging task. A positive result depends on which value of AV or VSL is considered and if the children 's correction factor is applied or not.
