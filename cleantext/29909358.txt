  The basis and contribution of mesopores created in ZSM-5 structures at different treatment conditions are systematically investigated. The results reveal that the mesopores originated from the alkali dissolution of pristine ZSM-5 are mainly intracrystalline and they contribute to excessive Br√∏nsted acid sites , while the mesopores originated from the re-assembly of alkali dissolved aluminosilicate species possess Lewis acid sites. These ZSM-5 mesostructures showed an extended lifespan during the cracking of cumene ( 88.0 %) in comparison to the pristine ZSM-5 ( 27.0 %) after 460 min. The zeolite mesostructures obtained in this study could be used as a base for further design of new porous materials with desired acidic properties.
