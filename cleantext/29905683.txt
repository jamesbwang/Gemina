  Microwave absorber with broadband absorption and thin thickness is one of the main research interests in this field. A flexible ultrathin and broadband microwave absorber comprising multiwall carbon nanotubes , spherical carbonyl iron , and silicone rubber is fabricated in a newly proposed pyramidal spatial periodic structure ( SPS). The SPS with equivalent thickness of 3.73 mm covers the -10 dB and -15 dB absorption bandwidth in the frequency range 2-40 GHz and 10-40 GHz , respectively. The excellent absorption performance is achieved by concentration and dissipation of the electromagnetic field inside different parts of the magnetic-dielectric lossy protrusions in different frequency ranges.
