  Patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy ( MHE) show mild cognitive impairment associated with alterations in attentional and executive networks. There are no studies evaluating the relationship between memory in MHE and structural and functional connectivity ( FC) changes in the hippocampal system. This study aimed to evaluate verbal learning and long-term memory in cirrhotic patients with ( C-MHE) and without MHE ( C-NMHE) and healthy controls. We assessed the relationship between alterations in memory and the structural integrity and FC of the hippocampal system. C-MHE patients showed impairments in learning , long-term memory , and recognition , compared to C-NMHE patients and controls. Cirrhotic patients showed reduced fimbria volume compared to controls. Larger volumes in hippocampus subfields were related to better memory performance in C-NMHE patients and controls. C-MHE patients presented lower FC between the L-presubiculum and L-precuneus than C-NMHE patients. Compared to controls , C-MHE patients had reduced FC between L-presubiculum and subiculum seeds and bilateral precuneus , which correlated with cognitive impairment and memory performance. Alterations in the FC of the hippocampal system could contribute to learning and long-term memory<symptom> impairments<symptom> in C-MHE patients. This study demonstrates the association between alterations in learning and long-term memory and structural and FC disturbances in hippocampal structures in cirrhotic patients.
