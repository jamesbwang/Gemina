  Microwave-assisted freeze-drying ( MFD) is a rapid drying process well known in food technology. However , little is known about its application to biologicals. In this study , we investigated the applicability and feasibility of this technology to different monoclonal antibody formulations and the influence on the resulting product properties. Moreover , one of our main objectives was to study if significant reductions in drying times could be achieved. In addition , the effect of the drying process on the accelerated stability of a sucrose-based antibody formulation at 40 °C and 25 °C over 12 weeks was investigated. MFD resulted in drying time reduction > 75 %. For all model formulations , cake appearance and solid state properties were found to be comparable to standard lyophilized products. These formulations covered a wider range of lyophilization excipients comprising sucrose and trehalose , semi-crystalline forming solids like mannitol: sucrose mixtures and others like arginine phosphate and a mixture of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin with sucrose. Moreover , comparable low changes in relative monomer content , the relative amount of soluble aggregates and cumulative particles ≥ 1 μm per mL were observed over 12 weeks of storage , regardless of the drying technology. This makes MFD a promising innovative alternative for the rapid production of freeze-dried biologicals while maintaining product quality.
