  The objective of this study was to use parameters to determine the geometric differences between ruptured abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease> ( AAAs) and nonruptured AAAs. Computed tomography data of 38 ruptured AAAs and 215 electively repaired ( nonruptured) AAAs were collected from multiple institutes. We compared the ruptured AAA group and nonruptured AAA group with 1:1 matching by using the Mahalanobis distance , which was calculated using the patient 's age , sex , and AAA diameter. We selected the longitudinal AAA image in multiplanar reconstruction view , placed a hypothetical ellipse on the aneurysm<disease> 's protruded curve , and placed a circle on the portion connecting the aneurysm<disease> and the aorta. We then measured the aspect ratio ( the vertical diameter divided by the horizontal diameter) and fillet radius ( the radius of arc). The aspect ratio was significantly lower in the ruptured group than in the nonruptured group ( 2.02 ± 0.53 vs 2.60 ± 1.02; P = .002) , as was the fillet radius ( 0.28 ± 0.18 vs 0.81 ± 0.44; P < .001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the area under the curve of the aspect ratio was 0.688 , and the optimal cutoff point was 2.23 , with sensitivity and specificity of 0.55 and 0.76 , respectively. The area under the curve of the fillet radius was 0.933 , and the optimal cutoff was 0.347 , with sensitivity and specificity of 0.97 and 0.87 , respectively. The geometric analysis performed in this study revealed that ruptured AAAs had a smaller fillet radius and smaller aspect ratio than nonruptured AAAs did.
