  DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs) can be repaired by non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ) or homologous recombination ( HR). We demonstrate the selectivity of VX-984 , a DNA-PK inhibitor , using assays not previously reported. The class switch recombination assay ( CSR) in primary B cells was used to measure efficiency of NHEJ. A cellular reporter assay ( U2OS EJ-DR) was used to assess the efficiency of HR and NHEJ in cells treated with VX-984. Immunofluorescence assays ( IF) evaluated γ-H2AX foci for DSB repair kinetics in human astrocytes and T98G glioma cells. Western blotting was used to evaluate phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs substrates. We found a dose-dependent reduction in CSR efficiency with VX-984 , and through the EJ-DR assay , dramatic dose-dependent increases in HR and mNHEJ. Immunofluorescence assays showed an inability of malignant cells to resolve γ-H2AX foci in the presence of VX-984. Radiation-induced phosphorylation of DNA-PK substrates was further reduced by treatment with VX-984. VX-984 efficiently inhibits NHEJ , resulting in compensatory increases in alternative repair pathways , increases DSBs , and appears to affect transformed cells preferentially.
