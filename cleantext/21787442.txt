  Platforms for sharing genomic and phenotype data have been developed to promote genomic research , while maximizing the utility of existing datasets and minimizing the burden on participants. The value of genomic analysis of trios or family members has increased , especially in rare diseases and cancers. This article aims to argue the necessity of protection when sharing data from both patients and family members. Sharing patients ' and family members ' data collectively raises an ethical tension between the value of datasets and the rights of participants , and increases the risk of re-identification. However , current data-sharing policies have no specific safeguards or provisions for familial data sharing. A quantitative survey conducted on 10,881 general adults in Japan indicated that they expected stronger protection mechanisms when their family members ' clinical and/or genomic data were shared together , as compared to when only their data were shared. A framework that respects decision-making and the right of withdrawal of participants , including family members , along with ensuring usefulness and security of data is needed. To enable this , we propose recommendations on ancillary safeguards for familial data sharing according to the stakeholders , namely , initial researchers , genomic researchers , data submitters , database operators , institutional review boards , and the public and participants. Families have played significant roles in genetic research , and its value is re-illuminated in the era of genomic medicine. It is important to make progress in data sharing while simultaneously protecting the privacy and interests of patients and families , and return its benefits to them.
