  Current evidence suggests that estradiol ( E2) , the main ovarian steroid , modulates energy balance<symptom> by regulating both feeding and energy expenditure at the central level , through the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK). We hypothesized that the hypothalamic mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR) pathway , a well-established nutrient sensor and modulator of appetite<symptom> and puberty , could also mediate the anorectic effect of E2. Our data showed that ovariectomy ( OVX) elicited a marked downregulation of the mTOR signaling in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus ( ARC) , an effect that was reversed by either E2 replacement or central estrogen receptor alpha ( ERÎ±) agonism. The significance of this molecular signaling was given by the genetic inactivation of S6 kinase B1 ( S6K1 , a key downstream mTOR effector) in the ARC , which prevented the E2-induced hypophagia and weight<symptom> loss<symptom>. Overall , these data indicate that E2 induces hypophagia through modulation of mTOR pathway in the ARC.
