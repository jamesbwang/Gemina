  Independent component analysis ( ICA) and seed-based analyses are widely used techniques for studying intrinsic neuronal activity in task-based or resting scans. In this work , we show there is a direct link between the two , and show that there are some important differences between the two approaches in terms of what information they capture. We developed an enhanced connectivity-matrix independent component analysis ( cmICA) for calculating whole brain voxel maps of functional connectivity , which reduces the computational complexity of voxel-based connectivity analysis on performing many temporal correlations. We also show there is a mathematical equivalency between parcellations on voxel-to-voxel functional connectivity and simplified cmICA. Next , we used this cost-efficient data-driven method to examine the resting state fMRI connectivity in schizophrenia patients ( SZ) and healthy controls ( HC) on a whole brain scale and further quantified the relationship between brain functional connectivity and cognitive performances measured by the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia ( MATRICS) battery. Current results suggest that SZ exhibit a wide-range abnormality , primarily a decrease , in functional connectivity both between networks and within different network hubs. Specific functional connectivity decreases were associated with MATRICS performance deficits. In addition , we found that resting state functional connectivity decreases was extensively associated with aging regardless of groups. In contrast , there was no relationship between positive and negative symptoms in the patients and functional connectivity. In sum , we have developed a novel mathematical relationship between ICA and seed-based connectivity that reduces computational complexity , which has broad applicability , and showed a specific application of this approach to characterize connectivity changes associated with cognitive scores in SZ.
