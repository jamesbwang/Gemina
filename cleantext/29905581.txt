  Torticollis<symptom> could be the only symptom and sign of craniovertebral junction ( CVJ) abnormality. It could be difficult to identify CVJ abnormality as a cause of torticollis<symptom> due to their rarity , especially for the subjects with torticollis<symptom> caused by nontraumatic CVJ abnormalities. There has been no report to focus on nontraumatic CVJ abnormalities as a cause of torticollis<symptom>. The objective of this study was to report 27 patients of torticollis<symptom> caused by nontraumatic CVJ abnormalities , with the aim of helping clinicians to identify nontraumatic CVJ abnormalities as a cause of torticollis<symptom>. This is a retrospective cohort study including 27 subjects who had torticollis<symptom> caused by nontraumatic CVJ abnormalities. The CVJ was examined in terms of atlanto-occipital angle , atlanto-axial angle , and lateral and anterior atlanto-dens intervals for the evaluation of occipital condylar hypoplasia , rotation of atlanto-axial joint , and lateral and anterior shift of the dens , respectively. Abnormalities of the lower cervical or thoracic spine were also evaluated. Occipital condylar hypoplasia , rotation of atlanto-axial joint , and lateral shift of the dens were the most common CVJ abnormalities. The 18.5 % of the subjects had concurrent anomalies of lower cervical or thoracic vertebrae along with CVJ abnormalities. Each subject had 2.22 Â± 1.10 types of CVJ abnormalities on average. In conclusion , comprehensive evaluation of CVJ abnormalities is recommended for differential diagnosis of subjects with unexplained torticollis<symptom>. Once CVJ abnormalities are identified , concurrent abnormalities of other vertebrae need to be evaluated.
