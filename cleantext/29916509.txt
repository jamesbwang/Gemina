  Transition metal ( TM) oxides and hydroxides are one of the important candidates for the development of durable and low-cost electrocatalysts towards water splitting. The key issue is exploring effective methods to improve their electrocatalytic activity. Herein , we report a new type of P-doped Ni ( OH) 2/NiMoO4 hierarchical nanosheet array ( abbr. P-Ni ( OH) 2/NiMoO4) grown on Ni foam ( NF) , which can act as a highly efficient electrocatalyst towards overall water splitting. Such a composite was obtained by a three-step preparation process. In the first two hydrothermal reactions , the crystalline Ni ( OH) 2 hierarchical nanosheet arrays were grown on NF and then the low crystallinity NiMoO4 was grafted on the Ni ( OH) 2 nanosheets. In the third phosphorization step , P element was doped into the composite Ni ( OH) 2/NiMoO4. Electrocatalytic experiments show that P-Ni ( OH) 2/NiMoO4 possesses a smaller overpotential ( 60 mV) and lower Tafel slope ( 130 mV dec-1) toward HER in 1 M KOH. When it was employed as an integrated water splitting catalyst , only a potential of 1.55 V was required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2. This catalytic activity is even better than those of electrolyzers constructed with noble metals Pt/C âˆ¥ IrO2. The superior electrocatalytic performance of P-Ni ( OH) 2/NiMoO4 can be attributed to the high quality of crystalline Ni ( OH) 2 nanosheet arrays grown on NF , which dramatically improve the conductivity. Furthermore , the hierarchical structure not only increases the surface area and exposes more catalytically active sites , but also provides a superaerophobic surface , which helps to accelerate the release of generated bubbles. Moreover , the synergistic effects between P-Ni ( OH) 2 and P-NiMoO4 efficiently promote the HER and OER processes also. This work may suggest new a way to explore TM oxide/hydroxide-based durable electrocatalysts with highly efficient electrocatalytic activities towards overall water splitting.
