  To describe the use of intrauterine inflated Foley 's catheter balloon for control of postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> ( PPH) during cesarean section ( CS) in cases of abnormally invasive placenta previa aiming to preserve the uterus. Retrospective case-control study of the data of women who underwent elective CS on abnormally adherent placenta previa was carried out. Women in whom inflated Foley 's catheter balloon was used for control of PPH during CS ( Use of intrauterine inflated Foley 's catheter balloon significantly reduced the estimated amount of blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( Application of an intrauterine inflated Foley 's catheter balloon during CS in cases of morbidly adherent placenta previa helps to control PPH with preservation of the uterus and decreases the need for the invasive IIA ligation.
