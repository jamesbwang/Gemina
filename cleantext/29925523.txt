  To evaluate the impact of gender on the clinical and metabolic parameters in prepubertal growth hormone deficiency ( GHD) children at diagnosis and during GH treatment ( GHT). The data of 105 prepubertal children ( 61 males , 44 females , mean age 6.8 Â± 0.7 years) affected by idiopathic GHD were retrospectively evaluated. Body height , BMI , waist circumference ( WC) , IGF-I , HbA1c , lipid profile , fasting and after-OGTT glucose and insulin levels , insulin sensitivity and secretion indices were evaluated at baseline and after 24 months of GHT. At baseline , no significant difference was found in all clinical , hormonal and metabolic parameters between males and females. After 24 months of GHT , both males and females showed a significant increase in height ( both Twenty-four months of GHT in prepubertal children leads to different metabolic outcomes according to gender , with a greater reduction in insulin sensitivity in females , regardless of auxological and hormonal parameters. Therefore , prepubertal GHD females should probably need a more proper monitoring in clinical practice.
