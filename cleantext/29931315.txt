  The challenges of moving the pain education agenda forward are significant worldwide , and resources , including online , are needed to help educators in curriculum development. Online resources are available but with insufficient evaluation in the context of prelicensure pain education. Therefore , this pre-post study examined the impact of an innovative eLearning model: the Pain Education Interprofessional Resource ( PEIR) on usability , pain knowledge , beliefs , and understanding of pain assessment skills including empathy. Participants were students ( N = 96) recruited from seven prelicensure health sciences programs at the University of Toronto. They worked through three multifaceted modules , developed by an interprofessional team , that followed a patient with acute to persistent postsurgical pain up to one year. Module objectives , content , and assessment were based on International Association for the Study of Pain Pain<symptom> Curricula domains and related pain core competencies. Multimedia interactive components focused on pain mechanisms and key pain care issues. Outcome measures included previously validated tools; data were analyzed in SPSS. Online exercises provided concurrent individual feedback throughout all modules. The completion rate for modules and online assessments was 100 %. Overall usability scores ( SD) were strong 4.27/ 5 ( 0.56). On average , pain knowledge scores increased 20 % ( P < 0.001). The Pain Assessment Skills Tool was sensitive to differences in student and expert pain assessment evaluation ratings and was useful as a tool to deliver formative feedback while engaged in interactive eLearning about pain assessment. PEIR is an effective eLearning program with high student ratings for educational design and usability that significantly improved pain knowledge and understanding of collaborative care.
