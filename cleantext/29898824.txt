  Mandibular distraction osteogenesis and mandibular advancement , collectively referred to as mandibular advancement surgeries ( MAS) , have been used to treat children with mandibular insufficiency and obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA). The objective is to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis for MAS as treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Three authors searched multiple databases ( including PubMed/Medline) from inception through April 25 , 2018. 1198 studies were screened , 128 were downloaded and 37 met inclusion criteria ( 376 patients , mean age: 1.5 years). Meta-analysis demonstrated a reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI) , from a mean ± SD of 41.1 ± 35.8 to 4.5 ± 6.0 events per hour ( 89.1 % decrease). The lowest oxygen saturation ( LSAT) in 211 patients increased from a mean ± SD of 76.8 ± 13.0 to 91.1 ± 8.6 ( 14.3 oxygen saturation point increase). Individual patient data ( 105 patients) demonstrated AHI surgical success in 73.4 % of patients and respiratory disturbance index ( RDI) surgical success in 100 % of patients. AHI surgical cure was seen in 25.5 % of patients and RDI surgical cure was seen in 37.5 % of patients. This study 's major finding is that obstructive sleep apnea has dramatically improved in pediatric patients with mandibular insufficiency when they have been treated with mandibular advancement or mandibular distraction osteogenesis.
