  Percutaneous coronary interventions ( PCI) of old calcified saphenous vein grafts ( SVGs) is challenging and is associated with a considerably high risk of adverse ischemic events in the short- and long-term as compared to native coronary arteries. We report a case in which a non-dilatable , calcified SVG lesion<symptom> is successfully treated with rotational atherectomy followed by PCI and stenting with local stent delivery ( LSD) technique using the Guidezilla â„¢ guide extension catheter ( 5-in-6 Fr) in the `` child-in-mother '' fashion. A 70 years-old man with a dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy , triple coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG) in 1990 and chronic renal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( baseline GFR: 45 ml/min/1 .73 m Rotational atherectomy is a feasible option for non-dilatable stenoses in old SVGs when there is no evidence of thrombus or vessel dissection and the subsequent use of `` mother-and-child '' catheter has a key role , especially in case of radial approach , for long stents delivery.
