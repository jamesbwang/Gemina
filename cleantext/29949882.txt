  Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC) is a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer associated with a poor prognosis. This carcinoma was named after its presumed cell of origin , the Merkel cell , which is a mechanoreceptor cell located in the basal epidermal layer of the skin. Merkel cell polyomavirus<pathogen> seems to be the major causal factor for MCC because approximately 80 % of all MCCs are positive for viral DNAs. UV exposure is the predominant etiological factor for virus-negative MCCs. Intracellular microRNA analysis between virus-positive and virus-negative MCC cell lines and tumor samples have identified differentially expressed microRNAs. Comparative microRNA profiling has also been performed between MCCs and other non-MCC tumors , but not between normal Merkel cells and malignant Merkel cells. Finally , Merkel cell polyomavirus<pathogen> encodes one microRNA , but its expression in virus-positive MCCs is low , or non-detectable or absent , jeopardizing its biological relevance in tumorigenesis. Here , we review the results of microRNA studies in MCCs and discuss the potential application of microRNAs as biomarkers for the diagnosis , progression and prognosis , and treatment of MCC.
