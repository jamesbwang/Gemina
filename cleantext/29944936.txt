  Pirins are evolutionarily conserved iron-containing proteins that are found in all kingdoms of life , and have been implicated in diverse molecular processes , mostly associated with cellular stress. In the present study , we started from the evidence that the insertional inactivation of pirin-like gene SAM23877_RS18305 ( pirA) by Î¦C31 Att/Int system-based vectors in spiramycin-producing strain Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 23877 resulted in marked effects on central carbon and energy metabolism gene expression , high sensitivity to oxidative injury and repression of polyketide antibiotic production. By using integrated transcriptomic , proteomic and metabolite profiling , together with genetic complementation , we here show that most of these effects could be traced to the inability of the pirA-defective strain to modulate beta-oxidation pathway , leading to an unbalanced supply of precursor monomers for polyketide biosynthesis. Indeed , in silico protein-protein interaction modeling and in vitro experimental validation allowed us to demonstrate that PirA is a novel redox-sensitive negative modulator of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase , which catalyzes the first committed step of the beta-oxidation pathway.
