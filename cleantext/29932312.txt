  A novel conjugate between a cyclometalated platinum ( II) complex<pathogen> with dual antiangiogenic and antitumor activity and a cyclic peptide containing the RGD sequence (- Arg-Gly-Asp-) has been synthesized by combining solid- and solution-phase methodologies. Although peptide conjugation rendered a non-cytotoxic compound in all tested tumor cell lines ( ± α
