  Type 1 diabetes ( T1D) is an autoimmune disease , which is characterized by the destruction of islet Î² cells in the pancreas triggered by genetic and environmental factors. In past decades , extensive familial and genome-wide association studies have revealed more than 50 risk loci in the genome. However , genetic susceptibility can not explain the increased incidence of T1D worldwide , which is very likely attributed by the growing impact of environmental factors , especially gut microbiome. Recently , the role of gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of T1D has been uncovered by the increasing evidence from both human subjects and animal models , strongly indicating that gut microbiome might be a pivotal hub of T1D-triggering factors , especially environmental factors. In this review , we summarize the current aetiological and mechanism studies of gut microbiome in T1D. A better understanding of the role of gut microbiome in T1D may provide us with powerful prognostic and therapeutic tools in the near future.
