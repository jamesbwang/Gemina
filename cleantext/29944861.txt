  Synaptic refinement improves synaptic efficiency , which provides a possibility to improve memory in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). In the current study , we aimed to investigate the role of L-theanine , a natural constituent in green tea , in hippocampal synaptic transmission and to assess its potential to improve memory in transgenic AD mice. Initially , we found that L-theanine bath application facilitated hippocampal synaptic transmission and reduced paired-pulse facilitation ( PPF). These effects were blocked by antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors and the dopamine D1/5 receptor , and a selective protein kinase A ( PKA) inhibitor. Moreover , L-theanine enhanced PKA phosphorylation via dopamine D1/5 receptor activation. L-theanine did not influence hippocampal long-term potentiation ( LTP) in the slices obtained from wild-type mice , but rescued the impairment of hippocampal LTP in AD mice. Importantly , systemic application of L-theanine also improved memory and hippocampal LTP in AD mice. Our results demonstrate that L-theanine administration promotes hippocampal dopamine and noradrenaline release , and stimulates PKA phosphorylation. Moreover , the rescued hippocampal LTP in AD mice could be impaired by a PKA inhibitor. Our data reveal that L-theanine ameliorates the impairment of memory and hippocampal LTP in AD mice , likely through dopamine D1/5 receptor-PKA pathway activation. These data warrant the consideration of L-theanine as a candidate for the treatment of AD.
