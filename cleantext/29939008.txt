  We first verify the critical role of solvent evaporation on the resolution of inkjet printing. To confirm our hypothesis , we adjusted the evaporation rate gradient along the surface of adjacent droplets by controlling the drying microenvironment. Uneven solvent evaporation flux caused thermocapillary surface flow inward the space of micrometer-sized droplets and increase the air pressure , which prevented the neighboring droplets from coalescence. When reducing the droplet distance by the solvent evaporation-based method , a uniform profile could be obtained at the same time. This work brings us a step closer to resolving one of the critical bottlenecks to commercializing printed electronic goods.
