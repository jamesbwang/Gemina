  Body size is a key determinant of mortality risk. In natural populations , a broad range of relationships are observed between body size and mortality , including positive and negative correlations. Previous evolutionary modeling has shown that negatively size-dependent mortality can result in life-history bistability , with early maturation at small size and late maturation at large size representing alternative fitness optima. Here we present a general analysis of conditions under which such life-history bistabilities can occur , reporting the following findings. First , alternative fitness optima can be found for any arbitrarily chosen forms of mortality functions , including functions according to which mortality smoothly declines with size. Second , while bistabilities occur more readily under negatively size-dependent mortality , our analysis reveals that they can also emerge under positively size-dependent mortality , a feature missed in earlier work. Third , any sharp drop of mortality with size facilitates bistability. Fourth , if the mortality regime involves more than one such sharp drop , multistable life histories can occur , with alternative fitness optima straddling each of the drops. Paradoxically , our findings imply that , fifth , a species-poor predator community capable of creating a rugged mortality regime is conducive to evolutionary multistability , which could act as a stepping stone toward prey life-history diversification , whereas a species-rich predator community that results in a smoothly varying mortality regime may prevent diversification through this pathway.
