  To determine whether loss in thigh muscle strength in women concurrent with knee osteoarthritis progression is associated with reductions of muscle anatomical cross-sectional area ( ACSA) or specific-strength ( i.e. , isometric force ÷ ACSA) , and to explore relationships with local adiposity. Female participants from the Osteoarthritis Initiative with Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≤ 3 , thigh isometric strength measurements , and thigh magnetic resonance images at year-two ( Y2) and year-four ( Y4) ( n = 739 , age 62 ± 9 years; body mass index measurements ( BMI) 28.8 ± 5.9 kg/m Symptomatic progression was associated with a significantly greater loss ( p < 0.001) of knee extensor ACSA ( -2.0 % , 95 % CI -2.5 , -1.5) compared to those without progression ( -0.7 % , 95 % CI -1.0 , -0.4) , and greater loss ( p = 0.020) of knee flexor specific-strength ( -7.6 % , 95 % CI -11.5 , -3.7; vs -2.4 % , 95 % CI -4.8 , 0.0). Radiographic progression was associated with a significantly greater increase ( p = 0.023) in IMF ( +1.7 % , 95 % CI -0.1 , +3.6) compared to those without progression ( -0.6 % , 95 % CI -1.6 , +0.3). The significant reduction in thigh muscle strength concurrent with symptomatic progression in women appears to be associated with loss of extensor muscle ACSA and flexor specific-strength. In contrast , radiographic progression appears to be unrelated to muscle properties , but to be associated with local ( intermuscular) adiposity gains.
