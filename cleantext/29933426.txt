Qualitative study , based on the Theory of Social Representations.It was carried out with 12 elderly rural women from a city of Rio Grande do Sul , in July and August of 2013. The data obtained through a projective technique and semi-structured interviews has been analyzed through the reference of the Social Representations and content analysis.
