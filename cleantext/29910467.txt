  Obesity and diabetes in humans are associated with increased rates of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> To understand the role of the gut microbiome and brain insulin resistance in these disorders , we evaluated behaviors and insulin action in brain of mice with diet-induced obesity ( DIO) with and without antibiotic treatment. We find that DIO mice have behaviors reflective of increased anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> This is associated with decreased insulin signaling and increased inflammation<symptom> in in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Treatment with oral metronidazole or vancomycin decreases inflammation<symptom> , improves insulin signaling in the brain and reduces signs of anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> These effects are associated with changes in the levels of tryptophan , GABA , BDNF , amino acids , and multiple acylcarnitines , and are transferable to germ-free mice by fecal transplant. Thus , changes in gut microbiota can control brain insulin signaling and metabolite levels , and this leads to altered neurobehaviors.
