  Methane emission from the enteric fermentation of ruminant livestock is a main source of greenhouse gas ( GHG) emission and a major concern for global warming. Methane emission is also associated with dietary energy lose; hence , reduce feed efficiency. Due to the negative environmental impacts , methane mitigation has come forward in last few decades. To date numerous efforts were made in order to reduce methane emission from ruminants. No table mitigation approaches are rumen manipulation , alteration of rumen fermentation , modification of rumen microbial biodiversity by different means and rarely by animal manipulations. However , a comprehensive exploration for a sustainable methane mitigation approach is still lacking. Dietary modification is directly linked to changes in the rumen fermentation pattern and types of end products. Studies showed that changing fermentation pattern is one of the most effective ways of methane abatement. Desirable dietary changes provide two fold benefits i.e. improve production and reduce GHG emissions. Therefore , the aim of this review is to discuss biology of methane emission from ruminants and its mitigation through dietary manipulation.
