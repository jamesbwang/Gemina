  The aim of this study was to induce the remodeling of subcutaneous fibrosis<disease> in mice by the manual mobilization of skin and subcutaneous tissue. Seven days after the induction of subcutaneous fibrosis<disease> , mice were divided into 3 groups: control , stretch , and manual mobilization. Stretch was achieved by elongating the trunk , and manual mobilization was achieved by using the indicator fingertip of both hands , side by side , touching the back and performing a brief stretch. Stretch or manual mobilization was performed once a day for 7 days. Fibrosis<disease> was present in the subcutaneous tissue of control animals , whereas brief stretch and manual mobilization were found to reduce fibrosis<disease>. Mechanical stimulation through manual mobilization , or brief stretching , reduced subcutaneous fibrosis<disease> after tissue injury.
