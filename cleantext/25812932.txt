  Cardiac transplantation is the gold standard treatment for patients with advanced congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> that is refractory to maximal medical therapy. However , donor heart availability remains the major limiting factor , resulting in a large number of patients waiting long periods of time before transplantation. As a result , mechanical circulatory support devices have been increasingly used as a ` bridge ' in order to sustain organ function and stabilise haemodynamics while patients remain on the transplant waiting list or undergo left ventricular assist device surgery. Intra aortic balloon pumps ( IABP) are commonly used for temporary circulatory support in patients with advanced heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. IABP is traditionally placed percutaneously through the transfemoral artery approach. The major limitation with this approach is ambulatory restriction that can promote deconditioning , particularly in situations of prolonged circulatory support. A subclavian/axillary artery approach IABP insertion allows patients to be ambulatory during the pre-transplant period. In this review , we aim to summarise the physiology of IABP , the evidence for its use in advanced CHF and the efficacy and safety of subclavian artery IABP insertion.
