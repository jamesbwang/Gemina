  Spatially tailored pseudo-magnetic fields ( PMFs) can give rise to pseudo-Landau levels and the valley<disease> Hall effect in graphene. At an experimental level , it is highly challenging to create the specific strain texture that can generate PMFs over large areas. Here , we report that superposing graphene on multilayer black phosphorus creates shear-strained superlattices that generate a PMF over an entire graphene-black phosphorus heterostructure with edge size of tens of micrometres. The PMF is intertwined with the spatial period of the moir√© pattern , and its spatial distribution and intensity can be modified by changing the relative orientation of the two materials. We show that the emerging pseudo-Landau levels influence the transport properties of graphene-black phosphorus field-effect transistor devices with Hall bar geometry. The application of an external magnetic field allows us to enhance or reduce the effective field depending on the valley<disease> polarization with the prospect of developing a valley<disease> filter.
