  Alternative splicing enables organisms to produce the diversity of proteins necessary for multicellular life by using relatively few protein-coding genes. Although differences in splicing have been identified among divergent taxa , the shorter-term evolution of splicing is understudied. The origins of novel splice forms , and the contributions of alternative splicing to major evolutionary transitions , are largely unknown. This study used transcriptomes of wild and domesticated sunflowers to examine splice differentiation and regulation during domestication. We identified substantial splicing divergence between wild and domesticated sunflowers , mainly in the form of intron retention. Transcripts with divergent splicing were enriched for seed-development functions , suggesting that artificial selection impacted splicing patterns. Mapping of quantitative trait loci ( QTLs) associated with 144 differential splicing cases revealed primarily
