  T cells must migrate in order to encounter antigen-presenting cells ( APCs) and to execute their varied functions in immune defense and inflammation<symptom>. ATP release and autocrine signaling through purinergic receptors contribute to T cell activation at the immune synapse that T cells form with APCs. Here , we show that T cells also require ATP release and purinergic signaling for their migration to APCs. We found that the chemokine stromal-derived factor-1α ( SDF-1α) triggered mitochondrial ATP production , rapid bursts of ATP release , and increased migration of primary human CD4 + T cells. This process depended on pannexin-1 ATP release channels and autocrine stimulation of P2X4 receptors. SDF-1α stimulation caused localized accumulation of mitochondria with P2X4 receptors near the front of cells , resulting in a feed-forward signaling mechanism that promotes cellular Ca2 + influx and sustains mitochondrial ATP synthesis at levels needed for pseudopod protrusion , T cell polarization , and cell migration. Inhibition of P2X4 receptors blocked the activation and migration of T cells in vitro. In a mouse lung transplant model , P2X4 receptor antagonist treatment prevented the recruitment of T cells into allograft tissue and the rejection of lung transplants. Our findings suggest that P2X4 receptors are therapeutic targets for immunomodulation in transplantation and
