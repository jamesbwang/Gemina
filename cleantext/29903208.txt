  To establish a rapid and sensitive method for the analysis of eight bisphenols in breast milk using small amount of samples. Breast milk samples were extracted by acetonitrile and the lipid substances were removed by freezing under-20 ℃ condition. Then the samples were derivatized with dansyl chloride and analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( UPLCMS/MS). The seperation was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH Phenyl column ( 2. 1 mm × 100 mm , 1. 7 μm) with methanol and 0. 1 % formic acid in water as mobile phase. The electrospray source was in the positive ion mode and monitored in the multiple reactions monitoring mode. Isotope internal standard dilution technique was used for the quantification analysis. At last , the methodology was studied. The linear range of 8 bisphenols was 0. 010-10. 00 μg/L. The recoveries of the three spiked levels were84. 6 % -108. 1 % , with the relative standard deviations no more than 12 % ( n = 6). 30 samples of breast milk were analyzed , in which BPA was detected in 11 breast milk samples , and the concentrations ranged from 0. 13 μg/L to 2. 25 μg/L. BPAF was detected in 1 breast milk sample , and the concentration was 0. 02 μg/L. The established method using a small amount of breast milk is highly sensitive , simple and fast , and can be used for the simultaneous determination of 8 bisphenols in breast milk.
