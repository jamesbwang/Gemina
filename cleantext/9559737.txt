  Carotid atherosclerosis and giant cell arteritis ( GCA) are two distinct medical conditions with an overlapping clinical spectrum of vascular symptoms such as vision loss<symptom> and ischemic stroke. This is because both diseases cause arterial ischemia with a predilection for carotid vasculature. In addition , high-vascular risk individuals who are diagnosed with GCA are usually elderly with age > 55 years with high-vascular risk and thus can have underlying atherosclerosis. All these factors can pose a diagnostic dilemma for the physicians as GCA is a medical emergency which if left untreated can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Thus , it is important to avoid attributing occlusive arterial disease in elderly patients to atherosclerosis alone because some may have GCA. We present a case report in which presence of diffuse atherosclerosis was a major pitfall while making a timely diagnosis of GCA.
