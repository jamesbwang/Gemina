  Cystine-stabilized peptides have great utility as they naturally block ion channels , inhibit acetylcholine receptors , or inactivate microbes. However , only a tiny fraction of these peptides has been characterized. Exploration for novel peptides most efficiently starts with the identification of candidates from genome sequence data. Unfortunately , though cystine-stabilized peptides have shared structures , they have low DNA sequence similarity , restricting the utility of BLAST and even more powerful sequence alignment-based annotation algorithms , such as PSI-BLAST and HMMER. In contrast , a supervised machine learning approach may improve discovery and function assignment of these peptides. To this end , we employed our previously described m-NGSG algorithm , which utilizes hidden signatures embedded in peptide primary sequences that define and categorize structural or functional classes of peptides. From the generalized m-NGSG framework , we derived five specific models that categorize cystine-stabilized peptide sequences into specific functional classes. When compared with PSI-BLAST , HMMER and existing function-specific models , our novel approach ( named CSPred) consistently demonstrates superior performance in discovery and function-assignment. We also report an interactive version of CSPred , available through download ( https://bitbucket.org/sm_islam/cystine-stabilized-proteins/src) or web interface ( watson.ecs.baylor.edu/cspred) , for the discovery of cystine-stabilized peptides of specific function from genomic datasets and for genome annotation. We fully describe , in the Availability section following the Discussion , the quick and simple usage of the CsPred website to automatically deliver function assignments for batch submissions of peptide sequences.
