  The human genome harbors just 20,000 genes suggesting that the variety of possible protein products per gene plays a significant role in generating functional diversity. In bottom-up proteomics peptides are mapped back to proteins and proteoforms to describe a proteome; however , accurate quantitation of proteoforms is challenging due to incomplete protein sequence coverage and mapping ambiguities. Here , we demonstrate that a new software tool called ProteinClusterQuant ( PCQ) can be used to deduce the presence of proteoforms that would have otherwise been missed , as exemplified in a proteomic comparison of two fly species , Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis. PCQ was used to identify reduced levels of serine/threonine protein kinases PKN1 and PKN4 in CFBE41o
