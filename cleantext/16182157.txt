  Clinicians proceed the canal exploration according to the literature so far reported. At times , there are apparent variations in the teeth. These discrepancies should be thoroughly surveyed and piled up to date. One such rare complexity of canal morphology was discussed in the present case. A 48-year-old female patient referred to the endodontic clinic for full-mouth rehabilitation. On intraoral hard-tissue examination , decay was noted in multiple teeth which were confirmed by an orthopantomogram and endodontic treatment plan was suggested. The patient was prepared for the access opening of right mandibular first premolar ( tooth # 44) before which endodontic treatment of first and second quadrants was completed. The cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT) images revealed that tooth # 44 had two separate roots and four distinct root canals ( mesiobuccal , mesiolingual , distobuccal , and distolingual). Root canal treatment was completed in two visits. Postoperative CBCT was advised to confirm the obturation of all the canals.
