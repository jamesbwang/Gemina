  Paraoxonase-1 ( PON1) is a high-density lipoprotein-associated esterase and is speculated to play a role in several human<disease> diseases<disease> including diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Low PON1 activity has been associated with increased risk of major cardiovascular events , therefore a variety of studies have been conducted to establish the cardioprotective properties and clinical relevance of PON1. The major aim of this review was to highlight the important studies and to subsequently assess if PON1 has clinical relevance. A review of the literature showed that there is currently insufficient data to suggest that PON1 has clinical relevance. It is our opinion that robust studies are required to clarify the clinical relevance of PON1.
