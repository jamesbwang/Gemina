  Constraint-induced therapy ( CIT) is effective , but concerns have been repeatedly raised regarding the generalizability , feasibility , and potentially intrusive nature of restraining a child 's unimpaired upper limb. We examined the feasibility and efficacy of friendly-CIT , which uses home-based model , a caregiver-determined schedule , and gentle restraint , in children with cerebral palsy. In a one-group pre-post intervention trial , 15 children ( median of age = 8 years , 4 months) participated in 8 weeks of friendly-CIT ( 36 hours). Motor and psychosocial outcomes were investigated. Participants showed significant improvement on the manual dexterity subtest of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency ( p = 0.004); the how often ( p = 0.01) and how well ( p = 0.02) scales of the Revised Pediatric Motor Activity Log; and the functional skills score on the Chinese version of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory ( p = 0.002). For psychosocial outcomes , children with CP consistently demonstrated high engagement and increased playfulness ( p < 0.0001) during the 8-week intervention. Parents showed no change in stress status and high satisfaction with friendly-CIT. Friendly-CIT is feasible and promising for improving a child 's motor and psychosocial outcomes without increasing parental stress.
