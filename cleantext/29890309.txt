  Krüppel-like factor 3 ( KLF3) , a member of the Krüppel-like factor ( KLF) family , plays an important role in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether KLF3 could be used as a candidate gene in the breeding of cattle. The expression pattern of bovine KLF3 gene revealed that it was highly expressed in abdominal fat and perirenal fat. Using DNA sequencing , three single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) within the promoter regions of KLF3 gene were identified in 448 Qinchuan cattle , which are located in the recognition sequences of 11 transcription factors and the four haplotypes representing four potential different compositions of polymorphic potential cis-acting elements. Association analysis results indicated that individuals with the Hap7/7 diplotype showed higher ( P < 0.05) intramuscular fat content ( IFC) than those with H7/8. In addition , the H7 haplotype had much higher ( P < 0.05) transcriptional activity than the H8 haplotype , consistent with the association analysis. We speculated that polymorphisms in transcription factor binding sites of the KLF3 promoter region affected transcriptional activity of KLF3 , which subsequently influence intramuscular fat content in Qinchuan cattle and KLF3 gene could be used as molecular markers for fat deposition traits using early marker-assisted selection ( MAS) of Qinchuan cattle breeding in the future.
