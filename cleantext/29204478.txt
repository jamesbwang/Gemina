  The usage of low cost material as adsorbent would be admirable from environmental point of view. Thus , herein , this data set present a simple method for providing an adsorbent from activated carbon derived from pine tree. The prepared adsorbent was applied to remove diclofenac from aqueous solution. The characterization data of the adsorbent was analyzed using FTIR method. The FTIR test results showed that adsorbent has a functional group that is useful in adsorption process. It was conducted in laboratory scale and the adsorption technique was batch technique. The information regarding isotherms of diclofenac adsorption were listed. The Langmuir isotherm was suitable for correlation of equilibrium data with correlation coefficient value of 0.999. Adsorption of diclofenac by adsorbent from activated carbon follows pseudo second order model with correlation coefficient value (
