  Fatigue<symptom> is a common finding in multiple sclerosis ( MS) which may result in worsening of gait , function and other MS symptoms , like spasticity. Although the worsening of spasticity with fatigue<symptom> has been reported by persons with MS , the effect of fatigue<symptom> on spasticity has not been measured. The purpose of this study was to compare lower extremity Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS) scores of persons with mild-to-moderate MS symptoms before and after fatigued and unfatigued conditions. Using a randomized crossover design , MS subjects underwent 6-min walk to induce fatigue<symptom> and 6-min supine rests , with lower extremity spasticity measured before and after each condition. Friedman tests gave paired comparisons of MAS before and after each condition. 16 subjects with mild-to-moderate MS completed the study ( mean age = 56; standard deviation = 11.7). Friedman tests showed a significant decrease in mean rank for overall average MAS for both lower extremities ( p = 0.031) when comparing fatigued to unfatigued conditions. This appeared to be driven by the right<symptom> lower extremity average MAS ( p = 0.002) and , more specifically , in post hoc pre to post-test comparisons for right knee flexor ( p = 0.002 fatigued; p = 0.059 unfatigued) and right knee extensor ( p = 0.001 fatigued; p = 0.020 unfatigued) MAS mean rank differences. Fatigue<symptom> did not result in increased spasticity. Spasticity in these subjects with MS was not worsened by fatigue<symptom> suggesting that worsening of gait with fatigue<symptom> may be due to causes other than spasticity.
