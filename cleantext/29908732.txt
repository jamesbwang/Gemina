  The Tibetan Plateau ( TP) is recognized as `` Water Tower of Asia ''. Yet our understanding of mechanisms influencing incorporation of mercury ( Hg) into freshwater in mountain<disease> glaciers on the TP remains quite limited. Extensive sampling of environmental matrices ( e.g. , snow/ice) were conducted on the East Rongbuk glacier on Mt. Everest and Zhadang glacier on Mt. Nyainqentanglha for Hg speciation analysis. Speciated Hg behaved quite different during snowmelt: a preferential early release of DHg ( dissolved Hg) was observed at the onset of snowmelt , whereas PHg ( particulate-bound Hg) and THg ( total Hg) become relatively enriched in snow and released later. Small fraction of Hg in snow was lost during a snowmelt day ( 18.9 % -34.7 %) with a large proportion ( 58.1 % -87.3 %) contributed by PHg decrease , indicating that the deposited Hg is most likely retained in glacier snow/ice. Furthermore , THg were positively correlated with PHg and crustal major ions ( e.g. , Ca
