  Protective stepping after a loss of balance<symptom> is related to falls. Anticipatory postural responses ( APAs) prior to protective stepping can impact step performance , may be larger in people with PD , and have been suggested to be related to freezing of gait ( FOG). However , whether people with PD and FOG ( PD + FOG) exhibit larger APAs than people with PD and no FOG ( PD-FOG) is unknown. Determine the impact of freezing status on APAs prior to protective steps , thus providing a better understanding of the link between FOG and APAs. Twenty-eight people with PD ( 13 PD + FOG) were exposed to 50 support surface translations ( 25 forward , 25 backward , random order) resulting in protective steps. The size of medio-lateral weight shifts prior to the protective step ( i.e. APAs) , and the percentage of trials with an APA were calculated via force-plates. FOG status was assessed at the time of testing as well as 3.25 ( +/ -0.43) years later. Participants without FOG at testing , but with FOG at follow-up were identified as `` converters ''. For both forward and backward protective stepping , size and percentage trials with an APA were not statistically different between PD + FOG and PD-FOG , even after excluding converters from the PD-FOG group ( p > 0.27 for all). No group by direction interactions were observed. These data suggest that , in mild to moderate PD , an inability to couple APAs with stepping , rather than an inappropriately sized APA , may be most related to freezing of gait.
