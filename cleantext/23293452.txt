  With the advent of complex treatment techniques like volumetric modulated arc therapy , there has been increasing interest in treatment planning technologies aimed at reducing planning time. One of these such technologies is auto-planning , which is an automated planning module within Pinnacle Previous clinical plans were used to generate site-specific auto-planning templates. These templates were used to compare the 3 evaluated treatment sites. Plans were replanned using auto-planning and compared to the clinically delivered plans. For the planning target volume , the following metrics were evaluated: homogeneity index , conformity index , D For the prostate , there was as much as 6.8 % reduction in bladder D Our study showed improved organs at risk sparing in most organs while maintaining planning target volume coverage. Overall , auto-planning can generate plans that delivered the same target coverage as the clinical plans but offered significant reductions in mean dose to organs at risk.
