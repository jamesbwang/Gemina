  The cerebroplacental ratio ( CPR) Doppler has been proposed as an instrument for predicting adverse perinatal outcomes particularly during antepartum period. Abnormal CPR is associated with non-reassuring fetal status requiring operative delivery , low Apgar score and neonatal complications. The aim of this study was to assess the role of CPR Doppler in the labor triage suite , so as to identify fetuses at risk for non-reassuring status as well as other adverse perinatal outcomes. This was a prospective cohort study of term pregnancies who attended the labor room during the latent phase of labor. Both fetal Middle Cerebral Artery Pulsatility Index ( MCA-PI) and Umbilical Artery Pulsatility Index ( UA-PI) were measured and these values were converted to CPR values. Non-reassuring fetal status requiring operative delivery and other adverse perinatal outcomes were compared between women with normal and abnormal CPR values. Accuracy of CPR for predicting non-reassuring fetal status and abnormal fetal heart rate patterns were calculated. A total of 384 women were recruited. Lower CPR values were observed in women who underwent operative delivery for non-reassuring fetal status. However , when dividing women into normal and abnormal CPR groups , using 3 different cut-off values , the rate of non-reassuring fetal status was not significantly different between the groups. There was a significantly higher rate of abnormal fetal heart rate monitoring in fetuses with CPR < 5 In term fetuses , lower CPR is associated with non-reassuring fetal status. CPR measurement during the intrapartum period with currently available CPR cut-off values is not a good predictor for adverse perinatal outcomes , with the exception of abnormal fetal heart rate patterns. However , the high NPV may be used to stratify pregnant women who may benefit from continuous fetal heart rate monitoring.
