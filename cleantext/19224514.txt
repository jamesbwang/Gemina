  This study aimed to assess the predictive factor of multifocality to identify patients at high risk of central lymph node metastasis ( CLNM). Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma patients who underwent total or hemi-thyroidectomy with effective unilateral or bilateral central lymph node dissection were enrolled. Multifocality , age , sex , tumor size , extrathyroidal extension , and nodular goiter were significantly associated with CLNM. Multifocality was an independent predictor for CLNM in multivariate analysis. Compared with unifocal disease , the odds ratio for CLNM was 1.447 for patients with ≥ 2 tumor foci ( Multifocality with ≥ 3 tumor foci was an independent predictive factor for CLNM in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma. Multifocality should be assessed when selecting patients for prophylactic central neck<symptom> lymph node dissection , and we speculate that patients with multifocality should undergo more radical treatment.
