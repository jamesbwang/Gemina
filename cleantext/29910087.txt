  Aniba canelilla ( H.B.K.) Mez is an aromatic plant from the Amazon region whose essential oil has 1-nitro-2-phenylethane ( NP) and methyleugenol ( ME) as major compounds. Despite of the scientifically proven antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities for these compounds , there is no report up to date about the topical permeation or quantification of NP and ME on skin samples. The aim of this study was the validation of an optimized bioanalytical method by solid-phase microextraction in headspace mode in gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector ( HS-SPME-GC-FID) for the determination of NP and ME from the oil in different samples from permeation study , such as porcine ear skin ( PES) layers ( stratum corneum , epidermis and dermis) and receptor fluid ( RF). For this propose polydimethylsiloxane fibers ( 100 μm) were used and HS-SPME extraction condition consisted of 53 °C , 21 min , and 5 % w.v
