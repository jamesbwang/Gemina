  Comments on an editorial by C. T. Fogarty and L. B. Mauksch ( see record 2017-56601-001). The editorial discussed collaborative family health care and the importance of family and social context to yield a comprehensive understanding of health. Jacobs agrees that family systemic thinking is an extremely helpful tool for clinicians , even if there 's limited data to prove that. But he also thinks that systemic thinking in and of itself does n't flatten the health care hierarchy and empower family members. ( PsycINFO Database Record
