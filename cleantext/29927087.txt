  Patient 's long-term phenomenology after first-episode psychosis could be blurred due to early intervention. The contradictory messages regarding necessity of long-term antipsychotic treatment derived from different methodologies warrants careful reappraisal. We approached a group of patients lost to follow-up in a previous study. Targeting these 44 missing patients , we sent 2 carefully worded letters to invite them for interviews to see if their life trajectories were different from those who stayed in a university-based hospital system. A total of 21 patients replied , but only 8 agreed to in-depth interviews. Of these , 2 warranted revision of their diagnoses as there had been no recurrence of psychotic symptoms and they had remained antipsychotic-free for several years despite displaying a dysthymic state; 1 fulfilled remission criteria on intermittent low-dose antipsychotics but kept a distance from any potential stressor; 1 achieved full remission with good functioning and discontinued medications for a year , but resumed taking antipsychotics after feeling an impending relapse; the other 4 showed common courses of chronic schizophrenia with repeated admission and/or rehabilitation programs in other service systems. The trajectories after first-episode psychosis should not be over-simplified by calculating the probability of relapse or the odds of achieving adequate functioning determined by medication adherence or not. Examining from a dynamic perspective employing a qualitative approach to take into account diagnostic stability , treatment preferences , psychosocial factors , individual coping strategies and personalized formulation of illness , we can gain more insight into the ambiguous information revealed by the recent literature.
