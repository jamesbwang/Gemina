  Anticoagulation in conjunction with antiplatelet therapy is central to the management of acute coronary syndromes<disease> ( ACS). When used effectively it is associated with a reduction in recurrent ischaemic events including myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis as well as a reduction in death. Effective ischaemic risk reduction whilst balancing bleeding risk remains a clinical challenge. This article reviews the current available evidence for anticoagulation in ACS and recommendations from the European Society of Cardiology.
