  Genome-resolved metagenomics allows the construction of draft microbial genomes from short-read shotgun metagenomics ( Metagenome-Assembled Genomes , or MAGs); however , even high-quality MAGs are typically somewhat incomplete and contain a small amount of contaminant sequence , making accurate prediction of metabolic potential challenging. Here we describe MetaPOAP , an algorithm for probabalistic assessment of the statistical likelihoods for the presence or absence of metabolic pathways in MAGs. MetaPOAP is available as a Python script on GitHub or directly from the Fischer lab webpage. Example implementation of MetaPOAP is available as Supplemental Information.
