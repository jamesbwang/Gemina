  Rifaximin is a poorly absorbable antibiotic with a broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-negative and- positive bacteria. It is active in the small intestine due to its high bile solubility , whereas in the aqueous environment of the colon , it shows limited efficacy against highly susceptible bacteria. These unique pharmacokinetic properties limit its systemic effects and can correct gut microflora imbalances. Thus , rifaximin has become a major therapeutic agent in several gastrointestinal diseases in which an imbalance in gut microflora may play a role , including diarrhea<disease> predominant irritable bowel syndrome<disease> ( IBS-D). Area covered: This is an up-to-date review focusing on the efficacy of rifaximin in the treatment of IBS-D in both adult and pediatric populations. We will review the pharmacokinetic properties of rifaximin , including its absorption in health and disease , mechanisms of action , and interactions with other drugs. Expert opinion: Given its safety profile and its negligible absorption , rifaximin is a suitable treatment for IBS-D , in both adults and children. The possibility of modulating gut microbiota composition without side effects has made this drug an appealing therapeutic agent in highly prevalent gastrointestinal diseases. However , to date , monitoring for the development of resistant bacterial strains during long-term rifaximin use is still lacking.
