  This paper is concerned to the fire localization problem for large-space buildings. Two kinds of circular fire source arrangement localization methods are proposed on the basis of the dynamic optimization technology. In the Range-Point-Range frame , a dynamic optimization localization is proposed to globally estimate the circle center of the circular arrangement to be determined based on all the point estimates of the fire source. In the Range-Range-Range frame , a dynamic optimization localization method is developed by solving a non-convex optimization problem. In this way , the circle center and the radius are obtained simultaneously. Additionally , the dynamic angle bisector method is evaluated. Finally , a simulation with three simulation scenes is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and availability of the proposed methods.
