  Copper nanoparticles with the diameter of 50 ± 20 nm decorated nitrogen doped graphite oxide ( NGO) have been prepared through a simple single step carbonization method using copper metal-organic framework ( MOF) , ( Cu ₂ ( BDC) ₂ ( DABCO)) ( where BDC is 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate , and DABCO is 1,4-Diazabicyclo ( 2.2.2) octane) as precursor. The surface morphology , porosity , surface area and elemental composition of CuNPs/NGO were characterized by various techniques. The as-synthesized CuNPs/NGO nanomaterials were coated on commercially available disposable screen-printed carbon electrode for the sensitive determination of glucose. We find that the modified electrode can detect glucose between 1 & mu; M and 1803 & mu; M ( linear range) with good sensitivity ( 2500 & mu; A mM
