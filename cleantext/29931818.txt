  NiFe layered double hydroxide is inarguably the most ac ¬ tive contemporary catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction under alkaline conditions. However , the ability to sustain unattenuated per-formance under challenging industrial conditions entailing high corro ¬ sivity of the electrolyte ( ~ 30 wt. % KOH) , high temperature ( > 80 oC) and high current densities ( > 500 mA cm-2) is the ultimate criterion for practical viability. Here , we evaluate the chemical and structural stabi ¬ lity of NiFe LDH at conditions akin to practical electrolysis , in 30 % KOH at 80 °C , however , without electrochemical polarization , and the resulting impact on the OER performance of the catalyst. Post-analy ¬ sis of the catalyst by means of XRD , TEM , FT-IR and Raman spec ¬ troscopy after its immersion into 30 % M KOH at 80 oC for 60 h re ¬ vealed a transformation of the structure from NiFe LDH to a mixture of crystalline ß-Ni ( OH) 2 and discrete predominantly amorphous FeOOH containing minor non-homogeneously distributed crystalline domains. These structural and compositional changes were leading to a drastic loss of the OER activity. We therefore recommend study ¬ ing catalyst stability at industrially relevant conditions.
