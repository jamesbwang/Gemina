  NCAM1 and NCAM2 have ectodomains consisting of 5 Ig domains followed by 2 membrane-proximal FnIII domains. In this study we investigate and compare the structures and functions of these FnIII domains. The NCAM1 and -2 FnIII2 domains both contain a Walker A motif. In NCAM1 binding of ATP to this motif interferes with NCAM1 binding to FGFR. We obtained a structural model of the NCAM2 FnIII2 domain by NMR spectroscopy , and by titration with an ATP analogue we show that the NCAM2 Walker A motif does not bind ATP. Small angle X-ray scattering ( SAXS) data revealed that the NCAM2 FnIII1-2 double domain exhibits a very low degree of flexibility. Moreover , recombinant NCAM2 FnIII domains bind FGFR in vitro , and the FnIII1-2 double domain induces neurite outgrowth in a concentration-dependent manner through activation of FGFR. Several synthetic NCAM1-derived peptides induce neurite outgrowth via FGFR. Only 2 of 5 peptides derived from similar regions in NCAM2 induce neurite outgrowth , but the most potent of these peptides stimulates neurite outgrowth through FGFR-dependent activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway. These results reveal that the NCAM2 FnIII domains form a rigid structure that binds and activates FGFR in a manner related to , but different from NCAM1.
