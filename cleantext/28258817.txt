  Malaria<disease> case management in the context of the 2014-2016 West African Ebola<disease> virus<disease> disease<disease> ( EVD) epidemic was complicated by a similar initial clinical presentation of the two diseases. In September 2014 , the World Health Organization ( WHO) released recommendations titled , `` Guidance on temporary malaria<disease> control measures in Ebola-affected countries '' , which aimed at reducing the risk of EVD transmission and improving malaria<disease> outcomes. This guidance recommended malaria<disease> diagnostic testing of fever<disease> cases only if adequate personal protective equipment ( PPE) was available , defined as examination gloves , face shield , disposable gown , boots , and head cover; otherwise presumptive anti-malarial treatment was recommended. The extent to which health workers adhered to these guidelines in affected countries has not been assessed. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 118 health units in Guinea in November 2014 to produce a representative and probabilistic sample of health facilities and patients. Adherence to the EVD-specific malaria<disease> case management guidelines during the height of the EVD epidemic was assessed. Associations between case management practices and possible determinants were calculated using multivariate logistic regression , controlling for expected confounders and the complex sample design. Most ( 78 %) facilities reported availability of examination gloves , but adequate PPE was available at only 27 % of facilities. Only 28 % of febrile patients received correct malaria<disease> case management per the WHO temporary malaria<disease> case management guidelines. The most common error was diagnostic testing in the absence of adequate PPE ( 45 % of febrile patients) , followed by no presumptive treatment in the absence of adequate PPE ( 14 %). Having had a report of an EVD case at a health facility and health worker-reported participation in EVD-specific malaria<disease> trainings were associated with lower odds of diagnostic testing and higher odds of presumptive treatment. Adherence to guidance on malaria<disease> case management in EVD-affected countries was low at the height of the EVD epidemic in Guinea , and there was substantial malaria<disease> diagnostic testing in the absence of adequate PPE , which could have contributed to increased EVD transmission in the healthcare setting. Conversely , low presumptive treatment when diagnostic tests were not performed may have led to additional morbidity and mortality among malaria<disease> positive patients. National malaria<disease> control programs may consider preparing contingency plans for future implementation of temporary changes to malaria<disease> case management guidelines to facilitate uptake by health workers. Additional training on standard and transmission-based precautions should help health workers understand how to protect themselves in the face of emerging and unknown pathogens.
