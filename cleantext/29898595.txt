  Dispersion and biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons are significantly enhanced by formation of oil-suspended particulate matter aggregates ( OSAs) , but little is known about their adverse effects on benthic invertebrates or microbes. In this study , we investigated: ( 1) bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) by the marine bivalve , Mactra veneriformis and ( 2) changes in composition and relative abundances of microbes , during 50-d of an OSAs feeding experiment. Total concentrations of PAHs increased more rapidly during the first week of exposure , peaked at Day 30 , then gradually declined to the end of experiment. While bioaccumulation of PAHs by clams varied among the 20 target compounds , two major groups of PAHs were identified by cluster analysis. One group including 3-methylphenanthrene , 1,6-dimethylphenanthrene , 1,2,6,9-tetramethylphenanthrene , and benzo ( a) anthracene showed a fairly constant rate of accumulation , while the second group including 2-methyldibenzothiophene , 2,4-dimethyldibenzothiophene , 2,4,7-trimethyldibenzothiophene , 3-methylchrysene , 6-ethylchrysene , and 1,3,6-trimethylchrysene exhibited a bell-shaped pattern. Bioaccumulation of PAHs by clams was dependent on changes in abundance of Gammaproteobacteria , indicating active degradations of hydrocarbons by selected species. Six key species included: Porticoccus litoralis , Porticoccus hydrocarbonoclasticus , Cycloclasticus spirillensus , Alcanivorax borkumensis , Alcanivorax dieselolei , and Alkalimarinus sediminis. These results are the first to demonstrate interactions of OSAs and macrofauna/microbe in oil cleanup operations.
