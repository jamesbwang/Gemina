  We investigated the validity of the clinical pathway of early oral intake using a special type of food `` iEat ™ '' for patients after laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery. Fifty-two patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer between April 2012 and October 2013 were the participants. We provided postoperative care in accordance with a clinical pathway for laparoscopic gastrectomy that begins oral intake with `` iEat ™ the day after surgery. We examined complications resulting from oral intake , postoperative complications , and the length of postoperative hospital stay. Of the 52 patients , 30 underwent distal gastrectomy and 22 underwent total gastrectomy. 50 patients was able to start early oral intake in accordance with our clinical pathway. No anastomotic leak complications were observed , and 9 patients ( 17.3 %) developed complications as results of surgery. There was no complication related to early oral intake with `` iEat ™ ''. Re-operation were performed in two cases. Overall mean and median postoperative hospital stays were 8.3 days and 6 days , respectively. There was a single case of hospital re-admission. The completion rate of this early oral intake clinical pathway was 86.5 %. Clinical pathway of recovery program combined laparoscopic suregry and early oral intake with `` iEat ™ '' could be useful for gastric cancer. This study indicates that using non-liquid food like iEat ™ can be feasiblel , and water or liquid food do n't have to be used in early oral feeding after laparoscopic gastrectomy.
