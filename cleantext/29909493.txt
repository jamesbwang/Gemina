  Mast cells ( MCs) are long-lived immune cells of the connective tissue which play a key role in development and amplification of inflammatory process initiated inter alia by allergic reactions or microbial infections. They reside in strategic locations in the body that are notably exposed to deleterious factors disturbing homeostasis , which enables them to become one of the first-line defense strategy. MCs have developed a wide range of various mechanisms to deal with invading intruders and harmful endogenic factors. Those include storage and synthesis with a subsequent release of inflammatory mediators , forming of MC-extracellular traps , and phagocytosis. Particularly , important role in microbial sensing is achieved due to the presence of different pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs). The best-described receptors are Toll-like receptors activated by different pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns. However , MCs express also C-type lectin receptors specialized in antifungal defense , NOD-like receptors detecting bacterial peptidoglycans , and RIG-like receptors relevant in viral sensing. This review will focus on the current knowledge of PRRs expressed within different types of MCs.
