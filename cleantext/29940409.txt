  Squamata are reptiles that diverged from mammals 300 million years ago. During this period , the immunoglobulin ( IG) and T lymphocyte<symptom> receptor ( TCR) genes evolved parallel to mammals. However , unlike mammals whose IG/TCR locus has retained a constant structure throughout evolution , Squamata have witnessed duplications , losses , and/or gains in the domains of their immunoglobulin genes. The recent genome sequencing of Shinisaurus crocodilurus , a representative species of the oldest reptiles , provides an opportunity to contrast the structure of IG and TCR genes from previously studied Squamata. This study revealed ten immunoglobulin genes: five genes for immunoglobulin M ( IgM) , two for immunoglobulin D ( IgD) , one for immunoglobulin D2 ( IgD2) , and two for immunoglobulin Y ( IgY). As in other Squamata , there are genes for the λ light chain ( IGLV) but not for the κ chain ( IGKV). Here , the data shows that in some IgM genes , the cysteine needed to bind the λ chains does not exist , but we present evidence for possible non-covalent binding to the light chain. With respect to TCR , one gene is detected for the α constant chain ( TRAC) and two genes for the β constant chain ( TRBC); one of which is located in the locus of the variable regions of the heavy chain. As in the rest of the Squamata , genes for the γ/δ T cell receptor were not found. The V gene repertoire is found to be consistent with all other Squamata with few V genes for beta chain of TCR.
