  It is well known that development of acute kidney injury ( AKI) increases mortality in hospitalized cirrhotic patients; therefore many novel markers have been studied for early detection , differential diagnosis and prognosis in cirrhotic patients with AKI. The aim of the current work is to evaluate urinary Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin ( uNGAL) as a diagnostic biomarker for different causes of acute kidney injury in liver cirrhosis and to assess it as a prognostic marker. Out of 83 cirrhotic patients with AKI admitted between October 2015 and June 2016; 70 patients were included in this prospective study. Routine laboratory tests , uNGAL and fractional excretion of Na were obtained on admission. End points were death or improvement of kidney function and discharge. The patients included in our study were 41 males and 29 females with mean age 54.27 ± 6.08 years. HCV was the etiology of cirrhosis in 69 cases while one had combined HBV and HCV infection. More than 50 % of patients were classified as Child C. Causes of kidney injury were prerenal , hepatorenal syndrome<disease> ( HRS) and intrinsic tubular injury ( iAKI) in 39 patients ( 55.7 %) , 17 patients ( 24.3 %) and 14 patients ( 20 %) respectively. mean value of uNGAL in prerenal , HRS and iAKI was 21.70 ± 7.31 , 115.53 ± 68.19 and 240.83 ± 116.94 ng/mg creatinine respectively. MELD above 20 and uNGL above 32 were predictors of mortality. A single baseline measurement of uNGAL level has the ability to determine type of kidney dysfunction in cirrhotic patients , perhaps accelerating management decisions and improving outcomes.
