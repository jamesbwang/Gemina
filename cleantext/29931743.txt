  Solid oxide fuel cells ( SOFCs) represent the most efficient devices for producing electrical power from fuels. The limit in their application is due to the high operation temperature of conventional SOFC materials. Progress is made toward lower operating temperatures using alternative oxygen-ion conducting electrolytes , but problems of stability and electronic conductivity still remain. A promising alternative is the use of chemically stable proton-conducting Y-doped BaZrO
