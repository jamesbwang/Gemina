  In this paper , we propose a model for forecasting Value-at-Risk ( VaR) using a Bayesian Markov-switching GJR-GARCH ( 1,1) model with skewed Student 's- t innovation , copula functions and extreme value theory. A Bayesian Markov-switching GJR-GARCH ( 1,1) model that identifies non-constant volatility over time and allows the GARCH parameters to vary over time following a Markov process , is combined with copula functions and EVT to formulate the Bayesian Markov-switching GJR-GARCH ( 1,1) copula-EVT VaR model , which is then used to forecast the level of risk on financial asset returns. We further propose a new method for threshold selection in EVT analysis , which we term the hybrid method. Empirical and back-testing results show that the proposed VaR models capture VaR reasonably well in periods of calm and in periods of crisis.
