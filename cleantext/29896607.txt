  Two transition metal ( Co and Ni) ion phosphonates as isostructural organic inorganic hybrids are prepared and investigated in terms of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water and CO2 reduction under UV light irradiation. A photocatalytic mechanism of ligand-to-metal charge transfer ( LMCT) is proposed.
