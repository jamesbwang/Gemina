  Evidence suggests that the identification and response to the deteriorating patient continues to be an ongoing concern , despite the widespread use of track and trigger score ( TTS) systems. This article discusses the variations in the parameters included in the different TTS systems in use across the NHS and their sensitivity. Clinical guidelines and physiological theory are used to appraise the parameters allocated in the National Early Warning Score ( NEWS 1 and 2) , highlighting potential limitations of the tool. The findings lead to the conclusion that registered nurses should not rely solely on NEWS , but should use it to support their clinical judgement.
