  The current system of burn care delivery attempts to meet the needs of the nearly 500 000 patients in the United States who require medical treatment annually. However , specialization of care and lack of fundamental burn and wound care knowledge among graduating medical trainees has unintended consequences , leaving the system inefficient , with inherent inequities in care delivery and with the potential to be overwhelmed in a mass casualty event. While increasing accessibility to specialty burn centers through technology could mitigate some of these problems , increased education is more practical. The implementation of a formal wound<disease> care curriculum in medical school would address the problems associated with chronic<disease> wounds<disease> in the United States. Additionally , this curriculum would be a natural extension of exposure to the basics of burn care , a relevant skill set in any specialty.
