  EWS-FLI1 constitutes an oncogenic transcription factor that plays key roles in Ewing sarcoma<disease> development and maintenance. We have recently succeeded in generating an ex vivo mouse model for Ewing sarcoma<disease> by introducing EWS-FLI1 into embryonic osteochondrogenic progenitors. The model well recapitulates the biological characteristics , small round cell morphology , and gene expression profiles of human Ewing sarcoma<disease>. Here , we clarified the global DNA binding properties of EWS-FLI1 in mouse Ewing sarcoma<disease>. GGAA microsatellites were found to serve as binding sites of EWS-FLI1 albeit with less frequency than that in human Ewing sarcoma<disease>; moreover , genomic distribution was not conserved between human and mouse. Nevertheless , EWS-FLI1 binding sites within GGAA microsatellites were frequently associated with the histone H3K27Ac enhancer mark , suggesting that EWS-FLI1 could affect global gene expression by binding its target sites. In particular , the Fox transcription factor binding motif was frequently observed within EWS-FLI1 peaks and Foxq1 was identified as the cooperative partner that interacts with the EWS portion of EWS-FLI1. Trib1 and Nrg1 were demonstrated as target genes that are co-regulated by EWS-FLI1 and Foxq1 , and are important for cell proliferation and survival of Ewing sarcoma<disease>. Collectively , our findings present novel aspects of EWS-FLI1 function as well as the importance of GGAA microsatellites.
