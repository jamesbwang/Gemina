  Trihalomethanes ( THMs) and Haloacetic Acids ( HAAs) are the main groups detected in drinking water and are consequently strictly regulated. However , the increasing quantity of data for disinfection byproducts ( DBPs) produced from research projects and regulatory programs remains largely unexploited , despite a great potential for its use in optimizing drinking water quality monitoring to meet specific objectives. In this work , we developed a procedure to optimize locations and periods for DBPs monitoring based on a set of monitoring scenarios using the cluster analysis technique. The optimization procedure used a robust set of spatio-temporal monitoring results on DBPs ( THMs and HAAs) generated from intensive sampling campaigns conducted in a residential sector of a water distribution system. Results shows that cluster analysis allows for the classification of water quality in different groups of THMs and HAAs according to their similarities , and the identification of locations presenting water quality concerns. By using cluster analysis with different monitoring objectives , this work provides a set of monitoring solutions and a comparison between various monitoring scenarios for decision-making purposes. Finally , it was demonstrated that the data from intensive monitoring of free chlorine residual and water temperature as DBP proxy parameters , when processed using cluster analysis , could also help identify the optimal sampling points and periods for regulatory THMs and HAAs monitoring.
