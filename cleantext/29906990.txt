  Clique percolation has attracted much attention due to its significance in understanding topological overlap among communities and dynamical instability of structured systems. Rich critical behavior has been observed in clique percolation on Erdős-Rényi ( ER) random graphs , but few works have discussed clique percolation on finite dimensional systems. In this paper , we have defined a series of characteristic events , i.e. , the historically largest size jumps of the clusters , in the percolating process of adding bonds and developed a new finite-size scaling scheme based on the interval of the characteristic events. Through the finite-size scaling analysis , we have found , interestingly , that , in contrast to the clique percolation on an ER graph where the critical exponents are parameter dependent , the two-dimensional ( 2D) clique percolation simply shares the same critical exponents with traditional site or bond percolation , independent of the clique percolation parameters. This has been corroborated by bridging two special types of clique percolation to site percolation on 2D lattices. Mechanisms for the difference of the critical behaviors between clique percolation on ER graphs and on 2D lattices are also discussed.
