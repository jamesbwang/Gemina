  The efficacy of primary prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF) in preventing febrile neutropenia ( FN) in patients treated with docetaxel , cisplatin , and 5-fluorouracil ( TPF) chemotherapy remains controversial. We compared the incidence of FN in patients treated with and without primary prophylactic G-CSF. We performed a retrospective analysis of 142 patients with locally advanced head and neck or esophageal cancer treated with TPF between January 2009 and March 2017. Among them , 116 patients started TPF without primary prophylactic G-CSF ( control group) while 26 patients were given primary prophylactic G-CSF from day 7 of the first cycle of TPF ( prophylactic group). The incidence of grade 4 neutropenia during the first cycle of TPF was significantly higher in the control group than in the prophylactic group ( 58.6 % ( n = 68) vs. 30.8 % ( n = 8) , p = 0.02). However , the incidence of FN in the first cycle was not significantly different between the two groups ( 32 patients ( 27.5 %) in the control group and 8 patients ( 30.8 %) in the prophylactic group ( p = 0.62)). In addition , the mean relative dose intensity throughout all cycles of TPF , as well as the survival time and response after TPF , were also not significantly different between the two groups. Primary prophylactic G-CSF from day 7 of the first cycle of TPF did not reduce the incidence of FN. Our findings suggest that the timing of primary prophylactic G-CSF , as recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines , should be modified to reduce the incidence of FN in TPF.
