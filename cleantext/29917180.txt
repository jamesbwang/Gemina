  To study effects of microRNA-98 ( miR-98) on osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs). We predicted target gene of miR-98 with software test , and detected expression changes of miR-98 , as well as its target gene HMGA2 , in the process of osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. After transfection of miR-98 mimic and HMGA2 siRNA , we induced osteogenic differentiation and detected expression changes of osteogenic differentiation markers ( RUNX2 , ALP , OCN , and BSP). MiR-98 combined directly with target gene HMGA2 and inhibited its expression. During the process of osteogenic differentiation , expression of miR-98 was up-regulated , while HMGA2 expression was down-regulated. In addition , the expression of osteogenesis maker genes increased in cells being transfected with miR-98 mimics and HMGA2 siRNA. MiR-98 can promote osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells by targeting gene HMGA2.
