  Breast cancer screening using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) has limited accessibility due to high costs of breast MRI. Ultrafast dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI can be acquired within 2 minutes. We aimed to assess whether screening performance of breast radiologist using an ultrafast breast MRI-only screening protocol is as good as performance using a full multiparametric diagnostic MRI protocol ( FDP). The institutional review board approved this study , and waived the need for informed consent. Between January 2012 and June 2014 , 1791 consecutive breast cancer screening examinations from 954 women with a lifetime risk of more than 20 % were prospectively collected. All women were scanned using a 3 T protocol interleaving ultrafast breast MRI acquisitions in a full multiparametric diagnostic MRI protocol consisting of standard dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences , diffusion-weighted imaging , and T2-weighted imaging. Subsequently , a case set was created including all biopsied screen-detected lesions<symptom> in this period ( 31 malignant and 54 benign) and 116 randomly selected normal cases with more than 2 years of follow-up. Prior examinations were included when available. Seven dedicated breast radiologists read all 201 examinations and 153 available priors once using the FDP and once using ultrafast breast MRI only in 2 counterbalanced and crossed-over reading sessions. For reading the FDP versus ultrafast breast MRI alone , sensitivity was 0.86 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.81-0.90) versus 0.84 ( 95 % CI , 0.78-0.88) ( P = 0.50) , specificity was 0.76 ( 95 % CI , 0.74-0.79) versus 0.82 ( 95 % CI , 0.79-0.84) ( P = 0.002) , positive predictive value was 0.40 ( 95 % CI , 0.36-0.45) versus 0.45 ( 95 % CI , 0.41-0.50) ( P = 0.14) , and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.89 ( 95 % CI , 0.82-0.96) versus 0.89 ( 95 % CI , 0.82-0.96) ( P = 0.83). Ultrafast breast MRI reading was 22.8 % faster than reading FDP ( P < 0.001). Interreader agreement is significantly better for ultrafast breast MRI ( κ = 0.730; 95 % CI , 0.699-0.761) than for the FDP ( κ = 0.665; 95 % CI , 0.633-0.696). Breast MRI screening using only an ultrafast breast MRI protocol is noninferior to screening with an FDP and may result in significantly higher screening specificity and shorter reading time.
