  Xenopus gastrulation movements are in large part based on the rearrangement of cells by differential cell-on-cell migration within multilayered tissues. Different patterns of migration-based cell intercalation drive endoderm and mesoderm internalization and their positioning along their prospective body axes. C-cadherin , fibronectin , integrins , and focal contact components are expressed in all gastrula cells and play putative roles in cell-on-cell migration , but their actual functions in this respect are not yet understood. The gastrula can be subdivided into two motility domains , and in the vegetal , migratory domain , two modes of cell migration are discerned. Vegetal endoderm cells show ingression-type migration , a variant of amoeboid migration characterized by the lack of locomotory protrusions and by macropinocytosis as a mechanism of trailing edge resorption. Mesendoderm and prechordal mesoderm cells use lamellipodia in a mesenchymal mode of migration. Gastrula cell motility can be dissected into traits , such as cell polarity , adhesion , mobility , or protrusive activity , which are controlled separately yet in complex , combinatorial ways. Cells can instantaneously switch between different combinations of traits , showing plasticity as they respond to substratum properties.
