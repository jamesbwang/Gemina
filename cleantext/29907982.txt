  Simultaneous analysis of multiple genes using next-generation sequencing ( NGS) technology has become widely available. Copy-number variations ( CNVs) in disease-associated genes have emerged as a cause for several hereditary disorders. CNVs are , however , not routinely detected using NGS analysis. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic yield and the prevalence of CNVs using our panel of Hereditary Thoracic Aortic Disease ( H-TAD)- associated genes. Eight hundred ten patients suspected of H-TAD were analyzed by targeted NGS analysis of 21 H-TAD associated genes. In addition , the eXome hidden Markov model ( XHMM; an algorithm to identify CNVs in targeted NGS data) was used to detect CNVs in these genes. A pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was found in 66 of 810 patients ( 8.1 %). Of these 66 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants , six ( 9.1 %) were CNVs not detectable by routine NGS analysis. These CNVs were four intragenic ( multi-) exon deletions in MYLK , TGFB2 , SMAD3 , and PRKG1 , respectively. In addition , a large duplication including NOTCH1 and a large deletion encompassing SCARF2 were detected. As confirmed by additional analyses , both CNVs indicated larger chromosomal abnormalities , which could explain the phenotype in both patients. Given the clinical relevance of the identification of a genetic cause , CNV analysis using a method such as XHMM should be incorporated into the clinical diagnostic care for H-TAD patients.
