  Fourier domain structured low-rank matrix priors are emerging as powerful alternatives to traditional image recovery methods such as total variation ( TV) and wavelet regularization. These priors specify that a convolutional structured matrix , i.e. , Toeplitz , Hankel , or their multi-level generalizations , built from Fourier data of the image should be low-rank. The main challenge in applying these schemes to large-scale problems is the computational complexity and memory demand resulting from a lifting the image data to a large scale matrix. We introduce a fast and memory efficient approach called the Generic Iterative Reweighted Annihilation Filter ( GIRAF) algorithm that exploits the convolutional structure of the lifted matrix to work in the original un-lifted domain , thus considerably reducing the complexity. Our experiments on the recovery of images from undersampled Fourier measurements show that the resulting algorithm is considerably faster than previously proposed algorithms , and can accommodate much larger problem sizes than previously studied.
