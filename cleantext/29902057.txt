  Older adults have poor recognition of isolated facial expressions , yet outside the lab , such faces are typically perceived with contextual expressive bodies. In fact , recent work suggests that real-life facial expressions may be ambiguous while contextual information such as body language may be more diagnostic for decoding emotions. We examined the recognition of emotion from incongruent face-body composites and found that compared to young adults , older adults gave the body far more weight when recognizing emotion. These results are consistent with a social-expertise view and suggest that in real-life , older adults may employ an advantageous holistic approach to emotion perception. ( PsycINFO Database Record
