  Besides the use as cold matrix for spectroscopic studies , superfluid helium droplets have served as a cold environment for the synthesis of molecules and clusters. Since vibrational frequencies of molecules in helium droplets exhibit almost no shift compared to the free molecule values , one could assume the solvated particles move frictionless and undergo a reaction as soon as their paths cross. There have been a few unexplained observations that seemed to indicate cases of two species on one droplet not forming bonds but remaining isolated. In this work , we performed a systematic study of helium droplets doped with one rubidium and one strontium atom showing that besides a reaction to RbSr , there is a probability of finding separated Rb and Sr atoms on one droplet that only react after electronic excitation. Our results further indicate that ground-state Sr atoms can reside at the surface as well as inside the droplet.
