  A common technique to regain stability following an unexpected perturbation is reactive stepping , aimed to control the accelerated center of mass ( COM). Many older adults ( OA) struggle to execute the fast , coordinated stepping strategy required to arrest COM movement within the base of support ( BOS) during these unexpected events , likely due to age-related physiological declines. Recent ecological data also suggests that many falls in OA occur due to errors in transferring or shifting body<symptom> weight during activities of daily living. The present study utilized gait initiation , which requires a coordinated transition from quiet stance to dynamic gait , as an example of one of these difficult transitional movements. Our goal was to combine this inherently unstable task , gait initiation , with an unexpected mediolateral ( ML) perturbation of the support surface to examine age-related changes in reactive stepping patterns during a novel transitional gait task. A total of 18 young adults ( YA) and 16 OA ( > 65 years) performed 35 trials containing 10 unexpected ML perturbations of the support surface. To quantify age-related differences , we calculated step width , length , time and COM velocity in the first two steps following the perturbation. We observed that , in general , OA walked slower and took shorter , faster steps ( reducing time in single support) compared to YA. Following the perturbation , OA altered their stepping patterns by reducing their BOS ( more narrow step width compared to YA) , and required more than the two steps used by YA to complete the goal-directed task. These age-related changes are concerning as a multi-step recovery strategy has been previously associated with an elevated risk of falls in OA.
