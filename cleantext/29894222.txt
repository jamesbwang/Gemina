  The purposes of this study were to develop an automated process for radiologists to obtain clinical follow-up on radiology reports via HIPAA-compliant e-mail and to determine what follow-up data were collected and whether they were relevant to the radiology reports. The algorithm generated high-yield follow-up data for radiologists that may improve patient care by facilitating radiologist engagement and self-assessment.
