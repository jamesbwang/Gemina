  To investigate the role of night work in prostate cancer based on data from the EPICAP Study. EPICAP is a French population-based case-control study including 818 incident prostate cancer cases and 875 frequency-matched controls that have been interviewed face to face on several potential risk factors including lifetime occupational history. Detailed information on work schedules for each job ( permanent or rotating night work , duration , total number of nights<symptom> , length of the shift , number of consecutive nights<symptom>) as well as sleep duration and chronotype , was gathered. Prostate cancer aggressiveness was assessed by Gleason Score. Night work was not associated with prostate cancer , whatever the aggressiveness of prostate cancer , while we observed an overall increased risk among men with an evening chronotype ( OR = 1.83 , 95 % CI 1.05 to 3.19). A long duration of at least 20 years of permanent night work was associated with aggressive prostate cancer ( OR = 1.76 , 95 % CI 1.13 to 2.75) , even more pronounced in combination with a shift length > 10 hours or â‰¥ 6 consecutive nights<symptom> ( OR = 4.64 , 95 % CI 1.78 to 12.13; OR = 2.43 , 95 % CI 1.32 to 4.47 , respectively). Overall , ever night work , either permanent or rotating , was not associated to prostate cancer. Nevertheless , our results suggest that a long duration of permanent night work in combination with a long shift length or at least six consecutive nights<symptom> may be associated with prostate cancer , particularly with aggressive prostate cancer. Further studies are needed to confirm those findings.
