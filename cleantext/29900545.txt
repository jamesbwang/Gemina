  This manuscript provides a critical review of the literature on parent-child physiological synchrony-the matching of biological states between parents and children. All eligible studies found some evidence of physiological synchrony , though the magnitude and direction of synchrony varied according to methodological factors , including the physiological system examined ( i.e. , parasympathetic or sympathetic nervous system activity , adrenocortical functioning) and the statistical approach used ( e.g. , multilevel modeling , correlation). The review underscores the need to consider the context in which physiological synchrony occurs ( e.g. , family risk) to best understand its significance. Furthermore , the review delineates vital avenues for future research , including the need to assess synchrony across multiple physiological systems and the importance of documenting continuity/change in physiological synchrony across developmental periods. Such research is crucial for understanding how the parent-child relationship unfolds at a physiological level and , in turn , how this relationship can facilitate or hinder parent , child , and family adjustment.
