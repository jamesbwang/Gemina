  The remarkable effect of divalent transition metal ions on the electrochemical performance of transition metal-based layered double hydroxides ( LDHs) was systematically investigated via computational and experimental approaches. Ni3-xCoxAl-LDHs ( x = 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3) were synthesized on carbon paper by a unipolar pulse electrodeposition ( UPED) method and used as electrodes in energy storage systems. The structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction ( XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS). Their electrochemical performance was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry ( CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS). The mechanism of different electrochemical performances with various divalent transition metal ions was investigated by the density functional theory ( DFT) plus U method and molecular dynamics ( MD) simulations. The computational and experimental data demonstrated that the electronic and ionic conductivity and deprotonation of NiAl-LDHs were improved by doping Co species , and the incorporation of Co and Ni cations enabled LDHs to exhibit a larger interlayer spacing which can facilitate the diffusion of OH- ions , indicating that NiCo2Al-LDHs had the highest specific capacitance.
