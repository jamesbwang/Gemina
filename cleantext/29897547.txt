  The current study was carried out to investigate the consequences of mannan-oligosaccharides ( MOS) , a prebiotic , as feed supplement on biochemical parameters of Japanese quail breeders ( Coturnix coturnix japonica<pathogen>). Twelve-week-old , 960 birds , belonging to 4 close-bred flocks ( CBF) , were randomly selected and divided into 4 treatment groups with 3 replicates according to pattern ( 4 strains × 4 treatment groups × 3 replicates). Birds were fed corn-based basal diet or the same diet supplemented with 0.25 , 0.50 , and 1.0 % MOS for 15 wk. After termination of the experimental trial , samples of blood were taken from randomly selected 3 birds/replicate ( 1 ♂ and 2 ♀) and processed for serologic analysis. The statistical analysis was performed by applying 2-way analysis of variance. The serum concentrations of total proteins , globulin , high-density lipoprotein , and tri-iodothyronine ( T3) of Japanese quail breeders were significantly ( P < 0.05) higher in MOS-supplemented groups than that of control group; however , triglycerides were decreased significantly ( P < 0.05) by MOS supplementation in female birds. Estrogen level in male birds was significantly ( P < 0.05) different; however , non-significant differences were recorded in thyroxine ( T4) , progesterone , alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase , glucose , albumin , cholesterol , and low-density lipoprotein concentrations in all feeding groups. The significant differences in biochemical parameters by feeding MOS-supplemented diets strengthened our hypothesis that the use of MOS may positively affect the health of Japanese quail breeders.
