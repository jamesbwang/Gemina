  We describe two novel myxosporean parasites from Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii , an economically important freshwater catfish from the Amazon basin , Brazil. Myxobolus tapajosi n. sp. , was found in the gill filaments of 23.5 % of 17 fish , with myxospores round to oval in frontal view and biconvex in lateral view: length 15 ( 13.5-17) μm and width 10.7 ( 9.6-11.4) μm; polar capsules equal , length 5.8 ( 4.6-7.1) μm and width 3 ( 2.3-3.8) μm containing polar tubules with 6-7 turns. Ellipsomyxa amazonensis n. sp. myxospores were found floating freely or inside plasmodia in the gall bladder of 23.5 % of fish. The myxospores were ellipsoidal with rounded extremities: length 12.8 ( 12.3-13.6) μm and width 7.6 ( 6.7-8.7) μm; with two equal , slightly pyriform polar capsules , length 3.8 ( 3.8-4.0) μm and width 3.1 ( 2.5-3.4) μm , containing polar tubules with 2-3 turns. We combined spore morphometry , small-subunit ribosomal DNA data , specific host , and phylogenetic analyses , to identify both of these parasites as new myxozoan species. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses showed that Myxobolus tapajosi n. sp. clustered in a basal branch in a subclade of parasites from exclusively South American pimelodid fishes. Ellipsomyxa amazonensis n. sp. clustered within the marine Ellipsomyxa lineage , but we suspect that although the parasite was collected in freshwater , its hosts perform a large migration throughout the Amazon basin and may have become infected from a brackish/marine polychaete host during the estuary phase of its life.
