  Rabbits are valuable experimental animals used to evaluate the teratogenicity of chemical entities. If teratogenicity is recognized , it is very important to investigate the pathogenesis to assess the potential risk in humans. For this investigation , whole-mount in situ hybridization ( WISH) is highly useful for visualizing spatial and temporal changes in the expression patterns of the targeted genes and or proteins. In this chapter , the WISH method in rabbit embryos , using a digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe , and the morphometric analysis of the expression pattern is described.
