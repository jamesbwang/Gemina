  The loss of independent joint control , clinically referred to as limb synergies , is prevalent in the paretic upper limb of individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke. To understand the underlying neural mechanisms , we previously reported that an increased overlap of cortical representations of shoulder/elbow could contribute to the abnormal poststroke synergies. However , these previous results were limited to a fixed time window just before the onset of motor tasks. Questions such as ( 1) how this overlap develops during motor preparation and ( 2) whether such development is also linked to upper limb synergies , remain unclear. To answer these questions , we investigated cortical overlap during motor preparation of isometric shoulder and elbow torque generation tasks in healthy individuals ( n = 8) , and individuals with moderate to severe chronic hemiparesis<symptom> following a subcortical stroke ( n = 12). We found a significant group difference in how the cortical overlap developed. In the healthy control and moderately impaired stroke groups , cortical overlap between shoulder and elbow motor tasks decreased during the motor preparation; however , this overlap increased in individuals with severe stroke. Furthermore , the rate of cortical overlap decrease/increase was linked to the upper limb Fugl-Meyer scores and limb synergies. These results demonstrate , for the first time , that the increase in overlap of the cortical activity during motor preparation is associated with the expression of synergies in the paretic upper limb of severely impaired poststroke individuals.
