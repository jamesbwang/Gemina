  Over the last decades , much effort has been devoted to the design of the `` ideal '' library for screening , the most promising strategies being those which draw inspiration from biogenic compounds , as the aim is to add biological relevance to such libraries. On the other hand , there is a growing understanding of the role that molecular complexity plays in the discovery of new bioactive small molecules. Nevertheless , the introduction of molecular complexity must be balanced with synthetic accessibility. In this work , we show that both concepts can be efficiently merged-in a minimalist way-by using very simple guidelines during the design process along with the application of multicomponent reactions as key steps in the synthetic process. Natural phenanthrenoids , a class of plant aromatic metabolites , served as inspiration for the synthesis of a library in which complexity-enhancing features were introduced in few steps using multicomponent reactions. These resulting chemical entities were not only more complex than the parent natural products , but also interrogated an alternative region of the chemical space , which led to an outstanding hit rate in an antiproliferative assay: four out of twenty-six compounds showed in vitro activity , one of them being more potent than the clinically useful drug 5-fluorouracil.
