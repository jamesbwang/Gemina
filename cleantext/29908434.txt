  To longitudinally assess individuals using quantified measures , we must characterize within-subject variability ( WSV) of the measures. What is the natural within-subject variability ( WSV) that can be expected in postural control over 3 + days? Thirteen individuals without orthopedic or neurologic impairment ( mean ( SD) = 55 ( 9) years; 76 ( 18) kg; 11 females/2 males) were recruited from a community workplace and consented to participate. Participants stood quietly with eyes closed ( QEC) on a force platform ( 5 x 1 min x 6 days) in two stances: comfortable and narrow. We recorded center of pressure ( COP) and calculated COP-based balance<symptom> parameters. To analyze variance components , we applied a linear mixed model for repeated measures , calculating within-subject standard deviation ( SDws) from the pooled variance not attributable to between-subject variability. To estimate WSV , we scaled SDws by a confidence interval ( CI) factor ( e.g. WSV at the 95 % CI = WSV WSV This work advances longitudinal assessment of individuals using quantified measures of postural control. Results enable practitioners/researchers to assess an individual 's progress , maintenance , or decline relative to WSV at a defined CI level.
