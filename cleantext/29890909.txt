  Dual mobility ( DM) total hip arthroplasty ( THA) may reduce dislocation risk , but might increase the risk of high polyethylene ( PE) wear due to double wearing surfaces. 127 patients ( 97 female) with 129 hips operated with THA after displaced femoral neck fracture FNF between 2005 and 2011 , were seen for a cross-sectional clinical follow-up. Acetabular components were Saturne Â® DM cups with 28 mm chrome-cobalt heads in UHMWPE. Cementless cups ( n = 73) were hydroxyapatite coated. Radiographs were obtained for analysis of cup placement , 2D polyethylene wear and wear-rate ( PolyWare 3D) , and further radiological evaluation. Activity measurements included Timed Up and Go test ( TUG) and walking distance from Harris Hip Score ( HHS). At a mean follow-up of 2.83 ( 1.0-7.7) years the mean wear was 0.82 mm ( range 0.17-4.51 , SD 0.50) , and the wear-rate was 0.37 mm ( range 0.06-1.90 , SD 0.29). Wear-rate of 0.43 mm/year ( SD 0.30) in cementless cups was higher ( p = 0.004) than 0.30 mm/year ( SD 0.27) in cemented cups. Mean age at time of surgery was 75.1 years ( range 30-95). There was no correlation between age at time of surgery and wear ( p = 0.56). There was no correlation between cup inclination and wear-rate ( p = 0.35). TUG was mean 13.4 seconds ( range 4.5-30.1) and correlated with wear rate ( p = 0.03). At short term follow-up , the mean wear-rate in old and low demand patients was high , correlated to activity , and was above the generally accepted osteolysis threshold ( 0.1 mm/yr.). Cementless HA-coated cups had higher wear-rate than cemented cups.
