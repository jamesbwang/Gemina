  Mechanical perturbations are ubiquitous in living cells , and many biological functions are dependent on the mechanical response of lipid membranes<symptom>. Recent force-spectroscopy studies have captured the stepwise fracture of stacks of bilayers , avoiding substrate effects. However , the effect of stacking bilayers , as well as the exact molecular mechanism of the fracture process , is unknown. Here , we use atomistic and coarse-grained force-clamp molecular dynamics simulation to assess the effects of mechanical indentation on stacked and single bilayers. Our simulations show that the rupture process obeys the laws of force-activated barrier crossing , and stacking multiple membranes<symptom> stabilizes them. The rupture times follow a log-normal distribution which allows the interpretation of membrane rupture as a pore-growth process. Indenter hydrophobicity determines the type of pore formation , the preferred dwelling region , and the resistance of the bilayer against rupture. Our results provide a better understanding of the nanomechanics underlying the plastic rupture of lipid
