  Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> drug resistance poses a major threat to tuberculosis<pathogen> control. Current phenotypic tests for drug susceptibility are time-consuming , technically complex , and expensive. Whole genome sequencing is a promising alternative , though the impact of different drug resistance mutations on the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC) remains to be investigated. We examined the genomes of 72 phenotypically drug-resistant Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> isolates from 72 Romanian patients for drug resistance mutations. MICs for first- and second-line drugs were determined using the MycoTB microdilution method. These MICs were compared to macrodilution critical concentration testing by the Mycobacterium<pathogen> Growth Indicator Tube ( MGIT) platform and correlated to drug resistance mutations. Sixty-three ( 87.5 %) isolates harboured drug resistance mutations; 48 ( 66.7 %) were genotypically multidrug-resistant. Different drug resistance mutations were associated with different MIC ranges; katG S315T for isoniazid , and rpoB S450L for rifampicin were associated with high MICs. However , several mutations such as in rpoB , rrs and rpsL , or embB were associated with MIC ranges including the critical concentration for rifampicin , aminoglycosides or ethambutol , respectively. Different resistance mutations lead to distinct MICs , some of which may still be overcome by increased dosing. Whole genome sequencing can aid in the timely diagnosis of Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> drug resistance and guide clinical decision-making.
