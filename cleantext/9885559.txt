  Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> displays a variety of morphological forms , and the ability to switch forms must be linked with cell cycle control. In budding yeast the Mitotic Exit Network ( MEN) acts to drive mitotic exit and signal for cytokinesis and cell separation. However , previous reports on the MEN in C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> have raised questions on its role in this organism , with the components analysed to date demonstrating differing levels of importance in the processes of mitotic exit , cytokinesis and cell separation. This work focuses on the role of the Cdc15 kinase in C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> and demonstrates that , similar to Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> , it plays an essential role in signalling for mitotic exit and cytokinesis. Cells depleted of Cdc15 developed into elongated filaments , a common response to cell cycle arrest in C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen>. These filaments emerged exclusively from large budded cells , contained two nuclear bodies and exhibited a hyper-extended spindle , all characteristic of these cells failing to exit mitosis. Furthermore these filaments displayed a clear cytokinesis defect , and CDC15 over-expression led to aberrant cell separation following hyphal morphogenesis. Together , these results are consistent with Cdc15 playing an essential role in signalling for mitotic exit , cytokinesis and cell separation in
