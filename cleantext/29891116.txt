  Cancer cachexia is a multi-factorial syndrome<disease> , which negatively affects quality of life , responsiveness to chemotherapy , and survival in advanced cancer patients. Our understanding of cachexia has grown greatly in recent years and the roles of many tumor-derived and host-derived compounds have been elucidated as mediators of cancer cachexia. However , cancer cachexia remains an unmet medical need and attempts towards a standard treatment guideline have been unsuccessful. This review covers the diagnosis , assessment , and treatment of cancer cachexia; the elements impeding the formulation of a standard management guideline; and future directions of research for the improvement and standardization of current treatment procedures.
