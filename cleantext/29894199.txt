  Experiments have shown that relaxation of oil/water interfacial tension by adsorption of alkyl ethoxylate surfactants from water onto an oil droplet is delayed relative to diffusion-controlled adsorption. We examine possible causes of this delay , and we show that several are implausible. We find that re-dissolution of the surfactant in the oil droplet can not explain the apparent interfacial resistance at short times , because the interface will preferentially fill before any such re-dissolution occurs. We also perform umbrella sampling with molecular dynamics simulation and do not find any evidence of a free energy barrier or low-diffusivity zone near the interface. Nor do we find evidence from simulation that pre-micellar aggregation slows diffusion enough to cause the observed resistance to interfacial adsorption. We are therefore unable to pinpoint the cause of the resistance , but we suggest that `` dead time '' associated with the experimental method could be responsible- specifically a local depletion of surfactant by the ejected droplet when creating the fresh interface between the oil and water.
