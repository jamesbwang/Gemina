  Protein thermal shift assays ( TSAs) provide a means for characterizing target engagement through ligand-induced thermal stabilization. Although these assays are widely utilized for screening libraries and validating hits in drug discovery programs , they can impose encumbering operational requirements , such as the availability of purified proteins or selective antibodies. Appending the target protein with a small luciferase ( NanoLuc) allows coupling of thermal denaturation with luminescent output , providing a rapid and sensitive means for assessing target engagement in compositionally complex environments such as permeabilized cells. The intrinsic thermal stability of NanoLuc is greater than mammalian proteins , and our results indicate that the appended luciferase does not alter thermal denaturation of the target protein. We have successfully applied the NanoLuc luciferase thermal shift assay ( NaLTSA) to several clinically relevant protein families , including kinases , bromodomains , and histone deacetylases. We have also demonstrated the suitability of this assay method for library screening and compound profiling.
