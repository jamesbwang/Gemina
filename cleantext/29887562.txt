  Herein , we determined the contents of Cu ( I) , Cu ( II) , and hydrophobic Cu in natural water using on-site sample treatment , solid-phase extraction ( SPE) , and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS) analysis. To prevent Cu species changes in the sampling , filtering and preconditioning steps were performed in a closed system using plastic syringes and a disposable membrane filter. Bathocuproin disulfonate ( BCS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA) were selected as a Cu ( I)- selective complexing agent and a Cu ( II) masking agent , respectively , whereas ascorbic acid ( AA) was used to reduce Cu ( II) to Cu ( I). Pre-conditioned samples were passed through a hydrophobic SPE column , and the retained Cu species were eluted with ethanol. Subsequently , the eluate was concentrated , and the residue was re-dissolved in 2 M HNO
