  To explore the role of fatty acid binding protein 4 ( FABP4) in regulating lung cancer cell metastasis and identify miRNAs that target FABP4. The expression of FABP4 in lung cancer cells with different metastatic potentials was detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) and Western blotting. The effects of FABP4 knockdown or overexpression by shRNA or a recombinant lentivirus , respectively , on lung cancer cells metastasis were assessed. The miRNAs that targeted FABP4 were screened using target prediction algorithms and the results were verified with Q-PCR. FABP4 expression was significantly higher in lung cancer cell lines with high metastatic potentials ( NL9980 , H661 , and 95C) than in those with low metastatic potentials ( L9981 , A549 , and PC13) ( P < 0.05). FABP4 knockdown in NL9980 cells resulted in significantly inhibited metastasis of the cells ( P < 0.05) , while FABP4 overexpression obviously promoted the metastasis of A549 cells ( P < 0.05). The expressions of miR-203 , miR-361 and miR-539 were significantly higher in highly metastatic lung cancer cells than in the cells with low metastatic potentials ( P < 0.05). In NL9980 cells , FABP4 expression was most obviously suppressed by miR-203 ( P < 0.05) , and target site mutational FABP4 overexpression significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of miR-203 on NL9980 metastasis ( P < 0.05). FABP4 can promote lung cancer metastasis , and by targeting FABP4 to inhibit its expression , miR-203 can suppress the metastasis of lung cancer cells.
