  Femoral derotation osteotomy ( FDO) is generally reported to be excellent for correcting the hip rotation and foot progression angles in children with cerebral palsy ( CP). However , it is unclear how long the favorable outcomes are maintained. This study was performed to evaluate the long-term outcomes at more than 10 years after FDO in children with CP. FDO , as part of single event multilevel surgery to improve gait function , was performed at the intertrochanteric level with the patient in the prone position. The goal of the index surgery was femoral anteversion of 15 ° , measured using a modified trochanteric prominence angle test intraoperatively. All patients underwent three-dimensional gait analysis preoperatively and at 1 year and over 10 years postoperatively. Thirty-four ambulatory patients ( 53 hips) with CP undergoing FDO were included. The mean age at surgery was 7.8 years ( SD = 3.0 years) and mean follow-up duration was 12.9 years ( SD = 2.7 years). The mean hip rotation decreased significantly from 9.6 ° preoperatively to 3.1 ° at 1 year postoperatively ( p = 0.004) , and decreased significantly to -5.9 ° at the final follow-up ( p < 0.001). The mean foot progression in stance decreased from 7.9 ° preoperatively to -7.4 ° at 1 year postoperatively ( p < 0.001) , and was maintained at -10.9 ° at the final follow-up. The GDI significantly improved from 68.2 preoperatively to 83.4 1 year postoperatively ( p < 0.001) , and was maintained at 82.3 at the final follow-up. No patients underwent revision surgery due to recurrence of rotation deformity. Proximal FDO performed in the prone position provides favorable long-term outcomes at more than 10 years postoperatively , without recurrence of rotation deformity. To avoid under-correction or recurrence due to insufficient derotation , surgeons should consider not only dynamic gait analysis findings but also the measurement of anatomic femoral anteversion during intraoperative derotation.
