  Transwomen of color are disproportionately impacted by HIV<pathogen> and may have worse health outcomes than other populations. This analysis was conducted to examine structural factors associated with poor health outcomes among transwomen of color living with HIV<pathogen> in the San Francisco Bay Area ( N = 159). Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to determine if structural factors were associated with poor HIV-related health outcomes. A majority of participants were Black or African American ( 110/159 , 69.2 %) , 32 ( 20.1 %) identified their primary race/ethnicity as Hispanic or Latino/a or Spanish , and 17 ( 10.7 %) identified as another race/ethnicity. Transwomen of color in our sample faced extreme structural barriers , including residential transience , extreme low income , high prevalence of running out of money in the last six months , high rates of food insecurity , high prevalence of income via entitlement programs , engagement in sex work and other illicit activities for income. Unstable housing was the structural factor most consistently associated with poor health outcomes along the HIV<pathogen> care continuum and may explain engagement in other sources of income generation. Interventions are needed that go beyond the individual and health care-level to address needs for housing and economic opportunities to improve HIV<pathogen> care outcomes among transwomen of color living with HIV<pathogen> in the San Francisco Bay Area.
