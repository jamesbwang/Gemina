  LLC-PK1 cells , an immortalized epithelial cell line derived from pig renal proximal tubules , express all the major players of the endocannabinoid system ( ECS) such as CB1 , CB2 and TRPV1 receptors , as well as the main enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of the major endocannabinoids named 2-arachidonoylglycerol , 2-AG and anandamide , AEA. Here we investigated whether the damages caused by ischemic insults either in vitro using LLC-PK1 cells exposed to antimycin A ( an inductor of ATP-depletion) or in vivo using Wistar rats in a classic renal ischemia and reperfusion ( IR) protocol , lead to changes in AEA and 2-AG levels , as well as altered expression of genes from the main enzymes involved in the regulation of the ECS. Our data show that the mRNA levels of the CB1 receptor gene were downregulated , while the transcript levels of monoacylglycerol lipase ( MAGL) , the main 2-AG degradative enzyme , were upregulated in LLC-PK1 cells after IR model. Accordingly , IR was accompanied by a significant reduction in the levels of 2-AG and AEA , as well as of the two endocannabinoid related molecules , oleoylethanolamide ( OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide ( PEA) in LLC-PK1 cells. In kidney cortex homogenates , only AEA levels were significantly decreased. In addition , we found that in both the in vitro and in vivo model IR caused a reduction in the expression and activity of the Na
