  In the United States , an estimated 20 million people , or 15 % of the population , are currently infected with human papilloma virus ( HPV). The prevalence of HPV is increasing in females aged 14 to 24 years. Assessing allied health students ' knowledge , attitudes , and behaviors regarding HPV was performed using a 34-question survey. The survey was in four sections: general information , measuring knowledge of HPV and the vaccine , HPV vaccine , and HPV screening and diagnosis. Physicians were noted by 31.6 % of the participants as the first individual who gave them information about HPV. There were 46.4 % of the participants who stated that HPV education came from a school nurse. Nurses play a critical role in educating young people about the benefits of the HPV vaccine.
