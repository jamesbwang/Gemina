  Previous studies have shown that voters rely on sexually dimorphic traits that signal masculinity and dominance when they choose political leaders. For example , voters exert strong preferences for candidates with lower pitched voices because these candidates are perceived as stronger and more competent. Moreover , experimental studies demonstrate that conservative voters , more than liberals , prefer political candidates with traits that signal dominance , probably because conservatives are more likely to perceive the world as a threatening place and to be more attentive to dangerous and threatening contexts. In light of these findings , this study investigates whether country-level ideology influences the relationship between candidate voice pitch and electoral outcomes of real elections. Specifically , we collected voice pitch data for presidential and prime minister candidates , aggregate national ideology for the countries in which the candidates were nominated , and measures of electoral outcomes for 69 elections held across the world. In line with previous studies , we found that candidates with lower pitched voices received more votes and had greater likelihood of winning the elections. Furthermore , regression analysis revealed an interaction between candidate voice pitch , national ideology , and election type ( presidential or parliamentary). That is , having a lower pitched voice was a particularly valuable asset for presidential candidates in conservative and right-leaning countries ( in comparison to presidential candidates in liberal and left-leaning countries and parliamentary elections). We discuss the practical implications of these findings , and how they relate to existing research on candidates ' voices , voting preferences , and democratic elections in general.
