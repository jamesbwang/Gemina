  Both the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system are critically involved in hypertension development. Although angiotensin II ( Ang II) stimulates hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus ( PVN) neurons to increase sympathetic vasomotor tone , the molecular mechanism mediating this action remains unclear. The glutamate NMDAR in the PVN controls sympathetic outflow in hypertension. In this study , we determined the interaction between α2δ-1 ( encoded by
