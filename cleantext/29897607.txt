  To analyze the frequency of use of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA) as a cognitive screening instrument , cross-cultural adaptation , the existence of normative data and clinical validation studies in Latin America Hispanic countries. The Medline , PsycINFO , Web of Science , Scopus and Scielo databases were consulted between April and June 2017 according to the PRISMA methodology. We included all studies referencing the MoCA as an instrument to evaluate cognitive deterioration conducted in Latin America and that included normative and psychometric data , as well as its clinical validation. Of the 80 studies identified , 19 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies mentioned the use of the Spanish version of the MoCA and reported a statistically significant effect of gender , age and , most of all , education on the performance of this test. Only five studies presented with a detailed analysis of the psychometric characteristics of the test , and in most articles cut-off scores for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment were the same as the original study. The small number of articles identified may reflect a late start of the use of MoCA in Latin America. A tendency towards the use of this test without making a cross-cultural adaptation and the use of international norms was observed in this region. The present systematic review demonstrates the need for future research tackling the development of a linguistically adapted version of the MoCA to Latin America and the study of its psychometric properties , with the aim of improving cognitive assessment.
