  The triglyceride ( TG)- to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) ratio ( TG/HDL-C) is a simple approach to predicting unfavorable outcomes in cardiovascular disease. The influence of TG/HDL-C on acute ischemic stroke remains elusive. The purpose of this study was to investigate the precise effect of TG/HDL-C on 3-month mortality after acute ischemic stroke ( AIS). Patients with AIS were enrolled in the present study from 2011 to 2017. A total of 1459 participants from a single city in China were divided into retrospective training and prospective test cohorts. Medical records were collected periodically to determine the incidence of fatal events. All participants were followed for 3 months. Optimal cutoff values were determined using X-tile software to separate the training cohort patients into higher and lower survival groups based on their lipid levels. A survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves and a Cox proportional hazards regression model. A total of 1459 patients with AIS ( median age 68.5 years , 58.5 % male) were analyzed. Univariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that TG/HDL-C was a significant prognostic factor for 3-month survival. X-tile identified 0.9 as an optimal cutoff for TG/HDL-C. In the univariate analysis , the prognosis of the TG/HDL-C > 0.9 group was markedly superior to that of TG/HDL-C â‰¤ 0.9 group ( P < 0.001). A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that TG/HDL-C was independently correlated with a reduced risk of mortality ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 0.39; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.24-0.62; P < 0.001). These results were confirmed in the 453 patients in the test cohort. A nomogram was constructed to predict 3-month case-fatality , and the c-indexes of predictive accuracy were 0.684 and 0.670 in the training and test cohorts , respectively ( P < 0.01). The serum TG/HDL-C ratio may be useful for predicting short-term mortality after AIS.
