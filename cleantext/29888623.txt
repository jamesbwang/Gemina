  Although undernutrition and sarcopenia are common among older adults and both result in worse health outcomes , data concerning the burden of these conditions in Portuguese community-dwelling older adults are scarce. The aim of this study was to firstly describe the occurrence of sarcopenia and undernutrition among a nationwide community-dwelling sample of older adults. Using a cross-sectional analysis , 1493 Portuguese older adults age â‰¥ 65 years from the Nutrition UP 65 study were evaluated. Sarcopenia was defined according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People , and undernutrition status was evaluated by Mini-Nutritional Assessment-Short Form. Sarcopenia frequency was 11.6 % , and of these , 4.4 % were classified with severe sarcopenia. Furthermore , 0.8 % presented sarcopenic obesity. Undernutrition frequency was 1.3 % , and 14.7 % of the older adults were classified as being at undernutrition risk. Sarcopenia is present in one-tenth of the sample. This frequency taken together with undernutrition data warrants further study and preventive measures.
