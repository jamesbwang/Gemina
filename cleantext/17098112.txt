  Flecainide , a class Ic antiarrhythmic , is used for the prevention of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia<symptom> , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter , and sustained ventricular tachycardia<symptom>. Flecainide is primarily metabolized by the liver and to a lesser extent ( 30 %) is excreted unchanged in the kidney. We present a case of flecainide toxicity in the setting of renal impairment that was successfully treated with intravenous sodium bicarbonate.
