  Radiation therapy effectively kills cancer cells and elicits local effects in the irradiated tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of cytokines in the serum of patients with lung cancer undergoing radiation therapy and to identify associations with metabolic tumor burden as determined by 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose ( Forty-five patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer were included in a phase 2 clinical trial and randomized between fractionated thoracic radiation therapy alone or concurrent with an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor. Blood was sampled at 4 different time points: prior to treatment , midtherapy , at the end of therapy , and 6 to 8 weeks after the start of treatment. The serum concentrations of 48 cytokines and 9 matrix metalloproteinases were measured with multiplex immunoassays. A subset of patients was examined by The SUV Cytokine serum levels vary and correlate with metabolic tumor burden in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer undergoing palliative thoracic radiation therapy.
