  Synthetic analogues of natural 5Z,9Z-dienoic acids- hybrid molecules based on the oximes of cholesterol , pregnenolone , and androsterone with 1,14-tetradeca-5Z ,9 Z-dienedicarboxylic acid- were synthesized for the first time and studied for antitumor activity in vitro. The acid was prepared using catalytic cyclomagnesiation of O-containing 1,2-dienes with Grignard reagent in the presence of Cp
