  This systematic review aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of tamoxifen with that of clomiphene citrate ( CC) in anovulatory patients. The PubMed , EMBASE , and CNKI databases were searched up to October 2016 for literature comparing tamoxifen with CC in anovulatory women. The pooled risk ratios ( RR) or standardized mean differences ( SMD) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were subjected to statistical analysis. Twelve studies involving 1302 patients with 2030 ovulation-induction cycles were summarized. There were no statistically significant differences for the ovulation and pregnancy rates in the tamoxifen comparing to the CC group in the pooled analysis. However , in the subgroup of case-control studies , tamoxifen was identified to be associated with higher ovulation ( RR = 1.28 , 95 % CI: 1.07 , 1.54 , I
