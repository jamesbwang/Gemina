  Biogeographic tools support spatial distribution pattern hypotheses and help to determine priority areas for conservation. Our aim was to verify biogeographic patterns for anurans in three mountain<disease> complexes in southeastern Brazil , as well as to discuss the status of species conservation recorded and the biogeographical units evaluated. We selected 16 areas distributed in the Serra da Mantiqueira complex , south of Serra do Espinhaço and Serra da Canastra. We used the occurrence ( geographic coordinates) of each species in the localities to determine areas of endemism applying the Endemicity Analysis method. We also tested whether similarity between areas was explained by geographic distance ( Multiple Regression on distance Matrices-MRM). The Serra do Itatiaia , Serra da Canastra , Plateau of Poços de Caldas and Serra do Cipó were the areas that presented the highest number of species restricted to them. Through the Endemicity Analysis , we identified four areas of endemism with higher scores. The MRM revealed that the geographic distance explained 41 % of species dissimilarity between areas. Most of the endemic species from these areas have inaccurate conservation statuses ( data deficient or unevaluated). These results highlight the need for greater research efforts towards understanding species restricted by distribution , as well as the priority in conserving these endemic areas.
