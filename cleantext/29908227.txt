  Maintenance of pelvic circulation has been connected to reduced risks of ischemic colitis<disease> , buttock claudication , erectile dysfunction , and spinal cord ischemia during the treatment of extensive aortoiliac aneurysmal disease. We evaluate the mid-to-late follow-up of a cohort of patients treated using 1 preservation technique , the endovascular external iliac artery ( EIA) to internal iliac artery ( IIA) bypass. All patients undergoing elective retrograde EIA-IIA endovascular bypass at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed over a 10-year period from 2006 to 2016. Anatomic inclusion criteria were single or bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms<disease> with or without concomitant aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> limiting distal landing zone for endovascular repair and an iliac bifurcation angle greater than 45 °. Procedures were performed using aortouni-iliac ( AUI) endografts extended to 1 EIA ( with endovascular occlusion of the ipsilateral hypogastric artery) , cross-femoral artery bypass , and retrograde placement of 1 of 3 types of covered stent grafts into the contralateral IIA. In the case of patients with prior open repair , AUI placement was not required. Follow-up surveillance included duplex ultrasound 1 and 6 months postoperatively and annually thereafter , with computed tomography scan ( with selective contrast usage) 1 month postoperatively and annually thereafter. Seventeen patients ( mean age 70 years , 93 % male) were treated over the period studied. Most were treated for primary<disease> disease<disease> ( N = 11) while the remainder was secondary interventions following open repair ( N = 4) or endovascular aneurysm<disease> repair ( N = 2). Nine patients had bilateral common iliac aneurysms<disease> , one had bilateral IIA aneurysms<disease> , and the remainder had unilateral iliac aneurysmal degeneration with occluded or severely diseased ipsilateral hypogastric arteries. There was no preference for laterality ( right iliac N = 8 , left iliac N = 9). Retrograde bypasses were performed using Fluency stent graft ( N = 1) , Viabahn stent graft ( N = 13) , or Gore Excluder limbs ( N = 3). Additional hypogastric embolization with AUI extension to the EIA ( for bilateral common iliac aneurysms<disease>) was required in 6 patients. Proximal extension requiring snorkel/fenestration was present in 5 patients. Technical success was 100 % with mean operative time was 168 min ( range 50-300 min) , and 71 cc contrast usage ( range 30-115 cc). Mean preoperative iliac artery aneurysm<disease> size was 4.0 cm with iliac bifurcation angle 71 ° ( range 51-102 °). Median length of stay was 3 days ( range 1-13). Over mean follow-up of 29.8 months , there were no aorta-related mortalities , 1 EIA-IIA bypass occlusion ( asymptomatic) , and 1 reintervention ( for type II endoleak not attributed to the EIA-IIA bypass). There were no additional endoleaks and no sac growth. The incidence of bowel ischemia , paralysis , and bowel/bladder dysfunction was zero in the series. Retrograde endovascular EIA-IIA bypass provides a low risk , high patency option for preservation of a single hypogastric artery with resultant maintenance of pelvic circulation.
