  We developed an additional laser guidance system to improve the efficacy and safety of conventional computed tomography ( CT)- guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy ( PTNB) , and we conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of our system. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 244 patients who underwent CT-guided PTNB using our additional laser guidance system from July 1 , 2015 , to January 20 , 2016. There were nine false-negative results among the 238 total cases. The sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , and diagnostic accuracy of our system for diagnosing malignancy were 94.4 % ( 152/161) , 100 % ( 77/77) , 100 % ( 152/152) , 89.5 % ( 77/86) , and 96.2 % ( 229/238) , respectively. The results of univariate analysis showed that the risk factors for a false-negative result were male sex ( p = 0.029) , a final diagnosis of malignancy ( p = 0.033) , a lesion<symptom> in the lower lobe ( p = 0.035) , shorter distance from the skin<symptom> to the target lesion<symptom> ( p = 0.003) , and shorter distance from the pleura to the target lesion<symptom> ( p = 0.006). The overall complication rate was 30.5 % ( 74/243). Pneumothorax , hemoptysis<symptom> , and hemothorax occurred in 21.8 % ( 53/243) , 9.1 % ( 22/243) , and 1.6 % ( 4/243) of cases , respectively. The additional laser guidance system might be a highly economical and efficient method to improve the diagnostic efficacy and safety of conventional CT-guided PTNB even if performed by inexperienced pulmonologists.
