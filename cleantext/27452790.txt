  Two-dimensional ( 2D) metal-organic frameworks have exhibited a range of fascinating attributes , of interest to numerous fields. Here , a calcium-based metal-organic framework with a 2D layered structure has been designed. Dual emissions relating to intralayer excimers and interlayer trapped excitons are produced , showing excitation-dependent shifting tendency , characteristic of a low dimensional semiconductor nature. Furthermore , the layer stacking by weak van der Waals forces among dynamically coordinated DMF molecules enables exfoliation and morphology transformation , which can be achieved by ultrasound in different ratios of DMF/H
