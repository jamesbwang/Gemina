  Aryldiazoacetates can undergo photolysis under blue light irradiation ( 460-490 nm) at room temperature and under air in the presence of numerous trapping agents , such as styrene , carboxylic acids , amines , alkanes and arenes , thus providing a straighforward and general platform for their mild functionalization.
