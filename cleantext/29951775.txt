  This study assessed dietary intakes , nutritional composition , and identified commonly eaten foods among Jamaicans in Florida. Dietary intake was assessed among 44 study participants to determine commonly eaten foods and nutrient composition. Weighed recipes were collected and analyzed to determine nutrient composition for traditional foods. Top foods that contributed to macronutrient and micronutrient intake were identified and adherence to dietary recommendations was evaluated. Mean daily energy intake was 2879 ( SD 1179) kcal and 2242 ( SD 1236) kcal for men and women respectively. Mean macronutrient intakes were above dietary recommendations for men and women. Top foods contributing to energy included rice and peas , sweetened juices , chicken , red peas soup , and hot chocolate drink. Results showed sodium intake was more than double the adequate intake estimate ( 1300-1500 mg). Findings highlight the need to include commonly eaten traditional foods in dietary questionnaires to accurately assess diet-related chronic<disease> disease<disease> risk. Findings have implications for risk factor intervention and prevention efforts among Jamaicans.
