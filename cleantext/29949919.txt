  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( T-ALL) is an aggressive blood malignancy that arises from the clonal expansion of transformed T-cell precursors. Although T-ALL prognosis has significantly improved due to the development of intensive chemotherapeutic protocols , primary drug-resistant and relapsed patients still display a dismal outcome. In addition , lifelong irreversible late effects from conventional therapy are a growing problem for leukemia<disease> survivors. Therefore , novel targeted therapies are required to improve the prognosis of high-risk patients. The mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR) is the kinase subunit of two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes , which are referred to as mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1) and mTORC2. These two complexes regulate a variety of physiological cellular processes including protein , lipid , and nucleotide synthesis , as well as autophagy in response to external cues. However , mTOR activity is frequently deregulated in cancer , where it plays a key oncogenetic role driving tumor cell proliferation , survival , metabolic transformation , and metastatic potential. Promising preclinical studies using mTOR inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in many human cancer types , including T-ALL. Here , we highlight our current knowledge of mTOR signaling and inhibitors in T-ALL , with an emphasis on emerging evidence of the superior efficacy of combinations consisting of mTOR inhibitors and either traditional or targeted therapeutics.
