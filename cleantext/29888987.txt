  Advances in molecular biology technologies have allowed uncovering the role of epigenetic regulation in several complex<disease> diseases<disease> , such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Although the role of epigenetic mechanisms in Alzheimer 's disease is still little understood , recent findings clearly show that such mechanisms are dysregulated during disease progression , already in its early stages. However , it is not clear if the observed epigenetic changes represent a cause or a consequence of the disease. Promising results are emerging from studies performed in peripheral blood DNA that could provide early biomarkers of the pathology. Moreover , given the dynamic nature of the epigenetic marks , intense research is carried out to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of compounds exerting epigenetic properties.
