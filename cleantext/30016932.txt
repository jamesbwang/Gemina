  Turmeric is a rich source of bioactive compounds useful in both medicine and cuisine. Mineral concentrations effects ( PO The total content of volatiles was affected by fertilizer treatments , and in vitro treatment with Ca These results show that minerals in the in vitro bioreactor medium during rhizome development affected biosynthesis of turmeric volatile components after transfer to the greenhouse six months later. The multi-factor design identified 1) nutrient regulation of specific components within unique phytochemical profile for Curcuma longa L. clone 35-1 and 2) the varied phytochemical profiles were maintained with integrity during the greenhouse growth in high fertility conditions.
