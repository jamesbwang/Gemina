  There is a paucity of data on the epidemiology of sepsis<pathogen> in outborn neonates being referred to level-3 units in low- and middle-income countries ( LMIC). The objective of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of sepsis<pathogen> and outcomes of outborn neonates with sepsis<pathogen> , and to characterize the pathogen profile and antimicrobial resistance ( AMR) patterns of common isolates in them. In this prospective observational cohort study ( 2011-2015) , a dedicated research team enrolled all neonates admitted to an outborn level-3 neonatal unit and followed them until discharge/death. Sepsis<pathogen> work-up including blood culture ( s) was performed upon suspicion of sepsis.<pathogen> All the isolates were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Gram-negative pathogens resistant to any three of the five antibiotic classes ( extended-spectrum cephalosporins , carbapenems , aminoglycosides , fluoroquinolones<pathogen> , and piperacillin-tazobactam) were labeled multi-drug resistant. Of the total of 2588 neonates enrolled , culture positive sepsis<pathogen> and total sepsis-i.e. culture positive and/or culture negative sepsis-was diagnosed in 13.1 % ( 95 % CI 11.8 % to 14.5 %) and 54.7 % ( 95 % CI 52.8 % to 56.6 %) , respectively. The case fatality rates were 23.4 % and 11.0 % in culture-positive and total sepsis<pathogen> , respectively. Sepsis<pathogen> accounted for two-thirds of total neonatal deaths ( 153/235 , 63.0 %). Bacterial isolates caused about three-fourths ( 296/401; 73.8 %) of the infections. The two common pathogens-Klebsiella pneumoniae<pathogen> ( n = 50 , 12.5 %) and Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> ( n = 46 , 11.5 %)- showed high degree of multi-drug resistance ( 78.0 % and 91.3 % , respectively) and carbapenem resistance ( 84.0 % and 91.3 % , respectively). About a quarter of infections were caused by Candida spp. ( n = 91; 22.7 %); almost three-fourths ( 73.7 %) of these infections occurred in neonates born at or after 32 weeks ' gestation and about two-thirds ( 62.1 %) in those weighing 1500 g or more at birth. In this large outborn cohort , we report high burden of sepsis<pathogen> , high prevalence of systemic fungal infections , and alarming rates of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens.
