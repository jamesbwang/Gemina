  A post-marketing surveillance study reported fatalities following tissue plasminogen activator administration in acute aortic dissection ( AAD) with the symptoms of acute ischemic stroke ( AIS) patients. Therefore , it is important to discriminate AAD from AIS. The present study aimed to investigate whether fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products ( FDP) value can be useful in differential diagnosis between AAD and AIS. The study group comprised 20 AAD patients ( 10 men and 10 women; age 63.9 ± 13.6 years) and 159 AIS patients ( 91 men and 68 women; age 74.2 ± 10.6 years) who were transported to our hospital from 2007 to 2012. The AAD cases were further divided into patent-type AAD and thrombosed-type AAD. FDP values were significantly higher in the AAD group than in the AIS group ( 18.15 ( 5.2- 249.9) μg/ml vs. 2.3 ( 1.5- 4.45) μg/ml; P < 0.001). In AAD groups , FDP values were significantly higher in the patent-type AAD group ( n = 9) than in the thrombosed type AAD group ( n = 11) ( 293.2 μg/ml ( 63.1- 419.6 μg/ml) vs. 5.6 μg/ml ( 3.8- 7.9 μg/ml). FDP values were significantly higher in patients with AAD than in those with AIS , especially those with patent-type AAD compared with AIS patients. High FDP values may be a useful marker for differential diagnosis between patent-type AAD and AIS.
