  Fetal erythropoietin ( EPO) , in addition to regulating erythropoiesis , has also tissue-protective properties based on its anti-inflammatory , anti-apoptotic , antioxidant , and neurotrophic effects. Notably , EPO concentrations needed for tissue protection are 100-1000 times higher than concentrations needed for regulating erythropoiesis. This dual effect of EPO is based on EPO-receptor ( EPO-R) isoforms , which differ structurally and functionally. We hypothesize in this Integrated Mechanism Review that during severe fetal hypoxia the observed , but poorly understood , marked increases of fetal plasma EPO concentrations occur to protect the brain , heart , and other vital fetal organs. We further hypothesize that the concurrent marked increases of EPO in the amniotic fluid during fetal hypoxia , occur to protect newborn infants from necrotizing enterocolitis<disease> This review presents experimental and clinical evidence in support of these hypotheses and points out unknown or poorly understood functions of EPO in the fetus. If these novel hypotheses are correct , the importance of fetal EPO as an antenatal hypoxia biomarker will become apparent. It will also likely point the way to important diagnostic and therapeutic fetal and neonatal interventions.
