  We aimed to test whether the calmodulin ( CaM) inhibitors , calmidazolium ( CZ) and N- ( 6-aminohexyl) -5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide ( W-7) , can be used to assess lipid disorder by flow cytometry using Merocyanine 540 ( M540). Boar spermatozoa were incubated in non-capacitating conditions for 10 min at room temperature with 1 μM CZ , 200 μM W-7 , or 1 mM 8-bromoadenosine 3 ' ,5 '- cyclic monophosphate ( 8-Br-cAMP). Then , the sperm were 1) directly evaluated , 2) centrifuged and washed prior to evaluation , or 3) diluted with PBS prior to evaluation. Direct evaluation showed an increase in high M540 fluorescence in spermatozoa treated with the inhibitors ( 4.7 ± 1.8 ( control) vs. 70.4 ± 4.0 ( CZ) and 71.4 ± 4.2 ( W-7) , mean % ± SD , P < 0.001); washing decreased the percentage of sperm showing high M540 fluorescence for W-7 ( 4.8 ± 2.2 , mean % ± SD) but not for CZ ( 69.4 ± 3.9 , mean % ± SD , P < 0.001) , and dilution showed an increase in high M540 fluorescence for both CZ and W-7; 8-Br-cAMP did not induce a rise in sperm showing high M540 fluorescence. Therefore , special care must be taken when M540 is used in spermatozoa with CaM inhibitors.
