  The investigation was done to assess the impacts of probiotic supplementation on movement and metabolic parameters in individuals with Parkinson 's disease ( PD). The study is randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial , which was done in sixty people with PD. Individuals were randomly divided into two groups in order to take either 8 × 10 Compared with the placebo , consuming probiotic decreased MDS-UPDRS ( -4.8 ± 12.5 vs. +3.8 ± 13.0 , P = 0.01). Probiotic supplementation also reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( -1.6 ± 2.5 vs. +0.1 ± 0.3 mg/L , P < 0.001) and malondialdehyde ( -0.2 ± 0.3 vs. +0.1 ± 0.3 μmol/L , P = 0.006) , and enhanced glutathione levels ( +40.1 ± 81.5 vs. -12.1 ± 41.7 μmol/L , P = 0.03) in comparison with the placebo. Additionally , probiotic consumption resulted in a statistically significant reduction in insulin levels ( -2.1 ± 3.4 vs. +1.5 ± 5.1 μIU/mL , P = 0.002) and insulin resistance ( -0.5 ± 0.9 vs. +0.4 ± 1.2 , P = 0.002) , and a statistically significant rise in insulin sensitivity ( +0.01 ± 0.02 vs. -0.006 ± 0.02 , P = 0.01) in comparison with the placebo. Probiotic intake had no any significant impact on other metabolic profiles. Our study evidenced that 12 weeks of probiotic consumption by individuals with PD had useful impacts on MDS-UPDRS and few metabolic profiles.
