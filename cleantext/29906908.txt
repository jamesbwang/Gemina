  By controlling the vortex core energy , the three-state ferromagnetic Potts model can exhibit two types of topological paradigms , including the quasi-long-range ordered phase and the vortex lattice phase ( Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 , 097206 ( 2016) PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/ PhysRevLett .116.097206). Here , using Monte Carlo simulations using an efficient worm algorithm , we show that by controlling the vortex core energy , the antiferromagnetic Potts model can also exhibit the two topological phases , and , more interestingly , the two topological phases can overlap with each other.
