  Although dietary patterns have been evaluated in relation to psychological disorders , their associations with psychosomatic complaints are unclear. We investigated relations of dietary patterns with psychosomatic complaints profiles. In this cross-sectional study , a total of 3363 adults were included. Dietary intakes and psychosomatic complaints were assessed using self-administered Persian validated questionnaires. Dietary patterns and psychosomatic symptom profiles were identified using exploratory factor analysis. Three dietary patterns and four psychosomatic complaints profiles were identified. Individuals in the top tertile of traditional diet had lower odds for gastrointestinal somatic complaints ( odds ratio ( OR) = 0.68 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.50 , 0.91). Individuals in the top tertile of healthy diet had lower odds for psychological ( OR = 0.68 , 95 % CI: 0.51 , 0.90) , gastrointestinal ( OR = 0.65 , 95 % CI: 0.49 , 0.87) , neuro-skeletal ( OR = 0.66 , 95 % CI: 0.45 , 0.96) , and pharyngeal<symptom>- respiratory somatic complaints ( OR = 0.61 , 95 % CI: 0.47 , 0.79). Individuals in the top tertile of Western diet had greater odds for psychological somatic complaints ( OR = 1.50 , 95 % CI: 1.13 , 2.00) than those in the first tertile. The healthy dietary pattern is inversely related to the risk of psychosomatic complaints , whereas the Western diet might be associated with increased risk of psychosomatic complaints.
