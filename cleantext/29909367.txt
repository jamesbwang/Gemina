  It is thought that CD28 plays a crucial role in the maintenance of regulatory T cell ( Treg) pool size through promoting the development and proliferation of these cells. However , recently we found that the dependency on CD28 co-stimulation for their development is different between Treg subsets , thymus-derived Tregs ( tTregs , CD28-dependent) and peripherally-derived Tregs ( pTregs , CD28-independent) , suggesting that CD28 may also have differential influences on the homeostasis of each Treg subset. Here , we demonstrated that both Treg subsets were reduced in secondary lymphoid organs of CD28 deficient mice , and that this reduction was due to impaired proliferation in both Treg subsets by the intrinsic CD28 defect. However , we found that the massive proliferation of both Treg subsets under lymphopenic condition was regulated by CD28 , whereas the proliferative activity of tTregs but not pTregs in the steady state was dependent on CD28. Also , experiments using mutant CD28 knock-in mice revealed that proliferation of pTregs under lymphopenic condition required only the Lck-NFÎºB pathway of CD28 , whereas tTregs required an additional unknown pathway. These findings indicate that the dependency on CD28 for proliferation in each Treg subset differs depending on the environment.
