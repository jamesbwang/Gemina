  We provide advances in DCL and RDR gene diversity in Solanaceae. We also shed light on DCL and RDR gene expression in response to cold stress. DICER-like ( DCL) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RDR) genes form the core components to trigger small non-coding RNA ( ncRNA) production. In spite of this , little is known about the two gene families in non-model plant species. As their genome sequences are now available , the cultivated potato ( Solanum tuberosum) and its cold-tolerant wild relative Solanum commersonii offer a valuable opportunity to advance our understanding of the above genes. To determine the extent of diversification and evolution of DCLs and RDRs in these species , we performed a comparative analysis. Seven DCLs were identified in the two species , whereas seven and six RDR genes were found in S. tuberosum and S. commersonii , respectively. Based on phylogenetic analysis with DCLs and RDRs from several species , we provide evidence for an increase in their number in both potato species. We also disclosed that tandem duplications played a major role in the evolution of these gene families in Solanaceae. DCL and RDR expression was investigated in different tissues and under cold and virus stresses , with divergent profiles of the tandem duplicated genes being found in different tissues. DCL paralogs showed a contrasting expression in S. tuberosum and S. commersonii following cold stress and virus infection. By contrast , no change in RDR transcript activity was detected following both stresses. Overall , this study provides the first comparative genomic analysis of the core components of the RNAi machinery in Solanaceae and offers a scaffold for future functional analysis of these gene families.
