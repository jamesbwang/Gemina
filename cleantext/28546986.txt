  Hospital crowding is a rising problem , effective predicting and detecting managment can helpful to reduce crowding. Our team has successfully proposed a hybrid model combining both the autoregressive integrated moving average ( ARIMA) and the nonlinear autoregressive neural network ( NARNN) models in the schistosomiasis and hand , foot , and mouth<disease> disease<disease> forecasting study. In this paper , our aim is to explore the application of the hybrid ARIMA-NARNN model to track the trends of the new admission inpatients , which provides a methodological basis for reducing crowding. We used the single seasonal ARIMA ( SARIMA) , NARNN and the hybrid SARIMA-NARNN model to fit and forecast the monthly and daily number of new admission inpatients. The root mean square error ( RMSE) , mean absolute error ( MAE) and mean absolute percentage error ( MAPE) were used to compare the forecasting performance among the three models. The modeling time range of monthly data included was from January 2010 to June 2016 , July to October 2016 as the corresponding testing data set. The daily modeling data set was from January 4 to September 4 , 2016 , while the testing time range included was from September 5 to October 2 , 2016. For the monthly data , the modeling RMSE and the testing RMSE , MAE and MAPE of SARIMA-NARNN model were less than those obtained from the single SARIMA or NARNN model , but the MAE and MAPE of modeling performance of SARIMA-NARNN model did not improve. For the daily data , all RMSE , MAE and MAPE of NARNN model were the lowest both in modeling stage and testing stage. Hybrid model does not necessarily outperform its constituents ' performances. It is worth attempting to explore the reliable model to forecast the number of new admission inpatients from different data.
