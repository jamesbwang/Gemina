  As RNA viruses mutate and adapt to environmental changes , often developing resistance to anti-viral vaccines and drugs , they form an ensemble of viral strains-- a viral quasispecies. While high-throughput sequencing ( HTS) has enabled in-depth studies of viral quasispecies , sequencing errors and limited read lengths render the problem of reconstructing the strains and estimating their spectrum challenging. Inference of viral quasispecies is difficult due to generally non-uniform frequencies of the strains , and is further exacerbated when the genetic distances between the strains are small. This paper presents TenSQR , an algorithm that utilizes tensor factorization framework to analyze HTS data and reconstruct viral quasispecies characterized by highly uneven frequencies of its components. Fundamentally , TenSQR performs clustering with successive data removal to infer strains in a quasispecies in order from the most to the least abundant one; every time a strain is inferred , sequencing reads generated from that strain are removed from the dataset. The proposed successive strain reconstruction and data removal enables discovery of rare strains in a population and facilitates detection of deletions in such strains. Results on simulated datasets demonstrate that TenSQR can reconstruct full-length strains having widely different abundances , generally outperforming state-of-the-art methods at diversities 1-10 % and detecting long deletions even in rare strains. A study on a real HIV-1 dataset demonstrates that TenSQR outperforms competing methods in experimental settings as well. Finally , we apply TenSQR to analyze a Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> sample and reconstruct the full-length strains it contains. TenSQR is available at https://github.com/SoYeonA/TenSQR.
