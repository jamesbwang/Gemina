  The aim of this study was to investigate aesthetic outcome and patient satisfaction in women who have undergone DIEP reconstruction in the setting of PMRT. Patients who underwent DIEP reconstruction without PMRT were the control group. Participants who had undergone DIEP between 9/1/2009- 9/1/2014 were recruited , answered the BREAST-Q and underwent 3D surface-imaging. A panel assessed the aesthetic outcome by reviewing these images. 167 women participated. 80 ( 48 %) underwent immediate DIEP reconstruction and no PMRT , 28 ( 17 %) immediate DIEP with PMRT , 38 ( 23 %) simple mastectomy , PMRT then DIEP and 21 ( 13 %) mastectomy with temporizing implant , PMRT then DIEP. Median satisfaction scores were significantly different between the groups ( P < 0.05). Post-hoc comparison demonstrated that women who had an immediate DIEP reconstruction were significantly less satisfied if they had PMRT. In women requiring PMRT , those undergoing delayed reconstruction after a simple mastectomy were most satisfied but there was no significant difference between the immediate DIEP and temporizing implant groups.Median panel scores differed between groups , being significantly higher if the immediate reconstruction was not subjected to PMRT. There was no significant difference in panel assessment between the three groups of women who had received PMRT. Patients who avoid having their immediate DIEP reconstruction irradiated are more satisfied and have better aesthetic outcome than those who undergo PMRT. In women requiring PMRT and wish to have an immediate or ` delayed-immediate ' reconstruction there were no significant differences in panel or patient satisfaction , therefore immediate DIEP or mastectomy with temporizing implant then DIEP are acceptable treatment pathways.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
