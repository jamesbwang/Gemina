  Day length has been shown to be a major source of temporal information regulating seasonal reproduction in the Eurasian tree sparrow ( Passer montanus). The present study aims to investigate the photoperiodic expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-I ( GnRH-I) , and how it mediates seasonal reproduction in male tree sparrows. In different experiments , we studied photoperiod-induced changes in GnRH-I expressing neurons in the hypothalamic preoptic area ( POA) , together with changes in testicular size under both natural and artificial photoperiodic conditions. Experiment 1 , which involved studying changes in GnRH-I expression and testicular volume during different phases of the annual reproductive cycle under natural day length ( NDL) , revealed that sparrows possess a definite seasonal cycle of GnRH-I peptide expression that runs parallel to testicular size. Birds showed significantly higher levels of GnRH-I expression in the breeding phase when compared to the non-breeding phase. In experiment 2 , photosensitive birds were exposed to artificial short ( SD: 9L/15D) and long ( LD: 14L/10D) day lengths for 240 days to investigate the photoperiodic regulation of GnRH-I expression. They exhibited a significant increase followed by a decrease in GnRH-I expression and testicular size under LD but not SD , suggesting photoperiodic regulation. In experiment 3 , when photosensitive birds were exposed to increasing photoperiods ( 9L/15D , 10L/14D , 10.5 L/13 .5 D , 11L/13D , 12L/12D) for 30 days to find out the critical photoperiod for GnRH-I expression , they responded only when the daily photoperiod was 11 h or more. These results clearly indicate that tree sparrows are capable of fine discrimination of photoperiodic information and use day length for GnRH-I expression to control their seasonal reproduction.
