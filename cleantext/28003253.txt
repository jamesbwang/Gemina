  To reveal the physiological mechanism of the cognitive decline in subjects with hypertension , the functional connectivity ( FC) was assessed by using the wavelet phase coherence ( WPCO) , and effective connectivity ( EC) was assessed by using the coupling strength ( CS) of near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS) signals. NIRS signals were continuously recorded from the prefrontal cortex , sensorimotor cortex , and occipital lobes of 13 hypertensive patients ( hypertension group , 70 ± 6.5 years old) and 16 elderly healthy subjects ( control group , 71 ± 5.5 years old) in resting and standing periods. WPCO and CS were calculated in four frequency intervals: I , 0.6-2; II , 0.145-0.6; III , 0.052-0.145; and IV , 0.021-0.052 Hz. CS quantifies coupling amplitude. In comparison with the control group , the hypertension group showed significantly decreased (
