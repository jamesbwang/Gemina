  To observe whether the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 ( TRPV 1) plays a role in moxibustion ( Moxi)- induced regulation of local immune inflammatory response. Fifteen C 57 BL/6 J and 15 TRPV 1 In both C 57 BL/6 J and TRPV 1 Moxibustion stimulation of ST 36 can induce structural changes of the regional epidermis and dermis of the skin and up-regulate the number of TNF-Î± IR-positive cells in both C 57 BL/6 J and TRPV 1
