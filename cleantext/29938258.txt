  Two dimensional ( 2D) materials with hexagonal building blocks have received tremendous interest in recent years and show promise as nanoscale devices for versatile applications. Herein , we propose a new family of 2D pentagonal CrX ( X = S , Se or Te) monolayers ( penta-CrX) for applications in electronics , spintronics and photocatalysis. We find that the 2D penta-CrX monolayers are thermally , structurally and mechanically stable. The penta-CrX monolayers are antiferromagnetic and semiconducting. We show that the magnetism is attributed to the super-exchange induced by the ionic interactions between the Cr and X atoms and can be enhanced upon applying tension. We further show that the penta-CrS and penta-CrSe monolayers show good redox potentials versus a normal hydrogen electrode , and their band gaps are comparable to the energy of a photon in the visible light region , indicating their capability of maximal utilization of solar energy for water splitting. With intrinsic semiconducting and controllable magnetic properties , the proposed penta-CrX monolayers may hold promise as flexible spintronics and photocatalysts.
