  Haptic simulation systems , which typically implement virtual environments in the discrete-time domain , present an inherent trade-off between stability , sampling frequency , and the range of implementable environment dynamics. Previous research has demonstrated the potential of analog feedback for expanding the range of environment dynamics that result in a stable haptic interaction. In this paper , the effect of various system parameters on the environment dynamic range is analytically and experimentally investigated in the sense of uncoupled stability. In addition , Multilayer Decomposition , which enables a simple analog PD controller to implement nonhomogeneous or multilayer virtual environment dynamics , will be presented and evaluated.
