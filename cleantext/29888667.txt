  The objective of this study was to identify the bioactive compounds of essential oil and evaluate the antibacterial activity of the essential oil extracted from Chenopodium album<pathogen> subsp. striatum<pathogen> against multidrug-resistant bacterial strains ( MDR) which were isolated from clinical specimens by conventional methods. Furthermore , eight different Gram-negative and Gram-positive multidrug-resistant bacterial strains were used to investigate the antibacterial potential of the essential oil. The antibacterial activity was tested using MIC and MBC microdilution method , well and disc diffusion in different concentration. The hydro-distillation of aerial parts powder yield was 0.466 % ( v/w). Essential oil showed bactericidal activity against both MDR Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains. MIC and MBC results were ranged from 0.31 to 2.5 and 0.62 to 5.0 mg/mL. The inhibition zones in well-diffusion method were ranged from 7 ± 0.6 mm to 15 ± 1.0 mm. Disc diffusion method was ranged from 7 ± 0.0 mm to 16 ± 0.6 mm depending on the type of bacteria strain and essential oil concentration. Essential oil of Ch. album<pathogen> had the greatest potential to be considered as an antibacterial agent against MDR bacteria strain. This potential was due to different biological and bioactive compounds like phytol , linalool , α-terpineol and linolenic acid in the plant.
