  In the last few decades , an increasing number of studies have focused on better characterizing the cerebellar functions beyond motor control , including emotional and social domains. Anatomic and functional evidence strongly contributes to delineating the cerebellar functional subdivisions and their integration with cerebral functional networks strictly related to emotional regulation and social functioning , thus suggesting a model of cerebellar organization that resembles that of the cerebral cortex. Overcoming the traditional segregation of cerebrocerebellar networks in sensorimotor/cognitive functional modules , during emotional/social processes , the cerebellar activity reflects a domain-specific mentalizing functionality that is strongly connected with corresponding mentalizing networks in the cerebrum. Additionally , the cerebrocerebellar organization has been shown to have a specific functional and maturational trajectory that is only in part dependent on a structural maturational process and that is protracted from an early stage of life through adolescence and adulthood , when the mature control networks involve both segregation and integration of the brain regions that comprise them. Altogether , these findings underscore the importance of regional functional differences within the cerebellum in relation to emotional and social processing and raise questions about the clinical implication of cerebellar injury on emotional/social behaviors , both in the developing and the adult brain.
