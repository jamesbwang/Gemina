  A plausible explanation for statistical epistasis revealed in genome wide association analyses is the presence of high order linkage disequilibrium ( LD) between the genotyped markers tested for interactions and unobserved functional polymorphisms. Based on findings in experimental data , it has been suggested that high order LD might be a common explanation for statistical epistasis inferred between local polymorphisms in the same genomic region. Here , we empirically evaluate how prevalent high order LD is between local , as well as distal , polymorphisms in the genome. This could provide insights into whether we should account for this when interpreting results from genome wide scans for statistical epistasis. An extensive and strong genome wide high order LD was revealed between pairs of markers on the high density 250k SNP-chip and individual markers revealed by whole genome sequencing in the
