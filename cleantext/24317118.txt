  The tumor microenvironment restrains conventional T cell ( Tconv) activation while facilitating the expansion of Tregs. Here we showed that Tregs ' advantage in the tumor milieu relies on supplemental energetic routes involving lipid metabolism. In murine models , tumor-infiltrating Tregs displayed intracellular lipid accumulation , which was attributable to an increased rate of fatty acid ( FA) synthesis. Since the relative advantage in glucose uptake may fuel FA synthesis in intratumoral Tregs , we demonstrated that both glycolytic and oxidative metabolism contribute to Tregs ' expansion. We corroborated our data in human tumors showing that Tregs displayed a gene signature oriented toward glycolysis and lipid synthesis. Our data support a model in which signals from the tumor microenvironment induce a circuitry of glycolysis , FA synthesis , and oxidation that confers a preferential proliferative advantage to Tregs , whose targeting might represent a strategy for cancer treatment.
