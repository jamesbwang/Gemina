  Kidney transplantation is the best strategy for the management of end-stage renal disease; however , the outcomes need to improve further. Macrolides show antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties in chronic<disease> diseases<disease> and intraoperatively , and can accumulate in tissues for extended periods. Therefore , theoretically , when administered to a donor and because of accumulation in the donor kidney , macrolides can cause graft immunomodulation and improve kidney transplantation outcomes. This study is a single-center , randomized clinical trial. A total of 60 kidney donors will be randomly allocated to the azithromycin or placebo group and treated with a single dose ( 1 g) of azithromycin or placebo , respectively , 1 day before surgery. Recruitment commenced in September 2016 and is expected to be completed by March 2018. The primary outcome is kidney graft function. The secondary outcomes include rejection rate , urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> in graft recipients , pain and systemic inflammatory response syndrome<disease> in live donors , and complications in both donors and recipients. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline and every day in the first week after transplantation , as well as at 1 and 3 months post transplantation. Adverse reactions will be documented. If the efficacy of azithromycin in reducing adverse outcomes is confirmed , it would serve as an easy to use , economic intervention able to lower post-transplantation risks. Short and mid-term analyses of blood and urine samples as well as immunological assays will facilitate a more in-depth analysis of the effects of azithromycin on transplantation outcomes.
