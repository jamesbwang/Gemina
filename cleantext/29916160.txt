  High-quality genomic DNA extraction is a starting point for many downstream applications in modern molecular biology. Here , we describe a simple method for isolating high molecular weight genomic DNA from planarians. The method is based on tissue lysis by a mixture of a chaotropic salt and detergent followed by organic extraction to remove proteins and lipids followed by a postpurification step to remove contaminating polysaccharides. The isolated DNA is of high molecular weight and compatible with polymerase chain reaction , cloning , or next-generation sequencing library preparation.
