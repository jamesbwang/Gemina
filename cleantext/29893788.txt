  The value of the American Board of Internal Medicine 's ( ABIM) Maintenance of Certification ( MOC) program has been questioned as a marker of physician quality. To assess whether physician MOC status is associated with performance on selected Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set ( HEDIS) process measures. Annual comparisons of HEDIS process measures among physicians who did or did not maintain certification 20 years after initial certification. Fee-for-service Medicare. 1260 general internists who were initially certified in 1991 and provided care for 85931 Medicare patients between 2009 and 2012. Annual percentage of a physician 's Medicare patients meeting each of 5 HEDIS annual or biennial standards and a composite indicating meeting all 3 HEDIS diabetes standards. Among the 1260 physicians , 786 maintained their certification from 1991 to 2012 and 474 did not. The mean annual percentage of HEDIS-eligible diabetic patients who completed semiannual hemoglobin A1c testing was 58.4 % among physicians who maintained certification and 54.4 % among those who did not ( regression-adjusted difference , 4.2 percentage points ( 95 % CI , 2.0 to 6.5 percentage points); P < 0.001). Diabetic patients of physicians who maintained certification more frequently met the annual standard for low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) cholesterol measurement ( 83.1 % vs. 80.5 %; regression-adjusted difference , 2.3 percentage points ( CI , 0.6 to 4.1 percentage points); P = 0.008) and all 3 diabetic standards ( 46.0 % vs. 41.6 %; regression-adjusted difference , 3.1 percentage points ( CI , 0.5 to 5.7 percentage points); P = 0.019). The regression-adjusted difference in biennial eye examinations was statistically insignificant ( P = 0.112). Measures for LDL cholesterol testing in patients with coronary heart disease and biennial mammography were also met more frequently among physicians who maintained certification ( 79.4 % vs. 77.4 % and 72.0 % vs. 67.8 % , respectively) , with regression-adjusted differences of 1.7 percentage points ( CI , 0.2 to 3.3 percentage points; P = 0.032) and 4.6 percentage points ( CI , 2.9 to 6.3 percentage points; P < 0.001) , respectively. Potential confounding by unobserved patient , physician , and practice characteristics; inability to determine clinical significance of observed differences. Maintaining certification was positively associated with physician performance scores on a set of HEDIS process measures. American Board of Internal Medicine.
