  Mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs) exert immunosuppressive effects on immune cells including dendritic cells ( DCs). However , many details of the bidirectional interaction of MSCs with DCs are still unsolved and information on key molecules by which DCs can modulate MSC functions is limited. Here , we report that osteopontin ( OPN) , a cytokine involved in homeostatic and pathophysiologic responses , is constitutively expressed by DCs and regulated in the DC/MSC cocultures depending on the activation state of MSCs. Resting MSCs promoted OPN production , whereas the production of OPN was suppressed when MSCs were activated by proinflammatory cytokines ( i.e. , TNF-α , IL-6 , and IL-1β). OPN induction required cell-to-cell contact , mediated at least in part , by β1 integrin ( CD29). Conversely , activated MSCs inhibited the release of OPN
