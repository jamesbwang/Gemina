  Volatile Organic Compounds ( VOCs) are reactive compounds essential to atmospheric chemistry. They are mainly emitted by living organisms , and mostly by plants. Soil microbes also contribute to emissions of VOCs. However , these emissions have not yet been characterised in terms of quality and quantity. Furthermore , long-term organic matter amendments are known to affect the microbial content of soils , and hence the quantity and quality of VOC emissions. This study investigates which and how much of these VOCs are emitted from soil amended with organic waste products ( OWPs). Four OWPs were investigated: municipal solid waste compost ( MSW) , green waste and sludge co-compost ( GWS) , bio-waste compost ( BIOW) and farmyard manure ( FYM). These OWPs have been amended every two years since 1998 until now at a rate of ~ 4 tC ha
