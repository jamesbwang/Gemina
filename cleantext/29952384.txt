  We studied the isotopic composition of ozone formed at low ( 3-10 K) temperature via O + O2 solid state reactions using a partially dissociated 16O/16O2: 18O/18O2 = 1: 1 mixture. The ozone ice has an isotopic abundance that differs from the statistical one and from gas phase studies. Ozone formation is influenced by the competition of the production of O2 ( O + O or O + O3) vs. O3 ( O + O2) and by the energy released in the O + O reaction. The exothermicity of the O + O reaction helps to overcome the barrier of the O + O2 reaction. Heating the ozone ice past 50 K brings about a transformation from amorphous to crystalline ice. The formation of ozone on water ice yields a blue shift of IR bands , and the yield of formed O3 increases up to the sample temperature of 100 K. When 18O/18O2 is deposited on H216O ice , formation of 18O18O16O is detected. We propose that the exothermicity of the reaction 18O + 18O drives water dissociation ( 16O + H2) followed by ozone formation ( 16O + 18O2 â†’ 16O18O18O).
