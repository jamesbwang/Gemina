  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer worldwide. CRC is still associated with a poor prognosis among patients with advanced disease. On the contrary , due to its slow progression from detectable precancerous lesions<symptom> , the prognosis for patients with early stages of CRC is encouraging. While most robust methods are invasive and costly , actual patient-friendly screening methods for CRC suffer of lack of sensitivity and specificity. Therefore , the development of sensitive , non-invasive and cost-effective methods for CRC detection and prognosis are necessary for increasing the chances of a cure. Beyond its beneficial functions for the host , increasing evidence suggests that the intestinal microbiota is a key factor associated with carcinogenesis. Many clinical studies have reported a disruption in the gut microbiota balance<symptom> and an alteration in the faecal metabolome of CRC patients , suggesting the potential use of a microbial-based test as a non-invasive diagnostic and/or prognostic tool for CRC screening. This review aims to discuss the microbial signatures associated with CRC known to date , including dysbiosis and faecal metabolome alterations , and the potential use of microbial variation markers for non-invasive early diagnosis and/or prognostic assessment of CRC and advanced adenomas. We will finally discuss the possible use of these markers as predicators for treatment response and their limitations.
