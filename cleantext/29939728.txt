  Conversion of biological molecules into fuels or other useful chemicals is an ongoing chemical challenge. One class of enzymes that has received attention for such applications is aldehyde deformylating oxygenase ( ADO) enzymes. These enzymes convert aliphatic aldehydes to the alkanes and formate. In this work , we prepared and investigated ADO enzymes modified with Ru
