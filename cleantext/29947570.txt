  This study was undertaken with the objective to investigate the potential involvement of VAX2 in retinal degeneration. A cohort of macular and cone dystrophy patients ( n = 70) was screened for variant identification. Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) products were purified using ExoSAP-IT. Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed using BigDye 3.1 on the ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer and analyzed using DNASTAR software tool. Search for known variant was performed using the following platforms: 1000 Genomes Project , Ensembl , UCSC , ExAc , and dbSNP. The VAX2 mutants were generated using the GeneArt Â® Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit. In vitro analysis was performed in hTERTRPE-1 ( RPE-1) cell line. Cells were photographed using a Zeiss AXIOVERT S100 microscope. Images were analyzed using Photoshop CS4 software. Here , we report the identification of a heterozygous non-synonymous variant ( c. 416T > G; p.Leu139Arg) in one cone dystrophy proband. Functional characterization of this variant in vitro revealed an aberrant phenotype seen as protein mislocalization to cytoplasm/nucleus and aggregates undergoing degradation or forming aggresomes. The cellular phenotype suggests protein loss-of-function. Analysis of the VAX2 p.Leu139Met , a variant present in the normal population , showed a phenotype similar to the wild-type , further supporting the hypothesis for the Leucine 139 to Arginine change to be damaging. This study raises the interesting possibility for evaluating VAX2 as a candidate gene for cone dystrophy.
