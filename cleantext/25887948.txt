  Practice of meditation or exercise may enhance health to protect against acute infectious illness. To assess preventive effects of meditation and exercise on acute<disease> respiratory<disease> infection<disease> ( ARI) illness. Randomized controlled prevention trial with three parallel groups. Madison , Wisconsin , USA. Community-recruited adults who did not regularly exercise or meditate. 1) 8-week behavioral training in mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR); 2) matched 8-week training in moderate intensity sustained exercise ( EX); or 3) observational waitlist control. Training classes occurred in September and October , with weekly ARI surveillance through May. Incidence , duration , and area-under-curve ARI global severity were measured using daily reports on the WURSS-24 during ARI illness. Viruses were identified multiplex PCR. Absenteeism , health care utilization , and psychosocial health self-report assessments were also employed. Of 413 participants randomized , 390 completed the trial. In the MBSR group , 74 experienced 112 ARI episodes with 1045 days of ARI illness. Among exercisers , 84 had 120 episodes totaling 1010 illness days. Eighty-two of the controls had 134 episodes with 1210 days of ARI illness. Mean global severity was 315 for MBSR ( 95 % confidence interval 244 , 386) , 256 ( 193 , 318) for EX , and 336 ( 268 , 403) for controls. A prespecified multivariate zero-inflated regression model suggested reduced incidence for MBSR ( p = 0.036) and lower global severity for EX ( p = 0.042) , compared to control , not quite attaining the p < 0.025 prespecified cut-off for null hypothesis rejection. There were 73 ARI-related missed-work days and 22 ARI-related health care visits in the MBSR group , 82 days and 21 visits for exercisers , and 105 days and 24 visits among controls. Viruses were identified in 63 ARI episodes in the MBSR group , compared to 64 for EX and 72 for control. Statistically significant ( p < 0.05) improvements in general mental health , self-efficacy , mindful attention , sleep quality , perceived stress , and depressive symptoms were observed in the MBSR and/or EX groups , compared to control. Training in mindfulness meditation or exercise may help protect against ARI illness. This trial was likely underpowered. Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01654289.
