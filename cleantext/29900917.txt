  The presence of furcation involvement represents a formidable problem in the treatment of periodontal<disease> disease<disease> Advances in radiographic analysis such as radiovisuographic ( RVG) aid in the early diagnosis and treatment planning , which is critical for long-term success. The present investigation aims to correlate the interdental and interradicular bone loss in chronic periodontitis<disease> patients so as to explore the potential of interdental bone loss as a rough approximate screening tool for early furcation diagnosis in mandibular first molar. RVG radiographs with furcation radiolucency in mandibular first molars were selected. The morphometric measurements of mesial , distal interdental bone loss , and interradicular bone loss in mandibular first molars were recorded using RVG. The correlation between mesial and distal interdental bone loss and interradicular bone loss was analyzed. In this retrospective investigation , it was observed that distal interdental bone loss was not significantly different when compared with mesial interdental bone loss. The interradicular bone loss was significantly different when compared with mesial interdental bone loss , whereas on analysis between distal interdental bone loss and interradicular bone loss was also found to be statistically significant. Interdental bone loss was found to be associated with progressive bone destruction in furcation area which suggests that early detection of interdental bone loss can be helpful in predicting future interradicular bone loss.
