  Finding patients at risk of developing contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( CI-AKI) is important because of its associated complications. In the present study , the contribution of different variables , such as the presence of metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) , the volume creatinine clearance ( V/CrCl) ratio , the iodine-dose ( I-dose)/ CrCl ratio , or hypertension , to CI-AKI was evaluated. A total of 255 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography with or without intervention were enrolled and divided into a MetS and a control group. All patients were assessed for the development of CI-AKI after the procedures. CI-AKI occurred in 39.23 % ( 51 of 130) of the MetS patients and 14.4 % ( 18 of 125) of the control group ( p < 0.001). The multivariable regression model showed that male sex and the use of statins decreased the risk of CI-AKI , and high triglyceride levels , I-dose/CrCl > 0.52 , MetS , CrCl ≤ 60 mL/min , and age ≥ 70 years increased the risk of CI-AKI , independent of confounding factors. The difference in the mean V/CrCl ratio was statistically significant between patients who developed CI-AKI and those who did not show renal impairment ( 2.36 ± 1.35 vs. 1.43 ± 0.89 , respectively; p < 0.001). The ROC curve analysis of I-dose/CrCl determined the best cutoff value for patients with and those without MetS as 0.51 and 0.63 , with a sensitivity value of 68 and 72 % and a specificity value of 73 and 74 % , respectively. We showed that MetS is a strong risk factor for CI-AKI in nondiabetic patients undergoing elective coronary interventions; and the I-dose/CrCl ratio is a strong predictor of CI-AKI in these patients. We suggest that clinicians identify MetS patients and calculate their I-dose/CrCl ratio before coronary interventions.
