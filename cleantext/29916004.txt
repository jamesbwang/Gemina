  There has been a substantial improvement in treatment options for rheumatic diseases due to the approval of many new drugs. This general trend is also observable in rare diseases , which are predominant in the field of vasculitis and collagenosis , albeit in a lesser form; however , the usually high costs of new drugs lead to increased scrutiny of prescriptions by health insurances. Many of the medications used do not have an official approval for these indications , so that use outside the approval , a so-called off-label use , must often be strived for. Whereas this often does not occur with conventional immunosuppressive drugs due to the comparatively low risk of recourse , in many situations cost coverage for an off-label use should be requested in advance for biologicals.
