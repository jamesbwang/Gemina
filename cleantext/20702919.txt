  Heart Rate Variability ( HRV) is an important tool for the analysis of a patient & rsquo; s physiological conditions , as well a method aiding the diagnosis of cardiopathies. Photoplethysmography ( PPG) is an optical technique applied in the monitoring of the HRV and its adoption has been growing significantly , compared to the most commonly used method in medicine , Electrocardiography ( ECG). In this survey , definitions of these technique are presented , the different types of sensors used are explained , and the methods for the study and analysis of the PPG signal ( linear and nonlinear methods) are described. Moreover , the progress , and the clinical and practical applicability of the PPG technique in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases are evaluated. In addition , the latest technologies utilized in the development of new tools for medical diagnosis are presented , such as Internet of Things , Internet of Health Things , genetic algorithms , artificial intelligence and biosensors which result in personalized advances in e-health and health care. After the study of these technologies , it can be noted that PPG associated with them is an important tool for the diagnosis of some diseases , due to its simplicity , its cost ‚Åª benefit ratio , the easiness of signals acquisition , and especially because it is a non-invasive technique.
