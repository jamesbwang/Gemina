  Over a 74-month period ( âˆ¼ 6 years) , 143 lower-extremity osteomyelitis<disease> locations in 125 patients were treated with a calcium sulfate/hydroxyapatite liquid bone void filler with antibiotic ( s). The osteomyelitis<disease> locations were treated with a percutaneous antibiotic delivery technique delivering intraosseous antibiotic followed by either oral or intravenous antibiotics for 4 weeks. There was no recurrence of osteomyelitis<disease> in 96.15 % of the treatable patients. Outcomes classified by the Cierny-Mader clinical classification are discussed as well. A bone void filler with antibiotic ( s) using the percutaneous antibiotic delivery technique is a safe , reliable , and effective means to treat lower-extremity osteomyelitis<disease> with either oral or intravenous antibiotics for 4 weeks.
