  S-Nitrosothiols , a class of NO donors , demonstrate potential benefits for cardiovascular diseases. Drugs for such chronic<disease> diseases<disease> require long term administration preferentially through the oral route. However , the absorption of S-nitrosothiols by the intestine , which is the first limiting barrier for their vascular bioavailability , is rarely evaluated. Using an in vitro model of intestinal barrier , based on human cells , the present work aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of intestinal transport ( passive or active , paracellular or transcellular pathway) and at predicting the absorption site of three S-nitrosothiols: S-nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO) , S-nitroso-N-acetyl-l-cysteine ( NACNO) and S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d-penicillamine ( SNAP). These S-nitrosothiols include different skeletons carrying the nitroso group , which confer different physico-chemical characteristics and biological activities ( antioxidant and anti-inflammatory). According to the values of apparent permeability coefficient , the three S-nitrosothiols belong to the medium class of permeability. The evaluation of the bidirectional apparent permeability demonstrated a passive diffusion of the three S-nitrosothiols. GSNO and NACNO preferentially cross the intestinal barrier though the transcellular pathway , while SNAP followed both the trans- and paracellular pathways. Finally , the permeability of NACNO was favoured at pH 6.4 , which is close to the pH of the jejunal part of the intestine. Through this study , we determined the absorption mechanisms of S-nitrosothiols and postulated that they can be administrated through the oral route.
