  Classic physical interventions for cervical dystonia ( CD) have focused on treating motor components or , on motor components and relaxation programs. However , no CD treatment study has focused on a relaxation program alone. We developed a pilot study to assess whether a therapy completely based on a relaxation program could improve the physical and mental symptomatologies of patients with CD. Fifteen persons were included in the experimental group , which received individual sessions of aquatic ( Watsu) therapy ( WT) and autogenic training ( AT). In addition , 12 persons were included in passive control group. We administered different questionnaires related to quality of life ( SF-36) , pain ( Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis<symptom> Rating Scale ( TWSTRS) and Visual Analog Scale ( VAS)) and mood ( Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory ( BDI-II) and State-Trait Anxiety<symptom> Inventory ( STAI)). A significant interaction was observed between treatment and time with regard to the SF-36 , VAS , and TWSTRS within the experimental group ( p < 0.01). The BDI-II showed depression<symptom> decrease as a simple effect ( p < 0.05) , and the STAI did not change. No effects were found with regard to the control group. In this exploratory study , we found that a therapy based on whole body relaxation improved the symptoms of patients with CD. This knowledge enables a disease-management strategy that uses a holistic perspective and moves beyond the dystonic focus.
