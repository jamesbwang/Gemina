  In this retrospective study , we evaluated the impact of CD56 , CD117 , and CD28 expression on clinical characteristics and survival in newly diagnosed myeloma patients treated with bortezomib-based induction therapy. We analyzed 110 myeloma patients. Immunophenotype was determined using panels consisting of CD19/CD38/CD45/ CD56/CD138 and CD20 , CD28 , and CD117 were used additionally. All samples were tested for recurrent chromosomal aberrations. CD56 , CD117 , and CD28 expression rates were 71 , 6 , and 68 % , respectively. The lack of CD56 expression was associated with light chain myeloma. The lack of CD117 expression was associated with elevated creatinine levels ( p = 0.037). We discovered the correlation between CD 28 expression and female gender. The median progression-free survival ( PFS) for patients with revised International Staging System stage 2 disease with CD56 expression or the lack of CD56 expression was 20.5 vs. 13.8 months ( p = 0.03). In patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( aHSCT) , we found no difference in PFS and overall survival regarding the CD56 expression. We found no impact of CD117 and CD28 expression on PFS in patients regarding aHSCT. Induction treatment incorporating bortezomib diminishes the negative impact of the lack of CD117 expression and aberrancy of CD28 but does not overcome the negative impact of the lack of CD56 expression.
