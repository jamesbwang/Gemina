  People with biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis<disease> ( GN) as their cause of end-stage kidney disease ( ESKD) who undergo kidney transplantation incur significant risk of recurrent GN-related graft failure , but the risk in recipients with ESKD where GN was suspected but not biopsy proven ( presumed/advanced GN) and when the cause of ESKD is unknown remains uncertain. Using the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant registry , we examined the associations between primary kidney transplant recipients whose ESKD was attributed to: 1) commonly-recurring GN ( i.e. IgA nephropathy , membranoproliferative GN , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membranous GN) , 2) presumed/advanced GN , and 3) cause of ESKD unknown ( uESKD) and GN-related graft failure using adjusted competing risk models. Of 5258 recipients followed for a median of 8 years , 3539 ( 67.3 %) had commonly-recurring GN , 1195 ( 22.7 %) presumed/advanced GN , and 524 ( 10.0 %) uESKD. Compared to recipients with commonly-recurring GN , recipients with presumed/advanced GN or uESKD experienced a low incidence of GN-related graft failure ( < 1 %) and a lower hazard of GN-related graft failure ( adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio ( HR) 0.28 ( 95 % CI 0.15-0.54 , p < 0.001) and 0.20 ( 95 % CI 0.06-0.64 , p = 0.007) , respectively). People with ESKD attributed to either presumed/advanced GN or unknown cause face a very low risk of graft failure secondary to GN recurrence after transplantation.
