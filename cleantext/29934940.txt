  Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel are recommended as adjuncts to fibrinolytic-treated patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI). However , the role of switching to ticagrelor within 24 h of fibrinolytics compared with clopidogrel continuation in this setting is uncertain. Hence , we conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases for all randomized clinical trials ( RCTs) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel after fibrinolytic therapy in patients with STEMI. A random-effects model was used to calculate the risk ratios ( RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). A total of 5 RCTs that evaluated the efficacy of ticagrelor post-fibrinolysis were identified. We included 3 RCTs with 3999 total patients for our meta-analysis. The results showed similar short-term clinical outcomes between ticagrelor and clopidogrel with regard to rates of Bleeding Academic Research Consortium ( BARC) type â‰¥ 2 bleeding ( RR 0.94; 95 % CI 0.56-1.60; P = 0.83) , major adverse cardiovascular events ( RR 0.87; 95 % CI 0.49-1.52; P = 0.62) , mortality ( RR 0.92; 95 % CI 0.53-1.59; P = 0.77) , myocardial infarction ( RR 0.76; 95 % CI 0.43-1.36; P = 0.36) , and stroke ( RR 0.93; 95 % CI 0.50-1.73; P = 0.82). Our results demonstrate that in STEMI patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy , switching to ticagrelor was associated with similar bleeding and ischemic outcomes compared with clopidogrel continuation.
