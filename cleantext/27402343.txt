  The level of pain perception is correlated with the magnitude of pain-evoked brain responses , such as laser-evoked potentials ( LEP) , across trials. The positive LEP-pain relationship lays the foundation for pain prediction based on single-trial LEP , but cross-individual pain prediction does not have a good performance because the LEP-pain relationship exhibits substantial cross-individual difference. In this study , we aim to explain the cross-individual difference in the LEP-pain relationship using inter-stimulus EEG ( isEEG) features. The isEEG features ( root mean square as magnitude and mean square successive difference as temporal variability) were estimated from isEEG data ( at full band and five frequency bands) recorded between painful stimuli. A linear model was fitted to investigate the relationship between pain ratings and LEP response for fast-pain trials on a trial-by-trial basis. Then the correlation between isEEG features and the parameters of LEP-pain model ( slope and intercept) was evaluated. We found that the magnitude and temporal variability of isEEG could modulate the parameters of an individual 's linear LEP-pain model for fast-pain trials. Based on this , we further developed a new individualized fast-pain prediction scheme , which only used training individuals with similar isEEG features as the test individual to train the fast-pain prediction model , and obtained improved accuracy in cross-individual fast-pain prediction. The findings could help elucidate the neural mechanism of cross-individual difference in pain experience and the proposed fast-pain prediction scheme could be potentially used as a practical and feasible pain prediction method in clinical practice.
