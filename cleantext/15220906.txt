  Cor-triatriatum is uncommon and cor-triatriatum dexter is rarer , and patients may remain asymptomatic in isolated cases especially if the partitioning is mild and nonobstructing. There may be other cardiac defects associated with it which are mostly right-sided cardiac defects such as atrial septal defect , Ebstein anomaly , and pulmonary stenosis. However , left-sided heart anomaly such as aortic regurgitation has been associated with it , but its association with transposition of the great vessels has not been documented before now. Therefore , the case of a 3-month-old girl with cor-triatriatum dexter with transposition of the great vessels , and atrial septal defect is reported.
