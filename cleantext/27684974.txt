  Cytomegalovirus ( CMV)- induced pseudotumors , or mass-like lesions<symptom> in the colon , are a rare entity. We report a case of CMV-related spindle cell pseudotumor in an immunocompetent patient with a left ventricular assist device. This case highlights the importance of considering CMV-induced inflammatory pseudotumor when evaluating tumorous lesions<symptom> in the colon , as well as the importance of appropriate diagnostic work-up , including proper biopsy technique and meticulous review of the pathology.
