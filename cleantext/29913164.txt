  Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders ( NMOSD) are a group of autoimmune astrocytopathies in the central nervous system , which are mainly caused by immunoglobulin G ( IgG) against astrocyte water channel aquaporin-4 ( AQP4). In this study , we aimed to establish a model of NMOSD-related optic neuritis ( NMOSD-ON) and to evaluate the progressive<symptom> changes<symptom> of the optic nerve and visual function. AQP4 IgG-positive serum from NMOSD patients was injected into the subarachnoid space of the rat optic nerve to induce the NMOSD-ON model ( AQP4 + group) , and healthy serum was injected as the control. The visual evoked potential , pupillary light reflex and optical coherence tomography were monitored every week for 3 weeks after induction. Compared with the control group , the amplitude of the N1-P1 peak and pupillary light reflex in the AQP4 + group were reduced within the first week and then remained low thereafter. Consistent with the functional deficits , the thickness of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer in the AQP4 + group was also greatly reduced. At the end of 3 weeks , there was a loss of retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerves showed characteristic NMOSD-like pathologic changes , including deposition of AQP4 IgG , local astrocyte damage , demyelination , microglia activation , macrophage infiltration and axonal injury. Thus , we have established an NMOSD-ON rat model with deficits in the optic nerve and visual function that may be a valuable tool for exploring the mechanism of NMOSD-ON and evaluating its potential therapeutic treatment.
