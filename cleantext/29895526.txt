  Activation of cyclin-dependent kinase activity is frequently observed in many human cancers; therefore , cyclin-dependent kinases that promote cell cycle transition and cell proliferation may be potential targets in the treatment of malignancy. The therapeutic effects of roniciclib , a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor for papillary and follicular thyroid cancer ( designated as well-differentiated thyroid cancer) , were investigated in this study. Roniciclib inhibited cell proliferation in two papillary and two follicular thyroid cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Roniciclib activated caspase-3 activity and induced apoptosis. Cell cycle progression was arrested in the G2/M phase. Roniciclib treatment
