  MapReduce ( MR) computing paradigm and its open source implementation Hadoop have become a de facto standard to process big data in a distributed environment. Initially , the Hadoop system was homogeneous in three significant aspects , namely , user , workload , and cluster ( hardware). However , with growing variety of MR jobs and inclusion of different configurations of nodes in the existing cluster , heterogeneity has become an essential part of Hadoop systems. The heterogeneity factors adversely affect the performance of a Hadoop scheduler and limit the overall throughput of the system. To overcome this problem , various heterogeneous Hadoop schedulers have been proposed in the literature. Existing survey works in this area mostly cover homogeneous schedulers and classify them on the basis of quality of service parameters they optimize. Hence , there is a need to study the heterogeneous Hadoop schedulers on the basis of various heterogeneity factors considered by them. In this survey article , we first discuss different heterogeneity factors that typically exist in a Hadoop system and then explore various challenges that arise while designing the schedulers in the presence of such heterogeneity. Afterward , we present the comparative study of heterogeneous scheduling algorithms available in the literature and classify them by the previously said heterogeneity factors. Lastly , we investigate different methods and environment used for evaluation of discussed Hadoop schedulers.
