  This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) mutation and clinical outcomes in patients with stage III non-squamous cell lung cancer treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT). From January 2008 to December 2013 , the medical records of 197 patients with stage III non- squamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) treated with definitive CCRT were analyzed to determine progression free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) according to EGFR mutation status. Among 197 eligible patients , 81 patients were EGFR wild type , 36 patients had an EGFR mutation ( exon 19 Del: 18; L858R: 9 , Uncommon ( G719X , L868 , T790M): 9) , and 80 patients had unknown EGFR status. The median age was 59 years ( range: 28- 80) and 136 ( 69.0 %) patients were male. The median follow-up duration was 66.5 months ( range: 1.9- 114.5). One hundred sixty-four patients ( 83.2 %) experienced disease progression. Median PFS was 8.9 months for the EGFR mutation group , 11.8 months for EGFR wild type , and 10.5 months for the unknown EGFR group ( p = 0.013 , p = 0.042). The most common site of metastasis in the EGFR mutant group was the brain. However , there was no significant difference in overall survival among the three groups ( 34.6 months for EGFR mutant group vs. 31.9 months for EGFR wild type vs. 22.6 months for EGFR unknown group , p = 0.792 , p = 0.284). A total of 29 ( 80.6 %) patients with EGFR mutation were treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI) s ( gefitinib: 24 , erlotinib: 3 , afatinib: 2) upon progression. EGFR mutation is associated with short PFS and the brain is the most common site of distant metastasis in patients with stage III non- squamous cell lung cancer treated with CCRT.
