  Viral suppression is a primary marker of HIV<pathogen> treatment success. Persons with HIV<pathogen> are at increased risk for AIDS-defining cancer ( ADC) and several types of non-AIDS-defining cancer ( NADC) , some of which are caused by oncogenic viruses. To determine whether viral suppression is associated with decreased cancer risk. Prospective cohort. Department of Veterans Affairs. HIV-positive veterans ( n = 42 441) and demographically matched uninfected veterans ( n = 104 712) from 1999 to 2015. Standardized cancer incidence rates and Poisson regression rate ratios ( RRs; HIV-positive vs. uninfected persons) by viral suppression status ( unsuppressed: person-time with HIV<pathogen> RNA levels â‰¥ 500 copies/mL; early suppression: initial 2 years with HIV<pathogen> RNA levels < 500 copies/mL; long-term suppression: person-time after early suppression with HIV<pathogen> RNA levels < 500 copies/mL). Cancer incidence for HIV-positive versus uninfected persons was highest for unsuppressed persons ( RR , 2.35 ( 95 % CI , 2.19 to 2.51)) , lower among persons with early suppression ( RR , 1.99 ( CI , 1.87 to 2.12)) , and lowest among persons with long-term suppression ( RR , 1.52 ( CI , 1.44 to 1.61)). This trend was strongest for ADC ( unsuppressed: RR , 22.73 ( CI , 19.01 to 27.19); early suppression: RR , 9.48 ( CI , 7.78 to 11.55); long-term suppression: RR , 2.22 ( CI , 1.69 to 2.93)) , much weaker for NADC caused by viruses ( unsuppressed: RR , 3.82 ( CI , 3.24 to 4.49); early suppression: RR , 3.42 ( CI , 2.95 to 3.97); long-term suppression: RR , 3.17 ( CI , 2.78 to 3.62)) , and absent for NADC not caused by viruses. Lower viral suppression thresholds , duration of long-term suppression , and effects of CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell counts were not thoroughly evaluated. Antiretroviral therapy resulting in long-term viral suppression may contribute to cancer prevention , to a greater degree for ADC than for NADC. Patients with long-term viral suppression still had excess cancer risk. National Cancer Institute and National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health.
