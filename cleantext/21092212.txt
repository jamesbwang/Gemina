  The burden of non-communicable diseases ( NCDs) is increasing in Ethiopia. This study aims to describe the prevalence of NCD risk factors of public employees in a regional city in northern Ethiopia. We conducted a cross-sectional epidemiological study targeting men and women aged 25-64 years employed by public offices in Mekelle. The prevalence was age-standardized to the Ethiopian 2007 population. Among the 1380 subjects ( 823 men and 557 women) , 68.7 % had less than 1 serving of fruits and vegetables per day , 41.0 % were physically inactive , and 57.3 % observed religious fast. The age-standardised prevalence of abdominal obesity was 29.3 % in men and 58.5 % in women , but that of metabolic syndrome<disease> was comparable between men ( 39.2 %) and women ( 39.0 %). The prevalence of diabetes was underestimated if only fasting blood glucose ( FBG) was used for the diagnosis compared to combination of FBG and glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c) ( 6.7 % in men and 3.8 % in women vs. 12.1 % in men and 5.6 % in women). More than a quarter ( 26.1 %) of men and 8.7 % of women had estimated 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 10 % or more. This study revealed the high prevalence of NCD metabolic risk factors among the urban public employees in the highland of Ethiopia.
