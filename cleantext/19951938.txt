  We estimated small arterial elasticity<pathogen> and used linear regression<pathogen> to evaluate its association<pathogen> with inflammatory biomarkers<pathogen> among antiretroviral therapy-na√Øve , HIV-positive patients<pathogen> with high CD4<pathogen> + counts<pathogen>. After adjustment<pathogen> , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein<pathogen> and interleukin-6<pathogen> were inversely associated with small arterial elasticity<pathogen>. These data<pathogen> suggest that systemic inflammation<pathogen> may contribute to vascular dysfunction<pathogen> even in very early
