  An ultrasensitive strain sensor with a wide strain range based on graphene armour scales is demonstrated in this paper. The sensor shows an ultra-high gauge factor ( GF , up to 1054) and a wide strain range ( Îµ = 26 %) , both of which present an advantage compared to most other flexible sensors. Moreover , the sensor is developed by a simple fabrication process. Due to the excellent performance , this strain sensor can meet the demands of subtle , large and complex human motion monitoring , which indicates its tremendous application potential in health monitoring , mechanical control , real-time motion monitoring and so on.
