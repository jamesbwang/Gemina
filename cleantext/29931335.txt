  1) Examine performance on an objective measure of reward-related cognitive impulsivity ( delay discounting) among self-reported habitual short sleepers and medium ( i.e. , recommended 7-9 hours) length sleepers either reporting or not reporting daytime dysfunction; 2) Inform the debate regarding what type and duration of short sleep ( e.g. , 21 to 24 hours of total sleep deprivation , self-reported habitual short sleep duration) meaningfully influences cognitive impulsivity; 3) Compare the predictive utility of sleep duration and perceived dysfunction to other factors previously shown to influence cognitive impulsivity via delay discounting performance ( age , income , education , and fluid intelligence). We analyzed data from 1,190 adults from the Human Connectome Project database. Participants were grouped on whether they reported habitual short ( â‰¤ 6 hours) vs. medium length ( 7-9 hours) sleep duration and whether they perceived daytime dysfunction using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. All short sleepers exhibited increased delay discounting compared to all medium length sleepers , regardless of perceived dysfunction. Of the variables examined , self-reported sleep duration was the strongest predictor of delay discounting behavior between groups and across all 1,190 participants. Individuals who report habitual short sleep are likely to exhibit increased reward-related cognitive impulsivity regardless of perceived sleep-related daytime impairment. Therefore , there is reason to suspect that these individuals exhibit more daytime dysfunction , in the form of reward-related cognitive impulsivity , than they may assume. Current findings suggest that assessment of sleep duration over the prior month has meaningful predictive utility for human reward-related impulsivity.
