  The NF2 gene encodes the tumor and metastasis suppressor protein Merlin. Merlin exerts its tumor suppressive role by inhibiting proliferation and inducing contact-growth inhibition and apoptosis. In the current investigation , we determined that loss of Merlin in breast cancer tissues is concordant with the loss of the inhibitory SMAD , SMAD7 , of the TGF-β pathway. This was reflected as dysregulated activation of TGF-β signaling that co-operatively engaged with effectors of the Hippo pathway ( YAP/TAZ/TEAD). As a consequence , the loss of Merlin in breast cancer resulted in a significant metabolic and bioenergetic adaptation of cells characterized by increased aerobic glycolysis and decreased oxygen consumption. Mechanistically , we determined that the co-operative activity of the Hippo and TGF-β transcription effectors caused upregulation of the long non-coding RNA Urothelial Cancer-Associated 1 ( UCA1) that disengaged Merlin 's check on STAT3 activity. The consequent upregulation of Hexokinase 2 ( HK2) enabled a metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis. In fact , Merlin deficiency engendered cellular dependence on this metabolic adaptation , endorsing a critical role for Merlin in regulating cellular metabolism. This is the first report of Merlin functioning as a molecular restraint on cellular metabolism. Thus , breast cancer patients whose tumors demonstrate concordant loss of Merlin and SMAD7 may benefit from an approach of incorporating STAT3 inhibitors.
