  The axioms of stereoelectronic theory constitute an atlas to navigate the contours of molecular space. All too rarely lauded , the advent and development of stereoelectronic theory has been one of organic chemistry 's greatest triumphs. Inevitably , however , in the absence of a comprehensive treatise , many of the field 's pioneers do not receive the veneration that they merit. Rather their legacies are the stereoelectronic pillars that persist in teaching and research. This ubiquity continues to afford practitioners of organic chemistry with an abundance of opportunities for creative endeavor in reaction design , in conceiving novel activation modes , in preorganizing intermediates , or in stabilizing productive transition states and products. Antipodal to steric governance , which mitigates destabilizing nonbonding interactions , stereoelectronic control allows well-defined , often complementary , conformations to be populated. Indeed , the prevalence of stabilizing hyperconjugative interactions in biosynthetic processes renders this approach to molecular preorganization decidedly biomimetic and , by extension , expansive. In this Account , the evolution and application of a simple donor-acceptor model based on the fluorine gauche effect is delineated. Founded on reinforcing hyperconjugative interactions involving C ( sp
