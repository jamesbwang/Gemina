  To evaluate the management and outcomes of naïve bilateral retinoblastoma treated at a single-center over a 5-year period during the era of ophthalmic artery chemosurgery ( OAC) and intravitreous chemotherapy. Retrospective cohort study of 46 patients ( 92 eyes) with naïve bilateral retinoblastoma treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between January 2012 and February 2017. Indirect ophthalmoscopy , fundus photography , ultrasonography , and ultrasonic biomicroscopy were used to evaluate clinical response. Patient , ocular , ocular progression-free , ocular recurrent event-free , and second ocular survivals were assessed by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Retinal toxicity was evaluated by electroretinography. Snellen visual acuity and complete blood count metrics were recorded. Sixty-four eyes ( 70 %) in 41 patients ( 89 %) received ophthalmic artery chemosurgery as part of their treatment. Twenty-six patients ( 56 %) received tandem OAC ( bilateral simultaneous infusions). Seven eyes were primarily enucleated. No eye receiving initial OAC was enucleated. There was a single secondary enucleation in an eye initially treated with focal therapy with anterior chamber recurrence. The 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall ocular , secondary ocular ( survival after treatment for recurrence) , progression-free , and recurrent event-free survival were 91.3 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 83.4-95.5) , 98.7 % ( 95 % CI 91.3-99.8) , 91.5 % ( 95 % CI 83.0-95.8) , and 78.9 % ( 95 % CI 68.2-86.3) , respectively. Overall and secondary ocular survivals were 100 % for International Classification of Retinoblastoma ( ICRB) groups A-C. Overall ocular survival was 91.5 % ( 95 % CI 70-97.8) for ICRB group D and 71.4 % ( 95 % CI 47.1-79.4) for group E. Secondary ocular survival was 95.4 % ( 95 % CI 71.8-99.3) for ICRB group D and 100 % for group E. There were no treatment-related deaths , three patients developed trilateral retinoblastoma ( one died) , and one patient ( who did not receive OAC) developed metastatic disease and is in remission at 32-month follow-up. The majority ( 89 %) of bilateral retinoblastoma patients in the current era and at this center were treated with OAC. This has resulted in saving a historic number of eyes. A quarter of eyes developed recurrent disease ( defined as recurrent disease requiring any treatment including focal) , the majority of which occurred in the first year after treatment , and all but one was saved. There has been no compromise in patient survival.
