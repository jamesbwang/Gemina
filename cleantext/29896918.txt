  To examine the prevalence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD) in a sample of prison employees , investigate risk factors , and explore protective factors for PTSD. We surveyed 355 Washington State Department of Corrections employees. The survey included the PTSD checklist for the DSM-5 ( PCL-5) , the Critical Incident History Questionnaire , and the Work Environment Inventory. We found 19 % of the sample met the criteria for diagnosable PTSD. Several risk factors were associated with a higher PCL-5 score , including exposure to critical incidents , and having greater ambiguity in the job role. Being happy with job assignments and having positive relationships with supervisors and coworkers were associated with decreased PCL-5 score. Prison employees have a PTSD rate equivalent to Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans and higher than police officers , suggesting the importance of developing programs for promoting resilience to stress , incorporating the knowledge gained on risk , and protective factors.
