  Tip cells , the leading cells of angiogenic sprouts , were identified in cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) by using CD34 as a marker. Here , we show that tip cells are also present in primary human microvascular endothelial cells ( hMVECs) , a more relevant endothelial cell type for angiogenesis. By means of flow cytometry , immunocytochemistry , and qPCR , it is shown that endothelial cell cultures contain a dynamic population of CD34
