  Periodic episodes of excessive alcohol consumption ( `` binge drinking '') occur frequently among adolescents , and early binge drinking is associated with an increased risk of alcohol use disorders later in life. The PFC undergoes significant development during adolescence and hence may be especially susceptible to the effects of binge drinking. In humans and in animal models , adolescent alcohol exposure is known to alter PFC neuronal activity and produce deficits in PFC-dependent behaviors , such as decision making , response inhibition , and working memory. Using a voluntary intermittent access to alcohol ( IA EtOH) procedure in male mice , we demonstrate that binge-level alcohol consumption during adolescence leads to altered drinking patterns and working memory deficits in young adulthood , two outcomes that suggest medial PFC dysfunction. We recorded from pyramidal neurons ( PNs) in the prelimbic subregion of the medial PFC in slices obtained from mice that had IA EtOH and found that they display altered excitability , including a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and reductions in the hyperpolarization-activated cation current ( I
