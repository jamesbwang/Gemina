  This study aim was to examine whether the presence of untreated caries<disease> is different across occupational status among Japanese adults. This was a cross-sectional survey of 1,342 individuals ( 990 males and 352 females) aged 40-64 years who underwent medical and dental checkups at a healthcare center in 2011. Oral examination was performed by a dentist and the presence of untreated caries<disease> was defined as having at least one untreated decayed tooth. Data regarding current occupational status were obtained using a self-administered questionnaire; the participants were classified into five groups: professionals and managers , clerical and related workers , service and salespersons , agricultural , forestry , and fishery workers , and homemakers and unemployed. Gender-specific odds ratios ( ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) of occupational status for the presence of untreated caries<disease> were estimated using logistic regression. After adjusting for potential confounders , female professionals and managers ( OR = 3.51 , 95 % CI = 1.04-11.87) and service and salespersons ( OR = 5.29 , 95 % CI = 1.39-20.11) had greater risks of the presence of untreated caries<disease> than female homemakers and unemployed. However , this tendency was not observed among males. In conclusion , there was a significant difference in risk of the presence of untreated caries<disease> by occupational status among females.
