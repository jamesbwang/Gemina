  Target Of Rapamycin Complex 2 ( TORC2) is a widely conserved serine/threonine protein kinase. In the yeast Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> , TORC2 is essential , playing a key role in plasma membrane homeostasis. In this role , TORC2 regulates diverse processes , including sphingolipid synthesis , glycerol production and efflux , polarization of the actin cytoskeleton , and endocytosis. The major direct substrate of TORC2 is the AGC-family kinase Ypk1. Ypk1 connects TORC2 signaling to actin polarization and to endocytosis via the flippase kinases Fpk1 and Fpk2. Here , we report that Fpk1 mediates TORC2 signaling to control actin polarization , but not endocytosis , via aminophospholipid flippases. To search for specific targets of these flippase kinases , we exploited the fact that Fpk1 prefers to phosphorylate Ser residues within the sequence RXS ( L/Y) ( D/E) , which is present ~ 90 times in the yeast proteome. We observed that 25 of these sequences are phosphorylated by Fpk1 in vitro. We focused on one sequence hit , the Ark/Prk family kinase Akl1 , as this kinase previously has been implicated in endocytosis. Using a potent ATP-competitive small molecule , CMB4563 , to preferentially inhibit TORC2 , we found that Fpk1-mediated Akl1 phosphorylation inhibits Akl1 activity , which , in turn , reduces phosphorylation of Pan1 and of other endocytic coat proteins , and ultimately contributes to a slowing of endocytosis kinetics. These results indicate that the regulation of actin polarization and endocytosis downstream of TORC2 is signaled through separate pathways that bifurcate at the level of the flippase kinases.
