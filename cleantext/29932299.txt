  Our ability to deal with abstract concepts is one of the most intriguing faculties of human cognition. Still , we know little about how such concepts are formed , processed , and represented in mind. For example , because abstract concepts do not designate referents that can be experienced through our body , the role of perceptual experiences in shaping their content remains controversial. Current theories suggest a variety of alternative explanations to the question of `` how abstract concepts are represented in the human mind. '' These views pinpoint specific streams of semantic information that would play a prominent role in shaping the content of abstract concepts , such as situation-based information ( e.g. , Barsalou & Wiemer-Hastings ,) , affective information ( Kousta , Vigliocco , Vinson , Andrews , & Del Campo ,) , and linguistic information ( Louwerse ,). Rarely , these theoretical views are directly compared. In this special issue , current views are presented in their most recent and advanced form , and directly compared and discussed in a debate , which is reported at the end of each article. As a result , new exciting questions and challenges arise. These questions and challenges , reported in this introductory article , can arguably pave the way to new empirical studies and theoretical developments on the nature of abstract concepts.
