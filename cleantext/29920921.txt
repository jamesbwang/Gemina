  Cloning of genes encoding the luciferase from Photobacterium<pathogen> leiognathi YL in Escherichia<pathogen> coli Rosetta ( DE3) was performed successfully and the expressed forms of lux AB were purified to homogeneity. Experimental measurements revealed that luciferase from Photobacterium<pathogen> leiognathi YL has good thermal stability and a high residual activity at extreme pH values , which are extremely important for its various ecological , industrial and medical applications. Furthermore , we made a first attempt for quantitative detection of NADH by recombinant E coli Rosetta ( DE3) coupled enzyme system. A good linear relationship between luminescence intensity and NADH with low ( 1-12 nmol/L) and high ( 10-500 nmol/L) concentration was observed , whose standard curve was y = 772.97 Ã— + 4041.1 , R
