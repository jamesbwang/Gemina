  The direct manipulation of individual atoms in materials using scanning probe microscopy has been a seminal achievement of nanotechnology. Recent advances in imaging resolution and sample stability have made scanning transmission electron microscopy a promising alternative for single-atom manipulation of covalently bound materials. Pioneering experiments using an atomically focused electron beam have demonstrated the directed movement of silicon atoms over a handful of sites within the graphene lattice. Here , we achieve a much greater degree of control , allowing us to precisely move silicon impurities along an extended path , circulating a single hexagon , or back and forth between the two graphene sublattices. Even with manual operation , our manipulation rate is already comparable to the state-of-the-art in any atomically precise technique. We further explore the influence of electron energy on the manipulation rate , supported by improved theoretical modeling taking into account the vibrations of atoms near the impurities , and implement feedback to detect manipulation events in real time. In addition to atomic-level engineering of its structure and properties , graphene also provides an excellent platform for refining the accuracy of quantitative models and for the development of automated manipulation.
