  The 3 direct-acting antiviral ( 3D) regimen of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir has recently been approved in several Asian geographic regions for the treatment of hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) genotype ( GT) 1 infection. The pharmacokinetics of the components of the 3D regimen with or without ribavirin were evaluated in healthy Chinese subjects and HCV<pathogen> GT1b-infected Chinese , South Korean , and Taiwanese patients , with or without cirrhosis , to determine how the drug exposures in Asian populations compare with historical data in Western populations. Participants received ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir 25/150/100 mg once daily plus dasabuvir 250 mg twice daily for 14 days ( healthy subjects , n = 36) or 12 weeks ( HCV<pathogen> patients , n = 754). Patients with compensated cirrhosis also received ribavirin 1000 or 1200 mg divided twice daily , per the local label. Intensive or sparse pharmacokinetic sampling was performed for assessments of plasma drug concentrations. The exposures ( maximum plasma concentration ( C Collectively , the results of these pharmacokinetic analyses support the use of the same dose of the 3D regimen for Asian and Western patients.
