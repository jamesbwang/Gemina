  This study explores understanding of primary and secondary prevention of anal cancer among human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>)- infected foreign-born Latino gay and bisexual men ( GBM). Between August 2015 and December 2016 , researchers conducted 33 in-depth , semi-structured interviews with HIV-infected foreign-born Latino GBM. Interview questions sought to determine participants ' knowledge and perceived barriers and facilitators to primary and secondary prevention of anal cancer. Researchers analyzed interview transcripts using a qualitative content analysis approach. For primary prevention , men reported a lack of knowledge about the human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) vaccine. However , for secondary prevention , roughly 60 % of participants had previously screened for anal dysplasia via anal Papanicolaou ( Pap) smear. However , participants reported willingness to screen , and provider recommendation was the most common screening facilitator. Men reported stigma related to their HIV<pathogen> status , sexual orientation , and anal Pap smear procedures as anal cancer screening barriers. Participants reported willingness to use a self-screening anal Pap smear test if it was commercially available. Health providers continue to be the leading source of health information. Therefore , provider recommendation for HPV<pathogen> vaccination and anal cancer screening among age-eligible foreign-born Latino HIV-infected GBM is critical. More work is needed to destigmatize HIV<pathogen> and sexual orientation to influence positive health behaviors among this population. Future intervention research could test the effects of provider-led interventions and also media campaigns aimed at influencing HPV<pathogen> vaccine uptake and anal cancer screening among this population.
