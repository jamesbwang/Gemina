  Wild-type p53 ( wtp53) is described as a tumour suppressor gene , and mutations in p53 occur in many human cancers. Indeed , in high-grade malignant glioma , numerous molecular genetics studies have established central roles of RTK-PI3K-PTEN and ARF-MDM2-p53 INK4a-RB pathways in promoting oncogenic capacity. Deregulation of these signalling pathways , among others , drives changes in the glial/stem cell state and environment that permit autonomous growth. The initially transformed cell may undergo subsequent modifications , acquiring a more complete tumour-initiating phenotype responsible for disease advancement to stages that are more aggressive. We recently established that the oncogenic activity of mutant p53 ( mtp53) is driven by the actin cytoskeleton-associated protein WIP ( WASP-interacting protein) , correlated with tumour growth , and more importantly that both proteins are responsible for the tumour-initiating cell phenotype. We reported that WIP knockdown in mtp53-expressing glioblastoma greatly reduced proliferation and growth capacity of cancer stem cell ( CSC)- like cells and decreased CSC-like markers , such as hyaluronic acid receptor ( CD44) , prominin-1 ( CD133) , yes-associated protein ( YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif ( TAZ). We thus propose a new CSC signalling pathway downstream of mtp53 in which Akt regulates WIP and controls YAP/TAZ stability. WIP drives a mechanism that stimulates growth signals , promoting YAP/TAZ and & beta;- catenin stability in a Hippo-independent fashion , which allows cells to coordinate processes such as proliferation , stemness and invasiveness , which are key factors in cancer progression. Based on this multistep tumourigenic model , it is tantalizing to propose that WIP inhibitors may be applied as an effective anti-cancer therapy.
