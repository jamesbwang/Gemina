  Purpose To determine whether multiple doses of gadobutrol increase the T1 signal intensity in the brains of children. Materials and Methods This retrospective imaging study evaluated 91 children ( median age , 5.4 years; age range , 0-17 years) with brain tumors who underwent five or more MR brain examinations at a single institution. A subgroup of 46 patients received five or more administrations of gadobutrol ( 0.1 mmol/kg) and underwent follow-up MRI. T1 signal intensity in the globus pallidus and dentate nucleus was measured at the first to sixth unenhanced MR brain examination in these children. Globus pallidus-to-corpus callosum and dentate nucleus-to-corpus callosum signal intensity ratios were analyzed by linear mixed-effect analysis. Subgroup analysis was performed for six children who underwent 14 or more administrations of gadobutrol. Results The globus pallidus-to-corpus callosum ratio increased with patient age ( absolute change , 0.0052 per year; 95 % confidence interval: 0.0033 , 0.0071; P < .0001). There was no change in the dentate nucleus-to-corpus callosum ratio with age ( P = .30). Among 46 children who received five or more doses of gadobutrol ( median dose , 11 mL; range , 3.9-31 mL) , there was no change in signal intensity ratio of the globus pallidus ( P = .17) or dentate nucleus ( P = .44). Among six children who underwent more than 14 administrations of gadobutrol ( median dose , 64 mL; range , 40-91 mL) there was no change in signal intensity ratio of the globus pallidus ( P = .15) or dentate nucleus ( P = .50). Conclusion No increase in T1-weighted signal intensity ratio was observed in the globus pallidus or dentate nucleus after the administration of at least five doses of gadobutrol.
