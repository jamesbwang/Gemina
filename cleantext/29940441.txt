  Raw wastewater can contain high levels of antibiotic resistance genes ( ARGs) , making municipal wastewater treatment plants ( WWTPs) critical for the control of the release of ARGs into the environment. The objective of this study was to investigate how individual treatment steps in two tertiary WWTPs affected the removal ( copies/mL) and relative abundance of ARGs ( copies/copies 16S rRNA genes). Nine ARG markers , representing resistance to commonly used antibiotics , as well as one integron gene ( intl1) to assess ARG mobility potential , were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR). Both WWTPs met provincial effluent regulations for removal of carbonaceous oxygen demand ( CBOD
