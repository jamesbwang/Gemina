  The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of different doses of tripterygium glycosides ( TG) in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy ( DN). The effect of TG on blood lipids and safety were also evaluated. Sixty patients with type 2 DN were randomly divided into three groups ( n = 20 per group): low-dose ( 30 mg/day TG) , double-dose ( 60 mg/day TG) and control ( placebo) groups , all three times daily for 6 months. The levels of triglycerides , total cholesterol , urinary protein , plasma albumin and serum tumour necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α were compared between the three groups. After treatment , urinary protein and TNF-α level significantly decreased in patients in the treatment groups , compared with the control group. This decrease was significantly larger in the double-dose group than in the low-dose group. However , there was no significant decrease in triglycerides and total cholesterol in the two treatment groups. Furthermore , plasma albumin was lower in the treatment groups than in the control group. The double dose of TG has improved clinical efficacy , compared with the low dose , and the same safety profile.
