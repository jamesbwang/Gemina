  To present refractive outcomes from consecutive cases with the Alcon Wavelight A retrospective chart review of consecutive cases of high myopic eyes ( â‰¥ 6.0 Diopters ( D)) undergoing PRK with the Alcon Wavelight EX500 excimer laser ( Alcon Laboratories , Fort Worth , TX , USA) was done. Moderately high myopic eyes ( 6.0 to < 8.0 D ( 6 D)) were compared with high myopic eyes ( 8.0 D or greater ( 8 D)). Outcomes measured included pre- and postoperative refractive error , uncorrected distance visual acuity ( UDVA) , corrected distance visual acuity , spherical equivalent correction ( SEQ) , haze incidence , and intraocular pressure ( IOP). One hundred eighteen eyes of 63 patients were evaluated , with 59 eyes having 12 months of follow-up. Thirty-one eyes of 19 patients had 8.0 D or more of myopia. Twelvemonth average LogMAR UDVA was -0.06 ( 20/17) for the 6 D group and -0.08 ( 20/16) for the 8 D group. Average 12-month SEQ was -0.18 D and preoperatively was -7.52 D for the 6 D group and -0.09 and -9.02 in the 8 D group. Sixty-five eyes ( 86 %) and 24 eyes ( 96 %) had an SEQ within 0.50 D of emmetropia at 3 months in the 6 and 8 D groups , respectively. One eye had visually significant haze developed at 8 months. Three eyes had IOP elevation that resolved with addition of short-term topical IOP-lowering medication. High myopic PRK with the Alcon Wavelight EX500 excimer laser yields excellent refractive outcomes with a low incidence of complications.
