  There is a growing consensus among researchers that a complete description of human attention and action should include information about how these processes are informed by social context. When we actively engage in co-action with others , there are characteristic changes in action kinematics , reaction time , search behavior , as well as other processes ( see Sebanz et al. , 2003; Becchio et al. , 2010; Wahn et al. , 2017). It is now important to identify precisely what is shared between co-actors in these joint action situations. One group recently found that participants seem to withdraw their attention away from a partner and toward themselves when co-engaged in a line bisection judgment task ( Szpak et al. , 2016). This effect runs counter to the typical finding that attention is drawn toward social items in the environment ( Birmingham et al. , 2008 , 2009; Foulsham et al. , 2011). As such , the result suggests that joint action can uniquely lead to the withdrawal of covert attention in a manner detectable by a line bisection task performed on a computer screen. This task could therefore act as a simple and elegant measure of interpersonal effects on attention within particular pairs of participants. For this reason , the present work attempted to replicate and extend the finding that attention , as measured by a line-bisection task , is withdrawn away from nearby co-actors. Overall our study found no evidence of social modulation of covert attention. This suggests that the line bisection task may not be sensitive enough to reliably measure interpersonal attention effects- at least when one looks at overall group performance. However , our data also hint at the possibility that the effect of nearby others on the distribution of attention may be modulated by individual differences.
