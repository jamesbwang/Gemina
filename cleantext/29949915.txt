  Cell-cell junctions are critical structures in a number of tissues for mechanically coupling cells together , cell-to-cell signaling , and establishing a barrier. In many tissues , desmosomes are an important component of cell-cell junctions. Loss or impairment of desmosomes presents with clinical phenotypes in the heart and skin as cardiac arrhythmias and skin blistering , respectively. Because heart and skin are tissues that are subject to large mechanical stresses , we hypothesized that desmosomes , similar to adherens junctions , would also experience significant tensile loading. To directly measure mechanical forces across desmosomes , we developed and validated a desmoglein-2 ( DSG-2) force sensor , using the existing TSmod F&ouml;rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET) force biosensor. When expressed in human cardiomyocytes , the force sensor reported high tensile loading of DSG-2 during contraction. Additionally , when expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney ( MDCK) epithelial or epidermal ( A431) monolayers , the sensor also reported tensile loading. Finally , we observed higher DSG-2 forces in 3D MDCK acini when compared to 2D monolayers. Taken together , our results show that desmosomes experience low levels of mechanical tension in resting cells , with significantly higher forces during active loading.
