  Staphylococcus<pathogen> lugdunensis<pathogen> is a commensal bacterium<pathogen> that can cause serious infection suggesting an ability to circumvent aspects of host immunity. We demonstrate here that macrophages fail to kill ingested S.<pathogen> lugdunensis<pathogen> and the bacteria persist for extended periods , without replicating , within mature LAMP-1-positive phagolysosomes. Phagocytosed S.<pathogen> lugdunensis<pathogen> also do not intoxicate host cells in contrast to S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. Optimal survival of S.<pathogen> lugdunensis<pathogen> requires O-acetylated peptidoglycan since an oatA mutant , which is more sensitive to killing by lysozyme than WT , survived to a lesser extent in macrophages. In vitro models of macrophage infection reveal that viable intracellular S.<pathogen> lugdunensis<pathogen> bacteria can be made to grow by pharmacologic perturbation of phagosome function or by phagocyte intoxication by S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> toxins. Remarkably , replicating S.<pathogen> lugdunensis<pathogen> is not constrained by LAMP-1 and phosphatidylserine-positive endomembranes which is distinct from S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> that replicates within phagolysosomes. In vivo , S.<pathogen> lugdunensis<pathogen> can also reside in the murine Kupffer cell where the bacteria persist without replicating and require oatA to resist killing in vivo. The intracellular environment of the macrophage represents a niche where S.<pathogen> lugdunensis<pathogen> can exist whilst protected from extracellular immune factors and may serve as a reservoir from which these bacteria could disseminate.
