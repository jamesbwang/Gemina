  Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4) families are receptors for ligands that initiate extracellular or intracellular signaling , such as lipopolysaccharides ( LPS). It has been reported that TLR4 activation resulted in the upregulation of a coordinated set of proinflammatory mediators and inhibition of matrix expression in the intervertebral disc ( IVD). miR-140-5p ( miR-140) is reported to participate in cellular anti-inflammatory processes and target TLR4. In the present study , we investigated the relationship between TLR4 and miR-140 in IVD degeneration. The expression of TLR4 , interleukin ( IL) -6 , IL-I , L-1β and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α was higher , in high-grade IVD degeneration tissues than in low-grade tissues. In contrast , the expression of miR-140 , aggrecan and collagen type II was lower in high-grade IVD degeneration tissues than in low-grade IVD degeneration tissues. LPS stimulation resulted in significant increases in TLR4 expression and decreases in miR-140 expression in nucleus pulposus ( NP) cells and TLR4 was identified as a target of miR-140 by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The overexpression of miR-140 inhibited the upregulation of the expression of TLR4 , TNF-α , IL-1β and IL-6 inflammation<symptom> cytokines , and the activation of NF-κB and reversed the downregulation of the expression of aggrecan and collagen type II induced by LPS stimulation. In conclusion , the present study may lead to a greater understanding of IVD degeneration and provide new insights into the treatment of this disease.
