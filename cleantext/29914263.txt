  The temperature dependent kinetics of Ni + + O3 and of NiO + + CH4/CD4 are measured from 300- 600 K using a selected-ion flow tube apparatus. Together , these reactions comprise a catalytic cycle converting CH4 to CH3OH. The reaction of Ni + + O3 proceeds at the collisional limit , faster than previously reported at 300 K. The NiO + product reacts further with O3 , also at the collisional limit , to yield both higher oxides ( up to NiO5 + is observed) as well as undergoing an apparent reduction back to Ni +. This apparent reduction channel is due to the oxidation channel yielding NiO2 + * with sufficient energy to dissociate. 4NiO + + CH4 ( CD4) proceeds with a rate constant of 2.6 ± 0.4 x 10-10 cm3s-1 ( 1.8 ± 0.5 x 10-10 cm3 s-1) at 300 K and a temperature dependence of ~ T-0.7 ± 0.3 ( ~ T-1.1 ± 0.4) producing only the 2Ni + + 1CH3OH channel up to 600K. Statistical modeling of the reaction based on calculated stationary points along the reaction coordinate reproduce the experimental rate constant as a function of temperature , but under-predict the kinetic isotope shift. The modeling was found to better represent the data when the crossing from quartet to doublet surface was incomplete suggesting a possible kinetic effect in crossing from quartet to doublet surfaces. Additionally , the modeling predicts a competing 3NiOH + + 2CH3 channel to become increasingly important at higher temperatures.
