  In this letter , we study the confounder detection problem in the linear model , where the target variable ( Formula: see text) is predicted using its ( Formula: see text) potential causes ( Formula: see text). Based on an assumption of a rotation-invariant generating process of the model , recent study shows that the spectral measure induced by the regression coefficient vector with respect to the covariance matrix of ( Formula: see text) is close to a uniform measure in purely causal cases , but it differs from a uniform measure characteristically in the presence of a scalar confounder. Analyzing spectral measure patterns could help to detect confounding. In this letter , we propose to use the first moment of the spectral measure for confounder detection. We calculate the first moment of the regression vector-induced spectral measure and compare it with the first moment of a uniform spectral measure , both defined with respect to the covariance matrix of ( Formula: see text). The two moments coincide in nonconfounding cases and differ from each other in the presence of confounding. This statistical causal-confounding asymmetry can be used for confounder detection. Without the need to analyze the spectral measure pattern , our method avoids the difficulty of metric choice and multiple parameter optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real data show the performance of this method.
