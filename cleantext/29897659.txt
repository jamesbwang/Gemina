  Spinosad is a potent insecticide that exhibits an excellent environmental and mammalian profile. However , spinosad production in the original producer , Saccharopolyspora spinosa , is insufficient for the huge global demand. Great efforts have been exerted to improve the production of spinosad. Strategies for spinosad overproduction in actinomycetes are reviewed in this article , including metabolic engineering of the precursor and spinosyn biosynthetic pathway , introduction of regulatory genes , genome-scale metabolic model-guided engineering , mutagenesis , genome shuffling , fermentation process optimization , omics analysis , and the heterologous biosynthesis of spinosad in other actinomycetes. Furthermore , highly productive industrial strains should be used as heterologous hosts for enhancing spinosad biosynthesis in the future. To accelerate the engineering process , the CRISPR/Cas9 system should be established in Sa. spinosa for large-scale genome editing. Notably , the regulatory mechanism of spinosad biosynthesis remains unclear. Thus , the combining multi-omics analysis with high-throughput screening of chemical elicitors would be a promising approach in characterizing the regulatory and signal transduction mechanisms and improving spinosad production in Sa. Spinosa.
