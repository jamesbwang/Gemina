  The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the level of neuromotor function and somatic development in 6- and 7-year-old children born before the 30th week gestation with that in full-term children at the same age , as well as the correlation between prematurity and motor development. The study group consisted of prematurely born 40 children. Their mean gestational age at birth was 27.8 Â± 1.6 weeks ( range 24-30 weeks). The control group consisted of 40 healthy children born with normal birth weight ( > 2500 g). The neuromotor function was assessed using Touwen neurological examination criteria. During the examination , the attention was focused on the hand preference , laterality , synkinesis , and asymmetry. In addition , children 's weight , height , and BMI index were measured. Premature children showed much worse results than full-term ones in hand function ( The nondisabled , prematurely born children have significantly lower average outcomes regarding hand function , quality of walking , muscle<symptom> tone , coordination , and diadochokinesis at age of six to seven , compared to the full-term peers.
