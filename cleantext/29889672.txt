  Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP) is an established technique in routine magnetic resonance examination. By applying the compressed sensing ( CS) acceleration technique to conventional MRCP sequences , scan time can be markedly reduced. With promising results at 3 T , there is a necessity to evaluate the performance at 1.5 T due to wide scanner availabilities. Aim of this study is to test the feasibility of accelerated 3-dimensional ( 3D) MRCP with extended sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolution ( SPACE) using CS in navigator triggering and in a single breath-hold in a clinical setting at 1.5 T and 3 T and compare it with a conventional navigator-triggered 3D SPACE-MRCP. Phantom measurements were performed to adapt sequence parameters. Conventional 3D SPACE-MRCP in navigator triggering ( STD_MRCP) as well as CS-accelerated 3D SPACE-MRCP acquired in navigator triggering and in a single breath-hold ( CS_MRCP and CS_BH_MRCP) was performed in 66 patients undergoing clinically induced MRI of the pancreatobiliary system at 1.5 T and 3 T. Image quality evaluation was performed by 2 independent radiologists. Dedicated statistics were performed ( P < 0.05 considered significant). In patient imaging , CS_MRCP was superior to STD_MRCP and CS_BH_MRCP in aspects of overall image quality at 1.5 T ( P = 0.01; P < 0.001) and 3 T ( P = 0.002; P = 0.013). Overall image quality in CS_BH_MRCP was inferior compared with STD_MRCP and CS_MRCP at 1.5 T. At 3 T , overall image quality in CS_BH_MRCP was superior to STD_MRCP ( P = 0.001). Scan time was reduced by 25 % to 46 % covering 5 % of k-space ( CS_MRCP at 1.5 and 3 T) and 97 % covering 3.6 % of k-space ( CS_BH_MRCP at 1.5 and 3 T). Compressed sensing-accelerated MRCP is feasible in clinical routine at 1.5 and 3 T offering major reduction of acquisition time. When applying a single breath-hold CS imaging , field strengths of 3 T are recommended.
