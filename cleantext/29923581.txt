  Tumors can shed thousands of cells into the circulation daily. These circulating tumor cells ( CTCs) are heterogeneous , and their phenotypes change dynamically. Real-time monitoring of CTC phenotypes is crucial to elucidate the role of CTCs in the metastatic cascade. Here , we monitor phenotypic changes in CTCs in mice xenografted with tumors with varying aggressiveness during cancer progression and a course of chemotherapy to study the metastatic potential of CTCs and changes in the properties of these cells in response to treatment. A new device that enables magnetic ranking cytometry ( MagRC) is employed to profile the phenotypic properties of CTCs. Overall , CTCs from metastatic xenografts in mice display dynamic and heterogeneous profiles while non-metastatic models had static profiles. Decreased heterogeneity followed by a reduction in metastasis incidence was observed after a course of chemotherapy administered to highly metastatic xenografts. Phenotypic profiling of CTCs could be employed to monitor disease progression and predict therapeutic responses.
