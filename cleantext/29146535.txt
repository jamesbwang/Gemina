  The beneficial effects in lipid profiles after obesity surgery might be associated with the decrease in cardiovascular risk. However , direct comparison between different surgical techniques has not been extensively performed. In the present study we compare 20 obese women submitted to laparoscopic Roux en Y gastric bypass ( RYGB) with 20 women submitted to sleeve gastrectomy ( SG). Twenty control women matched for age and baseline cardiovascular risk were also included. Both patients and controls were followed up for 1 year after surgery or conventional treatment with diet and exercise , respectively. Lipid profiles were measured at baseline , 6 and 12 months later. Carotid intima-media thickness was measured by ultrasonography at baseline and at the end of the study. Women submitted to bariatric surgery showed a decrease in total cholesterol , triglycerides , oxidized-LDL and ApoB , and an increase in HDL and ApoA concentrations that occurred regardless of the surgical procedure. LDL concentrations , however , decreased only after RYGB whereas Lp ( a) showed no changes. We did not observe any correlation between the changes in serum lipid concentrations and those in carotid intima-media thickness. Sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass induce a similar beneficial effect on serum lipids in women with high cardiovascular risk 1 year after surgery.
