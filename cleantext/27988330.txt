  Humans have over 100 trillion bacteria , highly abundant in the intestinal tract. Evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota is associated with the neuro-endocrine-immune pathways and can be associated with various mood disorders. This review summarizes findings from studies looking into neurobiochemical , neuroendocrine , and neuroimmune system mechanisms of the gut-brain axis to determine the relationship between intestinal microbiota and mood disorders. The effect of prebiotics , probiotics and antibiotics on mood disorders are also discussed , with the aim to propose some new therapeutic strategies for mood disorders.
