  Triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC) is highly metastatic , and there is an urgent unmet need to develop novel therapeutic strategies leading to the new drug discoveries against metastasis. The transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β) is known to promote the invasive and migratory potential of breast cancer cells through induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) via the ERK/NF-κB/Snail signaling pathway , leading to breast cancer metastasis. Targeting this pathway to revert the EMT would be an attractive , novel therapeutic strategy to halt breast cancer metastasis. Effects of enterolactone ( EL) on the cell cycle and apoptosis were investigated using flow cytometry and a cleaved caspase-3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) , respectively. Effects of TGF-β induction and EL treatment on the functional malignancy of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were investigated using migration and chemo-invasion assays. The effects of EL on EMT markers and the ERK/NF-κB/Snail signaling pathway after TGF-β induction were studied using confocal microscopy , quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) , Western blot , and flow cytometry. Herein , we report that EL exhibits a significant antimetastatic effect on MDA-MB-231 cells by almost reverting the TGF-β-induced EMT Briefly , EL was found to inhibit TGF-β-induced EMT by blocking the ERK/NF-κB/Snail signaling pathway , which is a promising target for breast cancer metastasis therapy.
