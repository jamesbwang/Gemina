  Numerous surgical options have been introduced for the treatment of chronic refractory lateral epicondylitis of the elbow , but it remains unclear which option is superior. The clinical outcomes of an open surgery group and an arthroscopic surgery group were evaluated , and the results of the 2 procedures were compared. From among patients with lateral epicondylitis refractory to 6 months of conservative treatment , 68 patients satisfying study criteria were recruited. Open surgery was performed in 34 cases ( group 1) , and arthroscopic surgery was performed in 34 cases ( group 2). Compared with preoperatively , the 2 groups had significantly improved values for grip strength , range of motion , and Disabilities of the Arm , Shoulder and Hand score at 12 months postoperatively. Group 1 had significantly greater improvements in grip strength and visual analog scale pain score compared with group 2 ( P = .048 vs P = .006). Group 2 had significantly greater ( P = .045) improvement in pronation compared with group 1. Group 2 returned to work sooner than group 1. On the questionnaire regarding satisfaction with surgery 24 months postoperatively , 4 patients ( 12 %) in group 2 reported dissatisfaction compared with no patients in group 1. Open surgery and arthroscopic surgery both yielded good clinical results. Nonetheless , for patients requiring muscle strength or having severe<symptom> pain<symptom> at work , open surgery would be more effective. ( Orthopedics. 2018; 41 ( 4): 237-247.).
