  Total hip arthroplasty ( THA) is increasingly performed in younger patients. The purpose of this study is to report on the midterm outcomes of primary cementless THA in patients 55 years and younger; and specifically to examine the risk factors for aseptic failure , all-cause revision , and mortality in this patient population. Four hundred and twenty-six consecutive patients with minimum 5-year follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. Multivariate analyses were conducted to control for potential confounding factors identified by univariate analyses. Mean follow-up was 92.12 Â± 30.9 months. The overall 5-year implant survival rate was 90.8 % and the aseptic survival rate was 92.6 %. Among the potential risk factors , only bearing surface had a significant relationship with aseptic revision ( Bearing type was the only risk factor for revision surgery , particularly metal-on-polyethylene bearing. Patients with higher comorbidities were at increased risk for postoperative complications and mortality , while higher body<symptom> weight appeared to have a protective effect against mortality. These findings should be considered before surgery for risk modification and management of patient expectations. While it appears that bearing couples other than metal-on-polyethylene are especially suitable for young patients , more studies are needed to determine the best bearing couple and to reduce the rates of postoperative complications in this patient population.
