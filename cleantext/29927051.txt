  Acute liver failure patients who meet poor prognostic criteria have high early mortality without emergency liver transplantation. A recent study however , reported that patients that survive spontaneously have a poorer outcome compared with patients undergoing transplantation. In this single center study , we aimed to confirm or refute this observation. Early survivors ( patients who survived 90 days) were assessed for long term outcomes in 4 distinctive cohorts , incorporating aetiology ( Acetaminophen overdose or non-Acetaminophen overdose related acute liver failure) , and management strategy ( conservative or liver transplantation). Chi Squared or Fisher test were used to compare outcomes among the 4 cohorts ( p < 0.05) and Kaplan Meier curve ( Log Rank test) to represent cumulative survival. 200 consecutive acute liver failure patients between 1990 and 2014 were included; mean age 38.3 , ± 12.8 , male 70 , 35 %. 124/200 ( 62 %) early survivors were identified; 13/124 ( 10.5 %) acetaminophen patients underwent transplantation and 48/124 ( 38.7 %) survived spontaneously; 36/124 ( 29.0 %) non-acetaminophen underwent transplantation and 27/124 ( 21.8 %) survived spontaneously. 11/124 ( 8.9 %) died subsequently ( median survival 5.3 ± IQR 9.1); three spontaneous survivors and 8 transplanted patients ( p = 0.025); of the 8 transplanted patients , six died of transplant related complications and two of suicide. The results of this study suggest that although liver transplantation is a life-saving operation for acute liver failure patients , they have a worse long-term outcome compared with spontaneous survivors. Novel therapies to increase the percentage of spontaneous survivors are urgently needed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
