  Very little is known about the occurrence of type 1 diabetes ( T1DM) in resource-poor countries and particularly in their rural hinterlands. Studies of the epidemiology of T1DM in Ethiopia and similar countries in sub-Saharan Africa show that the pattern of presenting disease differs substantially from that in the West<disease>. Typically , the peak age of onset of the disease is more than a decade later with a male excess and a low prevalence of indicators of islet-cell autoimmunity. It is also associated with markers of undernutrition. These findings raise the question as to whether the principal form of T1DM seen in these resource-poor communities has a different pathogenesis. Whether the disease is a direct result of malnutrition or whether malnutrition may modify the expression of islet-cell autoimmunity is unclear. However , the poor prognosis in these settings underlines the urgent need for detailed clinical and epidemiological studies.
