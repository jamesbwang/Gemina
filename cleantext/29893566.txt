  The nucleophilic ring opening of donor-acceptor cyclopropanes with the cyanate ion is reported for the first time. Cyclopropanes , spiro-activated with oxindole fragments as acceptors , are shown to undergo transformations into biologically relevant spiro ( pyrrolidone-3,3 '- oxindoles) while being treated with potassium cyanate under microwave assistance.
