  Sporadic adult-onset ataxia<symptom> ( SAOA) is a nongenetic neurodegenerative disorder of the cerebellum of unknown cause which manifests with progressive<symptom> ataxia<symptom>. It is distinguished from hereditary ataxias<symptom> and from acquired ataxias<symptom>. SAOA also needs to be differentiated from multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type ( MSA-C). Thus , the diagnosis of SAOA can only be made by exclusion. Although cerebellar ataxia<symptom> is the prominent symptom in SAOA , patients often have additional nonataxia signs , including pyramidal tracts signs , decreased or absent ankle reflexes , sensory<symptom> disturbances<symptom> , mainly in the form of reduced vibration sense , and mild<symptom> urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom> that do not the fulfill the criteria for severe autonomic failure required for the diagnosis of MSA-C. Disease progression in SAOA is considerably slower than in MSA-C. Brain imaging typically shows isolated cerebellar atrophy. Nerve conduction studies provide evidence for polyneuropathy in about one-third of SAOA patients. As the etiology and pathogenesis of SAOA are unknown , there is no specific treatment approach to this condition.
