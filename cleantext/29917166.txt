  The mechanisms of malignant cell metastasis to secondary sites are complex and multifactorial. Studies have demonstrated that small integrin‑binding ligand N‑linked glycoproteins ( SIBLINGs) , particularly bone sialoprotein ( BSP) and osteopontin ( OPN) , are involved in neoplastic growth and metastasis. SIBLINGs promote malignant cell invasion and metastasis by enhancing matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( MMP‑2) and MMP‑9 expression. Moreover , BSP and OPN can combine with integrin , which is located on the tumor cell surface , to further promote the malignant behavior of tumor cells. In the present study , we investigated whether SB225002 , a specific CXCR2 receptor antagonist , can inhibit prostate cancer cell expression of BSP and OPN and reduce cancer cell invasion ability. A series of experiments showed that after SB225002 treatment , the proliferation , invasion and migration of two androgen‑independent prostate cancer cell lines were inhibited , but this inhibitory effect was not observed on androgen‑dependent prostate cancer cells. Western blotting showed that the PI3K signaling pathway could regulate the expression of SIBLING and MMP family proteins , and SB22055 could reduce the expression of BSP , OPN and MMP‑2 in prostate cancer cells by inhibiting AKT/mTOR phosphorylation. Finally , in vivo experiments confirmed that SB225002 inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vivo , and the expression levels of BSP , OPN and MMP‑2 were also inhibited.
