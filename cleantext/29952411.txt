  It has been supposed that endocrine disturbances might be responsible for PCOS-associated oxidative stress , with special emphasis on hyperandrogenism.Considering potential relationship between hyperandrogenism and increased free radicals production , parameters of oxidative stress were determined in non-obese normoinsulinemic adolescent girls newly diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome<disease> ( PCOS). Nitrotyrosine , thiol groups ' concentrations , glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities were determined under fasting conditions and during oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT) in 35 PCOS patients and 17 controls. Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model ( HOMA-IR) , HOMA Î² , IGI , Matsuda insulin sensitivity index ( ISI) and AUC for glucose. Glutathione S-transferases ( GSTs) polymorphisms were determined by PCR. Under fasting conditions , no significant difference of oxidative stress parameters was found between PCOS and controls. Acute hyperglycemia during OGTT induced significant alteration in parameters of oxidative protein damage in PCOS patients. Alteration in nitrotyrosine concentrations correlated with testosterone , DHEAS , androstenediones , FAI and LH , while change in thiol groups correlated with DHEAS. Significant inverse association was found between LH and ISI , as well as AUC glucose and thiol groups. PCOS girls , carriers of GSTM1-null genotype had significantly lower testosterone in comparison to ones with GSTM1-active genotype. PCOS girls exhibited high free radicals production together with unchanged antioxidant enzymatic capacity , independently from obesity and insulin resistance. Based on associations between oxidative stress parameters and testosterone , DHEAS and androstenedione , it can be suggested that increased free radicals production , probably as a consequence of hyperandrogenemia is an early event in the development of PCOS.
