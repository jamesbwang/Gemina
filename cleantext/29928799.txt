  Toward the bottom-up assembly of synthetic cells from molecular building blocks , it is an ongoing challenge to assemble micrometer sized compartments that host different processes into precise multicompartmental assemblies , also called prototissues. The difficulty lies in controlling interactions between different compartments dynamically both in space and time , as these interactions determine how they organize with respect to each other and how they work together. In this study , we have been able to control the self-assembly and social self-sorting of four different types of colloids , which we use as a model for synthetic cells , into two separate families with visible light. For this purpose we used two photoswitchable protein pairs ( iLID/Nano and nHagHigh/pMagHigh) that both reversibly heterodimerize upon blue light exposure and dissociate from each other in the dark. These photoswitchable proteins provide noninvasive , dynamic , and reversible remote control under biocompatible conditions over the self-assembly process with unprecedented spatial and temporal precision. In addition , each protein pair brings together specifically two different types of colloids. The orthogonality of the two protein pairs enables social self-sorting of a four component mixture into two distinct families of colloidal aggregates with controlled arrangements. These results will ultimately pave the way for the bottom-up assembly of multicompartment synthetic prototissues of a higher complexity , enabling us to control precisely and dynamically the organization of different compartments in space and time.
