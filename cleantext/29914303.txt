  Lipoprotein ( a) ( Lp ( a)) is associated with premature atherosclerosis in menopausal women without metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MS). MS is the main confounder in the relationship between Lp ( a) and atherosclerosis in menopausal women. We have evaluated the relationship between Lp ( a) and small dense-low density lipoprotein ( sd-LDL) in 228 menopausal women participating to Progetto Atena. Lp ( a) was measured and LDL particle separation was performed: mean LDL diameter and LDL score ( % of sd-LDL) particles calculated. Women without MS and elevated Lp ( a) have increased number of sd-LDL ( p < .05) and higher LDL score compared with those below the median of the studied population ( p < .05). The association between Lp ( a) and sd-LDL was evaluated taking into account different adjustment models. Women with elevated levels of Lp ( a) show the following OR of having a small LDL diameter ( in the lowest quartile): 1.02 , p = .003; adjusted for age; 1.02 , p = .002; adjusted for age , and triglycerides , or a high LDL score ( in the highest quartile): 1.02 , p = .006; adjusted for age; 1.02 , p = .002; adjusted for age and triglycerides. In this group of menopausal women without MS , the independent association of Lp ( a) with sd-LDL might explain at least in part the association of Lp ( a) with premature atherosclerosis.
