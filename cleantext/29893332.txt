  Several factors contribute to the increase in breast cancer ( BC) incidence , such as lifetime exposure to estrogen , early menarche and older ages at first birth , menopause , and the increased prevalence of postmenopausal obesity. In fact , there is an association between an increased BC risk and elevated estrogen levels , which may be involved in carcinogenesis via the estrogen receptor alpha ( ERα) encoded by the ESR1 gene. Interestingly , there is an antagonistic relationship between ERα and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR) in BC cells. Herein , we explore the combined effects of the ESR1 ( XbaI , PvuII) and AhR polymorphisms on BC development in Mexican women according to their menopausal status. Investigation was performed using a cases and controls design. In a group of 96 cases diagnosed with BC and 111 healthy women , the single-nucleotide polymorphisms ESR1 ( XbaI , PvuII) and AhR gene were identified by qPCR. Chi-square test or Fisher 's exact test were used. Statistical analyses were conducted using the STATA statistical package ( Version 10.1 , STATA Corp. , College Station , TX , USA). The G/G XbaI genotype was more prevalent in the cases than in the controls ( P = 0.008). Moreover , Mexican women carrying the XbaI ( wild type ( WT)/ G or G/G) ESR1 genotype have higher risk ( 12.26-fold) for developing postmenopausal BC than individuals carrying the WT/WT genotype. The presence of the G/G genotype of XbaI may be considered a susceptibility allele in Mexican women. Due to increased postmenopausal BC risk , the XbaI ( WT/G or G/G) alleles may be used as a postmenopausal predictive factor for BC in Mexican women.
