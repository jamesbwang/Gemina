  Nickel ( Ni) concentrations in aquatic ecosystems can be amplified by anthropogenic activities including resource extraction. Compared with fish and invertebrates , knowledge of Ni toxicity in amphibians is limited , especially for northern species. We examined the effect of Ni on wood frog ( Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles , the species with the widest and most northern distribution of any anuran in North<pathogen> America. Wood frog tadpoles were exposed to a Ni concentration gradient ( 0.02-5.5 mg/L of Ni at 164 mg/L as CaCO
