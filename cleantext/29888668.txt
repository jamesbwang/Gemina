  In this study , we analyzed extracts of Ribes ( black currant , red currant and gooseberry) fruits obtained with methanol , methanol 50 % and water. For each extract total polyphenol content , total flavonoid content and total anthocyanin content was assessed. The antioxidant activity of extracts was evaluated by 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl ( DPPH) and 2,2 '- azino-bis ( 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) ( ABTS) radical scavenging capacity and by the photo-chemiluminescence ( PCL) method. Identification and quantification of individual phenolic compounds was performed by means of high performance liquid chromatograph coupled with diode array detector ( HPLC-DAD) analyses. From each fruit , best extraction of polyphenols was obtained with methanol 50 %. In case of red currants and gooseberry there was no significant difference in flavonoids and anthocyanins extraction rate by the different extraction solvents. For black currants the methanol and methanol 50 % extract presented the highest antioxidant activity. For red currants extracts with methanol 50 % showed stronger antioxidant activity ( IC
