  This chapter begins by considering why it is important to understand the clinical patterns of acute toxicity associated with new psychoactive substances ( NPS) , the challenges associated with gathering these data , the sources of information available and the limitations of each. It describes the data triangulation approach that can be used to combine individual , each inherently limited , data sources to help build the picture of the pattern of acute non-fatal toxicity associated with NPS. The chapter illustrates the data triangulation approach by the use of clinical examples and aims to consider mechanism of action data in conjunction with clinical features to provide an overarching understanding of the clinical presentation. Examples of the most important individual and groups of NPS were identified using multimodal literature searching based on the most relevant terms. The chapter provides descriptive accounts that are a complete reference source on the patterns of acute toxicity.
