  Optimal enzyme activity depends on a number of factors , including structure and dynamics. The role of enzyme structure is well recognized; however , the linkage between protein dynamics and enzyme activity has given rise to a contentious debate. We have developed an approach that uses an aqueous mixture of organic solvent to control the functionally relevant enzyme dynamics ( without changing the structure) , which in turn modulates the enzyme activity. Using this approach , we predicted that the hydride transfer reaction catalyzed by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR) from Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in aqueous mixtures of isopropanol ( IPA) with water will decrease by âˆ¼ 3 fold at 20 % ( v/v) IPA concentration. Stopped-flow kinetic measurements find that the pH-independent k
