  The importance of kyphoscoliosis peptidase ( KY) in skeletal muscle physiology has recently been emphasised by the identification of novel human myopathies associated with KY deficiency. Neither the pathogenic mechanism of KY deficiency nor a specific role for KY in muscle function have been established. However , aberrant localisation of filamin C ( FLNC) in muscle fibres has been shown in humans and mice with loss-of-function mutations in the
