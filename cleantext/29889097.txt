  The aim of this study was to apply texture analysis to investigate whether there was a change in the lens following radiotherapy. Patients who received radiotherapy ( RT) for head and neck cancer or brain tumour were enrolled. Computed tomography ( CT) images taken one month before RT and the most recent images after RT were compared. Entropy values were calculated using lens attenuation values. The lens doses were obtained from the dose-volume histogram data. A total of 55 lenses were evaluated. The mean Hounsfield Unit value of the lenses was 66.14 ± 12.16 before RT and 72.02 ± 9.12 after RT ( p = 0.007). The mean entropy value was 1.87 ± 0.31 before RT and this reduced to 1.31 ± 0.34 after RT ( p < 0.001) , respectively. As time increased , the difference in entropy also increased ( p = 0.007). A correlation close to statistical significance was determined between the entropy difference and minimum , maximum and mean lens radiation dose ( p = 0.052 , p = 0.052 , p = 0.063 , respectively). The entropy difference was significantly reduced in the > 4 Gy group ( p = 0.046). Study results indicated that the entropy values in the lens were signifcantly changed after radiotherapy and the degree of the change associated with dose and time.
