  To avoid an additional scar , our novel single-port laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair technique that utilizes the previous prostatectomy scar was conducted. Inguinal hernia is one of the most common complications of radical prostatectomy that require surgical repair. At present , such surgical repair inevitably leaves additional scars on the abdominal wall. This case series study was performed to determine the safety and feasibility of this procedure in patients with inguinal hernia after radical prostatectomy. All patients who underwent retropubic radical prostatectomy ( RRP) in 2012-2016 and developed an inguinal hernia as a complication of RRP agreed to undergo single-port laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal ( TAPP) repair of the inguinal hernia through the RRP scar. TAPP repair was performed using a homemade glove single port through a 2 cm wide incision into the upper part of the RRP scar. The duration between RRP and the development of inguinal hernia , TAPP repair operative time , follow-up duration , TAPP repair-related complications , and rate of inguinal hernia recurrence were recorded. Of the 131 patients who underwent RRP in the study period , 12 ( mean age , 67.58 ± 5.73 years) developed inguinal hernia during an average follow-up duration of 33.58 ± 16.49 months. None had a previous history of inguinal hernia. The inguinal hernias developed on average 3.83 ± 1.70 months after RRP. The mean operative time was 64.58 ± 6.20 minutes. There were no surgical complications or recurrence of inguinal hernia during follow-up. Single-port laparoscopic TAPP inguinal hernia repair through the previous prostatectomy scar is safe and feasible.
