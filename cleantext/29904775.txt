  We report a chemoselective and site-selective approach that distinguishes one Lys from its multiple copies , N-terminus , and other competitors. The phospha-Mannich protocol works with multiple proteins and installs probes without structural and functional perturbations. It delivers an antibody-drug conjugate with selective anti-proliferative activity towards HER2 expressing SKBR3 breast cancer cells.
