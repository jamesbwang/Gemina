  In the last decade , layered materials and their 2D counterparts , such as graphene , transition metal chalcogenides or black phosphorus , have been tested for their electrocatalytic properties. The main application is in the hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) and the oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR) , in which layered materials could possibly replace platinum. Although platinum offers both the lowest overpotential and the highest current density , it is also expensive and rare and has little tolerance to passivation. On the other hand , metal diborides are well known for their high chemical stability and low cost. Surprisingly , until now , only a few electrochemical properties of diborides have been studied. In this paper , we present the study of the electrocatalytic properties of metal borides ( namely AlB2 , CrB2 , HfB2 , MgB2 , NbB2 , TaB2 , TiB2 , VB2 and ZrB2) towards the HER and ORR together with their structural and chemical characterization.
