  This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different coronal restoration techniques on fracture resistance of root canal-treated mandibular premolars with mesio-occluso-distal ( MOD) cavities. A total of 105 mandibular premolars were selected and randomly distributed into seven groups ( n = 15). MOD cavities were prepared except the control group. Root canal treatments were performed. Each tooth was embedded in acrylic resin. Groups were classified as follows; G1: intact teeth ( control) , G2: unfilled MOD cavity , G3: MOD + composite resin , G4: 10-mm-long fiber post + composite resin , G5: 5-mm-long fiber post + composite resin , G6: Ribbond in the occlusal surface + composite resin , and G7: horizontal fiber post + composite resin. Specimens were loaded using a universal testing machine until fracture occurs. Fracture loads were recorded and statistical interpretations were made ( Î± = 0.05). In Groups 1 , 6 , and 7 , the greatest fracture resistance was shown and there were no significant differences among these groups ( P > 0.05). No significant differences were detected among the Groups 3 , 4 , and 5 ( P > 0.05) , whereas the fracture resistances of Groups 1 , 6 , and 7 were significantly greater than these three groups ( P < 0.05). Group 2 had the lowest fracture resistance of all groups ( P < 0.05). Usage of horizontal post or occlusal Ribbond usage increased the fracture resistance of root canal-treated premolars with MOD cavities.
