  We report a 63-year-old male whose bone<disease> marrow morphology and flow cytometry showed evidence of B-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia<disease> ( B-CLL). Chromosome analysis of the bone<disease> marrow showed an abnormal karyotype , described as 46 , XY , t ( 18; 22) ( q21; q11 .2) ( 19)/ 46 , XY ( 1). FISH analysis on interphase nuclei revealed an abnormal clone with loss of D13S319 ( 13q14 .3) in 68.0 % of the cells examined. Deletion of chromosome 13 is the most common cytogenetic abnormality identified in CLL ( approximately 50 % of CLL). Recent studies suggest that deletion of chromosome 13q14 in 65 % or more nuclei by FISH is associated with an intermediate to unfavorable prognosis in CLL. The t ( 18; 22) ( q21; q11 .2) present in this case , as well as the t ( 2; 18) ( p12; q21) , are variants of the t ( 14; 18) ( q32; q21); all three are abnormalities in CLL. These abnormalities are found in less than 4 % of CLL cases. They are usually present within the context of a complex karyotype in a subset of CLL , but can also be observed in cases of benign lymphocytosis. Herein , we report a t ( 18; 22) ( q21; q11 .2) in a CLL patient as a sole cytogenetic abnormality by conventional cytogenetics , and with loss of 13q14 .3 , as determined by FISH. To the best of our knowledge , this is one of the few cases of its kind.
