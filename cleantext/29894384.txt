  To characterize disparities in cumulative plasma HIV<pathogen> burden in a sample of adults accessing HIV<pathogen> care in San Francisco , California. Observational cohort and supplemental HIV<pathogen> surveillance data. Data from the San Francisco Medical Monitoring Project 2012-2014 cycles and HIV<pathogen> surveillance data were used to create an analytic cohort followed for 2 years. Matched HIV<pathogen> viral load test results from HIV<pathogen> surveillance were used to create five viral outcome measures: any unsuppressed viral load ( > 200 copies/ml) , any transmittable viral load ( > 1500 copies/ml) , person-time spent unsuppressed , person-time spent transmittable , and 2-year viremia copy-years , a measure of cumulative plasma HIV<pathogen> burden. Rao-Scott chi-squares and analysis of variance examined differences in durable suppression and mean percentage time spent unsuppressed and transmittable. Weighted linear regression was used to describe differences in cumulative HIV<pathogen> burden. Adults receiving HIV<pathogen> care spent approximately 12 % of the 2-year time period with an unsuppressed viral load and approximately 7 % of the time at a transmittable viral level. Factors independently associated with higher cumulative HIV<pathogen> viremia in an adjusted model included trans women identity , younger age , lower CD4 cell count , and a history of homelessness , incarceration , not taking ART , and nonadherence to ART. Although 95 % of the cohort of adults in HIV<pathogen> care in San Francisco self-reported ART use during MMP interview , they spent on average almost 1 month per year at a transmittable viral level. We identified characteristics of those who were more likely to have higher viral burden , highlighting priorities for resource allocation to reduce onward HIV<pathogen> transmission.
