  The major histocompatibility complex ( MHC) plays an important role in the vertebrate immune response to antigenic peptides , and it is essential for recognizing foreign pathogens in organisms. In this study , MHC class IIα ( Trov-MHC IIα) from the golden pompano ( Trachinotus ovatus<pathogen>) was first cloned and identified. The gene structure of Trov-MHC IIα was contained four exons and three introns. High levels of polymorphism were found in the exon 2 of Trov-MHC IIα. A total of 29 different MHC class IIα alleles with high polymorphism were identified from 80 individuals. The ratio of non-synonymous substitutions ( dN) to synonymous substitutions ( dS) was 3.157 ( > 1) in the peptide binding regions ( PBRs) of Trov-MHC IIα , suggesting positive balancing selection. Six alleles were selected to analyze the association between alleles and resistance/susceptibility to Vibrio<pathogen> harveyi<pathogen> in golden pompano. The results showed that Trov-DAA * 6401 and Trov-DAA * 6702 alleles were associated with the resistance to V.<pathogen> harveyi<pathogen> in golden pompano , while alleles Trov-DAA * 6304 and Trov-DAA * 7301 were associated with the susceptibility to V.<pathogen> harveyi<pathogen> in golden pompano. This study confirmed the association between alleles of MHC class IIα and disease resistance , and also detected some alleles which might be correlated with high V. harveyi-resistance. These disease resistance-related MHC alleles could be used as potential genetic markers for molecular marker-assisted selective breeding in the golden pompano.
