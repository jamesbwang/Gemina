  Due to the high prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency in spite of abundant sunshine and scarcity of studies investigating Vitamin D status in Indian children from rural and semirural areas , the objectives of this cross-sectional study were to: ( 1) assess the Vitamin D status of school-children in a semi-rural setting and ( 2) identify the determinants of Vitamin D status in these children. Data collected included anthropometric measurements ( height and weight) , body composition , three-one-day dietary recall method , demographic data , and sunlight exposure. Serum 25-hydroxyVitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D was estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) technique. SPSS software was used for statistical analysis. Anthropometric characteristics of the children were similar and mean serum 25 ( OH) D concentration was 58.5 Â± 10.3 nmol/L with no significant differences between genders. Around 80 % children reported sunlight exposure of 2 h or more. A majority ( 71 %) of children were Vitamin D insufficient with serum 25 ( OH) D concentrations between 50 and 74.9 nmol/L. Determinants of Vitamin D identified were duration of sunlight exposure and body fat percent. Significant ( We have reported a high prevalence of Vitamin D insufficiency in school-children aged 6-12 years , from a semirural setting , in spite of a majority ( 80 %) reporting > 2 h of sunlight exposure. We have also demonstrated that duration of sunlight exposure and body fat percentage are the two important determinants of serum 25 ( OH) D concentrations in these children.
