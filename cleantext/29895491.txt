  This randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of silymarin supplementation on glycemic indices and serum lipid profile in type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) patients. 40 T2DM patients ( twenty male and twenty female) , 25-50 years of age and on stable medication , were recruited for the present paralleled , randomized , triple-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial. The participants were randomly assigned to the silymarin or placebo groups , in which the patients either received 140 mg of silymarin , thrice daily ( n = 20) or placebo ( n = 20) for 45 days. Anthropometric and dietary intake data were collected at the baseline and end of the trial. Fasting blood samples were collected , and glycemic indices and lipid profile were determined at baseline , as well as the end of the study. Silymarin supplementation led to significant reduction in fasting blood sugar , serum insulin , homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance , serum triglyceride and triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio as compared to the placebo , by 11.01 , 14.35 , 25.92 , 23.7 and 27.67 % respectively. There was significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index in the silymarin group as compared to the placebo group , by 6.88 and 5.64 % respectively , ( p < 0.05). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations significantly decreased in the silymarin group as compared to the baseline , by 7.93 ( p = 0.001) and 7.15 % ( p = 0.02) , respectively. Silymarin supplementation may improve the glycemic indices and lipid profiles of T2DM patients. More studies are needed to validate the adjunct use of silymarin for metabolic control of T2DM patients.
