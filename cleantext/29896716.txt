  For a long time , mice have been less popular than rats for studying cognitive impairment , mainly because much less neuroanatomical and neurochemical information was available on mice than on rats. Over the recent years , the generation of many types of transgenic mice has brought mice to the forefront of this research. Genetically modified mouse models have demonstrated useful to search memory and learning processes and the neurocircuitry and molecular mechanisms involved , as well as to extend therapies for cognitive impairment. A diversity of protocols has been developed to evaluate cognition in mice. The test models have been carefully selected according to reliability of results and disease relevance of the cognitive functions evaluated. Further criteria were ease of application and time efficiency. All tests evaluate slightly different but also interacting aspects or overlapping of learning and memory so that they can be utilized to complement each other in a comprehensive evaluation of cognitive function. In this chapter , three main protocols for evaluation cognitive/behavioral effect induced by drugs in postnatal mouse such as passive avoidance , radial arm maze ( RAM) , and Morris water maze ( MWM) tests are described.
