  Striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase ( STEP) modulates key signaling molecules involved in synaptic plasticity and neuronal function. It is postulated that STEP opposes the development of long-term potentiation ( LTP) and that it exerts a restraint on long-term memory ( LTM). Here , we examined whether STEP
