  The potent antibacterial lanthipeptide microvionin , isolated from a culture of Microbacterium<pathogen> arborescens<pathogen> , exhibits a new triamino-dicarboxylic acid moiety , termed avionin , and an unprecedented N-terminal guanidino fatty acid. We identified the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster and reconstituted central steps of avionin biosynthesis in vitro. Genome mining and isolation of nocavionin from Nocardia terpenica revealed a widespread distribution of this lanthipeptide class , termed lipolanthines , which may be useful as future antimicrobial drugs.
