  Syphilis<disease> is a cause of morbidity and mortality and is of particular concern in pregnancy in low income countries because of risks associated with maternal-fetal transmission. Ugandan national guidelines recommend a non-treponemal Rapid Plasma Reagin ( RPR) followed by treponemal testing for diagnosis of syphilis<disease> The RPR test confirms a reactive specific treponemal test , or confirms serological ` cure ' with a 4-fold dilutional decrease; RPR is beset with technical and biological limitations making accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment problematic. The aim of this analysis was to compare performance of RPR-testing in different laboratories. Stored , freeze-thawed sera from 215 participants were additionally tested for RPR and dilutional titer in two different reference laboratories. Discrepant results were tested at a third reference lab which served as a tie-breaker. Equivalence in RPR titer was defined as within â‰¤ 2 fold. All patients with a reactive rapid tests were treated as per Ugandan national guidelines. Of 215 sera , 97 ( 45.1 %) were RPR reactive in clinic laboratory A , 81 ( 37.7 %) and 65 ( 30.2 %) were RPR reactive in labs B and C respectively. All reported positive in the lab C were positive in lab B. Discrepant results were tested in lab D. Chi square test was highly significant ( P = < 0.001) for difference between each dyad of labs ( A&B , A&C and B&C) RPR results. There were significant differences between RPR titers by paired t-test and Wilcox rank test ( P = < 0.001); with up to a 3-fold difference between labs. Two one-sided test approach demonstrated non-equivalence. Agreement between labs B-D , and C-D: 48/49 ( 98.0 %) and 35/49 ( 71.4 %) respectively ( P = < 0.001). Labs B and D showed no significant difference and had equivalent RPR titers. Labs C and D had different titers ( P = < 0.001) and were not equivalent. We found significant inter- laboratory discrepant RPR results. It is likely that a 3-fold difference in results is likely to be clinically significant and could result in under- or over-treatment. These data demonstrate a key limitation of the RPR test and underline the urgent need for a more reproducible quantitative test than the current RPR for diagnosing and determining cure of
