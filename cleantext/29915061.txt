  Retrograde transport of membranes<symptom> and proteins from the cell surface to the Golgi and beyond is essential to maintain homeostasis , compartment identity , and physiological functions. To study retrograde traffic biochemically , by live-cell imaging or by electron microscopy , we engineered functionalized anti-GFP nanobodies ( camelid VHH antibody domains) to be bacterially expressed and purified. Tyrosine sulfation consensus sequences were fused to the nanobody for biochemical detection of
