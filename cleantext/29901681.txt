  We investigate the role of the local protein environment on the energy transfer processes in biological molecules , excluding from the analysis the effect of intra-chromophore nuclear motions , and focussing on the exciton-phonon coupling. We studied three different proteins ( FMO and two variants of the WSCP protein) with different biological functions but similar chromophores , to understand whether a classification of chromophores based on the details of the environment would be possible , and whether specific environments enhance or suppress the coupling between exciton and protein dynamics. Our results show that despite the different biological role , there is no significant difference in the influence of the environment on the properties of the chromophores. Additionally , we show that the main role in influencing molecular properties is played by solvent molecules: the interaction occurs on a medium-range scale , and the solvent is kept in place by a strong H-bond network being free to rotate , suggesting a dipole-dipole interaction mechanism. Steric hindrance exerted by other moieties can help modulating the interactions and tuning the energy transfer process. Overall , considering also the relatively greater importance of intra-molecular nuclear motions , the protein environment around biological chromophores does not appear fine-tuned for a specific function.
