  Methanogenic substrate loss is reported to be a major bottleneck in microbial fuel cell ( MFC) , which significantly reduces the power production capacity and coulombic efficiency ( CE) of this system. Nitroethane is found to be a potent inhibitor of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in rumen fermentation process. Influence of nitroethane pre-treated sewage sludge inoculum on suppressing the methanogenic activity and enhancing the electrogenesis in MFC was evaluated. MFC inoculated with nitroethane pre-treated anodic inoculum demonstrated a maximum operating voltage of 541 mV , with CE and maximum volumetric power density of 39.85 % and 20.5 W/m
