  Long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) refer to functional cellular RNAs molecules longer than 200 nucleotides in length. Unlike microRNAs , which have been widely studied , little is known about the enigmatic role of lncRNAs. However , lncRNAs have motivated extensively attention in the past few years and are emerging as potentially important regulators in pathological processes , including in cancer. We now understand that lncRNAs play role in cancer through their interactions with DNA , protein , and RNA in many instances. Moreover , accumulating evidence has recognized that large classes of lncRNAs are functional for ovarian cancer. Nevertheless , the biological phenomena and molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in ovarian cancer remain to be better identified. In this review , we outline the dysregulated expression of lncRNAs and their potential clinical implications in ovarian cancer , with a particular emphasis on discussing the well characterized mechanisms underlying lncRNAs in ovarian cancer.
