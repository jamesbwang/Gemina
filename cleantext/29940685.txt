  The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility , safety , and efficacy of the resection of parapharyngeal space ( PPS) tumors via an endoscopic transoral approach. We reviewed 9 patients who were diagnosed with PPS tumors and who were treated with an endoscopic transoral approach. PPS tumors ranging from 2.5 to 6 cm were removed completely with no complications and excellent recovery ( mean inpatient hospital stay: 6.89 days). Pathology was pleomorphic adenoma ( n = 7) , schwannoma ( n = 1) and malignant pleomorphic adenoma ( n = 1). For the malignant lesion<symptom> , the patient underwent postoperative radiotherapy ( 70 Gy). There was no radiographic evidence of recurrences , with mean follow-up of 11.22 months ( range: 3 to 20). We conclude that resection of PPS tumors via an endoscopic transoral approach appears to be feasible , safe , and effective. Potential advantages of this approach include an excellent surgical view , rapid surgical access , less tissue injury , avoidance of external scar , fewer postoperative complications , and less morbidity.
