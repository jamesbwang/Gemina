  To describe the arthroscopic surgical technique for subspine impingement ( SSI) of the anterior inferior iliac spine ( AIIS) associated with mixed type femoroacetabular impingement ( FAI) , through two standard arthroscopic portals ( anterolateral and distal mid-anterior) in two patients with trifocal impingement. The authors report the cases of two young male patients , aged 32 and 36 years old , with trifocal femoropelvic impingement ( TFPI). The technique consists of segmental capsulectomy , arthroscopic dissection of the AIIS , partial release of the direct head of the rectus<pathogen> femoris , resection of the AIIS projection with a burr and with fluoroscopic aid , correction of the pincer deformity , repair of the labrum with bioabsorbable anchors , and femoral osteoplasty. Details of the diagnostic workup and of the surgical technique are provided and discussed. In these cases , full range of motion was regained after surgery , as well as complete relief of pain , which was sustained in the last follow-up , one year post-operatively. Radiographs show adequate correction of the deformities in all three impingement sites. Simultaneous correction of the three sites ( cam , pincer , and subspinal) provided full relief of symptoms and allowed return to work and sports. The authors propose that when approaching the symptomatic SSI , the possibility of concomitant FAI should always be considered and , in those cases , the approach must be comprehensive.
