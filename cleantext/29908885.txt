  Our previous investigations have shown that bone marrow-derived cells ( BMCs) , including mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) , contribute to the development of choroidal neovascularization ( CNV) as sources of cells and angiogenic factors. Two main steps for circulating BMCs to integrate into CNV lesions<symptom> are extracellular matrix remodeling and consequential cell migration. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) were found to be involved in CNV development; however , little is known about whether miRNAs regulate the contribution of BMCs to CNV. In the present study , we found that the expression of miR-188-5p was decreased in cultured hypoxic MSCs and BMCs within laser-induced CNV in mice. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( MMP-2) and MMP-13 were both discovered as targets of miR-188-5p by bioinformatics predictions and dual-luciferase reporter system. Accordingly , increased expression of MMP-2/ 13 was found in hypoxic MSCs and BMCs in CNV lesions<symptom>. Furthermore , miR-188-5p mimic transfection caused downregulation of MMP-2/ 13 in hypoxic MSCs and decreased tube formation of co-cultured vascular endothelial cells. Intravitreal injections of a miR-188-5p agomir attenuated the severity of CNV and inhibited the migration of BMCs into CNV lesions<symptom> in mice. Our study suggests that miR-188-5p regulates the contribution of BMCs to CNV development by targeting MMP-2/ 13-mediated extracellular matrix degeneration , and miR-188-5p serves as a therapeutic target to treat CNV-related diseases.
