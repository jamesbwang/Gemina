  Myclobutanil is currently used on the flowering plants. Little is known about how Apis cerana cerana respond to myclobutanil exposure. Hence , the acute toxicity of myclobutanil and its sublethal effects on respiration<symptom> , flight and detoxification enzymes ( 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase ( ECOD) and glutathione S-transferases ( GSTs)) in A. cerana cerana were investigated. The results indicated that formulation grade myclobutanil showed moderate toxicity to A. cerana cerana either contact ( LD
