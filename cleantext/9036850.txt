  Acoustic pressure is largely used to monitor explosive activity at volcanoes and has become one of the most promising technique to monitor volcanoes also at large scale. However , no clear relation between the fluid dynamics of explosive eruptions and the associated acoustic signals has yet been defined. Linear acoustic has been applied to derive source parameters in the case of strong explosive eruptions which are well-known to be driven by large overpressure of the magmatic fluids. Asymmetric acoustic waveforms are generally considered as the evidence for supersonic explosive dynamics also for small explosive regimes. We have used Lattice-Boltzmann modeling of the eruptive fluid dynamics to analyse the acoustic wavefield produced by different flow regimes. We demonstrate that acoustic waveform well reproduces the flow dynamics of a subsonic fluid injection related to discrete explosive events. Different volumetric flow rate , at low-Mach regimes , can explain both the observed symmetric and asymmetric waveform. Hence , asymmetric waveforms are not necessarily related to the shock/supersonic fluid dynamics of the source. As a result , we highlight an ambiguity in the general interpretation of volcano acoustic signals for the retrieval of key eruption source parameters , necessary for a reliable volcanic hazard assessment.
