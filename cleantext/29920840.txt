  Idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( IPF) is a genetic heterogeneous disease with high mortality and poor prognosis. However , a large fraction of genetic cause remains unexplained , especially in sporadic IPF ( ∼ 80 % IPF). By systemically reviewing related literature and potential pathogenic pathways , 92 potentially IPF-related genes were selected and sequenced in genomic DNAs from 253 sporadic IPF patients and 125 matched health controls using targeted massively parallel next-generation sequencing. The identified risk variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. We identified two pathogenic and 10 loss-of-function ( LOF) candidate variants , accounting for 4.74 % ( 12 out of 253) of all the IPF cases. In burden tests , rare missense variants in three genes ( CSF3R , DSP , and LAMA3) were identified that have a statistically significant relationship with IPF. Four common SNPs ( rs3737002 , rs2296160 , rs1800470 , and rs35705950) were observed to be statistically associated with increased risk of IPF. In the cumulative risk model , high risk subjects had 3.47-fold ( 95 % CI: 2.07-5.81 , P = 2.34 × 10
