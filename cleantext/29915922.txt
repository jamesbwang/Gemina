  Therapeutic drug monitoring studies have generally concentrated on controlling compliance and avoiding side effects by maintaining long-term exposure to minimally effective blood concentrations. The rationale for using therapeutic drug monitoring in relation to second-generation antipsychotics is still being discussed at least with regard to the real clinical utility , but there is evidence that it can improve efficacy , especially when patients do not respond or develop side effects using therapeutic doses. Furthermore , drug plasma concentration determinations can be of some utility in medico-legal problems. This review concentrates on the clinical pharmacokinetic data related to clozapine , risperidone , paliperidone , olanzapine , quetiapine , amisulpride , ziprasidone , aripiprazole , sertindole , asenapine , iloperidone , lurasidone , brexpiprazole and cariprazine and briefly considers the main aspects of their pharmacodynamics. Optimal plasma concentration ranges are proposed for clozapine , risperidone , paliperidone and olanzapine because the studies of quetiapine , amisulpride , asenapine , iloperidone and lurasidone provide only limited information and there is no direct evidence concerning ziprasidone , aripiprazole , sertindole , brexpiprazole and cariprazine: the few reported investigations need to be confirmed and extended.
