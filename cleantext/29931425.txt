  Several studies have provided evidence on the prognostic relevance of circulating tumor cells ( CTCs) detected before and after chemotherapy regarding overall survival ( OS) and progression-free survival ( PFS) in early breast cancer ( EBC). We provide data on the prevalence of CTCs 2 and 5 years after primary diagnosis in a cohort of patients with EBC. The SUCCESS study is a multicenter , prospective , randomized trial comparing PFS in primary breast cancer patients undergoing one of two adjuvant chemotherapy regimens followed by 2 versus 5 years of treatment with zoledronate. CTCs from patients without signs of breast cancer recurrence were analyzed in peripheral blood using the FDA cleared CellSearch Â® System ( Veridex , USA) 2 and 5 years after primary diagnosis. CTCs were detected at 2 and 5 years after primary diagnosis in 96 ( 16.7 %) and 47 ( 8.2 %) of the 574 patients , respectively. There were no associations between CTC status and patient and tumor characteristics or treatment regimens. In 442 ( 77.0 %) patients , no CTCs were detected at either of the two time points , and in 11 patients ( 1.9 %) , CTCs were found at both 2 and 5 years after primary diagnosis. In 85 ( 14.8 %) patients , CTCs were present 2 years after primary diagnosis but not after 5 years , while 36 ( 6.3 %) patients had CTCs in their blood only at the 5-year follow-up. In patients with EBC , CTCs can be detected even 5 years after primary diagnosis without clinical signs of disease recurrence.
