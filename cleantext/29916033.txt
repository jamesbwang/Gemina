  The life and works of neurologist and psychiatrist Kurt Goldstein ( 1878-1965) were almost forgotten for decades but have aroused increasing interest in recent years. Studies on Goldstein generally focus on his groundbreaking contributions to a holistic neurology , neuropsychology and neurorehabilitation; however , his contributions to the development of psychotherapy have received less attention. The present article reviews Goldstein 's substantial input to the development of psychotherapy , and especially of humanistic psychotherapies. It is further shown how these contributions are rooted in Goldstein 's observations on brain-damaged World War I veterans. From these observations Goldstein derived a holistic view of the organism as a system that embodies and constantly re-establishes an identity , thereby also defining the meaning of anxiety<symptom> for human existence and drawing conclusions for the therapeutic relationship. It can therefore be argued that brain research impinged on the development of psychotherapy at an early stage , even though its research paradigm differed profoundly from that of present day reductionism.
