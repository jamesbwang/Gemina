  Older kidney transplant recipients experience increased rates of infection and death , and less rejection , compared with younger patients. However , little is known about immune dysfunction in older compared with younger kidney transplant recipients and whether it is associated with infection. We evaluated T cell phenotypes including maturation , immune senescence , and exhaustion<symptom> in a novel investigation into differences in older compared with younger patients receiving identical immune suppression regimens. We evaluated PBMC from 60 kidney transplant recipients ( 23 older and 37 matched younger patients) by multiparameter immune phenotyping. Older kidney transplant recipients demonstrated decreased frequency of na√Øve CD4 + and CD8 + T cells , and increased frequency of terminally differentiated , immune senescent , and NK T cells expressing KLRG1. There was a trend towards increased frequency of T cell immune senescence in patients experiencing infection in the first year after transplantation , which reached statistical significance in a multivariate analysis. This pilot study reveals immune dysfunction in older compared with younger transplant recipients , and suggests a likely mechanism for increased vulnerability to infection. The ability to assess T cell maturation and immune senescence in transplant recipients offers the potential for risk stratification and customization of immune suppression to prevent infection and rejection after transplantation.
