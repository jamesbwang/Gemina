  This chapter presents an outline of the recent available information regarding safety , toxicity , and efficacy of nano drug delivery systems. Of particular importance is the evaluation of several key factors to design nontoxic and effective nanoformulations. Among them , we focus on nanostructure materials and synthesis methods , mechanisms of interactions with biological systems , treatment of nanoparticles , manufacture impurities , and nanostability. Emphasis is given to in silico , in vitro , and in vivo models used to assess and predict the toxicity of these new formulations. Additionally , some examples of in vitro and in vivo studies of specific nanoderivatives are also presented in this chapter.
