  Pediatric cataract is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease which is a significant cause of lifelong visual impairment and treatable blindness<symptom>. Our study aims to investigate the genotype spectrum in a group of Chinese patients with pediatric cataract. We enrolled 39 families with pediatric cataract from October 2015 to April 2016. DNA samples of the probands were analyzed by target next-generation sequencing. Variants were validated using Sanger sequencing in the probands and available family members. In our cohort of 39 cases with different types of pediatric cataract , 23 cases were found to harbor putative pathogenic variants in 15 genes: CRYAA , CRYBA1 , CRYBA4 , CRYBB1 , CRYGC , CRYGD , MIP , GCNT2 , IARS2 , NHS , BCOR , BFSP2 , FYCO1 , MAF , and PAX6. The mutation detection rates in the familial and sporadic cases were 75 and 47.8 % , respectively. Of the 23 causative variants , over half were novel. This is a rare report of systematic mutation screening analysis of pediatric cataract in a comparably large cohort of Chinese patients. Our observations enrich the mutation spectrum of pediatric cataract. Next-generation sequencing provides significant diagnostic information for pediatric cataract cases , especially when considering sporadic and subtle syndromal cases.
