  Semaphorin-3a ( Sema3A) , a soluble axon guidance cue , appears to play an important role in the development of acute kidney injury ( AKI) and has been regarded as an early diagnostic marker to evaluate the progression of AKI. However , the role of Sema3A in sepsis-associated AKI remains unknown. In this study , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) was used to simulate sepsis-associated AKI and the role of Sema3A in LPS-induced AKI was investigated in vivo and in vitro. In our in vivo study , Sema3A was found in tubular epithelial cells ( TECs) , which presented a higher level after LPS treatment. Meanwhile , the results of our in vitro experiment showed that Sema3A was also elevated in NRK-52E cells treated by LPS. Notably , inhibition of Sema3A by (-)- epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG) could significantly reduce kidney inflammation<symptom> and apoptosis in mice. Likewise , EGCG intervention also ameliorated the inflammation<symptom> and apoptosis of cells in vitro. Furthermore , our research also found that the Rac1/NF-κB p65 and JNK pathways were possibly involved in the Sema3A-mediated inflammation<symptom> and apoptosis of TECs , respectively. Our findings suggest that Sema3A play a pathogenic role by promoting inflammation<symptom> and apoptosis of TECs in LPS-induced AKI. It might serve as a useful treatment target in ameliorating sepsis-associated AKI. Sema3A is upregulated in LPS-induced AKI. Inhibition of Sema3A attenuates inflammation<symptom> and apoptosis of TECs in LPS-induced AKI. Sema3A enhances the LPS-induced inflammation<symptom> of TECs through the Rac1/NF-κB p65 pathway. Sema3A exacerbates the LPS-induced apoptosis of TECs through the JNK pathway.
