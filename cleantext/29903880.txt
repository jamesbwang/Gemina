  Clinically relevant subtypes exist for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC) , but molecular characterization is not yet standard in clinical care. We implemented a biopsy protocol to perform time-sensitive whole exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing for patients with advanced PDAC. Therapeutically relevant genomic alterations were identified in 48 % ( 34/71) and pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline alterations in 18 % ( 13/71) of patients. Overall , 30 % ( 21/71) of enrolled patients experienced a change in clinical management as a result of genomic data. Twenty-six patients had germline and/or somatic alterations in DNA-damage repair genes , and 5 additional patients had mutational signatures of homologous recombination deficiency but no identified causal genomic alteration. Two patients had oncogenic in-frame BRAF deletions , and we report the first clinical evidence that this alteration confers sensitivity to MAP-kinase pathway inhibition. Moreover , we identified tumor/stroma gene expression signatures with clinical relevance. Collectively , these data demonstrate the feasibility and value of real-time genomic characterization of advanced PDAC.
