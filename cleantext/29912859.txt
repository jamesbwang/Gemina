J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-Hand paddles are one of the most common training aids used by the competitive swimmer , yet little is known regarding how hand paddle surface area affects the metabolic cost of transport ( COT) while swimming. The purpose of this study was to determine how altering hand paddle size affects energy use during submaximal , front-crawl ( i.e. , freestyle) swimming. Twenty-six proficient , adult swimmers ( 13 men and 13 women) completed six 3-minute trials in a flume at a constant pace ( 102 cm · s; 1:38 per 100 m). Trials were performed in random order , using 1 of 5 pairs of hand paddles of different sizes or no paddles at all. Paddle surface areas were 201 , 256 , 310 , 358 , and 391 cm per hand. Without paddles , COT , arm cadence , and distance per stroke were 7.87 ± 1.32 J · kg · m , 29.4 ± 4.9 min , and 2.13 ± 0.34 m , which corresponded to a rate of oxygen consumption ( V ( Combining Dot Above) O2) of 23.3 ± 3.7 ml · kg · min and a heart rate ( HR) of 118 ± 17 b · min. The use of larger hand paddles decreased COT , cadence , V ( Combining Dot Above) O2 , and HR and increased distance traveled per stroke ( all p < 0.001). However , the magnitude of the change of COT decreased as paddle size increased , indicating diminishing marginal return with increasing paddle surface area. The largest sized paddles increased COT per stroke compared with swimming without paddles ( p = 0.001). Therefore , results from this study suggest that an optimal hand paddle size exists ( 210-358 cm) for proficient , adult swimmers , which reduces COT without increasing COT per stroke.
