  For successful switching of bio-originators to biosimilars , confidence in the switch is an important criterion. To promote confidence , scientific evidence is critical , but still there are insufficient data for the majority of approved biosimilars. Areas covered: Scientific evidence for switching from bio-originator DMARDs to biosimilars is derived from randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) for switching , extension studies of RCTs for the approval process , and real-world observational studies. To identify candidate studies , PubMed was searched to collect appropriate studies in all approved biosimilars for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. In addition , abstracts for scientific meetings were reviewed to discover abstracts focused on switching. To date , we have identified 17 extension studies of RCTs , 1 RCT , and 17 real-world observational studies. Most real-world studies have originated from CT-P13 and SB4. Switching was definitively safe and effective in most of studies , but some nocebo effects were observed. Expert commentary: Clear guidelines for switching and data from post-marketing surveillance and registries will be required to confirm existing results on the safety and efficacy of switching from bio-originators to biosimilars. To lessen the nocebo effect against biosimilars , effective educational programs should be provided for all stakeholders , including patients and physicians.
