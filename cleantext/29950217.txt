  To analyze the incidence of bone<disease> marrow involvement in patients with different pathological types of lymphoma. The results of bone<disease> marrow tests including bone<disease> marrow aspiration ( BMA) , flow cytometry detection , bone<disease> marrow biopsy ( BMB) and The incidence of bone<disease> marrow involvement ( BMI) in the patients with NHL was much higher than that in patients with HL ( 32.6 % ( 201/616) vs 15 % ( 13/86)) ( P < 0.05). For patients with NHL , the incidence of bone<disease> marrow involvement in B-cell lymphoma was higher than that in T-cell lymphoma ( 37.0 % vs 22.6 %) ( P < 0.05). According to different pathological types , the incidences of BMI in the patient with mantle cell lymphoma , hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma , diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) and follical lymphoma ( FL) were 88 % ( 25/22) , 100 % ( 5/5) , 21.8 % ( 56/257) , and 38.5 % ( 15/39) , respectively. The incidence of bone<disease> marrow involvement varies in different pathological types of lymphoma.Bone marrow assessment has significant importance for stading of newly diagnosed lymphoma patients.
