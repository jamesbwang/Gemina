  Two new alkaloid glycosides ( 1-2) , two new amide alkaloids ( 3 and 6) , and two new amine alkaloids ( 4 and 5) , were isolated from Scindapsus officinalis ( Roxb.) Schott. , along with four known alkaloids ( 7-10). Structural elucidation of the isolated compounds was established by spectroscopic analysis , especially 2D NMR techniques and comparison with literatures. The absolute configurations of compounds 1 and 2 were determined by the electronic circular dichroism calculations. Compound 1 represent the first example of alkaloid glycoside found to possess an unprecedented 2,5-methanocyclopenta ( b) azepine core. All isolates were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 human breast cancer cell and anti-inflammatory activity against nitric oxide ( NO) production in vitro. Compounds 4 , 6 and 8 demonstrated moderate cytotoxic effects against MCF-7 cell ( IC
