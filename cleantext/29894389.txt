  To determine whether national antiretroviral therapy ( ART) coverage is associated with changes in elderly living arrangements. Retrospective analysis using 103 nationally representative surveys from 28 African countries between 1991 and 2015. The sample consisted of individuals aged at least 60 years old. We investigated how three measures of living arrangements of older people have changed with ART coverage: ( i) the number of older individuals living without prime-age adults; ( ii) the number of older individuals living with only dependent children ( i.e. , `` missing generation '' households); and ( iii) the number of prime-age adults per household where an elderly individual lives. Sample size was 297,331 elderly individuals. An increase in ART coverage of 1 % was associated with a 0.7 percentage point ( p < .001) reduction in the probability of an elderly individual living without prime-age adult and a 0.2 percentage point ( p = .005) reduction in the probability of an elderly individual living in a `` missing generation '' household in HIV<pathogen> endemic countries. Increases in ART coverage were also associated with more prime-age adults in households with at least one older person. In our study countries , representing 75 % ( 749 million) of the sub-Saharan population , an additional 103,000- 358,000 elderly individuals could be living with prime-age adults as a result of increased ART coverage ( 1 %). The scale up of ART is linked to substantial changes in the living arrangements of elderly people in Africa. Estimates of the returns to investments in HIV<pathogen> treatment may be inaccurate without taking into account these larger societal consequences.
