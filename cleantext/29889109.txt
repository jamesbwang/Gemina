  Diaphragmatic eventeration is a rare congenital anomaly consisting of defect of diaphragm muscular development , which can be diagnosed with chest radiography and clinical evaluation. Diaphragmatic plication is a well-established treatment for diaphragmatic eventeration , which can be done through the thoracic or abdominal route , and minimally invasive became the trend in recent years. The study retrospectively analyzed 3 cases of diaphragmatic eventeration with the procedure of laparoscopic diaphragmatic plication with mesh repair from August 2016 to April 2017. A detailed review of medical records and the perioperative data including patient characteristics , operative details , and postoperative hospital stay was conducted. Laparoscopic diaphragmatic plication with mesh repair for diaphragmatic eventeration was successfully completed for 3 patients. The mean operation time was 125 minutes ( range , 120 to 135 min) , and the mean blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was 13.3 mL ( range , 10 to 15 mL). The postoperative intercostal neuralgia was detailed evaluated and intervention as necessary. All patients were followed up at 1 , 3 , and 6 months after procedure , and the recoveries were uneventful. Laparoscopic diaphragmatic plication with mesh repair provides a new operative view , which may be a safe and feasible alternative in the surgical management of diaphragmatic eventeration.
