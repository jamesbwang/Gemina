  The development of colorectal cancer is affected by many factors , especially the intestinal microbiota. However , precise knowledge of bacterial communities associated with the mucosa in various parts of the colon is limited. Herein , we applied the gentamicin protection assay and detected the presence of intracellular bacteria in colorectal biopsies from Slovak patients with colorectal adenoma and carcinoma , and we compared this with healthy controls. The ENTEROtest 24 and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identified the cultivated bacteria and results revealed the presence of intracellularly localized Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , Proteus<pathogen> mirabilis<pathogen> and Proteus<pathogen> vulgaris<pathogen> in patients with colorectal adenomas and carcinomas. In addition to these species , Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> , Enterococcus<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> and Bacillus<pathogen> cereus<pathogen> were identified in colorectal biopsies , but these were extracellular. The marked increase in relative abundance of intracellular E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in patients with colorectal adenomas and carcinomas was statistically significant compared to controls , and our preliminary data supports E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> 's role as a pro-oncogenic pathogen.
