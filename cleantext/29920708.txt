  This article is part of a project investigating the interfacing of clinically and research-generated knowledge in the field of infant mental health ( IMH) with local cultural models of child care and development. The article explores the experiences and challenges reported by psychology-trained supervisors in supervision with local , lay , trained home visitors. Supervisors and supervisees were drawn from two early intervention programs which apply relational IMH mental health models in socioeconomically deprived townships in South Africa. Literature that considers supervisors ' experiences of conducting supervision with lay counselors has been limited , and even more so in settings where there are marked cultural and contextual differences between supervisors and supervisees. These differences pose particular challenges regarding the finding of a shared theoretical understanding of the work as well as to the establishment of a secure working alliance. While it was found that psychoanalytic and attachment-informed theories of infant development are applicable in these South African settings , differences in race , language , education , socioeconomic status , and culture between supervisors and supervisees challenge the supervisor-supervisee relationship and require psychological processing and creative solutions to ensure integrity in the application of the model.
