  Anemia<symptom> , iron deficiency ( ID) , and iron deficiency anemia<symptom> ( IDA) among young children are public health concerns in developing countries. We evaluated the effects of small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements ( LNSs) and micronutrient powder ( MNP) on anemia<symptom> , ID , and IDA in 18-mo-old Bangladeshi children. We enrolled 4011 pregnant women in a cluster-randomized effectiveness trial with 4 arms-1) LNS-LNS: LNSs ( including 20 mg Fe) for women daily during pregnancy and 6 mo postpartum and LNSs ( including 9 mg Fe) for children daily from 6 to 24 mo of age ( LNS-C); 2) IFA-LNS: iron ( 60 mg) and folic acid ( IFA) for women daily during pregnancy and every other day for 3 mo postpartum and LNS-C for children; 3) IFA-MNP: IFA for women , and MNP ( including 10 mg Fe) for children daily from 6 to 24 mo; and 4) IFA-Control: IFA for women and no child supplement. Hemoglobin , serum ferritin , and soluble transferrin receptor ( sTfR) were assessed in a subsample of children ( n = 1121) at 18 mo to identify anemia<symptom> ( hemoglobin < 110g/L) , ID ( ferritin < 12 Âµg/L or sTfR > 8.3 mg/L) , and IDA. Data were analyzed with the use of mixed-effects modeling. Compared with the IFA-Control arm , hemoglobin was higher in the LNS-LNS and IFA-LNS arms and ferritin was higher and sTfR was lower in the LNS-LNS , IFA-LNS , and IFA-MNP arms; LNS-LNS children had reduced odds of anemia<symptom> ( OR: 0.46; 95 % CI: 0.25 , 0.84) , high sTfR ( OR: 0.47; 95 % CI: 0.29 , 0.73) , and ID ( OR: 0.45; 95 % CI: 0.28 , 0.71); and all 3 groups had lower odds of low ferritin ( corrected for inflammation<symptom>; OR ( 95 % CI)- LNS-LNS: 0.29 ( 0.13 , 0.63); IFA-LNS: 0.25 ( 0.11 , 0.59); and IFA-MNP: 0.37 ( 0.18 , 0.76)) and IDA ( LNS-LNS: 0.35 ( 0.18 , 0.67); IFA-LNS: 0.45 ( 0.24,0.85); and IFA-MNP: 0.47 ( 0.26 , 0.87)). Home fortification using LNSs or MNP reduced IDA in 18-mo-old Bangladeshi children. The provision of LNSs in both pregnancy and childhood also reduced child anemia<symptom> and ID. These findings are relevant to programs targeting similar populations. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01715038.
