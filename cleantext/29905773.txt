  Exposure to bisphenol A ( BPA) can be assessed using external and internal exposure measures. We examined the relationship between two measures of external BPA exposure ( air and hand-wipe samples) and one of internal exposure ( total BPA in urine) for a group of US manufacturing workers. During 2013-2014 , we recruited 78 workers from six US companies that made BPA or made products with BPA. We quantified BPA in seven urine samples , two full-shift air samples and in pre- and end-shift hand-wipe samples collected from workers over 2 consecutive days. We examined correlations between creatinine-corrected urinary concentrations of total BPA ( total BPACR) and BPA levels in air and hand wipes using Pearson 's correlation coefficient. We also applied mixed-effects regression models to examine the relationship between total BPACR with BPA in air ( urine ~ air model) and with BPA in end-shift hand wipes ( urine ~ hand model) , separately and together ( urine ~ air + hand model) , after adjusting for covariates. End-shift total BPACR strongly correlated with BPA in air ( rp = 0.79 , P < 0.0001) and nearly as strongly with BPA in end-shift hand wipes ( rp = 0.75 , P < 0.0001). In mixed-effect models , BPA air concentration and end-shift hand-wipe BPA level were significantly and positively associated with end-shift total BPACR ( P < 0.0001 each). We found a significant effect of the Day 1 BPA air concentration on Day 2 total BPACR ( P = 0.0104). When BPA air concentration and end-shift hand-wipe BPA level were in the same model , the air concentration ( P < 0.0001) was more significant than the hand-wipe level ( P = 0.0106). BPA levels in air and end-shift hand wipes strongly correlated with total BPACR , suggesting that both inhalation and dermal contract were likely exposure routes; however , inhalation , on average , appeared to be a more dominant exposure route than dermal contact for these manufacturing workers.
