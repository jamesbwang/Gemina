  Wild birds are natural hosts of avian influenza<disease> viruses ( AIV) and can transmit viruses to poultry and other species. To monitor the prevalence of AIV antibodies , 211 eggs from wild Mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos) and 177 from wild White-winged Terns ( Chlidonias leucopterus) were collected from Zhalong Wetland and Xianghai Wetland in northeastern Republic of China from April to September , 2016. A hemagglutinin inhibition test detected the presence of H1 , H3 , H5 , and H7 subtype-specific antibodies. The prevalences of AIV antibodies of subtypes H1 and H3 were relatively high while the prevalences of H5 and H7 AIV subtype antibody were low. In Zhalong Wetland , the prevalence of H1 AIV subtype antibody in Mallards was the highest , with a percentage of 11.0 %. Prevalence of all AIV subtype-specific antibodies in Mallard was higher than those in White-winged Terns.
