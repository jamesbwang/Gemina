  This feasibility study of text-mining-based scoring algorithm provides an objective comparison of structured reports ( SR) and conventional free-text reports ( cFTR) by means of guideline-based key terms. Furthermore , an open-source online version of this ranking algorithm was provided with multilingual text-retrieval pipeline , customizable query and real-time-scoring. Twenty-five patients with suspected stroke and magnetic resonance imaging were re-assessed by two independent/blinded readers ( inexperienced: 3 years; experienced > 6 years/Board-certified). SR and cFTR were compared with guideline-query using the cosine similarity score ( CSS) and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. All pathological findings ( 18/18) were identified by SR and cFTR. The impressions section of the SRs of the inexperienced reader had the highest median ( 0.145) and maximal ( 0.214) CSS and were rated significantly higher ( p = 2.21 Ã— 10 Objective guideline-based comparison of SRs and cFTRs using the CSS is feasible and provides a scalable quality measure that can facilitate the adoption of structured reports in all fields of radiology.
