  The possibility of using the atomic coordinates of protein-ligand complexes to assess binding affinity has a beneficial impact in the early stages of drug development and design. From the computational view , the creation of reliable scoring functions is still an open problem in the simulation of biological systems , and the development of a new generation machine-learning model is an active research field. In this work , we propose a novel scoring function to predict Gibbs free energy of binding ( ΔG) based on the crystallographic structure of complexes involving a protein and an active ligand. We made use of the energy terms available the AutoDock Vina scoring function and trained a novel function using the machine learning methods available in the program SAnDReS. We used a training set composed exclusively of high-resolution crystallographic structures for which the ΔG data was available. We describe here the methodology to develop a machine-learning model to predict binding affinity using the program SAnDReS. Statistical analysis of our machine-learning model indicated a superior performance when compared to the MolDock , Plants , AutoDock 4 , and AutoDock Vina scoring functions. We expect that this new machine-learning model could improve drug design and development through the application of a reliable scoring function in the analysis virtual screening simulations.
