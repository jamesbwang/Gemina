  Biochar , as a soil amendment in agriculture , has attracted considerable attention. In the study , the fate and toxicity of the herbicide fenoxaprop-ethyl were evaluated in soils with and without 5 % rice husk biochar amendment. Fenoxaprop-ethyl and metabolite fenoxaprop degradation followed first-order kinetics in the two soils. Fenoxaprop-ethyl decreased fast with half-lives less than 2 days. Large amounts of fenoxaprop formed and remained in the control soil. However , fenoxaprop was much lower in the biochar-amended soil with reduction over 85 % on the 35th day. The estimated half-lives of fenoxaprop were 56.9 and 1.5 days in the control and biochar-amended soils , respectively. Biochar restrained the formation and promoted the dissipation of fenoxaprop.
