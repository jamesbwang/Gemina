  Epidemiological studies on pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease ( PIBD) are scarce in South-East Asia ( SEA). This study aimed to evaluate the incidence trend and clinical characteristics of PIBD in a SEA cohort in Singapore over 22 years ( 1994-2015). Case records of PIBD â‰¤ 18 years from the only two tertiary pediatric hospitals in Singapore were reviewed. The mean annual incidence ( MAI) of PIBD was calculated based on Singapore 's age-specific population data. Overall MAI of PIBD was 1.26 per 100000 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.56-1.96). During the first decade ( 1994-2004) MAI was 0.23 per 100000 ( 95 % CI 0.08-0.39); this rose almost 10-fold to 2.28 per 100000 ( 95 % CI 1.15-3.41) during the second decade ( 2005-2015). Linear regression analysis showed significant increase in MAI over the 22-year period ( r = 0.826 , P < 0001). Of the 228 patients , 61.0 % had Crohn 's disease ( CD) , 30.3 % ulcerative colitis<disease> and 8.7 % IBD-unclassified , with a mdian age at diagnosis of 10.47 years and a male predominance ( 58.3 %); 37.7 % of them aged < 10 years at diagnosis and 17.5 % were very early-onset IBD. In CD , 27.3 % had stricturing and/or penetrating disease and 21.6 % were with perianal disease. Indians had a disproportionately high representation while positive family history was rare ( 1.3 %). Although PIBD is uncommon in Singapore , its incidence has risen dramatically over recent decades. A younger age of disease onset and higher proportions of perianal and stricturing/penetrating diseases suggest more aggressive disease than in Western data.
