  There is a body of empirical literature indicating that interprofessional education ( IPE) not only enriches students ' understanding of their own discipline but of other disciplines. However , giving the on-going emphasis on the importance of IPE to healthcare processes and outcomes , on-going attention is needed to advancing the research evidence related to the emergency department setting. The aim of this qualitative descriptive study was to determine the clinical learning experiences of GPs who rotated through an academic urban minor injuries unit as part of their training , led by advanced nurse practitioners ( emergency). Data were drawn from semi-structured interviews of sixty to ninety minutes duration with 5 general practitioners ( GPs) who completed the trainee rotation practicum in an academic urban minor injuries unit led by advanced nurse practitioners ( ANPs) emergency. The GPs indicated that their knowledge translation of minor injuries to practice was connected to their utilisation of algorithm rules and case management processes modelled by ANPs ( emergency). The outcome of this process reported by GPs brought notable reductions to their referral of patients with minor injuries to emergency departments. Interprofessional learning in clinical practice with ANPs ( emergency) was seen as a valuable role making model for the trainee GPs who are now employed in primary care.
