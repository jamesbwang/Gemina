  Mechanical metamaterials with three-dimensional micro- and nanoarchitectures exhibit unique mechanical properties , such as high specific modulus , specific strength , and energy absorption. However , a conflict exists between strength and recoverability in nearly all the mechanical metamaterials reported recently , in particular the architected micro/nanolattices , which restricts the applications of these materials in energy storage/absorption and mechanical actuation. Here , we demonstrated the fabrication of three-dimensional architected composite nanolattices that overcome the strength-recoverability trade-off. The nanolattices under study are made up of a high-entropy alloy-coated ( 14.2-126.1 nm in thickness) polymer strut ( approximately 260 nm in the characteristic size) fabricated via two-photon lithography and magnetron sputtering deposition. In situ uniaxial compression inside a scanning electron microscope showed that these composite nanolattices exhibit a high specific strength of 0.027 MPa/kg m
