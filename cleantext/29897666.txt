  Essentials New VWF activity assays are increasingly used but information on their comparability is limited. This is an ISTH SSC-organized study ( expert labs , 5 countries) to compare all available assays. VWF activity by six assays correlated well with each other. The new assays show improved characteristics- minor differences are noted. Background Several new assays have become available to measure von Willebrand factor ( VWF) activity. The new assays appear to have improved performance characteristics compared with the old reference standard , ristocetin cofactor activity ( VWF: RCo) , but information is limited about how they compare with VWF: RCo and each other. Methods The von Willebrand factor Subcommittee of the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis ( ISTH) Scientific and Standardization Committee ( SSC) designed a collaborative study involving expert laboratories from several countries to compare available tests with each other and with VWF: RCo. Eight laboratories from five countries were provided with blinded samples from normal healthy individuals and well-characterized clinical cases. Laboratories measured VWF activity using all tests available to them; data from six laboratories , not affected by thawing during transportation , are included in this study. Results All tests correlated well with VWF: RCo activity ( r-values ranged from 0.963 to 0.989). Slightly steeper regression lines for VWF: Ab and VWF: GPIbM were clinically insignificant. The new assays showed improved performance characteristics. Of the commercially available assays , the VWF: GPIbR using the AcuStar system was the most sensitive and could reliably detect VWF activity below 1 IU dL
