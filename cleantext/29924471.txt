  Quantitative prediction of the magnitude of transporter-mediated clinical drug-drug interactions ( DDIs) solely from in vitro inhibition data remains challenging. The objective of the present work was to analyze kinetic profile of an endogenous biomarker for organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B ( OATP1B) , coproporphyrin I ( CPI) , and to predict clinical DDIs with a probe OATP1B substrate ( pravastatin) based on `` in vivo '' inhibition constants ( K
