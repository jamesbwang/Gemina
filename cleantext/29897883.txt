  Betalains are water soluble plant pigments in plants of the order Caryophyllales , which are widely used as colorants. Several preclinical studies reported that betanin reveals antioxidants , anti-inflammatory , hepatoprotective , anticancer , anti-diabetes , anti-lipid emic , antimicrobial activity , radio protective and anti-proliferative activity. They are isolated from sources such as red beetroot , amaranth , prickly pear , red pitahaya , etc.. Betalains are divided into two groups based on the colour and confer either the betacyanins ( purple reddish) or betaxanthins ( yellowish orange). Betalain is one of the promising nutraceuticals which can provide beneficial effects for prevention and cure of various diseases. The purpose of this review is to focus on nutraceutical facts of betalains by focusing on the ongoing treatment using betalains and to address its future nutraceuticals implications.
