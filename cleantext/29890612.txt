  An important concern regarding sites contaminated with polycyclic aromatic compounds ( PACs) is the risk of groundwater contamination by release of the compounds from soils. The goal of this study was to investigate the occurrence and leachability of 77 PACs including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) and heterocyclic aromatic compounds ( NSO-PACs) among total aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR) agonists in soils from historical contaminated sites. A novel approach combining chemical and bioanalytical methods in combination with characterization of leachability by use of a column leaching test was used. Similar profiles of relative concentrations of PACs were observed in all soils , with parent PAHs accounting for 71 to 90 % of total concentrations in soils. Contribution of oxy-PAHs , alkyl-PAHs and N-PACs ranged from 2 to 9 % , 3 to 9 % and 1 to 14 % , respectively. Although the contributions of groups of PACs were small , some compounds were found in similar or greater concentrations than parent PAHs. Leachable fractions of 77 PACs from soils were small and ranged from 0.002 to 0.54 %. Polar PACs were shown to be more leachable than parent PAHs. The contribution of analyzed PACS to overall AhR-mediated activities in soils and leachates suggests presence of other AhR agonists in soils , and a potential risk. Only a small fraction of AhR agonists was available in soils , indicating an overestimation of the risk if only total initial concentrations in soils would be considered in risk assessment. The results of the study strongly support that focus on 16US EPA PAHs may result in inadequate assessment of risk and hazard of PACs in complex environmental samples.
