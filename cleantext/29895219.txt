  High-speed single-molecule fluorescence microscopy in vivo shows that transcription factors in eukaryotes can act in oligomeric clusters mediated by molecular crowding and intrinsically disordered protein. This finding impacts on the longstanding puzzle of how transcription factors find their gene targets so efficiently in the complex , heterogeneous environment of the cell.
