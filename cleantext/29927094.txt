  Liquid chromatography ( LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ( MS/MS) has enabled researchers to analyze complex biological samples with unprecedented depth. It facilitates the identification and quantification of modifications within thousands of proteins in a single large-scale proteomic experiment. Analysis of phosphorylation , one of the most common and important post-translational modifications , has particularly benefited from such progress in the field. Here , detailed protocols are provided for a few well-regarded , common sample preparation methods for an effective phosphoproteomic experiment. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
