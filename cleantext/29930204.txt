  In most tissues , anchorage-dependent growth and cell cycle progression are dependent on cells engaging extracellular matrices ( ECMs) via integrin-receptor adhesion complexes. In a highly conserved manner , cells disassemble adhesion complexes , round up , and retract from their surroundings before division , suggestive of a primordial link between the cell cycle machinery and the regulation of cell adhesion to the ECM. In this study , we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( CDK1) mediates this link. CDK1 , in complex with cyclin A2 , promotes adhesion complex and actin cytoskeleton organization during interphase and mediates a large increase in adhesion complex area as cells transition from G1 into S. Adhesion complex area decreases in G2 , and disassembly occurs several hours before mitosis. This loss requires elevated cyclin B1 levels and is caused by inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1-cyclin complexes. The inactivation of CDK1 is therefore the trigger that initiates remodeling of adhesion complexes and the actin cytoskeleton in preparation for rapid entry into mitosis.
