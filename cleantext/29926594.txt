  To investigate the effects of different intensity exercise combined with resveratrol on retinol binding protein 4 ( RBP4) mRNA and protein expression in visceral adipose tissue and plasma RBP4 concentration of aged obese rats. Eighty male SD rats aged 3 weeks were randomly divided into the control group and the experimental group. Rats of the control group ( C) were fed with ordinary feed of 6 % fat ( Compared with normal ( C) group , the expressions of RBP4 mRNA and protein and plasma concentration and plasma glucose of the model ( CO) group were increased obviously ( Different intensities exercise combined with resveratrol could reduce the RBP4 mRNA and protein expression in visceral adipose tissue and plasma RBP4 concentrations of aged obese rats , but less affected by exercise intensity.
