  A complete-airway in vitro model would be very useful for toxicological dosimetry testing and for developing targeted inhaled medications in cases where conducting in vivo experiments are exceedingly difficult , as with infants. The objective of this study was to determine whether packed bed in vitro models , which contain spheres as the primary repeating unit , provide a realistic representation of aerosol deposition in the tracheobronchial region of infant lungs based on computational fluid dynamics ( CFD) predictions. The packed bed ( PB) CFD model contained an inlet consistent with airway bifurcation B3 ( âˆ¼ lobar bronchi) leading to a spherical array with voids between the spheres forming a divided flow pathway. The hydrodynamic diameter of the voids was approximately matched to the diameter of bifurcations in various lung regions. For comparison , a CFD stochastic individual pathway ( SIP) geometry with realistic bifurcations extending from B4-B15 ( terminal bronchioles) was selected as an anatomically accurate model. The CFD-SIP model predictions were benchmarked with existing algebraic correlations for aerosol deposition in the lungs and found to be reasonable. Unfortunately , the CFD-PB model did not provide a good representation of aerosol deposition in the tracheobronchial region of human lungs. Through careful selection of the PB sphere size and inlet conditions , total deposition in the CFD-PB model matched CFD-SIP deposition within 10 % absolute error across a range of relevant aerosol sizes. However , regional deposition within the CFD-PB model was very different from the CFD-SIP case. Therefore , the PB approach can not be recommended for determining spatial or temporal distribution of aerosol transport and impaction deposition through the lungs.
