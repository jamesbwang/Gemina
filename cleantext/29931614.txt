  Plant growth and photosynthetic activity are usually inhibited due to the overall action of Cd on a whole organism , though few cadmium cations can invade chloroplasts in vivo. We found that in vivo , the major portion of Cd in barley chloroplasts is located in the thylakoids ( 80 %) , and the minor portion is in the stroma ( 20 %). Therefore , the electron-transport chain in the thylakoids would be the likely target for direct Cd action in vivo. In vitro , we found the distribution of Cd to be shifted to the stroma ( 40-60 %). In barley chloroplasts , the major portions of Mg , Fe , Mn , and Cu were found to be located in the thylakoids , and most Ca , Zn , and K in the stroma. This finding was true for both control and Cu- or Fe-treated plants. Treatment with Cd affected the contents of all cations , and the largest portions of Ca and Zn were in the thylakoids. Alterations of the K and Mn contents were caused by Cd , Cu , or Fe treatment; the levels of other cations in chloroplasts were changed specifically by Cd treatment. The quantity of Cd in chloroplasts was small in comparison to that of Mg , Ca , and Fe. In thylakoids , the amount of Cd was similar to that of Cu and comparable to the levels of Zn and Mn. Accordingly , the possible targets for direct Cd action in thylakoids are the Mn cluster , plastocyanin , carbonic anhydrase , or FtsH protease. The quantity of Cd in thylakoids is sufficient to replace a cation nearly completely at one of these sites or partially ( 20-30 %) at many of these sites.
