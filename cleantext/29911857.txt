  Extracellular vesicles are categorized in subsets according to their biogenesis processes. To facilitate the investigation of subsets , an effective method is needed for isolating subpopulations. The efficacy of existing density and size-based isolation methods is limited , and as a result , the correlation of properties within separated subpopulations is modest. Here , we introduced size separation with âˆ¼ 48 nm resolution that exploits Marangoni flow and the coffee-ring effect in microdroplets in which extracellular vesicles are spatially deposited at different location according to size of extracellular vesicle. Interestingly , the analysis of tetraspanin proteins of the extracellular vesicles facilitated by this method reveals that the size of extracellular vesicles is correlated with expression of tetraspanin proteins ( CD9 , CD63 , CD81) that are associated with the size of extracellular vesicles. The findings show that CD9 and CD81 are uniformly expressed regardless of size , CD63 is highly expressed only in larger extracellular vesicles. This evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles can be classified based on size and expression of CD63.
