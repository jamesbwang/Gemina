  In the clinical setting , the nocebo phenomenon is where clinical worsening or adverse events occur as a response to a treatment , in a situation in which conditioning from previous treatment exposure and/or expectations of sickness or symptoms lead to sickness and symptoms in a conditioned or expectant individual. The nocebo response may thus be a confounder in clinical treatment and clinical research. There is a need to know how to predict if an individual is likely to be a nocebo responder , and how significant and commonplace the nocebo effect might be. An analysis was conducted on nine placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trials of olanzapine for the treatment of bipolar disorder using data from placebo-treated study participants only. Data were analysed to identify participant or study characteristics associated with a nocebo event , defined as any treatment-emergent adverse event ( TEAE) or an increase in score from baseline to endpoint for primary measures of clinical symptoms. A total of 1185 participants were randomized to placebo , of whom 806 ( 68 %) reported a TEAE. Hamilton Depression<symptom> Rating Scale ( HDRS) data were only available for 649 placebo-treated participants , of whom 321 ( 49.5 %) demonstrated worsening. Nocebo events were significantly associated with: not being treatment-na√Øve , younger age , being located in the USA , being a participant in an earlier study , and being classified as obese compared with normal weight. A pattern to identify nocebo responders did not emerge , although some prognostic variables were associated with a greater probability of nocebo response. There was some evidence to support the role of expectancy as a cause of nocebo reactions.
