  Cost-sensitive feature selection learning is an important preprocessing step in machine learning and data mining. Recently , most existing cost-sensitive feature selection algorithms are heuristic algorithms , which evaluate the importance of each feature individually and select features one by one. Obviously , these algorithms do not consider the relationship among features. In this paper , we propose a new algorithm for minimal cost feature selection called the rough sets and Laplacian score based cost-sensitive feature selection. The importance of each feature is evaluated by both rough sets and Laplacian score. Compared with heuristic algorithms , the proposed algorithm takes into consideration the relationship among features with locality preservation of Laplacian score. We select a feature subset with maximal feature importance and minimal cost when cost is undertaken in parallel , where the cost is given by three different distributions to simulate different applications. Different from existing cost-sensitive feature selection algorithms , our algorithm simultaneously selects out a predetermined number of `` good '' features. Extensive experimental results show that the approach is efficient and able to effectively obtain the minimum cost subset. In addition , the results of our method are more promising than the results of other cost-sensitive feature selection algorithms.
