  This work deals with the controlled nucleation of aniline from the isolated molecule until formation of a moderately large aggregate: aniline nonamer. The structure of the cluster at each step of the nucleation was unravelled combining mass-resolved IR spectroscopy and computational chemistry , demonstrating that aggregation is primarily guided by formation of extensive N-H ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ N hydrogen-bond networks that give the aggregates a sort of branched backbone , in clear competition with multiple N-H/C-H ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ π and π ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ π interactions. The result is the co-existence of close nucleation paths connecting relational aggregates. The delicate balance<symptom> of molecular forces makes the aniline clusters a challenge for molecular orbital calculations and an ideal system to refine the present nucleation models. Noticeably , spectroscopic signatures characteristic of the condensed phase are apparent in the nanometer-size aggregates formed in this work.
