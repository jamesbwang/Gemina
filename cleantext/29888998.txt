  A developmental process can be described as changes through time within a complex dynamic system. The self-organized changes and emergent behaviour during development can be described and modeled as a dynamical system. We propose a dynamical system approach to answer the main question in human cognitive development i.e. the changes during development happens continuously or in discontinuous stages. Within this approach there is a concept; the size of time scales , which can be used to address the aforementioned question. We introduce a framework , by considering the concept of time-scale , in which `` fast '' and `` slow '' is defined by the size of time-scales. According to our suggested model , the overall pattern of development can be seen as one continuous function , with different time-scales in different time intervals.
