  Application of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry to microbiology and natural product research has opened the door to the exploration of microbial interactions and the consequent discovery of new natural products and their functions in the interactions. However , several drawbacks of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry have limited its application especially to complicated and uneven microbial samples. Here , we applied nanostructured silicon as a substrate for surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry for microbial imaging mass spectrometry to explore fungal metabolic interactions. We chose Phellinus noxius and Aspergillus strains to evaluate the potential of microbial imaging mass spectrometry on nanostructured silicon because both fungi<pathogen> produce a dense mass of aerial mycelia , which is known to complicate the collection of high-quality imaging mass spectrometry data. Our simple and straightforward sample imprinting method and low background interference resulted in an efficient analysis of small metabolites from the complex microbial interaction samples.
