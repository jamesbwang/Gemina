  Inulo-oligosaccharides ( IOSs) , a novel food additive and health product , represent a promising alternative to antibiotics. As prebiotics , IOSs can be obtained from inulin by endo-inulinase-mediated hydrolysis. Nonetheless , enzymatic catalysis is not feasible industrially because of the required catalytic conditions and cost. In this study , a 2331-bp optimized gene inuQ ( from Pseudomonas<pathogen> mucidolens) encoding endo-inulinase was cloned into shuttle vector PHY300PLK and transfected into Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> WB800-R , with the simultaneous deletion of gene sacC encoding levanase. The maximal IOS yield after hydrolysis of the crude extract of inulin was 67.84 Â± 0.72 g/L for a recombinant strain with the signal peptide nprB from alkaline protease and promoter P
