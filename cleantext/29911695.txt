  Chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGvHD) is a grave complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( alloHCT). Despite the use of prophylactic regimens for cGvHD , a significant proportion of patients develop cGvHD following alloHCT. The standard first-line therapy for cGvHD is high-dose corticosteroids. However , roughly 50 % of patients will exhibit steroid-refractory or steroid-dependent cGvHD , which increases the risk of non-relapse mortality. Ibrutinib was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) in August 2017 for the treatment of cGvHD after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. The approval was based on a study that demonstrated high rates of sustained responses and manageable toxicities in patients with steroid-refractory or- dependent cGvHD. In this review , we address the mechanisms of action of ibrutinib in cGvHD , as well as preclinical and clinical data supporting its use in patients with this important post-transplant complication.
