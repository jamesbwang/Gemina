  Immune cell functions are regulated by co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory receptors. The first two generations of cancer immunotherapy agents consist primarily of antagonist antibodies that block negative immune checkpoints , such as programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte<symptom> protein 4 ( CTLA4). Looking ahead , there is substantial promise in targeting co-stimulatory receptors with agonist antibodies , and a growing number of these agents are making their way through various stages of development. This Review discusses the key considerations and potential pitfalls of immune agonist antibody design and development , their differentiating features from antagonist antibodies and the landscape of agonist antibodies in clinical development for cancer treatment.
