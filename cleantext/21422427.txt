  Circulating tumor cells ( CTCs) have been suggested as potential prognostic indicators for multiple tumors , including gastric cancer; however , pre- and post-operative CTC changes in resectable gastric cancer and possible correlations to post-operative recurrence have not been evaluated. Subjects ( n = 93) with resectable gastric cancer were prospectively reviewed from July 2013 to December 2014 at Peking University Cancer Hospital. The proportion of CTCs were evaluated before ( n = 93) and after ( n = 63) radical operation using a standardized CellSearch system. CTCs ≥ 1 were measured in the pre-operative blood of 31 ( 33.3 %) patients and in the post-operative blood of 21 patients ( 33.3 %). Patients with relatively poor clinicopathological features had more pre- and post-operative CTCs. The 3-year disease-free survival ( DFS) rate for patients with CTCs ≥ 5/7 .5 ml was significantly lower than for patients with CTCs < 5/7 .5 ml ( 40.0 % vs 66.4 % , p < 0.001 for pre-surgery; 25.0 % vs 62.2 % , p < 0.001 for post-surgery). Patients with CTCs ≥ 5/7 .5 ml in post-operative blood had significantly shorter mean DFS ( 1.28 vs 31.6 months; p = 0.002) and overall survival ( OS; 10.0 vs 34.9 months; p = 0.001) than other patients. Among the 10 patients with hematogenous recurrence , 3 had post-operative CTCs ≥ 2/7 .5 ml and had early recurrence ( DFS 1.1 , 1.1 , 1.4 months). Moreover , DFS for the seven patients was 20.2 , 11.9 , 20.0 , 6.0 , 15.5 , 25.9 , 30.0 months , respectively. DFS for the three patients with increased CTCs after surgery was shorter than for patients with mildly increased , stable , or decreased CTCs. Pre- and post-operative CTCs are promising prognostic markers for resectable gastric cancer. Our study further suggests that increased post-operative CTCs may be correlated with hematogenous recurrence. Trial registration ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01848015).
