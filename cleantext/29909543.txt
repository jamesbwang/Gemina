  Organic contaminants , and herbicides in particular , represent a risk for aquatic ecosystems. The primary target of herbicides are producers , the base of food webs , but frequently they end up far from the application point affecting non-target species. Its presence can work as sub-lethal stimulus , which sort the genetic and phenotypic differences within a species. Intraspecific variation allows adaptation to changes in the environment but also to new niches due to variations in species ' sensitivity and biochemical response to a certain chemical. A better understanding of these variations can lead to the development of improved strategies for ecosystem protection. This research aimed to compare a sensitive and a tolerant strain of the freshwater diatom Nitzschia palea to atrazine. Strains were exposed to three concentrations within their tolerance range , during 96 h. The activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase , catalase , glutathione-S-transferases and glutathione peroxidases was determined. In addition , chlorophylls a and c , carotenoids , reduced glutathione , proteins and lipid peroxidation were quantified. Both strains displayed different strategies to deal with atrazine toxicity: while the sensitive strain decreased the oxidative stress , increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase , the tolerant strain invested in conjugation pathways and carotenoids ' maintenance.
