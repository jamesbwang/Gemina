  To examine trends in patients submitting samples for cell-free DNA screening to determine whether they reflect a shift towards NIPT use in the low-risk population. A review of demographic information was performed for all specimens submitted to the Ariosa Diagnostics clinical laboratory for the Harmony There was a significant increase in the proportion of specimens submitted by patients under 35 , from 47.3 % in 2014 to 60.3 % in 2017 ( Chi-square test , p < .001). The proportion of samples submitted to our laboratory by patients under 35 years has significantly increased in the 4-year subset , which represents the demographics of a diverse group of patients from across the globe. This suggests an increase in uptake of NIPT in the low-risk population.
