  Discrimination in healthcare settings is a barrier to healthcare engagement. We analyzed two nationally representative datasets to assess change in discrimination in healthcare settings reported by HIV<pathogen> patients from 1996 to 2011-2013. Perceived discrimination in healthcare settings significantly decreased over time , from 24 % in 1996 to 15 % in 2011-2013. Improvements over time in HIV<pathogen> clinicians ' engagement in prevention discussions with patients following federal agencies ' recommendations may have been a contributing factor.
