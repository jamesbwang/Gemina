  The purpose of this study is to estimate and compare neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet ( Nd: YAG) capsulotomy rates for AcrySof Clinical trials that involved the implantation of AcrySof or Clareon monofocal IOLs in subjects with cataract or presbyopia were extracted from the literature and a company repository of clinical studies. The study duration , number of eyes , and cumulative percent of Nd: YAGs for posterior capsule opacification were extracted. Bayesian random effects meta-analyses were conducted to estimate and compare outcomes for the 2 different IOL materials. A Bayesian random effects , meta-analysis was performed that combined a literature review of published AcrySof Nd: YAG posterior capsulotomy rates and Nd: YAG rates observed in Alcon-sponsored clinical studies of AcrySof and Clareon. Sixteen Alcon studies contained Nd: YAG data suitable for meta-analysis. Three of these Alcon studies contained results for the Clareon material ( 2 one-year studies , and 1 three-year study). The literature review included 50 papers from 1998 to 2015. In combination , 30,891 eyes were available for analysis and 2040 Nd: YAG procedures were reported in studies with a follow-up duration ranging in length from 4 months to 10 years. The overall probability of performing a Nd: YAG capsulotomy within a year of implant for AcrySof was 1.44 % ( 1.11 % to 1.83 %) and 0.62 % ( 0.21 % to 1.38 %) for Clareon. There was small improvement in the probability of Nd: YAG within a year of implant for Clareon lenses of about 0.82 % with a 95 % credible interval of ( 0.07 % to 1.36 %) at 1 year. Results were similar for incidence rates per 100 surgeries in a year: 0.62 ( 0.21 to 1.40) for Clareon , 1.46 ( 1.12 to 1.87) for AcrySof , and the difference was 0.84 ( 0.07 to 1.39) favoring Clareon. At 3 years , the overall probability of performing a Nd: YAG capsulotomy for AcrySof was 4.19 % ( 3.24 % to 5.30 %) compared with only 1.82 % ( 0.63 % to 4.02 %) for Clareon. A meta-analysis of Clareon multi-piece and single-piece clinical data predicts that the cumulative Clareon Nd: YAG probability will be â‰¤ AcrySof by 2.37 % ( 0.18 % to 3.91 %) at 3 years. The results indicate that Clareon is likely to perform as well as , and possibly better than , AcrySof in terms of Nd: YAG capsulotomy rates.
