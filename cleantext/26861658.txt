  In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention after acute myocardial infarction , hyperglycaemia on admission is associated with an increased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN). However , the effects of hyperglycaemia and elevated glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c) on CIN have remained to be fully elucidated. Therefore , a prospective cohort study was performed , comprising 258 patients who underwent coronary angiography between May 2017 and November 2017 at Zhongda Hospital affiliated with Southeast University ( Nanjing , China). According to the diagnostic criteria for CIN ( increase of serum creatinine by > 44.2 Âµmol/l or by 25 % within 48-72 h of using contrast agent) , the patients were divided into two groups: CIN ( 45 cases) and non-CIN ( 213 cases). For all patients , the baseline data , medical history , laboratory parameters , medication history and intraoperative situation were recorded and assessed using single-factor analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis to analyse the risk factors of CIN. The incidence of CIN in the hyperglycaemia group ( blood glucose on admission , > 11.1 mmol/l) was 25 % , compared with 13.8 % in the non-hyperglycaemia group ( P = 0.026). Furthermore , the incidence of CIN in the elevated HbA1c group ( HbA1c on admission , upper limit of normal) was 26.1 % , compared with 14.3 % in the group without elevated HbA1c ( P = 0.027). Hyperglycaemia was present on hospital admission in 84 of 258 patients ( 32.6 %). The percentage of patients with elevated HbA1c was 26.7 %. Age , estimated glomerular filtration rate , pre-operative blood cholesterol , hyperglycaemia on admission and elevated HbA1c were all identified to be associated with CIN. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis , hyperglycaemia was an independent predictor of CIN ( odds ratio , 2.815; 95 % confidence interval , 1.042-4.581; P = 0.029). In the acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) and diabetes subgroups , hyperglycaemia was significantly associated with CIN. In the ACS subgroup , the incidence of CIN was 38.1 %. It was indicated that hyperglycaemia is an independent risk factor for CIN , particularly in patients with ACS or diabetes. Trial registration no. ChiCTR-OOC-17011466.
