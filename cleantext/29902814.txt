  The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of Denaverine hydrochloride ( DNH) in heifers on calf vitality. A total of 83 calvings with 38 female and 45 male calves were included in the study. Thirty minutes after onset of stage 2 of calving , 400 mg DNH or placebo ( 0.9 % NaCl) were administered subcutaneously. If the calving procedure was not completed after 60 minutes , an extraction was conducted and pulling force was measured by using a digital force gauge. Directly after parturition , vitality of calves was evaluated using a modified APGAR score. Additionally , lactate concentration in blood from Vena auricularis<pathogen> was measured with a handheld measuring device ( lactate scout). No effect of treatment was observed on APGAR score and lactate concentration. Denaverine hydrochloride is a regularly used substance in obstetrics in veterinary medicine in many European countries. We could not confirm our hypotheses that treating heifers with DNH has a positive effect on calf vitality evaluated by APGAR score and lactate concentration in blood.
