  Seven undescribed phloroglucinol derivatives , tomentodiones N-T , and eleven known ones were isolated from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa. Tomentodione N is the first example of a Î²-triketone unit coupled with an isoamyl alcohol through a furan fused-ring , and tomentodiones N , S , T were three racemates. The undescribed structures were elucidated by means of spectroscopic , X-ray diffraction , electronic circular dichroism calculation , and chemical methods. In addition , the isolated compounds were determined for the cytotoxic activities on HeLa cells and anti-inflammatory activities in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.
