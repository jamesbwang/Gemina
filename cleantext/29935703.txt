  Critical care transport ( CCT) supports regionalization of medical care. Focus on the quality of CCT care prompted the development of the Ground and Air Medical qUality in Transport ( GAMUT) Quality Improvement collaborative database which tracks consensus quality metrics. The Institute of Medicine recommends benchmarking of comparative data to accelerate improvement. Herein , we report the strategies and rationale for GAMUT QI Collaborative benchmarking. The GAMUT database includes > 350 programs internationally with > 200,000 annual patient contacts. Evidence-based literature review performed in May 2016 and October 2017 identified benchmarking strategies were evaluated and summarized , specific to the GAMUT metrics. Statistical analyses include simple statistics and weighted expectation calculations for benchmark examples ( Pearson chi-square with Bonferroni adjusted post-hoc z tests). Evidence-based literature search yielded 70 articles , and 31 were selected for inclusion in our evidence table. 5 evidence-based benchmark strategies were considered: average ( mean) , average ( median) , adjusted benchmark ( based on expected outcome) , Achievable Benchmark of Care ( ABC) , and Delphi. ABC threshold establishes a higher target ( 90th percentile) forcing more programs to achieve higher performance. Benchmarking is not well-suited for a single strategy and requires customized consideration based on each metric , though adjusted benchmark and ABC generally set higher performance benchmarks.
