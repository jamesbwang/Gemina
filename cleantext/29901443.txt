  We sought to compare vascular healing with bioresorbable everolimus-eluting vascular scaffolds ( BVS) and drug-eluting stents with bioabsorbable polymers ( BP-DES) at 6 and 12 months implanted both in same patients. Multicenter and prospective study including patients with at least two comparable lesions<symptom> to treat. In every patient both BVS and BP-DES ( Synergy ™ , Orsiro ™ or Biomatrix Flex ™) were implanted by lesion<symptom> randomization. Patients included were evaluated with optical coherence tomography at 6 or 12 months ( 2:1). Finally , 68 patients had examination at 6 months and 27 patients at 12 months. Uncovered struts rates at 6 months were 1.7 ± 3.2 % for BVS and 5.3 ± 5.6 % for BP-DES ( p = 0.0001) and at 12 months 0.48 ± 0.72 % and 4.8 ± 5 % respectively ( p = 0.001). Rates of strut malapposition were significantly lower with BVS. There was no significant intra-patient correlation BP-DES/ BVS for endpoints. Evaginations were more frequent and larger with BVS. Discontinuities in BVS were observed in 19.4 % at 6 months and 14.3 % at 12 months. Vascular healing with BVS and BP-DES could be more device-specific than patient-specific. At follow-up , BVS presented less uncovered or non-apposed struts than BP-DES but more frequent and larger evaginations. Discontinuities in BVS were relatively frequent at both time points.
