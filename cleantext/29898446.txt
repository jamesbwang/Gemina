  There are no reliable biomarkers that could evaluate the disease burden in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS). The aim of our study is to evaluate the changes in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) and serum neurofilament subunit L ( NF-L) in patients with ALS and to analyze the correlations between the levels of NF-L and clinical parameters. CSF and serum samples were obtained from 80 ALS patients and 40 controls. The levels of NF-L in CSF and serum were assessed , and disease progression parameters including duration , revised ALS Functional Rating Scale ( ALSFRS-r) score , disease progression rate ( DPR) , upper motor neuron ( UMN) score , and survival were analyzed by registered neurologists. All samples were measured using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism software. Compared to the controls , the ALS patients displayed significantly increased levels of NF-L; these values were negatively correlated with the ALSFRS-r score and positively correlated with the decrease in ALSFRS-r score , DPR , and UMN score. There was no correlation between levels of NF-L and duration. In addition , the cumulative survival rate in ALS patients with a low level of NF-L was higher than in patients with a high level of NF-L. NF-L levels increased in CSF and serum of patients with ALS. NF-L may thus be a neurodegenerative biomarker for predicting ALS severity and progression , and the survival of patients with this disease.
