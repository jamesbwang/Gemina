  Large bone defects remain a tremendous clinical challenge. There is growing evidence in support of treatment strategies that direct defect repair through an endochondral route , involving a cartilage intermediate. While culture-expanded stem/progenitor cells are being evaluated for this purpose , these cells would compete with endogenous repair cells for limited oxygen and nutrients within ischaemic defects. Alternatively , it may be possible to employ extracellular vesicles ( EVs) secreted by culture-expanded cells for overcoming key bottlenecks to endochondral repair , such as defect vascularization , chondrogenesis , and osseous remodelling. While mesenchymal stromal/stem cells are a promising source of therapeutic EVs , other donor cells should also be considered. The efficacy of an EV-based therapeutic will likely depend on the design of companion scaffolds for controlled delivery to specific target cells. Ultimately , the knowledge gained from studies of EVs could one day inform the long-term development of synthetic , engineered nanovesicles. In the meantime , EVs harnessed from
