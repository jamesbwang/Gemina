  Eribulin has significantly improved overall survival for patients with metastatic breast cancer who received â‰¥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced disease. This trial assessed eribulin as adjuvant therapy for patients with early-stage breast cancer. Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative , stage I to III breast cancer received doxorubicin 60 mg/m Eighty-one patients ( cohort 1 , n = 55; cohort 2 , n = 26) entered the treatment phase; 88 % completed treatment. Feasibility was 72.9 % ( 90 % confidence interval , 60.4 , 83.2) in cohort 1 and 60.0 % ( 90 % confidence interval , 41.7 , 76.4) in cohort 2. The most frequent eribulin-related adverse events ( all grades) were fatigue<symptom> ( 75.9 %) , peripheral neuropathy ( 54.4 %) , nausea<symptom> ( 39.2 %) , neutropenia ( 35.4 % ( 31.5 % of patients in cohort 1; 44.0 % in cohort 2)) , and arthralgia ( 26.6 %). The primary end point of > 80 % feasibility was not met. No unexpected adverse events were observed , and 62 % of patients received full dosing with no dose delay or reduction. Further investigation of this regimen with alternative dosing schedules or use of growth factors could be considered.
