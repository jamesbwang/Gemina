  The purpose of the study was to assess by simultaneous positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging ( PET/MRI) the response to chemotherapy ( CHT) and/or radiotherapy ( RT) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC). Five patients with HNSCC underwent simultaneous PET/MRI examination before and after CHT and/or RT.. Standard uptake volume ( SUV) , apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) , Ktrans , Kep , Ve , and iAUC pre- and post-treatment values were extracted and compared. The response to treatment was assessed according to RECIST criteria and classified as complete response ( CR) , partial response ( PR) , stable disease ( SD) , and progression disease ( PD). In patient 1 , PR was observed with increased ADC , Ktrans , and Ve values and reduction of SUV , iAUC , and Kep values; during clinical and instrumental follow-up , the patient experienced disease progression. Patient 2 , classified as PR , showed increased ADC values and reduction of SUV and all perfusion parameters; follow-up demonstrated disease stability. Patient 3 , considered as SD , showed increase of ADC and all perfusion values with a mild decrease of SUV; PD was observed during clinical and instrumental follow-up. Patients 4 and 5 showed a CR with no detectable tumor lesions<symptom> at post-treatment PET/MRI examination , confirmed by 1-year follow-up. Multiparametric evaluation with simultaneous PET/MRI could be a useful tool to assess and predict the response to CHT and/or RT in patients with HNSCC.
