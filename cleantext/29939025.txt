  Appropriate concentrations and proportion of acetate esters and higher alcohols improve the quality of Chinese Baijiu. To regulate the concentrations of acetate esters in Chinese Baijiu , we constructed a PGK1 promoter library through error-prone PCR. Then , we used an enhanced green fluorescent protein as a reporter to characterize the activities of PGK1p mutants. The PGK1p library contained 28 PGK1p mutants and spanned an activity that ranged between 0.1 % and 141 % of wild-type PGK1p. Seven PGK1p mutants were characterized by an additional reporter Î²-galactosidase and then used for the overexpression of ATF1 with BAT2 deletion in Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> a45. The production of ethyl acetate in strains A8 , A17 , A18 , A27 , A22 , A25 , A28 , and AWT were 1.66- , 3.09- , 10.59- , 13.07- , 15.99- , 22.67- , 24.06- , and 27.22-fold higher than that of the parental strain. The results on alcohol acetyltransferase ( AATase) activity showed that the PGK1p library precisely controlled ATF1 expression and regulated the acetate esters production.
