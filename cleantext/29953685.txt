  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( IIH) is positively associated with obesity , mostly in young women. The global increase in obesity may influence the burden of IIH. Using PubMed , Embase , Medline and Web of Science databases a meta-analysis and systematic review of epidemiological studies of IIH were performed up to June 2017. Temporal changes in IIH incidence were measured and incidence rates of IIH were correlated with country-specific World Health Organisation obesity rates. Prevalence data and shunting rates of IIH were recorded. The quality of epidemiological studies was assessed using the STandards of Reporting Of Neurological Disorders ( STROND) criteria. In 15 identified studies there were 889 patients ( 87 % women) , mean age 29.8 years. The incidence of IIH ranged from 0.03 to 2.36 per 100,000 per year. Pooled incidence of IIH was 1.20 per 100,000/ year although there was very high heterogeneity ( I IIH is a public health concern as increased obesity prevalence is associated with increased incidence of IIH. Better quality of epidemiological studies is required to improve understanding of IIH and inform health policy for IIH management. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
