  In the reaction of ( RuHClP3) ( P = PPh3) with NaOMe in methanol , the product is ( RuH2 ( CO) P3). Short reaction times show that the final product is formed through ( RuH4P3) as the major intermediate. Using NaOCD3 in CD3OD , the first formed product is ( RuH4P ' 3) ( P ' is PPh3 partially deuterated in the ortho positions of the aromatic rings). Further reaction leads to a mixture of ( RuHnD2-n ( CO) P3) ( n = 0 , 22 %; n = 1 , 2 isomers each 28 %; n = 2 , 22 %). Mechanistic aspects of both steps of the reaction are explored and , together with previously published calculations , they provide definitive mechanisms for both dehydrogenation and decarbonylation in these interesting systems.
