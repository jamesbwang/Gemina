  The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of myofascial trigger points ( MTrPs) in patients with articular disc displacement with reduction ( DDWR) and to identify which clinical variables are associated with the concomitant presence of DDWR and MTrPs. 130 patients were selected that sought treatment due to joint<symptom> pain<symptom> , with ages â‰¥ 18 years , of both genders , with DDWR confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. The sample was divided into two groups: Group 1 , patients with DDWR and MTrPs ( N = 101); and Group 2 , patients with DDWR and no MTrPs ( N = 29). Information on gender , age , pain duration , pain scores , and maximal interincisal distance ( MID) were collected. The logistic regression model was used and the odds ratios ( OR) was calculated ( p < 0.05). Group 1 presented statistically significant higher mean pain scores ( p = 0.007) , and smaller MID ( p = 0.0268) than Group 2. OR were significant for the pain scores ( 1.429) , MID ( 0.937) and gender ( women) ( 2.810). Patients with DDWR and MTrPs had increased pain scores and a MID decrease compared to patients with DDWR and no MTrPs. The variables pain scores , MID , and gender ( women) showed a significant association with the concomitant presence of DDWR and MTrPs.
