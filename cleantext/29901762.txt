  A polymerase ribozyme can be used to label the 3 ' end of RNA or DNA molecules by incorporating a variety of functionalized nucleotide analogs. Guided by a complementary template , the ribozyme adds a single nucleotide that may contain a fluorophore , biotin , azide or alkyne moiety , thus enabling the detection and/or capture of selectively labeled materials. Employing a variety of commercially available nucleotide analogs , efficient labeling was demonstrated for model RNAs and DNAs , human microRNAs and natural tRNA.
