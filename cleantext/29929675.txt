  This study sought to examine the relationship between the number of oral antiarrhythmic drug ( AAD) failures before referral for ventricular tachycardia<symptom> ( VT) ablation and subsequent clinical outcomes. Failure of AADs prompts referral for VT ablation. Consecutive patients ( n = 669) with sustained VT who were referred for a first-time ablation were divided into 2 groups according to the number of oral Class 1 or 3 AAD failures before referral: single-drug failure ( ≤ 1 AAD; n = 256) or multidrug failure ( > 1 AADs; n = 413). Outcomes were stratified according to underlying disease type ( no structural heart disease ( SHD) ( n = 87); ischemic cardiomyopathy ( ICM) ( n = 368); and ischemic cardiomyopathy ( NICM) ( n = 214)) and reported at a mean follow-up of 35 ± 46 months. Patients with multidrug failure , compared with patients with single-drug failure , had more advanced SHD and required more extensive ablation to control arrhythmia. Multidrug failure , compared with single-drug failure , was associated with lower ventricular arrhythmia-free survival in ICM ( 46 ± 4 % vs. 58 ± 6 %; p = 0.03) and NICM ( 26 ± 5 % vs. 49 ± 6 %; p = 0.008) , but not in the absence of SHD ( 71 ± 8 % vs. 85 ± 7 %; p = 0.10). Overall survival was lower in multidrug failure versus single-drug failure groups in patients with ICM ( 71 ± 3 % vs. 84 ± 4 %; p = 0.03) and NICM ( 70 ± 5 % vs. 88 ± 4 %; p < 0.001). Multidrug failure was independently associated with a higher risk of ventricular arrhythmia recurrence ( hazard ratio: 1.6; p = 0.01) and mortality in NICM ( hazard ratio: 2.6; p = 0.008) , but not in ICM. Patients with SHD and failure of multiple oral AADs before VT ablation referral have more advanced heart disease and worse clinical outcomes following ablation , especially in NICM.
