  Radiotherapy ( RT) used at immunogenic doses leads to accumulation of cytosolic double-stranded DNA ( dsDNA) in cancer cells , which activates type I IFN ( IFN-I) via the cGAS/STING pathway. Cancer cell-derived IFN-I is required to recruit BATF3-dependent dendritic cells ( DC) to poorly immunogenic tumors and trigger antitumor T-cell responses in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. We have previously demonstrated that the exonuclease TREX1 regulates radiation immunogenicity by degrading cytosolic dsDNA. Tumor-derived DNA can also activate cGAS/STING-mediated production of IFN-I by DCs infiltrating immunogenic tumors. However , how DNA from cancer cells is transferred to the cytoplasm of DCs remains unclear. Here , we showed that tumor-derived exosomes ( TEX) produced by irradiated mouse breast cancer cells ( RT-TEX) transfer dsDNA to DCs and stimulate DC upregulation of costimulatory molecules and STING-dependent activation of IFN-I.
