  We compared the effectiveness of an intensive smoking cessation intervention among smokers with and without a severe mental disorder ( SMD) and identified factors associated with successful quitting. The main hypothesis was that smokers with an SMD would be less likely to stay continuously smoke-free for 6 months. A prospective cohort study. In all , 302 smoking cessation clinics in Denmark from municipal clinics , pharmacies , hospitals , midwives , primary care facilities and other private providers who reported data to the national Danish Smoking Cessation Database from 2006 to 2016 participated in this study. A total of 38293 patients from the Danish Smoking Cessation Database. Patients with an SMD were identified by linking data to the Danish National Patient Register. Diagnoses of organic mental disorders ( F0 chapter) or intellectual disabilities ( F7 chapter) were not included. Smokers ≥ 18 years old who were attending a Gold Standard Programme ( GSP) with planned follow-up were included. Smokers not wanting contact after 6 months were excluded. A comprehensive manual-based smoking cessation intervention comprising five meetings over a 6-week period ( the GSP). Self-reported continuous abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. In all , 69 % of the participants participated in the follow-up after 6 months. The overall rate of successful quitting was high but significantly lower in SMD smokers ( 29 % vs 38 %; OR 0.74; 95 % CI 0.68 to 0.80). Variables associated with successful quitting were compliance ( defined as attending ≥ 75 % of the planned meetings) , older age and male gender as well as not being disadvantaged , heavy smoking or recommendation of intervention by health professionals. Only 29 % of smokers with an SMD successfully quit smoking which was significantly lower than the 38 % of smokers without an SMD. Compliance was the most important predictor for successful quitting.
