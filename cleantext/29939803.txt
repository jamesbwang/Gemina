  This study sought to assess the perceptions of health care practitioners ( HCPs) regarding heavy menstrual bleeding ( HMB). We developed an online survey for HCPs administered in 10 countries ( Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , Korea , Russia , Spain , UK and USA) , in order to assess their perceptions regarding HMB. We received 1032 responses. Most HCPs considered more than 7 days of bleeding abnormal. There was a significant difference in the definition of HMB between countries ( p < .001). Most HCPs measured menstrual blood<symptom> loss<symptom> by the number of sanitary pads or tampons needed , followed by the impact on patients ' daily activities. The majority of HMB patients ( 61 %) were diagnosed as having a non-structural disorder with no causative identifiable coagulopathy. Patient acceptance and compliance were each relevant for the treatment decisions of half of the HCPs. Treatment options for idiopathic HMB featured mainly oral contraceptives and the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. Surgery was mentioned as a treatment option for idiopathic HMB by 44 % of HCPs. The definition of HMB and HCP perceptions of HMB regarding diagnostic and therapeutic issues varied between countries. Surgery was mentioned as a treatment for idiopathic HMB by nearly half of HCPs. Clinician education is greatly needed to improve the management of women with HMB.
