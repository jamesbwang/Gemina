  Fcγ receptor I ( FcγRI/CD64) that is restrictedly expressed on monocytes and macrophages , acts as the single high-affinity receptor of immunoglobulin G ( IgG) in human. The expression of FcγRI is positively correlated with immune inflammation<symptom>. The primary aim of this study was to explore the effects of FcγRI expression on immune-related inflammatory response and investigate the potential mechanisms. FcγRI-expressing Ba/F3 cells are the ideal models for evaluating the functions of FcγRI. Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB) and NOD-like receptor protein 3 ( NLRP3) inflammasome-associated protein expressions and inflammatory cytokine ( IL-1β and IL-18) release were detected in the presence or absence of NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC). Besides , the effects of FcγRI on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasomes were also investigated in THP-1 macrophages deficient for FcγRI. FcγRI-expressing Ba/F3 cells appeared increased NLRP3 inflammasome formation and IL-1β and IL-18 release via activating NF-κB signaling. Interestingly , this alteration could be reversed in THP-1 macrophages after FcγRI was silenced. These results indicated that FcγRI functioned as a regulator for immune inflammation<symptom> via acceleration of NF-κB regulating NLRP3 inflammasome signaling.
