  To determine the prevalence of community and street-scale design features that promote walking across the US Virgin Islands ( USVI). In May 2016 , the USVI Department of Health , with technical assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , conducted a territory-wide audit with a validated tool. We selected street segments ( n = 1114) via a 2-stage sampling method , and estimates were weighted to be representative of publicly accessible street length. Overall , 10.7 % of the street length contained a transit stop , 11.3 % had sidewalks , 21.7 % had at least 1 destination ( e.g. , stores , restaurants) , 27.4 % had a traffic calming feature ( e.g. , speed humps) , and 53.2 % had at least some street lighting. Several features were less prevalent on residential streets compared with commercial streets , including transit stops , sidewalks , destinations , and street lighting ( P < .01). Across the USVI , community and street-scale features supportive of walking were uncommon. Improving community and street-scale design in the USVI , particularly in residential areas , could increase physical activity by enhancing walkability and therefore improve public health. These data can be used to inform community planning in the USVI.
