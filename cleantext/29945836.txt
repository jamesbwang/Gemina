  Acute aortic occlusion ( AAO) is a life-threatening event necessitating prompt revascularization to the pelvis and lower extremities. Because of its uncommon nature , outcomes after revascularization for AAO are not well characterized. Our aim was to describe the perioperative morbidity and mortality associated with revascularization and to identify the patients at highest risk. A retrospective chart review was performed of patients who presented to our institution from 2006 to 2017 with acute distal aortic occlusion. Patients with a prior aortofemoral bypass were excluded , but those with aortoiliac stents were included. Baseline demographics and comorbidities , preoperative clinical presentation and imaging , procedural details , and postoperative hospital course were reviewed. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality , and major complications were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Logistic regression models were constructed to identify factors associated with 30-day mortality. We identified 65 patients who underwent revascularization for AAO. Median age was 63 years ( range , 35-89 years) , and 64.6 % were male; 56.4 % of patients presented within 24 hours of symptom onset , and 43.8 % were treated within 6 hours of presentation. There were particularly high rates of prior coronary artery disease ( 62.3 %) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( 41.0 %); 18.5 % had prior iliac stents. Preoperative imaging in 44 patients showed occlusion of the inferior mesenteric artery in 36.0 % and both internal iliac arteries in 34.7 %. Treatments for revascularization included axillobifemoral bypass ( 55.4 %) , aortoiliac thromboembolectomy ( 15.4 %) , aortobifemoral bypass ( 13.9 %) , and aortoiliac stenting ( 15.4 %). Overall 30-day mortality was 27.7 % and was not affected by treatment modality. Mortality was highest in patients older than 60 years ( 40.5 % vs 10.7 %; P = .01) and those presenting with lactate elevation ( 45.5 % vs 5.9 %; P = .004) or motor deficit in at least one extremity ( 36.6 % vs 9.5 %; P = .03). Univariate predictors of 30-day mortality were age â‰¥ 60 years ( odds ratio ( OR) , 5.68; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.45-22.26; P = .01) , presentation with motor deficit ( OR , 5.48; 95 % CI , 1.12-26.86; P = .04) , presentation with elevated lactate level ( OR , 13.33; 95 % CI , 1.58-11.57; P = .02) , history of prior stroke ( OR , 4.80; 95 % CI , 1.21-18.97; P = .03) , and bilateral internal iliac artery occlusion ( OR , 7.11; 95 % CI , 1.54-32.91; P = .01). At least one postoperative complication was observed in 78.5 % of patients , including acute kidney injury ( 56.9 % , with 21.5 % requiring hemodialysis) , respiratory complications ( 46.2 %) , cardiovascular complications ( 33.9 %) , major amputation ( 15.4 % , bilateral in 7.7 %) , and bowel ischemia ( 10.8 %). Even with prompt revascularization and despite the chosen treatment modality , AAO carries high risk of mortality and numerous life-threatening complications. Older patients presenting with elevated lactate levels , motor deficit , and bilateral internal iliac artery occlusions are at the highest risk of perioperative mortality. These factors may aid in risk stratification and managing expectations in this critically ill population.
