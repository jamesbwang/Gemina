  The origins and evolution of the Archaea , Bacteria , and Eukarya remain controversial. Phylogenomic-wide studies of molecular features that are evolutionarily conserved , such as protein structural domains , suggest Archaea is the first domain of life to diversify from a stem line of descent. This line embodies the last universal common ancestor of cellular life. Here , we propose that ancestors of Euryarchaeota co-evolved with those of Bacteria prior to the diversification of Eukarya. This co-evolutionary scenario is supported by comparative genomic and phylogenomic analyses of the distributions of fold families of domains in the proteomes of free-living organisms , which show horizontal gene recruitments and informational process homologies. It also benefits from the molecular study of cell physiologies responsible for membrane phospholipids , methanogenesis , methane oxidation , cell division , gas vesicles , and the cell wall. Our theory however challenges popular cell fusion and two-domain of life scenarios derived from sequence analysis , demanding phylogenetic reconciliation.
