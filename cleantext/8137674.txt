  Full laparoscopic left colectomy with transrectal specimen extraction is proposed as an improvement of the minimally invasive surgical technique. This paper reviews in detail the current status of left-sided colectomy and upper rectum resection with transrectal specimen extraction. A systematic review was performed of all types of publications on colorectal resection with natural orifice specimen extraction ( NOSE). We only included studies reporting on left colectomy , sigmoidectomy , and high anterior resection with transrectal specimen extraction ( TRSE) , excluding transanal ( TASE) , transvaginal , or transcolonic specimen extraction. Surgical techniques , patient characteristics , and outcomes were reviewed in detail. Thirty-five papers reported on TRSE ( 2 randomized clinical trials , 7 case-matched series , 19 case series , 5 case reports , and 2 articles on surgical technique). We found a wide variety of innovative anastomotic and specimen extraction techniques. After excluding duplicates and papers reporting mixed TRSE and TASE results , outcomes in patients undergoing TRSE from 23 publications showed a conversion rate to conventional laparoscopy of 3.7 % ( 21/559) , overall morbidity 9.5 % ( 53/559) ( major in 2.9 % ( 16/559) , intra-abdominal infection in 2.1 % ( 12/559)). No mortality was reported. Postoperative anal incontinence was rarely reported. Several studies showed a decrease in postoperative pain and some in length of hospital stay. Colectomy with TRSE is feasible and seems safe in selected patients. Reported outcomes seem in general similar to conventional laparoscopic colectomy with a possible benefit in postoperative pain and length of hospital stay. Obvious selection bias and lack of high quality trials do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn.
