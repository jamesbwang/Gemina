  A ligand-binding assay ( LBA) was used to measure exposure of PRM-151 , the recombinant form of human pentraxin-2 ( PTX-2) , a complex pentamer with multiple binding partners. However , the assay showed a lack of dose-dependent exposure in select preclinical species and it could not differentiate the infused PRM-151 from the endogenous PTX-2 in nonhuman primates. Instead of assessing interference from its multiple binding partners , which could be time consuming and laborious , a LC-MS assay avoid of these interference was implemented to measure ` total ' drug without the use of immunoaffinity capture reagents. The resultant LC-MS data confirmed the original data and the lack of dose-dependent exposure is now understood to be due to the multiple and diverse targets and functions and resultant complex biodistribution rather than an assay artifact.
