  The extent of social isolation amongst older people has emerged as a major concern for health and social policy. Although the social and health outcomes of social isolation are well documented , evidence regarding the prevention of isolation in later life remains scarce. This article addresses this by presenting the findings from a literature review focusing on the identification , assessment , prevention , and intervention strategies relevant to social isolation in older age. The paper first addresses the issues of identification and assessment , using an ecological framework to identify the risk factors for social isolation at four levels: individual , relationship , community , and societal. It then reviews different types of interventions to reduce or prevent social isolation in later life , including one-to-one , group , service provision , technology-based , neighbourhood , and structural interventions. The paper discusses both the opportunities and the constraints associated with these different approaches. The discussion highlights future directions for research , emphasising the need for a cultural change from ` cure ' to ` prevention ' of social isolation across the life-course , and the importance of acknowledging greater diversity within the ageing population.
