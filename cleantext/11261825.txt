  Most of the current methods for programmable RNA drug therapies are unsuitable for the clinic due to low uptake efficiency and high cytotoxicity. Extracellular vesicles ( EVs) could solve these problems because they represent a natural mode of intercellular communication. However , current cellular sources for EV production are limited in availability and safety in terms of horizontal gene transfer. One potentially ideal source could be human red blood cells ( RBCs). Group O-RBCs can be used as universal donors for large-scale EV production since they are readily available in blood banks and they are devoid of DNA. Here , we describe and validate a new strategy to generate large-scale amounts of RBC-derived EVs for the delivery of RNA drugs , including antisense oligonucleotides , Cas9 mRNA , and guide RNAs. RNA drug delivery with RBCEVs shows highly robust microRNA inhibition and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in both human cells and xenograft mouse models , with no observable cytotoxicity.
