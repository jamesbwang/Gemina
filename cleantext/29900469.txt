  Construction of solid solution semiconductors has attracted much attention in photocatalysis by virtue of their tunable elemental composition and band structure. The integration of semiconductor sensitizers with molecular catalysts provides a promising way to fabricate highly efficient , selective and stable systems for CO2 photoreduction. Here ZnxCd1-xS ( ZCS) solid solutions with a well-defined floccule-like morphology composed of nanoribbons are synthesized and used as the photosensitizer to couple with tetra ( 4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin iron ( iii) chloride ( FeTCPP) for CO2 reduction. The effects of changes in surface atoms of the ZCS solid solution on the performance of CO2 photoreduction are investigated. Regardless of the presence of FeTCPP , our results show that the introduction of Zn into CdS can affect the activity and selectivity of CO2 photoreduction , as well as the stability of the obtained photocatalysts. More importantly , the presence of Zn can build efficient electron transfer channels from ZCS to FeTCPP and , thus , greatly facilitate the interfacial charge transfer. Benefitting from the efficient charge separation and electron transfer , ZCS-1/ FeTCPP ( Zn0 .14 Cd0 .84 S/FeTCPP) exhibits the highest activity for CO2 reduction under visible-light irradiation , with a CO yield of 1.28 Î¼mol and a selectivity up to 93 % after 4 h.
