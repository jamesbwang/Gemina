  Current literature on clinical controversies surrounding the use of thrombolytic agents in patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism ( PE) is reviewed. PE is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. When used in conjunction with anticoagulation , thrombolysis has been shown to reduce hemodynamic decompensation in select patients , but thrombolytic therapy is associated with high risks of bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> and its role in treating patients with intermediate-risk PE remains controversial. In the PEITHO study , the largest trial to date involving only patients with intermediate-risk PE ( The use of thrombolysis in the treatment of intermediate-risk PE is complicated by high rates of bleeding and should be limited to patients who clinically deteriorate rather than given as a standard-of-care treatment in this population. Data for low-dose thrombolysis remain limited.
