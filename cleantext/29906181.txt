  In a magnetically confined plasma with a stochastic magnetic field , the dependence of the perpendicular viscosity on the magnetic fluctuation amplitude is measured for the first time. With a controlled , ∼ tenfold variation in the fluctuation amplitude , the viscosity increases ∼ 100-fold , exhibiting the same fluctuation-amplitude-squared dependence as the predicted rate of stochastic field line diffusion. The absolute value of the viscosity is well predicted by a model based on momentum transport in a stochastic field , the first in-depth test of this model.
