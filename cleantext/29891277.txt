  P-selectin is a promising therapeutic target for acute inflammation-related diseases , and interest has been growing in the search for high-affinity glycoconjugate ligands that can target the initial P-selectin-mediated recruitment of neutrophils to the site of inflammation<symptom>. In our previous study , we isolated a water-soluble polysaccharide ( BCPS) from Bupleurum chinense and showed that it exhibits anti-inflammatory effect by antagonizing P-selectin-mediated adhesion of HL-60 cells to CHO-P cells. In this study , we prepared a P-selectin-based affinity chromatography medium and used it to purify the P-selectin-binding moiety of BCPS. The purified P-selectin-binding moiety of BCPS , designated as BCPS-m , was mainly composed of arabinose , galactose and glucose , and had a relative molecular weight of 3600 Da. The backbone of BCPS-m was composed of 1,5-linked arabinose , 1,4-linked and 1,4,6-linked glucose , and with branched 1-linked glucose or galactose terminal BCPS-m could disrupt the P-selectin-mediated binding of HL-60 cells to CHO-P cells ( CHO cells that stably expressed an exogenous P-selectin). It also blocked the interaction between P-selectin and its physiological ligand PSGL-1 significantly , resulting in much greater reduction ( 77 %) in P-selectin-PSGL-1 binding than that caused by BCPS ( 35 %). The data suggested that BCPS-m could be the key P-selectin-binding moiety of BCPS , and that it may be a better P-selectin antagonist than BCPS.
