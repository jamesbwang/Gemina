  Despite the acknowledgment that the services of diabetes educator and dietician affect outcome , the level of utilization of these services in the Saudi Arabian public health-care system is not known. The aims of the study were to establish the percentage of patients with diabetes mellitus ( DM) followed up by a diabetic educator and a dietician in a tertiary center in Saudi Arabia and associations between follow-up by a diabetic educator and a dietician and glycemic control. This was a cross-sectional study of 490 diabetic patients who attended the diabetic outpatient clinic consecutively at a public health-care institution in Riyadh. Patients answered interview questions on clinicodemographic variables and diabetic educator or dietitian follow-up during their care. Hemoglobin A1C ( HbA1C ( % , mmol/mol)) and fasting blood glucose ( mg/dL , mmol/L) levels were recorded. The majority of patients were male ( 68.8 %) , Saudi ( 71 %) , married ( 91.6 %) , high school or college educated ( 55.5 %) , had type 2 DM ( 85.5 %) , and were taking oral hypoglycemics ( 57.3 %). 69.0 % and 19.8 % of the patients had had at least some follow-up with a diabetic educator and dietician , respectively. HbA1C levels were significantly lower in patients who had had a follow-up with a dietitian ( 9.1 ± 4.5 % ( 76 ± 26 mmol/mol) vs. 7.8 ± 2.2 % ( 62 ± 13 mmol/mol); unadjusted odds ratio ( OR): 0.80 , 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs): 0.71-0.89 , P < 0.0001) , including in multivariable analysis ( adjusted OR: 0.84 , 95 % CIs: 0.72-0.99 , P = 0.04). Follow-up with a diabetic educator was not associated with glycemic control. Follow-up with a diabetic dietitian had the greatest impact on glycemic control in type 1 and type 2 DM patients. A review of the national standards of best practice of diabetes education and nutrition in Saudi Arabia is required to optimize the outcomes.
