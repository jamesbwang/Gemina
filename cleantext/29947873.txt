  Early renal dysfunction is associated with a 38 % increased fracture risk in individuals aged 65 years and older. In men but not women , early renal dysfunction is associated with decreased femoral neck bone mineral density ( BMD) which can be partially explained by increased parathyroid hormone ( PTH) concentrations. It is uncertain whether early renal dysfunction is associated with osteoporosis and increased fracture risk. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of decreased renal function with BMD and fracture risk and the role of PTH therein. We analyzed data of participants aged 65 years and older from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. A 6-year fracture follow-up was obtained in 1477 participants. BMD was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( n = 535) and vertebral fractures by lateral spinal radiograph ( n = 527) in a subsample at baseline. Glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) was estimated according to the modification of diet in renal disease equation and assessed by the five stages of chronic kidney disease ( CKD). In men and women , eGFR < 57 ml/min/1 .73 m In men and women , early decreased renal function ( eGFR < 60 ml/min/1 .73 m
