  Current methods of lymph node ( LN) staging are controversial in predicting the survival of SBA. We aimed to develop an alternative LN-classification-based nomogram to individualize SBA prognosis. Based on the data from the Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results ( SEER) database of patients diagnosed with SBA between 2004 and 2014 , we identified the cut-off points for the number of LNs examined and the number found to be metastatic using the K-adaptive partitioning ( KAPS) algorithm. Using metastatic LNs , a nomogram predicting the survival of SBA was derived , internally and externally validated , and measured by calibration curve , C-index , and decision curve analysis ( DCA) , and compared to the 8th TNM stage. A total of 1516 patients were included. The cut-off of 17 was the optimal examined LN number. For metastatic LN numbers , the cut-off points were 0 , 2 , and 8. The C-index for the nomogram was higher than the 8th TNM staging ( internal: 0.734; 95 % CI , 0.693 to 0.775 vs. 0.677; 95 % CI , 0.652 to 0.702 , P < 0.001; external: 0.715; 95 % CI , 0.674 to 0.756 vs. 0.648; 95 % CI , 0.602 to 0.693 , P < 0.001). Also , the nomogram showed good calibration in internal and external validation and larger net benefit than TNM staging. We modified current N staging into a 4-level staging system based on the number of metastatic LNs: N0 , no LN metastasis; N1 , 1-2 metastatic LNs; N2 , 3-8 metastatic LNs , and N3 , > 8 metastatic LNs and set the least examined LN number to 17. A nomogram based on this staging showed great clinical usability than TNM staging for predicting the survival of SBA patients.
