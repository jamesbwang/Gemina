  Long-term functional outcomes in young adults with facial burns remain poorly studied. This 5-year ( 2003-2008) prospective multicenter study includes burn survivors ( age 19-30 years) who completed the Young Adult<disease> Burn Outcome Questionnaire ( YABOQ) from 0 to 36 months after baseline survey administration. A composite canonical score was developed from 15 YABOQ domains using discriminant analysis , maximizing the difference at the baseline between burn-injured patients with face involved and not involved. A generalized linear model with the generalized estimation equation technique was used to track the changing pattern of the composite score over time. Individual domain scores with high correlation to the canonical score were used to evaluate recovery patterns in facial burns. A total of 153 burned ( 31 % with face burns) and 112 nonburned subjects completed 620 questionnaires. Canonical analysis showed that early postburn , facial burns were associated with a difference in outcome , but this overall difference diminished over time. Regression analysis showed that for survivors with facial injury , Emotion and Sexual Function scores were persistently lower ( worse) , while Religion scores were persistently higher. Satisfaction with Role was initially better than the nonface burned group , but over time got worse , while Perceived Appearance was initially worse in the face burned group but this difference diminished over time. Social Function Limited by Appearance was initially similar between the groups , but over time the group with face burns scored lower. The overall difference in recovery between survivors with and without facial burns diminished over time while the individual domains had various patterns of recovery.
