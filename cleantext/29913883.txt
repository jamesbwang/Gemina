  Aim To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of AZD1940 , a novel peripherally acting cannabinoid CB1/CB2 receptor agonist , in patients undergoing third molar surgical removal. Methods This was a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study in patients scheduled for surgical removal of an impacted lower third molar. Patients received a single oral dose of 800 μg AZD1940 , 500 mg naproxen or placebo 1.5 h before surgery. The dose of 800 μg AZD1940 was selected based on earlier data from a single dose study in man , in which it was identified as the highest well tolerated dose. Ongoing post-operative pain ( primary variable) and pain on jaw<symptom> movement<symptom> were assessed on a visual analog scale ( VAS , 0-100 mm) from 0 to 8h postoperatively , deriving the area under the curve of ongoing pain ( VAS AUC0-8h) , and of pain on jaw<symptom> movement<symptom> ( VASJM AUC0-8h). The time to requesting rescue medication ( acetaminophen) was recorded. Subjective cannabinoid effects were assessed by the visual analog mood scale ( VAMS). Results In total , 151 patients were randomized to AZD1940 ( n = 61) , placebo ( n = 59) or naproxen ( n = 31). There was no statistically significant difference in pain VAS AUC0-8h or in VASJM AUC0-8h between AZD1940 and placebo. Naproxen significantly reduced both pain VAS AUC0-8h and VASJM AUC0-8h as compared with placebo ( p < 0.0001 for both). Significantly fewer patients on naproxen requested rescue medication and the duration of time to rescue was greater , as compared with placebo , whereas there were no significant differences between AZD1940 and placebo in these outcome variables. Statistically significant increases in VAMS items `` sedated '' and `` high '' were observed after AZD1940 compared with placebo. The increases in VAMS were numerically small compared with previous findings with a centrally acting cannabinoid. The most commonly observed adverse events ( AE) on treatment with AZD1940 were postural dizziness<symptom> ( 80 % of subjects) , nausea<symptom> ( 26 %) , hypotension<symptom> ( 21 %) and headache<symptom> ( 13 %) , most AE being mild to moderate. Conclusion The CB1/CB2 receptor agonist AZD1940 did not reduce post-operative pain after lower third molar surgical removal at doses exerting subjective cannabinoid effects. Implications Activation of peripheral CB1/CB2 receptors per se is probably of less clinical relevance for the treatment of acute nociceptive pain in man.
