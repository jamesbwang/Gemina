  Although disability has been on the psychological agenda for some time , there is limited empirical evidence on the life satisfaction of youth with a disability , especially the effect of discrimination and factors that might mitigate it. We address this critical gap by examining the complex social experiences of youth with a disability and the culminating effect on life satisfaction. We ask three questions: ( 1) Is having a disability associated with lower life satisfaction? ( 2) Do youth with a disability experience discrimination and , if so , how does this affect life satisfaction? ( 3) Can a sense of belonging mitigate the negative effect of discrimination? We address these questions using microdata from the Canadian Community Health Survey , which is nationally representative. Our sample consists of 11,997 adolescents , of whom 2193 have a disability. We find that life satisfaction is lower among youth with a disability. Moreover , many experience disability-related discrimination , which has a negative effect on life satisfaction. However , this is mitigated by a sense of belonging to the community. Specifically , youth with a disability do not report lower life satisfaction when high belonging is present , even if they experience discrimination. This is true for boys and girls. We conclude that belonging , even if it is not disability-related , is protective of well-being. This has important implications for policy whereby organizations that cultivate a sense of belonging may alleviate the harm sustained by youth who experience discrimination as a result of their disability.
