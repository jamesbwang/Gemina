  A 37-year-old woman with pheochromocytoma underwent presurgical FDG PET/CT. Despite her usual antiadrenergic medication consisting in 25 mg of carvedilol , PET/CT demonstrated intense and widespread FDG uptake in brown adipose tissue ( BAT). No BAT FDG uptake was detectable on a repeated examination after specific preparation consisting in 40 mg propranolol and 5 mg diazepam. We therefore recommend this propranolol-diazepam preparation in patients with pheochromocytoma referred for PET/CT. Carvedilol-classically prescribed to alleviate effects of adrenergic overstimulation-seems ineffective on BAT. This observation questions the benefit of carvedilol to reduce Î²3-adrenoreceptor-mediated effects , not only in BAT , but also in other tissues.
