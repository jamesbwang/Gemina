  This study investigated the effects of thermal manipulation ( TM) during embryonic days 12 to 18 on the cloacal temperature ( Tc) and the kinetics of muscle mRNA levels of heat shock<symptom> proteins 70 and 60 ( Hsp70 and Hsp60) and heat shock<symptom> factors 3 and 4 ( HSF3 and HSF4) during the first week of life and during thermal stress ( TS). One thousand five hundred fertile chicken eggs were randomly divided into 5 groups: control group ( 37.8 °C) , TM1 ( 38.5 °C for 18 h) , TM2 ( 39 °C for 18 h) , TM3 ( 39.5 °C for 18 h) , and TM4 ( 40 °C for 18 h). On post-hatch days 14 and 28 of age , 30 randomly selected chicks from each group were thermally stressed at 41.0 °C for 6 h , while another 30 randomly selected chicks from each group were kept under thermo-neutral conditions. The Tc of TM chicks was only numerically lower than that of the control during the study period. However , during TS at days 14 and 28 of age , the Tc of TM chicks was significantly lower than that of the controls. On post-hatch days 14 and 28 , the basal mRNA levels of Hsps and HSFs were significantly higher than those of the control. Furthermore , during TS , rapid increases in the mRNA levels of Hsps and HSFs in the TM groups were observed. These results indicate that , as well as altering their basal mRNA levels during the first week post-hatch , TM also altered the dynamics of the mRNA expression of HSPs and HSFs , which was associated with improved acquisition of thermotolerance during TS.
