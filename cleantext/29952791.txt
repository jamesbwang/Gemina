  Successful noncommunicable disease ( NCD) management requires a reliable supply chain. The objectives of this article are to examine lessons learned from HIV<pathogen> supply chain initiatives , describe opportunities to advance supply chain systems for NCD health commodities based on HIV<pathogen> supply chain successes and identify areas where additional research is still needed for reliable NCD supply chains in LMICs. We describe practical experiences gained from developing HIV<pathogen> supply chain systems and how those lessons can be used to inform NCD supply chain systems. Supply chain challenges with HIV<pathogen> commodities in low and middle-income countries ( LMICs) are identified and categorized using literature review and expert experiences. Solutions are described on the basis of lessons learned from global HIV<pathogen> initiatives. Opportunities to further advance NCD supply chain systems are recommended. Supply chain challenges can be organized into two groups: 1) resource mobilization and 2) resource utilization. Global HIV<pathogen> initiatives have responded to resource mobilization challenges by increasing availability of funding , filling human resource gaps , improving essential storage and creating better transport mechanisms and information technology infrastructure. These initiatives have assisted in better resource utilization by strengthening procurement processes , standardizing and simplifying supply chain systems , reducing integrity and security vulnerabilities and harnessing the power of better data. Advances achieved through HIV<pathogen> initiatives are readily transferrable to NCD supply chains with minimal additional investment. Research opportunities exist to identify the most efficient and cost-effective ways to develop more reliable supply chains for NCDs.
