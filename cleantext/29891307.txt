  A novel water-soluble polysaccharide ( named ALP-1) was successfully isolated from the stem barks of Acanthopanax leucorrhizus by hot-water extraction , and further purified by Cellulose DEAE-52 and Sephadex G-100 chromatography. The structure of ALP-1 was characterized by HPLC , HPGPC , partial acid hydrolysis , periodate oxidation , Smith degradation , methylation , together with UV , IR and NMR spectral analysis. The antioxidant activities also were evaluated in vitro. Structural analysis revealed that ALP-1 was a homogeneous galactan with the average molecular weight of 169 kDa , composed of galactose , glucose , mannose and arabinose in a molar ratio of 6.1:2.1:1.1:1.0 , owning a backbone structure of 1,6-linked α-d-Galp residues with some branches of α-d-Manp- ( 1 → 3)- α-l-Araf residues at O-3 and α-d-Galp residues at O-4 of 1,6-linked α-d-Galp. Antioxidant assay showed that ALP-1 exhibited strong DPPH and HO scavenging activities , as well as ferric-reducing antioxidant power. These results provide a scientific basis for the further use of polysaccharides from A. leucorrhizus.
