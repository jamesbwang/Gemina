  The time and conditions may not be suitable for performing polysomnography ( PSG) before urgent or emergent surgeries , for example , a coronary artery bypass graft. Unavailability in many centers , critical clinical situation , and inability to arrange a timely scheduled appointment are other limitations for PSG. In this study , we aimed to investigate if the STOPBANG Questionnaire may predict obstructive sleep apnea syndrome<disease> ( OSAS) related postoperative pulmonary alterations during coronary artery surgery. Sixty-one subjects who were scheduled to undergo elective isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery and were consulted for preoperative pulmonary assessment were recruited to the study. The STOP-BANG Questionnaire was used with the subjects; then their relationship with postoperative complications was assessed. Results of the STOP-BANG Questionnaire revealed that 36.1 % of subjects were at high risk for OSAS. Three groups were established according to the STOP-BANG Questionnaire ( low risk , group 1; moderate risk , group 2; high risk , group 3) and study parameters , including PEEP value in ventilator , detection of apnea at ventilator , CPAP time after extubation , S The STOP-BANG Questionnaire may predict the OSAS risk and OSAS-related pulmonary complications for patients who are candidates for a coronary artery bypass graft and unable to be evaluated with PSG before surgery due to technical or time-related limitations.
