  In this study , 16 family caregivers of patients with lymphoma were interviewed on their changing perceptions of hope. The changing process starts from diagnosis to the present treatment state. We found that the changing perception of hope can be divided into three stages: the stage of generalized hope focusing merely on treatment and passive hope focusing on harm-avoidance , the stage of specified hope and active hope aiming at comfort-seeking , and the stage of multifaceted hope. Family caregivers ' understanding of the past experience of and new information on the disease are the foundation of the perception of hope. The perception of hope in cancer patients ' family caregivers develops from `` therapeutic hope '' to `` psychosocial hope , '' shifting from `` consequential hope '' to `` procedural hope. ''
