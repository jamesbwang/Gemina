  Monodentate phosphine ligands are frequently employed in the Ni-catalyzed C-O functionalization of aryl esters. However , the extensive body of preparative work on such reactions contrasts with the lack of information concerning the structure and reactivity of the relevant nickel intermediates. In fact , experimental evidence for a seemingly trivial oxidative addition into the C-O bond of aryl esters with monodentate phosphines and low-valent nickel complexes still remains elusive. Herein , we report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the Ni ( 0)/ PCy
