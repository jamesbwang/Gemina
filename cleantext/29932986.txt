  To identify opportunities to improve care value for children with disabilities ( CWD) , we examined CWD prevalence within a commercially insured population and compared outpatient care quality and annual health plan spending levels for CWD relative to children with complex medical conditions without disabilities , children with chronic conditions that are not complex , and children without disabling , complex , or chronic conditions. Cross-sectional study of 1,118,081 person-years of Blue Cross Blue Shield Massachusetts data for beneficiaries aged 1-19 years old during 2008-2012. We combined the newly developed and validated Children with Disabilities Algorithm with the Pediatric Medical Complexity Algorithm to identify CWD and non-CWD sub-groups. We used 14 validated and/or National Quality Forum-endorsed measures to assess outpatient care quality and paid claims to examine annual plan spending levels and components. CWD constituted 4.5 % of all enrollees. Care quality for CWD was between 11-59 % for 8 of 14 quality measures and > 80 % for the 6 remaining measures , and generally comparable to that for non-CWD sub-groups. Annual plan spending among CWD had a median and mean 23 % and 53 % higher than that for children with complex medical conditions without disabilities , respectively; CWD mean/median values were higher than for all other groups as well. CWD were prevalent in our commercially insured population. CWD experienced sub-optimal levels of care , but those levels were comparable to non-CWD groups. Improving the care value for CWD involves a deeper understanding of what higher spending delivers and additional aspects of care quality.
