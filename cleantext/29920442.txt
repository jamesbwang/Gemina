  Self-assembly of surfactants is influenced by various intermolecular interactions and molecular structure , which dictate packing of molecules in the aggregate and its microstructure. Hydrogen-bonding between amide groups plays a key role in the self-assembly process of N-acyl amino acid surfactants ( NAAS). The self-assembly properties of two NAAS , sodium N-lauroyl sarcosinate ( SLS) and sodium N-lauroyl glycinate ( SLG) that differ only in the head-group structure were compared in aqueous and aqueo-organic media by using a number of methods , including surface tension fluorescence , dynamic light scattering , calorimetry , and microscopy. It was observed that aggregate formation is more favoured in SLG. Studies revealed that while SLS formed small spherical micelles , SLG produced unilamellar vesicles in pH 7 buffer above critical micelle concentration at 25 Â°C. The stability of SLG vesicles with respect to pH and temperature was also investigated. Furthermore , both SLG and SLS were found to gelify aquo-organic mixtures of varying composition upon heat-cool treatment. Their gelation behaviour was compared by measuring minimum gelation concentration , molecular packing , and morphology and mechanical stability of the thermoreversible gels. The difference in self-assembly behaviour in water as well as in aqueo-organic mixtures was attributed to the steric repulsion and hydrogen-bonding interaction at the head-group of the molecules.
