  Traditionally , the solution to reduce parameter dimensionality in a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK) model is through expert judgment. However , this approach may lead to bias in parameter estimates and model predictions if important parameters are fixed at uncertain or inappropriate values. The purpose of this study was to explore the application of global sensitivity analysis ( GSA) to ascertain which parameters in the PBPK model are non-influential , and therefore can be assigned fixed values in Bayesian parameter estimation with minimal bias. We compared the elementary effect-based Morris method and three variance-based Sobol indices in their ability to distinguish `` influential '' parameters to be estimated and `` non-influential '' parameters to be fixed. We illustrated this approach using a published human PBPK model for acetaminophen ( APAP) and its two primary metabolites APAP-glucuronide and APAP-sulfate. We first applied GSA to the original published model , comparing Bayesian model calibration results using all the 21
