  To identify in our setting the outcome of labor among women admitted at advanced cervical dilatation. This prospective cohort study was carried out between 1 December 2015 and 31 March 2016. Women carrying live term singletons in vertex presentation admitted with a cervical dilatation > 5 cm ( late arrival group) or â‰¤ 5 cm ( early arrival group) were followed up till delivery. The main variables studied included mode of delivery , genital lacerations , and postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> ( PPH). Data from women in both groups were compared. Fisher 's exact test and t-test were used for comparison. p < .05 was considered statistically significant. Late arrival in the labor ward was observed in 52.5 % of women ( 126/240). Late arrival in the labor ward was significantly associated with a reduction in the cesarean section ( CS) risk ( Relative risk ( RR) 0.34 , 95 % CI 0.12-0.94) , but with an increased risk of lower genital tract lacerations ( RR 2.3 , 95 % CI 1.3-3.8) , PPH ( RR 4.5 , 95 % CI 1.04-20.2) , and admission of the newborn in the neonatal intensive care unit for neonatal asphyxia or infection ( RR 3.6 , 95 % CI 1.04-12.5). Late arrival in the labor ward was associated with an increased risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity. Therefore , women should be encouraged to arrive early in the labor ward.
