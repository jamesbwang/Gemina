  Cactus roots function as a hydraulic safety valve by conducting available water quickly and preventing water loss under drought condition. In particular , the root-stem ( R-S) junction is responsible for effective water transport by direct coupling of the water absorptive thin roots and the moisture-filled bulky stem. In this study , the morphological features of the R-S junction were observed by using X-ray micro-imaging technique. Their structural and functional characteristics were also elucidated according to a hydrodynamic viewpoint. With regard to the axial water transport through xylem , the R-S junction prevents water leakage by embolizing large-scale vessels with relatively high hydraulic conductivity. In addition , the axial theoretical hydraulic conductivity of xylem vessels from the roots to the stem drastically increases to facilitate water absorption and prevent water loss. The cortex cell layer of a cactus is thinner than that of other plant species. In the viewpoint of radial conductivity , this property can be the hydraulic strategy of the cactus R-S junction to transport water quickly from the root surface into the xylem. These results suggest that the R-S junction functions as a hydraulic safety valve that can maximize water uptake in axial and radial directions at limited rainfall. This junction can also prevent the stem from leaking water under drought condition.
