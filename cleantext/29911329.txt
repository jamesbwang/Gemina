  Portugal presents both a high prevalence of Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori ( Hp) infection and a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance. However , conclusive data on its magnitude are lacking. We aimed at summarizing the existing data. A systematic review was conducted after searching in two databases ( PubMed and SciELO). Meta-analysis was performed , and comparison of resistance rates between children and adults and by type of resistance ( primary and secondary) was made. Eight cross-sectional studies assessing Hp resistance to antibiotics were included. Overall resistance rates were as follows: clarithromycin ( CLA) 42 % ( 95 % CI: 30-54) , metronidazole ( MTZ) 25 % ( 95 % CI: 15-38) , ciprofloxacin ( CIP) 9 % ( 95 % CI: 3-18) , levofloxacin ( LVX) 18 % ( 95 % CI: 2-42) , tetracycline ( TTC) 0.2 % ( 95 % CI: 0-1) , and amoxicillin ( AMX) 0.1 % ( 95 % CI: 0-0.2). Multidrug resistance was also an important problem , with the following global resistance rates: CLA plus MTZ of 10 % ( adults 20 % ( 95 % CI: 15-26) vs children 6 % ( 95 % CI: 4-9)) and CLA plus CIP of 2 % ( primary resistance in children 's group). High secondary resistance rates were found for all antibiotics. Resistance was higher among adults for all antibiotics , except CLA that had high resistance levels both among adults and children ( 42 % 95 % CI: 14-71 and 40 % 95 % CI: 33-47). Hp resistance to the most widely used antibiotics is high in Portugal. Accordingly , our results suggest that the best therapeutic strategy for Hp in Portugal may be quadruple therapy with bismuth for adults and triple therapy including AMX plus MTZ or bismuth-based therapy for children.
