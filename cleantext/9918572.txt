  Anti-cancer effects of local anesthetics have been reported but the mode of action remains elusive. Here , we examined the bioenergetic and REDOX impact of levobupivacaine on human prostate cancer cells ( DU145) and corresponding non-cancer primary human prostate cells ( BHP). Levobupivacaine induced a combined inhibition of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells , resulting in a reduced cellular ATP production and consecutive bioenergetic crisis , along with reactive oxygen species generation. The dose-dependent inhibition of respiratory chain complex I activity by levobupivacaine explained the alteration of mitochondrial energy fluxes. Furthermore , the potency of levobupivacaine varied with glucose and oxygen availability as well as the cellular energy demand , in accordance with a bioenergetic anti-cancer mechanism. The levobupivacaine-induced bioenergetic crisis triggered cytostasis in prostate cancer cells as evidenced by a S-phase cell cycle arrest , without apoptosis induction. In DU145 cells , levobupivacaine also triggered the induction of autophagy and blockade of this process potentialized the anti-cancer effect of the local anesthetic. Therefore , our findings provide a better characterization of the REDOX mechanisms underpinning the anti-effect of levobupivacaine against human prostate cancer cells.
