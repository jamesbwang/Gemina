  Endoreplication , a modified cell cycle in which DNA is replicated without subsequent cell division , plays an important but poorly understood role in plant growth and in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. The Arabidopsis thaliana SIAMESE ( SIM) gene encodes the first identified member of the SIAMESE-RELATED ( SMR) family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. SIM controls endoreplication during trichome development , and sim mutant trichomes divide several times instead of endoreplicating their DNA. The SMR family is defined by several short linear amino acid sequence motifs of largely unknown function , and family members have little sequence similarity to any known protein functional domains. Here , we investigated the roles of the conserved motifs in SIM site-directed Arabidopsis mutants using several functional assays. We identified a potential cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK) binding site , which bears no resemblance to other known CDK interaction motifs. We also identified a potential site of phosphorylation and two redundant nuclear localization sequences. Surprisingly , the only motif with similarity to the other family of plant CDK inhibitors , the INHIBITOR/INTERACTOR OF CDC2 KINASE/KIP-RELATED PROTEIN ( ICK/KRP) proteins , is not required for SIM function in vivo. Because even highly divergent members of the SMR family are able to replace SIM function in Arabidopsis trichomes , it is likely that the results obtained here for SIM will apply to other members of this plant-specific family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.
