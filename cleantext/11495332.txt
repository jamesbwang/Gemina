  This article provides a description and preliminary assessment of the Maryland Opportunities through Vouchers Experiment ( MOVE) , a randomized housing mobility program for former prisoners designed to test whether residential relocation far away from former neighborhoods , incentivized through the provision of a housing subsidy , can yield reductions in recidivism. The MOVE program was implemented as a randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited from four different Maryland prisons and randomly assigned to experimental groups. In the first iteration of the experiment , treatment group participants received 6 months of free housing away from their home jurisdiction and control group participants received free housing back in their home jurisdiction. In the second iteration of the experiment , the treatment group remained the same and the control condition was redesigned to represent the status quo and did not receive free housing. Analyses were conducted of one-year rearrest rates. With respect to reductions in recidivism , pilot results suggest that there is some benefit to moving and a benefit to receiving free housing. Rearrest was lower among the treatment group of movers than the non-movers , and was also lower for non-movers who received free housing versus non-movers who did not receive housing. To the extent that pilot results can be validated and replicated in a full-scale implementation of the MOVE program , policies that provide greater access to housing assistance for formerly incarcerated individuals may yield substantial public safety benefits , particularly housing opportunities located far away from former neighborhoods.
