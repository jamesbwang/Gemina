  Urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( UTIs<disease>) are one of the most prevalent infectious<disease> diseases<disease> and can lead to a high rate of morbidity and mortality. The emergence of multiple-drug resistant strains , particularly extended-spectrum beta-lactamases ( ESBLs) producing strains , has become a global healthcare concern. Our study sought to investigate the antimicrobial resistance pattern and presence of integrons and This cross-sectional study was performed on 121 Ampicillin ( 9.1 %) and nalidixic acid ( 19.0 %) showed the lowest level of antibiotic susceptibility. The highest level of susceptibility was toward imipenem ( 77.7 %). The rate of ESBL-producing isolates was 42.1 %. There was a significant association between production of ESBLs and higher antibiotic resistance in the tested isolates. Of the investigated virulence and resistance genes , The remarkable rate of ESBL-producing UPEC isolates accompanied with the presence of integrons suggest the necessity of restricted infection control policies to prevent further dissemination of resistant strains.
