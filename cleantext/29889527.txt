  Ultrasonic frequency is one of the most important parameters that decides the characteristics of acoustic cavitation. Low- ( 16-50 kHz) and high- ( â‰¥ 200 kHz) frequency ultrasounds present opposite physical and chemical behaviors and have been extensively studied , yet frequencies in between are poorly characterized. In this study , acoustic cavitation at the intermediate ultrasonic frequency of 100 kHz is compared with that at 20 kHz and at 362 kHz by different experimental investigations: sonochemical yield ( H
