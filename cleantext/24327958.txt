  Cracking the cytoarchitectural organization , activity patterns , and neurotransmitter nature of genetically-distinct cell types in the lateral hypothalamus ( LH) is fundamental to develop a mechanistic understanding of how activity dynamics within this brain region are generated and operate together through synaptic connections to regulate circuit function. However , the precise mechanisms through which LH circuits orchestrate such dynamics have remained elusive due to the heterogeneity of the intermingled and functionally distinct cell types in this brain region. Here we reveal that a cell type in the mouse LH identified by the expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin ( PVALB; LHPV) is fast-spiking , releases the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate , and sends long range projections throughout the brain. Thus , our findings challenge long-standing concepts that define neurons with a fast-spiking phenotype as exclusively GABAergic. Furthermore , we provide for the first time a detailed characterization of the electrophysiological properties of these neurons. Our work identifies LHPV neurons as a novel functional component within the LH glutamatergic circuitry.
