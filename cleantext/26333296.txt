  The technological and experimental progress in electrochemical imaging of biological specimens is discussed with a view on potential applications for skin cancer diagnostics , reproductive medicine and microbial testing. The electrochemical analysis of single cell activity inside cell cultures , 3D cellular aggregates and microtissues is based on the selective detection of electroactive species involved in biological functions. Electrochemical imaging strategies , based on nano/micrometric probes scanning over the sample and sensor array chips , respectively , can be made sensitive and selective without being affected by optical interference as many other microscopy techniques. The recent developments in microfabrication , electronics and cell culturing/tissue engineering have evolved in affordable and fast-sampling electrochemical imaging platforms. We believe that the topics discussed herein demonstrate the applicability of electrochemical imaging devices in many areas related to cellular functions.
