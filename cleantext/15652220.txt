  Information about species distribution is crucial to ecological studies. Environmental DNA ( eDNA) analysis has recently been used to estimate the distribution of aquatic organisms. Several analytical methods including metabarcoding and species-specific PCR are being used for eDNA analysis. However , when only a few species are targeted , metabarcoding is not cost-effective because of the wasted consumption of read due to amplification of non-target species DNA. On the other hand , species-specific PCR requires tests to be repeated multiple times resulting in consuming more DNA templates , and experimental consumables. Here we propose a methodological framework for simultaneously detecting a few species using real-time multiplex PCR. We developed the species-specific primer-probe sets for two species of Japanese medaka ( Oryzias latipes and o. sakaizumii) , and we used them in the real-time multiplex PCR. In aquarium experiment , even when the species abundances were biased , both species were simultaneously detected in all samples. In a field survey , eDNA analysis and capture survey produced consistent results in all sampling sites , including sites with low fish densities. eDNA analysis using real-time multiplex PCR can be easily applied to other aquatic organisms , enabling a more cost-effective distribution survey of multiple target organisms.
