  Citrofulvicin ( 1) , along with its early shunt product fulvionol ( 2) , was characterized as a skeletally unprecedented antiosteoporotic agent from a human sputum-derived fungus Penicillium<pathogen> velutinum. The unique citrofulvicin framework is likely formed by a nonenzymatic intermolecular Diels-Alder cycloaddition between heptaketide-based intermediates. Citrofulvicin and fulvionol were demonstrated to be osteogenic at 0.1 Î¼M in the prednisolone-induced osteoporotic zebrafish.
