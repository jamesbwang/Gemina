  The majority of acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML) patients will die from their disease or therapy-related complications. There is an inevitable need to improve the survival of AML patients. Previous studies show that disulfiram ( DSF) , an anti-alcoholism drug with a low toxicity profile , demonstrates anticancer behaviors. Here , we evaluated the cytotoxicity and mechanistic action of DSF on the AML cell lines KG-1 , NB4 , and U937. The microculture tetrazolium test revealed that DSF alone or in combination with copper ( Cu) is highly toxic to the AML cells at concentrations lower than those achievable in the clinical setting , with Cu increasing the DSF-induced inhibition of metabolic activity. Flow cytometric analysis and QRT-PCR indicated that in the two cell lines , NB4 and U-937 , DSF/Cu increased reactive oxygen species ( ROS) levels in association with the induction of superoxide dismutase 2 ( SOD2) expression and suppression of catalase ( CAT). In the KG-1 cell line , DSF/Cu reduced the ROS levels in agreement with the induction of CAT expression. The cell cycle and apoptosis assessment by flow cytometry demonstrated that DSF/Cu induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These were associated with the increased expression of FOXO tumor suppressors , decreased expression of the MYC oncogene and the modulation of their known target genes related to the cell cycle and apoptosis. Therefore , DSF/Cu caused the disturbance of the ROS balance<symptom> , cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in AML cells in coordination with the modulation in expression of their related genes. These results propose the possible use of DSF in AML therapies.
