  Pregnane & Xenobiotic Receptor ( PXR) is one of the 48 members of the ligand-modulated transcription factors belonging to nuclear receptor superfamily. Though PXR is now well-established as a ` xenosensor ' , regulating the central detoxification and drug metabolizing machinery , it has also emerged as a key player in several metabolic disorders. This makes PXR attractive to both , researchers and pharmaceutical industry since clinical success of small drug molecules can be pre-evaluated on PXR platform. At the early stages of drug discovery , cell-based assays are used for high-throughput screening of small molecules. The future success or failure of a drug can be predicted by this approach saving expensive resources and time. In view of this , we have developed human liver cell line-based , dual-level screening and validation protocol on PXR platform having application to assess small molecules. We have generated two different stably transfected cell lines , ( i) a stable promoter-reporter cell line ( HepXREM) expressing PXR and a commonly used CYP3A4 promoter-reporter i.e. XREM-luciferase; and ( ii) two stable cell lines integrated with proximal PXR-promoter-reporter ( Hepx-1096/ +43 and Hepx-497/ +43). Employing HepXREM , Hepx-1096/ +43 and Hepx-497/ +43 stable cell lines > 25 anti-cancer herbal drug ingredients were screened for examining their modulatory effects on a) PXR transcriptional activity and , b) PXR-promoter activity. In conclusion , the present report provides a convenient and economical , dual-level screening system to facilitate the identification of superior therapeutic small molecules.
