  It is a novel competitive challenge for electrochemical biosensor to directly , rapidly and ultrasensitively detect the disease markers in the whole serum due to biofouling caused by the complexity of actual samples. In this paper , poly ( ethylene glycol) ( PEG) and hyaluronic acid ( HA) were utilized to modify Fe
