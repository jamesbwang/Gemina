  Moving towards more integrative approaches within the invasion sciences has been recognized as a means of improving linkages between science , policy , and practice. Yet despite the recognition that biological invasions pose complex social-ecological challenges , the invasion literature poorly covers social-ecological or distinctly integrative research. Various initiatives and investments have been made towards building research capacity and conducting more integrative research aimed at improving the management of biological invasions. Using a combination of social network and thematic analysis approaches , and the South African Working for Water ( WfW) program as a case study for the management of invasive species , we identify and explore the roles of core authors in shaping collaboration networks and research outputs , based on bibliographic records. We found that research produced under the auspices of WfW is authored by a handful of core authors , conducting primarily ecologically-focused research , with social research significantly underrepresented. Core authors identified in this study play an essential role in mediating relationships between researchers , in addition to potentially controlling access to those seeking to form collaborations , maintaining network cohesion and connectivity across institutional and disciplinary boundaries. Research projects should be designed to span disciplines and institutions if they are to adequately address complex challenges.
