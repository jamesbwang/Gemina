  Group II introns are mobile ribozymes that are rare in bacterial genomes , often cohabiting with various mobile elements , and seldom interrupting housekeeping genes. What accounts for this distribution has not been well understood. Here , we demonstrate that Ll.LtrB , the group II intron residing in a relaxase gene on a conjugative plasmid from
