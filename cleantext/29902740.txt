  To synthesize the evidence that explored resilience and emotional intelligence in undergraduate nursing students. Nursing is a demanding profession that offers unique challenges. Emotional intelligence and resilience are traits that can allow nursing students to effectively respond to challenges in professional placements and future practice. An integrative review incorporating both quantitative and qualitative research designs. Studies in the English language were identified through a systematic search in electronic databases: CINAHL , PubMed , ERIC , Scopus and PsycINFO. No restriction dates were used and the search was up until November 1 , 2017. Methodological quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for qualitative research and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for quantitative research. Data analysis was conducted based on the integrative review method. Fourteen articles were included. A positive relationship was found between resilience and performance in undergraduate studies including professional experience placements. While some studies observed an important role for emotional intelligence for nursing students , there is currently insufficient evidence to conclude that emotional intelligence improves nursing students ' communication , academic success and retention. Developing skills , such as resilience , as part of nursing programs allows students to be better prepared to deal with the unique challenges in nursing practice.
