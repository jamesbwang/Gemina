  To assess the iodine nutrition and thyroid function of lactatingwomen in different iodine nutrition level of children in Gansu Province , and provide a scientific basis for iodine supplementation. Liangzhou district ( the median urinary iodine was greater than or equal to 300 g/L) , Linze county ( the median urinary iodine was from 200 to 299 g/L) and Huating county ( the median urinary iodine was from100 to 199 g/L) were selected according to 8-10 years old children urinary iodine in2009. Huating county , Liangzhou district and Linze county were as iodine excessive area , iodine suitable area 1 and iodine suitable area 2 , respectively in 2014. One township was randomly selected from the east , west , south , north and middle parts of each research point , 10 lactating women were randomly collected in each township , who was tested urine samples and thyroid function. Salt intake was surveyed in 3 townships. 2 samples were collected in centralized water supplies , 1 sample was collected in its coverage by the east , west , south , north and middle parts; 1 sample was collected by the east , west , south , north and middle parts in decentralized water supplies , which were tested of water iodine. The medians of water iodine were 2. 32 , 0. 70 and 6. 18 μg/L and the medians of salt iodine were 25. 3 , 25. 0 and 28. 6 mg/kg for iodine excessive area , iodine suitable area 1 and iodine suitable area 2 , respectively. Per capita daily intake of salt were 15. 0 , 11. 3 and 4. 7 g for iodine excessive area , iodine suitable area 1 and iodine suitable area 2 respectively , there were statisticant differences. The median urinary iodine of lactating women were 181. 8 , 143. 1 and 104. 9 μg/L for iodine excessive area , iodine suitable area 1 and iodine suitable area 2 , respectively. The medians of thyroidstimulating hormone ( TSH) were 2. 3 , 2. 2 and 1. 9 mIU/L , mean values of free thyroxine ( FT4) were 15. 0 , 13. 9 and 14. 6 pmol/L , mean values of free triidothyronine ( FT3) were 5. 0 , 4. 8 and 4. 6 pmol/L for iodine excessive area , iodine suitable area 1 and iodine suitable area 2 respectively , there were not statistically differences. The positive rate of thyromicrosomal antibody ( Tm Ab) were 3. 6 % , 11. 3 % and 13. 2 % and the positive rate of thyroglobulin antibody ( Tg Ab) were 3. 6 % , 11. 3 % and 11. 3 % for iodine excessive area , iodine suitable area 1 and iodine suitable area 2 respectively ( P > 0. 05). Prevalence of thyroid function disorders were 14. 3 % , 21. 0 % and 9. 4 % and prevalence of low-FT4 syndrome<disease> were 7. 1 % , 4. 8 % and 1. 9 % , prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism were 3. 6 % , 11. 3 % and 3. 8 % for iodine excessive area , iodine suitable area 1 and iodine suitable area 2 respectively ( P > 0. 05). Iodine nutrition level was appropriate for lactating women in 3 areas , but some lactating women were iodine deficiency or iodine excess. There were occurred thyroid function disorders in some lactating women in 3 areas. The lactating women 's iodine nutrition and thyroid function should be monitored and the normal reference value of thyroid function on lactating women should be established also.
