  We present cases of blinding spontaneous suprachoroidal haemorrhage in anticoagulant taking wet-AMD patients. A retrospective study has been performed to present the clinical course , management and final outcome of spontaneous suprachoroidal haemorrhage in 7 eyes of six age-related macular degeneration patients seen in our clinic from January 2016 to April 2017. All patients were on chronic oral anticoagulant therapy because of cardiovascular disorder. In one patient , haematological disorder was also present modifying significantly the haemostasis. All eyes received prior anti-VEGF treatment for exsudative AMD. Acute angle closure glaucoma- with no response to topical and oral IOP lowering therapy- was the most frequent ocular complication in our cases. The final visual prognosis was usually very poor. The risk of spontaneous suprachoroidal haemorrhage is increased in wet-AMD patients who are on anticoagulant therapy. To prevent this blinding condition , a stronger communication between ophthalmologists and cardiologists would be beneficial , with an ophthalmological check-up in this group of patients before and during the use of anticoagulants.
