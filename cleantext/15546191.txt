  A highly-reactive vinyl ether-functionalized aliphatic polycarbonate and its block copolymer were developed as templates for multiple post-polymerization conjugation chemistries. The vinyl ether-functional six-membered cyclic carbonate monomer was synthesized by a well-established two-step procedure starting from 2,2-bis ( hydroxymethyl) propionic acid. An organobase-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of the synthesized monomer afforded polycarbonates with pendant vinyl ether functionalities ( PMVEC). The vinyl ether moieties on the resulting polymers were readily conjugated with hydroxyl- or thiol-containing compounds
