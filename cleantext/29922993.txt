  The aim of this study was to assess the levels of human papilloma virus ( HPV) infection and vaccination awareness among members of the general population across three Nigerian States. A descriptive cross-sectional study among 758 persons selected by convenience sampling was conducted from March to July 2016. Structured questionnaires were administered to consenting participants and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods in SPSS V20. Awareness to HPV infection and vaccination was very low at 1.40 Â± 1.803 out of 6 points. Only 31.97 % of respondents had heard about HPV while 17.5 % were aware of the existence of a vaccine. The most prevalent sources of information amongst respondents who had heard about HPV were Doctors ( 13.08 %) and the Media ( 9.91 %). Bivariate analysis showed that respondents who consulted with gynaecologists , knew someone who had cervical cancer or had received HPV vaccination were more likely to be aware of HPV infection and vaccination. Gynaecologists ( p < 0.0001) and previous vaccination ( p < 0.0001) were the most important contributors to HPV awareness in a multivariate analysis. This study underpins the need for urgent intervention to raise awareness for HPV.
