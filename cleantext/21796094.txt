  Physical activity ( PA) promotion is beneficial to gain and maintain optimal health , but might increase risks for physical activity-related injury ( PARI). This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the incidence rate and identify risk factors of PARI among Chinese middle school students. Selected via the method of cluster random sampling , students graded 7 ⁻ 8 ( junior) and 10 ⁻ 11 ( senior) from five middle schools ( aged from 10 to 18 years old) in Shantou were invited to participate in the survey. Information on socio-demography , PA involvement , sleep duration , individual safety awareness and exercise behavior , and PARI experiences in the past 12 month was collected. Multivariate logistic regression model was performed to estimate the risk factors of PARI. A total of 3082 participants completed the valid questionnaires , with an overall incidence rate of 25.1 %. Boys , junior school students , sports team members , and those with lower safety awareness , living with single parent , and without any chronic conditions were at higher risks for PARI. Moreover , exercising on wet floor or with illness frequently would also be more likely to experience injury , especially those with at least 120 min per day. In conclusion , PARI was prevalent among middle school students in southern China. The above data provide insights that were focused and effective actions should be taken to prevent school-aged adolescents from PARI and maximize the benefits of PA..
