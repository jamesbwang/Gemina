  Competition elicits different psychological and cardiovascular responses depending on a person 's skills. Decision-making has been considered a distal factor that influences competition , but there are no studies analyzing this relationship. Our objective was to analyze whether decision-making affects the response to competition. Specifically , we aimed to test whether good performers on a decision-making test , the Iowa Gambling Task ( IGT) , showed an adaptive cardiovascular response to competition. In all , 116 participants ( 44 women) performed the IGT and were classified into Good or Poor<symptom> decision-makers. Subsequently , they were exposed to a stress task in two different conditions: a face-to-face competition ( winners/losers) or a control condition , while an electrocardiogram was recorded. In the competition group , good decision-makers increased their high-frequency respect to the total heart rate variability ( HF/HRV) levels during the task , compared to Poor<symptom> decision-makers. Again , competition group good decision-makers , showed lower LF and higher HF/HRV reactivity than the control group , which represents lower HRV stress pattern. Moreover , in the group of losers , good decision-makers had a decline in low frequency ( LF) during the task and faster recovery than poor decision-makers. In conclusion , good decision-makers have a more adaptive stress response and higher levels of mental effort , based on total HRV interpretation. Decision-making skills could be a factor in a more adaptive cardiovascular response to competition.
