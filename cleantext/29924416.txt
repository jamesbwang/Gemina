  Anti-nuclear antibodies ( ANA) , anti-extractable nuclear antigens ( ENA) and anti-dsDNA antibodies are often associated with cutaneous lupus erythematosus ( CLE) , with variable frequency depending on skin subtype. However , specific data based on large case-series on the pathogenetic , diagnostic and prognostic meaning of such autoantibodies are still lacking. To characterize the correlations between CLE subtypes as well as LE-non-specific skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> and their autoantibody pattern. Epidemiological , clinical and immunopathological data of 619 Italian patients with CLE and LE-non-specific skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> were analysed. Differences in age , sex , clinical features and autoantibody profile were evaluated in each LE subgroup. Anti-nuclear antibodies ( P < 0.0001) , anti-dsDNA ( P < 0.0001) , ENA ( P = 0.001) , anti-Sm ( P = 0.001) , anti-RNP ( P = 0.004) and anti-histone ( P = 0.005) antibodies were associated with SLE. A strong association between ANA ( P < 0.0001) and anti-dsDNA ( P < 0.0001) and female gender was also found: positive ANA and positive anti-dsDNA had a higher prevalence among females. Chronic CLE resulted to be negatively associated with ENA ( OR = 0.51 , P < 0.0001) , anti-Ro/SSA ( OR = 0.49 , P < 0.0001) and anti-dsDNA ( OR = 0.37 , P < 0.0001). Intermittent CLE resulted to be negatively associated with ENA ( OR = 0.50 , P = 0.007) and ANA ( OR = 0.61 , P = 0.025). Subacute CLE resulted to be associated with ENA ( OR = 5.19 , P < 0.0001) , anti-Ro/SSA ( OR = 3.83 , P < 0.0001) , anti-Smith ( OR = 2.95 , P = 0.004) and anti-RNP ( OR = 3.18 , P = 0.007). Acute CLE resulted to be strongly associated with anti-dsDNA ( OR = 6.0 , P < 0.0001) and ANA ( OR = 18.1 , P < 0.0001). LE-non-specific skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> resulted to be significantly associated with systemic involvement. Livedo reticularis was significantly associated with ENA ( P = 0.007) and anti-Ro/SSA ( P = 0.036). Palpable purpura and periungual telangiectasia were significantly associated with ANA. According to our findings , some well-known associations between CLE subtypes and autoantibody profile were confirmed; moreover , specific association between autoantibodies and LE-non-specific skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> was highlighted. A strict association between anti-ENA and anti-Ro/SSA antibodies and livedo reticularis , ANA and palpable purpura , and ANA and periungual telangiectasia was evidenced.
