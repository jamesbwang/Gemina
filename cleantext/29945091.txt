  Both rhizobia and non-rhizobial endophytes ( NRE) are inhabitants of legume nodules<symptom>. The biogeography of rhizobia has been well investigated , but little is known about the spatial distribution and community assemblage of NRE. By using high-throughput sequencing , we compared biogeographic patterns of rhizobial and non-rhizobial subcommunities and investigated their bacterial co-occurrence patterns in nodules<symptom> collected from 50 soybean fields across China. Dispersal probability was lower in NRE than in rhizobia , as revealed by a significant distance-decay relationship found in NRE , but not in rhizobia , in addition to a significant occupancy-abundance relationship in the entire community. Rhizobial and NRE subcommunities were significantly influenced by different environmental and spatial variables. Moreover , the rhizobial subcommunities were grouped into Ensifer- and Bradyrhizobium-dominated clusters that were significantly related to soil pH. The non-rhizobial subcommunities were grouped into Proteobacteria- and Firmicutes-dominated clusters that were more influenced by climatic than by edaphic factors. These results demonstrated that rhizobial and non-rhizobial subcommunities are characterized by distinct biogeographic patterns. Network analysis showed rhizobia and NRE as separately grouped and uncorrelated with each other , suggesting they did not share niche space in soybean nodules<symptom>. In sum , these results broaden our knowledge of how bacteria are distributed and assemble as a community in root
