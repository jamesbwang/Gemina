  Eph/Ephrin signaling pathways are crucial in regulating a large variety of physiological processes during development , such as cell morphology , proliferation , migration and axonal guidance. EphrinA ( efn-A) ligands , in particular , can be activated by EphA receptors at cell-cell interfaces and have been proposed to cause reverse signaling via RET receptor tyrosine kinase. Such association has been reported to mediate spinal motor axon navigation , but conservation of the interactive signaling pathway and the molecular mechanism of the interaction are unclear. Here , we found Danio<pathogen> rerio<pathogen> efn-A5b bound to Mus<pathogen> musculus<pathogen> EphA4 with high affinity , revealing structurally and functionally conserved EphA/efn-A signaling. Interestingly , we observed no interaction between efn-A5b and RET from zebrafish , unlike earlier cell-based assays. Their lack of association indicates how complex efn-A signaling is and suggests that there may be other molecules involved in efn-A5-induced RET signaling.
