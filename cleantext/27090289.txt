  The incidence of proteinuria<symptom> in humans receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been well-documented. Reports of proteinuria<symptom> with this class of drugs are limited in veterinary medicine. This retrospective study describes the incidence , severity , and progression of proteinuria<symptom> in 55 dogs treated with toceranib phosphate , with or without concurrent glucocorticoid or NSAID ( non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug). Six dogs were proteinuric at baseline. Twelve of the 49 dogs that were not proteinuric at baseline developed proteinuria<symptom> while receiving toceranib phosphate. Median urine protein: creatinine ( UPC) ratio when proteinuria<symptom> developed was 0.75 ( range: 0.6 to 4.9). There was no association with intermittent glucocorticoid or NSAID use and development of proteinuria<symptom> (
