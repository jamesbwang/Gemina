  Patients with cognitive impairment or dementias of uncertain etiology are frequently referred to a memory disorders specialty clinic. The impact of and role for amyloid PET imaging ( Aβ-PET) may be most appropriate in this clinical setting. The primary objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of Aβ-PET on etiological diagnosis and clinical management in the memory clinic setting. A search of the literature on the impact of Aβ-PET in the memory clinic setting between 1 January 2004 and 12 February 2018 was conducted. Meta-analysis using a random effects model was performed to determine the pooled estimate of the impact of Aβ-PET in the changes of diagnoses and changes in management plan. After rigorous review , results from 13 studies were extracted , involving 1,489 patients. Meta-analysis revealed a pooled effect of change in diagnoses of 35.2 % ( 95 % CI 24.6-47.5). Sub-analyses showed that the pooled effect in change in diagnoses if Aβ-PET was used under the appropriate use criteria ( AUC) or non-AUC criteria were 47.8 % ( 95 % CI 25.9-70.5) and 29.6 % ( 95 % CI: 21.5-39.3) , respectively. The pooled effect of a change of diagnosis from Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) to non-AD and from non-AD to AD were 22.7 % ( 95 % CI: 17.1-29.5) and 25.6 % ( 95 % CI: 17.6-35.8) , respectively. The pooled effect leading to a change of management was 59.6 % ( 95 % CI 39.4-77.0). Aβ-PET has a highly significant impact on both changes in diagnosis and management among patients being seen at a specialty memory clinic.
