  The aim of this study was to fabricate a novel electrochemical-based DNA-sensing device for Ebola<disease> virus DNA diagnostic by an enzyme-amplified detection , which improves the sensitivity and selectivity of the sensor. A thiolated DNA capture probe sequence was immobilized on the screen printed electrode surface and hybridized with biotinylated target strand DNA for the fabrication of Ebola<disease> DNA-sensing devices. Prior to the electrochemical detection of the enzymatic product by differential pulse voltammetry ( DPV) method , the biotinylated hybrid was labeled with a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate on the surface of the working electrode. All the experiment steps were optimized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS) and the optimum condition for biosensor fabrication was achieved. A detection limit of 4.7 nM complementary oligonucleotides was obtained using the fabricated biosensor and the standard deviation of the blank solution. The last step , the selectivity and reproducibility of fabricated electrochemical DNA biosensor was obtained.
