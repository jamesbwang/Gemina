  The goal of the present study was to examine clinician , supervisor , and organizational factors that are associated with the intensity of evidence-based treatment ( EBT) focus in workplace-based clinical supervision of a specific EBT , Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( TF-CBT). Supervisors ( n = 56) and clinicians ( n = 207) from mental health organizations across Washington State completed online self-report questionnaires. Multilevel modeling ( MLM) analyses were used to examine the relative influence of nested clinician and supervisor factors on the intensity of EBT focus in supervision. We found that 33 % of the variance in clinician report of EBT supervision intensity clustered at the supervisor level and implementation climate was the only significant factor associated with EBT supervision intensity. While individual clinician and supervisor factors may play a role in EBT coverage in supervision , our results suggest that an implementation climate that supports EBT may be the most critical factor for improving intensity of EBT coverage. Thus , implementation efforts that address the extent to which EBTs are expected , rewarded , and supported within an organization may be needed to support greater coverage of EBT during workplace-based supervision.
