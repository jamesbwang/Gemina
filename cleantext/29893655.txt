  Psychological distress is a common symptom after natural disasters. Although musculoskeletal pain also increases after natural disasters , its relation to psychological distress is not known. This study aimed to examine the association of musculoskeletal pain with new-onset psychological distress among survivors of the Great East Japan Earthquake. A panel study was conducted with survivors at 2 and 3 years after the Great East Japan Earthquake. New-onset psychological distress was defined as psychological distress absent at 2 years and present at 3 years after the disaster. The number of musculoskeletal pain sites at 2 years after the disaster was divided into 3 categories ( 0 , 1 , and ≥ 2). Multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval for new-onset psychological distress according to the number of musculoskeletal pain sites. The rate of new-onset psychological distress was 6.7 %. Musculoskeletal pain was associated with new-onset psychological distress. Using `` 0 '' as a reference , the adjusted odds ratios ( 95 % confidence interval) were 1.65 ( 0.92-2.95) in `` 1 '' and 2.12 ( 1.24-3.64) in '' ≥ 2 '' ( P for trend = .02). Musculoskeletal pain is associated with new-onset psychological distress among survivors of the Great East Japan Earthquake. ( Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2018; page 1 of 6).
