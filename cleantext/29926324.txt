  Studying the neural correlates of craving to smoke is of great importance to improve treatment outcomes in smoking addiction. According to previous studies , the critical roles of striatum<pathogen> and frontal brain regions had been revealed in addiction. However , few studies focused on the hub of brain regions in the 12 h abstinence induced craving in young smokers. Thirty-one young male smokers were enrolled in the present study. A within-subject experiment design was carried out to compare functional connectivity density between 12-h smoking abstinence and smoking satiety conditions during resting state in young adult smokers by using functional connectivity density mapping ( FCDM). Then , the functional connectivity density changes during smoking abstinence versus satiety were further used to examine correlations with abstinence-induced changes in subjective craving. We found young adult smokers in abstinence state ( vs satiety) had higher local functional connectivity density ( lFCD) and global functional connectivity density ( gFCD) in brain regions including striatal subregions ( i.e. , bilateral caudate and putamen) , frontal regions ( i.e. , anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC) and orbital frontal cortex ( OFC)) and bilateral insula. We also found higher lFCD during smoking abstinence ( vs satiety) in bilateral thalamus. Additionally , the lFCD changes of the left ACC , bilateral caudate and right OFC were positively correlated with the changes in craving induced by abstinence ( i.e. , abstinence minus satiety) in young adult smokers. The present findings improve the understanding of the effects of acute smoking abstinence on the hubs of brain gray matter in the abstinence-induces craving and may contribute new insights into the neural mechanism of abstinence-induced craving in young smokers in smoking addiction.
