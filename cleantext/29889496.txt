  For developing the industrially feasible Ni-rich layered oxide cathode with extended cycle life , it is necessary to mitigate both the mechanical degradation due to intergranular cracking between primary particles and gas generation from the reaction between the electrolyte and residual Li in the cathode. To simultaneously resolve these two issues , we herein propose a simple but novel method to reinforce the primary particles in LiNi
