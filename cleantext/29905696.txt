  Permanent gratings are recorded in planar-aligned dye-doped nematic liquid crystal cells under visible light illumination. By increasing the irradiation intensity and exposure time , several diffraction orders of the recorded gratings are obtained in the Raman-Nath diffraction regime. By applying a dynamic transverse shear on one of the confining plates of the cell , an enhancement of the diffraction efficiency is achieved , which follows the period of the grating. By microscope inspection under static displacement of the upper plate , surface gratings formed by the dye adsorption are revealed in both the front and rear windows of the cell , indicating that the diffraction amplification originates from a coherent superposition of the diffracted orders when the gratings are displaced half a period. The effect provides self-matched amplification of diffraction with a simple cell , a single photo-inscription stage , and elementary displacement steps.
