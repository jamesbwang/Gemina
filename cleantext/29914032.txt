  The Free and Cued Selective Reminding test ( FCSRT) was used to assess memory in 19 patients with prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies ( DLB) and 25 Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) patients. DLB scored better than AD in selective measures of the FCSRT: immediate total recall ( p = 0.01) and index of sensitivity of cueing ( p = 0.001) , while free delayed and total memory scores were similarly impaired. The index of sensitivity of cueing held a sensitivity of 76 % and specificity of 79 % in distinguishing DLB. FCSRT could help in disentangling hippocampal memory deficits from memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> due to ineffective recall strategies.
