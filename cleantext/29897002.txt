  To evaluate the relationship between abnormal early amplitude integrated electroencephalography ( EEG) and severe<symptom> lesions<symptom> in imaging tests performed during the neonatal period in very low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight infants. An amplitude-integrated EEG was performed in 70 patients with a mean birth weight of 1226 g during the first 48 hours of life. Severe<symptom> lesions<symptom> on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) or ultrasonography ( US) during the neonatal period were considered as adverse conditions. Variables were compared using the Ï‡ Adverse outcomes were observed in 6 patients. There was a significant relationship ( P < .001) between abnormal amplitude-integrated EEG background and severe<symptom> lesions<symptom> on MRI and US. Sensitivity and specificity were 100 % and 89 % , respectively. Early amplitude-integrated EEG with moderate/severe abnormalities in the background is associated with severe structural lesions<symptom> detected in imaging studies and should be considered as an auxiliary screening tool for the detection of neonatal brain lesions<symptom> in very low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight infants.
