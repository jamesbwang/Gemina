  Two novel periodic mesoporous organosilica materials were synthesized with a neutral phenylene-bridged ligand , 1,4-bis ( trimethoxysilylethyl) benzene , one of them using tetraethyl orthosilicate as additional silica source ( PMO-TMSEB-1 and PMO-TMSEB-2). A third material was also synthesized with 1,4-bis ( triethoxysilyl) benzene ligand ( PMO-TESB-1) which use has scarcely been reported. The three materials were evaluated as solid-phase extraction ( SPE) sorbents for the off-line extraction of a mixture of seven drugs of different nature ( duloxetine , terbutaline , econazole , propranolol , verapamil , metoprolol , and betaxolol) from water samples. Subsequent simultaneous enantiomeric analysis by CE , using sulfated-β-cyclodextrin ( 2 % w/v) dissolved in a 25 mM phosphate buffer ( pH 3.0) and a voltage of -20 kV ( negative polarity) was carried out. Enantiomeric resolutions ranging from 2.4 to 8.5 were obtained in an analysis time of 16 min. After optimization of SPE parameters , it was shown that using just 100 mg of PMO-TESB-1 as sorbent , a preconcentration factor of 400 with 200 mL solution was achieved , allowing recoveries between 80.5 and 103.1 % ( except for terbutaline) , with good repeatability ( % RSD = 2-8 % , n = 5). Analytical characteristics of the method were evaluated in terms of precision , linearity and accuracy with method quantitation limits between 5.6 and 21.9 μg/L. The developed method was applied to the analysis of spiked wastewater samples collected in different treatment plants , with recoveries between 73.9 and 102.9 % except for econazole with recovery values ranging between 58.5 and 72.4 %.
