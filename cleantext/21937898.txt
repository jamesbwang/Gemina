  This study examined how supine-to-stand ( STS) performance is related to process and product assessment of motor competence ( MC) in children. Ninety-one children aged 5 ‚Åª 9 years were assessed for process and product MC ( 10 m running speed and standing long jump) as well as process and product measures of STS. Tertiles were created for STS process and STS product scores to create 3 groups reflecting low , medium , and high STS competency. ANCOVA analysis , controlling for age , for process STS , indicated that process MC was significantly higher in children , classified as medium STS ( p = 0.048) and high STS ( p = 0.011) competence , and that 10 m run speed was slower for low STS compared to medium ( p = 0.019) and high STS ( p = 0.004). For product STS tertiles , process MC was significantly higher for children in the lowest ( fastest) STS tertile compared to those in the medium highest ( slowest) tertile ( p = 0.01).
