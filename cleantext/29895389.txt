  To examine whether incorporating magnetic resonance elastography ( MRE) with contrast-enhanced computed tomography ( CE-CT) or dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI) can provide a benefit in differentiating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC) from inflammatory mass ( IM). Thirty patients with IM and 56 patients with PDAC confirmed by histopathology were identified retrospectively via a prospectively maintained database. All patients underwent CE-CT or DCE-MRI together with dual-frequency MRE at 40 and 60 Hz. A five-point scale for likelihood of pancreatic malignancy was used by two experienced radiologists in consensus. Diagnostic accuracy of CE-CT/DCE-MRI , MRE , and their combination ( modeled by logistic regression analysis) was estimated using receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) analysis with a leave-one-out cross validation. Accuracies for determination of PDAC by 60-Hz MRE , 40-Hz MRE , CE-CT/DCE-MRI , and the combination of CE-CT or DCE-MRI and 60- and 40-Hz MRE , were 70.2 % , 77.4 % , 83.3 % , 75 % , and 92.9 % , respectively. CE-CT or DCE-MRI combined with 40-Hz MRE significantly improved diagnostic performance versus CE-CT or DCE-MRI alone ( area under the ROC curve ( AUC): 0.937 versus 0.783 , p < 0.01) by increasing specificity ( 96.9 % versus 62.1 % , p = 0.002) without a significant loss of sensitivity ( 90.9 % versus 94.6 % , p = 0.727) , while combined CE-CT or DCE-MRI with 60-Hz MRE did not significantly change diagnostic performance versus CE-CT/DCE-MRI alone ( AUC: 0.760 versus 0.783 , p = 0.697). Combined assessment by 40-Hz MRE with CE-CT/DCE-MRI may help to differentiate PDAC from IM in a relatively non-invasive fashion.
