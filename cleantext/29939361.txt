  The concept of insight is used to indicate the propensity of patients with schizophrenia and other severe mental disorders to recognize their illness and engage in treatment. Thus , insight may have notable consequences for the ill individual: Those who lack insight are at higher risk of nonadherence to treatments , negative clinical outcomes , and worse community functioning. Although insight is an intuitive concept , its essence remains difficult to capture. However , many rating scales are available to aid assessment , both for clinical and research purposes. Insight can not be reduced to a symptom , a psychological mechanism , or a neuropsychological function. It is likely to have dynamic relationships with all these dimensions and with responses to personal events and contextual factors. In particular , social consequences of mental illness and explanatory models that are alternative to the medical model may fundamentally shape insight and treatment choice. Moreover , the cultural or individual stigmatization of mental illness may turn the acquisition of insight into a painful event and increase the risk of depression<symptom> Clinicians need to carefully evaluate and promote insight through a personalized approach to aid patient process of care and personal growth.
