  Insect repellents are widely used to fend off nuisance mosquitoes and , more importantly , to reduce or eliminate mosquito bites in areas where viruses and other vector-borne diseases are circulating. Synthesized more than six decades ago , DEET is the most widely used insect repellent. Plant-derived compounds are used in a plethora of commercial formulations and natural recipes to repel mosquitoes. They are also used as fragrances. We analysed Bombshell Â® to identify the constituent ( s) eliciting a previously reported `` off- label '' repellence activity. The two major fragrance ingredients in Bombshell , i.e. , methyl dihydrojasmonate and lilial , demonstrated strong repellence against the southern house mosquito , Culex<pathogen> quinquefasciatus , in laboratory assays. Both compounds activated a previously identified DEET-sensitive odorant receptor , CquiOR136. These compounds were also major constituents of Ivanka Trump eau de parfum. The methyl dihydrojasmonate content was higher in the Ivanka Trump perfume than in Bombshell , the reverse being true for lilial. Both Bombshell and Ivanka Trump eaux de parfums retained activity for as long as 6 hours in laboratory assays. Although wearing these perfumes may repel nuisance mosquitoes , their use as `` off-label '' repellents against infected mosquitoes is not recommended.
