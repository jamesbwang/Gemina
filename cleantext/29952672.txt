  This study analyzed the effects of complex strength training on the explosive muscular performance of junior female handball players. Subjects were arbitrarily divided between an experimental group ( n = 14) and a control group ( n = 14). Training sessions and matches were performed together , but during the 10-week intervention , the experimental group replaced a part of the regular regimen by complex strength training. Measures assessed in both groups before and after the intervention included: running times over 5 , 10 , 20 and 30 m , change of direction tests ( T-half agility test and modified Illinois test) , repeated shuttle sprint ability and repeated changes of direction tests , jumping ( squat , counter-movement , counter-movement with aimed arms and five-jump tests) , static and dynamic balance<symptom> , back extensor strength and 1RM half-squat. The intervention yielded increases in sprint ( 10 m: 11.7 %) , change of direction performance ( T-half: 5.1 %; modified Illinois: 4.2 %) , jumping ( squat p < 0.01; 19 %; countermovement p < 0.01; 20.3 %; countermovement aimed arms p < 0.01; 19.3 %; 5-jump p < 0.05; 15.2 %) , and one of 4 repeated sprint scores ( best time , p < 0.05; 5.9 %). However , Repeated sprint T-test and balance<symptom> scores were unchanged. Complex srength training develops abilities important to handball performance.
