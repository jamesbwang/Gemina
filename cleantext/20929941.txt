  Increasing knowledge about alcohol-related harms , changing social norms , or encouraging drinking within safe unit levels often fails to change behaviour in young people. A novel intervention called ` OneTooMany ' was developed , which targets the short-term social , and potentially , embarrassing consequences of drinking alcohol. The aim of this paper was to explore its acceptability , and to determine any features that might influence its effectiveness as a means of reducing alcohol consumption. Participants were 23 young adults ( aged 18-30) currently studying at university ( Embarrassing experiences were a normalised part of drinking occasions , while some were actively avoided , others were celebrated. Humour served as a device to engage and interest participants , but could also diminish intervention messages. OneTooMany prompted reflections on many regrettable drinking experiences , but the participants did not see themselves as the target audience for this intervention. Interventions may benefit from focusing on some of the short term , embarrassing consequences of excessive alcohol consumption. Further research is needed to ensure that reflections on past behaviour are helpful in addressing future behaviour.
