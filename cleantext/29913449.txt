  Melatonin possesses many biological activities such as antioxidant and anti-aging. Cardiac progenitor cells ( CPCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for myocardial infarction ( MI). However , the low survival of transplanted CPCs in infarcted myocardium limits the successful use in treating MI. In the present study , we aimed to investigate if melatonin protects against oxidative stress-induced CPCs damage and enhances its therapeutic efficacy for MI. TUNEL assay and EdU assay were used to detect the effects of melatonin and miR-98 on H2O2-induced apoptosis and proliferation. MI model was used to evaluate the potential cardioprotective effects of melatonin and miR-98. Melatonin attenuated H2O2-induced the proliferation reduction and apoptosis of c-kit + CPCs in vitro , and CPCs which pretreated with melatonin significantly improved the functions of post-infarct hearts compared with CPCs alone in vivo. Melatonin was capable to inhibit the increase of miR-98 level by H2O2 in CPCs. The proliferation reduction and apoptosis of CPCs induced by H2O2 was aggravated by miR-98. In vivo , transplantation of CPCs with miR-98 silencing caused the more significant improvement of cardiac functions in MI than CPCs. MiR-98 targets at the signal transducer and activator of the transcription 3 ( STAT3) , and thus aggravated H2O2-induced the reduction of Bcl-2 protein. Pre-treatment with melatonin protects c-kit + CPCs against oxidative stress-induced damage via downregulation of miR-98 and thereby increasing STAT3 , representing a potentially new strategy to improve CPC-based therapy for MI.
