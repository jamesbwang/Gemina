  Exercise participation and activity levels are low in many older adults , and when paired with the multi-systemic effects of ageing , such as sarcopenia and decreased cardiovascular function , can result in a loss of functional independence. Voluntary exercise may not always be feasible for these individuals , highlighting a need for alternative therapies. There is a growing body of literature that recognises the positive effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES) on muscle strength , muscle mass and cardiorespiratory function in older adults. However , NMES suffers from poor clinical acceptability due to multiple barriers to its use , and poor patient engagement and adherence have been noted. Technology-based supports to exercise , such as biofeedback and ` gamification ' , have been effectively paired with a variety of rehabilitation interventions. This suggests that these supports could be promising additions to an NMES exercise system to reduce barriers to its use and maximise clinical outcomes.
