  The ubiquitin-related protein NEDD8 is conjugated and deconjugated to and from proteins in processes related to ubiquitin conjugation and deconjugation. Neddylation is a well-studied posttranslational modification of Cullin-RING E3 ligases ( CRLs). Biochemical and structural studies aiming at understanding the role of NEDD8 in CRL function have now resulted in a convincing model of how neddylation and deneddylation antagonistically regulate CRL stability , conformation , activity as well as degradation substrate receptor exchange. Studies of the Arabidopsis thaliana deneddylation-deficient den1 mutant led to the identification of many low abundant , non-Cullin NEDD8 conjugates. Examination of neddylated AUXIN RESISTANT1 ( AXR1) , a prominent neddylated protein in den1 , suggests , however , that AXR1 neddylation may be an auto-catalytic side-reaction of Cullin-targeted neddylation and that DEN1 may serve to antagonize non-productive , auto-neddylation from substrates to provide free NEDD8 for CRL regulation.
