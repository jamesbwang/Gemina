  The FIFA-Medical and Assessment Research Centre developed FIFA 11 + program as a warm-up program for soccer players. Although the FIFA 11 + program is a well-established warm-up protocol for injury prevention among soccer players , the program 's performance enhancement aspect is not frequently discussed in the literature. To investigate the effects of the FIFA 11 + training program on functional performance in amateur male soccer players. The study included 57 amateur male soccer players from Jamia Hamdard University , who were randomly placed in an experimental group ( n = 29) and a control group ( n = 28). The experimental group underwent the FIFA 11 + training program for 12 weeks ( five times per week) and the control group continued their regular training. The study adopted a pretest-posttest design. The outcome measurements included the following tests: vertical jump , 20-yard sprint run , Illinois agility run test test , and t-tests. Vertical jump and sprint speed were significantly improved in the FIFA 11 + program group compared to the control group ( p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference in agility parameters ( p > 0.05) was found between the groups. The results show that the FIFA 11 + program may improve the performance of young amateur soccer players. This study may serve as the foundation for further studies with larger participant numbers.
