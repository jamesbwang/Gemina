  The role of parent involvement in school readiness interventions is not well-understood. The Getting Ready for School ( GRS) intervention is a novel program that has both home and school components and aims to improve early literacy , math , and self-regulatory skills in preschool children from socioeconomically disadvantaged families. In this study , we first examined associations between family characteristics and different indices of parent involvement in the GRS intervention. We then examined associations between parent involvement and change in children 's school readiness skills over time. Participants were 133 preschool children attending Head Start and their parents who participated in the GRS intervention during the academic year 2014-2015. Parent involvement was operationalized as attendance to GRS events at the school , time spent at home doing GRS activities , and usage of digital program materials , which included a set of videos to support the implementation of parent-child activities at home. Although few family characteristics were significantly associated with parent involvement indices , there was a tendency for some markers of higher socioeconomic status to be linked with greater parent involvement. In addition , greater parent involvement in the GRS intervention was significantly associated with greater gains in children 's early literacy , math , and self-regulatory skills. These findings suggest that parent involvement in comprehensive early interventions could be beneficial in terms of improving school readiness for preschoolers from disadvantaged families.
