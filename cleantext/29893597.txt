  Biological differences between men and women are well known; however , literature-addressing knowledge about the influence of sex to specific and general performance in team handball is almost nonexistent. Consequently , the aim of the study was to assess and compare specific and general physical performance in male and female elite team handball players , to determine if the differences are consequential for general compared to specific physical performance characteristics and the relationship between general and specific physical performance. Twelve male and ten female elite team handball players performed a game based performance test , upper- und lower-body strength and power tests , a sprinting test , and an incremental treadmill-running test. Significant differences ( P < .05) between male and female players were found for peak oxygen uptake and total running time during the treadmill test , 30m sprinting time , leg extension strength , trunk and shoulder rotation torque , counter movement jump height as well as offense and defense time , ball velocity and jump height in the game based performance test. An interaction ( sex Ã— test) was found for time and oxygen uptake and except shoulder rotation torque and ball velocity in females , we found only a low relationship between specific and general physical performance. The results of the study revealed that male players are heavier , taller , faster , stronger , jump higher and have a better aerobic performance. However , female players performed relatively better in the team handball specific tests compared to the general tests. Our findings also suggest that female players should focus more on strength training.
