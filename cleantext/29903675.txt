  This study investigated the effect of hydraulic retention time ( HRT = 8 , 12 , 16 , and 24 h) on effluent dissolved organic nitrogen ( DON) , dissolved total nitrogen ( DTN) , and functional gene quantity/transcription in biochar packed reactors over a 125-day operation at 5 °C. The lowest effluent DON concentration ( 0.21 ± 0.14 mg/L) and DTN concentration ( 10.74 ± 0.41 mg/L) were in R
