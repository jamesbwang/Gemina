  Routine influenza<disease> and tetanus<disease> , diphtheria<disease> and acellular pertussis<disease> ( Tdap) vaccination of pregnant women to prevent poor maternal , fetal and neonatal outcomes is recommended practice; however , actual rates of influenza<disease> vaccine acceptance are typically well below the ( Healthy People 2020 , 2015) goal of 80 %. We sought to identify barriers to accepting either vaccination. From December 2014 to April 2015 women were given a questionnaire eliciting their experiences , attitudes and history of influenza<disease> and Tdap vaccination in pregnancy during their routine prenatal care appointments at a tertiary care center. Patient demographics were included in the questionnaire. A similar questionnaire was administered to prenatal care providers. Patient influenza<disease> and Tdap vaccination acceptance rates were compared and predictors of vaccine acceptance were analyzed with bivariate logistic regression. Out of the 400 patient questionnaires distributed , 338 ( 84.5 %) were completed and returned; 24 of 45 ( 53.3 %) provider questionnaires were returned. Vaccination acceptance rates were 70.7 % for the influenza<disease> vaccine and 76.3 % for the Tdap vaccine. The logistic regression model indicated that predictors of acceptance for either vaccine in pregnancy are patient attitude and previous vaccination history. Patient attitudes were more favorable towards Tdap than influenza<disease> vaccination. The combination of healthcare provider recommendation and educational materials was significantly predictive of both Tdap and influenza<disease> vaccine acceptance. The most common reasons given for declining the influenza<disease> vaccine were safety concerns; the most common reasons given for declining the Tdap vaccine were that patients did not think it was required again when they received the vaccine before pregnancy. Our study suggests that providers can improve Tdap and influenza<disease> vaccination acceptance in pregnancy by recommending the vaccination in combination with provision of educational materials on the vaccines.
