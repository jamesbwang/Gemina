  Protoheme ( hereafter referred to as heme) is an essential cellular cofactor and signaling molecule that is also potentially cytotoxic. To mitigate heme toxicity , heme synthesis and degradation are tightly coupled to heme utilization in order to limit the intracellular concentration of `` free '' heme. Such a model , however , would suggest that a readily accessible steady-state , bioavailable labile heme ( LH) pool is not required for supporting heme-dependent processes. Using the yeast
