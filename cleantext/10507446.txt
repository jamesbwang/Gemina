  We report a case of a 30-year-old lady who presented to the emergency department with a 1 day history of severe epigastric pain which radiated to the back. Focused history , physical exam findings , haematological and radiological investigations , including ultrasound scanning of the abdomen , supported the diagnosis of acute gallstone pancreatitis<disease> She was managed conservatively and underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy at a later date. Intraoperatively , there was noted to be a small nodule<disease> loosely adherent to the gallbladder serosa. Histology from this nodule<disease> revealed it to be a portion of anatomically normal liver parenchyma also referred to as ectopic liver tissue ( ELT). ELT is a rare developmental abnormality in which normally functioning liver tissue develops at an extra-hepatic site. ELT is known to have an increased risk of neoplastic transformation and so we believe it to be of clinical importance.
