  Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome<disease> ( aHUS) is a rare , genetic , life-threatening disease. The Global aHUS Registry collects real-world data on the natural history of the disease. Here we characterize end-stage renal disease ( ESRD)- free survival , the rate of thrombotic microangiopathy , organ involvement and the genetic background of 851 patients in the registry , prior to eculizumab treatment. A sex-specific difference was apparent according to age at initial disease onset as the ratio of males to females was 1.3:1 for childhood presentation and 1:2 for adult presentation. Complement Factor I and Membrane Cofactor Protein mutations were more common in patients with initial presentation as adults and children , respectively. Initial presentation in childhood significantly predicted ESRD risk ( adjusted hazard ratio 0.55 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.41-0.73) , whereas sex , race , family history of aHUS , and time from initial presentation to diagnosis , did not. Patients with a Complement Factor H mutation had reduced ESRD-free survival , whereas Membrane Cofactor Protein mutation was associated with longer ESRD-free survival. Additionally extrarenal organ manifestations occur in 19 % -38 % of patients within six months of initial disease presentation ( dependent on organ). Thus , our real-world results provide novel insights regarding phenotypic variables and genotypes on the clinical manifestation and progression of aHUS.
