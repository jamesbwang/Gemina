  Deferiprone ( 3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethyl-4 ( 1H)- pyridone , DFP) , which is a drug clinically used for removing heavy metals in vivo , was explored for its removal efficiency towards uranium. The reaction of uranyl nitrate hexahydrate with DFP at room temperature yielded the compound ( ( UO2) ( H2O) ( C7NO2H8) 2) Â· 4H2O ( 1) , which crystallizes from a mixed solution of methanol and water ( pH = 7.0). X-ray diffraction shows that the stable complexation of uranyl occurs from the coordination of two bidentate DFP ligands perpendicular to the O ( double bond , length as m-dash) U ( double bond , length as m-dash) O unit with a fifth coordinating oxygen atom coming from one water molecule , resulting in a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. The formation constants of uranyl and DFP complexes were measured and the species distribution diagram illustrates that UO2L2 ( 94.6 %) is the dominant uranyl-DFP complex in 0.1 M KCl solution at physiological pH = 7.4. The results from both crystallographic and potentiometric studies imply that the metal: ligand ratio is 1: 2. The effectiveness of using DFP to remove uranium was examined at the cellular level , and the results suggest that it can significantly reduce the cellular uptake and increase the cellular release of U ( vi) in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells ( NRK-52E).
