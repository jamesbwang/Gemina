  To evaluate the effects of topically and subconjunctivally administered sesamol on experimentally induced corneal neovascularization in rats. Fifty-six right eyes of 56 Wistar Albino rats were chemically cauterized to induce corneal neovascularization in this experimental and comparative study. The subjects were divided into eight groups: topical sesamol ( group 1) , subconjunctival sesamol ( group 2) , topical bevacizumab ( group 3) , subconjunctival bevacizumab ( group 4) , topical bevacizumab + sesamol ( group 5) , subconjunctival bevacizumab + sesamol ( group 6) , topical Tween 80 ( group 7) , and control ( group 8). The amount of subconjunctivally injected sesamol and bevacizumab was 1.25 mg each. Topical groups were administered 10 mg/mL drops twice daily. The control group was left untreated. To evaluate the degree of corneal neovascularization , digital photographs and corneal sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin and CD31 were used. When photographs of neovascularization areas were examined , all treatment groups showed statistically significant differences when compared with the control group ( P < 0.001). Topical sesamol was found to be more effective when compared with subconjunctival sesamol ( P = 0.003). Topical sesamol + bevacizumab was found to be more effective when compared with topical bevacizumab ( P = 0.018). The numbers of new corneal vessels were as follows: 12.28 ± 6.29 in group 1 , 36.85 ± 12.8 in group 2 , 18.85 ± 7.71 in group 3 , 16.85 ± 8.70 in group 4 , 19.57 ± 8.56 in group 5 , 22.57 ± 7.43 in group 6 , 45.00 ± 11.29 in group 7 , and 51.16 ± 5.91 in group 8 ( P < 0.001). The outcomes of this study suggest antiangiogenic effects of sesamol. The use of topical sesamol monotherapy or sesamol combined with bevacizumab may be options for the prevention of corneal neovascularization.
