  The development of portable and user-friendly sensing platforms is a hot topic in the field of analytical chemistry. Among others , electroanalytical approaches exhibit a high amenability for reaching this purpose , i.e. the commercial strips for diabetes care are an obvious success. However , providing fully-integrated and user-friendly methods is the leitmotiv. In this work we evaluate the use of a disposable pipette tip , opportunely configured , to realize the first example of lab-on-a-tip. The combination of a pipette tip , wire electrodes , and cotton wool filter , highlights the suitability of producing a novel one-shot electroanalytical platform that does not require expertise-required tasks. To demonstrate the feasibility of this novel method , copper ( Cu
