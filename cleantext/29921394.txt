  Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> can utilize a wide range of carbon sources; however , in the presence of glucose the use of alternate carbon sources would be repressed. Several genes involved in the metabolic pathways exert these effects. Among them , the zinc finger protein , Mig1 ( multicopy inhibitor of GAL gene expression) plays important roles in glucose repression of Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> To investigate whether the alleviation of glucose effect would result in a switch to oxidative production pathway , MIG1 were disrupted in a haploid laboratory strain ( 2805) of S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen>. The impact of this disruption was studied under fully aerobic conditions when glucose was the sole carbon source. Our results showed that glucose repression was partly alleviated; i.e. , ethanol , as a significant fermentation marker , and acetate productions were respectively decreased by 14.13 % and 43.71 % compared to the wild type. In Î”MIG1 strain , the metabolic shifting on the aerobic pathway and a significant increase in pyruvate and glycerol production suggested it as an optimally productive industrial yeast strain. However , further studies are needed to confirm these findings.
