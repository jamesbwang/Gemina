  This cadaveric study was designed to analyze the safety of endoscopic repair of distal biceps tendon ( DBT) tears using 2 reattachment techniques. We evaluated the proximity of neurovascular structures to endoscopy portals; iatrogenic injury to neurovascular , musculotendinous , and osseous structures; and changes in compartment pressures. We hypothesized that an all-endoscopic repair of the ruptured DBT would be technically safe and the risk of iatrogenic injury would be low. A 2-portal endoscopic tendon repair was performed in 28 fresh-frozen cadaveric elbows with button devices ( with or without interference screws) ( n = 17) and suture anchors ( n = 11). Dissection was performed , and neurovascular , musculotendinous , and osseous structures were assessed for iatrogenic injury. The repair construct ( tendon-tuberosity contact area and implant placement site) was evaluated , and compartment pressures were measured. Statistical analysis was performed to determine significant differences in iatrogenic injury , compartment pressure changes , and tendon-bone contact area between different devices. The lateral cutaneous nerve , cephalic vein , and radial artery were in close proximity to the portals. The button group showed a significantly higher number of iatrogenic injuries than the anchor group ( P = .036). All-suture anchor repair showed a significantly higher contact area ( mean , 85 mm Endoscopic DBT repair was technically feasible with both fixation techniques. Button devices were associated with a significantly higher number of iatrogenic injuries. Endoscopic repair with dual suture anchors was safe in cadavers; however , further clinical results are necessary to establish the clinical safety of this technique.
