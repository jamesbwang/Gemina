  A study on fluorescence quenching was carried out for the coumarin derivative 2-acetyl-3H-benzo ( f) chromen-3-one ( 2AHBC) with aniline at room temperature. Efficient fluorescence quenching was observed and Stern-Volmer ( S-V) plots showed upward curves from linearity in all solvents of different polarities. For the solute 2AHBC , ground state complex formation does not hold in our study. The kinetic distance ( r) value was found to be greater than the encounter distance ( R) and indicated that the quenching reaction was held within the sphere of action. Diffusion-limited reactions were found to be more prominent in high polarity solvents , namely dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO) , DMF , ACN , methanol , ethanol , propanol and DCM. The relationships between quenching constant ( K
