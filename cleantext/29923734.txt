  Here we report on the fabrication of reconfigurable and solution processable nanoscale biosensors with multisensing capability , based on single-walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs). Distinct DNA-wrapped ( hence water-soluble) CNTs were immobilized from solution onto different prepatterned electrodes on the same chip , via a low-cost dielectrophoresis ( DEP) methodology. The CNTs were functionalized with specific , and different , aptamer sequences that were employed as selective recognition elements for biomarkers indicative of stress and neuro-trauma conditions. Multiplexed detection of three different biomarkers was successfully performed , and real-time detection was achieved in serum down to physiologically relevant concentrations of 50 nM , 10 nM , and 500 pM for cortisol , dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate ( DHEAS) , and neuropeptide Y ( NPY) , respectively. Additionally , the fabricated nanoscale devices were shown to be reconfigurable and reusable via a simple cleaning procedure. The general applicability of the strategy presented , and the facile device fabrication from aqueous solution , hold great potential for the development of the next generation of low power consumption portable diagnostic assays for the simultaneous monitoring of different health parameters.
