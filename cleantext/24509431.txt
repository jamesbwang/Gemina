  Studies have shown that olfactory-mediated behaviors that are critical to survival can be disrupted by exposure to certain metals. Polluted waterways often contain elevated levels of metals , yet only a subset have been characterized for their potential to cause olfactory toxicity. A larval zebrafish behavioral assay was developed to characterize concentration-response curves for zinc ( Zn) , hexavalent chromium ( Cr) , and arsenate ( As) olfaction inhibition. Cadmium ( Cd) , an established olfactory toxicant , was used as a positive control. As expected , following a 24-hour exposure to Cd , we observed a reduced response to taurocholic acid ( TCA) , a substrate for ciliated olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs) , thus validating the behavioral assay. Zn exposure similarly decreased the olfactory response toward TCA , ( IC
