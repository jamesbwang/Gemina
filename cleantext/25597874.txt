  In Korean cattle , intramuscular fat ( IMF) , or marbling , of the longissimus dorsi muscle ( LM) cross section is one of the most important indicators of beef quality and are influenced by environmental and genetic factors. This study was to evaluate the effect of SNPs on the beef quality in Korean cattle for functional studies , such as site-directed mutagenesis based on bovine adipocytes. The fatty acid synthase ( FASN) gene plays an important role in lipogenesis. FASN is an essential metabolic and multifunctional enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. Several studies have reported that SNPs g. 841G , g. 16024A , g. 16039T , and g. 17924G have a significant impact on marbling scores in Korean cattle and Japanese Black cattle population. These SNPs are located in transcription factor binding sites , the beta-ketoacyl reductase , and thioesterase domains. Our results revealed that the g. 17924 A > G SNP is located in the thioesterase domain of the FASN protein , and changes from polar , neutral , and hydrophilic to nonpolar , aliphatic , and hydrophobic , respectively. In in vivo LM tissue of Korean cattle , the g. 17924A > G SNP has an effect on increasing fat deposition. Therefore , g. 17924A > G SNP could be a causal mutation for increasing fat deposition in Korean cattle LM tissue.
