  Fluorescence spectrometry , combined with principle component analysis , partial least-squares regression ( PLSR) and artificial neural network ( ANN) , was applied for the analysis of Maltese extra virgin olive oil ( EVOO) adulterated by blending with vegetable oil ( corn oil , soybean oil , linseed oil , or sunflower oil). The novel results showed that adjusted PLSR models based on synchronised spectra for detecting the % amount of EVOO in vegetable oil blends had a lower root mean square error ( 0.02-6.27 %) and higher R
