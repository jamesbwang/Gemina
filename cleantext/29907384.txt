  The 39-item Parkinson 's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire ( PDQ-39) is the most widely used self-administered questionnaire assessing the quality of life of Parkinson 's disease ( PD) patients. We translated the PDQ-39 into the Filipino language as the Philippine-PDQ-39 ( P-PDQ-39) and used it to assess the quality of life of Filipino patients with PD. The original PDQ-39 was translated into Filipino using forward and backward translation by independent bilingual translators and used among 100 consecutively sampled PD patients. Baseline demographic data , disease duration and levodopa equivalent dose were collected. Internal consistency was measured using Chronbach 's Î±. The following rating scales and questionnaires were correlated with P-PDQ-39 through Pearson 's correlation coefficient to assess construct validity: modified Hoehn & Yahr Stage , Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale-Pilipino ( HADS-P) , Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS) Parts I-III , and Non-motor symptom Assessment Scale for Parkinson 's Disease ( NMSS). The mobility and activities of daily living domains of the P-PDQ-39 were well correlated with the Hoehn & Yahr stage of the patients and the UPDRS II and III scores emphasizing the value of motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom> in quality of life. Non motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom> in PD were also important determinants of quality of life as demonstrated in the correlation of HADS-P and NMSS Total scores with the P-PDQ 39 domains. The P-PDQ-39 is a valid assessment tool for assessing the quality of life of Filipino-speaking PD patients.
