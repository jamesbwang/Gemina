  Arrhythmia is a cardiac conduction disorder characterized by irregular heartbeats. Abnormalities in the conduction system can manifest in the electrocardiographic ( ECG) signal. However , it can be challenging and time-consuming to visually assess the ECG signals due to the very low amplitudes. Implementing an automated system in the clinical setting can potentially help expedite diagnosis of arrhythmia , and improve the accuracies. In this paper , we propose an automated system using a combination of convolutional neural network ( CNN) and long short-term memory ( LSTM) for diagnosis of normal sinus rhythm , left bundle branch block ( LBBB) , right bundle branch block ( RBBB) , atrial premature beats ( APB) and premature ventricular contraction ( PVC) on ECG signals. The novelty of this work is that we used ECG segments of variable length from the MIT-BIT arrhythmia physio bank database. The proposed system demonstrated high classification performance in the handling of variable-length data , achieving an accuracy of 98.10 % , sensitivity of 97.50 % and specificity of 98.70 % using ten-fold cross validation strategy. Our proposed model can aid clinicians to detect common arrhythmias accurately on routine screening ECG.
