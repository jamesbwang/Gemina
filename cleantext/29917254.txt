  In this study , we evaluated the relationship between haemodialysis ( HD) duration and erectile function status and gonadal hormones serum levels in adult men with end-stage renal disease ( ESRD). A total of 118 men with ESRD on chronic HD were eligible for analysis. The erectile dysfunction ( ED) was defined and graded according to the international index of erectile function ( IIEF-5) score. The serum levels of follicle stimulating hormones ( FSH) , luteinising hormone ( LH) , testosterone ( TST) , prolactin ( PRL) and estradiol ( E2) were measured using the standard laboratory technique. The mean age was 48.97 ± 14.68 years and mean duration of HD was 4.58 ± 3.03 years. The overall prevalence of ED was 78.8 %; from them 31.2 % had severe grade. The prevalence of ED was comparable in HD duration categories ( ≤ 5 years ( 79.7 %) , 5-10 years ( 76.5 %) , > 10 years ( 80.0 %); p > 0.05). The percentage of abnormal serum levels of FSH , LH , TST , PRL , E2 were 5.1 % , 1.6 % , 18.6 % , 90.7 % and 0.0 % respectively. No significant relationships were observed between HD duration and IIEF-5 score or gonadal hormones serum levels ( p < 0.05). We concluded that HD duration has no effect on erectile function status and gonadal hormones serum levels. Other factors may be relevant to these conditions in this particular group of patients.
