  ( Purpose) This study attempted to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the Falls Efficacy Scale ( FES) and the Activities-Specific Balance<symptom> Confidence Scale ( ABC) for community residents with hemiplegic stroke. ( Subjects and Methods) The FES and the ABC data were collected for a sample of 99 community-dwelling hemiplegic stroke patients in Korea. The Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC) curve was used to determine the cut-off values , and the area under the curve ( AUC) was used to assess the overall accuracy of each balance<symptom> test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to identify the predictors of falling. ( Results) The cut-off value was 63.75 in the ABC and 66.50 in the FES. The sensitivity and specificity of the ABC was 41.3 % and 92.0 % , respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the FES was 69.8 % and 63.9 % , respectively. The AUC was 0.691 for the ABC and 0.678 for the FES. The ABC explained 28.0 % of the variance in the experience of falls. ( Conclusion) The ABC has the ability to determine non-fallers , and it was a good explanatory factor of experience of falls.
