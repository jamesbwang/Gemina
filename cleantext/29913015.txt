  Although opioids are used to treat neonatal abstinence syndrome<disease> ( NAS) , the best pharmacologic treatment has not been established. To compare the safety and efficacy of methadone and morphine in NAS. In this randomized , double-blind , intention-to-treat trial , term infants from 8 US newborn units whose mothers received buprenorphine , methadone , or opioids for pain control during pregnancy were eligible. A total of 117 infants were randomized to receive methadone or morphine from February 9 , 2014 , to March 6 , 2017. Mothers who declined randomization could consent to data collection and standard institutional treatment. Infants were assessed with the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System every 4 hours and treated with methadone or placebo every 4 hours or morphine every 4 hours. Infants with persistently elevated Finnegan scores received dose increases. Infants who exceeded a predetermined opioid dose received phenobarbital. Dose reductions occurred every 12 to 48 hours when signs of NAS were controlled with therapy , stopping at 20 % of the original dose. The primary end point was length of hospital stay ( LOS). The secondary end points were LOS attributable to NAS and length of drug treatment ( LOT). A total of 183 mothers consented to have their infants in the study; 117 infants required treatment. Because 1 parent withdrew consent , data were analyzed on 116 infants ( mean ( SD) gestational age , 39.1 ( 1.1) weeks; mean ( SD) birth weight , 3157 ( 486) g; 58 ( 50 %) male). Demographic variables and risk factors were similar except for more prenatal cigarette exposure in infants who received methadone. Adjusting for study site and maternal opioid type , methadone was associated with decreased mean number of days for LOS by 14 % ( relative number of days , 0.86; 95 % CI , 0.74-1.00; P = .046) , corresponding to a difference of 2.9 days; 14 % reduction in LOS attributable to NAS ( relative number of days , 0.86; 95 % CI , 0.77-0.96; P = .01) , corresponding to a difference of 2.7 days; and 16 % reduction in LOT ( relative number of days , 0.84; 95 % CI , 0.73-0.97; P = .02) , corresponding to a difference of 2.3 days. Methadone was also associated with reduced median LOS ( 16 vs 20 days , P = .005) , LOS attributable to NAS ( 16 vs 19 days , P = .005) , and LOT ( 11.5 vs 15 days , P = .009). Study infants had better short-term outcomes than 170 nonrandomized infants treated with morphine per standard institutional protocols. With use of weight- and sign-based treatment for NAS , short-term outcomes were better in infants receiving methadone compared with morphine. Assessment of longer-term outcomes is ongoing.
