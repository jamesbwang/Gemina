  Farming has been exempted from most labor regulations and shielded from regulatory scrutiny by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA). Yet , agriculture and dairy in particular , has relatively high injury and fatality rates. A recent shift in OSHA 's approach to agricultural worker safety and health includes two dairy-focused Local Emphasis Programs ( LEPs) , one launched in Wisconsin in 2011 and the other in New<pathogen> York in 2014. We examine data from LEP-related , OSHA consultations and inspections as well as non-governmental audit programs , and review farmer perceptions about the LEP. Inspections conducted by OSHA and private consultation programs highlight the presence and variety of hazards on dairy farms in Wisconsin and New<pathogen> York. The LEPs helped raise dairy producers ' awareness of inherent hazards and methods to correct them. Farmers cited the LEP as beneficial , identifying it as a catalyst to reduce hazards on their farms.
