  To date , there have been many publications concerning relationship of meteorological condition and stroke onset. However , little is known about detailed meteorological factors that affect stroke onset. With hospital characteristics that most inpatients at our institution lived around Komaki , we examined the relationship between stroke onset and meteorological factors based on detailed meteorological data of Komaki. Between April 1 , 2012 and March 31 , 2015 , 1351 stroke patients admitted to Komaki City Hospital were enrolled in this study. These patients were classified into hypertensive intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH) , subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( SAH) , and cerebral infarction ( CI). Meteorological conditions such as season , weather , temperature , atmospheric pressure , and humidity were evaluated as factors that affect stroke onset. The incidence of ICH was lower in summer , and the minimum daily temperature was significantly related to ICH onset. The incidence of SAH was significantly related to the temperature difference compared to that on the previous day. When the mean temperature was lower than that on the previous day , the incidence of SAH was higher. No meteorological factor was found to affected the incidence of CI in this study. This study indicated that seasons and temperatures affect stroke onset.
