  To assess the expression of cathepsins in pancreatic samples obtained by endoscopic ultrasonography and fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA) and to investigate their relationship with the staging of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC). We prospectively included patients with solid pancreatic masses , in which EUS-FNA were performed. Cathepsins B , L , S and H expression was determined in FNA samples. Seventeen FNA were performed. All cytological material was from PDAC. Expression of cathepsins was predominantly low ( B 65 % , L 23 % , S 76 % , and H 41 %). We found no correlation between the expression levels and the extension of the neoplasm. Expression of cathepsins in the cytological material of PDAC is diverse but still poor to be useful in the pre-operative diagnosis. There is no correlation between the expression levels of cathepsins and the extension of the PDAC.
