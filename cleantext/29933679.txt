  This study attempts to establish a method for the anti-thrombin activty bioassay of musk , explore the impact of species and producing areas on the anti-thrombin activty of musk , and provide scientific basis for its biological quality evaluation. Anti-thrombin activty of musk was analyzed by thrombin titration , and the influence factors such as musk solution concentration , fibrinogen concentration , thrombin concentration and titration interval were optimized to evaluate the effect of different species and producing areas on anti-thrombin activty of musk. As a result , there was a good linear relationship between musk solution concentration and thrombin consumption volume within the range of 0.01-0.02 g · mL ⁻¹ (
