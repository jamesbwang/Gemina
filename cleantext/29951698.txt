  The Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> RsaL is a negative regulator of the quorum sensing signal synthesis gene lasI. The expression of RsaL is directly activated by the LasI cognate regulator LasR. Thus , RsaL and LasI-LasR ( LasI/R) form a regulatory loop. Further studies revealed that RsaL is a global regulator which controls the expression of numerous genes through quorum sensing system dependent and independent pathways. However , whether RsaL is involved in antibiotic tolerance remains elusive. In this study , we found that the mutation of rsaL increased bacterial tolerance to ciprofloxacin and carbenicillin. Through motif search , gene expression analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we found that RsaL directly represses the expression of the narK1K2GHJI operon , which is involved in the tolerance to ciprofloxacin. We further demonstrated that the narK1K2GHJI operon is directly regulated by LasR. In combination , our study revealed a novel operon under the control of the RsaL , LasI/R regulatory loop.
