  To explore the role of the interaction between glycogen synthase kinase-3β ( GSK-3β) and endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ERS) in the high glucose ( HG)- induced injury in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs). HUVECs treated with 40 mmol/L glucose for 24 h were examined for expression levels of GSK-3β , GRP78 , CHOP and cleaved caspase-3 protein using Western blotting. The cell viability was examined using CCK-8 assay and cell apoptosis was detected with Hoechst 33258 nuclear staining and photofluorography. The intracellular level of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) was measured with dichlorfluoresein staining and photofluorography. Mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP) was tested by rhodamine 123 ( Rh123) staining and photofluorography. Treatment of HUVECs with 40 µmol/L glucose for 3-24 h activated GSK-3β in a time-dependent manner , leading to significantly down-regulated expression of phosphorylated ( p)- GSK-3β ( P < 0.05). HG exposure of the cells for 1-24 h induced ERS , evidenced by time-dependently up-regulated expression of GRP78 and CHOP ( P < 0.05). LiCl , an inhibitor of GSK-3β , attenuated HG-induced ERS and significantly lowered the expression levels of GRP78 and CHOP ( P < 0.01). 4-PBA , an inhibitor of ERS , obviously ameliorated the activation of GSK-3β by HG as shown by the increase in p-GSK-3β expression level ( P < 0.01). HG exposure for 24 h induced obvious injuries in HUVECs , which exhibited decreased cell viability , increased cell apoptosis , increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 and ROS generation , and loss of MMP. Pretreatment of the cells with LiCl or 4-PBA for 60 min before HG exposure significantly lessened the cell injuries ( P < 0.01). Interactions between GSK-3β and ERS occur in HUVECs exposed to HG and participate in HG-induced cell injuries.
