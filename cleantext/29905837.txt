  Genome replication , transcription and repair require the assembly/disassembly of the nucleosome. Histone chaperones are regulators of this process by preventing formation of non-nucleosomal histone-DNA complexes. Aprataxin and polynucleotide kinase like factor ( APLF) is a non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ) DNA repair factor that possesses histone chaperone activity in its acidic domain ( APLFAD). Here , we studied the molecular basis of this activity using biochemical and structural methods. We find that APLFAD is intrinsically disordered and binds histone complexes ( H3-H4) 2 and H2A-H2B specifically and with high affinity. APLFAD prevents unspecific complex formation between H2A-H2B and DNA in a chaperone assay , establishing for the first time its specific histone chaperone function for H2A-H2B. On the basis of a series of nuclear magnetic resonance studies , supported by mutational analysis , we show that the APLFAD histone binding domain uses two aromatic side chains to anchor to the α1-α2 patches on both H2A and H2B , thereby covering most of their DNA-interaction surface. An additional binding site on both APLFAD and H2A-H2B may be involved in the handoff between APLF and DNA or other chaperones. Together , our data support the view that APLF provides not only a scaffold but also generic histone chaperone activity for the NHEJ-complex.
