  The abundance of oxidants and reductants must be balanced for an organism to thrive. Bacteria have evolved methods to prevent redox imbalances as well as mitigate their deleterious consequences through expression of detoxification enzymes , antioxidants , and systems to repair or degrade damaged proteins and DNA. Regulating these processes in response to redox changes requires sophisticated surveillance strategies , ranging from metal chelation to direct sensing of toxic reactive oxygen species. In the case of bacterial pathogens , stress that threatens to disrupt redox homeostasis can derive from endogenous sources ( produced by the bacteria) or exogenous sources ( produced by the host). This Minireview summarizes the sources of redox stress encountered during infection , the mechanisms by which bacterial pathogens diminish the damaging effects of redox stress , and the clever ways some organisms have evolved to thrive in the face of redox challenges during infection.
