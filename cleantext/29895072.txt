  Covered esophageal self-expandable metal stents ( SEMSs) are currently used for palliation of malignant dysphagia<symptom>. The optimal extent of the covering to prevent recurrent obstruction is unknown. Therefore , we aimed to compare fully covered ( FC) versus partially covered ( PC) SEMSs in patients with incurable malignant esophageal stenosis. In this multicenter randomized controlled trial , 98 incurable patients with dysphagia<symptom> caused by a malignant stricture of the esophagus or cardia were randomized 1:1 to an FC-SEMS or PC-SEMS. The primary outcome was recurrent obstruction after endoscopic SEMS placement. Secondary outcomes were technical and clinical success , adverse events , and health-related quality of life ( HRQoL). Patients were followed until 6 months after SEMS placement or to SEMS removal , second SEMS insertion , or death , whichever came first. Recurrent obstruction after SEMS placement was similar for both types of stents: 19 % for FC-SEMSs and 22 % for PC-SEMSs ( Esophageal FC-SEMSs did not reveal a lower recurrent obstruction rate compared with PC-SEMSs in the palliative management of malignant
