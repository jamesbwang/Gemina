  This study aimed to describe clinical outcomes in patients prescribed teriparatide and followed up for 18 months after stopping the drug in real-life conditions. The Extended Forsteo Â® Observational Study analysed incident clinical fractures in 6-month intervals using logistic regression with repeated measures. Changes in back pain ( visual analogue scale) and health-related quality of life ( HRQoL; EQ-5D questionnaire) were analysed using mixed models for repeated measures. Patients were analysed if they had a post-baseline visit , regardless of whether and for how long they took teriparatide. Of 1531 patients analysed ( 90.7 % female , mean age: 70.3 years) , 76 ( 5.0 %) never took teriparatide. Median treatment duration was 23.6 months. The adjusted odds of clinical fracture decreased by 47 % in the > 12- to 18-month treatment period ( p = 0.013) compared with the first 6-month period , with no statistically significant reduction in the > 18- to 24-month interval. The clinical fracture rate remained stable during the 18 months ' post-teriparatide , when approximately 98 % of patients took osteoporosis medication ( 51 % bisphosphonates). Clinical vertebral fractures were reduced at every time period compared with the first 6 months. Adjusted mean back pain scores decreased and EQ-5D scores increased significantly at each post-baseline observation. In a real-life clinical setting , the risk of clinical fractures declined during 24 months of teriparatide treatment. This reduction was maintained 18 months after stopping teriparatide. In parallel , patients reported significant improvements in back pain and HRQoL. The results should be interpreted in the context of the non-controlled design of this observational study.
