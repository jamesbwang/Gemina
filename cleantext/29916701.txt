  Utilizing natural antibodies to augment vaccine immunogenicity is a promising approach toward cancer immunotherapy. Anti-rhamnose ( anti-Rha) antibodies are some of the most common natural anti-carbohydrate antibodies present in human serum. Therefore , rhamnose can be utilized as a targeting moiety for a rhamnose-containing vaccine to prepare an effective vaccine formulation. It was shown previously that anti-Rha antibody generated in mice binds effectively with Rha-conjugated vaccine and is picked up by antigen presenting cells ( APCs) through stimulatory Fc receptors. This leads to the effective uptake and processing of antigen and eventually presentation by major histocompatibility complex ( MHC) molecules. In this article , we show that natural human anti-Rha antibodies can also be used in a similar mechanism and immunogenicity can be enhanced by targeting Rha-conjugated antigens. In doing so , we have purified human anti-Rha antibodies from human serum using a rhamnose affinity column. In vitro , human anti-Rha antibodies are shown to enhance the uptake of a model antigen , Rha-ovalbumin ( Rha-Ova) , by APCs. In vivo , they improved the priming of CD4 + T cells to Rha-Ova in comparison to non-anti-Rha human antibodies. Additionally , increased priming of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells toward the cancer antigen MUC1-Tn was observed in mice that received human anti-Rha antibodies prior to vaccination with a rhamnose-modified MUC1-Tn cancer vaccine. The vaccine conjugate contained Pam
