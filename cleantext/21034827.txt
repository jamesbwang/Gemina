  Human adult stem cells , including umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( hUCB-MSCs) , have recently been considered a promising alternative treatment for inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) due to their unique immunomodulatory properties and ability to promote tissue regeneration. However , despite many years of research and pre-clinical studies , results from clinical trials using these cells have been diverse and conflicting. This discrepancy is caused by several factors , such as poor engraftment , low survival rate , and donor-dependent variation of the cells. Enhancement of consistency and efficacy of MSCs remains a challenge for the feasibility of cell-based therapy. In this study , we investigated whether administration of MIS416 , a novel microparticle that activates NOD2 and TLR9 signaling , could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of hUCB-MSCs against Crohn 's disease , using dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS)- induced colitis<disease> model. Colitis<disease> was experimentally induced in mice by using 3 % DSS , and mice were administered a retro-orbital injection of MIS416 and subsequent intraperitoneal injection of hUCB-MSCs. Mice were examined grossly , and blood , spleen , and colon tissues were subsequently collected for further
