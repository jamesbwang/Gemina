  Caroli disease ( CD) is a congenital dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. In combination with liver fibrosis<disease> or cirrhosis , it is called Caroli syndrome<disease> ( CS). Infectious complications and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are secondary problems. The aim of this study was to analyse the clinical pattern and outcome in patients with CD/CS who underwent liver surgery. Between January 2004 and December 2016 , 21 patients with CD/CS were treated with liver resection or transplantation ( LTX) and post-operative data of patients with CD/CS were retrospectively analysed in a database. Two patients underwent LTX , and 19 patients underwent liver resection due to CD/CS. During follow-up , one patient developed lung cancer nine years after LTX. Patients resected due to CD/CS were predominantly females ( 74 %) with an overall low incidence of co-morbidities. The median post-operative Clavien-Dindo score was 1 ( range: 0-3). There was no death during a median follow-up period of over five years. In four patients , cholangiocarcinoma was confirmed. Tumor recurrence was seen in three patients , and was treated with chemotherapy or repeated liver resection. LTX and liver resections due to CD/CS are rare and associated with an acceptable post-operative morbidity and low mortality. Surgical treatment should be performed as early as possible to avoid recurrent episodes of cholangitis or carcinogenesis.
