  Bone mass in childhood is highly influenced by puberty. At the same age , bone mass was higher for pubertal than pre-pubertal children. A high level of tracking during 7 years from childhood through puberty was shown , indicating that early levels of bone mass may be important for later bone health. Bone mass development in childhood varies by sex and age , but also by pubertal stage. The objectives of this study were to ( 1) describe bone mass development in childhood as it relates to pubertal onset and to ( 2) determine the degree of tracking from childhood to adolescence. A longitudinal study with 7 years of follow-up was initiated in 2008 to include 831 children ( 407 boys) aged 8 to 17 years. Participants underwent whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA) scanning , blood collection to quantify luteinizing hormone levels , and Tanner stage self-assessment three times during the 7-year follow-up. Total body less head bone mineral content , areal bone mineral density , and bone area were used to describe development in bone accrual and to examine tracking over 7 years. Bone mass in pubertal children is higher than that of pre-pubertal children at the same age. Analysing tracking with quintiles of bone mass Z-scores in 2008 and 2015 showed that more than 80 % of participants remained in the same or neighbouring quintile over the study period. Tracking was confirmed by correlation coefficients between Z-scores at baseline and 7-year follow-up ( range , 0.80-0.84). Bone mass is highly influenced by pubertal onset , and pubertal stage should be considered when examining children 's bone health. Because bone mass indices track from childhood into puberty , children with low bone mass may be at risk of developing osteoporosis later in life.
