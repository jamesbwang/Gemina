  Elevated phosphoethanolamine ( PE) is frequently observed in MRS studies of human cancers and xenografts. The role of PE in cell survival and the molecular causes underlying this increase are , however , relatively underexplored. In this study , we investigated the roles of ethanolamine kinases ( Etnk-1 and 2) and choline kinases ( Chk-α and β) in contributing to increased PE in human breast and pancreatic cancer cells. We investigated the effect of silencing Etnk-1 and Etnk-2 on cell viability as a potential therapeutic strategy. Both breast and pancreatic cancer cells showed higher PE compared with their nonmalignant counterparts. We identified Etnk-1 as a major cause of the elevated PE levels in these cancer cells , with little or no contribution from Chk-α , Chk-β , or Etnk-2. The increase of PE observed in pancreatic cancer cells in culture was replicated in the corresponding tumor xenografts. Downregulation of Etnk-1 with siRNA resulted in cell cytotoxicity that correlated with PE levels in breast and pancreatic cancer cells. Etnk-1 may provide a potential therapeutic target in breast and pancreatic cancers.
