  Stress is associated with poor mental and physical health outcomes. In the United States ( U.S.) , little is known about perceived stress and associated factors among HIV-infected and immigrant women. Here , we examine these associations within a sample of 305 HIV-infected and uninfected , U.S.-born and non-U.S.-born women who were part of the Women 's Interagency HIV<pathogen> Study ( WIHS) at three sites ( New<pathogen> York , Chicago , and Los Angeles). Perceived stress was measured using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS-10); HIV<pathogen> infection was serologically confirmed , and nativity status was self-reported. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify associations with perceived stress. The majority of participants were U.S.-born ( 232 , 76.1 %) and were HIV-infected ( 212 , 68.5 %). Mutlivariable analyses found the odds of perceived stress to be lower for those employed ( adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) = 0.31 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = ( 0.15-0.63)) , with high levels of social support ( AOR = 0.45 , 95 % CI 0.26-0.79) , and HIV-infected ( AOR = 0.44 , 95 % CI 0.24-0.79). Perceived stress was positively associated with living in unstable housing ( AOR = 2.54 , 95 % CI 1.17-5.51). Here , immigration status was not associated with perceived stress. We identified stress to be higher among women who were unemployed , unstably housed , or who had low social support. Community-based programs should tailor interventions to include stress reduction strategies for participants with identified risk factors to improve mental and physical health outcomes.
