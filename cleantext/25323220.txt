  The occlusal registration of virtual models taken by intraoral scanners sometimes shows patterns which seem much different from the patients ' occlusion. Therefore , this study aims to evaluate the accuracy of virtual occlusion by comparing virtual occlusal contact area with actual occlusal contact area using a plaster model in vitro. Plaster dental models , 24 sets of Class I models and 20 sets of Class II models , were divided into a Molar , Premolar , and Anterior group. The occlusal contact areas calculated by the Prescale method and the virtual occlusion by scanning method were compared , and the ratio of the molar and incisor area were compared in order to find any particular tendencies. There was no significant difference between the Prescale results and the scanner results in both the molar and premolar groups ( p = 0.083 and 0.053 , respectively). On the other hand , there was a significant difference between the Prescale and the scanner results in the anterior group with the scanner results presenting overestimation of the occlusal contact points ( p < 0.05). In Molars group , the regression analysis shows that the two variables express linear correlation and has a linear equation with a slope of 0.917. R Difference between the actual and virtual occlusion revealed in the anterior portion , where overestimation was observed in the virtual model obtained from the scanning method. Nevertheless , molar and premolar areas showed relatively accurate occlusal contact area in the virtual model.
