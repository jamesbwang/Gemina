  Although lower household economic status is known to be a risk factor for obesity among school-age children , such an association among toddlers remains unclear. The present study investigated the association between household economic status and obesity in toddlers. We conducted a cross-sectional study of children aged 4 years attending daycare centers in Japan. Information on subjective household economic status ( `` affluent '' , `` neither '' , `` less affluent '' , or `` non-affluent '') was collected via questionnaire from the children 's guardians in 2015. Based on measured values of height and weight , obesity was defined using the International Obesity Task Force cut-offs of overweight ( BMI ≥ 17.47 for boys and ≥ 17.19 for girls). We used the logistic regression model to investigate the association between household economic status and obesity. Among 1,848 respondents , the prevalence of obesity was 6.8 %. Non-affluent household economic status was associated with a significantly higher probability of obesity in toddlers; the multivariate adjusted odds ratio for `` non-affluent '' households was 2.31 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.23-4.33) compared with `` affluent '' households. Perception of non-affluent economic status by the guardian was associated with a higher probability of toddler obesity. This result suggests that non-affluent household economic status is associated with obesity in toddlers.
