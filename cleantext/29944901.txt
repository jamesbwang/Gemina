  Nicotine addiction is the proximate cause of disease and death from cigarette smoking. In 1994 , we proposed reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes to non-addicting levels to reduce the risk of youth becoming addicted smokers and promoting quitting in established smokers. In 2009 , the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act provided the authority to FDA to reduce nicotine levels as appropriate to benefit public health. Over the past 15 years , considerable research has determined that nicotine reduction is feasible and safe , resulting in reduced nicotine dependence with little evidence of compensatory over-smoking. The availability of acceptable non-combusted form of nicotine would provide support and enhance acceptability of nicotine reduction in tobacco. Most recently , the FDA promulgated a nicotine-based regulatory framework , which includes nicotine reduction combined with ready availability of noncombustible nicotine products. Nicotine reduction could contribute to a virtual end to the use of cigarette smoking , with enormous benefits to public health.
