  A randomized phase III trial comparing watchful waiting with first-line rituximab for advanced stage follicular lymphoma commenced in Japan in December 2016. Watchful waiting is the current standard treatment for stages III and IV ( Ann Arbor classification) follicular lymphoma with low tumour burden. This study aimed to confirm the superiority of early administration of first-line rituximab in terms of event-free survival to watchful waiting for stages III and IV follicular lymphoma with low tumour burden. A total of 290 patients will be accrued from 50 Japanese institutions within 5 years. The primary endpoint is event-free survival defined as the period from registration to diagnosis of high tumour burden , therapy using cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy , or death. The secondary endpoints are overall survival , progression-free survival , cytotoxic chemotherapy/radiotherapy-free survival , histological transformation-free survival , response rate , adverse events and serious adverse events. This trial has been registered at the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry as UMIN000025187 ( http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index.htm).
