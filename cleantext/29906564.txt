  Extensively-drug-resistant bacteria ( XDRB) have emerged as a major source of resistance. Hospitalization abroad seems to be the major risk factor associated with carriage , and numerous reports have warned about the risk of in-hospital transmission. However , little is known regarding possible community transmission. A retrospective matched case-control study was conducted in a Parisian teaching hospital , which included patients admitted to hospital with a history of travel abroad over the preceding 12 months. Each XDRB carrier at admission ( case) was matched with two non-carriers ( controls) hospitalized in the same ward and admitted during the same month. To describe and identify risk factors associated with XDRB carriage at admission. Forty-six cases and 92 controls were enrolled. The results of univariate and multi-variate analyses showed that health repatriation was the only factor associated with a higher risk of carrying XDRB ( odds ratio 3.22 , 95 % confidence interval 1.23-7.84; P = 0.01). Surprisingly , one-third of the study population had not been hospitalized abroad within the preceding 12 months. The most frequently identified XDRB species were Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( 36 %) , Enterococcus<pathogen> spp. ( 17 %) and Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( 9 %) , and the most frequently identified enzyme was OXA-48 ( 36 %). In this retrospective study , health repatriation was the only risk factor for XDRB carriage identified at admission. Furthermore , the data suggest community-onset transmission. Therefore , there is an urgent need to conduct studies in high-risk countries to identify the risk factors associated with community carriage.
