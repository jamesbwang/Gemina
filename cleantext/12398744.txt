  Here we review the literature concerning measurement of the Andreev reflection between a superconductor ( S) and ferromagnet ( F) , with particular attention to the case where the ferromagnet is a transition metal oxide. We discuss the practicality of utilization of the current models for determination of the transport current spin polarization and examine the evidence for Andreev bound states.This article is part of the theme issue ` Andreev bound states '.
