  MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are widely expressed in organisms and are implicated in the regulation of most biological functions. The present study investigated the association of plasma miRNAs with the clinical outcomes of dual antiplatelet therapy in coronary artery disease ( CAD) patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). Plasma miRNA levels were screened using high-throughput Illumina sequencing to evaluate the antiplatelet efficacy of clopidogrel and aspirin. Six plasma miRNAs ( miR-126 , miR-130a , miR-27a , miR-106a , miR-21 , and miR-142) were associated with clopidogrel-treated platelet aggregation. These miRNAs were validated in a prospective cohort of 1230 CAD patients using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR). High plasma miR-142 levels were associated with a high risk of major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE) , with a hazard ratio ( 95 % confidence interval) of 1.83 ( 1.30-2.59) at a false discovery rate of < 5 %. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that diabetes mellitus , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , calcium channel blocker application , and a high plasma miR-142 level were independent risk factors of MACE. The levels of the six plasma miRNAs were not significantly associated with bleeding events during the 3-year follow-up. In conclusion , plasma miR-142 is potential marker to predict MACE in CAD patients after PCI.
