  The thymectomy specimens from the `` thymectomy trial in non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis patients receiving prednisone therapy '' ( MGTX) underwent rigid and comprehensive work-up , which permits analysis of the spatial distribution of histological and immunohistological features. This analysis revealed strong intra- and inter-case variability. While many histological features ( e.g. median percent fat content among different specimens) can easily be correlated with clinical parameters , intra-case spatial variability of histological features has yet defied quantification and statistical evaluation. To overcome this gap in digital pathology , we here propose intra-case entropy of measured histological features in all available slides of a given thymectomy specimen as a quantitative marker of spatial histological heterogeneity. Calculation of entropy led to one value per specimen and histological feature. Through these ` entropy values ' the so far neglected degree of spatial histological heterogeneity could be fed into statistical analyses , extending the scope of clinico-pathological correlations.
