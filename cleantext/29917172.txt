  The WHO Checklist for Safe Surgery has been in use in Swedish healthcare since 2009. Based on national and international experiences , we have developed the original checklist , with the aim to keep its strengths and remove the weaknesses<symptom>. The most obvious difference is that each section of the original checklist has been split into a pure checklist and corresponding instructions. It is now also more obvious that the basis for the checklist is local guidelines/routines. It is primarily via these local guidelines/routines that local adaptations can be made. The new checklist has been tested and gradually improved during six rounds at large and small Swedish hospitals , where comments from staff have been considered. The name has been changed to Checklist for Safe Surgery 2.0 , and distribution to all Swedish hospitals will commence in the early autumn of 2018.
