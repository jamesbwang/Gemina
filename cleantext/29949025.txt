  To devise an Italian version of the quick mild cognitive impairment screen ( Qmci) and to obtain normative data. An Italian version of the Qmci screen ( Qmci-I) was administered to 307 subjects free from cognitive impairment. The normative sample was divided into three age levels ( 50-59; 60-69 and 70-80 years) and four education levels ( 3-5; 6-8; 9-13; > 13 years of school attendance). Multiple regression analyses were used to evaluate the effect of age , sex and schooling on Qmci-I scores ( overall and by domains) and to calculate cut-off values , with reference to the confidence interval on the fifth centile. The mean Qmci-I score was 64/100 ( SD = 11). The age variable showed a significant negative effect on the overall Qmci-I score , with older people performing worse than younger ones. Conversely , education was associated with higher scores. Significant effects of age and education affected logical memory alone. For the other domains , the following effects were found: ( 1) higher age associated with lower scores on delayed recall; ( 2) higher education levels associated with higher scores on immediate recall , clock drawing and word fluency. The adjusted cut-off score for the Qmci-I screen in this sample was 49.4. Qmci-I scores were weakly correlated with those of MMSE ( rho = 0.20). The Qmci-I is a rapid and multi-domain short cognitive screening instrument useful for evaluating cognitive functions. However , like other screening tools , it is significantly influenced by age and education , requiring normative data and correction of values when used in the clinical practice.
