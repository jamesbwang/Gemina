  Limited information is available on the applicative value of liquid biopsy ( LB) in rare tumors , including Ewing 's sarcoma<disease> ( ES). The accepted precision diagnostics standards would greatly benefit from a non-invasive LB test monitoring pathognomonic gene rearrangements in the bloodstream. Tissue and blood samples were collected from six and four ES patients , respectively. Plasma was cleared by two successive rounds of centrifugation and stored frozen until RNA extraction by the QIAmp CNA kit. RNA was retro-transcribed and subjected to real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR) and digital polymerase chain reaction ( dPCR). Reactions were set up using two custom primer sets identifying types 1 and 2 The two prevalent types of To our knowledge , this is one of the few single-marker LB assays in solid tumors specifically designed to detect rearranged RNAs in blood , and the first study describing
