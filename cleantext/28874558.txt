  Human activities have been implicated in the observed increase in Global Mean Surface Temperature. Over regional scales where climatic changes determine societal impacts and drive adaptation related decisions , detection and attribution ( D&A) of climate change can be challenging due to the greater contribution of internal variability , greater uncertainty in regionally important forcings , greater errors in climate models , and larger observational uncertainty in many regions of the world. We examine the causes of annual and seasonal surface air temperature ( TAS) changes over sub-regions ( based on a demarcation of homogeneous temperature zones) of India using two observational datasets together with results from a multimodel archive of forced and unforced simulations. Our D&A analysis examines sensitivity of the results to a variety of optimal fingerprint methods and temporal-averaging choices. We can robustly attribute TAS changes over India between 1956-2005 to anthropogenic forcing mostly by greenhouse gases and partially offset by other anthropogenic forcings including aerosols and land use land cover change.
