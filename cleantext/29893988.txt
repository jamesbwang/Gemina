  Evidence to support the specific use of magnetic resonance tumour regression grade ( mrTRG) is inadequate. The aim of this study was to investigate the pathological characteristics of mrTRG after chemoradiotherapy ( CRT) for rectal cancer and the implications for surgery. Patients undergoing long-course CRT ( 45-50 Gy plus a booster dose of 4-6 Gy) for mid or low rectal cancer ( cT3-4 or cN + without metastasis) between 2011 and 2015 who had post-CRT rectal MRI before surgery were included retrospectively. Three board-certified experienced radiologists assessed mrTRG. mrTRG was correlated with pathological tumour regression grade ( pTRG) , ypT and ypN. In a subgroup of patients with mrTRG1-2 and no tumour spread ( such as nodal metastasis) on MRI , the projected rate of completion total mesorectal excision ( TME) if they underwent transanal excision ( TAE) and had a ypT status of ypT2 or higher was estimated , and recurrence-free survival was calculated according to the operation ( TME or TAE) that patients had actually received. Some 439 patients ( 290 men and 149 women of mean ( s.d.) age 62 · 2 ( 11 · 4) years) were analysed. The accuracy of mrTRG1 for predicting pTRG1 was 61 per cent ( 40 of 66) , and that for ypT1 or less was 74 per cent ( 49 of 66). For mrTRG2 , these values were 22 · 3 per cent ( 25 of 112) and 36 · 6 per cent ( 41 of 112) respectively. Patients with mrTRG1 and mrTRG2 without tumour spread were ypN + in 3 per cent ( 1 of 29) and 16 per cent ( 8 of 50) respectively. Assuming mrTRG1 or mrTRG1-2 with no tumour spread on post-CRT MRI as the criteria for TAE , the projected completion TME rate was 26 per cent ( 11 of 43) and 41 · 0 per cent ( 41 of 100) respectively. For the 100 patients with mrTRG1-2 and no tumour spread , recurrence-free survival did not differ significantly between TME ( 79 patients) and TAE ( 21) ( adjusted hazard ratio 1 · 86 , 95 per cent c.i. 0 · 42 to 8 · 18). Patients with mrTRG1 without tumour spread may be suitable for TAE.
