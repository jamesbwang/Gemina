  To investigate the effect of paravertebral dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine on independent lung injury during one-lung ventilation. In total , 120 patients who underwent elective radical resection of pulmonary carcinoma were randomly assigned to one of six groups ( n = 20): normal saline ( C group) , ropivacaine ( R group) , intravenous dexmedetomidine ( Div group) , 0.5 μg/kg paravertebral dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine ( RD0 .5 group) , 1.0 μg/kg paravertebral dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine ( RD1 .0 group) , or 2.0 μg/kg paravertebral dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine ( RD2 .0 group). Patients in the R , Div , RD0 .5 , RD1 .0 and RD2 .0 groups underwent a thoracic paravertebral block , and normal saline was administered as a control to C group. Small marginal lung samples next to the tumor were harvested immediately after the tumor tissues were excised. Lung injury was evaluated as follows: an injury score was determined via light microscopy , and cell apoptosis was determined via a TUNEL assay. TNF-α , IL-6 , miRNA-210 , HIF-1α , Tom20 and ISCU2 were also detected. Both intravenous and paravertebral dexmedetomidine attenuated independent lung injury. Downregulation of HIF-1α and miRNA-210 and upregulation of Tom20 and ISCU2 may be the underlying mechanism. No difference was observed between the Div and RD0 .5 groups , and no further improvement of lung injury was found in the RD1 .0 and RD2 .0 groups with increased paravertebral dexmedetomidine doses. Paravertebral dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine , which is comparable to intravenous dexmedetomidine , could protect against independent lung injury during one-lung ventilation.
