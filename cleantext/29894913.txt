  Cartilage-derived matrix ( CDM) has emerged as a promising scaffold material for tissue engineering of cartilage and bone due to its native chondroinductive capacity and its ability to support endochondral ossification. Because it consists of native tissue , CDM can undergo cellular remodeling , which can promote integration with host tissue and enables it to be degraded and replaced by neotissue over time. However , enzymatic degradation of decellularized tissues can occur unpredictably and may not allow sufficient time for mechanically competent tissue to form , especially in the harsh inflammatory environment of a diseased joint. The goal of the current study was to engineer cartilage and bone constructs with the ability to inhibit aberrant inflammatory processes caused by the cytokine interleukin-1 ( IL-1) , through scaffold-mediated delivery of lentiviral particles containing a doxycycline-inducible IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1Ra) transgene on anatomically-shaped CDM constructs. Additionally , scaffold-mediated lentiviral gene delivery was used to facilitate spatial organization of simultaneous chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation via site-specific transduction of a single mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC) population to overexpress either chondrogenic , transforming growth factor-beta 3 ( TGF-β3) , or osteogenic , bone morphogenetic protein-2 ( BMP-2) , transgenes. Controlled induction of IL-1Ra expression protected CDM hemispheres from inflammation-mediated degradation , and supported robust bone and cartilage tissue formation even in the presence of IL-1. In the absence of inflammatory stimuli , controlled cellular remodeling was exploited as a mechanism for fusing concentric CDM hemispheres overexpressing BMP-2 and TGF-β3 into a single bi-layered osteochondral construct. Our findings demonstrate that site-specific delivery of inducible and tunable transgenes confers spatial and temporal control over both CDM scaffold remodeling and neotissue composition. Furthermore , these constructs provide a microphysiological in vitro joint organoid model with site-specific , tunable , and inducible protein delivery systems for examining the spatiotemporal response to pro-anabolic and/or inflammatory signaling across the osteochondral interface.
