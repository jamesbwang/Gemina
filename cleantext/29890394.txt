  Simultaneous and point-of-care detection of multiple protein biomarkers has significant impact on patient care. Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA) , Cystic<disease> Fibrosis<disease> ( CF) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD) are well known progressive hereditary disorders associated with increased morbidity as well as mortality. Therefore , rapid detection of biomarkers specific for these three disorders in newborns offers new opportunities for early diagnosis , delaying symptoms and effective treatment. Here , we report the development of a disposable carbon nanofiber ( CNF)- based electrochemical immunosensor for simultaneous detection of survival motor neuron 1 ( SMN1) , cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR) and DMD proteins. The CNF-modified array electrodes were first functionalized by electroreduction of carboxyphenyl diazonium salt. Then , the immunosensor was fabricated by the covalent immobilization of the three antibodies on the working electrodes of the array sensor via carbodiimide ( EDC/NHS) chemistry. Simultaneous detection of CFTR , DMD and SMN1 was achieved with high sensitivity and detection limits of 0.9 pg/ml , 0.7 pg/ml and 0.74 pg/ml , respectively. The multiplexed immunosensor has also shown strong selectivity against non-specific proteins. Moreover , high recovery percentage was obtained when the immunosensor was applied in spiked whole blood samples. This voltammetric immunosensor offers cost effective , easy to use , rapid and high throughput potential screening method for these three hereditary disorders using only few drops of blood.
