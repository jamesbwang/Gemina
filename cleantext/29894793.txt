  Antibodies against the IL-5 pathway have been developed for the treatment of late-onset eosinophilic corticosteroid-resistant asthma. However , the prevalence of severe asthma and the proportion of patients who could benefit from such treatment among the general population of asthmatics remain unknown. To evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of patients eligible to anti-IL-5 treatment and severe asthma in an unselected cohort of adult-onset asthma. Seinäjoki Adult Asthma Study is a 12-year follow-up study of patients with new-onset adult asthma ( n = 203). Prevalence was estimated based on information collected at 12-year follow-up visit. Health care use was collected from the whole 12-year follow-up period. The prevalence of anti-IL-5-treatable patients was 2 % , when the following criteria were used: daily use of medium-to-high inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS) dose and long-acting β In a cohort of unselected consecutive patients with adult-onset asthma , 5.9 % fulfilled criteria for severe asthma and 2 % qualified for anti-IL-5 treatment. Both groups represent a high burden to health care and specifically targeted treatment could lead to lower use of health care at long term.
