  Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma<disease> ( FDCS) is an extremely rare malignant tumor caused by proliferation of antigen-presenting follicular dendritic cells. The tumor most commonly arises in lymph nodes , with fewer than 30 % of cases originating in extranodal sites. We report the case of a 39-year-old previously healthy male patient who presented with paraneoplastic pemphigus in the setting of a large intraperitoneal mass with no associated lymphadenopathy<disease> The biopsy results showed a cellular proliferation of mildly to moderately atypical oval-to-spindle-shaped cells admixed with a variably dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate suggestive of FDCS versus inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. A pathology review following total resection of the abdominal mass confirmed the diagnosis of FDCS. The tumor cells showed positivity for CD35 , CD21 , CD45 , and CD68 , negative ALK staining , and limited smooth muscle actin immunoreactivity. The surgery was complicated by severe pneumonia<disease> and acidosis , resulting in a prolonged ICU stay and death. It is essential to maintain a high index of suspicion for FDCS and include it in the differential diagnosis of a spindle cell neoplasm , especially in the setting of paraneoplastic pemphigus. The histological and immunohistochemical features should be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of FDCS.
