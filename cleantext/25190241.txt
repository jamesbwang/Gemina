  We sought to determine whether presence , amount and distribution of scar impacts the degree of acute hemodynamic response ( AHR) with multisite pacing.Multi-vein pacing ( MVP) or multipolar pacing ( MPP) with a multi-electrode left ventricular ( LV) lead may offer benefits over conventional biventricular pacing in patients with myocardial scar. In this multi-center study left bundle branch block patients underwent an hemodynamic pacing study measuring LV dP/dt 24 patients ( QRS 171 ± 20 ms) completed the study ( 83 % male). An ischemic etiology was present in 58 % and the mean scar volume was 6.0 ± 7.0 %. Overall discounting scar , MPP and MVP showed no significant AHR increase compared to an optimized `` best BiV '' ( BestBiV) site. In a minority of patients ( 6/24) receiver-operator characteristic analysis of scar volume ( cut off 8.48 %) predicted a small AHR improvement with MPP ( sensitivity 83 % , specificity 94 %) but not MVP. Patients with scar volume > 8.48 % had a MPP-BestBiV of 3 ± 6.3 % vs. -6.4 ± 7.7 % for those below the cutoff. There was a significant correlation between the difference in AHR and scar volume for MPP-BestBiV ( R = 0.49 , p = 0.02) but not MVP-BestBiV ( R = 0.111 , p = 0.62). The multielectrode lead positioned in scar predicted MPP AHR improvement ( p = 0.04). Multisite pacing with MPP and MVP shows no AHR benefit in all-comers compared to optimized BestBiV pacing. There was a minority of patients with significant scar volume in relation to the LV site that exhibited a small AHR improvement with MPP. ( Study identifier NCT01883141).
