  Denuders are gas-particle partitioning tools and can be used in combination with filters and adsorbers for phase-separated collection of hazardous semi-volatile organic compound ( SVOC) aerosols. Here , we investigated the suitability of carbonaceous monolithic multi-channel denuders for this approach. Particle transmission efficiency through the denuders was investigated using particles of polystyrene latex ( PSL) and droplets of n-hexadecane and diethylene glycol. The time-dependent vapour collection efficiency was analysed for n-hexadecane and diethylene glycol vapours and also compared to calculated predictions. Our measurements showed an averaged transmission efficiency of 97 ± 4.4 % for PSL particles with diameters of 0.51 , 0.99 , 1.93 , and 3.00 µm. Measurements with one denuder and 1.08 , 1.98 , and 2.97 µm particles consisting of n-hexadecane or diethylene glycol resulted in an averaged transmission efficiency of 99 ± 6.5 %. Regarding the vapour collection efficiency at a flow rate of 5 l min-1 , n-hexadecane vapour could be adsorbed to a similar extent ( 91 ± 1.4 % for one denuder , 98 ± 0.3 % for two denuders) as diethylene glycol vapour ( 93 ± 1.8 % for one denuder , 97 ± 0.9 % for two denuders). The comparison between experimental and theoretical vapour collection efficiencies revealed differences around 2.8 % for n-hexadecane and around 12.3 % for diethylene glycol. The results show that the tested denuders can be used as vapour collection tools for SVOCs , and can be integrated in currently used personal air samplers for separated vapour and particle collection.
