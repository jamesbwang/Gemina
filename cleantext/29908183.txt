  Ischemia and oxidative stress play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of sudden sensorineural hearing loss ( SSNHL). Macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and serves an important role in hearing function. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of MIF on oxygen-glucose deprivation ( OGD)- induced ototoxicity and to elucidate its molecular mechanism. In HEI-OC1 auditory cells , OGD reduced cell viability and increased supernatant lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) and MIF in a time-dependent manner. However , the reduced cell viability exerted by OGD was attenuated by antioxidant and MIF. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that MIF could activate NF-E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2) , and real-time PCR showed increased mRNA expressions of Nrf2 and two Nrf2-responsive genes , including heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1) and NAD ( P) H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 ( NQO1). MIF also suppressed oxidative stress induced by OGD , as demonstrated by decreased MDA and increased GSH in cellular supernatant. Inhibition of Nrf2 using siRNA suppressed HO-1 protein expression , the protective effect on OGD-induced injury and decrease in oxidative stress by MIF. Moreover , MIF prevented OGD-induced reduction of Akt1 phosphorylation at Ser473. LY294002 , an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt signaling , attenuated the enhancement of Nrf2 protein and protective effect of MIF in OGD-treated cochlear cells. We demonstrate that MIF protects cochlear cells against OGD-induced injury through activation of Akt-Nrf2-HO-1 pathway.
