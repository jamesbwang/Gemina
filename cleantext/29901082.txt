  Solar ultraviolet B ( UVB) radiation is known to trigger inflammation<symptom> , oxidative stress and apoptotic responses through various signaling pathways , which eventually lead to skin cancer. The present study investigated whether liquiritin suppresses UVB‑induced skin injury in vivo and in vitro using SKH‑1 hairless mice and HACAT cells , respectively. The animals were exposed to UVB irradiation ( 180 mJ/cm2) for 20 min , followed by liquiritin treatment. The findings indicated that UVB exposure resulted in the excessive release of pro‑inflammatory cytokines , including interleukin ( IL) 1β , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF) α , IL‑18 , IL‑6 and cyclooxygenase ( COX) 2 , which were dependent on the toll‑like receptor ( TLR) 4/myeloid differentiation factor 88 ( MyD88)/ nuclear factor‑κB ( NF‑κB) signaling pathway. Oxidative stress was also observed , evidenced by reduced antioxidants and elevated oxidants. Apoptosis , examined using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and crystal violet staining , suggested that UVB irradiation caused cell death in vivo and in vitro , which was closely associated with p38/c Jun N‑terminal kinase and caspase activity. Of note , liquiritin treatment in mice and cells exposed to UVB showed reduced inflammatory response , oxidative stress and apoptosis through inhibiting the activation of TLR4/MyD88/NF κB mitogen‑activated protein kinases and caspase pathways , and downregulating the release of oxidants. Overall , the data revealed that liquiritin may be a useful compound against UVB‑induced skin injury.
