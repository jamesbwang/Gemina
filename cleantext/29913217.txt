  Despite the immense importance of the wing in the evolution and successful radiation of the insect lineages , the origin of this critical structure remains a hotly-debated mystery. Two possible tissues have been identified as an evolutionary origin of wings; the lateral expansion of the dorsal body wall ( tergal edge) and structures related to an ancestral proximal leg segment ( pleural tissues). Through studying wing-related tissues in the red flour beetle , Tribolium castaneum , we have previously presented evidence in support of a dual origin of insect wings , a third hypothesis proposing that wings evolved from a combination of both tergal and pleural tissues. One key finding came from the investigation of a Cephalothorax ( Cx) mutant , in which the ectopic wing characteristic to this mutant was found to be formed from both tergal and pleural contributions. However , the degree of contribution of the two tissues to the wing remains elusive. Here , we took advantage of multiple Cx alleles available in Tribolium , and produced a variety of degrees and types of ectopic wing tissues in their prothoracic segments. Through detailed phenotypic scoring of the Cx phenotypes based on nine categories of mutant traits , along with comprehensive morphological analysis of the ectopic wing tissues , we found that ( i) ectopic wing tissues can be formed at various locations in the prothorax , even internally , ( ii) the lateral external ectopic wing tissues have tergal origin , while the internal and posterior external ectopic wing tissues appear to be of pleural origin , and ( iii) the ectopic wing tissues of both tergal and pleural origin are capable of transforming into wing surface tissues. Collectively , these outcomes suggest that the evolutionary contribution of each tissue to a complete wing may be more complex than the simple binary view that is typically invoked by a dual origin model ( i.e. the wing blade from the tergal contribution + musculature and articulation from the pleural contribution).
