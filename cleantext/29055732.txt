  To determine the efficacy and safety of glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate metered dose inhaler ( GFF MDI 36/9 .6 , 36/7 .2 , 18/9 .6 , 9/9 .6 µg) using innovative co-suspension delivery technology , compared with glycopyrrolate ( GP) MDI 36 µg and formoterol fumarate ( FF) MDI 9.6 µg , in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. In this Phase IIb , randomized , double-blind , balanced incomplete-block , two-period , cross-over study ( NCT01349816) , patients received treatment twice-daily for 7 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV All 185 randomized patients received treatment. All doses of GFF MDI significantly improved the primary endpoint compared with GP MDI 36 µg ( all While all doses of GFF MDI were superior to GP MDI 36 µg for the primary end-point , in this study neither superiority of GFF MDI to FF MDI 9.6 µg nor a clear dose-response was observed. All treatments were well tolerated with no unexpected safety findings.
