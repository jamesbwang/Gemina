  This cross-sectional study was carried out to assess drug prescribing pattern at a tertiary care teaching medical institute. One thousand prescriptions were randomly collected and analyzed using the world health organization prescribing indicators. The average number of drugs per prescription was 2.91. The percentage of drugs prescribed by generic name , from the essential drug list ( National) and as fixed dose combinations ( FDCs) was 10.05 % , 22.57 % , and 49.22 % , respectively. The total percentage of encounters with antibiotics , injectables , and FDCs was 19.70 % , 2.20 % , and 73.60 % , respectively. The most common group of drug prescribed was gastrointestinal tract drugs ( 26.38 %) followed by Vitamins and Minerals ( 23.12 %) , cardiovascular system drugs ( 11.56 %) and antimicrobials ( 9.63 %). The prescribing practices were not appropriate as they consist of polypharmacy , lesser prescription by generic name , and overprescription of FDCs. There is a need for improvement in the standards of prescribing patterns in many aspects.
