  Gastric cancer ( GC) has a predilection to metastasize to the peritoneum , denoting a poor prognosis. Treatment strategies available for advanced GC have significantly evolved over time and can be categorized into systemic , regional , and surgical. Although systemic therapies have been the mainstay for the treatment of advanced GC , their ability in achieving long-term survival in patients with peritoneal involvement is modest at best. This article describes advances in combined modality treatment of peritoneal metastases , specifically with an emphasis on peritoneal-directed therapies.
