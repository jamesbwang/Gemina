  Adipose tissue has classically functioned as a filler in restoring facial volume. Adipose tissue is also rich in stem cells , which may have a role in regenerative medicine. To summarize the literature on the clinical uses of adipose tissue in scarring , wound<disease> healing , and hair growth and determine if evidence exists for clinical practice changes in dermatology. We utilized the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analysis ( PRISMA) to conduct the review. The PubMed search engine was used to assess the available literature on adipose tissue in scarring , wound<disease> healing , and hair growth. Thirteen studies matched our inclusion criteria. Six of seven studies on scar treatment , all three studies on wound<disease> healing , and all three studies on hair growth demonstrated improved outcomes with adipose tissue treatments. The literature supporting the use of adipose tissue is limited to case series , cohort studies , and small randomized controlled trials , which have an overall low level of evidence. The existing evidence for adipose tissue as a treatment option in scarring , wound<disease> healing , and hair growth is not strong enough to justify changes to current clinical practice. The literature does provide evidence for future large randomized clinical trials.
