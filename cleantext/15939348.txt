  Beijing Douzhir is a traditional Chinese fermented drink produced by the natural fermentation of mung beans as the raw material. Ma tofu is an edible by-product of Douzhir processing. Douzhir microbiota , particularly bacteria involved in the natural fermentation process , has not been clearly established , resulting in limited industrial Douzhir production. Here , three uncooked Douzhir samples ( D group) and three uncooked Ma tofu samples ( M group) ( two replicates per sample) were collected from three manufacturers in different locations in Beijing. The composition and diversity of the bacterial communities in each sample were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. In total , 637 operational taxonomic units ( OTUs) were revealed in the D group through database alignment , and 656 OTUs were found in the M group. The Chao , ACE , and Shannon indices were not significantly different in Douzhir samples from different manufacturers (
