  Strain of Pseudomonas<pathogen> psychrotolerans was cultured on the nutrient agar and in a liquid nutrient broth. Bacterial cells were phage-typed with bacteriophages specific to Pseudomonas. O-antigen was isolated from cells using phenol-water method and mild acid degradation. The following structures of the polysaccharides extracted were established by sugar analysis and 1D , 2D NMR spectroscopy: PSI → 3)- α-D-Manp- ( 1 → 2)- α-D-Manp- ( 1 →; PSII → 3)- α-D-Rhap- ( 1 → 2)- β-D-Rhap- ( 1 → 3)- α-D-Rhap- ( 1 →; α-D-Glcp- ( 1 ˩; 2.
