  Interconnections between the olfactory bulb and the amygdala are a major pathway for triggering strong behavioral responses to a variety of odorants. However , while this broad mapping has been established , the patterns of amygdala feedback connectivity and the influence on olfactory circuitry remain unknown. Here , using a combination of neuronal tracing approaches , we dissect the connectivity of a cortical amygdala ( posteromedial cortical nucleus ( PmCo)) feedback circuit innervating the mouse accessory olfactory bulb. Optogenetic activation of PmCo feedback mainly results in feedforward mitral cell ( MC) inhibition through direct excitation of GABAergic granule cells. In addition , LED-driven activity of corticofugal afferents increases the gain of MC responses to olfactory nerve stimulation. Thus , through corticofugal pathways , the PmCo likely regulates primary olfactory and social odor processing.
