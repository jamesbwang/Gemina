  Myocardial infarction is a major cause of mortality and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> worldwide. One of the most effective methods of this injury is direct delivery of cardioprotective drugs to ischemia-reperfusion ( IR) myocardium. The aim of the present study was to fabricate an adenosine ( Ade) prodrug-based , atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP)- modified nanosystem for the treatment of myocardial infarction. Oleate adenosine prodrug ( Ade-OA) and ANP-distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine-polyethylene glycol were synthesized. ANP-modified Ade-loaded lipid nanocarriers ( ANP Ade/LNCs) were then self-assembled by using solvent evaporation method. In vitro drug release in the presence of plasma was evaluated. In vivo inhibition effect on infarct size , tissue distribution , and pharmacokinetics were investigated in rats with ischemic myocardium after intravenous injection. In vivo inhibition effect on infarct size , tissue distribution , and pharmacokinetics studies in acute myocardial infarction ( AMI) rats showed that ANP Ade/LNCs exhibited better efficiency than non-modified Ade/LNCs and free Ade in all respects. These results indicated that the ANP Ade/LNCs can be used as a promising system for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
