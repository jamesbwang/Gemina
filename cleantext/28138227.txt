  To compare the molar bite force , electromyographic activity , chewing efficiency and thickness of the masseter and temporalis muscles in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) and healthy individuals. Thirty individuals enrolled in the study were divided into the study group ( with ALS , n = 15) and control group ( healthy individuals , n = 15). Data regarding molar bite force ( right and left) , electromyographic activity ( mandibular rest , right and left laterality , protrusion , and maximum voluntary contraction) , chewing efficiency ( habitual and non-habitual) , and masticatory muscle thickness ( rest and maximum voluntary contraction) were tabulated and subjected to statistical analysis ( Student 's t-test , p â‰¤ 0.05). Comparisons between the groups demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the electromyographic activity of the right masseter ( p = 0.03) and left masseter ( p = 0.03) muscles during mandibular rest; left masseter ( p = 0.00) , right temporalis ( p = 0.00) , and left temporalis ( p = 0.03) muscles during protrusion; and right masseter ( p = 0.00) , left masseter ( p = 0.00) , and left temporalis ( p = 0.00) muscles during left laterality , in individuals with ALS as compared with healthy individuals. A statistically significant decrease was observed in the habitual chewing efficiency of the right masseter ( p = 0.00) and right temporalis ( p = 0.04) muscles in individuals with ALS. No statistically significant difference between the groups was found the masticatory muscle thickness and maximal molar bite force. ALS may lead to modifications in the activities of the stomatognathic system , including muscular hyperactivity and reduction in chewing efficiency; however , no change has been observed in the masticatory muscle thickness and molar bite force.
