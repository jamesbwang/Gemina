  The inflammasomes are signaling platforms that promote the activation of inflammatory caspases such as caspases-1 , -4 , -5 , and -11. Recent studies identified gasdermin D ( GSDMD) as an effector for pyroptosis downstream of the inflammasome signaling pathways. Cleavage of GSDMD by inflammatory caspases allows its N-terminal domain to associate with membrane lipids and form pores that induce pyroptotic cell death. Despite the important role of GSDMD in pyroptosis , the molecular mechanisms of GSDMD recognition and cleavage by inflammatory caspases that trigger pyroptosis are poorly understood. Here , we demonstrate that the catalytic domains of inflammatory caspases can directly bind to both the full-length GSDMD and its cleavage site peptide , FLTD. A GSDMD-derived inhibitor ,
