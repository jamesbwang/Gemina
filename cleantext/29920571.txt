  Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography ( HILIC) is a useful tool in glycoproteomic analysis. Glutathione ( GSH) is a well-known zwitterionic tripeptide with great hydrophilicity and biocompatibility and is ubiquitous in biological activities. In this study , a hydrophilic metal-organic framework ( denoted as mMOF@Au @GSH) was synthesized by grafting glutathione on Au-immobilized magnetic MOFs via the affinity between the thiol group in glutathione and Au. Endowed with the high hydrophilicity of glutathione , the large surface area of the MOF and strong magnetic responsiveness of magnetic nanoparticles , the as-prepared mMOF@Au @GSH exhibited high selectivity ( 1: 100) and great sensitivity ( 0.5 fmol μL-1) towards glycopeptides. Furthermore , it also achieved outstanding performance in enriching glycopeptides from complex biological samples. In all , 273 glycopeptides corresponding to 94 glycoproteins were identified from only 2 μL human serum.
