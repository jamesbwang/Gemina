  In this study , we argue that the basic clonal unit that makes up the Barrett 's segment is at the level of the gland. There is expansion of this clonal unit , the gland , by fission , and there is evidence that the Barrett 's segment is itself a clonal proliferation. Barrett 's esophagus arises from both goblet cell-containing metaplasia and non-goblet cell-containing metaplasia and may arise from a stable clone , but the genomic changes occurring are subject to selection , usually with little or no evolution , appearing indolent from the evolutionary perspective. Genomic changes leading to dysplastic phenotypes are selected , but without any single clone predominating within the segment.
