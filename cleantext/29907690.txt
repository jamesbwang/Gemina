  Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) is a central regulator of immune homeostasis. STAT3 levels are strictly controlled , and STAT3 impairment contributes to several diseases including the monogenic autosomal-dominant hyper-immunoglobulin E ( IgE) syndrome<disease> ( AD-HIES). We investigated patients of four consanguineous families with an autosomal-recessive disorder resembling the phenotype of AD-HIES , with symptoms of immunodeficiency , recurrent infections , skeletal abnormalities , and elevated IgE. Patients presented with reduced STAT3 expression and diminished T helper 17 cell numbers , in absence of
