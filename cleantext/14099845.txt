  Understanding how climate change affects host-parasite systems and predicting the consequences for ecosystems , economies , and human health has emerged as an important task for science and society. Some basic insight into this complex problem can be gained by comparing the thermal physiology of interacting host and parasite species. In this study , we compared upper thermal tolerance among three component species in a natural host-parasitoid-hyperparasitoid system from Virginia , USA. To assess the ecological relevance of our results , we also examined a record of maximum daily air temperatures collected near the study site in the last 124 years. We found that the caterpillar host Manduca sexta had a critical thermal maximum ( CTmax) about 4 °C higher than the parasitic wasp , Cotesia congregata , and the hyperparasitic wasp , Conura sp. , had a CTmax about 6 °C higher than its host , C. congregata. We also found significant differences in CTmax among instars and between parasitized and non-parasitized M. sexta. The highest maximum daily air temperature recorded near the study in the last 124 years was 42 °C , which equals the average CTmax of one species ( C. congregata) but is several degrees lower than the average CTmax of the other two species ( M. sexta , Conura sp.) in this study. Our results combined with other studies suggest that significant differences in thermal performance within and among interacting host and parasite species are common in nature and that climate change may be largely disruptive to these systems with responses that are highly variable and complex.
