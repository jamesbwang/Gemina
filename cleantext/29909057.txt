  Almost 2.8 million men in the U.S. are living with prostate cancer ( PC) , accounting for 40 % of all male cancer survivors. Men diagnosed with prostate cancer may experience chronic and debilitating treatment side effects , including sexual and urinary dysfunction , pain and fatigue<symptom>. Side effects can be stressful and can also lead to poor psychosocial functioning. Prior trials reveal that group-based cognitive behavioral stress and self-management ( CBSM) is effective in reducing stress and mitigating some of these symptoms , yet little is known about the effects of culturally-translated CBSM among Spanish-speaking men with PC. This manuscript describes the rationale and study design of a multi-site , randomized controlled trial to determine whether participation in a culturally adapted cognitive behavioral stress management ( C-CBSM) intervention leads to significantly greater reductions in symptom burden and improvements in health-related quality of life relative to participation in a non-culturally adapted cognitive behavioral stress management ( CBSM) intervention. Participants ( N = 260) will be Spanish-speaking Hispanic/Latino men randomized to the standard , non-culturally adapted CBSM intervention ( e.g. , cognitive behavioral strategies , stress management , and health maintenance) or the culturally adapted C-CBSM intervention ( e.g. , content adapted to be compatible with Hispanic/Latino cultural patterns and belief systems , meanings , values and social context) for 10 weeks. Primary outcomes ( i.e. , disease-specific symptom burden and health-related quality of life) will be assessed across time. We hypothesize that a culturally adapted C-CBSM intervention will be more efficacious in reducing symptom burden and improving health-related quality of life among Hispanic/Latino men when compared to a non-culturally adapted CBSM intervention.
