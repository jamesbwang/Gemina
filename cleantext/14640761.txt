  Oral cancer is a common and aggressive cancer with high morbidity , mortality , and recurrence rate globally. Early detection is of utmost importance for cancer prevention and disease management. Currently , tissue biopsy remains the gold standard for oral cancer diagnosis , but it is invasive , which may cause patient discomfort. The application of traditional noninvasive methods-such as vital staining , exfoliative cytology , and molecular imaging-is limited by insufficient sensitivity and specificity. Thus , there is an urgent need for exploring noninvasive , highly sensitive , and specific diagnostic techniques. Nano detection systems are known as new emerging noninvasive strategies that bring the detection sensitivity of biomarkers to nano-scale. Moreover , compared to current imaging contrast agents , nanoparticles are more biocompatible , easier to synthesize , and able to target specific surface molecules. Nanoparticles generate localized surface plasmon resonances at near-infrared wavelengths , providing higher image contrast and resolution. Therefore , using nano-based techniques can help clinicians to detect and better monitor diseases during different phases of oral malignancy. Here , we review the progress of nanotechnology-based methods in oral cancer detection and diagnosis.
