  Dutch maternity care is based on the principle that pregnancy and childbirth are physiological processes. However , the last decade an increase of intra-partum referrals to obstetric-led care has been observed. Most of these referrals are among nulliparous women , non-urgent and occur during the first stage of labour. The increase in referrals seems not associated with better perinatal outcomes. Gain understanding of underlying factors in the decision-making process prior to referral to obstetric-led care among midwives attending childbirth in midwifery-led care. A qualitative study based on in-depth interviews with Dutch midwives ( n = 10) working in midwifery-led care. We performed a thematic analysis based on the hypothetico-deductive and the intuitive-humanist theory. Midwives mentioned knowledge as the basis of a reasoned decision. This included both theoretical knowledge , and knowledge from clinical experience. Influences of others , like the needs and wishes of labouring women were another factor influencing the decision-making , especially in non-urgent situations. Under subjective factors , the fear of being held responsible for professional choices emerged. The decision-making process during childbirth is multi-factorial. The women 's needs and wishes are recognized as of great influence on the decision-making process during childbirth , which is not included as a factor in the hypothetico-deductive or the intuitive-humanist theory. The influence of women 's needs and wishes should be part of models about the intra-partum decision-making process. Midwives should find strategies to support women to make well-informed choices that include adequate information on the consequences of medicalisation in obstetric-led care.
