  It is essential to adjust the responsibilities and function of medical education offices ( MEOs) in regard to the current societal requirements. Therefore , it is a good idea to learn lessons from the experiences about the establishment and function of these offices around the world. The aim of the present study was to carry out a comparative study to investigate the function and structure of MEOs at some of the medical universities from America , Europe , and Asia. This is a comparative , descriptive study that was conducted in 2015. Eleven offices around the world ( in America , Europe , and Asia) were selected for the study. Expert group discussion and literature review were used in order to select research sample. The data were gathered using self-constructed checklists. Content and face validity of the checklist was assessed by gathering feedback from experts. The Kappa coefficient was used to determine the inter-rater reliability. All the 11 offices in our study ( 100 %) dealt with the issues of faculty development and research and scholarship activities. Only one out of the 11 offices ( 27 %) dealt with the issues of society and patient education. Five out of the 11 offices ( 36 %) dealt with the continuing medical education and continuing professional development. Consultation services are provided at seven of the 11 offices ( 64 %). This study revealed both commonalities and differences in the function and structure of MEO among the 11 offices we examined. Based on this study , effective goals and strategies for MEO can be recommended.
