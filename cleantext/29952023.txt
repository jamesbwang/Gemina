  Here , we describe the use of intense pulsed light ( IPL) treatment for 13 cases of erythematotelangiectatic rosacea delivered in three sessions. For two-step irradiation , after the whole face had been irradiated using conventional IPL equipment covering a wide area , localized IPL spot irradiation was performed for visibly dilated capillaries. The therapeutic effect was evaluated by image analysis using Image J and scored by 10 dermatologists using two IPL instruments in combination. This therapeutic approach was found to be much more effective than irradiation using a single instrument. Our findings demonstrate that IPL irradiation using the present method can deliver a sufficient therapeutic effect even with a small number of treatment sessions. Although rosacea is difficult to treat , we believe that IPL can be therapeutically useful in such cases.
