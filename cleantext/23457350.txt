  A human variant in the BDNF gene ( Val66Met; rs6265) is associated with impaired fear extinction. Using super-resolution imaging , we demonstrate that the BDNF Met prodomain disassembles dendritic spines and eliminates synapses in hippocampal neurons. In vivo , ventral CA1 ( vCA1) hippocampal neurons undergo similar morphological changes dependent on their transient co-expression of a SorCS2/p75
