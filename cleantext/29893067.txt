  The invasive and recurrent nature of glioblastoma multiforme<pathogen> ( GBM) is linked to a small subpopulation of cancer cells , which are self-renewing , resistant to standard treatment regimens , and induce formation of new tumors. Matrix stiffness is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation , drug resistance , and reversion to a more invasive phenotype. Therefore , understanding the relationship between matrix stiffness and tumor cell behavior is vital to develop appropriate in vitro tumor models. Here , chitosan-hyaluronic acid ( CHA) polyelectrolyte complex scaffolds are fabricated with statistically significant stiffness variances to characterize the effect of scaffold stiffness on morphology , proliferation , drug resistance , and gene expression in human glioblastoma cells ( U-87 MG). All scaffolds support GBM proliferation over a 12-day culture period , yet larger spheroids are observed in scaffolds with higher stiffness. Additionally , GBM cells cultured in stiffer CHA scaffolds prove significantly more resistant to the common chemotherapeutic temozolomide. Moreover , the stiffer 8 % CHA scaffolds exhibit an increase in expression of drug resistance and invasion related genes compared to 2D culture. CHA scaffolds present a tunable microenvironment for enhanced tumor cell malignancy and may provide a valuable in vitro microenvironment for studying tumor progression and screening anticancer therapies.
