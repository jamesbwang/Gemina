  Male enhancement and erectile dysfunction supplements are typically non-Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) approved and readily available for purchase by anyone. Longstanding priapism is a significant potential side effect. A 25-year-old man presented with a 48-h priapism after taking Rhino 7 Platinum 3000. He required bilateral corpo-glanular shunting to alleviate his priapism. On initial 2-week follow-up , he had significant fibrosis<disease> of the corporal bodies bilaterally and had been unable to achieve an erection. There are few studies performed and few case reports regarding the roles of various supplements in causing priapism. We are unaware of any studies regarding Rhino 7 Platinum 3000. Interestingly , since our initial contact with the FDA Safety Reporting Portal , multiple investigations of Rhino products have demonstrated that sildenafil is a non-labeled ingredient. Given the lack of FDA oversight of many other supplements similar to this one , patients must be wary that the ingredients listed may not be comprehensive and that serious side effects can occur.
