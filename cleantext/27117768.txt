  Public engagement with science ( PES) is an emerging outreach method that builds trust between scientists and public audiences by encouraging two-way conversations and mutual learning about science content and societal values. Building with Biology , a PES initiative focused on synthetic biology , distributed 182 kits with two types of products to informal science education institutions across the United States: 1) hands-on activities for public events , and 2) materials to run public dialogue programs , called forums. This article compares the interest levels , perceived value , and learning of public participants at these events and forums. Forum participants reported slightly higher levels of increased interest in future activities related to PES and synthetic biology; valued aspects of interpersonal interactions central to dialogue-based programming; and described learning about societal decision-making around synthetic biology. Event participants valued enjoyment and access to content and reported slightly larger learning gains. The current study may help program coordinators and educators thoughtfully select a PES product type that promotes outcomes aligned with their goals: events featuring hands-on activities may support greater understanding of scientific relevance , and forum programs might encourage learning and behavior that leads to deliberative processes.
