  Laryngeal cysts<symptom> are rare lesions<symptom> that may occur at any mucosa-lined location within the larynx. Papillomas are also benign lesions<symptom> of the larynx. We report a 34 year-old-patient with a laryngeal cyst<symptom> incidentally found during screening endoscopy and presenting as a soft tissue mass on a computerized tomography scan. A papilloma concomitant with the cyst<symptom> was detected intraoperatively. Concomitant tonsillar cyst<symptom> and papilloma of the larynx. The lesion<symptom> was completely resected with a bipolar radiofrequency plasma ablation ( RFA) device. Pathologic examination showed a tonsillar cyst<symptom> and papilloma in the larynx. Six months later , there has been no evidence of recurrence. To our knowledge , this is the first report of a concomitant tonsillar cyst<symptom> and a papilloma in the larynx. Asymptomatic laryngeal cysts<symptom> can be detected endoscopically. RFA is safe and effective for endoscopic management.
