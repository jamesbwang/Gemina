  Good quality , timely data are the cornerstone of health systems , but in many countries these data are not used for evidence-informed decision making and/or for improving public health. The SORT IT ( Structured Operational Research and Training Initiative) model has , over 8 years , trained health workers in low- and middle-income countries to use data to answer important public health questions by taking research projects through to completion and publication in national or international journals. The D2P ( data to policy) training initiative is relatively new , and it teaches health workers how to apply ` decision analysis ' and develop policy briefs for policy makers: this includes description of a problem and the available evidence , quantitative comparisons of policy options that take into account predicted health and economic impacts , and political and feasibility assessments. Policies adopted from evidence-based information generated through the SORT IT and D2P approaches can be evaluated to assess their impact , and the cycle repeated to identify and resolve new public health problems. Ministries of Health could benefit from this twin-training approach to make themselves ` data rich , information rich and action rich ' , and thereby use routinely collected data in a synergistic manner to improve public health policy making and health care delivery.
