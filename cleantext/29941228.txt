  Despite the consensus achieved in the homogenization of clinical criteria by categorical psychiatric classification systems ( DEM and CIE) , they are criticized for a lack of validity and inability to guide clinical treatment and research. In this review article we introduce the Research Domain Criteria ( RDoC) framework as an alternative framework for translational research in psychiatry. The RDOC framework systematizes both research targets and methodology for research in psychiatry. RDoC is based on a catalogue of neurobiological and neurocognitive evidence of behaviour , and conceives psychopathology as the phenotypic expression of alterations of functional domains that are classified into 5psychobiological systems. The RdoC framework also proposes that domains must be validated with evidence in 7levels of analysis: genes , molecules , cells , nerve circuits , physiology , behaviour and self-reports. As opposed to categorical systems focused on diagnosis , RDoC focuses on the study of psychopathology as a correlate of detectable functional , biological and behavioural disruption of normal processes. In order to build a useful psychiatric nosology for guiding clinical interventions , the RDoC research framework links the neurobiological basis of mental processes with phenotypical manifestations. Although the RDoC findings have not yet been articulated into a specific model for guiding clinical practice , they provide a useful transition system for creating clinical , basic and epidemiological research hypotheses.
