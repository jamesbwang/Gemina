  We extend the well-known static duality ( M. Girardeau , J. Math. Phys. 1 , 516 ( 1960) JMAPAQ0022-248810.1063/ 1.1703687; T. Cheon and T. Shigehara , Phys. Rev. Lett. 82 , 2536 ( 1999) PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/ PhysRevLett .82.2536) between one-dimensional ( 1D) bosons and 1D fermions to the dynamical version. By utilizing this dynamical duality , we find the duality of nonequilibrium work distributions between interacting 1D bosonic ( Lieb-Liniger model) and 1D fermionic ( Cheon-Shigehara model) systems with dual contact interactions. As a special case , the work distribution of the Tonks-Girardeau gas is identical to that of 1D noninteracting fermionic system even though their momentum distributions are significantly different. In the classical limit , the work distributions of Lieb-Liniger models ( Cheon-Shigehara models) with arbitrary coupling strength converge to that of the 1D noninteracting distinguishable particles , although their elementary excitations ( quasiparticles) obey different statistics , e.g. , the Bose-Einstein , the Fermi-Dirac , and the fractional statistics. We also present numerical results of the work distributions of Lieb-Liniger model with various coupling strengths , which demonstrate the convergence of work distributions in the classical limit.
