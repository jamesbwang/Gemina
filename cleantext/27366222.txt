  The role of programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1) and its ligands in the dysregulation of T helper immune responses observed in the inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) is unclear. Recently , a novel concept emerged that CD90 Tissues and cells derived from Crohn 's disease ( CD) , ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) , and healthy individuals ( N) were studied A significant increase in programmed death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1) was observed in the inflamed UC colonic mucosa when compared to the non-inflamed matched tissue samples , CD , and healthy controls. UC-CMFs were among the major populations in the colonic mucosa contributing to the enhanced PD-L1 expression. In contrast , PD-L1 expression was decreased in CD-CMFs. When compared to CD-CMFs and N-CMFs , UC-CMFs demonstrated stronger suppression of IL-2 , Th1 transcriptional factor Tbet , and IFN-Î³ expression by CD3/CD28-activated CD4 We present evidence showing that increased PD-L1 expression suppresses Th1 cell activity in UC. In contrast , loss of PD-L1 expression observed in CD contributes to the persistence of the Th1 inflammatory milieu in CD. Our data suggest that dysregulation of the Th1 responses in the inflamed colonic mucosa of IBD patients is promoted by the alterations in PD-L1 expression in the mucosal mesenchymal stromal cell compartment.
