  This study aimed to evaluate the psychological and physiological adjustment in a sample of Ovarian Cancer survivors. For all we know , this is the first time that such analysis has been performed in Italy. We assessed psychological adjustment along with physiological adjustment , measured through the basal Heart Rate Variability at rest. We assessed 38 women overall , aged 29-80 years , in follow up for ovarian cancer. Each participant filled a psycho-oncological record , Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support , Derridford Appearance Scale-59 , Mental Adjustment to Cancer and EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire LQ-30 Version 3.0. For each participant , we recorded Heart Rate Variability ( 5 min). These women have shown a high rate of perceived general social support ( Me = 5.93) but they seem to have some general concern about their appearance ( Me = 85.97 , SD = 24.4). They have also shown a rather good total Quality of Life ( QL2 Me = 66.32) with specific difficulties in emotional functioning ( EF; Me = 69.19). Heart Rate Variability values , however , were lower of nearly 50 % when compared to normative values. These women , then , seem to drag concerns and difficulties , in particular linked to the acceptance of their condition. Surprisingly enough , the best adjustment in these women seems to be related to the worst starting conditions. It is possible to suggest that the extremely negative conditions force these women to face cancer openly , as well as their condition of cancer survivors , pushing them `` moving on '' more than `` trying to get back ''.
