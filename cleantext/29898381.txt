  To propose a simple classification system for buried penis repairs and present an analysis of perioperative data based on category. Patients undergoing buried penis repair at a single institution were examined. Classification was as follows: Category I- Penile Unburying with Local Flap; II- Skin Graft; III- Scrotal Surgery; IV- Escutcheonectomy; V- Abdominal Panniculectomy. Complex repairs were Category III or above. Success was defined as an unburied penis without additional unburying surgery. Between 2007 to 2017 , 64 patients underwent repair with 44 ( 69 %) considered complex. Patients undergoing complex repairs had a higher BMI ( median 48 vs. 36 kg/m Buried penis repairs are highly successful. We propose a classification based on surgical complexity. Patients requiring complex repairs have higher BMI and increased risk of high-grade complications. While urethral strictures are found in nearly half of patients , there is no association with the severity of disease. Ongoing modifications of technique and perioperative care may improve outcomes.
