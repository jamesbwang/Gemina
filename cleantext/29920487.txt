  The aim of the study was to examine the association of CHADS2/CHA2DS2-VASc scores with left atrial thrombus ( LAT) and spontaneous echocardiographic contrast ( SEC) in non-anticoagulated nonvalvular atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( NVAF) spontaneous patients , and to develop a new scoring system for LAT/SEC prediction. Consecutive non-anticoagulated NVAF patients with or without LAT/SEC by transesophageal echocardiography were identified in the Guangdong General Hospital. Among 2,173 patients , the prevalence of LAT/SEC was 4.9 %. Both predictive values of CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores for the presence of LAT/SEC were low-to-moderate ( receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) = 0.591 and 0.608 , respectively , p = 0.90). By multivariate analysis , non-paroxysmal AF , decreased left ventricular ejection fraction , and left atrial enlargement were positively associated with LAT/SEC , while CHADS2/CHA2DS2VASc scores were not. A new scoring system based on these 3 factors above significantly improved the discrimination for LAT/SEC ( ROC = 0.792). CHADS2/CHA2DS2-VASc scores had limited value in predicting LAT/SEC; a new scoring system that combines AF type and echocardiographic parameters may better predict LAT/SEC as a surrogate for cardioembolic risk in NVAF patients.
