  Transfeminine individuals are treated with estradiol and anti-androgen agents to transition to a more feminine appearance. The physical changes that occur with estradiol therapy include breast development , body fat redistribution , and decreased muscle mass. Transfeminine treatment regimens require monitoring and dose adjustments to achieve appropriate physiologic targets to enhance feminization and decrease risk of adverse outcomes. Adverse effects associated with estradiol use include thromboembolic disease , macroprolactinoma , breast cancer , coronary artery disease , cerebrovascular disease , cholelithiasis , and hypertriglyceridemia. Benefits of hormonal treatment may include both an improvement in quality of life and a decrease in gender dysphoria.
