  Amphotericin B ( AmB) , a potent antifungal drug , presents physicochemical characteristics that impair the development of suitable dosage forms. In order to overcome the AmB insolubility , several lipid carriers such as microemulsions have been developed. In this context , the bullfrog oil stands out as an eligible oily phase component , since its cholesterol composition may favor the AmB incorporation. Thus , the aim of this study was to develop a microemulsion based on bullfrog oil containing AmB. Moreover , its thermal stability , antifungal activity , and cytotoxicity in vitro were evaluated. The microemulsion formulation was produced using the pseudo-ternary phase diagram ( PTPD) approach and the AmB was incorporated based on the pH variation technique. The antifungal activity was evaluated by determination of minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC) against different species of Candida<pathogen> spp. and Trichosporon<pathogen> asahii<pathogen> The bullfrog oil microemulsion , stabilized with 16.8 % of a surfactant blend , presented an average droplet size of 26.50 ± 0.14 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.167 ± 0.006. This system was able to entrap AmB up to 2 mg mL
