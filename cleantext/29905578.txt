  The present review describes our research experiences and efforts in advancing the field of infection prevention and control in nursing facilities including postacute and long-term care settings. There are over two million infections in postacute and long-term care settings each year in the United States and $ 4 billion in associated costs. To define a target group most amenable to infection prevention and control interventions , we sought to quantify the relation between indwelling device use and microbial colonization in nursing facility patients. Using various methodologies including survey methods , observational epidemiology , randomized controlled studies , and collaboratives , we showed that ( 1) indwelling device type is related to the site of multidrug-resistant organism ( MDRO) colonization; ( 2) multianatomic site colonization with MDROs is common; ( 3) community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) appeared in the nursing facility setting almost immediately following its emergence in acute care; ( 4) MDRO prevalence and catheter-associated infection rates can be reduced through a multimodal targeted infection prevention intervention; and ( 5) using a collaborative approach , such an intervention can be successfully scaled up. Our work advances the infection prevention field through translational research utilizing various methodologies , including quantitative and qualitative surveys , patient-oriented randomized controlled trials , and clinical microbiologic and molecular methods. The resulting interventions employ patient-oriented methods to reduce infections and antimicrobial resistance , and with partnerships from major national entities , can be implemented nationally.
