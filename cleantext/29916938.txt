  The fragility index ( FI) may prove to be a powerful metric of trial robustness. The FI is the minimum number of patient events that would need to become nonevents in order to nullify a significant result. The fragility quotient ( FQ) is the FI divided by the total sample size. This study evaluates the robustness of the 20 % of orthopaedic clinical trials that were cited as having strong evidence in the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons ( AAOS) Clinical Practice Guidelines and that could be analyzed with these indices. From the AAOS recommendations with strong evidence , we extracted the randomized controlled trials that were cited as having supporting evidence that could be analyzed with the FI. Each trial 's FI was calculated using the fragility calculator ( http://www.fragilityindex.com). With use of the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0 , we evaluated the likelihood of bias. We also performed a post hoc power analysis of eligible studies. The median FI for the 72 trials was 2 events , and the median FQ was 0.022. Of the 72 trials , only 3 ( 4.2 %) were at a low risk of bias , and 35 ( 48.6 %) were at a high risk of bias. Thirty-eight ( 53 %) of the trials were underpowered. We identified a strong correlation between a trial 's FI or FQ and the trial 's power. Our study found that trials that provided strong evidence for orthopaedic surgery guidelines were largely fragile , underpowered , and at risk of bias.
