  Multidisciplinary intervention programs for overweight and obese children mainly focus on reducing bodyweight and body mass index ( BMI) , but they may also positively impact blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) , and cardiorespiratory fitness ( CRF) , which is a stronger predictor for all-cause mortality than BMI. To evaluate whether Kids4Fit , a multidisciplinary weight reduction program , has a positive effect on CRF and BP in overweight and obese children in socially deprived areas. A quasi-experimental study design with a waiting list control period including children who participated in a multidisciplinary intervention program of 12 weeks was set-up. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> measurements and shuttle-run test ( SRT) were performed at baseline , at the start of the intervention , at the end of intervention and after 52 weeks. The effect of Kids4Fit on BP and on SRT scores were analyzed using mixed models. A total of 154 children were included ( mean age 8.5 years ( SD 1.8)). No significant change was seen in systolic BP percentiles at 52 weeks after start of the Kids4Fit intervention ( β 0.08 , ( 95 % CI -0.06 , 0.22)). Diastolic BP percentiles increased significantly over time ( β 0.20 ( 0.08 , 0.31)). Effect plots showed an initial significant increase of the SRT scores but this effect diluted after the intervention. A local multidisciplinary intervention program in deprived areas had a significant positive effect on CRF , but this effect diluted after the intervention. Diastolic BP percentiles significantly increased over time. However , systolic BP did not change over time.
