  A novel LiMn ₂ O ₄- graphene flexible film is successfully prepared by facile vacuum filtration technique. LiMn ₂ O ₄ nanowires with diameters of 50 ⁻ 100 nm are distributed homogeneously on graphene sheet matrix. Used as cathode in rechargeable hybrid aqueous batteries , the LiMn ₂ O ₄- graphene film exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance in comparison to LiMn ₂ O ₄- graphene powder. The LiMn ₂ O ₄- graphene film shows stable 13.0 mAh g
