  Morel-Lavallée lesions<symptom> are rare , closed degloving soft tissue injuries in which the skin and subcutaneous tissues are traumatic separated from the underlying fascia. There is lack of consensus regarding optimal management of these lesions<symptom>. After failure of conservative management , operative intervention is imperative. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe a minimally invasive endoscopic method for treatment of Morel-Lavallée Lesions , which achieves the goal of an open surgical debridement.
