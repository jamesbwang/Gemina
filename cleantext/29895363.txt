  In developing countries , Thimerosal-containing vaccines ( TCV) are the main causes of organic Hg exposure for newborns , neonates , and infants immunized with TCV. This article addresses early-life exposure to this unique organic mercury compound ( ethylmercury-EtHg) and the risks of its exposure. English language studies pertaining to Thimerosal/EtHg toxicity and exposure during early life were searched in PubMed; and , those publications judged to be relevant to the topic of this review were selected. The risk from the neurotoxic effects of pre- and post-natal Hg exposures depend , in part , on aggravating or attenuating environmental and/or genetic-associated factors. Health authorities in charge of controlling infectious<disease> disease<disease> dismiss the toxicology of mercury ( immunological and subtle neurological effects as insignificant) related to low-dose Thimerosal. The review addresses the evidence that brings into question the safety of Thimerosal that is still present in vaccines given to pregnant women , infants , and children in developing countries , and recognizes the ethical imperative to extend the use of Thimerosal-free vaccines to developing countries , not just developed countries.
