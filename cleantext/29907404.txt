  The present study reports the mycological data collected from two corpses preserved in controlled conditions and monitored for 6 weeks at the mortuary. On the whole during the monitoring more than 70 fungal CFU ( Colony Forming Units) were sampled from the corpses. The data collected were used to map the body fungal colonization of the corpses during 6 weeks. The two body maps show a huge difference between these cases , mainly due to the perimortem conditions. In particular , in the case one the facial area colonised by fungi<pathogen> rose from 15 % to 63 % in six weeks , while the fungal colonization of case two was about 1 % for the whole monitoring period. This work shows , for the first time , the data about the pattern of colonization and distribution of fungi<pathogen> on real corpses after death and argues about the influence of perimortem settings on fungal colonization. Moreover , the paper suggests exploiting the study of fungal colony development and maturation to assess post-mortem interval ( PMI).
