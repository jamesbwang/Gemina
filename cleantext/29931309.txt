  Endoscopy has an important role in the pre- and post-treatment staging of esophageal cancer. Complete pathologic response following neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy occurs in approximately 25 % of patients. However , the ability to accurately detect this preoperatively with currently available endoscopic modalities is limited such that the default pathway is for fit patients to proceed with surgical resection. This article discusses the available endoscopic modalities ( primarily Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD) with mucosal biopsies and endoscopic ultrasonography with or without fine needle aspiration) used for post-treatment staging of esophageal cancer. We present data regarding the benefits and limitations of endoscopic methods in assessing for residual disease. Unfortunately , endoscopic modalities are not accurate enough to identify complete pathological responsers who may avoid surgical resection.
