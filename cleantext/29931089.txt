  The Repressor Element 1-silencing transcription factor ( REST) represses a number of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells or in undifferentiated neural progenitors. Here , we report that the DEAD box RNA helicase DDX17 controls important REST-related processes that are critical during the early phases of neuronal differentiation. First , DDX17 associates with REST , promotes its binding to the promoter of a subset of REST-targeted genes and co-regulates REST transcriptional repression activity. During neuronal differentiation , we observed a downregulation of DDX17 along with that of the REST complex that contributes to the activation of neuronal genes. Second , DDX17 and its paralog DDX5 regulate the expression of several proneural microRNAs that are known to target the REST complex during neurogenesis , including miR-26a/ b that are also direct regulators of DDX17 expression. In this context , we propose a new mechanism by which RNA helicases can control the biogenesis of intronic miRNAs. We show that the processing of the miR-26a2 precursor is dependent on RNA helicases , owing to an intronic regulatory region that negatively impacts on both miRNA processing and splicing of its host intron. Our work places DDX17 in the heart of a pathway involving REST and miRNAs that allows neuronal gene repression.
