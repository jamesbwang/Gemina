  To identify risk and protective factors for unintentional death related to drug poisoning<disease> from prescription medications , including opioid-related deaths , and death due to all other causes among participants with spinal cord injury ( SCI). Prospective cohort study. Large specialty hospital in the Southeastern United States. Two cohorts of SCI participants , totaling 3070 adults ( > 18 years old) with chronic ( > 1 year) traumatic SCI. Cohort 1 was enrolled in 1997-1998 ( n = 1386) and cohort 2 was enrolled in 2007-2009 ( n = 1684). N/A MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE ( S): Participants completed self-report assessments including multiple behavioral variables ( alcohol , smoking , and prescription medication) , as well as the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire ( ZKPQ). The primary outcome is unintentional death related to drug poisoning<disease>. Mortality status was determined as of December 31 , 2014 , using the National Death Index. Centers for Disease Control guidelines were used for classifying participants into 3 groups: ( 1) unintentional death related to drug poisoning<disease> , ( 2) other death , and ( 3) alive. There were 690 deaths ( 23 %) , including 24 unintentional deaths related to drug poisoning<disease> ( 11 from opioids). Binge drinking , medication usage total score , and impulsive-sensation seeking were risk factors for unintentional death related to drug poisoning<disease> , whereas the ZKPQ activity scale was protective. Risk factors for other causes of death included older age , greater injury severity , being non-ambulatory , regular smoker , medication use total score , and greater neuroticism-anxiety scale scores. Unintentional deaths related to prescription drug overdose are associated with a set of risk factors that differs in meaningful ways from risk of death due to other causes after SCI , and these differences hold the key to prevention strategies.
