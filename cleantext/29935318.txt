  Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis ( EDAS) as a form of indirect revascularization has been recently proposed as a potentially promising alternative for patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease ( ICAD). The object of this study was to compare the prognostic roles between isolated EDAS and medical therapy in patients with atherosclerotic middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO). From January 2014 to June 2017 , 125 patients with atherosclerotic MCAO were enrolled in this prospective nonrandomized controlled cohort study. Patients who underwent EDAS ( n = 60) were compared with those treated medically ( n = 65). Early and late adverse events and functional outcomes including memory ability were compared between groups. During 23.7 months of mean follow-up , rates of adverse events , including ischemic events in the territory of the qualifying middle cerebral artery , and death from any causes , were not significantly different in patients treated with EDAS and with medical therapy ( 6.7 % vs. 12.3 %; P = 0.285). Landmark analyses showed that at initial 6-month follow-up , there was no significant difference for adverse event rates , whereas the opposite finding was shown for the subsequent period ( EDAS 1/57 ( 1.7 %) vs. medical management 7/64 ( 10.9 %); P = 0.024). The P value for the interaction between time ( first 6 months vs. subsequent period) was 0.044. No significant differences were found with respect to neural function status and cognitive ability. In the long-term , isolated EDAS can be considered effective and safe for patients with atherosclerotic MCAO , whereas it may need additional medical therapy support in the short-term.
