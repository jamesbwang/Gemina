  Pelvic exenteration ( PE) for locally advanced pelvic malignancy requires a multi-disciplinary approach and is associated with significant morbidity. Urinary reconstruction forms a major component of this procedure. The aim of the study is to review the urological outcomes following PE in a newly established pelvic oncology unit , to compare with those following radical cystectomy ( RC) for bladder cancer. Patients were identified from prospectively maintained PE and bladder cancer databases , inclusive of all cases performed between January 2012 and December 2016. Those without urinary reconstructions and follow-up durations of less than 3 months were excluded. The outcomes of PE and RC cases were compared , stratifying surgical complications using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. There were 22 PE cases and 27 RC cases. The median age at surgery was 56 and 65 years , with a median follow-up of 11.7 and 19.8 months , in the PE and RC groups , respectively. Urinary reconstructions comprised n = 20 ( 91 %) conduit diversions and n = 2 ( 9 %) ureteral reimplantations in the PE group , and n = 5 ( 19 %) orthotopic bladder substitutes and n = 22 ( 81 %) ileal conduits in the RC group. The 30-day urological complication rate was 23 % in the PE group ( n = 4 Clavien-Dindo Grade 1-2 , and n = 1 Grade 3) versus 11 % in the RC group ( n = 1 Grade 1-2 , and n = 2 Grade 3) , P = 0.801. There were no Grade 4-5 complications in this series. The urological outcomes following PE in complex pelvic oncology are reasonable and not inferior to those after primary RC alone.
