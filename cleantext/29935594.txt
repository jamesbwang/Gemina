  The biological perturbation associated with psychological and surgical stress is implicated in cancer recurrence. Preclinical evidence suggests that beta-blockers can be protective against cancer progression. We undertook a meta-analysis of epidemiological and perioperative clinical studies to investigate the association between beta-blocker use and cancer recurrence ( CR) , disease-free survival ( DFS) , and overall survival ( OS). Databases were searched until September 2017 , reported hazard ratios ( HRs) pooled , and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) calculated. Comparative studies examining the effect of beta-blockers ( selective and non-selective) on cancer outcomes were included. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assess methodological quality and bias. Of the 27 included studies , nine evaluated the incidental use of non-selective beta-blockers , and ten were perioperative studies. Beta-blocker use had no effect on CR. Within subgroups of cancer , melanoma was associated with improved DFS ( HR 0.03 , 95 % CI 0.01-0.17) and OS ( HR 0.04 , 95 % CI 0.00-0.38) , while endometrial cancer had an associated reduction in DFS ( HR 1.40 , 95 % CI 1.10-1.80) and OS ( HR 1.50 , 95 % CI 1.12-2.00). There was also reduced OS seen with head and neck and prostate cancer. Non-selective beta-blocker use was associated with improved DFS and OS in ovarian cancer , improved DFS in melanoma , but reduced OS in lung cancer. Perioperative studies showed similar variable effects across cancer types , albeit from a limited data pool. Beta-blocker use had no evident effect on CR. The beneficial effect of beta-blockers on DFS and OS in the epidemiological or perioperative setting remains variable , tumour-specific , and of low-level evidence at present.
