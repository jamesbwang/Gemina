  It is established that bone tissue adapts and responds to mechanical loading. Several studies have suggested an existence of positive influence of vibration on the bone mass maintenance. Thus , some bone regeneration therapies are based on vibration of bone tissue under circumstances of disease to stimulate its formation. Frequency of loading should be properly selected and therefore a correct characterization of the dynamic properties of this tissue may be critical for the success of such orthopedic techniques. On the other hand , many studies implement vibration techniques with in silico models. Numerical results are exclusively dependent on properties of bone tissue , i.e. geometry , density distribution and stiffness , as well as boundary conditions. In the present study , the influence of boundary conditions and material properties on the dynamic characteristics of bone tissue was explored in a human femur. Bone shape and density were directly reconstructed from computer tomographies , whereas natural frequencies and modes of vibration were obtained for different boundary conditions including physiological and mechanical ones. Results of this study show the moderate effect of material properties compared to the much substantial effect of boundary conditions. A factor of 2 in the natural frequency was obtained depending on imposed boundary conditions , highlighting the importance in the selection of appropriate conditions in the analysis of the bone organ.
