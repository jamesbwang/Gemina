  Semiconductor nanowire-based devices are among the most promising structures used to meet the current challenges of electronics , optics and photonics. Due to their high surface-to-volume ratio and excellent optical and electrical properties , devices with low power , high efficiency and high density can be created. This is of major importance for environmental issues and economic impact. Semiconductor nanowires have been used to fabricate high performance devices , including detectors , solar cells and transistors. Here , we demonstrate a technique for transferring large-area nanowire arrays to flexible substrates while retaining their excellent quantum efficiency in emission. Starting with a defect-free self-catalyzed molecular beam epitaxy ( MBE) sample grown on a Si substrate , GaAs core-shell nanowires are embedded in a dielectric , removed by reactive ion etching and transferred to a plastic substrate. The original structural and optical properties , including the vertical orientation , of the nanowires are retained in the final plastic substrate structure. Nanowire emission is observed for all stages of the fabrication process , with a higher emission intensity observed for the final transferred structure , consistent with a reduction in nonradiative recombination via the modification of surface states. This transfer process could form the first critical step in the development of flexible nanowire-based light-emitting devices.
