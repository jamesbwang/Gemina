  To compare the cephalometric characteristics of thalassemic children in the Indian subcontinent with the controls , matched for sex and dental age. A total of 31 thalassemic children were a part of the study. Cephalometric readings were recorded for the study and the control group. Within the Group I stage , the anterior cranial base length was 68.40 ± 2.93 mm , shorter when compared to the control group. In the Group II stage , the maxillary/mandibular angle was 31.58 ° for the case group and the mandibular length was shorter in comparison to the controls. In the Group III stage , the SNB angle was 76.42 ° , lesser than the control group. A relative maxillary prognathism of 9.88 mm and 12.85 mm was observed in thalassemic males and females respectively through the Wiley 's analysis. The overall picture depicted a retruded position of the maxilla and a retrognathic mandible within the study group. A class II profile has also been observed among the study subjects.
