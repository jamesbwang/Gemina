  The prevalence of childhood obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorder such as dyslipidemia has sharply increased in the past few decades. Chronic low-grade inflammation<symptom> is associated with the development of comorbidities and poor prognosis in obesity. This study aims to evaluate interleukin-10 ( IL-10) in childhood obesity with hypertriglyceridemia. We evaluated IL-10 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) mRNA expression in adipose tissue ( AT) as well as serum IL-10 in 62 children of 3 groups and in high-fat diet ( HFD) induced obese rat. Expression of IL-10 and STAT3 protein in AT of diet-induced obese rats were examined over feed period. Adipose IL-10 and STAT3 mRNA expression and serum IL-10 reduced in obese children with hypertriglyceridemia and in HFD obese rats. The protein expression of IL-10 and STAT3 decreased in AT of obese rats compared with the control rats at end time. Expression of IL-10 mRNA was negatively correlated to TG and LDL-C levels , and positively correlated to HDL-C , adiponectin and serum IL-10 levels. IL-10 expression and its downstream JAK-STAT pathway are down-regulated in obese children with hypertriglyceridemia and in HFD obese rats.
