  Objectives To evaluate the incidence and nature of complications associated with diagnostic and interventional sialendoscopies and to report intervention failures in a prospective setup. Study Design Prospective observational study. Setting Academic tertiary care university hospital. Subjects and Methods Patients who underwent diagnostic or interventional sialendoscopy between October 2015 and December 2016 were prospectively enrolled. Patient data , operation-related factors , treatment failures , and complications were recorded into a database and analyzed. Results A total of 140 sialendoscopies were attempted or performed on 118 patients; 67 ( 48 %) were for a parotid<symptom> gland and 73 ( 52 %) for a submandibular gland. The sialendoscopy was interventional in 81 cases ( 58 %) , diagnostic in 56 ( 40 %) , and not possible to perform in 3 ( 2.1 %). A total of 21 complications were registered for 21 sialendoscopies ( 15 %) and 21 patients ( 18 %). The most common complication was infection , in 9 cases ( 6.4 %). Other observed complications were salivary duct perforation ( 4 cases) , prolonged glandular swelling ( 3 cases) , transient lingual nerve analgesia ( 2 cases) , basket entrapment ( 2 cases) , and transient weakness<symptom> in the marginal branch of the facial nerve ( 1 case). All complications were related to interventional procedures or papilla dilatation. Failure to treat occurred in 21 ( 15 %) sialendoscopies: sialendoscopy itself was unsuccessful in 3 cases , and an intended intervention failed in 18 cases. Conclusion Complications in sialendoscopy are usually related to interventional procedures. The complications are mainly minor and temporary but lead to additional follow-up visits , further treatments , and sometimes hospitalization. Sialendoscopic procedures are safe but not free of complications.
