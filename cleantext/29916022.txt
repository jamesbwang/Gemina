  The discovery of TDP-43 as a major disease protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( FTLD) was first made in 2006. Prior to 2006 there were only 11 publications related to TDP-43 , now there are over 2000 , indicating the importance of TDP-43 to unraveling the complex molecular mechanisms that underpin the pathogenesis of ALS/FTLD. Subsequent to this discovery , TDP-43 pathology was also found in other neurodegenerative diseases , including Alzheimer 's disease , the significance of which is still in the early stages of exploration. TDP-43 is a predominantly nuclear DNA/RNA-binding protein , one of a number of RNA-binding proteins that are now known to be linked with ALS/FTLD , including Fused in Sarcoma<disease> ( FUS) , heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 ( hnRNP A1) , and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 ( hnRNP A2/B1). However , what sets TDP-43 apart is the vast number of cases in which TDP-43 pathology is present , providing a point of convergence , the understanding of which could lead to broadly applicable therapeutics. Here we will focus on TDP-43 in ALS/FTLD , its nuclear and cytoplasmic functions , and consequences should these functions go awry.
