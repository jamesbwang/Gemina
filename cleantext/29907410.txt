  Analysis of phosphoproteins always faces the challenge of low stoichiometry , which demands highly selective and efficient enrichment in the initial sample preparation. Here we report our synthesis of the novel titanium ( IV) ion immobilized adenosine triphosphate functionalized silica nanoparticles ( Ti
