  Currently , nanomaterials with peroxidase activity have become an important colorimetric tool for biomolecular detection. However , compared with natural enzymes , the efficiency of most nanozymes is still lower. Here , with a leaf-like metal-organic-framework-5 as both a precursor and a template and copper acetate as a second precursor , hierarchical Cu hydroxy double salt ( HDS) nanoflowers have been prepared and used as a label-free glucose colorimetric detection platform. We have demonstrated a scalable and facile synthesis of hierarchical Cu HDS nanoflowers , and density functional theory ( DFT) calculations confirmed that there exists a hydrogen bond between the terephthalate anions and the layer OH group. The composition of Cu hydroxyl double salt is ( Cu4 ( OH) 6) ( BDC) · 2H2O. Importantly , for the first time , the as-prepared Cu HDSs were demonstrated as peroxidase mimics to catalyze the oxidation of the enzyme substrate , 3 ' ,5,5 '- tetramethylbenzidine ( TMB) in the presence of H2O2 , which accompanies a color<symptom> change<symptom> from colorless to blue and followed classic Michaelis-Menten models. Based on these findings , a colorimetric method based on Cu HDSs that is highly sensitive and selective for the detection of glucose was developed , with a low detection limit of 0.5 μM. The clinical applicability of the sensor is also proven to be suitable for sensing glucose in blood , suggesting that Cu HDSs could be used in the construction of portable sensors for point-of-care diagnosis and on-site tests.
