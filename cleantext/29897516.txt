  The clinical performance of fillers in soft tissue augmentation depends upon their physiochemical properties , anatomical areas injected , interaction with the recipient , and the skill and experience of the physician. Scientific measures of filler properties facilitate appropriate selection of treatments for optimal treatment outcomes , and inform adjustments to treatments that improve patient safety and aesthetic outcomes. The rheological properties of calcium hydroxylapatite ( CaHA) , elastic modulus ( G ') and viscosity , coupled with its capacity to offer both immediate results and continued stimulation of collagen type I deposition , support its distinction as an ideal treatment for the volume loss characteristic of aging. Furthermore , the comparatively higher G ' of CaHA offers a physiochemical basis for the clinical performance observed by the authors , especially in regions such as the temple and chin , where the force exerted by CaHA against bone permits expansion of overlaying tissue , permitting it to behave as a liquid implant.
