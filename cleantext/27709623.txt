  Charge trap in amorphous perfluoro-polymer electret is studied , focusing on electron trap site and trap energy. Low-energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy is adopted to measure solid-state electron affinity ( EA) of cyclic transparent optical polymer ( CYTOP). EA of CYTOP CTL-S is discovered by compensating the unwanted charge-up effect. Negatively-charged electret materials ( polyethylene , ethylene-tetra-fluoro-ethylene , poly-tetra-fluoro-ethylene , and CYTOP) are analyzed by quantum mechanical calculation. Density functional theory with long-range correction is adopted to analyze orbital energies of single molecular systems. Intramolecular distribution of trapped electron and EA are investigated. Calculated electron affinities of CYTOP polymers with different end group are qualitatively in accordance with trapped charge stability measured with thermal stimulated discharge , signifying that electron affinities obtained with the present simulation can be used as an index of amorphous polymer electret.
