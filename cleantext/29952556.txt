  Metal organic framework ( MOF)/ polymer composite membranes<symptom> are of interest for gas separations , as they often have performance that exceeds the neat polymer. However , traditional composite membranes<symptom> , known as mixed matrix membranes<symptom> ( MMMs) , can have complex and time-consuming preparation procedures. The MOF and polymer are traditionally prepared separately and require priming and mixing to ensure uniform distribution of particles and compatibility of the polymer-particle interface. In this study , we reduce the number of steps using an in situ MOF growth strategy. Herein , MMMs are prepared by growing MOF ( UiO-66) in situ within a Matrimid polymer matrix while simultaneously curing the matrix. The gas separation performance for MMMs , prepared using this approach , was evaluated for the CO
