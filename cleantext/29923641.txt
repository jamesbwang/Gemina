  Manipulation of the emission properties of pure organic molecules through external stimuli is attractive but challenging. Herein , we report a dual-emissive hexathiobenzene-based molecule with significant aggregation-induced phosphorescence characteristic , and demonstrate reversible switching among blue fluorescence , green fluorescence and yellow phosphorescence by controlling molecular aggregation state or protonation state. Variation of solvent or pH value manipulates the interconversion between fluorescence and phosphorescence , while the change in protonation state in organic solvent switches two shorted-lived emissions in a controllable manner. Such a controlled manipulation is achieved by rational design of combining twisted structure and proper arrangement in excited states. This work provides a new design principle for organic molecules with efficient room-temperature phosphorescence and tunable singlet-triplet emissive properties , and contributes to design and development of smart materials and intelligent optoelectronic devices.
