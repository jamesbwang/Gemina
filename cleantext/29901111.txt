  Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL) is a distinct and highly aggressive subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Dihydrocelastrol ( DHCE) is a dihydro-analog of celastrol , which is isolated from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Tripterygium wilfordii. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of DHCE treatment on MCL cells , and to determine the mechanism underlying its potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo using the Cell Counting kit-8 assay , clonogenic assay , apoptosis assay , cell cycle analysis , immunofluorescence staining , western blotting and tumor xenograft models. The results demonstrated that DHCE treatment exerted minimal cytotoxic effects on normal cells , but markedly suppressed MCL cell proliferation by inducing G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest , and inhibited MCL cell viability by stimulating apoptosis via extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. In addition , the results revealed that DHCE suppressed cell growth and proliferation by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin complex ( mTORC) 1-mediated phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein. Simultaneously , DHCE induced apoptosis and inhibited cell survival by suppressing mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of protein kinase B and nuclear factor-ÎºB activity. In addition to in vitro findings , DHCE treatment reduced the MCL tumor burden in a xenograft mouse model , without indications of toxicity. Furthermore , combined treatment with DHCE and bortezomib , a proteasome inhibitor , induced a synergistic cytotoxic effect on MCL cells. These findings indicated that DHCE may have the potential to serve as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of MCL through dually inhibiting mTORC1 and mTORC2.
