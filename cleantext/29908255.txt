  Microcystin-leucine-arginine ( MCLR) is the most common form of microcystins , which are environmental toxins produced by cyanobacteria , and its hepatotoxicity has been well-documented. However , the neurotoxic potential of MCLR remains to be further elucidated. In the present study , we investigated whether intracerebroventricular ( i.c.v.) infusion of MCLR induces mortality and neuronal loss in the hippocampus of mice. Because we found that MCLR impairs memory function in the hippocampus at a low dose ( 4 ng/μl/mouse , i.c.v.) without a significant neuronal loss , we focused on this dose for further analyses. Results showed that MCLR ( 4 ng/μl/mouse , i.c.v.) significantly increased oxidative stress ( i.e. , malondialdehyde , protein carbonyl , and synaptosomal ROS) in the hippocampus. In addition , MCLR significantly increased superoxide dismutase ( SOD) activity without corresponding induction of glutathione peroxidase ( GPx) activity , and thus led to significant decrease in the ratio of GPx/SODs activity. The GSH/GSSG ratio was also significantly reduced after MCLR treatment. GPx-1 overexpressing transgenic mice ( GPx-1 Tg) were significantly protected from MCLR-induced memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> and oxidative stress. The DNA binding activity of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2) in these mice was significantly enhanced , and the ratios of GPx/SODs activity and GSH/GSSG returned to near control levels in the hippocampus. Importantly , memory function exhibited a significant positive correlation with the ratios of GPx/SODs activity and GSH/GSSG in the hippocampus of MCLR-treated non-transgenic ( non-Tg)- and GPx-1 Tg-mice. Combined , our results suggest that MCLR induces oxidative stress and memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> without significant neuronal loss , and that GPx-1 gene constitutes an important protectant against MCLR-induced memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> and oxidative stress via maintaining antioxidant defense system homeostasis , possibly through the induction of Nrf2 transcription factor.
