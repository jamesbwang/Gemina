  Left atrial appendage thrombus ( LAT) was an exclusion criterion in the seminal transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) trials; however , such patients do undergo TAVR in the ` real-world ' setting. This study sought to analyse outcomes after TAVR in patients with LAT or spontaneous echo contrast ( SEC). All patients undergoing TAVR at our institution between March 2009 and December 2014 were prospectively analysed. The presence of LAT or SEC was determined via a retrospective chart review. Primary outcomes included 30-day and 1-year neurological events as well as mortality. Of the 369 patients undergoing TAVR , 3.8 % ( 14) were found to have LAT and 6.8 % ( 25) were found to have SEC , and they were separately compared to patients who did not have LAT or SEC. Significant differences were noted between groups with regard to preoperative renal function , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and ejection fraction. Preoperative atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> was the only independent predictor of LAT. No perioperative complications were associated with the presence of LAT or SEC. Specifically , no patient with LAT or SEC experienced a postoperative neurological event. While neither LAT nor SEC was an independent predictor of 30-day mortality , LAT was an independent predictor of 1-year mortality ( odds ratio 3.573 , 95 % confidence interval 1.040-12.28; P = 0.042). The current study suggests that TAVR may be performed in patients with LAT and SEC with a low risk of embolic complications. While neither was an independent predictor of 30-day mortality , LAT was an independent predictor of 1-year mortality. Larger studies are needed to better study this phenomenon.
