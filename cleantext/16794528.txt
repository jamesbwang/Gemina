  Health-related quality of life ( HRQOL) among kidney transplant recipients is associated with physical and psychosocial characteristics. Furthermore , pregnancy and childcare may be particularly challenging for women. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between patients ' psychosocial characteristics and HRQOL , specifically for recipients who have given birth after their kidney transplant. This was a cross-sectional study. Participants were 59 kidney transplant recipients who had given birth after transplantation. The tools used were the Medical Outcomes Scale , the Kidney Transplantation Self-Management Scale , the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support ( MSPSS) , and The Maternal Consciousness<symptom> Scale. Mean age was 42.3 ± 7.2 years , and the mean age at the time of transplant was 28.2 ± 4.6 years. A total of 82 fetal outcomes were evaluated. Maternal age was 33.6 ± 4.1 years , duration of gestational period was 35.3 ± 3.3 weeks , and birth weight was 2,303.8 ± 592.5 g. HRQOL results were nearly the same as stratified national norms. The physical component summary was positively correlated with the MSPSS ( Self-management indirectly affects physical health through social support. To create a supportive environment through monitoring and consultation with patient families , child-rearing kidney transplant recipients should be encouraged to improve their self-management skills to improve their quality of life. Social support for self-management may contribute to improve HRQOL for women who experience pregnancy and child-rearing after transplantation.
