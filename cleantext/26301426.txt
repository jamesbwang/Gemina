  We report the coordination chemistry of indole based tripodal tetraphosphine ligands to iron ( II) , cobalt ( II) and nickel ( II). These complexes are formed by simple synthetic protocols and were characterized by a combination of spectroscopic techniques and single-crystal X-ray analysis. The molecular structures as determined by X-ray diffraction show that the geometry of the nickel and cobalt complexes are distorted trigonal bipyramidal. The monocationic iron ( II) complexes also have distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometries , but the dicationic analogue has an octahedral geometry.
