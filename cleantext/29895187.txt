  We conducted a prospective serial laboratory cohort study to assess the correlation of factor VIII ( FVIII) levels in response to thrombolysis in patients with large vessel occlusion ( LVO) and acute ischemic stroke ( AIS). Patients with AIS with anterior circulation LVO were eligible for enrollment if treated within 4.5 hours from last seen normal with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA). Patients ( n = 29) had a mean age of 71 years and median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale of 14. Baseline pre-tPA FVIII was not significantly correlated with clot burden score ( -0.147 , P = .447) or vessel recanalization ( -0.133 , P = .499). Median FVIII decreased significantly from baseline to 6 hours post-tPA ( 282 % to 161 % , P = .002) , but delta in FVIII level did not correlate with vessel recanalization ( 0.013 , P = .948). There was no difference between median FVIII level at baseline and 90 days post-AIS. FVIII level decreased significantly after tPA , but baseline FVIII level and early change in FVIII level were not significant predictors of clot burden , vessel recanalization after thrombolysis , or symptomatic
