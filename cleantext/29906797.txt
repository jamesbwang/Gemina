  We sought to validate the SunTech Medical Advantage Model 2 Series with firmware LX 3.40.8 algorithm noninvasive blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> module in a pregnant population , including those with preeclampsia. Validation study of an oscillometric noninvasive blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> module using the ANSI/AAMI ISO 81060-2:2013 standard guidelines. Pregnant women were enrolled into three subgroups: normotensive , hypertensive without proteinuria<symptom> , and preeclampsia ( hypertensive with random protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 0.3 or a 24-hour urine protein > 300 mg). Two trained research nurses , blinded to each other 's measurements , used a mercury sphygmomanometer to validate the module by following the protocol set forth in the ANSI/AAMI ISO 81060-2:2013 standard guidelines. A total of 45 patients , 15 in each subgroup , were included. The mean systolic and diastolic differences with standard deviations between the module and the mean observers ' measurements for all participants were -2.3 ± 7.3 and 0.2 ± 6.5 mm Hg , respectively. The systolic and diastolic standard deviations of the mean of the individual patient 's paired module and observers ' measurements were 6.27 and 5.98 mm Hg , respectively. The test device , relative to a mercury sphygmomanometer , underestimated the systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in patients with preeclampsia by at least 10 mm Hg in 24 % ( 11/45) of paired measurements. The SunTech Medical Advantage Model 2 Series with firmware LX 3.40.8 algorithm noninvasive blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> module is validated in pregnancy , including patients with preeclampsia; however , it may underestimate systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> measurements in patients with preeclampsia.
