  Zebrafish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPCs) originate from the hemogenic endothelium of the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta ( DA) through the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition ( EHT) from approximately 30 to 60 hours post fertilization ( hpf). However , whether other artery sites can generate HSPCs de novo remains unclear. In this study , using live imaging and lineage tracing , we found that the caudal dorsal artery ( CDA) in the caudal hematopoietic tissue directly gave rise to HSPCs through EHT. This process initiated from approximately 60 hpf and terminated at approximately 156 hpf. Compared with that in the DA , fewer EHT events were observed in the CDA. The EHT events in the DA and CDA were similarly regulated by Runx1 but differentially influenced by blood flow ( i.e. , the EHT frequency in CDA was affected to a lesser extent when circulation was compromised in the tnnt2a
