  The oral fluid microbiome comprises an important bacterial diversity , yet the presence of archaea has not been reported so far. In order to quest for the presence of methanogenic archaea ( methanogens) in oral fluid , we used a polyphasic approach including PCR-sequencing detection , microscopic observation by fluorescence in-situ hybridization , isolation and culture , molecular identification and genotyping of methanogens in 200 oral fluid specimens. In the presence of negative controls , 64/200 ( 32 %) prospectively analysed oral fluid specimens were PCR-positive for methanogens , all identified as Methanobrevibacter oralis<pathogen> by sequencing. Further , fluorescence in-situ hybridization detected methanogens in 19/48 ( 39.6 %) investigated specimens; with morphology suggesting M. oralis<pathogen> in 10 cases and co-infecting Methanobrevibacter smithii in nine cases. M. oralis<pathogen> was cultured from 46/64 ( 71.8 %) PCR-positive specimens and none of PCR-negative specimens; and one M. smithii isolate was co-cultured with M. oralis<pathogen> in one specimen. Multispacer Sequence Typing found one M. oralis<pathogen> genotype per specimen and a total of five different genotypes with 19/46 ( 41 %) of isolates all belonging to spacer-type four. Statistical analyses showed a significant correlation between the PCR-detection of methanogens in oral fluid and tobacco smoking. These data indicate that M. oralis<pathogen> and M. smithii are oral fluid-borne methanogens in tobacco smokers. Both methanogens could be transmitted during intimate contacts such as mother-to-child contacts and kissing.
