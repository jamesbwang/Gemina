  Lumbar disc herniation ( LDH) is a common spinal problem , with reoperation rates of 6 % -24 %. Although different surgical techniques are used for treatment , there is still debate regarding whether fusion techniques can reduce the reoperation rate in patients with LDH. This retrospective study used a 5-year nationwide database to analyze reoperation rates in Taiwan. Patient age groups ( ≥ 20 and < 90 years) treated by index surgery and reoperation for LDH were identified. Four surgical procedures were included in the analysis: discectomy ( DC) , anterior lumbar fusion with DC ( FA + DC) , posterior lumbar fusion ( FP) , and posterior lumbar fusion with DC ( FP + DC). There were 1743 index surgeries between 2008 and 2012 , with 184 ( 10.56 %) reoperations. Index surgery DC had the highest reoperation rate ( n = 121 , 20 %). The reoperation risk was significantly lower for patients undergoing fusion procedures ( FA + DC vs. DC ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 0.24; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.12-0.47; P < 0.01) , FP versus DC ( HR , 0.17; 95 % C , 0.09-0.33; P < 0.01) , FP + DC versus DC ( HR , 0.31; 95 % CI , 0.22-0.44; P < 0.01)). Fusion procedures had significantly higher treatment costs compared with DC ( FA + DC vs. FP vs. FP + DC vs. DC: 5851.74 ± 4808.94 vs. 5116.88 ± 3428.97 vs. 4782.16 ± 2902.19 vs. 3846.79 ± 3584.45 U.S. dollars/patient , respectively; P < 0.0001). Among surgical procedures for LDH , fusion techniques are related to lower reoperation rates compared with discectomy , but at the expense of higher medical costs.
