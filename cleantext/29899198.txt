  This Document , `` Guidelines for personal exposure monitoring of chemicals '' ( `` this Guideline '') , has been prepared by `` The Committee for Personal Exposure Monitoring '' ( `` the Committee '') of the Expert Division of Occupational Hygiene & Ergonomics , Japan Society for Occupational Health. Considering the background of the growing importance of personal exposure monitoring in risk assessment and the need to prepare for the introduction of monitoring using personal samplers from an administrative perspective in recent years , the Committee was organized in November 2012. The Committee has prepared this Guideline as a `` practical guideline '' for personal exposure monitoring , so as to offer proposals and recommendations to the members of the Japan Society for Occupational Health and to society in general. The scope of this Guideline covers all chemical substances and all related workplaces regarded as targets for general assessment and the management of risk. It thus is not to be considered to comment on legal regulations and methodology. The main text provides the basic methods and concepts of personal exposure monitoring , while 31 `` Appendices '' are provided in this Guideline throughout the series; technical descriptions , statistical bases , and actual workplace examples are provided in these appendices , to assist better understanding. The personal exposure monitoring described as per this Guideline is equivalent to an `` expert-centered basic method to reasonably proceed with the assessment and management of risk at workplaces. '' It is considered that practicing and expanding on this method will significantly contribute in reforming the overall framework of occupational hygiene management in Japan.
