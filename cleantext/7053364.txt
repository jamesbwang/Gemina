  The primary role for erythrocytes is oxygen transport that requires the reversible binding of oxygen to hemoglobin. There are , however , secondary reactions whereby the erythrocyte can generate reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and nitric oxide ( NO). ROS such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide are generated by the autoxidation of hemoglobin. NO can be generated when nitrite reacts with hemoglobin forming an HbNO
