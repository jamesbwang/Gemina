  Symbiosis with microbes is crucial for survival and development of wood-inhabiting longhorn beetles ( Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). Thus , knowledge of the endemic fungal associates of insects would facilitate risk assessment in cases where a new invasive pest occupies the same ecological niche. However , the diversity of fungi<pathogen> associated with insects remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate fungi<pathogen> associated with the native large poplar longhorn beetle ( Saperda carcharias) and the recently introduced Asian longhorn beetle ( Anoplophora glabripennis) infesting hardwood trees in Finland. We studied the cultivable fungal associates obtained from Populus tremula colonised by S. carcharias , and Betula pendula and Salix caprea infested by A. glabripennis , and compared these to the samples collected from intact wood material. This study detected a number of plant pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi<pathogen> , and species with known potential for enzymatic degradation of wood components. Phylogenetic analyses of the most commonly encountered fungi<pathogen> isolated from the longhorn beetles revealed an association with fungi<pathogen> residing in the Cadophora-Mollisia species complex. A commonly encountered fungus was Cadophora spadicis , a recently described fungus associated with wood-decay. In addition , a novel species of Cadophora , for which the name Cadophora margaritata sp. nov. is provided , was isolated from the colonised wood.
