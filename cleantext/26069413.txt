  The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of the composite material and surface treatment to the bond strength when repairing an aged composite surface with new composite. One hundred and sixty resin blocks of methacrylate composite and silorane composite prepared and aged in artificial saliva for 6 months. Specimens treated either with a diamond bur ( DB) or air abrasion ( AA) , conditioned with orthophosphoric acid ( OA) or sodium hypochloride ( SH) and repaired with methacrylate or silorane composite using the corresponding adhesive system. Repaired composites underwent thermocycling fatigue<symptom> ( Ã— 5000) , and bond strength was measured at shear. Methacrylate achieved the highest bond strengths as repair material , in all combinations ( 26.54-55.56 MPa). Silorane only reached 8.12 MPa when repairing silorane treated with DB and OA. For all other treatment combinations repairing with silorane led to pretest failures. The most susceptible to repair composites/surface treatment combination is when repairing methacrylate treated with AA and SH and methacrylate composite ( 55.56 MPa). Silorane composites are not suitable to be used when repairing an old composite restoration. The repair material is the most critical factor , while aged surface treatment has only a minor influence to the shear bond strength.
