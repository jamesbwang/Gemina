  Density-functional based tight-binding ( DFTB) is an efficient quantum mechanical method that can describe a variety of systems , going from organic and inorganic compounds to metallic and hybrid materials. The present topical review addresses the ability and performance of DFTB to investigate energetic , structural , spectroscopic and dynamical properties of gold and silver materials. After a brief overview of the theoretical basis of DFTB , its parametrization and its transferability , we report its past and recent applications to gold and silver systems , including small clusters , nanoparticles , bulk and surfaces , bare and interacting with various organic and inorganic compounds. The range of applications covered by those studies goes from plasmonics and molecular electronics , to energy conversion and surface chemistry. Finally , perspectives of DFTB in the field of gold and silver surfaces and NPs are outlined.
