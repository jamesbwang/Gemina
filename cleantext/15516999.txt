  Metabolic dysfunction related to diet-induced obesity has recently been linked to the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). However , the underlying mechanisms linking obesity and AD remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine early alterations in brain insulin signaling , inflammatory/stress markers , and energetic stress in a model of diet-induced obesity during middle age. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomized to either a control diet ( AGE n = 12) or high-fat and sucrose diet ( AGE-HFS n = 12) for 13-weeks from 20-weeks of age. Prefrontal cortex and hippocampal samples were collected at 20-weeks of age ( BSL n = 11) and at 33-weeks of age ( AGE and AGE-HFS). The HFS diet resulted in increased body<symptom> weight ( 30 %; P = 0.0001) , increased t mass ( 28 %; P = 0.0001) , and decreased % lean mass ( 33 %; P = 0.0001) compared to aged controls. In the prefrontal cortex , AGE-HFS resulted in increased 5 ' adenosine monophosphate- activated protein kinase ( AMPK) phosphorylation ( P = 0.045). In the hippocampus , AGE-HFS resulted in increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK) phosphorylation and protein kinase B ( Akt) serine473 and glycogen synthase kinase ( GSK) phosphorylation ( P < 0.05). Results from this study demonstrate that aging combined with a HFS diet results in increased inflammation<symptom> ( pERK and pJNK) and energetic stress ( pAMPK) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex , respectively. Together these novel results provide important information for future targets in early AD pathogenesis.
