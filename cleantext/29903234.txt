  To study the neurotoxicity and mechanism of polychlorinated biphenyl ( PCB) in BV-2 cells. The experiment was divided into control group and PCB118 , 138 , 153 , 180 treated group , the dosages were 0. 000 , 0. 015 , 0. 030 , 0. 050 , 0. 100 , 0. 150 μmol/L. Through the statistical analysis of the survival rate of the cells , the final dose was divided into low , middle and high dose levels. Among them , the high dose group except PCB118 was 0. 15 μmol/L , the PCB138 , 153 , 180 concentration was 0. 015 , 0. 05 and 0. 1 μmol/L for the low , medium and high dose groups. In vitro culture of mouse microglia cells with different doses of PCB after exposure , CCK-8 method to detect cell growth and viabilities; FITC Annexin V/PI method to detect cell apoptosis rate; detection of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) release by ELISA kit; fluorescence probe method ( Fluo-4 AM) to detect the intracellular calcium content changes. CCK-8 and FITC Annexin V/PI double staining experiments showed that PCB118 , 138 , 153 , 180 could inhibit cell activity , and with the increase in dose , cell survival rate decreased , apoptosis rate increased. PCB118 dose in 0. 15 μmol/L toxicity increased , cytoactive was reduced to ( 66. 56 ± 0. 10) % , apoptosis rate increased to ( 27. 39 ± 1. 80) %; PCB138 , 153 in 0. 1 μmol/L cell survival rate reached ( 66. 66 ± 0. 10) % and ( 67. 17 ± 0. 12) % , apoptosis rate reached ( 48. 77 ± 2. 43) % and ( 56. 42 ± 3. 59) %; PCB180 dose of 0. 015μmol/L cell survival rate reached ( 92. 07 ± 0. 38) % , cell apoptosis rate was ( 6. 82 ± 0. 51) % , significantly higher than that of the control group , the difference was statistically significant ( P < 0. 05). LDH assay showed that the release amount of LDH was proportional to the dose of PCB. The lactate dehydrogenase amounts of PCB118 , 138 , 153 and 180 were ( 523. 78 ± 13. 58) U/L , ( 430. 37 ± 22. 03) U/L , ( 540. 58 ± 13. 08) U/L , ( 411. 88 ± 21. 92) U/L , which were significantly higher than those in the control group , the difference was statistically significant ( P < 0. 05). The result of Fluo-4 and AM showed that the average fluorescence intensity of intracellular calcium ( Ca ~ ( 2 +)) in PCB exposed group increased obviously. The average fluorescence intensity of Ca ~ ( 2 +) in the PCB118 , 138 , 153 and 180 groups was ( 10. 14 ± 2. 36) , ( 32. 47 ± 1. 56) , ( 16. 54 ± 0. 97) and ( 40. 46 ± 2. 19) when the dose was 0. 015 μmol/L , significantly higher than that of the control group , the difference was statistically significant ( P < 0. 05). PCB could cause neurotoxicity damage , increase LDH , destroy cell membrane integrity , induce the balance<symptom> disorder of cell calcium and lead to the cell apoptosis.
