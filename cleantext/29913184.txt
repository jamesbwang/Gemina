  Iron oxide ( IO) nanocolloids are being increasingly used to image cellular contribution to neuroinflammation using MRI , as these particles are capable of labeling circulating cells with phagocytic activity , allowing to assess cell trafficking from the blood<symptom> to neuroinflammation sites. The use of IOs relies on the natural phagocytic properties of immune cells , allowing their labeling either in vitro or directly in vivo , following intravenous injection. Despite concerns on the specificity of the latter approach , the widespread availability and relatively low cost of these techniques , coupled to a sensitivity that allows to reach single cell detection , have promoted their use in several preclinical and clinical studies. In this review , we discuss the results of currently available preclinical and clinical IO-enhanced MRI studies of immune cell trafficking in neuroinflammation , examining the specificity of the existing findings , in view of the different possible mechanisms underlying IO accumulation in the brain. From this standpoint , we assess the implications of the temporal and spatial differences in the enhancement pattern of IOs , compared to gadolinium-based contrast agents , a clinically established MRI marker blood-brain barrier breakdown. While concerns on the specificity of cell labeling obtained using the in-vivo labeling approach still need to be fully addressed , these techniques have indeed proved able to provide additional information on neuroinflammatory phenomena , as compared to conventional Gadolinium-enhanced MRI.
