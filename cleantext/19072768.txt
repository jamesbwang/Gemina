  Gadolinium-based contrast agents are widely used as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging. Since gadolinium ions are toxic , many chelators are developed to bind gadolinium ions to prevent free gadolinium-associated disease. However , many reports indicated that linear chelator-based contrast agents are associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis<disease> ( NSF) in patients with low kidney function. Therefore , the demand for stable macrocyclic chelator-based contrast agent is now increasing. 1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetate ( DOTA) was conjugated to lactobionic acid ( LBA) through DCC-NHS coupling reaction. Gd This new macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent showed enhanced in vitro paramagnetic properties compared to Gadovist. In addition , Gd-DOTA-LAE showed a 29 % increased contrast enhancement of tumor tissue compared to normal tissue within 20 min past IV injection. We developed a new macrocyclic T1-weighted MR contrast agent. This new contrast agent offers various opportunities for cancer detection and diagnosis.
