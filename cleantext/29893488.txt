  To investigate the effects of semaglutide vs placebo on glucagon and other counterregulatory hormones during hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes ( T2D). In this double-blind , placebo-controlled , single-centre trial , we randomized 38 men and women ( treated only with metformin) 1:1 to 2 12-week crossover periods of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide or placebo , each followed by a hypoglycaemic clamp procedure. The primary endpoint was change in glucagon concentration from target plasma glucose ( PG) level 5.5 mmol/L to nadir ( target 2.5 mmol/L). The mean ( range) participant age was 54.2 ( 41-64) years , body mass index 29.4 ( 23.3-36.1) kg/m Semaglutide treatment did not compromise the counterregulatory glucagon response during experimental hypoglycaemia in people with T2D.
