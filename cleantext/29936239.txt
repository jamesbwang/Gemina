  Strategies to increase the availability of cognitive behaviour therapy ( CBT) for severe health anxiety<symptom> ( SHA) are needed , and this study investigated the cost-effectiveness and long-term efficacy of three forms of minimal-contact CBT for SHA. We hypothesised that therapist-guided internet CBT ( G-ICBT) , unguided internet CBT ( U-ICBT) , and cognitive behavioural bibliotherapy ( BIB-CBT) would all be more cost-effective than a waiting-list condition ( WLC) , as assessed over the main phase of the trial. We also hypothesised that improvements would remain stable up to one-year follow-up. Adults ( N = 132) with principal SHA were randomised to 12 weeks of G-ICBT , U-ICBT , BIB-CBT , or WLC. The primary measure of cost-effectiveness was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio , or the between-group difference in per capita costs divided by the between-group difference in proportion of participants in remission. The Health anxiety<symptom> inventory ( HAI) was the primary efficacy outcome. G-ICBT , U-ICBT , and BIB-CBT were more cost-effective than the WLC. Over the follow-up period , the G-ICBT and BIB-CBT groups made further improvements in health anxiety<symptom> , whereas the U-ICBT group did not change. As expected , all three treatments were cost-effective with persistent long-term effects. CBT without therapist support appears to be a valuable alternative to G-ICBT for scaling up treatment for SHA.
