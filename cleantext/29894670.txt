  The muscle membrane , sarcolemma , must be firmly attached to the basal lamina. The failure of proper attachment results in muscle injury , which is the underlying cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD) , in which mutations in the dystrophin gene disrupts the firm adhesion. In patients with DMD , even moderate contraction causes damage , leading to progressive muscle degeneration. The damaged muscles are repaired through myogenesis. Consequently , myogenesis is highly active in patients with DMD , and the repeated activation of myogenesis leads to the exhaustion<symptom> of the myogenic stem cells. Therefore , approaches to reducing the risk of the exhaustion<symptom> are to develop a treatment that strengthens the interaction between the sarcolemma and the basal lamina and increases the efficiency of the myogenesis. Galectin-3 is an oligosaccharide-binding protein and is known to be involved in cell-cell interactions and cell-matrix interactions. Galectin-3 is expressed in myoblasts and skeletal muscle , although its function in muscle remains elusive. In this study , we found evidence that galectin-3 and the monosaccharide N-acetylglucosamine , which increases the synthesis of binding partners ( oligosaccharides) of galectin-3 , promote myogenesis in vitro. Moreover , in the mdx mouse model of DMD , treatment with N-acetylglucosamine increased muscle-force production. The results suggest that treatment with N-acetylglucosamine might mitigate the burden of DMD.-Rancourt , A. , Dufresne , S S. , St-Pierre , G. , LÃ©vesque , J.-C. , Nakamura , H. , Kikuchi , Y. , Satoh , M.
