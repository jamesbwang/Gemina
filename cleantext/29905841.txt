  Neurocysticercosis ( NCC) is an infectious helminthic disease often presenting in patients who have immigration or travel history from areas where NCC is endemic. Fourth ventricle cysts<symptom> from NCC pose a unique treatment challenge , as there is little consensus on the best treatment. This case study describes the treatment of a patient with fourth ventricle neurocysticercosis ( FVNCC) , examines the therapeutic decision-making , and provides a video of a posterior fossa craniotomy ( PFC) resection of a degenerative cyst<symptom>. The patient presented with headache<symptom> , dizziness<symptom> , nausea<symptom> , and memory difficulties. A fourth ventricle cyst<symptom> consistent with NCC was found on magnetic resonance imaging , and serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) confirmed the diagnosis. The cyst<symptom> was removed utilizing an open PFC followed by antihelminthic therapy and corticosteroids. There was resolution of symptoms at 9 mo postoperatively. Several treatment modalities have been proposed for isolated cysts<symptom> in the fourth ventricle , including medication , ventriculoperitoneal shunt , endoscopic removal , and PFC. The treatment decision is complex , and there is little guidance on the best treatment choices. In this article , we describe treatment via PFC for an adherent FVNCC
