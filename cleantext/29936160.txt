  Impacts of floods on human society have been drawing increasing human concerns in recent years. In this study , flood observations from EM-DAT ( Emergency Events Database) and DFO ( Dartmouth Flood Observatory) datasets were analyzed to investigate frequency and intensity of floods , and flood-induced mortality , flood-affected population as well during 1975-2016 across the globe. Results indicated that: ( 1) occurrence rate of floods , flood-induced mortality and flood-affected population were generally increasing globally. However , flood-induced mortality and flood-affected people per flood event were in slight decrease , indicating that flood-induced mortality and flood-affected people due to increased floods exceeded those by individual flood event; ( 2) annual variation of mortality per flood event is highly related to floods with higher intensity. Specifically , the flood frequency and flood-induced mortality are the largest in Asia , specifically in China , India , Indonesia and Philippine; while significantly increased flood-affected population and mean annual mortality was detected in China , USA and Australia; ( 3) tropical cyclones ( TC) are closely related to flood-induced mortality in parts of the countries along the western coast of the oceans. The frequency of channel floods in these regions is the largest and large proportion of flood-induced deaths and the highest flood-induced mortality can be attributed to TC-induced flash floods; ( 4) Population density and GDP per unit area are in significantly positive correlation with the number of flood-related victims per unit area , number of deaths and economic losses with exception of low-income countries. However , the flood-affected population and flood-induced mortality increase with decrease of per capita GDP; while the per capita economic loss increases with the increase of per capita GDP , indicating that the higher the population density and GDP per unit for a region , the higher sensitivity of this area to flood hazards.
