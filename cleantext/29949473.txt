  Background Postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> is the most common cause of maternal death. Oxytocin is the standard therapy for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> , but it requires cold storage , which is not available in many countries. In a large trial , we compared a novel formulation of heat-stable carbetocin with oxytocin. Methods We enrolled women across 23 sites in 10 countries in a randomized , double-blind , noninferiority trial comparing intramuscular injections of heat-stable carbetocin ( at a dose of 100 μg) with oxytocin ( at a dose of 10 IU) administered immediately after vaginal birth. Both drugs were kept in cold storage ( 2 to 8 °C) to maintain double-blinding. There were two primary outcomes: the proportion of women with blood<symptom> loss<symptom> of at least 500 ml or the use of additional uterotonic agents , and the proportion of women with blood<symptom> loss<symptom> of at least 1000 ml. The noninferiority margins for the relative risks of these outcomes were 1.16 and 1.23 , respectively. Results A total of 29,645 women underwent randomization. The frequency of blood<symptom> loss<symptom> of at least 500 ml or the use of additional uterotonic agents was 14.5 % in the carbetocin group and 14.4 % in the oxytocin group ( relative risk , 1.01; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.95 to 1.06) , a finding that was consistent with noninferiority. The frequency of blood<symptom> loss<symptom> of at least 1000 ml was 1.51 % in the carbetocin group and 1.45 % in the oxytocin group ( relative risk , 1.04; 95 % CI , 0.87 to 1.25) , with the confidence interval crossing the margin of noninferiority. The use of additional uterotonic agents , interventions to stop bleeding , and adverse effects did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusions Heat-stable carbetocin was noninferior to oxytocin for the prevention of blood<symptom> loss<symptom> of at least 500 ml or the use of additional uterotonic agents. Noninferiority was not shown for the outcome of blood<symptom> loss<symptom> of at least 1000 ml; low event rates for this outcome reduced the power of the trial.
