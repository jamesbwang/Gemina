  The prevalence of hepatitis<pathogen> E<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HEV<pathogen>) in domestic swine threats the public health , due to the risk of zoonotic transmission. In this study , we investigated the prevalence and genetic features of HEV<pathogen> in swine , in Gansu , which is geographically an important province in China. 377 fecal samples were collected from pig farms in Gansu province of China and tested for HEV<pathogen> RNA by RT-PCR. The prevalence rate is about 23 % in pig farms of Gansu province. By RT-nPCR , 5 ' and 3 ' RACE methods , a whole genome with 7,284 nt in length , termed as swCH189 , was obtained and investigated by nucleotide , codon and amino acid usage analyses. Phylogenetic tree analysis classified swCH189 strain into genotype 4e. Although this subtype has never been reported in the local population , genotype 4 is known as zoonotic and more pathogenic than other genotypes. According to the synonymous codon usage patterns of the three open reading frames ( ORFs) of swCH189 , compositional constraint mainly influences usage patterns of synonymous codons with A-end , while natural selections dominate in usage patterns of synonymous codons with G , C and U-ends. Genetic diversities of each ORFs , in respect to codon and amino acid usage patterns , are closely related to other members of genotype 4 in general , but with distinct features. Thus , the prevalence rate and the genetic features of HEV<pathogen> determined by this study are important for the prevention of zoonotic transmission of HEV<pathogen> from swine to human in this region as well as in China.
