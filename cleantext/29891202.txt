  Radiation injury to the bronchial tree is an important yet poorly understood potential side effect in lung stereotactic ablative radiation therapy ( SAbR). We investigate the integration of virtual bronchoscopy in radiation therapy planning to quantify dosage to individual airways. We develop a risk model of airway collapse and develop treatment plans that reduce the risk of radiation-induced airway injury. Pre- and post-SAbR diagnostic-quality computerized tomography ( CT) scans were retrospectively collected from 26 lung cancer patients. From each scan , the bronchial tree was segmented using a virtual bronchoscopy system and registered deformably to the planning CT.. Univariate and stepwise multivariate Cox regressions were performed , examining factors such as age , comorbidities , smoking pack years , airway diameter , and maximum point dosage ( D Univariate analysis showed that segmental diameter ( P = .014) and D To our knowledge , this is the first systematic investigation of functional avoidance in lung SAbR based on mapping and minimizing doses to individual bronchial segments. Our early results show that it is possible to substantially lower airway dosage. Such dosage reduction may potentially reduce the risk of radiation-induced airway injury , while satisfying clinically prescribed dosimetric objectives.
