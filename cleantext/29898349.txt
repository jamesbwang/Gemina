Females had better knowledge ( p < 0.001) , attitudes ( p < 0.05) than males towards use of physical restraints. Nurses those had more than ten years of experience found to have more favorable attitudes towards using physical restraints than nurses with less experience ( p < 0.05) and nurses with higher education differed significantly on practice score than nurses with basic education in nursing ( p < 0.05). This study revealed good knowledge , positive attitudes and good practices among nurses about using physical restraints in mental health services.
