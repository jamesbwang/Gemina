  Treatment of large bone defects caused by trauma , osteomyelitis<disease> , and tumors has been a major challenge in clinical. In the past , there have been many ways to repair and reconstruct the large bone defects. However , there is a long period of treatment , high technical requirement and complications such as ununion. After Masquelet reported the induced membrane technology in 2000 , the technique was widely used in treatment of trauma , osteomyelitis<disease> , and large bone defects caused by tumors. It has been obtained good results. It has the advantages of short course , high healing rate , easy operation and easy to master. The induced membrane has unique structural characteristics and biological characteristics. There are many kinds of osteogenic factors that are included in the membrane , such as vascular endothelial growth factor , and morphogenetic protein-2 , transforming growth factor-Î²1 , etc.. These osteogenic factors contribute to accelerate bone healing. With the development of induced membrane technology. The technology of Reamer Irrigator Aspirator technology , engineering tissue technology and internal fixation is used in clinic.It can provide bone source , promote bone defect reconstruction , improve long-term limb function and reduce complications.This paper retrospectively summarizes the experimental research and clinical progress of Masquelet technique in the treatment of large bone defects.
