  Macromolecular crowding has a profound impact on reaction rates and the physical properties of the cell interior , but the mechanisms that regulate crowding are poorly understood. We developed genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles ( GEMs) to dissect these mechanisms. GEMs are homomultimeric scaffolds fused to a fluorescent protein that self-assemble into bright , stable particles of defined size and shape. By combining tracking of GEMs with genetic and pharmacological approaches , we discovered that the mTORC1 pathway can modulate the effective diffusion coefficient of particles ≥ 20 nm in diameter more than 2-fold by tuning ribosome concentration , without any discernable effect on the motion of molecules ≤ 5 nm. This change in ribosome concentration affected phase separation both in vitro and in vivo. Together , these results establish a role for mTORC1 in controlling both the mesoscale biophysical properties of the cytoplasm and biomolecular condensation.
