  To assess the risk of stroke ( and subtypes of stroke) in women after elective bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at hysterectomy for benign diseases. We conducted a nationwide population-based , retrospective cohort study using claims data from Taiwan 's National Health Insurance program between 1997 and 2013. Women aged 20 years or more who underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at hysterectomy for benign diseases ( n = 1083) were compared with women who did not undergo bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at hysterectomy for benign diseases ( n = 3903). The follow-up period ranged from 10 to 16 years. Age-adjusted ( or unadjusted) and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the risk of stroke between the two groups. A diagnosis of stroke ( and subtypes of stroke). We did not find a significant association between bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and the risk of incident stroke ( or subtypes of stroke) over an average follow-up of 13 years. Among women aged 50 years or more who used estrogen therapy , the risk of developing stroke was 64 % lower in those who had undergone bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ( hazard ratio , 0.36; 95 % confidence interval , 0.16-0.79) than in those who had undergone hysterectomy only. This study suggests that the use of estrogen after bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at hysterectomy for benign diseases reduces the risk of stroke in women aged 50 years or more.
