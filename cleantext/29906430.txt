  Comparative evaluation of complications and visual outcomes following bilateral congenital cataract surgery in children up to 2 years of age with and without primary intraocular lens ( IOL) implantation at 5 years follow-up. Randomized controlled clinical trial. Sixty children ( 120 eyes) up to 2 years of age undergoing bilateral congenital cataract surgery were randomized to Group 1 , primary aphakia ( n = 30) , or Group 2 , primary IOL implantation ( pseudophakia) ( n = 30). A single surgeon performed surgeries with identical surgical technique. All patients were followed up regularly until 5 years postoperatively. At each follow-up , glaucoma , visual axis obscuration ( VAO) requiring surgery , and inflammation<symptom> ( cell deposits , posterior synechiae) were assessed. Visual acuity was assessed until 5 years follow-up. The first operated eye was selected for statistical analysis. Median age of the patients at time of surgery was 5.11 months ( aphakia group) and 6.01 months ( pseudophakia group) ( P = .56). Five years postoperatively , incidence of glaucoma was 16 % and 13.8 % in Groups 1 and 2 ( P = .82). Incidence of posterior synechiae was significantly higher in the pseudophakia group ( 27.6 %) compared to the aphakia group ( 8 %) ( P = .004). VAO requiring surgery was seen in 8 % and 10.3 % of eyes in Groups 1 and 2 ( P = .76). Mean logMAR visual acuity at 5 years follow-up was 0.59 ± 0.33 and 0.5 ± 0.23 in Groups 1 and 2 , respectively ( P = .79). However , more eyes in the pseudophakic group started giving documentable vision earlier in their postoperative follow-ups. Incidence of postoperative complications was comparable between the groups , except for a higher incidence of posterior synechiae in pseudophakic eyes. Visual rehabilitation was faster in the pseudophakic group.
