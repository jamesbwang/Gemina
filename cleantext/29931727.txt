  The aim of this study was to assess insulin non-adherence among patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM) to better understand relationships between adherence , basal insulin ( BI) usage , and patient experiences. A cross-sectional survey of patients with T2DM using BI was conducted. Adherence was measured by the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale 8-Items ( MMAS-8). Low adherence ( LA) was defined as MMAS-8 score < 6 , high adherence ( HA) as MMAS-8 score = 8 , and medium adherence as MMAS-8 score = 6 to < 8. Patients with MMAS-8 scores = 6 to < 8 were excluded from the analysis. Of 400 completed surveys , 395 patients ( 98.8 %) completed all MMAS-8 items , 112 with LA , 134 with HA. Compared with HA patients , greater proportions of LA patients followed more complex BI dosing patterns ( 57.1 % vs. 39.5 % , P = 0.014) , had some difficulty calculating their correct BI dose ( 40.2 % vs. 6.8 % , P < 0.001) , reported having missed â‰¥ 1 dose per month ( 79.3 % vs. 12.6 % , P < 0.001) , and temporarily stopped BI in the past year ( 23.2 % vs. 0.7 % , P < 0.001). In conclusion , understanding patients ' experiences with BI therapy can help formulate strategies to improve adherence.
