  While there remains limited intervention to address the damage to the developing brain , current multidisciplinary management of cerebral palsy ( CP) needs to minimise the impact of secondary musculoskeletal complications. A focus on comorbidities to maximise function for activity and participation by supporting the child and family in their environment is required. Comprehensive clinical guidance was published by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE) earlier this year. This article aims to provide a practical clinical approach to the child and family based on: ( 1) art: empathy , listening and weighing up the clinical picture of the child and family in context; diagnosis , the need for support and space; and care coordination at the right time; and ( 2) science: the current science in CP care is rapidly expanding in terms of plasticity , pathophysiology , functional assessments and treatments.
