  Serum thyroglobulin ( TG) is used to monitor for recurrence or progression of differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC). The role of preoperative TG measurement is more ambiguous , yet still being used in some centers. We aimed to determine whether preoperative TG correlates with disease stage or metastatic burden. A retrospective review of patients with TG measured before thyroidectomy was conducted. Data collected included demographics , preoperative TG , pathology , and cancer stage. Associations between preoperative TG levels and size of largest malignant nodule<disease> , thyroid gland size , stage of cancer , and presence of metastasis using Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Spearman correlations were performed. Receiver operator curve ( ROC) was generated for metastasis status. Of 598 patients , we excluded those with positive TG antibodies ( n = 176); 422 patients were included in the final analysis. Median age was 55 years and 76 % were female. Of 78 % with malignancy , papillary thyroid cancer was the most frequent ( 92 %). 18 % had TG levels > 500 ng/mL and 29 % < 45 ng/mL. 4 % had distant metastasis and 18 % had lymph node metastasis. Median follow-up was 52 months. Significant positive correlations between preoperative TG and thyroid size ( rho 0.49 , p < 0.001) , and malignant nodule<disease> size ( rho 0.27 , p < 0.001). Using a cut-off of 500 ng/mL , sensitivity to detect metastasis was 10.3 % ( 95 % CI 2.5-18.2) , specificity 90.0 % ( 95 % CI 86.0-93.9). The area under curve for ROC ( 0.46 , 95 % CI 0.38-0.54) indicated poor diagnostic ability for metastasis. Although preoperative TG correlated significantly with the size of the gland and T stage , there was no correlation with metastasis. Preoperative TG is of limited utility in today 's value-based healthcare environment.
