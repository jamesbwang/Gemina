  The proteins S100A9 and S100A12 are associated with the human S100 calcium-binding protein family. These proteins promote interaction with target proteins and alter their conformation when they bind to calcium ions in EF-hand motifs. The V domain of RAGE ( Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products) is crucial for S100A9 binding. The binding of RAGE with S100 family proteins aids in cell proliferation. In this report , we demonstrate that S100A12 protein hinders the binding of S100A9 with the RAGE V-domain. We used fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy to analyze the interaction of S100A9 with S100A12. The binary complex models of S100A9-S100A12 were developed using data obtained from 1H-15N HSQC NMR titrations and the HADDOCK program. We overlaid the complex models of S100A9-S100A12 with the same orientation of S100A9 and the RAGE V-domain. This complex showed that S100A12 protein blocks the interaction between S100A9 and the RAGE V-domain. It means S100A12 may be used as an antagonist for S100A9. The results could be favorable for developing anti-cancer drugs based on S100 family proteins.
