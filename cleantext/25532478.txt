  Zoledronic acid is regarded as the most potent bisphosphonate and is widely used in patients with osteoporosis; however , its side effects , including acute-phase reactions , gastrointestinal complaints , renal dysfunction and bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis impair the safety and quality of life of patients. The present study was designed to determine the minimal effective concentration of zoledronic acid through testing the dose-dependent effects of zoledronic acid on osteoclast suppression. A primary culture of bone<disease> marrow mononuclear cells obtained from C57 mice ( age , 6 weeks) was established and induced to form osteoclasts. The number of multinuclear cells was determined by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and compared among cultured marrow cells treated with different concentrations of zoledronic acid. Furthermore , the cellular properties , including adhesion , migration and bone resorption , were compared at the minimal effective concentration. At a concentration of 1 Ã— 10
