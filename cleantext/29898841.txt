  Medicare utilizes 30-day risk-standardized readmission rates ( RSRR) as a measure of hospital quality and applies penalties based on this measure. The objective of this study was to identify the relationship between hospital performance on 30-day RSRR in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) patients and long-term patient survival. Data were collected from Get With The Guidelines ( GWTG)- HF and linked with Medicare data. Based on hospital performance for 30-day RSRR , hospitals were grouped into performance quartiles: top 25 % ( N = 11,181) , 25-50 % ( N = 10,367) , 50-75 % ( N = 8729) , and bottom 25 % ( N = 7180). The primary outcome was mortality at 3 years applying Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for patient and hospital characteristics. The overall 30-day readmission rate was 19.8 % and the 3-year mortality rates were 61.8 % , 61.0 % , 62.6 % , and 59.9 % for top 25 % , 25-50 % , 50-75 % , and bottom 25 % hospitals for 30-day RSRR performance , respectively. Compared to bottom 25 % performing hospitals , adjusted hazard ratios ( HR) for 3-year mortality were HR 0.96 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.90-1.01) , HR 0.89 ( 95 % CI 0.84-0.94) , HR 1.01 ( 95 % CI 0.95-1.06) for the top 25 % , 25-50 % and 50-75 % hospitals respectively. Median survival time was highest for the bottom 25 % hospitals on the 30-day RSRR metric. Hospital performance on 30-day readmissions in HF has no or little association with risk adjusted 3-year mortality or median survival. There is a compelling need to utilize more meaningful and patient-centered outcome measures for reporting and incentivizing quality care for HF.
