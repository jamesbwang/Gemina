  Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms<disease> is associated with higher rates of recurrence and retreatment , though contemporary rates and risk factors for basilar tip aneurysms<disease> ( BTAs) are less well-described. To characterize progression , retreatement , and retreated progression of BTAs treated with microsurgical or endovascular interventions. We retrospectively reviewed records for 141 consecutive BTA patients. We included 158 anterior communicating artery ( ACoA) and 118 middle cerebral artery ( MCA) aneurysms<disease> as controls. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to calculate rates of progression ( recurrence of previously obliterated aneurysms<disease> and progression of known residual aneurysm<disease> dome or neck) , retreatment , and retreated progression. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to characterize 24-mo event rates for primary outcome prediction. Of 141 BTA patients , 62.4 % were ruptured and 37.6 % were unruptured. Average radiographical follow-up was 33 mo.. Among ruptured aneurysms<disease> treated with clipping , there were 2 rehemorrhages due to recurrence ( 6.1 %) , and none in any other cohorts. Overall rates of progression ( 28.9 %) , retreatment ( 28.9 %) , and retreated progression ( 24.7 %) were not significantly different between surgical and endovascular subgroups , though ruptured aneurysms<disease> had higher event rates. Multivariate modeling confirmed rupture status ( P = .003 , hazard ratio = 0.14) and aneurysm<disease> dome width ( P = .005 , hazard ratio = 1.23) as independent predictors of progression requiring retreatment. In a separate multivariate analysis with ACoA and MCA aneurysms<disease> , basilar tip location was an independent predictor of progression , retreatment , and retreated progression. BTAs have higher rates of progression and retreated progression than other aneurysm<disease> locations , independent of treatment modality. Rupture status and dome width are risk factors for progression requiring retreatment.
