  In this paper , we propose a sentiment-based approach to investigate the temporal and spatiotemporal effects on tourists ' emotions when visiting a city 's tourist destinations. Our approach consists of four steps: data collection and preprocessing from social media; visitor origin identification; visit sentiment identification; and temporal and spatiotemporal analysis. The temporal and spatiotemporal dimensions include day of the year , season of the year , day of the week , location sentiment progression , enjoyment measure , and multi-location sentiment progression. We apply this approach to the city of Chicago using over eight million tweets. Results show that seasonal weather , as well as special days and activities like concerts , impact tourists ' emotions. In addition , our analysis suggests that tourists experience greater levels of enjoyment in places such as observatories rather than zoos. Finally , we find that local and international visitors tend to convey negative sentiment when visiting more than one attraction in a day whereas the opposite holds for out of state visitors.
