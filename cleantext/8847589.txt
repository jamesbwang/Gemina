  The aim of the study was to explore anterior interhemispheric approach microsurgery for removing large sellar region tumors.A total of 118 patients with large sellar region tumors were treated with the anterior interhemispheric approach microsurgery. There were 58 craniopharyngioma , 37 pituitary adenoma , 5 hypothalamic glioma , 7 meningioma , and 11 other tumors cases. The maximal tumor diameter ranged from 3.0 to 8.2 cm , with a mean diameter of 4.3 cm. Diabetes insipidus and fluid and electrolyte imbalance were timely controlled after surgery. Postoperative examination of endocrine and of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) enhancement scanning of the head were performed.Total , subtotal , and partial removal of tumors was , respectively , achieved in 80 , 23 , and 15 cases. A total of 109 patients had improved vision after surgery. During the hospital stay , 81 had diabetes insipidus , 68 had fluid and electrolyte imbalance , and 9 had hemorrhage<symptom> and tumidness in the right frontal lobe ( 3 had frontal lobe contusion , and 6 had frontal lobe hematoma). The postoperative follow-up visit lasted for 3 to 105 months. During the follow-up period , 14 patients had recurrence of tumors , 38 cases had their single or multiple pituitary axis treated with hormonal replacement therapy for a long time after surgery , and 23 cases had to orally take drugs for the purpose of controlling diabetes insipidus.The anterior interhemispheric approach microsurgery is feasible for removing large sellar region tumors without significant sequels. Active postoperative managements of diabetes insipidus and fluid and electrolyte imbalance may help patients with earlier recovery.
