  To determine the effect on strong ion difference of citrate as an anticoagulant during continuous veno-venous hemofiltration ( CVVH). ICU patients with renal<symptom> failure<symptom> and CVVH were included. Patients were treated with either nadroparin ( N) or sodium citrate ( C) as an anticoagulant. Strong ion difference ( SID) apparent ( SIDa) and SID effective ( SIDe) and strong ion gap ( SIG) were calculated at t = 0 and t = 24 h. Citrate concentration was measured in the citrate treated patients. Ten patients with N and nine with C were included. In both groups the SIDa did not change significantly. SIG decreased significantly with N ( 11.4 ± 4.2 to 4.0 ± 3.1 meq/l; p = 0.005) but not with C ( 9.3 ± 1.9 to 8.1 ± 2.4 meq/l; p = 0.097). The decrease was significantly greater for N compared to C; p = 0.014. This is reflected by the SIDe which increased significantly ( p = 0.022) more from 24.7 ± 4.5 to 32.9 ± 3.9 ( p = 0.005) for N and from 26.3 ± 5.8 to 29.6 ± 1.6 for C ( p = 0.058). Citrate anticoagulation results in a persistently high SIG during CVVH compared to nadroparin. This is associated with the presence of unmeasured anions such as citrate in the systemic circulation.
