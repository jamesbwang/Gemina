  The clinical diagnosis of traumatic brain injury ( TBI) is based on neurological examination and neuro-imaging tools such as CT scanning and MRI. However , neurological examination at times may be confounded by consumption of alcohol or drugs and neuroimaging facilities may not be available at all centers. Human ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase ( UCHL1) is a well-accepted serum biomarker for severe TBI and can be used to detect the severity of a head injury. A reliable , rapid , cost effective , bedside and easy to perform method for the detection of UCHL1 is a pre-requisite for wide clinical applications of UCHL1 as a TBI biomarker. We developed a rapid detection method for UCHL1 using surface plasmon resonance of gold nanoparticles with a limit of detection ( LOD) of 0.5 ng mL-1. It has a sensitivity and specificity of 100 % each and meets an analytical precision similar to that of conventional sandwich ELISA but can be performed rapidly. Using this method we successfully detected UCHL1 in a cohort of 66 patients with TBI and were reliably able to distinguish mild TBI from moderate to severe TBI.
