  In 2015 , the American Council for Academic Physical Therapy ( ACAPT) developed 3 strategic initiative panels to address integrated clinical education , student readiness , and common terminology for physical therapist clinical education. The purpose of this paper is to describe the results of the work from the common terminology panel. This was a descriptive , consensus-based study. Using a consensus process and data that were collected from a review of literature , a document analysis of core and historical professional documents , focus group discussions , and an online open-comment period , panel members developed a glossary for physical therapist clinical education. The final glossary included 34 terms in 4 categories. The categories included clinical education infrastructure , sites , stakeholders , and assessment. The ACAPT Board of Directors approved the glossary in June 2017 , and the ACAPT membership approved the glossary in October 2017. The focus of the glossary was on physical therapist clinical education. A future , similar project should be undertaken for physical therapist assistant clinical education. This process resulted in a comprehensive glossary for physical therapist clinical education; changes to several current terms , including `` internship '' and `` full-time clinical education experience ''; and the addition of new terms , including `` preceptor '' and `` site coordinator for clinical education. '' New terminology will provide standard language for consistent communication and a common framework for all stakeholders.
