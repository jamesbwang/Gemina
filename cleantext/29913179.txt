  Youth initiation with one tobacco product is associated with risk of using additional tobacco types. How use of one product potentially encourages use of others could result from changing tobacco-related perceptions. This study aimed to evaluate how tobacco product initiation correlates with changes in susceptibility ( curiosity and willingness) and perceived harm of other tobacco products. For each of cigarettes , e-cigarettes , hookah , and smokeless tobacco , youth ( ages 12-16; N = 8005) rated perceived harm , curiosity , and willingness to try in Waves 1 and 2 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health ( United States , 2013-2015). For each product , we estimated associations between decreased harm rating , increased curiosity , or increased willingness with initiation ( from never- to ever-use) of cigarettes , e-cigarettes , hookah , smokeless tobacco , or other combustible products using multivariate ( multiple outcomes) regression , adjusting for other tobacco risk factors. Tobacco product initiation was associated with decreased perceived harm for that product and with decreased perceived harm , increased curiosity , and increased willingness in some , but not all , cross-product combinations. Most cross-product combinations of initiation and susceptibility yielded positive associations. For example , trying e-cigarettes was associated with concomitant increases in curiosity about cigarettes ( OR: 5.69; 95 % CI: 3.68 , 8.79) and hookah ( OR: 4.19; 95 % CI: 2.55 , 6.88) and with increased willingness to try cigarettes ( OR: 9.61; 95 % CI: 5.67 , 16.3) , hookah ( OR: 8.46; 95 % CI: 4.76 , 15.0) , and smokeless tobacco ( OR: 3.48; 95 % CI: 1.75 , 6.94). New use of one tobacco product may catalyze subsequent use of others through cross-product changes in perceptions and susceptibility.
