  We use a microscopically motivated generalized Langevin equation ( GLE) approach to link the vibrational density of states ( VDOS) to the dielectric response of orientational glasses ( OGs). The dielectric function calculated based on the GLE is compared with experimental data for the paradigmatic case of two OGs: freon-112 and freon-113 , around and just above T _ ( g). The memory function is related to the integral of the VDOS times a spectral coupling function γ ( ω _ ( p)) , which tells the degree of dynamical coupling between molecular degrees of freedom at different eigenfrequencies. The comparative analysis of the two freons reveals that the appearance of a secondary β relaxation in freon-112 is due to cooperative dynamical coupling in the regime of mesoscopic motions caused by stronger anharmonicity ( absent in freon-113) and is associated with the comparatively lower boson peak in the VDOS. The proposed framework brings together all the key aspects of glassy physics ( VDOS with the boson peak , dynamical heterogeneity , dissipation , and anharmonicity) into a single model.
