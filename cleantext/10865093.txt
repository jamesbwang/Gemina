  Frontotemporal dementia ( FTD) is the second most common presenile dementia characterized by behavioral changes and language impairment. The diagnosis of FTD relies heavily on neuroimaging , and sometimes on genetic screening. However , the genetic components in Chinese FTD patients remain largely unknown. Only a few FTD cases with established mutations have been reported in China. This study reported the detailed clinical and neuroimaging features in a Chinese behavioral variant FTD family. The role of By detailed inquiry of all affected individuals in the family , this study summarized the main clinical features of the disease. Four candidate genes ( By direct sequencing of candidate genes ( For the inherited FTD patients , ASL-MRI and genetic identification were strongly recommended for the final diagnosis. In case of being underestimated , the role of
