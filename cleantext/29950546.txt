  Incretins are gastro-intestinal hormones released from enteroendocrine cells in response to food intake. Incretins such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1) modulate glucose homeostasis by regulating glucose-dependent insulin release from pancreatic Î²cells. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4) inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are incretin-based drugs that have been used for the management of hyperglycemia and obesity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although experimental studies have shown that incretin improves bone quality and increases bone mass in rodents , further studies are necessary to clarify the effect of incretin-based drugs on bone mineral density and risk of fractures in humans.
