  Asthmatics sensitized to fungi<pathogen> are reported to have more severe asthma , yet the immunopathogenic pathways contributing to this severity have not been identified. In a pilot assessment of human asthmatics , those subjects sensitized to fungi<pathogen> demonstrated elevated levels of the common γ-chain cytokine IL-7 in lung lavage fluid , which negatively correlated with the lung function measurement PC20. Subsequently , we show that IL-7 administration during experimental fungal asthma worsened lung function and increased the levels of type 2 cytokines ( IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-13) , proallergic chemokines ( CCL17 , CCL22) and proinflammatory cytokines ( IL-1α , IL-1β). Intriguingly , IL-7 administration also increased IL-22 , which we have previously reported to drive immunopathogenic responses in experimental fungal asthma. Employing IL22
