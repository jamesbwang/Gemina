  To accelerate the development of novel vaccines for schistosomiasis , we set out to develop a human model for Schistosoma mansoni infection in healthy volunteers. During natural infections , female schistosomes produce eggs that give rise to morbidity. Therefore , we produced single-sex , male Schistosoma mansoni cercariae for human<disease> infection<disease> without egg production and associated pathology. Cercariae were produced in their intermediate snail hosts in accordance with the principles of good manufacturing practice ( GMP). The application of GMP principles to an unconventional production process is a showcase for the controlled production of complex live challenge material in the European Union or under Food and Drug Administration guidance.
