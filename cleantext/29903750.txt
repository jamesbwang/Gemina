  Epigenetic changes contribute to pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( PanNET) development. Hypermethylation of promoter DNA as a cause of tumor suppressor gene silencing is a well-established oncogenic mechanism that is potentially reversible and therefore an interesting therapeutic target. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 ( MEN1) is the most frequent cause of inherited PanNETs. The aim of this study was to determine promoter methylation profiles in MEN1-related PanNETs. Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was used to assess promoter methylation of 56 tumor suppressor genes in MEN1-related ( n = 61) and sporadic ( n = 34) PanNETs. Differences in cumulative methylation index ( CMI) , individual methylation percentages and frequency of promoter hypermethylation between subgroups were analysed. We found promotor methylation of a large number of potential tumor suppressor genes. CMI ( median CMI 912 versus 876 , p = 0.207) was the same in MEN1-related and sporadic PanNETs. We found higher methylation percentages of CASP8 in MEN1-related PanNETs ( median 59 % versus 16.5 % , p = 0.002). In MEN1-related non-functioning PanNETs , the CMI was higher in larger PanNETs ( > 2 cm) ( median 969.5 vs 838.5; p = 0.021) and in PanNETs with liver metastases ( median 1036 vs 869; p = 0.013). Hypermethylation of MGMT2 was more frequent in non-functioning PanNETs compared to insulinomas ( median 44.7 % versus 8.3 %; p = 0.022). Hypermethylation of the Von Hippel-Lindau gene promoter was observed in one MEN1-related PanNET and was associated with loss of protein expression. Promoter hypermethylation is a frequent event in MEN1-related and sporadic PanNETs. Targeting DNA methylation could be of therapeutic value in MEN1 patients with advanced PanNETs.
