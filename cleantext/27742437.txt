  That breast carcinoma is the most common malignant lesion<symptom> in women. This study aimed to differentiate benign from malignant breast lesions<symptom> and to predict grading of the latter by comparing the diagnostic value of different parameters in intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging ( IVIM-DWI). Retrospective analysis was performed utilizing imaging and pathological data from 112 patients with 124 breast lesions<symptom> that underwent IVIM-DWI examination with 3.0 T MRI. Out of 124 , 47 benign and 77 malignant lesions<symptom> were confirmed by pathological diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of f , D , and D * value to distinguish benign from malignant breast lesions<symptom> , was evaluated using pathological results as the gold standard. Correlation between D value and Ki-67 index was evaluated to predict grading of malignant breast lesions<symptom>. The D value ( 0.99 ± 0.21) of patients with malignant lesions<symptom> was significantly lower than that ( 1.34 ± 0.18) of patients harboring benign lesions<symptom> ( P = .00). The D * value ( 7.60 ± 2.10) in malignant lesion<symptom> group was higher than that ( 6.83 ± 2.13) of the benign lesion<symptom> group ( P = .113). The f value ( 8.50 ± 2.13) in malignant lesion<symptom> group was remarkably higher than that ( 7.68 ± 1.98) of benign lesion<symptom> group ( P = .035). For differential diagnosis of benign from malignant breast lesions<symptom> , optimal diagnostic threshold of D value and f value were 1.21 and 7.86 , respectively. The areas of D and f values under the ROC curve were 0.883 and 0.601 , respectively. The sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy of D value were 83.0 % , 86.7 % , and 85.5 % , respectively. Accordingly , those indexes of f value were 64.9 % , 57.4 % , and 62.1 % , respectively. Furthermore , the Ki-67 staining index of malignant lesions<symptom> was robustly negatively correlated with D value ( r = -0.395 , P < .01). Concrete parameters of IVIM-DWI can help to improve the specificity and accuracy in differential diagnosis of breast benign and malignant lesions<symptom>. D value is most relevant and valuable in predicting the grading of malignant breast
