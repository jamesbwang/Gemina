  For centuries , mushrooms have been widely used as traditional Chinese medicine in Asia. Apart from polysaccharides and some small-molecule components , such as flavones , ployphenols and terpenes , mushrooms produce a large number of pharmaceutically active proteins , which have become popular sources of natural antitumor , antimicrobial , immunoenhancing agents. These bioactive proteins include lectins , laccases , ribosome inactivating proteins ( RIPs) , nucleases , and fungal immunomodulatory proteins ( FIPs). The review is to summarize the characters of structure and bioactivities involved in antitumor , antiviral , antifungal , antibacterial and immunoenhancing activities of proteins from edible mushrooms , to better understand their mechanisms , and to direct research.
