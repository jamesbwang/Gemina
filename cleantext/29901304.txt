  Erectile dysfunction ( ED) has a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patients and their partners. The sequence and regimens of ED therapy have become quite evident since the advent of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors ( PDE-5). However , there have been continued basic research of the efficacy and safety of these agents and studies aimed at new therapeutic goals. In recent years , the attention of researchers has shifted into a wider range of issues related to the personalized PDE-5 therapy , including sexual satisfaction , psychosocial variables ( e.g. , confidence , self-esteem , quality of relationships) and other potentially related factors. In particular , there are more and more new data on male sexual dysfunction. This review focuses on the relationship between erectile dysfunction and concomitant conditions: depressive symptoms , libido and sexual satisfaction disorders , ejaculation and orgasm abnormalities. The authors outline the possibilities and potential benefits of PDE-5 for patients with comorbid sexual dysfunction and depression<symptom> with a special focus on tadalafil.
