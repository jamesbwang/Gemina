  The objective of this study was to evaluate the anterior tooth movement without and with bonded fixed orthodontic retainers under incremental loading conditions. Six extracted mandibular anterior human teeth were embedded in acrylic resin in True Form I Arch type and 3D reconstruction of Digital Volume Tomography ( DVT) images ( 0.4 mm The use of retainer showed a significant effect on tooth mobility ( 0.008 ± 0.004) compared to non-bonded teeth ( control) ( 0.014 ± 0.009) ( p < 0.0001). The amount of displacement on the tooth basis was also significantly different ( p = 0.0381) being the most for tooth no. 42 ( without: 0.024 ± 0.01; with: 0.012 ± 0.002) ( p = 0.0018). No significant difference was observed between repeated measurements ( p = 0.097) and the incremental magnitude of loading ( 5-30 N: 0.07 ± 0.01-0.09 ± 0.02) ( p > 0.05). Mandibular anterior teeth showed less tooth mobility when bonded with stainless steel wire as opposed to non-bonded teeth but the tooth mobility varied depending on the tooth type. Intermittent increase in loading from 5 to 30 N did not increase tooth displacement.
