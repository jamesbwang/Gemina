  The aim of this study was to record the opinions of Italian oncologists about the use of oral vinorelbine administered metronomically in patients with advanced breast cancer. A series of meetings were held throughout Italy , and participants were asked how much they agreed with each of the several statements. The majority of oncologists agreed that the concept of the minimum biologically effective dose should be used for drugs administered metronomically. Over 50 % agreed that metronomic vinorelbine is an option in first-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced breast cancer , including those with a terminal illness and the elderly , as well as in young and fit patients. Just over one-third of experts agreed that a combination of two chemotherapy agents instead of one is not desirable in metastatic breast cancer because of increased toxicity. Most experts agreed that the main aim of a first-line therapy is to control the disease over time and to preserve quality of life. Metronomically administered oral vinorelbine , either as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs , is effective in the long-term treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer. The clinical profiles of patients should be carefully considered to determine the appropriate treatment strategy.
