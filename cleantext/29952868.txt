Test-retest reliability of a commercial linear position transducer ( GymAware PowerTool) to measure velocity and power in the back squat and bench press. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-This study examined the test-retest reliability of the GymAware PowerTool ( GYM) to measure velocity and power in the free-weight back squat and bench press. Twenty-nine academy rugby league players ( age: 17.6 ± 1.0 years; body mass: 87.3 ± 20.8 kg) completed 2 test-retest sessions for the back squat followed by 2 test-retest sessions for the bench press. GYM measured mean velocity ( MV) , peak velocity ( PV) , mean power ( MP) , and peak power at 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 , and 90 % of 1 repetition maximum ( 1RM). GYM showed good reliability ( intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC) and standard error of measurement percentage , respectively) for the measurement of MV at loads of 40 ( 0.77 , 3.9 %) , 60 ( 0.83 , 4.8 %) , 80 ( 0.83 , 5.8 %) , and 90 % ( 0.79 , 7.9 %) of 1RM in the back squat. In the bench press , good reliability was evident for PV at 40 ( 0.82 , 3.9 %) , 60 ( 0.81 , 5.1 %) , and 80 % ( 0.77 , 8.4 %) of 1RM , and for MV at 80 ( 0.78 , 7.9 %) and 90 % ( 0.87 , 9.9 %) of 1RM. The measurement of MP showed good to excellent levels of reliability across all relative loads ( ICC ≥ 0.75). In conclusion , GYM provides practitioners with reliable kinematic information in the back squat and bench press , at least with loads of 40-90 % of 1RM. This suggests that strength and conditioning coaches can use the velocity data to regulate training load according to daily readiness and target specific components of the force-velocity curve. However , caution should be taken when measuring movement velocity at loads < 40 % of 1RM.
