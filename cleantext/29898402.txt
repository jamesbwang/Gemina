  How cells adapt to varying environmental conditions is largely unknown. Here , we show that , in budding yeast , the RNA-binding and stress granule protein Pub1 has an intrinsic property to form condensates upon starvation or heat stress and that condensate formation is associated with cell-cycle arrest. Release from arrest coincides with condensate dissolution , which takes minutes ( starvation) or hours ( heat shock<symptom>). In vitro reconstitution reveals that the different dissolution rates of starvation- and heat-induced condensates are due to their different material properties: starvation-induced Pub1 condensates form by liquid-liquid demixing and subsequently convert into reversible gel-like particles; heat-induced condensates are more solid-like and require chaperones for disaggregation. Our data suggest that different physiological stresses , as well as stress durations and intensities , induce condensates with distinct physical properties and thereby define different modes of stress adaptation and rates of recovery.
