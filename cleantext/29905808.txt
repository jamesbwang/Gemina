  In the ANRS 165 DARULIGHT study ( NCT02384967) carried out in HIV-infected patients , the use of a darunavir/ritonavir-containing regimen with a switch to a reduced dose of darunavir maintained virological efficacy ( ≤ 50 copies/mL) for 48 weeks with a good safety profile. To assess the total and unbound blood plasma pharmacokinetics of darunavir and associated antiretrovirals , and their penetration into semen before and after dose reduction. Patients receiving a darunavir/ritonavir ( 800/100 mg q24h)- containing regimen for > 6 months with plasma HIV-RNA ≤ 50 copies/mL for > 12 months were switched to 400/100 mg darunavir/ritonavir q24h at week 0. A 24 h intensive pharmacokinetic blood sampling and a trough seminal sampling were performed before ( week 0) and after ( week 12) dose reduction. Individual pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were obtained using non-linear mixed-effect modelling for darunavir/ritonavir in blood plasma and used to test for bioequivalence , whereas darunavir/ritonavir in seminal plasma and NRTIs were analysed using a non-compartmental approach. Fifteen patients completed the intensive pharmacokinetic analysis. There was no significant decrease in total and unbound darunavir blood plasma exposure despite a 50 % decrease in darunavir daily dose from 800 to 400 mg ( AUC0-24 = 65563 versus 52518 ng · h/mL; P = 0.25). A decrease in apparent oral clearance ( CL/F) of both darunavir and ritonavir at week 12 suggests a modification of the initial darunavir/ritonavir daily dose balance<symptom> ( 800/100 to 400/100 mg) , in favour of a reduced inducer effect of darunavir on cytochrome P450 and efflux transporters compared with the standard dose.
