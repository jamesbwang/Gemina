  Insulin injection aspects , such as fear of injection and pain , directly affect glycemic control , patient adherence and quality of life. Use of thinner and shorter needles could increase acceptance of injections. The aim of the study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of the new 34G × 3.5 mm needle compared to a 32G × 4 mm in patients with diabetes treated with insulin. This is an open , randomized , two-period crossover , non-inferiority trial. Every treatment period lasted 3 weeks. Patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes , treated with multiple daily insulin injections , were randomly assigned to receive a 34G × 3.5 mm or a 32G × 4 mm pen needle. The primary endpoint was the non-inferiority of the 34G × 3.5 mm in comparison with the 32G × 4 mm pen needle in terms of percentage absolute change of blood fructosamine ( % | ΔFru |) , using a non-inferiority margin of 20 %. Overall 77 patients were randomized and 73 completed the study. Patients characteristics were: 52 % male , 80.5 % affected by type 1 diabetes , mean age 52 years ( ± 14.6) , mean BMI 24.5 kg/m The 34G × 3.5 mm needle was non-inferior to the 32G × 4 mm needle regarding fructosamine levels and glycemic variability supporting the suitability of the 34G × 3.5 mm needle for insulin injection in patients with diabetes.
