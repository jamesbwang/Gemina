  Aim of the present study is to compare magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) and positron emission tomography ( PET) parameters in the follow up of chronic periaortitis ( CP) , with a focus on changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) and standardized uptake values ( SUV). 127 patients with CP were treated in our urology between 2007 and 2017. We identified 14 patients with parallel abdominal MRI and PET-CT examinations before therapy and in the follow up resulting in a total of 56 examinations. Relative contrast uptake and diffusion-weighted MRI parameters were compared to SUV in the corresponding PET-CT examinationsand laboratory infection markers. All examined MRI and PET-CT parameters showed significant changes between basis and follow-up examinations. Median ADC values increased significantly ( p < 0.001) in the follow up. SUVmax and the other MR parameter ( contrast uptake , DWI-signal) declined significantly. We observed a strong negative correlation between ADC and SUVmax ( rho:- 0.61; p < 0.001). In addition , we found an inverse correlation of ADC with the inflammation<symptom> markers ESR ( rho:- 0.64; p < 0.001) and CRP ( rho:- 0.54; p = 0.001). MRI and PET-CT showed comparable results in the individual follow up of CP and compared to laboratory inflammation<symptom> markers. Our data support MRI as first imaging modality due to absent radiation and the necessity of repetitive follow-up examinations in patients with CP.
