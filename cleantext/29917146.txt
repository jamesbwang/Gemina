  Opportunistic invasive fungal infections ( IFIs) comprise a heterogeneous spectrum of pathogens , whose early diagnosis remains challenging. Candida spp. and Aspergillus<pathogen> spp , the most frequent pathogens in immunocompromised patients , frequently affect lungs , liver , bone and skin. To evaluate the impact of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the management of immunocompromised patients with IFI. A single-center retrospective study included 51 immunocompromised patients with IFI diagnosis undergoing 83 18F-FDG PET/CTs. Twenty-nine 18F-FDG PET/CTs were performed for primary work-up in 29 treatment-na√Øve patients. Fifty-four PET/CTs were performed during follow-up to confirm IFI suspicion in 22 patients who had antifungal drug therapy before PET/CT. When available , histological and/or microbiological criteria were used to assess IFI diagnosis. Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. were the most frequent microorganisms responsible for IFI in our population. 18F-FDG PET/CT sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive values , and global accuracy were 93 % , 81 % , 95 % , 72 % , and 90 % , respectively. 18F-FDG PET/CT influenced the diagnostic work-up at primary staging in 16/29 patients ( 55 %) by assessing the extent of infection and targeting the diagnostic procedure. 18F-FDG PET/CT results during treatment induced antifungal drugs dosage increase and/or new drugs addition in 8/54 cases ( 15 %) and contributed to the reduction of antifungal drugs dosage or treatment withdraws in 17 cases ( 31 %). We recommend the utilization of 18F-FDG PET/CT to improve the primary staging work-up of immunocompromised patients with IFI and to assess treatment effectiveness or disease relapse. Both 18F-FDG PET/CT and conventional imaging should be integrated into a well-defined imaging diagnostic algorithm considering the clinical context and both strengths and limitations of each diagnostic modality.
