  Achieving stability with highly active Ru nanoparticles for electrocatalysis is a major challenge for the oxygen evolution reaction. As improved stability of Ru catalysts has been shown for bulk surfaces with low-index facets , there is an opportunity to incorporate these stable facets into Ru nanoparticles. Now , a new solution synthesis is presented in which hexagonal close-packed structured Ru is grown on Au to form nanoparticles with 3D branches. Exposing low-index facets on these 3D branches creates stable reaction kinetics to achieve high activity and the highest stability observed for Ru nanoparticle oxygen evolution reaction catalysts. These design principles provide a synthetic strategy to achieve stable and active electrocatalysts.
