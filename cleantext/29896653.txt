  Over the past three decades , calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP) has emerged as a key molecule. Provocation experiments have demonstrated that intravenous CGRP infusion induces migraine-like attacks in migraine with and without aura patients. In addition , these studies have revealed a heterogeneous CGRP response , i.e. , some migraine patients develop migraine-like attacks after CGRP infusion , while others do not. The role of CGRP in human migraine models has pointed to three potential sites of CGRP-induced migraine: ( 1) vasodilation via cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP) and possibly cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP); ( 2) activation of trigeminal sensory afferents , and ( 3) modulation of deep brain structures. In the future , refined human experimental studies will continue to unveil the role of CGRP in migraine pathogenesis.
