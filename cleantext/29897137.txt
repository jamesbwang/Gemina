  Little attention has been given to the burden of chronic urticaria ( CU) in Japan compared with other skin diseases , such as atopic dermatitis<disease> ( AD) and psoriasis. The primary objective of the RELEASE study was to evaluate the real-life quality-of-life impairment in CU patients in Japan. Data were collected from 1443 urticaria , 1668 AD and 435 psoriatic patients; 552 urticaria patients who presented urticaria symptoms for over 6 weeks were defined as CU. The mean Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI) total score was 4.8 , 6.1 and 4.8 in CU , AD and psoriatic patients , respectively. Disease control of urticaria evaluated by the Urticaria Control Test ( UCT) and DLQI exhibited a strong correlation with a Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient of -0.7158. CU and AD patients had relatively higher scores in all Work Productivity and Activity Impairment- General Health subscales except for absenteeism. At the time of the survey , approximately 64 % of CU patients reported UCT scores of < 12 and demonstrated higher work productivity loss and activity impairment versus patients with UCT scores of â‰¥ 12. Patients with lower UCT scores also displayed a higher percentage of dissatisfaction with their health state and the treatment they received. Approximately 85 % of patients with CU had visited dermatology clinics , and less than 20 % had visited hospital , indicating existence of a highly burdened population outside specialized centers. These results highlight the unmet medical needs of CU patients , suggesting the need to increase awareness of CU burden among both physicians and patients and to pursue improved real-life patient care.
