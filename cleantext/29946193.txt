  Cancer cells subvert host immune surveillance by altering immune checkpoint ( IC) proteins. Some Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV)- associated tumors have higher Programmed Cell Death Ligand , PD-L1 expression. However , it is not known how EBV alters ICs in the context of its preferred host , the B lymphocyte<symptom> and in derived lymphomas. Here , we found that latency III-expressing Burkitt lymphoma ( BL) , diffuse large B-cell lymphomas ( DLBCL) or their EBNA2-transfected derivatives express high PD-L1. In a DLBCL model , EBNA2 but not LMP1 is sufficient to induce PD-L1. Latency III-expressing DLBCL biopsies showed high levels of PD-L1. The PD-L1 targeting oncosuppressor microRNA miR-34a was downregulated in EBNA2-transfected lymphoma cells. We identified early B-cell factor 1 ( EBF1) as a repressor of miR-34a transcription. Short hairpin RNA ( shRNA)- mediated knockdown of EBF1 was sufficient to induce miR-34a transcription , which in turn reduced PD-L1. MiR-34a reconstitution in EBNA2-transfected DLBCL reduced PD-L1 expression and increased its immunogenicity in mixed lymphocyte<symptom> reactions ( MLR) and in three-dimensional biomimetic microfluidic chips. Given the importance of PD-L1 inhibition in immunotherapy and miR-34a dysregulation in cancers , our findings may have important implications for combinatorial immunotherapy , which include IC inhibiting antibodies and miR-34a , for EBV-associated cancers.
