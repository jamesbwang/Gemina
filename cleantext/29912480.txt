  Opioidergic conditioning is well documented to trigger cardioprotection against ischemia/ reperfusion ( I/R) injury. Previous studies on animal models have suggested that nitric oxide ( NO) mediates the beneficial effect of opioids , but the role of NO in humans seems to be controversial. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of NO modulators on opioid-induced cardioprotection in the human myocardium. Trabeculae of the human right atria were electrically driven in an organ bath and subjected to simulated I/R injury. The non-selective inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase ( NOS)- N-methyl-l-arginine ( LNMMA) , the donor of NO- S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine ( SNAP) or morphine ( in the amount of 10-4 M) were used at the time of re-oxygenation. The additional trabecula was subjected to the hypoxia protocol only ( control). The contractility of the myocardium was assessed as the maximal force of a contraction ( Amax) , the rate of rise of the force of a contraction ( Slope L) and the cardiac muscle relaxation- as the rate of decay of the force of a contraction ( Slope T). The application of 100 µM LNMMA resulted in the decrease of Amax , Slope L and Slope T during the re-oxygenation period as compared to control. The application of 10-4 M morphine and/or 100 µM SNAP resulted in a partial reversal of the detrimental influence of LNMMA. At the re-oxygenation period , the blockade of NO synthesis has a deleterious effect on the systolic and diastolic function of the human myocardium as well as attenuates the beneficial effect of morphine conditioning.
