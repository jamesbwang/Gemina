  This study aims to investigate the willingness to pay ( WTP) for a home-based rehabilitation service and explore the influencing factors of WTP among older adults in Shanghai , China. A cross-sectional design was used. A questionnaire survey based on the contingent valuation method was conducted by face-to-face survey over 3 months. Only 242 ( 44 %) participants were willing to pay for a home-based rehabilitation service. The median amount they were willing to pay was RMB 8 ( US$ 1.15) per visit. Older adults who had higher monthly income , had at least one partner who worked , and had medical insurance were willing to pay more for the service. Older adults showed low WTP for a home-based rehabilitation service. Economic status and health condition are the significant influencing factors of WTP. Studies on recipients ' precise needs and ability to pay are required before home-based services are implemented.
