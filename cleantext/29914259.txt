  We proposed the deprotection-induced block copolymer self-assembly ( DISA); that is , the deprotection of hydroxyl groups resulted in in situ self-assembly of glycopolymers. In the previous studies , block copolymers soluble in common organic solvents were employed as the starting material. In this paper , by using the protected glyco-block containing preassembled glycovesicles in water as the starting material , we moved forward and made two exceeding achievements. First , we have observed a deprotection-induced morphology transition triggered by alkali in water. The carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions were considered to contribute to such a morphology transition during deprotection. Second , lipase was found to be an efficient enzymatic trigger in the sugar deprotection , which motivates the immune-application of this morphology transition process. When lipase and a model antigen , ovalbumin ( OVA) , were encapsulated inside the glycovesicles , the deprotection of sugars by lipase induced the transition of vesicles to micelles and the lipase and OVA were released accordingly. When glycovesicles were internalized by dentritic cells ( DCs) , the lipase from lysosomes efficiently induced the release of OVA and presentation of antigen to T cells. During the process , lysosomal lipase performed as a trigger on the deprotection of sugars and the release of protein without any other reagents. The significance of this design is that as a delivery vehicle , the protected glycovesicles not only avoided unnecessary immune activation but also worked with the released OVA together; that is , the glycovehicle successfully activated DCs and improved the presentation efficiency of T cells remarkably.
