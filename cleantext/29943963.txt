  Despite successful repair of acute type A aortic dissection ( TAAD) , the distal false lumen may remain patent resulting in progressive degeneration of the remaining distal aorta. This can lead to aneurysmal dilatation and risk of rupture. Open distal reoperation to replace the residually dissected thoraco-abdominal aorta may be accomplished with acceptable morbidity and mortality in experienced hands. This can be facilitated when the index operation for acute TAAD is tailored to exclude all primary tears and set the arch and descending aorta for a subsequent open , endovascular or hybrid procedure.
