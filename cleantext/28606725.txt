  The association between perioperative blood transfusion and the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer is still unclear. A total of 1581 patients with gastric cancer who underwent curative gastrectomy from 2000 to 2008 were evaluated. Perioperative blood transfusion was defined as the transfusion of packed red blood cells within seven days before surgery , during surgery , or within the postoperative hospitalization period. The association between perioperative blood transfusion and prognosis was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Of 1581 patients , 298 patients ( 19 %) received perioperative blood transfusion. Perioperative blood transfusion correlated with older age ( P < 0.001); larger tumor size ( P < 0.001); and more advanced stage ( P < 0.001). Five-year survival rate was 40 % in patients who had perioperative blood transfusion and 55 % patients who did not have perioperative blood transfusion , and the difference was statistically significant ( P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that perioperative blood transfusion was defined as independent prognostic factor. Perioperative blood transfusion was associated with worse outcomes in patients with stage III ( P < 0.001). Perioperative blood transfusion independently correlated with poorer prognosis in patients with gastric cancer.
