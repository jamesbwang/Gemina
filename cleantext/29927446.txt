  A supramolecular nanovesicle was constructed by complexation between pyrophaeophorbide A ( PPhA) and water-soluble pillar ( 5) arene , and then a biotin-pyridinium targeting agent was introduced to its surface. This nanovesicle exhibited reduced aggregation of PPhA photosensitizers and high targeting ability towards cancer cells , thereby leading to excellent therapeutic efficacy under red light.
