  IL-35 has been identified as a novel anti-inflammatory cytokine that belongs to the IL-12 cytokine family and has been verified to play a protective role in autoimmune diseases. In this study , we investigated the protective effects of IL-35 on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R) injury in a middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model. We determined that the expression of IL-35 was initially decreased and subsequently increased in I/R injury. Moreover , IL-35 ( i.c.v.) pre- and posttreatment significantly reduced the infarct volume and improved neurological deficits after 45 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Importantly , IL-35 treatment improved neurological function recovery , particularly in balance<symptom> ability , at 14 days after treatment. Finally , our results showed that IL-35 treatment reduced the expression of IL-6 and IL-1Î² , which are confirmed proinflammatory cytokines , thus indicating that these cytokines have both been linked to the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of IL-35. Therefore , IL-35 may be a key immune mediator in brain ischemic injury and appears to have promising potential for clinical trials.
