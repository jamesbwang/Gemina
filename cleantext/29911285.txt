  As global environmental change drives inequitable health outcomes , novel health equity assessment methodologies are increasingly required. We review literatures on equity-focused HIA to clarify how equity is informing HIA practice , and to surface innovations for assessing health equity in relation to a range of exposures across geographic and temporal scales. A narrative review of the health equity and HIA literatures analysed English articles published between 2003 and 2017 across PubMed , PubMed Central , Biomed Central and Ovid Medline. Title and abstract reviews of 849 search results yielded 89 articles receiving full text review. Considerations of equity in HIA increased over the last 5 years , but equity continues to be conflated with health disparities rather than their root causes ( i.e. inequities). Lessons from six literatures to inform future HIA practice are described: HIA for healthy cities , climate change vulnerability assessment , cumulative health risk assessment , intersectionality-based policy analysis , corporate health impact assessment and global health impact assessment. Academic reporting on incorporating equity in HIA practice has been limited. Nonetheless , significant methodological advancements are being made to examine the health equity implications of multiple environmental exposures.
