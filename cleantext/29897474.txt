  Peripubertal obesity is associated with variable hyperandrogenemia , but precise mechanisms remain unclear. To assess insulin resistance , hyperinsulinemia , and LH roles in peripubertal obesity-associated hyperandrogenemia. Cross-sectional analysis. Academic clinical research unit. Eleven obese ( body mass index for age â‰¥ 95 %) peripubertal girls. Blood samples were taken during a mixed-meal tolerance test ( 1900 to 2100) , overnight ( 2100 to 0700) , while fasting ( 0700 to 0900) , and during an 80 mU/m2/min hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp ( 0900 to 1100). The dependent variable was morning free testosterone level; independent variables were insulin sensitivity index ( ISI) , estimated 24-hour insulin , and estimated 24-hour LH levels. All participants demonstrated insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. ISI , but not estimated 24-hour insulin level , correlated positively with morning free testosterone level when correcting for estimated 24-hour LH level and Tanner stage ( rs = 0.68 , P = 0.046). The correlation between estimated 24-hour LH and free testosterone levels approached significance after adjusting for estimated 24-hour insulin level and Tanner stage ( rs = 0.63 , P = 0.067). Estimated 24-hour insulin level did not correlate with free testosterone level after adjusting for estimated 24-hour LH level and Tanner stage ( rs = 0.47 , P = 0.20). In insulin-resistant obese girls with hyperinsulinemia , free testosterone levels correlated positively with insulin sensitivity and , likely , circulating LH concentrations but not with circulating insulin levels. In the setting of relatively uniform hyperinsulinemia , variable steroidogenic-cell insulin sensitivity may correlate with metabolic insulin sensitivity and contribute to variable free testosterone concentrations.
