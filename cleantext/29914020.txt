  Microglia , the primary immune cells in the brain , sense pathogens and tissue damage , stimulate cytokine production , and phagocytosis to maintain homeostasis. Accumulation of amyloid-β peptides ( Aβ) in the brain triggers the onset of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). Accordingly , promotion of Aβ clearance represents a promising strategy for AD therapy. We previously demonstrated that primary-cultured rat microglia phagocytose Aβ , and that transplantation of these cells ameliorates the Aβ burden in brains of Aβ-injected rats. In this study , we demonstrate that stimulation with colony-stimulating factor-1 efficiently differentiates mouse bone<disease> marrow cells into bone marrow-derived microglia-like ( BMDML) cells that express markers for microglia , including the recently identified transmembrane protein 119. BMDML cells effectively phagocytose Aβ in vitro , with effects comparable to primary-cultured mouse microglia and greater than peritoneal macrophages. RT-qPCR analysis for cytokine mRNA levels revealed that BMDML cells polarize to a relatively anti-inflammatory state under non-stimulated and inflammatory conditions but exert a pro-inflammatory reaction after lipopolysaccharide treatment. Moreover , BMDML cells hippocampally injected into a mouse model of AD are morphologically similar to the ramified and amoeboid types of residential microglia. Comparisons with simulations assuming a uniform distribution of cells suggest that BMDML cells migrate directionally toward Aβ plaques. We also detected Aβ phagocytosis by BMDML cells , concomitant with a reduction in the number and area of Aβ plaques. Finally , we observed amelioration of cognitive impairment in a mouse model of AD after hippocampal injection of BMDML cells. Our results suggest that BMDML cells have potential as a cell-based disease-modifying therapy against AD.
