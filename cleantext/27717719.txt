  Dehydration<symptom> on admission is correlated with neurological deterioration ( ND). The primary objective of our study was to use support vector machine ( SVM) algorithms to identify an ND prognostic model , based on dehydration<symptom> equations. This study included a total of 382 patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke. The following parameters were recorded: age , sex , laboratory values ( serum sodium , potassium , chlorinum , glucose , and urea) , and vascular risk factor data. Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the discriminative performance of the BUN/Cr ratio as well as each of 38 equations for predicting ND. We used the Boruta algorithm for feature selection. After optimizing the SVM kernel parameters , we built an SVM model to predict ND and used the test set to obtain predictive values for assessing model accuracy. In total , 102 of 382 patients ( 26.7 %) with acute ischemic stroke developed ND. In all patients , the BUN/Cr ratio and each of 38 equations were significant predictors of ND. Equation 20 ( 1.86 Ã— Na + + glucose + urea + 9) yielded the maximum area under the ROC curve , and faired best in terms of prognostic performance ( a cutoff value of 284.49 mM yielded a sensitivity of 94.12 % and specificity of 61.43 %). Equation 32 predicted ND poststroke across population groups , and worked well in older as well as young adults; ( a cutoff value of 297.08 mM yielded a sensitivity of 93.14 % and specificity of 60.00 %). Feature selection by the Boruta algorithm was used to decrease the number of variables from 18 to 5 in the condition. The specificity of test samples for the SVM prediction model increased from 44.1 % to 89.4 % , and the AUC increased from 0.700 to 0.927. SVM algorithms can be used to establish a prediction model for dehydration-associated ND , with good classification results.
