  The interface between calmodulin ( CaM) and the NO synthase ( NOS) heme domain is the least characterized interprotein interface that the NOS isoforms must traverse through during catalysis. Our previous molecular dynamics simulations predicted a salt bridge between K497 in human inducible NOS ( iNOS) heme domain and D118 ( CaM). Herein , the FMN- heme interdomain electron transfer ( IET) rate was found to be notably decreased by charge-reversal mutation , while the IET in the iNOS K497D mutant is significantly restored by the CaM D118K mutation. The results of wild-type protein with added synthetic peptides further demonstrate the critical nature of K497 relative to the rest of the peptide sequence in modulating the IET. These data provide definitive evidence supporting the regulatory role of the isoform-specific K497 residue.
