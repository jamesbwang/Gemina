  Methyl ferulic acid ( MFA) is a biologically active monomer extracted and purified from the Chinese herbal medicine Securidaca inappendiculata hasskarl. The previously studies showed that MFA improved acute liver injury induced by ethanol. However , the effect of MFA on ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis in alcoholic liver disease ( ALD) still remains unclear. The current study was aimed at elucidating the effect of MFA on alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis and the underlying mechanisms. Human hepatocyte L-02 cells exposed to 200 mM ethanol for 24 h to simulate alcoholic steatosis in vitro. SD rats were fed a Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 5 % ( w/v) alcohol for 16 weeks to induce alcoholic liver disease in vivo. We examined the effect of MFA on ethanol-induced lipid deposition in L-02 cells and SD rats. The results showed that MFA reduced the accumulation of lipid in L-02 cells , improved alcoholic liver injury in rats , alleviated hepatic pathological lesions<symptom> , and reduced lipid deposition in rat serum and liver. Further studies suggest that MFA reduces lipid synthesis by activating AMPK-ACC/MAPK-FoxO 1 pathway. In addition , MFA also promotes lipid oxidation by up-regulating the expression of SIRT1 , PPAR-α , and CPT-1α. Taken together , MFA ameliorates ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis by activating AMPK-ACC/MAPK-FoxO 1 pathway and up-regulating the expression levels of SIRT1 , PPAR-α , and CPT-1α.
