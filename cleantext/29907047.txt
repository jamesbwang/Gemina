  We present a perturbative correction within initiator full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo ( i-FCIQMC). In the existing i-FCIQMC algorithm , a significant number of spawned walkers are discarded due to the initiator criteria. Here we show that these discarded walkers have a form that allows the calculation of a second-order Epstein-Nesbet correction , which may be accumulated in a trivial and inexpensive manner , yet substantially improves i-FCIQMC results. The correction is applied to the Hubbard model and the uniform electron gas and molecular systems.
