  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) associates with several extra-pulmonary effects. Muscle<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> and wasting is one of the most prominent extra-pulmonary effects and contributes to exercise limitation and health related quality of life ( HRQoL) , morbidity as well as mortality. The loss of muscle mass is characterised by an impaired balance<symptom> between protein synthesis ( anabolism) and protein breakdown ( catabolism) which relates to nutritional disturbances , muscle disuse and the presence of a systemic inflammation<symptom> , among other factors. Current approaches to reverse skeletal muscle<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> and wasting attain only modest improvements. The development of new therapeutic strategies aiming at improving skeletal muscle<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> and wasting are needed. This requires a better understanding of the underlying molecular pathways responsible for these abnormalities. In this review we update recent research on protein metabolism , nutritional depletion as well as physical ( in) activity in relation to muscle wasting and dysfunction in patients with COPD. We also discuss the role of nutritional supplementation and exercise training as strategies to re-establish the disrupted balance<symptom> of protein metabolism in the muscle of patients with COPD. Future areas of research and clinical practice directions are also addressed.
