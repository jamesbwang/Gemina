  A practical continuous adsorption study in a packed-bed column was conducted by using two separate layers of kaolin and pine cone based biochar packed bed adsorbents for the removal of methylene blue ( MB) dye from its aqueous solution. A series of column experiments were performed to determine the breakthrough curves ( BTCs) by varying bed height ( 3-7 cm) , inlet flow rate ( 13-17 ml/min) and initial dye concentration ( 50-150 mg/L). The Thomas , Yoon-Nelson , Bed Depth Service Time ( BDST) and Dose response ( DR) dynamic models were applied to column experimental data under various operational conditions to predict the column breakthrough curves ( BTC) using both nonlinear regression and linear regression and to determine various characteristic parameters such as percentage removal of dye , breakthrough time , used bed length , mass transfer zone ( MTZ) and dye adsorption density q
