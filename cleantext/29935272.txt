  MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) have remarkable potential as diagnostic and prognostic markers because of their roles in disease pathogenesis. miRNAs can be released into the bloodstream , where they are sufficiently stable to be detected noninvasively. Here , we prospectively evaluated serum levels of miR-21 , miR-34a , miR-122 , miR-181b , and miR-885-5p in patients with stable cirrhosis. Total RNA was extracted from the sera of patients with cirrhosis and healthy individuals , and the expression levels of the target miRNAs were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Serum miRNAs levels were correlated with liver function parameters , etiology , and complications of cirrhosis. Circulating miR-34a , miR-122 , and miR-885-5p levels were higher in patients with cirrhosis than in healthy individuals. These miRNAs were positively correlated with alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels , and the relative expression levels were higher in hepatitis<disease> C<disease> virus-infected patients and lower in patients with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis. miR-122 and miR-885-5p levels were also positively correlated with Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase concentrations. miR-21 was associated with transplant-free survival in univariate Cox regression analysis and remained independently associated with survival after adjustment for age , Child-Pugh classification , Model for End-stage Liver Disease score , and history of previous decompensation in multivariate Cox regression analysis. These data suggested that miR-34a , miR-122 , and miR-885-5p levels may be more related to the inflammatory process and ongoing hepatocyte damage in patients with cirrhosis. Moreover , miR-21 levels were independently associated with shorter transplant-free survival and may be used as a prognostic tool in outpatients with stable cirrhosis.
