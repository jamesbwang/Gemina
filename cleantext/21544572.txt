  Temperate forest<disease> ecosystems have experienced mounting negative effects due to increasing levels of nitrogen ( N) deposition. We examined the effects of experimental N addition on plant diversity in an old-growth temperate forest<disease> to test the following hypothesis: Long-term excessive N addition decreases plant diversity by affecting the growth of plants , which results from changes in the soil nutrient content and a decrease in the soil pH in temperate forests. Experimental N additions were administered at the following levels since 2008: control ( 0 kg N ha
