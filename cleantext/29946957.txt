  Exercise reduces sympathetic activity ( SA) , arterial pressure and heart rate in spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR). Exercise increases oxidative stress ( OS) and inflammation<symptom> is implicated in the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and progression of hypertension. To unravel these effects of exercise and considering that SA is driven by medullary areas , we hypothesized that swimming exercise ( SW) affects the gene expression ( g.e.) of proteins involved in inflammation<symptom> and OS in the commissural Nucleus of the Solitary Tract ( cNTS) and Rostral ventrolateral medulla ( RVLM) , which control the sympathetic outflow in SHR. We used male SHR and Wistar rats ( 14-16wks-old) which were maintained sedentary ( SED) or submitted to SW ( 1 h/day , 5 days/wk./ 6wks). The g.e. of cycloxygenase-2 ( COX-2) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6) , interleukin 10 ( IL-10) , AT-1 receptor ( AT-1r) , neuroglobin ( Ngb) and cytoglobin ( Ctb) in cNTS and RVLM was carried out by qPCR. We observed that COX-2 g.e. increased in SW-SHR in cNTS and RVLM compared to SED-SHR. The IL-6 g.e. reduced in RVLM in SW-SHR , whereas IL-10 g.e. increased in SW-SHR in comparison to SED-SHR. The AT-1r g.e. decreased in SW-SHR in cNTS and RVLM compared to SED-SHR. The Ngb and Ctb g.e. in cNTS neurons increased in SHR and Wistar rats submitted to SW compared to SED , but only Ctb g.e. increased in RVLM in SW-SHR and Wistar in comparison to SED. Therefore , the SW altered the g.e. in cNTS and RVLM for reducing the inflammation<symptom> and ROS formation , which is increased particularly in SHR , consequently decreasing the OS.
