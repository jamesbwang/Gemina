  Hypertension is a major preventable risk factor for atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease. Although modern and effective antihypertensive drugs are available , most patients remain with a suboptimal blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control. Most hypertensive patients will need a combination of antihypertensive agents to achieve the therapeutic goals- recent guidelines recommend initiating treatment with two drugs in those patients with a systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> > 20 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> > 10 mmHg above the goals , and in those patients with high cardiovascular risk. In addition , approximately 25 % of patients will require three antihypertensive agents to achieve the therapeutic targets. In this review , we analyse the latest information available regarding the treatment of hypertension with combination therapy.
