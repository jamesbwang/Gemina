  Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-associated cases of mortality worldwide. Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 ( COX-2) is considered a therapeutic target for prevention of pancreatic cancer. Nimesulide , a selective COX-2 inhibitor , can induce cell apoptosis , resulting in an anti-cancer effect. However , the mechanism underlying this effect remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of nimesulide on proliferation of PANC-1 cells using an MTT assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by DNA laddering and Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide-stained flow cytometry. Furthermore , western blot analysis was used to elucidate the mechanism underlying nimesulide treatment in PANC-1 cells. It was determined that proliferation of PANC-1 cells was inhibited by nimesulide in a dose-dependent manner. Nimesulide promoted apoptosis of PANC-1 cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that nimesulide increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 and apoptosis regulator Bax ( Bcl-2 associated protein X) , and decreased the expression of pro-caspase-3 and apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 ( B-cell lymphoma 2). Furthermore , nimesulide enhanced expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN) , and decreased the expression level of COX-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor. In summary , the results of the present study demonstrated that nimesulide could induce apoptosis and inhibit growth of PANC-1 cells by enhancing the expression of PTEN , which indicates the potential of nimesulide to prevent tumor angiogenesis.
