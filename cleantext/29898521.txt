  Groundwater pollution by emerging contaminants , such as pharmaceutical and personal care products ( PPCPs) , has caused increasing concerns around the world. The vadose zone is an active zone where lithosphere , hydrosphere and biosphere interact. It is an important medium for PPCPs removal and entry into groundwater from irrigation using wastewater or polluted surface water. In the present study , the occurrence and distribution of eleven PPCPs in areas with a vadose zone ( up to 16 m) was investigated from wastewater irrigated farmland , groundwater irrigated farmland and a seasonal river course in Beijing ( China). Nine out of eleven PPCPs were detectable , and carbamazepine and caffeine had the highest detection frequencies , above 50 %. The PPCPs were detectable deep in 16 m below ground level ( bgl) , and their concentrations ranged from < LOD ( limit of detection) to 12.5 Î¼g/kg. Compared to the vadose zone soils irrigated with groundwater , wastewater-irrigated vadose zone soils had significantly higher PPCPs detection frequencies and contamination levels , suggesting the important roles of irrigation water sources on PPCPs accumulation and transport in the vadose zone. Additionally , PPCPs vertical distribution presented a bell-shape pattern in the vadose zone soils with wastewater irrigation , peaking at 3-6 m bgl. Redundancy analysis ( RDA) indicated a significant correlation between PPCPs concentrations in the vadose zone soils and geochemical variables , including available potassium and silt content. This study provides important evidence on the influential factors of PPCPs accumulation and migration in the vadose zone soils resulted from wastewater irrigation. The incomplete removal of PPCPs poses certain risks in subsurface environment , potentially challenging groundwater quality and drinking water safety.
