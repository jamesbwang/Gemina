  Invasive physiological assessment of myocardial bridges ( MBs) is largely unsettled. Unlike fractional flow reserve ( FFR) , instantaneous wave-free ratio ( iFR) is a diastole-specific index. As such , its value might not be hampered by systolic pressure overshooting and negative systolic pressure gradient caused by the compression of the tunneled coronary artery. We prospectively enrolled 20 patients with angina and/or positive noninvasive stress test , absence of significant coronary artery stenosis , and angiographic suspicion/evidence of MB in the left anterior descending artery. According to a prespecified protocol , all patients underwent functional intracoronary evaluation with FFR at rest and after dobutamine ( up to 20 Î¼g kg Physiological evaluation of MBs with iFR seems to be more consistent with patients ' symptoms and noninvasive test results compared with FFR.
