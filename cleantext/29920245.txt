  Reactive oxygen species ( ROS) scavengers such as beta-mercaptoethanol ( BME) and monothiol glycerol ( MTG) are extensively used in stem cell research to prevent cellular oxidative stress. However , how these antioxidant supplements impact stem cell cardiac differentiation , a process regulated by redox-signaling remains unknown. In this study , we found that removal of BME from the conventional high-glucose , serum-based differentiation medium improved cardiac differentiation efficiency by 2-3 fold. BME and MTG treatments during differentiation significantly reduced mRNA expression of cardiac progenitor markers ( NKX2 .5 and ISL1) as well as sarcomeric markers ( MLC2A , MLC2V , TNNI3 , MYH6 and MYH7) , suggesting reduced cardiomyogenesis by BME or MTG. Moreover , BME and MTG altered the expression ratios between the sarcomeric isoforms. In particular , TNNI3 to TNNI1 ratio and MLC2V to MLC2A ratio were significantly lower in BME or MTG treated cells than untreated cells , implying altered cardiomyocyte phenotype and maturity. Lastly , BME and MTG treatments resulted in less frequent beating , slower contraction and relaxation velocities than untreated cells. Interestingly , none of the above-mentioned effects was observed with Trolox , a non-thiol based antioxidant , despite its strong antioxidant activity. This work demonstrates that commonly used antioxidant supplements may cause considerable changes to cellular redox state and the outcome of differentiation.
