  Patient blood management in orthopaedic surgery reduces transfusion risk. The best protocol is unknown. The effectiveness of a protocol based on the Seville Consensus on the reduction of transfusion risk is evaluated and a predictive transfusion equation is proposed in knee surgery. Cohort study in patients undergoing knee and hip arthroplasty from January 2014 to December 2015 at a second level complexity hospital in Vilafranca del Pened√®s ( Barcelona). Patients with Hb between 10 and 13g/dL were classified as anaemic with or without iron deficiency and received iron or combination of iron and erythropoietin. On the day of surgery , tranexamic acid was administered , the Hb drop was measured the next day and the requirements and the transfusion lintel were measured during the stay. A total of 334 patients were included in the study. The implementation of the programme decreased the transfusion risk from 41.5 % to 14.8 % at the end of the study. In hip surgery , transfused patients were significantly older , sicker and with lower preoperative Hb. Tranexamic acid did not decrease bleeding. In knee surgery , the administration of tranexamic acid was the variable that most decreased the transfusion risk followed by a high preoperative Hb. The equation predicts transfusion risk with a sensitivity of 55 % and specificity of 95.7 %. The implementation of the programme reduces transfusion risk. The effectiveness of tranexamic acid varies according to surgery site. The use of iron and recombinant human erythropoietin is necessary to improve Hb.
