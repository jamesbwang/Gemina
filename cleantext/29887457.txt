  Data on the impact of optimal glycemic control ( OGC) on the progression of coronary artery calcification , an important marker for future adverse cardiovascular events in individuals with diabetes are limited. We investigated 1637 asymptomatic adults with diabetes ( 56 ± 8 years , 88.8 % men) and no history of coronary artery disease or stroke , who underwent serial coronary artery calcium ( CAC) screening. The median inter-scan period was 3.0 ( 2.0-4.4) years. The change in CAC was compared base on OGC status. OGC was defined as a follow-up hemoglobin A1C ( HbA1C) of < 7.0 % , and CAC progression was defined by a square root ( √) transformed difference between the baseline and follow-up CAC scores ( Δ √ transformed CAC) of ≥ 2.5. Despite no significant difference in the baseline CAC scores , the incidence of CAC progression was lower in the OGC group than in the non-OGC group ( 45.4 % vs. 51.7 %; p < 0.013). The two groups differed in the Δ √ transformed ( OGC , 3.8 ± 6.4; non-OGC , 4.7 ± 6.9; p = 0.016) and annualized Δ √ transformed CAC ( OGC , 1.1 ± 2.4; non-OGC , 1.4 ± 2.6; p = 0.010) scores. Subgroup analysis showed that OGC significantly reduced the risk of CAC progression in patients aged < 65 years and in: smokers , and patients with a body mass index of < 25 kg/m OGC attenuated the progression of coronary artery calcification in asymptomatic patients with diabetes.
