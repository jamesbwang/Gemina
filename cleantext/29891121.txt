  We evaluated factors associated with mortality in patients with moderate/severe generalized tetanus<disease> This retrospective study included patients with moderate/severe generalized tetanus<disease> admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University ( China) between January 2005 and January 2017. Clinical data were extracted from medical records. Patients were divided into two groups based on outcome ( survival or death). Factors associated with mortality were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Seventy-five patients were included ( 57.3 % male; age , 57.9 ± 18.4 years; APACHE II score , 10.6 ± 3.4; severe tetanus<disease> , 49.3 %; mortality , 25.3 %). Multivariate analysis identified severe tetanus<disease> ( odds ratio ( OR) , 30.364; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 2.459-374.896) and APACHE II score ( OR , 1.536; 95 % CI , 1.051-2.243) as positively associated with mortality , whereas high-calorie nutrition ( OR , 0.027; 95 % CI , 0.002-0.359) and dexmedetomidine use ( OR , 0.035; 95 % CI , 0.003-0.467) were negatively associated with mortality ( all P < 0.05). Tetanus<disease> severity and APACHE II score were associated with mortality in patients with generalized tetanus<disease> , whereas high-calorie nutrition and dexmedetomidine use reduced the odds of death. High-calorie nutrition and dexmedetomidine administration may improve prognosis in adult patients with moderate/severe generalized
