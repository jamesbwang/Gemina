  In this work , the stepwise synthesis of interpenetrating polymer network ( IPN) strategy was developed in an attempt to fabricate novel hydrogels consisting of sugarcane bagasse cellulose ( SBC) , carboxymethylcellulose ( CMC) and poly ( N-isopropylacrylamide) ( PNIPAm) as a dual-responsive drug carrier. The pretreated and dissolved SBC was pre-crosslinked using epichlorohydrin in the presence of CMC , followed by in-situ free-radical polymerization of NIPAm in the presence of N , N '- Methylene-bis ( acrylamide) as a crosslinking agent. The carboxyl groups in CMC and PNIPAm chains rendered the resulting hydrogel pH and thermal responsive. The results from scanning electron microscopy , infrared spectroscopy , thermogravimetric analysis and mechanical property testing demonstrated the successful formation of the IPN with proper structure and mechanical strength. The swelling experiments at different temperatures and pH showed the dual-sensibility of the hydrogels. Moreover , bovine serum albumin ( BSA) was used as a model drug and loaded in the hydrogel; and the drug release behavior was revealed in phosphate buffer solution ( PBS) and simulated gastric fluid ( SGF). The results indicated that the dual-responsive IPN hydrogel is of great potential for the controlled release of drug.
