  Cough<symptom> is a troublesome and difficult-to-treat symptom that accompanies a diverse range of pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions. Although considerable advances have been made over recent years in basic cough<symptom> biology , this has not translated into improved clinical management. A major challenge has been in understanding the heterogeneity underlying the development and persistence of chronic<symptom> cough<symptom> in different patients. We present evidence that such heterogeneity begins with the multiple peripheral and central neural pathways capable of eliciting cough<symptom> and associated respiratory behaviours , and extends to incorporate the diversity of diseases that underlie cough<symptom> and the clinical phenotypic and pathological endotypic presentations that can vary substantially between individual patients with cough<symptom> A better understanding of how these sources of heterogeneity are expressed across individual patients with chronic<symptom> cough<symptom> is needed to better predict the efficacy of clinical management strategies and of specifically targeted therapies , which will facilitate the development of more personalised clinical approaches to treat patients with
