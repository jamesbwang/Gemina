  In order to solve undercooling and phase separation of sodium acetate trihydrate ( SAT) , experimental screening method was used to select nucleating agents and thickeners that are suitable for SAT , and the optimal ratio was identified. Through screening experiments of nucleating agents , it is found that disodium hydrogen phosphate can be used as an effective nucleating agent for SAT. When the weight content of disodium hydrogen phosphate in SAT is 2 % , the degree of undercooling was reduced to approximately 2 K. The addition of 1 ‚Åª 1.5 % ( weight) of xanthan gum ( XG) to SAT can effectively inhibit the phase separation. Since the properties of SAT changes after the modification , the corresponding comparison analysis was performed. The results showed that XG has a significant influence on the SAT performance of SAT. With the addition of 1.5 wt % of XG in pure SAT , the latent heat of fusion and solid/liquid volume expansion reduce by 5.2 % and 5.4 % respectively , and the thermal conductivity and solid/liquid density also decreases accordingly.
