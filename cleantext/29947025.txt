  Lichen planus pigmentosus ( LPP) is a rare disease characterized by persistent and asymptomatic slate-grey pigmentation , which mostly affects patients with skin types IV-VI. The face and neck are the most commonly involved sites , followed by the trunk and extremities. LPP is believed to spare the palms , soles and nails. In this report , we describe palmoplantar involvement in 10 ( 4.65 % , 10/215) patients with LPP , and compare its clinicodemographic features with those of classic LPP. LPP lesions<symptom> on the palms and soles present as asymptomatic , well-circumscribed , hyperpigmented , brown-black patches without any history of prior lichen planus lesions<symptom>. They are mostly observed in young patients with rapidly spreading active disease , who often require systemic treatment to control the disease activity. Strikingly , palmoplantar involvement is frequently associated with other atypical LPP variants. It is important to identify palmoplantar involvement in LPP , as it has a different clinical course and associations compared with classic LPP.
