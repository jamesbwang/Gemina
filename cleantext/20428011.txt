  This study aimed to demonstrate the immunohistochemical changes associated with MMP-2 and type 1 collagen separately for the first time in the major salivary glands ( the parotid<symptom> , submaxillary , and sublingual glands) that occur with aging in mice. Fourteen Balb/c white mice ( 50-80 g) were used in this study. The animals were divided into two equal groups. Group I consisted of young animals ( 2-month-old) ( n = 7) and Group II consisted of older animals ( 18-month-old) ( n = 7). After routine histological follow-ups , Hematoxylin-eosin ( H&E) , Masson 's Trichrome staining and immunohistochemical staining was performed for type I collagen and MMP-2. We observed that there were age-related decreases in the number of acinar cells , increase in eosinophilic zymogen granules in cells , collagen accumulation in fibrotic areas and dilatation in interlobular ducts. Also , while type I collagen and MMP-2 immunoreactivity were moderate in the salivary glands of the young mice , they were high in the salivary glands of the old mice ( p = 0.001). In the H-score assessment , MMP-2 immunoreactivity was lower at a significant level in young mice than in old mice ( p = 0.001). This study showed that anatomical , physiological and morphological abnormalities occur in all three major salivary glands as a natural consequence of aging.
