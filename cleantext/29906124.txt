  Pd-catalyzed α-arylation of methyl-OBO-ketone ( OBO = 4-methyl-2,6,7-trioxabicyclo ( 2.2.2) octan-1-yl) gives rise to arylated OBO-protected pyruvates. By appropriate prefunctionalization of the aryl ring or by subsequent functionalization at the α-carbonyl position of the arylated OBO-ketones , useful diketo OBO-protected carboxylates can be generated. Cyclization , aromatization , and OBO deprotection of these intermediates , using two distinct routes , gives access to valuable α-acyl heteroaromatic compounds.
