  SEC23B is a component of coat protein complex II ( COPII) vesicles that transport secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) to the Golgi apparatus. Loss-of-function SEC23B mutations cause a rare form of anemia<symptom> , resulting from decreased SEC23B levels. We recently identified germline heterozygous SEC23B variants as potentially cancer-predisposing. Mutant SEC23B associated with ER stress-mediated tumorigenesis , without decreased SEC23B expression. However , our understanding of the processes behind these observations remain limited. Here , we show mutant SEC23B exists within nucleoli , in addition to classical distribution at the ER/Golgi. This occurs independent of other COPII proteins and does not compromise secretory function. Mutant cells have increased ribosomal protein and translation-related gene expression , and enhanced translational capacity , in the presence of ER stress. We show that mutant SEC23B binds to UBF transcription factor , with increased UBF transcription factor binding at the ribosomal DNA promoter. Our data indicate SEC23B has potential non-canonical COPII-independent function , particularly within the ribosome biogenesis pathway , and that may contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer-predisposition.
