  There remains an urgent need for the non-invasive tracking of transfused chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) T cells to determine their biodistribution , viability , expansion , and anti-tumor functionality. 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid ( DOTA) antibody reporter 1 ( DAbR1) comprises a single-chain fragment of the anti-lanthanoid-DOTA antibody 2D12 .5/ G54C fused to the human CD4-transmembrane domain and binds irreversibly to lanthanoid- ( S) -2- ( 4-acrylamidobenzyl)- DOTA ( AABD). The aim of this study was to investigate whether DAbR1 can be expressed on lymphocytes and used as a reporter gene as well as a suicide gene for therapy of immune-related adverse effects.
