  The authors combined virtual reality technology and social robotics to develop a tutoring system that resembled a small-group arrangement. This tutoring system featured a virtual teacher instructing sight words , and included a humanoid robot emulating a peer. The authors used a multiple-probe design across word sets to evaluate the effects of the instructional package on the explicit acquisition and vicarious learning of sight words instructed to three children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) and the robot peer. Results indicated that participants acquired , maintained , and generalized 100 % of the words explicitly instructed to them , made fewer errors while learning the words common between them and the robot peer , and vicariously learned 94 % of the words solely instructed to the robot.
