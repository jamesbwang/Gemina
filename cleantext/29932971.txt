  The gain of foldable wings is regarded as one of the key innovations enabling the present-day diversity of neopteran insects. Wing folding allows compact housing of the wings and shields the insect body from damage. Wing-fixing systems have evolved in some insects , probably to increase the durability of the shielding function by the wings. Bark lice ( Psocodea) are known to possess a unique wing-to-wing repose coupling system , but a detailed morphological and evolutionary study of this system is lacking. In this study , we examined this repose coupling structure by SEM in 32 species including representatives of all three suborders of bark lice ( Trogiomorpha , Troctomorpha and Psocomorpha). We concluded that the repose wing-coupling apparatus independently evolved twice within Psocodea. In Trogiomorpha , the apparatus is located on the subcostal vein of the forewing and is composed of elongated rib-like structures. In Troctomorpha and Psocomorpha , in contrast , the repose coupling structure is located on the radius vein of the forewing and is formed by a swollen vein. These morphological and developmental differences in the repose coupling structures also provide phylogenetic information at different systematic levels.
