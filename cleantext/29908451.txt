  Protein-protein interactions ( PPI) were once considered ` undruggable ' , but clinical successes , driven by advanced methods in drug discovery , have challenged that notion. Here , we review the last three years of literature on PPI inhibitors to understand what is working and why. From the 66 recently reported PPI inhibitors , we found that the average molecular weight was significantly greater than 500Da , but that this trend was driven , in large part , by the contribution of peptide-based compounds. Despite differences in average molecular weight , we found that compounds based on small molecules or peptides were almost equally likely to be potent inhibitors ( K
