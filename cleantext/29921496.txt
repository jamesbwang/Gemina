  Tumor tissues consist of heterogeneous cancer cells and stroma cells , including cancer stem cells and immune cells. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) programs closely associate with acquisition of stemness. We investigated for the first time the clinical significance of combining cancer stem cells , immune cells , and EMT traits. In 419 colorectal carcinomas , stem-cell markers ( Nanog , Lgr5 , CD44v6 , ALDH1A1) , EMT markers ( E-cadherin , Snail) , and immune-cell markers ( CD3 There were correlations among the expression of Nanog , Lgr5 , CD44v6 , and immune cell counts ( P < .05). Nanog , Lgr5 , CD44v6 , and ALDH1A1 positively related to E-cadherin or Snail ( P < .05). A cluster ( termed cluster SIE) based on cancer stemness markers ( Nanog , Lgr5 , CD44v6 , ALDH1A1 in TC) , EMT markers ( E-cadherin , Snail in TC) , and immune-cell markers ( CD4 Cancer stemness , immune state , and EMT programs should be considered as a whole. Cluster SIE was an independent predictor for 5-year survival of patients with colorectal cancer.
