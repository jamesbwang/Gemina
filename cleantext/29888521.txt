  Developing low-cost and high-quality quantum dots ( QDs) or nanocrystals ( NCs) and their corresponding efficient light-emitting diodes ( LEDs) is crucial for the next-generation ultra-high-definition flexible displays. Here , there is a report on a room-temperature triple-ligand surface engineering strategy to play the synergistic role of short ligands of tetraoctylammonium bromide ( TOAB) , didodecyldimethylammonium bromide ( DDAB) , and octanoic acid ( OTAc) toward `` ideal '' perovskite QDs with a high photoluminescence quantum yield ( PLQY) of > 90 % , unity radiative decay in its intrinsic channel , stable ink characteristics , and effective charge injection and transportation in QD films , resulting in the highly efficient QD-based LEDs ( QLEDs). Furthermore , the QD films with less nonradiative recombination centers exhibit improved PL properties with a PLQY of 61 % through dopant engineering in A-site. The robustness of such properties is demonstrated by the fabrication of green electroluminescent LEDs based on CsPbBr
