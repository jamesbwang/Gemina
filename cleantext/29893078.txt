  Carotenoids are a class of terpenes of commercial interest and exert important biological functions. Engineering morphological and biosynthetic aspects of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> cell membrane could improve its storage capacity for β-carotene. However , how the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine , the major component of the cell membrane , was not discussed in detail. In this work , the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine was divided into three modules to discuss their synergetic effect , by expressing in different combinations. Overexpressing the upstream module 1 in CAR016 caused a 30.5 % increase of β-carotene specific production ( from 10.1 mg/g to 13.7 mg/g DCW); combined overexpressing module 1 and module 2 in CAR016 led to a 122 % increase of β-carotene specific production ( from 10.5 mg/g to 22.3 mg/g DCW). The optimal expression combination of the phosphatidylethanolamine synthetic pathway was obtained , which further increased the content of the cell membrane for β-carotene storage , and improved its production. The membrane engineering strategy opens up a new direction for engineering microbial producers for a large spectrum of hydrophobic molecules.
