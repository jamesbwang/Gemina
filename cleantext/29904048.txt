  The responsiveness and predictive validity of the Tablet-based Symbol Digit Modalities Test ( T-SDMT) are unknown , which limits the utility of the T-SDMT in both clinical and research settings. The purpose of this study was to examine the responsiveness and predictive validity of the T-SDMT in inpatients with stroke. A follow-up , repeated-assessments design. One rehabilitation unit at a local medical center. A total of 50 inpatients receiving rehabilitation completed T-SDMT assessments at admission to and discharge from a rehabilitation ward. The median follow-up period was 14 days. The Barthel index ( BI) was assessed at discharge and was used as the criterion of the predictive validity. The mean changes in the T-SDMT scores between admission and discharge were statistically significant ( paired t-test = 3.46 , p = 0.001). The T-SDMT scores showed a nearly moderate standardized response mean ( 0.49). A moderate association ( Pearson 's r = 0.47) was found between the scores of the T-SDMT at admission and those of the BI at discharge , indicating good predictive validity of the T-SDMT. Our results support the responsiveness and predictive validity of the T-SDMT in patients with stroke receiving rehabilitation in hospitals. This study provides empirical evidence supporting the use of the T-SDMT as an outcome measure for assessing processingspeed in inpatients with stroke. The scores of the T-SDMT could be used to predict basic activities of daily living function in inpatients with stroke.
