  We report a multiplex family with a GATA1 gene mutation responsible for a massive fetal cerebral hemorrhage<symptom> occurring at 36 weeks. Two other stillbirth<symptom> cousins presented with fetal hydrops and congenital hemochromatosis ' phenotype at 37 and 12 weeks of gestation. Molecular screening revealed the presence of a c. 613G > A pathogenic allelic variation in exon 4 of GATA1 gene in the 3 male siblings and their carrier mothers. The diagnosis of a GATA1 gene mutation may be suspected in cases of male fetuses with intracerebral bleeding , particularly if a history of prior fetal loss ( es) and mild maternal thrombocytopenia<symptom> are also present.
