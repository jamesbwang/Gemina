  The potential use of different hard and soft parts ( otolith , scale , eye lens , dorsal spine , vertebral bone , muscle , and liver) of Rutilus kutum for biomonitoring of 13 major and trace elements ( Br , Ca , Cl , Cu , Fe , K , Mg , Mn , Na , P , S , Sr , and Zn) was evaluated , for the first time. The specimens were sampled from three sampling sites in the Southern Caspian Sea in May 2016. Twenty specimens were collected from each site. The elements ' concentrations in the samples were measured by proton-induced X-ray emission ( PIXE). In all the hard tissues , except for eye lens , Ca was the most abundant element , whereas Fe was among the least abundant elements. The orders of element occurrence in the two soft tissues were largely similar. Ca , Fe , S , Cl , and K could be detected in all the selected tissues , while Br was detectable only in otolith. Minor similarities among the tissues were identified in the case of eye lens ( concerning P , S , and Zn) and liver ( in terms of Cl , Fe , and K) , whereas , in the case of Sr and Ca , otolith shows the maximum distance. In general , it can be concluded that all the studied hard parts , except for eye lens , may offer alternatives for biomonitoring of Ca , Cl , Fe , K , and S in the southern Caspian Sea. The scales and spines represent a potential non-lethal alternative to the other hard parts.
