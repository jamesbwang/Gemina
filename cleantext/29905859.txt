  We have obtained new crystal structures of Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> topoisomerase I , including structures with ssDNA<pathogen> substrate bound to the active site , with and without Mg2 + ion present. Significant enzyme conformational changes upon DNA binding place the catalytic tyrosine in a pre-transition state position for cleavage of a specific phosphodiester linkage. Meanwhile , the enzyme/DNA complex with bound Mg2 + ion may represent the post-transition state for religation in the enzyme 's multiple-step DNA relaxation catalytic cycle. The first observation of Mg2 + ion coordinated with the TOPRIM residues and DNA phosphate in a type IA topoisomerase active site allows assignment of likely catalytic role for the metal and draws a comparison to the proposed mechanism for type IIA topoisomerases. The critical function of a strictly conserved glutamic acid in the DNA cleavage step was assessed through site-directed mutagenesis. The functions assigned to the observed Mg2 + ion can account for the metal requirement for DNA rejoining but not DNA cleavage by type IA topoisomerases. This work provides new structural insights into a more stringent requirement for DNA rejoining versus cleavage in the catalytic cycle of this essential enzyme , and further establishes the potential for selective interference of DNA rejoining by this validated TB drug target.
