  Motivational interviewing is hypothesized to operate by enhancing a client 's internal motivation to change. Past research operationalizes this process by measuring in-session statements for change ( i.e. , change talk) , yet relationships between change talk and other measures of motivation have yet to be substantiated. This study tested whether in-session change talk predicted subsequent reports of commitment to abstain or moderate drinking assessed via ecological momentary assessment ( EMA) , and explored each of their contributions to drinking outcomes. Secondary data analysis was performed on data from 48 study participants who received therapy within a randomized controlled trial testing mechanisms of actions of MI. Multilevel models were used to test whether in-session commitment statements ( strength , frequency , and slope of strength) made in two therapy sessions predicted subsequent daily reports of commitment to abstain or not drink heavily and drinking ( 21 days of data) in the weeks following each respective session. A weak , negative relationship between in-session commitment and average daily commitment to abstain emerged. No relationship between in-session statements and average daily commitment to not drink heavily emerged. Only EMA commitment predicted drinking outcome. Post hoc analyses demonstrate a moderating impact of EMA commitment to abstain on in-session commitment strength: low pre-treatment commitment to abstain and increasing commitment strength across a session yielded the greatest drink reduction. In-session change talk and EMA commitment may represent distinct aspects of motivation , yet their interaction appears important to treatment prognoses. Commitment to abstain may be important for treatment selection and successful drink reduction.
