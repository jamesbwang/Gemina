  Women are under-represented in radiology , but the implications of this under-representation are poorly understood. Therefore , the purpose of this study was to determine if articles published by women in major radiology journals were more collaborative. Following an institutional review board exemption , we reviewed all original research articles in Radiology , in the American Journal of Roentgenology , and in Academic Radiology from 2011 to 2015. For each article , the gender of the first and the last authors and proxy measures of collaboration were recorded , including the total number of authors , female authors , departments , and institutions. Nominal logistic regression analysis was used to test for associations while controlling for confounders. There were 1934 articles analyzed. Female first and last authors represented 30.2 % ( 585 of 1934) and 24.4 % ( 473 of 1934) of the articles , respectively. A female first author was associated with more female last authors ( 36 % vs 20 % , P < .001) , total female authors ( 2.9 vs 1.2 , P < .001) , and departments ( 3.3 vs 3.0 , P < .001). Similarly , a female last author was associated with more female first authors ( 44 % vs 26 % , P = .001) , total female authors ( 3.1 vs 1.2 , P < .001) , departments ( 3.5 vs 3.0 P < .001) , and institutions ( 2.3 vs 1.9 , P = .006). Each additional female author increased the mean number of institutions by 0.33 and departments by 0.46 on linear regression. First- or last-author gender was not associated with total authors ( P = .17). Original research articles published with a female first or last author were associated with more departments and institutions , but not with the total number of authors , suggesting that women engage in some metrics of more collaborative research.
