  Women with a history of gestational hypertensive disorders ( GHD) are at increased risk for developing perinatal cardiovascular complications ( e.g. , gestational hypertension , preeclampsia , etc.) in subsequent pregnancies. The underlying mechanisms remain uncertain , but impaired maternal left ventricular function may be one contributing factor for these complications. We evaluated the time course of changes in left ventricular function before , during and after pregnancy in women with prior GHD. Sixteen women with a history of GHD ( the high-risk group) , and 25 women without such a history ( controls) were enrolled. Resting hemodynamic and echocardiographic measurements were longitudinally performed prior to pregnancy , during early ( 4-8 weeks of gestation) , late pregnancy ( 32-36 weeks) , and postpartum ( 6-10 weeks after delivery). Pregnancy outcomes were obtained after delivery. At pre-pregnancy , there was no difference in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and heart rate between the groups. Corrected isovolumetric relaxation time was longer , E/e ' was larger , and Tei-index was greater in the high-risk group than controls. Moreover , the rate of GHD during the study was significantly greater in the high-risk group than controls ( Odds Ratio: 8.94 ( 95 % CI: 1.55-51.5) , P = 0.007). Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for age demonstrated that pre-pregnancy E/e ' was an independent predictor for GHD ( P = 0.017). Thus , women with a history of GHD have modestly impaired cardiac function pre-pregnancy compared to controls , which identifies an increased susceptibility to developing cardiovascular complications during a subsequent pregnancy.
