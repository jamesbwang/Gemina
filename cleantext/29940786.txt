  Macroautophagy/autophagy is a conserved transport pathway where targeted structures are sequestered by phagophores , which mature into autophagosomes , and then delivered into lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy is involved in the pathophysiology of numerous diseases and its modulation is beneficial for the outcome of numerous specific diseases. Several lysosomal inhibitors such as bafilomycin A
