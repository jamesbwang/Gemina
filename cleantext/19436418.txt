  The majority of formerly conducted studies have focused on the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder merely during pregnancy period; however , pregnancy period is by itself accompanied with the stress of getting pregnant again; therefore , the present study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) during pregnancy and postpartum period. A total of 3475 articles were found by searching keywords of PTSD , pregnancy , stress , and birth , through various research databases , including PubMed , Google Scholar , and Science Direct; 37 papers turned out to be completely relevant , 18 of which had provided through examination of the prevalence of intended disorder. The prevalence rate varied from 0 % to 21 % in community-related samples; this rate varied from 0 % to 43 % in high-risk samples. PTSD is a common phenomenon during pregnancy and postpartum period , and it might get worse and worse unless it is diagnosed and treated after delivery. Thus , it is recommended to assess pregnancy and postpartum services.
