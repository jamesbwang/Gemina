  There is strong evidence of an association between socioeconomic status ( SES) and end-stage renal disease ( ESRD). However , the association of SES with the risk of chronic kidney disease ( CKD) and the rate of change in kidney function is unclear. A cohort of 14 086 participants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1 .73 m2 at baseline in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study ( 1987-89) were studied. The association of annual household income , educational attainment and neighborhood deprivation with incident ESRD , incident CKD and change in eGFR using four measurements over ∼ 23 years was assessed. A total of 432 participants developed ESRD and 3510 developed CKD over a median follow-up time of ∼ 23 years. After adjustment for demographics and baseline eGFR , the hazard ratio ( HR) for incident ESRD compared with the high-income group was 1.56 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.22-1.99 in the medium-income group and 2.30 ( 95 % CI 1.75-3.02) in the low-income group ( P-trend < 0.001) , and for CKD was 1.10 ( 95 % CI 1.01-1.20) in the medium-income group and 1.30 ( 95 % CI 1.17-1.44) in the low-income group ( P-trend < 0.001). After full adjustments , the HR for ESRD was 1.33 ( 95 % CI 1.03-1.70) in the medium-income group and 1.50 ( 95 % CI 1.14-1.98) in the low-income group ( P-trend = 0.003) and for CKD was 1.01 ( 95 % CI 0.92-1.10) in the medium-income group and 1.04 ( 95 % CI 0.93-1.16) in the low-income group ( P-trend = 0.50). The eGFR decline was 5 % and 15 % steeper in the medium- and low-income groups , respectively , after full adjustment ( P-trend < 0.001). Results were similar , with lower educational attainment and higher neighborhood deprivation being associated with adverse outcomes. SES ( annual household income , educational attainment or neighborhood deprivation) was associated not only with ESRD risk but also with eGFR decline , although the association with CKD appeared weaker.
