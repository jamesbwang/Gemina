  This paper presents the development and evaluation of fuzzy multi-objective optimization for decision-making that includes the process optimization of anaerobic digestion ( AD) process. The operating cost criteria which is a fundamental research gap in previous AD analysis was integrated for the case study in this research. In this study , the mixing ratio of food waste leachate ( FWL) and piggery wastewater ( PWW) , calcium carbonate ( CaCO
