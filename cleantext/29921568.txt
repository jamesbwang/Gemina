  Lipocalin-2 ( Lcn2) has been previously characterized as an adipokine regulating thermogenic activation of brown adipose tissue and retinoic acid ( RA)- induced thermogenesis in mice. The objective of this study was to explore the role and mechanism for Lcn2 in the recruitment and retinoic acid-induced activation of brown-like or `` beige '' adipocytes. We found Lcn2 deficiency reduces key markers of thermogenesis including uncoupling protein-1 ( UCP1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α ( PGC-1α) in inguinal white adipose tissue ( iWAT) and inguinal adipocytes derived from Lcn2-/- mice. Lcn2-/- inguinal adipocytes have attenuated insulin-induced upregulation of thermogenic gene expression and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38MAPK) signaling pathway activation. This is accompanied by a lower basal and maximal oxidative capacity in Lcn2-/- inguinal adipocytes , indicating mitochondrial dysfunction. Recombinant Lcn2 was able to restore insulin-induced p38MAPK phosphorylation in both wild-type ( WT) and Lcn2-/- inguinal adipocytes. Rosiglitazone treatment during differentiation of Lcn2-/- adipocytes is able to recruit beige adipocytes at a normal level , however further activation of beige adipocytes by insulin and RA is impaired in the absence of Lcn2. Further , the synergistic effect of insulin and RA on UCP1 and PGC-1α expression is markedly reduced in Lcn2-/- inguinal adipocytes. Most intriguingly , Lcn2 and the retinoic acid receptor-alpha ( RAR-α) are concurrently translocated to the plasma membrane of adipocytes in response to insulin , and this insulin-induced RAR-α translocation is absent in adipocytes deficient in Lcn2. Our data suggests a novel Lcn2-mediated pathway by which RA and insulin synergistically regulates activation of beige adipocytes via a non-genomic pathway of RA action.
