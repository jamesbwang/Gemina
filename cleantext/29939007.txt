  In this paper , a freestanding flexible nanofibrillated cellulose ( NFC)/ silver ( Ag) composite film with high thermal conductivity ( TC) was prepared using the NFC that was in situ coated with a small amount of Ag nanoparticles through mussel-inspired chemistry of dopamine. The results demonstrated that Ag nanoparticles were homogeneously coated on the surface of NFC nanofibers and their incorporation had little influence on the film-forming ability of NFC. The NFC decorated with Ag nanoparticles could easily form thermally conductive pathways in the composite films , and the resultant films containing only 2.0 vol % of Ag showed a high in-plane TC value of 6.0 W/ ( m Â· K) , which was 4 times that of pure NFC film. Moreover , the composite films exhibited relatively high strength and flexibility. The highly thermally conductive NFC/Ag composite films possess potential applications as lateral heat spreaders in flexible electronic equipment.
