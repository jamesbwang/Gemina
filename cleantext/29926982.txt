  The single-atom transistor represents a quantum electronic device at room temperature , allowing the switching of an electric current by the controlled and reversible relocation of one single atom within a metallic quantum point contact. So far , the device operates by applying a small voltage to a control electrode or `` gate '' within the aqueous electrolyte. Here , the operation of the atomic device in the quasi-solid state is demonstrated. Gelation of pyrogenic silica transforms the electrolyte into the quasi-solid state , exhibiting the cohesive properties of a solid and the diffusive properties of a liquid , preventing the leakage problem and avoiding the handling of a liquid system. The electrolyte is characterized by cyclic voltammetry , conductivity measurements , and rotation viscometry. Thus , a first demonstration of the single-atom transistor operating in the quasi-solid-state is given. The silver single-atom and atomic-scale transistors in the quasi-solid-state allow bistable switching between zero and quantized conductance levels , which are integer multiples of the conductance quantum G
