  This study investigated the effect of blood-contamination on the push-out bond strength of BiodentineTM ( BD) and MTA Angelus Â® ( MTA-A) to root dentin over time. Twenty-five teeth were sectioned horizontally to obtain 120 root slices. The lumens were filled with MTA-A or BD: 60 for each cement ( 30 uncontaminated and 30 blood contaminated). Push out bond strength to dentin was assessed at 24 h ( n = 10) , 7 days ( n = 10) and 28 days ( n = 10). Failure modes were classified as: cohesive , adhesive or mixed failure. Two-way ANOVA was used to investigate the interaction between blood contamination vs. hydration period. Mann Whitney test compared different materials in each period , and it also compared the contaminated versus uncontaminated material for each period. Friedman , followed by Dunn ` s test , compared periods of hydration for each material , regardless of blood contamination. Failure modes were reported descriptively. The interaction hydration period vs. blood contamination was highly significant for MTA-A ( P = 0.001) and it was not significant for BD ( P = 0.474). There were no differences between bond strength of uncontaminated and contaminated BD in any of the periods. Bond strength of uncontaminated MTA-A increased at each time of hydration; but it remained stable over time for blood-contaminated samples. BD had higher bond strength than MTA-A in all periods of hydration. Cohesive failure predominated. Only for MTA-A , the over time bond strength to dentin was affected by blood contamination.
