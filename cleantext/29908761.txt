  Little is known about the health-related quality of life ( HRQOL) following adverse bleeding events associated with antithrombotic drug therapy. This systematic review assesses the HRQOL of patients who suffered a bleeding event related to antithrombotic drug use. A literature search was performed using PubMed , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Library from inception through June 16 , 2017. Studies measuring HRQOL after a bleeding event related to antithrombotic drug therapy for primary or secondary prevention of a thromboembolic event were included. Four studies with a total of 13,209 patients met the inclusion criteria , and of them , 3,649 patients developed a bleeding event. Patients who were included received antithrombotic drugs because of acute myocardial infarction or atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. EQ-5D , SF-36 , and GHP MOS-13 were used to measure HRQOL. The follow-up time ranged from 6 to 29 months. Patients who suffered a bleeding event reported worse HRQOL compared to those who did not ( EQ-5D- average increase on all domains of 0.09 , p-values ranging from < 0.001 to 0.003; SF-36- average decrease on all domains of 21.4 , p < 0.001; and GHP MOS-13 score- decrease of 11.9 points , p < 0.05) and an increased health concern ( 13.4-point increase; p < 0.05). In conclusion , adverse bleeding events occurring because of the use of antithrombotic agents are associated with a clinically relevant lower HRQOL and hence deserve more attention as part of the shared decision-making process between patients and providers. These data should be valuable for facilitating more substantive care and risk discussions regarding potential changes in outcome and rehabilitation.
