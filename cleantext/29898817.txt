  The aim of this study was to investigate whether the promoters of progesterone receptor isoform A ( PGRA) and B ( PGRB) are methylated and to determine the percentage of methylation occurring for each isoform. Genomic DNA was isolated from the corpora lutea ( CL) and endometrial slices from cows on Days 2-5 , 6-10 , 11-16 and 17-20 of the oestrous cycle. DNA was bisulphite-converted and amplified using methyl-specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) with primers that detect both methylated and unmethylated sequences. The determination of the percentage of the methylation was performed using HpaII and MspI restriction enzymes. Methyl-specific PCR showed partial methylation of PGRA and PGRB promoters in the CL and endometrium during the oestrous cycle. Methylation for PGRA was between 15 and 17 % and for PGRB was in the range of 6 to 7.7 % during the oestrous cycle in the CL. In the endometrium , the methylation for PGRA was between 6 and 7.3 % and for PGRB was between 3 and 4.8 % during the oestrous cycle. The data obtained indicate that the higher promoter methylation of the PGRA isoform could be a mechanism for regulation of PGRA inhibitory activity against PGRB and , in this way , methylation may influence the regulation of progesterone action in the CL and endometrium.
