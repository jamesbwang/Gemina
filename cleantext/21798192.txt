  Freshwater mussels ( order: Unionida) represent one of the most critically imperilled groups of animals; consequently , there exists a need to establish a variety of molecular markers for population genetics and systematic studies in this group. Recently , two novel mitochondrial protein-coding genes were described in unionoids with doubly uniparental inheritance of mtDNA. These genes are the
