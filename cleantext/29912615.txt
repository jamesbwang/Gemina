  Crying is often considered to be a positive experience that benefits the crier , yet there is little empirical evidence to support this. Indeed , it seems that people hold a range of appraisals about their crying , and these are likely to influence the effects of crying on their emotional state. This paper reports on the development and psychometric validation of the Beliefs about Crying Scale ( BACS) , a new measure assessing beliefs about whether crying leads to positive or negative emotional outcomes in individual and interpersonal contexts. Using 40 preliminary items drawn from a qualitative study , an exploratory factor analysis with 202 participants ( 50 % female; aged 18-84 years) yielded three subscales: Helpful Beliefs , Unhelpful-Individual Beliefs , and Unhelpful-Social Beliefs , explaining 60 % of the variance in the data. Confirmatory factor analysis on the 14-item scale with 210 participants ( 71 % female; aged 17-48 years) showed a good fit to the three factors. The subscales showed differential relationships with measures of personality traits , crying proneness , emotion regulation and expressivity , and emotional identification ( alexithymia). The BACS provides a nuanced understanding of beliefs about crying in different contexts and helps to explain why crying behaviour may not always represent positive emotion regulation for the crier.
