  Aiming to improve the flame retardancy performance of natural rubber ( NR) , we developed a novel flame retardant synergistic agent through grafting of MCM-41 to graphene oxide ( GO) , named as GO-NH-MCM-41 , as an assistant to intumescent flame retardants ( IFR). The flame retardancy of NR/IFR/GO-NH-MCM -41 composites was evaluated by limited oxygen index ( LOI) , UL-94 , and cone calorimeter test. The LOI value of NR/IFR/GO-NH-MCM -41 reached 26.3 %; the UL-94 ratings improved to a V-0 rating. Moreover , the addition of GO-NH-MCM-41 decreased the peak heat release rate ( PHRR) and the total heat release ( THR) of the natural rubber composites. Furthermore , the addition of GO-NH-MCM-41 increased the thickness of char residue. The images of SEM indicated the char residue was more compact and continuous. The degradation of GO-NH-MCM-41-based NR composites was completed with a mass loss of 35.57 % at 600 & deg; C. The tensile strength and the elongation at break of the NR/IFR/GO-NH-MCM -41 composites were 13.9 MPa and 496.7 % , respectively. The results of the rubber process analyzer ( RPA) reached the maximum value , probably due to a better network of fillers in the matrix.
