  Synthesis of 1,2-annulated-C-aryl glycosides has been achieved in a stereoselective manner through the Diels-Alder reaction between carbohydrate-derived terminally unsubstituted dienes and in situ generated arynes. In these reactions , formation of sugar-fused ( or branched) naphthalenes was also observed and found to be temperature dependent and thus constituting one of the salient features of this work. The synthetic importance of 1,2-annulated-C-aryl glycosides has been explored by transforming them into densely oxygenated products by functionalizing the unsubstituted exo-double bond. Further , 1,2-annulated-C-aryl glycosides give rapid access to C-aryl glycosides in four steps.
