  The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis ( FTS) is a structure-sensitive exothermic reaction that enables catalytic transformation of syngas to high quality liquid fuels. Now , monolithic cobalt-based heterogeneous catalysts were elaborated through a wet chemistry approach that allows control over nanocrystal shape and crystallographic phase , while at the same time enables heat management. Copper and nickel foams have been employed as supports for the epitaxial growth of hcp-Co nanowires directly from a solution containing a coordination compound of cobalt and stabilizing ligands. The Co/Cu
