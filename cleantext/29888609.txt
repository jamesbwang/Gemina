  Traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM) is widely used among Chinese cancer patients. However , little is known about Chinese patients ' expectations and barriers toward using TCM for cancer. We conducted a cross-sectional survey within a patient-support group , the Beijing Anti-Cancer Association. We measured the outcome , Chinese cancer survivors ' expectations and barriers toward TCM utilization , using a modified version of ABCAM ( Attitudes and Beliefs towards Complementary and Alternative Medicine) , the ABTCM ( Attitudes and Beliefs towards Traditional Chinese Medicine). We used multivariate models to evaluate the impact of socioeconomic status and clinical factors on their expectations and barriers ( including treatment concerns and logistical challenges domain) toward TCM. Among 590 participants , most patients expected TCM to boost their immune system ( 96 %) , improve their physical health ( 96 %) , and reduce symptoms ( 94 %). Many had logistical challenges ( difficulty decocting herbs ( 58 %) and finding a good TCM physician ( 55 %)). A few were concerned that TCM might interfere with conventional treatments ( 7.6 %) , and that many TCM treatments are not based on scientific research ( 9.1 %). In the multivariable regression model , age ≤ 60 years was independently associated with higher expectation score ( P = .031). Age ≤ 60 years ( coefficient 5.0 , P = .003) and localized disease ( coefficient 9.5 , P = .001) were both associated with higher treatment concerns. Active employment status ( coefficient 9.0 , P = .008) and localized disease ( coefficient 7.5 , P = .030) were related to more logistical challenges. Age and cancer stage were related to Chinese cancer patients ' perceived expectations and barriers toward TCM use. Understanding these attitudes is important for reshaping the role that TCM plays in China 's patient-centered comprehensive cancer care model.
