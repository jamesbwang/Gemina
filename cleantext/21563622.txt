  There is significant international interest in the economic impacts of persistent inequities in morbidity and mortality. However , very few studies have quantified the costs associated with unfair and preventable ethnic/racial inequities in health. The proposed study will investigate inequities in health between the indigenous Māori and non-Māori adult population in New Zealand ( 15 years and older) and estimate the economic costs associated with these differences. The study will use national collections data that is held by government agencies in New Zealand including hospitalisations , mortality , outpatient consultations , laboratory and pharmaceutical claims , and accident compensation claims. Epidemiological methods will be used to calculate prevalences for Māori and non-Māori , by age-group , gender and socioeconomic deprivation ( New Zealand Deprivation Index) where possible. Rates of ` potentially avoidable ' hospitalisations and mortality as well as ` excess or under ' utilisation of healthcare will be calculated as the difference between the actual rate and that expected if Māori were to have the same rates as non-Māori. A prevalence-based cost-of-illness approach will be used to estimate health inequities and the costs associated with treatment , as well as other financial and non-financial costs ( such as years of life lost) over the person 's lifetime. This analysis has been approved by the University of Auckland Human Participants Research Committee ( Ref: 018621). Dissemination of findings will occur via published peer-reviewed articles , presentations to academic , policy and community-based stakeholder groups and via social media.
