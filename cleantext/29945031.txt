  Many of the small drinking water systems in the US that utilize simple filtration and chlorine disinfection or chlorine disinfection alone are facing disinfection byproduct ( DBP) noncompliance issues , which need immediate upgrades. In this study , four potential upgrade scenarios , namely the GAC , ozone , UV30 , and UV186 scenarios , were designed for a typical small drinking water systems and compared in terms of embodied energy , carbon footprint , and life cycle cost. These scenarios are designed to either reduce the amount of DBP precursors using granular activated carbon filtration ( the GAC scenario) or ozonation ( the ozone scenario) , or replace the chlorine disinfection with the UV disinfection at different intensities followed by chloramination ( the UV30 and UV186 scenarios). The UV30 scenario was found to have the lowest embodied energy ( 417 GJ/year) and life cycle cost ( $ 0.25 million US dollars) , while the GAC scenario has the lowest carbon footprint ( 21 Mg CO
