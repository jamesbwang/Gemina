  The origin of the intercalated cushions that develop into the anterior cusp of the pulmonary valve ( PV) and the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve ( AV) is not well understood. Cre transgenes in combination with the Rosa TdTomato-EGFP reporter were used to generate three-dimensional lineage mapping of AV and PV cusps during intercalated cushion development. Tie2-Cre; EGFP was used to mark endothelial-derived mesenchymal cells , Wnt1-Cre; EGFP for cardiac neural crest and cardiac Troponin T ( Tnnt2) Cre; EGFP , for myocardial lineage. The highest percentage of intercalated cushion cells at embryonic day ( E) 12.5 was Tnnt2-Cre; EGFP positive; 68.0 % for the PV and 50.0 % AV. Neither Tnnt2 mRNA nor Tnnt2-Cre protein was expressed in the intercalated cushions; and the Tnnt2-Cre lineage intercalated cushion cells were also positive for the mesenchymal markers Sox9 and versican. Tnnt2-Cre lineage was present within the forming intercalated cushions from E11 .5 and was present in the intercalated cushion derived PV and AV cusps and localized to the fibrosa layer at postnatal day 0. Intercalated cushions of the developing outflow tract are populated with Tnnt2-Cre derived cells , a Cre reporter previously used for tracing and excision of myocardial cells and not previously associated with mesenchymal cells.
