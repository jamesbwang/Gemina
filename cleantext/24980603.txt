  Superior sulcus tumor of the lung is a bronchogenic tumor occurred in the apex of the upper lobe of the lung and is a unique clinical subtype of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) , which account for less than 5 % of all bronchogenic carcinomas. It often involves the first rib , brachial plexus , subclavian vessels , sympathetic chain , stellate ganglion or vertebra. A lot of progress has been achieved in the treatment of superior sulcus tumor over the past decades. Several clinical trials reported in recent years have confirmed that concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection can improve the rate of complete resection , local control and pathological remission of the tumor , and prolong the total-survival time. It has become the most effective treatment mode for the superior sulcus tumor , and recommended as a standard treatment mode for superior sulcus tumor by National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN) and American College of Chest Physicians ( ACCP) guidelines. This article reviews relevant literatures at home and abroad , and briefly introduces the advances in surgical treatment and comprehensive treatment of superior sulcus tumor..
