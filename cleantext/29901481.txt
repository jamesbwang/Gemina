  Allograft reconstruction of large segmental intercalary bone defects after tumor resection is a well-accepted surgical technique. Although results generally have been satisfactory , nonunion at the allograft-host bone junction site remains a notable concern. Various reports have described attempts to enhance junctional healing with a variety of complex osteotomies , often complicating an already complex procedure. The use of an innovative reverse reaming technique can decrease the level of intraoperative difficulty mating the allograft-host junction and theoretically may improve junctional healing by enhancing stability and increasing the contact surface area.
