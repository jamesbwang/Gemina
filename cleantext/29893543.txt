  Inhibition of the self-assembly process of amyloid-beta and even more the removal of already existing toxic amyloid-beta assemblies represent promising therapeutic strategies against Alzheimer 's disease. To approach this aim , we selected a d-enantiomeric peptide by phage-display based on the interaction with amyloid-beta monomers. This lead compound was successfully optimized by peptide microarrays with respect to its affinity and specificity to the target resulting in d-peptides with both increased hydrophobicity and net charge. Here , we present a detailed biophysical characterization of the interactions between these optimized d-peptides and amyloid-beta monomers in comparison to the original lead compound in order to obtain a more thorough understanding of the physicochemical determinants of the interactions. Kinetics and apparent stoichiometry of complex formation were studied using surface plasmon resonance. Potential modes of binding to amyloid-beta were identified , and the influences of ionic strength on complex stability , as well as on the inhibitory effect on amyloid-beta aggregation were investigated. The results reveal a very different mode of interaction of the optimized d-peptides based on a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions as compared to the mostly electrostatically driven interaction of the lead compound. These conclusions were supported by the thermodynamic profiles of the interaction between optimized d-peptides and AÎ² monomers , which indicate an increase in binding entropy with respect to the lead compound.
