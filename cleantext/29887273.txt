  Adult degenerative scoliosis ( ADS) surgery is known for its high incidence of complications. The propose of this study was to determine current complication rates and the predictors of medical complications in surgical ASD patients. A retrospective study of 153 ADS patients who underwent long level spinal fusion with 2-year follow-up between 2012 and 2017. The patient- and surgical-related risk factors for each individual medical complication were identified by using univariate testing. All patients were divided into groups with and without medical complication , infection , neurological complications , and cardiopulmonary complications , respectively. Potential risk factors were identified using univariate testing. Multivariate Logistic regression was used to evaluate independent predictors of medical complications. The total medical complication incidence was 26.1 %. Patient-related independent risk factors for the development of medical complications included diabetes , smoking; for infection were diabetes and smoking; for neurological complications were BMI and diabetes; for cardiopulmonary complications were hypertension , smoking and cardiac comorbidity. Surgical-related independent risk factors for the development of medical complications were fusion level , operative time , osteotomy , blood transfusion and LOS; for infection were fusion level , blood transfusion , and LOS; for neurological complication were fusion level , osteotomy and blood transfusion; for cardiopulmonary complication were fusion level. Diabetes and smoking were the most common patient-related independent risk factors increase the development of each individual medical complication. On the other hand , fusion levels and blood transfusion were the most common surgical-related independent risk factors increase the development of each individual medical complication. Prevention of these risk factors can reduce the incidence of complications in Chinese patients with ADS surgery.
