  Phytochemical investigation on the roots of Swietenia macrophylla yielded one new pharagmalin-type limonoid named 2-dehydroxyl-swietephragmin C ( 1) and one new xanthone , 1,5-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-6 ' ,6 '- dimethyl-2H-pyrano ( 2 ' ,3 ': 3,2) xanthone ( 2) , in addition to three known compounds. The structures of the new compounds were unambiguously determined by comprehensive spectroscopic methods ( NMR , UV , IR , MS) , as well as by comparison with the reported data in the literature. Xanthones were reported from Swietenia genus for the first time.
