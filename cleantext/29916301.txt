  Objectives Fingertip amputation is often encountered in emergency departments , especially in hospitals located near industrial areas. Replantation of the fingertip can be considered when the normal architecture is preserved in cases of sharp amputation. The goal of replantation is to preserve cosmesis and function , especially for the thumb because of its involvement in grasping and the key pinch. Even when microsurgical vascular anastomosis is applied , the absence of venous anastomosis along with the high rate of failure of arterial anastomosis in zone 1A fingertip amputation may lead to replantation failure. Methods We herein present a case report of thumb tip amputation salvaged via a modified cross-finger technique. The recipient site was on the ipsilateral radial side of the intermediate phalanx of the middle finger. Results The thumb tip was successfully replanted with no vascular anastomosis , and this new technique prevented stiffness in the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the thumb and middle finger. Conclusions This procedure can be performed in local clinics and emergency departments without the need for arterial and venous anastomoses.
