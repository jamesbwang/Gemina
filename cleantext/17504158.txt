  Neuroendocrine tumours ( NET) consist of a heterogeneous group of neoplasms with various organs of origin. At diagnosis 21 % of the patients with a Grade 1 NET and 30 % with a Grade 2 NET have distant metastases. Treatment with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy ( PRRT) shows a high objective response rate and long median survival after treatment. However , complete remission is almost never achieved. The liver is the most commonly affected organ in metastatic disease and is the most incriminating factor for patient survival. Additional treatment of liver disease after PRRT may improve outcome in NET patients. Radioembolization is an established therapy for liver metastasis. To investigate this hypothesis , a phase 2 study was initiated to assess effectiveness and toxicity of holmium-166 radioembolization ( The HEPAR PLUS trial ( `` Holmium Embolization Particles for Arterial Radiotherapy Plus This is the first prospective study to combine PRRT with Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02067988 , 13 February 2014.
