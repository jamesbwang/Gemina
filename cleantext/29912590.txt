  Obesity is a major public health crisis among both children and adults and contributes to significant physical , psychological , and economic burden. We aim to investigate the effect of duration of breastfeeding on excessive weight and obesity at 6 years of age. Data on breastfeeding and child anthropometric measurements were collected in a birth-cohort study in Murcia , Spain ( n = 350). Breastfeeding status and body mass index ( BMI) were established according to WHO definitions. Other factors potentially related to children 's weight were considered. Multiple log-linear and ordinal regressions were used to analyze the effects of breastfeeding on overweight and obesity when considering potential confounders. 33 % and 17.3 % of children in the study were of excess weight and obesity , respectively. Univariate predictors of BMI in children aged 6 were as follows: pregestational maternal BMI ( kg/m The delay of bottle feeding introduction may have a protective effect against obesity at 6 years of age. Our findings reinforce the need for greater support of breastfeeding and to promote a healthy environment and antipoverty interventions during pregnancy and infancy , alongside other strategies for obesity prevention.
