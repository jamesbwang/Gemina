  In the field of immunotherapy , essential progress was achieved over the past years partially demonstrating long lasting therapeutic responses in different tumor entities. A better understanding of the interactions between the tumor and the immune system as well as the integration of immunotherapeutic approaches into clinical routine were the foundations for this development. The different approaches intervene on multiple levels of the immune response and directly or indirectly mount the patient 's own immune defense against tumor cells. Immunotherapeutic approaches are represented by cytokine therapies , vaccinations , the use of oncolytic viruses and monoclonal antibody therapies as well as adoptive cell transfer strategies.
