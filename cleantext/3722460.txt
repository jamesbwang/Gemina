  The peripheral sensory system is critical to regulating motor plasticity and motor recovery. Peripheral electrical stimulation ( ES) can generate constant and adequate sensory input to influence the excitability of the motor cortex. The aim of this proof of concept study was to assess whether ES prior to each hand function training session for eight weeks can better improve neuromuscular control and hand function in chronic stroke individuals and change electroencephalography-electromyography ( EEG-EMG) coherence , as compared to the control ( sham ES). We recruited twelve subjects and randomly assigned them into ES and control groups. Both groups received 20-minute hand function training twice a week , and the ES group received 40-minute ES on the median nerve of the affected side before each training session. The control group received sham ES. EEG , EMG and Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( FMA) were collected at four different time points. The corticomuscular coherence ( CMC) in the ES group at fourth weeks was significantly higher ( p = 0.004) as compared to the control group. The notable increment of FMA at eight weeks and follow-up was found only in the ES group. The eight-week rehabilitation program that implemented peripheral ES sessions prior to function training has a potential to improve neuromuscular control and hand function in chronic stroke individuals.
