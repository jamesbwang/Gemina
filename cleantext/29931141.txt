  The majority of the inter-residue distances in a protein structure are correlated given a fixed topology. Here , we investigate whether we are able to predict a structure 's folding rate , which is known to depend on the complexity of its fold , while considering only a small , uncorrelated fraction of its contacts. We define an expression for the probabilistic information content associated to the relative position of a pair of amino acid residues in a protein structure. By means of fitting the protein chain to a self-avoiding random walk model , we derive a probability distribution for the distance between residues as a function of their separation along the sequence. We then show that the average information content for all residue pairs in a structure , considered as an estimate of its fold 's complexity , is well correlated to the logarithm of its folding rate. Moreover , the same information content measure may be exploited to rank contacts and identify redundancies , allowing the prediction the structure 's folding rate with similar accuracy while taking into account less than 5 % of its contacts. An implementation of the described model and the experimental data are available at http://github.com/luciano-censoni/sarw-lnkf.
