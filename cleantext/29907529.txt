  In this study , the precursor effect for iturin A production was quantitatively analyzed. A strain identified as Bacillus<pathogen> amyloliquefaciens BPD1 ( Ba-BPD1) was selected due to its ability to produce iturin A. The enhancement of iturin A production in a submerged culture was tested using various additives , including palmitic acid , oils , and complex amino acids. Among these , complex amino acids triggered the highest yield at 559 mg/L. The respective amino acids that contribute to the structure of iturin A were used as precursors. In fact , it was found that the addition of l-proline , l-glutamine , l-asparagine and l-serine could improve iturin A yield in the defined medium. However , during the kinetic analysis , all the amino acids exhibited a lower saturation level than l-serine , which exhibited a high saturation level at 1.2 % resulting in an iturin A yield of 914 mg/L. In contrast , a negative effect was observed following the addition of l-tyrosine. To analyze the kinetic behavior of l-serine , three kinetic models were adopted: the kinetic order equation , the Langmuir kinetic equation , and a modified logistic equation. The regression results showed that the modified logistic model was the best fit for the kinetic behavior of l-serine as the major precursor , which could be further referred to the biosynthesis pathway of iturin A. Among the proposed processes for iturin A production , this study achieved the highest iturin A levels as a result of the addition of precursors.
