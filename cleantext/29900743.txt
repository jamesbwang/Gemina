  Digestive endoscopy is the most effective tool available for the diagnosis of multiple gastrointestinal ( GI) tract conditions , and it represents a key aspect in the training of gastroenterology residents according to the Spanish MIR ( médico interno residente) program. The Sociedad Española de Endoscopia Digestiva ( SEED) , aware of all the technical advances that have emerged during the past few years , deems it necessary to define a program of the skills specialists-in-training in gastroenterology should acquire during their residency. This paper describes the goals of endoscopy training , the techniques that should be mastered , and the diagnostic and therapeutic skills this specialty requires. Finally , a model is suggested for the assessment of competence.
