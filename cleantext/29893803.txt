  The association between depression<symptom> care adequacy and the risk of subsequent adverse cardiovascular disease ( CVD) outcomes among patients with a previous diagnosis of myocardial infarction ( MI) or stroke is not well defined. This retrospective cohort study used commercial claims data ( 2010-2015) and included adults with newly diagnosed and treated MDD following an initial MI or stroke diagnosis. Depression<symptom> care adequacy was assessed during the 3-month period following the MDD diagnosis index date using two measures: antidepressant dosage adequacy and duration adequacy. Cox models adjusted for the propensity of receiving adequate depression<symptom> care were used to compare the risk of a composite CVD outcome ( MI , stroke , congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CHF) , and angina) as well as each individual CVD event between patients receiving adequate versus inadequate depression<symptom> care. 1568 patients were included in the final cohort. Of these , 937 ( 59.8 %) were categorized as receiving inadequate depression<symptom> care based on at least 1 of the 2 treatment adequacy criteria. Propensity score adjusted Cox models showed that depression<symptom> care inadequacy was associated with a significantly higher risk of the composite CVD endpoint ( HR , 1.20; 95 % CI , 1.04-1.39) , stroke ( HR 1.20 , 95 % CI , 1.02-1.42) and angina ( HR 1.95 , 95 % CI , 1.21-3.16) with no significant interaction based on cohort included ( MI vs. stroke) or the definition of inadequate depression<symptom> ( dose vs. duration inadequacy) ( Pinteraction > 0.05). Inadequate MDD care was associated with a higher risk of adverse CVD events. These findings reveal a significant unmet clinical need in patients with post-MI or post-stroke MDD that may impact CVD outcomes.
