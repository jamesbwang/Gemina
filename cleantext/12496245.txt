  The different cytoskeleton systems and their connecting molecular motors<symptom> move vesicles and intracellular organelles to shape cells. Polarized cells with specialized functions display an exquisite spatio-temporal regulation of both cytoskeletal and organelle arrangements that support their specific tasks. In particular , T cells rapidly change their shape and cellular function through the establishment of cell surface and intracellular polarity in response to a variety of cues. This review focuses on the contribution of the microtubule-based dynein/dynactin motor complex , the tubulin and actin cytoskeletons , and different organelles to the formation of the antigen-driven immune synapse.
