  China is one of the fastest-growing economies of the late 20th and early 21st centuries , and heavy metal emissions have increased in parallel with rapid industrialization and urbanization. Over the last decade , several studies of geochemical records from peat have reconstructed changes in atmospheric metal pollution in China. We review the peat records that detail the history of atmospheric metal pollution over the last two centuries in NE China. The ecological risk ( ER) of accumulated metals and their potential eco-toxicological effects , through threshold and probable effect concentrations ( TEC and PEC) , are also evaluated. Peat records of metals show an increase of pollution loads in the environment over the pre-industrial level during the past two centuries , with an unprecedented increase in China over the last 60 years. There is generally good agreement between geochemical peat records from NE China and others records elsewhere in China. However , some discrepancies are observed especially with Hg records from lake sediments. These discrepancies could be explained by several factors , including post-depositional processes or uncertainties arising from dating methods. The ecological risk of heavy metals is found to be relatively weak in the remote and high-altitude environment in NE China. Although , most metals are under the TEC , Pb concentrations usually surpass it and are getting close to the PEC which indicates increasing ecological risks. Some areas of improvement have been highlighted such as the need for more long-term studies on atmospheric metals and a greater number of Pb isotopes records to better capture the long history of human activity and the spatial variability in metal deposition of the region.
