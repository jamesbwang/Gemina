  Nurse engagement is a modifiable element of the work environment and has shown promise as a potential safety intervention. Our study examined the relationship between the level of engagement , staffing , and assessments of patient safety among nurses working in hospital settings. A secondary analysis of linked cross-sectional data was conducted using survey data of 26960 nurses across 599 hospitals in 4 states. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between nurse engagement , staffing , and nurse assessments of patient safety. Thirty-two percent of nurses gave their hospital a poor or failing patient safety grade. In 25 % of hospitals , nurses fell in the least or only somewhat engaged categories. A 1-unit increase in engagement lowered the odds of an unfavorable safety grade by 29 % ( P < .001). Hospitals where nurses reported higher levels of engagement were 19 % ( P < .001) less likely to report that mistakes were held against them. Nurses in poorly staffed hospitals were 6 % more likely to report that important information about patients `` fell through the cracks '' when transferring patients across units ( P < .001). Interventions to improve nurse engagement and adequate staffing serve as strategies to improve patient safety.
