  The pharmacokinetic profiles of florfenicol ( FF) or florfenicol amine ( FFA) in crucian carp were compared at different water temperatures after single intramuscular administration of FF at 10 mg/kg bodyweight. The concentrations of FF and FFA were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography method , and then , the concentration versus time data were subjected to compartmental analysis using a one-compartment open model. At the water temperatures of 10 , 20 , and 25 Â°C , the peak concentrations ( C
