  The strength model of self-control is one of the most influential and well-established models of self-regulation in social psychology. However , recent attempts to replicate the ego depletion effect have sometimes failed. The goal of this study is to investigate self-reported replication rates and the frequency of a set of questionable research practices ( QRP) in ego depletion research. A literature search resulted in 1721 researchers who had previously published on ego depletion. They were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. The respondents ( n = 277) , on average , had published over three papers on ego depletion , and had completed more than two additional , unpublished studies. Respondents indicated that in more than 40 % of their studies , results were similar in magnitude to those reported in the existing literature , and more than 60 % reported conducting a priori power analyses. 39.2 % of respondents were aware of other researchers who engaged in the surveyed QRP 's , while 37.7 % affirmed to have employed said QRP 's. These results underline the importance of reducing QRP 's to reliably test the validity of the ego depletion effect.
