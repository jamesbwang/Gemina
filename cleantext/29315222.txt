  The corrosion process of AZ91D magnesium alloy in simulated haze aqueous solution has been studied by electrochemical measurements , immersion tests and morphology characterization. Results show that AZ91D was corroded heavily in simulated haze aqueous solution due to the loose and breakable product film on the surface providing little corrosion barrier. The effect of different ions was investigated. It was found that both N O 3 & minus; and N H 4 + played an important role in the corrosion process. N O 3 & minus; helped to form passive film to protect the matrix , yet N H 4 + consumed OH
