  The lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A ( KDM1A) was the first demethylase to challenge the concept of the irreversible nature of methylation marks. KDM1A , containing a flavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD)- dependent amine oxidase domain , demethylates histone 3 lysine 4 and histone 3 lysine 9 ( H3K4me1/2 and H3K9me1/2). It has emerged as an epigenetic developmental regulator and was shown to be involved in carcinogenesis. The functional diversity of KDM1A originates from its complex structure and interactions with transcription factors , promoters , enhancers , oncoproteins , and tumor-associated genes ( tumor suppressors and activators). In this review , we discuss the microenvironment of KDM1A in cancer progression that enables this protein to activate or repress target gene expression , thus making it an important epigenetic modifier that regulates the growth and differentiation potential of cells. A detailed analysis of the mechanisms underlying the interactions between KDM1A and the associated complexes will help to improve our understanding of epigenetic regulation , which may enable the discovery of more effective anticancer drugs.
