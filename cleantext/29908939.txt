  Budesonide is a hydrophobic glucocorticoid with high anti-inflammatory activity for the treatment of asthma , inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis<disease>. A micellar drug-delivery system based on lipid-DNA may provide a strategy to maximize its drug efficacy and reduce adverse effects. In this work , we report the use of lipid-DNAA ( UU11mer) , featuring two hydrophobic alkyl chains and forming micelles at a comparatively low critical micelle concentration , to render budesonide water-soluble with a high loading capacity ( LC). The inhibition of interleukin-8 ( IL-8) release shows that the new delivery system retains the inhibitory activity in cell-based assays. In conclusion , this research provides a novel approach to formulate and administer budesonide in a non-invasive manner , which dramatically improves its water-solubility while retaining its bioavailability.
