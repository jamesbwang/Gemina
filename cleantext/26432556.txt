  Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> is a leading cause for hospitalisation and for readmission , especially in patients over the age of 65. Diabetes is an increasingly common companion to heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The presence of diabetes and its associated comorbidity increases the risk of adverse outcomes and premature mortality in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. In particular , patients with diabetes are more likely to be readmitted to hospital soon after discharge. This may partly reflect the greater severity of heart disease in these patients. In addition , agents that reduce the chances of readmission such as Î²-blockers , renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers , and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are underutilised because of the perceived increased risks of adverse drug reactions and other limitations. In some cases , readmission to hospital is precipitated by acute decompensation of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( re-exacerbation) leading to pulmonary<symptom> congestion<symptom> and/or refractory oedema. However , it appears that for most of the patients admitted and then discharged with a primary diagnosis of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , most readmissions are not due to heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , but rather due to comorbidity including arrhythmia , infection , adverse drug reactions , and renal impairment/reduced hydration. All of these are more common in patients who also have diabetes , and all may be partly preventable. The many different reasons for readmission underline the critical value of multidisciplinary comprehensive care in patients admitted with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , especially those with diabetes. A number of new strategies are also being developed to address this area of need , including the use of SGLT2 inhibitors , novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists , and neprilysin inhibitors.
