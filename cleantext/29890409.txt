  While Prussian Blue ( PB) analogues are attractive catalysts for activating peroxymonosulfate ( PMS) , PB analogues are very small and thus difficult for recovery. Immobilizing PB particles onto graphene is a useful technique which facilitates recovery and also enhances catalytic activities. As doping graphene with sulfur/nitrogen ( S/N) increases its electro-conductivity and active sites , the composite of PB and S/N-doped graphene should enhance PMS activation. Thus , this study aims to fabricate such a composite. Unlike conventional S/N-doped graphene prepared via post-modifications , trithiocyanuric acid is used as a precursor , which is converted to S-doped graphitic carbon nitride ( SCN). The composite of PB and SCN ( PBSCN) is then fabricated by growing a cobalt-based PB analogue on SCN. The resulting PBSCN preserves the crystalline structures , textural properties and catalytic sites of PB and SCN. As degradation of Acid Red 27 ( AR) is used as a model reaction , PBSCN exhibits a higher catalytic activity than PB and SCN individually , as well as Co
