  The neural mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of lamotrigine in bipolar depression<symptom> are still unexplored. This preliminary study compares the effects of a 12-week treatment with lamotrigine on brain volumes in adults with bipolar disorder ( BD) .12 BD type II patients ( age: 49.33 ± 9.95 years , 3 males , 9 females) and 12 age and gender-matched healthy controls ( HC) ( HC; age: 41 ± 8.60 years , 3 males , 9 females). BD patients were initially administered 25 mg/day of lamotrigine , which was progressively escalated to 200 mg/d. BD participants underwent brain imaging prior to and following lamotrigine treatment. A 50 % reduction in depressive scores indicated `` remission ''. Bayesian general linear models controlled for age , gender and intracranial volume were used to examine changes in relevant brain region following treatment. A posterior probability > 0.90 indicated evidence that there was an effect of diagnosis or remission on brain volumes. Probability distributions of interaction effects between remission and time indicated that BD responders displayed decreased amygdala , cerebellum and nucleus accumbens volumes following lamotrigine treatment. No serious adverse side effects were reported. The antidepressant effects of lamotrigine may be linked to volumetric changes in brain regions involved in mood and emotional regulation. These findings are preliminary and replication in a larger sample is warranted.
