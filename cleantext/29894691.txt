  The antitumor effector T helper 1 ( Th1) and Th17 cells represent two T cell paradigms: short-lived cytolytic Th1 cells and `` stem cell-like '' memory Th17 cells. We report that Th9 cells represent a third paradigm-they are less-exhausted , fully cytolytic , and hyperproliferative. Only tumor-specific Th9 cells completely eradicated advanced tumors , maintained a mature effector cell signature with cytolytic activity as strong as Th1 cells , and persisted as long as Th17 cells in vivo. Th9 cells displayed a unique Pu.1-Traf6-NF-ÎºB activation-driven hyperproliferative feature , suggesting a persistence mechanism rather than an antiapoptotic strategy. Th9 antitumor efficacy depended on interleukin-9 and upregulated expression of Eomes and Traf6. Thus , tumor-specific Th9 cells are a more effective CD4
