  Phosphatidic acid ( PA) is the simplest glycerophospholipid naturally occurring in living organisms , and even though its content among other cellular lipids is minor , it is drawing more and more attention due to its multiple biological functions. PA is a precursor for other phospholipids , acts as a lipid second messenger and , due to its structural properties , is also a modulator of membrane shape. Although much is known about interaction of PA with its effectors , the molecular mechanisms remain unresolved to a large degree. Throughout many of the well-characterized PA cellular sensors , no conserved binding domain can be recognized. Moreover , not much is known about the cellular dynamics of PA and how it is distributed among subcellular compartments. Remarkably , PA can play distinct roles within each of these compartments. For example , in the nucleus it behaves as a mitogen , influencing gene expression regulation , and in the Golgi membrane it plays a role in membrane trafficking. Here , we discuss how a biophysical experimental approach enabled PA behavior to be described in the context of a lipid bilayer and to what extent various physicochemical conditions may modulate the functional properties of this lipid. Understanding these aspects would help to unravel specific mechanisms of PA-driven membrane transformations and protein recruitment and thus would lead to a clearer picture of the biological role of PA..
