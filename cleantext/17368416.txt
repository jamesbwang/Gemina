  The Intercollegiate Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons ( MRCS) examination is undertaken by large numbers of trainees in the UK and internationally as a mandatory step within surgical training. Unlike some high-stakes medical examinations , the MRCS is yet to be validated. A quantitative study was undertaken to assess its predictive validity by investigating the relationship between MRCS ( Parts A and B) and national selection interview scores for general and vascular surgery in the UK. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine the linear relationship between each assessment , and linear regression analyses were employed to identify potential independent predictors of the national selection score. All UK medical graduates who attempted the interview in 2011-2015 were included. Some 84 · 4 per cent of the candidates ( 1231 of 1458) were matched with MRCS data. There was a significant positive correlation between the first attempt score at Part B of the MRCS examination and the national selection score ( r = 0 · 38 , P < 0 · 001). In multivariable analysis , 17 per cent of variance in the national selection first attempt score was explained by the Part B MRCS score and number of attempts ( change in R This study supports validity of the MRCS examination , and indicates its predictive value regarding entry into specialist training.
