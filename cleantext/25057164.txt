  This study investigated the effects of diabetes and antidiabetic medications on the risk of pancreatic cancer ( PaC). We extracted data on Koreans with newly diagnosed diabetes and selected age- and sex-matched controls provided by the National Health Insurance Corporation. Incident PaC was defined as a new registration in the Korea Central Cancer Registry under ICD-10 C25 with admission history until 2015. During 19,429,617.1 person-years , 8,589 PaCs were identified in 1,005,409 subjects for diabetes group and 4,021,636 subjects for control group. The diabetes group showed more than a two-fold risk for PaC compared with the control group. Among antidiabetic medications , metformin , thiazolidinedione , and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor exposure was associated with decreased risk for future PaC ( hazard ratio ( 95 % confidence interval) = 0.86 ( 0.77-0.96) , 0.82 ( 0.68-0.98) , 0.57 ( 0.51-0.64) , respectively) , whereas sulfonylurea and insulin exposure was related to increased risk ( hazard ratio ( 95 % CI) = 1.73 ( 1.57-1.91) , 2.86 ( 1.43-5.74) , respectively) compared to subjects with no drug exposure. Moreover , subjects with dual exposure history to metformin plus thiazolidinedione or metformin plus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor had a lower risk of PaC compared to metformin-only treated subjects. In conclusion , Korean adults with diabetes are at higher risk of PaC compared with nondiabetic individuals , and this risk may be modified by antidiabetic medications.
