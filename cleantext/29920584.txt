  Regional variability in HIV<pathogen> care engagement remains underexplored. Multiple logistic models compared HIV-outcomes for participants from five Southern ( n = 557) and six Non-Southern sites ( n = 670). Southern participants had less viral suppression ( aOR = 0.59; 95 % CI = 0.43-0.82) and higher likelihood of CD4 + < 200 cells/Âµl; ( aOR = 1.49; 95 % CI = 1.14-1.94). HIV<pathogen> interventions and social safety net programs should be expanded.
