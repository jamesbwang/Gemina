  Chemokine ( C-C motif) ligand 7 ( CCL7) , a CC chemokine , is a chemotactic factor and attractant for various kinds of leukocytes , including monocytes and neutrophils. CCL7 is widely expressed in multiple cell types and can participate in anti-inflammatory responses through binding to its receptors to mediate the recruitment of immune cells. Abnormal CCL7 expression is associated with certain immune diseases. Furthermore , CCL7 plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. CCL7 promotes tumor progression by supporting the formation of the tumor microenvironment and facilitating tumor invasion and metastasis , although some studies have suggested that CCL7 has tumor suppressor effects. In this review , we summarize the currently available information regarding the influence of CCL7 on tumors.
