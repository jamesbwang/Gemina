  The present study determined the expression and biological functions of FOXA2 gene in colon cancer in tissues , cells and animals. A total of 66 patients with colon cancer were included in the present study. Using The Human Protein Atlas database , expression and distribution of FOXA2 in colon cancer tissues were analyzed. Using immunohistochemistry , the expression and distribution of FOXA2 in colon cancer cells were studied. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR) was performed to determine the expression of FOXA2 mRNA in colon cancer tissues. Following
