  We aimed to refine the value of CDX2 as an independent prognostic and predictive biomarker in colorectal cancer ( CRC) according to disease stage and chemotherapy sensitivity in preclinical models. CDX2 expression was evaluated in 1045 stage I-IV primary CRCs by gene expression ( n = 403) or immunohistochemistry ( n = 642) and in relation to 5-year relapse-free survival ( RFS) , overall survival ( OS) , and chemotherapy. Pharmacogenomic associations between CDX2 expression and 69 chemotherapeutics were assessed by drug screening of 35 CRC cell lines. CDX2 expression was lost in 11.6 % of cases and showed independent poor prognostic value in multivariable models. For individual stages , CDX2 was prognostic only in stage IV , independent of chemotherapy. Among stage I-III patients not treated in an adjuvant setting , CDX2 loss was associated with a particularly poor survival in the BRAF-mutated subgroup , but prognostic value was independent of microsatellite instability status and the consensus molecular subtypes In stage III , the 5-year RFS rate was higher among patients with loss of CDX2 who received adjuvant chemotherapy than among patients who did not. The CDX2-negative cell lines were significantly more sensitive to chemotherapeutics than CDX2-positive cells , and the multidrug resistance genes MDR1 and CFTR were significantly downregulated both in CDX2-negative cells and patient tumors.
