  The analysis of the periodic table of elements by Jan Scholten opened the way for a new kind of classification and repertorisation of homeopathic remedies. Thereby , group analysis ( resorting to series and stages) makes precise prescriptions possible. This approach appears to yield striking results , even in severe cases. Whereas Hahnemann stressed the emotional state ( ` Gemüthssymptome ' , Organon § 210) when choosing a remedy , Scholten 200 years later investigated the mental picture that represents a life conflict or even a life theme that may maintain the disease process. The person 's environment , emotional traumas or a conflict drives him or her to suppress and dissect painful emotions. Such compensations can become subconscious and so strong that they can no longer be controlled; they then influence the patient with a highly destructive energy. We present five case reports , each dealing with an unusual clinical course of severe cancer associated with homeopathic treatment using the Scholten method. By presenting these cases , we consider how the constitution ( lifelong signs and symptoms of the patient) and the mental state are interwoven and , as a complex mechanism , might provoke disease. The appropriate homeopathic remedy , reflecting the Scholten approach , seemed to have beneficial impact on the disease process of the five individuals presented.
