  Intrauterine transfusion for severe alloimmunization in pregnancy performed before 20 weeks ' gestation is associated with a higher fetal death rate. Intravenous immunoglobulins may prevent hemolysis<symptom> and could therefore be a non-invasive alternative for early transfusions. We evaluated whether maternal treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins defers the development of severe fetal anemia<symptom> and its consequences in a retrospective cohort to which 12 fetal therapy centers contributed. We included consecutive pregnancies of alloimmunized women with a history of severe hemolytic disease and by propensity analysis compared index pregnancies treated with intravenous immunoglobulins ( n = 24) with pregnancies managed without intravenous immunoglobulins ( n = 28) ,. In index pregnancies with intravenous immunoglobulin treatment , fetal anemia<symptom> developed on average 15 days later compared to previous pregnancies ( 8 % less often before 20 weeks ' gestation). In pregnancies without intravenous immunoglobulin treatment anemia<symptom> developed 9 days earlier compared to previous pregnancies ( 10 % more before 20 weeks) , an adjusted 4-day between-group difference in favor of the immunoglobulin group ( 95 % CI -10 to 18 , P = .564). In the subcohort in which immunoglobulin treatment was started before 13 weeks , anemia<symptom> developed 25 days later and 31 % less before 20 weeks ' gestation ( 54 % compared to 23 %) than in the previous pregnancy. Fetal hydrops occurred in 4 % of immunoglobulin-treated pregnancies and in 24 % of those without intravenous immunoglobulin treatment ( OR 0.03 , 95 % CI 0 to 0.5 , P = .011). Exchange transfusions were given to 9 % of neonates born from pregnancies with and in 37 % without immunoglobulin treatment ( OR 0.1 , 95 % CI 0 to 0.5 , P = .009). Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in mothers pregnant with a fetus at risk for hemolytic disease seems to have a potential clinically relevant , beneficial effect on the course and severity of the disease. Confirmation in a multicenter randomized trial is needed.
