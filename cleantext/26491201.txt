  The small intestinal tuft cell-ILC2 circuit mediates epithelial responses to intestinal helminths and protists by tuft cell chemosensory-like sensing and IL-25-mediated activation of lamina propria ILC2s. Small intestine ILC2s constitutively express the IL-25 receptor , which is negatively regulated by A20 ( Tnfaip3). A20 deficiency in ILC2s spontaneously triggers the circuit and , unexpectedly , promotes adaptive small-intestinal lengthening and remodeling. Circuit activation occurs upon weaning and is enabled by dietary polysaccharides that render mice permissive for Tritrichomonas colonization , resulting in luminal accumulation of acetate and succinate , metabolites of the protist hydrogenosome. Tuft cells express GPR91 , the succinate receptor , and dietary succinate , but not acetate , activates ILC2s via a tuft- , TRPM5- , and IL-25-dependent pathway. Also induced by parasitic helminths , circuit activation and small intestinal remodeling impairs infestation by new helminths , consistent with the phenomenon of concomitant immunity. We describe a metabolic sensing circuit that may have evolved to facilitate mutualistic responses to luminal pathosymbionts.
