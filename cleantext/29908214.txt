  Estrogen replacement therapy ( ERT) improves hippocampus-dependent cognition. This study investigated the impact of estrogen on hippocampal volume , CA1 subfield volume and myelinated fibers in the CA1 subfield of middle-aged ovariectomized rats. Ten-month-old bilaterally ovariectomized ( OVX) female rats were randomly divided into OVX + E2 and OVX + Veh groups. After four weeks of subcutaneous injection with 17β-estradiol or a placebo , the OVX + E2 rats exhibited significantly short mean escape latency in a spatial learning task than that in the OVX + Veh rats. Using stereological methods , we did not observe significant differences in the volumes of the hippocampus and CA1 subfields between the two groups. However , using stereological methods and electron microscopy techniques , the total length of myelinated fibers and the total volumes of myelinated fibers , myelin sheaths and myelinated axons in the CA1 subfields of OVX + E2 rats were significantly 38.1 % , 34.2 % , 36.1 % and 32.5 % , respectively , higher than those in the OVX + Veh rats. After the parameters were calculated according to different diameter ranges , the estrogen replacement-induced remodeling of myelinated fibers in CA1 was mainly manifested in the myelinated fibers with a diameter of < 1.0 μm. Therefore , four weeks of continuous E2 replacement improved the spatial learning capabilities of middle-aged ovariectomized rats. The E2 replacement-induced protection of spatial learning abilities might be associated with the beneficial effects of estrogen on myelinated fibers , particularly those with the diameters less than 1.0 μm , in the hippocampal CA1 region of middle-aged ovariectomized rats.
