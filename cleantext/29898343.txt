  To compare the general quality of life of women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy in a public and a private institution. Longitudinal observational study including 115 women with breast cancer in an outpatient chemotherapy treatment at two health institutions , one public and one private , in the city of Curitiba ( Brazil). The Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 and the Quality of Life Questionnaire- Breast Cancer Module instruments were applied at three moments of treatment ( onset , 40-50 days , and 85-95 days after initiation). Women 's global health status was affected in both groups since the first phase of chemotherapy ( 76.2 points in the private institution and 74.6 points in the public institution , considering 100 points = maximum health). In both groups there was worsening of quality of life over time , which was lower in women in the private institution ( second phase = 75.0 and third phase = 74; p = 0.47) , compared to those in the public institution ( second phase = 71.5 and third phase 69.1; p = 0.02). Regarding the type of institution , the most committed functions were the emotional and social in the private , and physical and pain in the public. The global quality of life of women with breast cancer deteriorated as a result of chemotherapy in both institutions , and it was lower in those receiving private care. Nursing should consider the type of institution responsible for women 's care in order to provide comprehensive care that considers the functions affected at each phase of treatment.
