  The control of structural and chemical transitions in bimetallic nanoalloys at finite temperatures is one of the challenges for their use in advanced applications. Comparing Nested Sampling and Molecular Dynamics simulations , we investigate the phase changes of CuPt nanoalloys with the aim to elucidate the role of kinetic effects during their solidification and melting processes. We find that the quasi-thermodynamic limit for the nucleation of ( CuPt)
