  The chemokine CCL28 is constitutively expressed in mucosal tissues and is abundant in low-salt mucosal secretions. Beyond its traditional role as a chemoattractant , CCL28 has been shown to act as a potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent with particular efficacy against the commensal fungus and opportunistic pathogen Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> However , the structural features that allow CCL28 to perform its chemotactic and antimicrobial functions remain unknown. Here , we report the structure of CCL28 , solved using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. CCL28 adopts the canonical chemokine tertiary fold , but also has a disordered C-terminal domain that is partially tethered to the core by a non-conserved disulfide bond. Structure-function analysis reveals that removal of the C-terminal tail reduces the antifungal activity of CCL28 without disrupting its structural integrity. Conversely , removal of the non-conserved disulfide bond destabilizes the tertiary fold of CCL28 without altering its antifungal effects. Moreover , we report that CCL28 unfolds in response to low pH but is stabilized by the presence of salt. To explore the physiologic relevance of the observed structural lability of CCL28 , we investigated the effects of pH and salt on the antifungal activity of CCL28 in vitro. We found that low pH enhances the antifungal potency of CCL28 , but also that this pH effect is independent of CCL28 's tertiary fold. Given its dual role as a chemoattractant and antimicrobial agent , our results suggest that changes in the salt concentration or pH at mucosal sites may fine-tune CCL28 's functional repertoire by adjusting the thermostability of its structure.
