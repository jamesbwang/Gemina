  Cachexia is a wasting condition associated with late stages of many chronic illnesses and may be present in up to 80 % of patients with advanced cancers. Cachexia is a metabolic derangement resulting in a disturbance to the homeostasis of muscle breakdown and synthesis , favoring catabolism and muscle<symptom> loss<symptom>. Despite making strides in treating cancer itself , there have been no major advances in the treatment of cachexia pharmacologically or nutritionally. Clinical trials using anti-TNF biologics and thalidomide have largely failed. A new approach may be to focus on other possible waste-inducing mediators , possibly derived from mast cells , and the beneficial action of select natural flavonoids.
