  Preeclampsia is one of the most frequent and difficult illnesses in pregnancy , which jeopardizes both mother and fetus. There are several diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia. However , the preeclampsia-associated myocardial damage has not been described. In this study , we employed reduced uterine perfusion pressure ( RUPP) to generate a rat model of preeclampsia for the evaluation of myocardial damage in late-gestation rats. The expressions of cardiac injury markers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. The arterial pressure and myocardial tissue velocities were also measured. The role of interleukin ( IL) -6 in RUPP-associated myocardial damage was further explored. The results showed that RUPP rats had significant myocardial damage , as demonstrated by the high expressions of myoglobin , creatine kinase isoenzyme , cardiac troponin I , and brain natriuretic peptide. In addition , RUPP increased the mean arterial pressure and the early transmitral flow velocity to mitral annulus early diastolic velocity ratio ( E/Ea). Furthermore , IL-6 deteriorated these abnormalities , whereas inhibition of IL-6 significantly relieved them. In conclusion , our study demonstrated that RUPP rats displayed myocardial damage in an IL-6-dependent manner.
