  The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA or we) is classifying the non-absorbable , hemostatic gauze for temporary internal use into class II ( special controls). The special controls that apply to the device type are identified in this order and will be part of the codified language for the non-absorbable , hemostatic gauze for temporary internal use 's classification. We are taking this action because we have determined that classifying the device into class II ( special controls) will provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device. We believe this action will also enhance patients ' access to beneficial innovative devices , in part by reducing regulatory burdens.
