  To assess the changes in the maxillary buccal alveolar bone during alignment without extractions. Secondarily , to evaluate the changes in arch dimensions and buccolingual inclinations of teeth and to identify risk factors for bone loss. Twenty-two adolescents with crowded permanent dentitions were treated without extractions with Damon 3MX brackets. Cone beam computed tomographic scans were taken before treatment ( T0) and after alignment ( T1). Bone thickness ( BT) and height from the cementoenamel junction to the alveolar crest ( BH) were evaluated at the maxillary central incisors , second premolars , and buccal roots of first molars. Changes in all variables from T0 to T1 were assessed. Correlations between bone changes and initial bone thickness , initial arch widths , initial crowding , amount of expansion , amount of tipping , and amount of molar rotation were calculated. BT decreased and BH increased significantly for the incisors and mesiobuccal root of the first molars. Arch dimensions generally increased together with tipping. Bone loss was correlated with crowding and amount of expansion in the premolar region. Initially thinner BT was correlated with greater apical migration of bone for the incisors. Nonextraction alignment with self-ligating brackets led to arch expansion associated with tipping of teeth. Expansion related to alignment resulted in horizontal and vertical bone loss at the incisors and mesiobuccal root of the first molars. Thinner BTs and more severe crowding before treatment increased the risk for buccal bone loss.
