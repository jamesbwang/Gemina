  To investigate the role of Twist in regulating the proliferation , migration , and invasion of osteosarcoma cells with different levels of malignancy. The baseline expressions of Twist in 3 different osteosarcoma cell lines ( 143B , MG63 and TE85) were detected using real-time PCR and Western blotting. The cells were infected with the recombinant adenoviruses Ad-Twist or Ad-siTwist for Twist overexpression or knockdown , respectively , and the cell growth curves were drawn to assess the cell proliferation. The migration abilities and invasiveness of the cells were evaluated using wound<disease> healing assay and Transwell assay. Luc-labeled 143B cells infected with Ad-Twist or Ad-siTwist were intrathecally injected to establish nude mouse models bearing osteosarcoma xenografts , in which the tumor formation was monitored using living body imaging technique. The baseline expressions of Twist in the 3 osteosarcoma cells were significantly higher than that in C3H10 cells ( P < 0.05). Twist expression was the highest in 143B cells followed by MG63 cells , and was the lowest in TE85 cells , indicating its positive correlation with the level of malignancy of the osteosarcoma cells. Ad-Twist or Ad-siTwist infection efficiently enhanced or lowered Twist expressions at both mRNA and protein levels in osteosarcoma cells ( P < 0.05). Twist overexpression resulted in enhanced proliferation , migration and invasion abilities of osteosarcoma cells , and Twist knockdown obviously inhibited the cell proliferation , migration and invasion. In nude mice , 143B cells with Twist overexpression showed accelerated tumor formation compared with the control cells , while Twist knockdown significantly inhibited the tumor formation ability of the cells. Twist overexpression can promote the proliferation , migration , invasion and tumorigenicity of osteosarcoma cells.
