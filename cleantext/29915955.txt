  Although there is literature suggesting that pathophysiologic changes in children with congenital heart disease alter the pharmacokinetics of anesthetics and may result in dosage adjustment , limited information exists regarding the pharmacokinetics of remifentanil in infants with unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot ( TOF). The objectives of the current analysis were to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of remifentanil in infants , and to evaluate the effects of TOF on remifentanil 's pharmacokinetics. Twenty-seven infants ( 16 with TOF and 11 with normal cardiac anatomy; aged 114-360 days) scheduled to undergo elective surgery under general anesthesia were recruited in the study. All children received remifentanil 1 Î¼g/kg/min intravenously for anesthesia induction and early maintenance ( until ~ 20 min before cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB) for patients with TOF). Serial arterial blood samples were drawn and analyzed. Population pharmacokinetics of remifentanil was characterized using NONMEM software. The estimates were standardized to a 70-kg adult using a per-kilogram model. A two-compartment disposition model adequately described the pharmacokinetics of remifentanil. Besides body<symptom> weight , the introduction of any other covariates , including TOF status , did not improve the model significantly ( P > 0.05). The population parameter estimates for systemic clearance ( Cl Unrepaired TOF does not change the pharmacokinetics of remifentanil , suggesting a similar dosage for infants with TOF compared to normal cardiac anatomy infants. The patient enrollment in this study started at 2012 , so we do not have clinic trial number , but we still think this is a valuable research and hope it could be considered for publication.
