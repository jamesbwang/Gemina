  Ultrafast time-resolved X-ray scattering , made possible by free-electron laser sources , provides a wealth of information about electronic and nuclear dynamical processes in molecules. The technique provides stroboscopic snapshots of the time-dependent electronic charge density traditionally used in structure determination and reflects the interplay of elastic and inelastic processes , nonadiabatic dynamics , and electronic populations and coherences. The various contributions to ultrafast off-resonant diffraction from populations and coherences of molecules in crystals , in the gas phase , or from single molecules are surveyed for core-resonant and off-resonant diffraction. Single-molecule ( Formula: see text) scaling and two-molecule ( Formula: see text) scaling contributions , where N is the number of active molecules , are compared. Simulations are presented for the excited-state nonadiabatic dynamics of the electron harpooning at the avoided crossing in NaF. We show how a class of multiple diffraction signals from a single molecule can reveal charge-density fluctuations through multidimensional correlation functions of the charge density.
