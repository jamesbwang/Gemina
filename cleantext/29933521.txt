  The purposes of this study were three-fold: ( i) to determine the contribution of known genes to the causation of a broad-spectrum of pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy ( DRE) , ( ii) to compare the diagnostic yield and cost among different next-generation sequencing ( NGS) approaches , and especially ( iii) to assess how NGS approaches can benefit patients by improving diagnosis and treatment efficiency. This study enrolled 273 pediatric DRE patients with no obvious acquired etiology. Seventy-four patients underwent whole-exome sequencing ( WES) , 141 patients had epilepsy-related gene panel testing , and another 58 patients had clinical WES gene panel testing. We obtained these patients ' seizure<symptom> and hospitalization frequency by periodic follow-up phone calls and outpatient visits. Genetic diagnosis was achieved in 86 patients ( 31.5 %) and involved 93 likely disease-causing mutations in 33 genes. In this study , the detection rates of the epilepsy-related gene panel , the clinical WES gene panel , and WES were 32.6 % ( 46/141) , 44.8 % ( 26/58) , and 17.3 % ( 13/74) , respectively. Moreover , 34 patients accepted corrective therapy according to their mutant genes , after which 52.9 % ( 18/34) became seizure-free and 38.2 % ( 13/34) achieved seizure<symptom> reduction. In the end , patients with either positive or negative genetic results had significantly fewer hospitalization incidents ( times/half year) than before ( positive genetic results group 0.58 ± 1.14 vs 0.10 ± 0.26; negative genetic results group 0.72 ± 1.65 vs 0.12 ± 0.33). These results offer further proof that NGS approaches represent powerful tools for establishing a definitive diagnosis. Moreover , this study indicated how NGS can improve treatment efficacy and reduce hospitalization in children with DRE.
