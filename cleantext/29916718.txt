  Well-defined noble metal nanomaterials are attractive as catalysts for various applications because of abundant surface-active sites. However , the shape-controlled synthesis of high-performance Pt-based nanocatalysts remains a forbidden challenge. We herein demonstrate a versatile approach for realizing the systemically controlled syntheses of bimetallic Pt-Cu nanocrystals ( NCs) from concave nanocubes ( CNCs) , to excavated nanocubes , to tripods via simply switching the amount of glycine ( reducing agent). These Pt-Cu nanostructures supply a desirable platform for carrying out the structure-dependent electrocatalytic studies in the liquid fuel electro-oxidation. Impressively , all of the Pt-Cu NCs show high activity and outstanding durability for alcohol oxidation. In particular , the Pt-Cu CNCs display unprecedent high activity toward MOR and EOR , which are found to be 2041.1 and 5760.9 mA mg
