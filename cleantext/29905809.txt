  Bertha armyworm Mamestra configurata Walker ( Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a generalist herbivore that feeds on several crops in different plant families. Canola Brassica napus L. ( Capparales: Brassicaceae) is one of the most favored host plants making the bertha armyworm a significant insect pest in the Canadian Prairie Provinces. The performance of the bertha armyworm on canola may vary with the quality of the canola plant. We tested the impact of plant nutrition and canola variety on oviposition and subsequent larval development of the bertha armyworm. A range of fertilization levels ( 0.0 , 1.0 , 3.0 , and 5.0 g/pot) were applied to three different canola varieties: Clearfield 5535 CL , Roundup Ready hybrid 6060RR , and Q2. The total number of eggs laid on plants in a no-choice experiment increased with fertilizer level but a similar number of eggs were laid on plants that received moderate and high fertilizer treatments. Larvae reared on plants that received the moderate fertilizer application yielded heavier pupae than those reared on plants with low and high fertilizer treatments. Most eggs were laid on the Q2 variety when compared to Clearfield 5535 CL and Roundup Ready 6060 RR. Bertha armyworm females preferred to lay eggs on plants that received moderate or high fertilization over plants with the low fertilizer treatment. Plant leaf tissue nutrient content and plant growth were highest in plants that received moderate and high fertilizer treatment. We conclude that bertha armyworm oviposition behavior and larval performance are influenced by fertilizer treatment and canola variety.
