  The effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs) and simvastatin combination therapy on serum total and specific IgE levels and lung IL-13 and TGF-β levels in sensitized mouse were examined. Control ( n = 5) , Sensitized ( S) , ( n = 5) , S + BMSC ( n = 6) , S + simvastatin ( n = 6) and S + BMSC + simvastatin ( n = 4) groups of BALB/c mice were studied. Mice were sensitized by ovalbumin. Sensitized mice were treated with a single intravenous injection of BMSCs ( 1 × 10 Serum total and specific IgE levels as well as lung IL-13 and TGF-β levels were significantly increased in S group compared to control group ( P < 0.001 for all cases). Treatment with BMSCs , simvastatin and their combination significantly decreased serum total and specific IgE levels ( P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). However , IL-13 and TGF-β levels were significantly decreased by BMSCs and BMSC + simvastatin combination therapy ( P < 0.05 for all cases). The effect of simvastatin and BMSCs combination therapy on serum specific IgE levels as well as lung IL-13 and TGF-β levels were significantly higher than the effect of BMSCs and simvastatin alone ( P < 0.001 for IL-13 and P < 0.01 for other cases). Simvastatin and BMSCs combination therapy affects serum IgE as well as lung IL-13 and TGFβ levels more than BMSC therapy and simvastatin therapy alone which may be due to increased BMSCs migration into the lung tissue.
