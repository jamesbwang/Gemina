  Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) is used to select patients for primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( ICDs). The relationship between baseline and long-term follow-up LVEF and clinical outcomes among primary prevention ICD patients remains unclear. We studied 195 patients with a baseline LVEF ≤ 35 % ≤ 6 months prior to ICD implantation and follow-up LVEF 1-3 years after ICD implantation without intervening left ventricular assist device ( LVAD) or transplant. The co-primary study endpoints were: ( 1) a composite of time to death , LVAD , or transplant and ( 2) appropriate ICD therapy. We examined multivariable Cox proportional hazard models with a 3-year post-implant landmark view; the LVEF closest to the 3-year mark was considered the follow-up LVEF for analyses. Follow-up LVEF was examined using 2 definitions: ( 1) ≥ 10 % improvement compared to baseline or ( 2) actual value of ≥ 40 %. Fifty patients ( 26 %) had a LVEF improvement of ≥ 10 % and 44 ( 23 %) had a follow-up LVEF ≥ 40 %. Neither baseline nor follow-up LVEF was significantly associated with the composite endpoint. In contrast , both baseline and follow-up LVEF were associated with risk for long-term ICD therapies , whether follow-up LVEF was modeled as a ≥ 10 % absolute improvement ( baseline LVEF HR 0.87 , CI 0.91-0.93 , P < .001; follow-up LVEF HR 0.18 , CI 0.06-0.53 , P = .002) or a ≥ 40 % follow-up value ( baseline LVEF HR 0.89 , CI 0.83-0.96 , P = .001 , follow-up LVEF HR 0.26 , CI 0.08-0.87 , P = .03). Among primary prevention ICD recipients , both baseline and follow-up LVEF were independently associated with long-term risk for appropriate ICD therapy , but they were not associated with time to the composite of LVAD , transplant , or death.
