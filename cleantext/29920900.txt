  In the present study , we reported on the current breast cancer screening rates among Chinese women in China and examined whether demographic factors and cultural beliefs were associated with their screening behavior. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a convenience sample of 494 Chinese women who completed the modified Breast Cancer Screening Beliefs Questionnaire ( BCSBQ). Two-sample t-tests and multivariable logistic regression were employed to analyze the data. The results indicated that participation in screening practices ranged from 27.5 % for breast self-examination ( BSE) , 36.4 % for clinical breast examination , 23.5 % for mammography , and 40 % for ultrasonography. Women who had previously engaged in one of the four screening practices had significantly higher scores on the three subscales of the modified BCSBQ. Being older and having a friend who had been diagnosed with breast cancer were shown to be predictors for BSE and participation in either mammography or ultrasonography , respectively. Education levels were also shown to be positively associated with the four screening measures. We suggest that cultural beliefs about breast cancer and screening practices play a significant role in Chinese women 's screening behavior.
