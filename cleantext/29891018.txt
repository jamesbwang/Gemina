  To describe a newly observed frontal sinus anatomical variant , the fronto-septal rostrum. Consecutive sinus computed tomography scans performed during 2013 were reviewed. The fronto-septal rostrum was defined as a mucosa-lined air space formed in the attachment of the most upper bony nasal septum and the central floor of the frontal sinuses. The study included 400 computed tomography scans from 189 women ( 47.3 per cent) and 211 men ( 52.8 per cent) , with a mean age of 46.8 years. A fronto-septal rostrum was observed in 122 patients ( 30.5 per cent) , with a mean length of 10.63 mm , width of 4.52 mm , height of 2.18 mm and volume of 63.52 mm3. There was no statistically significant difference related to gender ( p = 0.343) , and no association between the side of the fronto-septal rostrum and age ( p = 0.811) or volume ( p = 0.203). The newly described fronto-septal rostrum has possible clinical and surgical implications. It is suggested that this aerated space is used in specific surgical indications and its presence evaluated in cases of septal infection.
