  Agomelatine is a melatonin ( MT1/MT2) receptor agonist and serotonin ( 5-HT2C) receptor antagonist. To study the effects of agomelatine on myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury ( MIRI) , an isolated rat heart model was utilized. To induce MIRI , rat hearts were isolated and subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with agomelatine ( 10 , 20 or 40 mg/kg) 1 h before heart isolation. Agomelatine ( 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg) significantly improved cardiac function , alleviated pathological changes in the ischemic myocardium , reduced myocardial infarct size and decreased release of creatine kinase-MB and lactate dehydrogenase. Heart tissue from agomelatine-treated rats retained higher NAD
