  Open source technologies and mobile innovations have radically changed the way people interact with technology. These innovations and advancements have been used across various disciplines and already have a significant impact. Microscopy , with focus on visually appealing contrasting colors for better appreciation of morphology , forms the core of the disciplines such as Pathology , microbiology , and anatomy. Here , learning happens with the aid of multi-head microscopes and digital camera systems for teaching larger groups and in organizing interactive sessions for students or faculty of other departments. The cost of the original equipment manufacturer ( OEM) camera systems in bringing this useful technology at all the locations is a limiting factor. To avoid this , we have used the low-cost technologies like Raspberry Pi , Mobile high definition link and 3D printing for adapters to create portable camera systems. Adopting these open source technologies enabled us to convert any binocular or trinocular microscope be connected to a projector or HD television at a fraction of the cost of the OEM camera systems with comparable quality. These systems , in addition to being cost-effective , have also provided the added advantage of portability , thus providing the much-needed flexibility at various teaching locations.
