  In this work , we characterize the impact of large-volume processing upon the analytical sensitivity of flow-through paper-based immunoassays. Larger sample volumes feature greater molar quantities of available analyte , but the assay design principles which would enable the rapid collection of this dilute target are ill-defined. We developed a finite-element model to explore the operating conditions under which processing large sample volumes via pressure-driven convective flow would yield an improved binding signal. Our simulation results underscore the importance of establishing a high local concentration of the analyte-binding species within the porous substrate. This elevated abundance serves to enhance the binding kinetics , matching the time scale of target capture to the period during which the sample is in contact with the test zone ( i.e. , the effective residence time). These findings were experimentally validated using the rcSso7d-cellulose-binding domain ( CBD) fusion construct , a bifunctional binding protein which adsorbs to cellulose in high abundance. As predicted by our modeling efforts , the local concentration achieved using the rcSso7d-CBD species is uniquely enabling for sensitivity enhancement through large-volume processing. The rapid analyte depletion which occurs at this high surface density also permits the processing of large sample volumes within practical time scales and flow regimes. Using these findings , we present guidance for the optimal means of processing large sample volumes for enhanced assay sensitivity.
