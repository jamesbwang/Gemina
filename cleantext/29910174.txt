  Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) leaks are extracranial egress of CSF into the adjacent paranasal sinus or tympanomastoid cavity due to an osteodural defect involving skull base. It can be due to a multitude of causes including accidental or iatrogenic trauma , congenital malformations and spontaneous leaks. Accurate localization of the site of the leak , underlying causes and appropriate therapy is necessary to avoid associated complications. In this paper relevant anatomy , clinical diagnosis , imaging modalities and associated findings are discussed along with a brief mention about management.
