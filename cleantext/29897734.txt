  Solar-blind ultraviolet ( SBUV) detection has important applications in wireless secure communication , early warning , and so forth. However , the desired key device for SBUV detection and high-sensitivity and low-noise `` sandwich '' photodetector with large detective area is difficult to be fabricated because it is usually hard for traditional wide band gap semiconductors to boast both high conductivity and high SBUV transparency. Here , we proposed to use graphene as the transparent conductive layer to form graphene/Î²-Ga
