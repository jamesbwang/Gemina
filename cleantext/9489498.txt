  Muscle shortening and spastic cocontraction in ankle plantar flexors<symptom> may alter gait since early childhood in cerebral palsy ( CP). We evaluated gastrosoleus complex ( GSC) length , and gastrocnemius medialis ( GM) and peroneus longus ( PL) activity during swing phase , in very young hemiparetic children with equinovalgus. This was an observational , retrospective , and monocentric outpatient study in a pediatric hospital. Ten very young hemiparetic children ( age 3 Â± 1 yrs) were enrolled. These CP children were assessed for muscle extensibility ( Tardieu scale On the paretic side: ( i) the mean In very young hemiparetic children , the paretic GSC may rapidly shorten in the first years of life. GM and PL cocontraction during swing phase are excessive , which contributes to dynamic equinovalgus. Muscle extensibility (
