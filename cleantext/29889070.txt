  Three articles have very recently appeared that are of especial relevance to the causes of dementia and its potential treatment. The first two ( Tsai et al. , published in PLoS One in November 2017; Chen et al. , published in the January/February 2018 issue of Journal of Clinical Psychiatry) demonstrate an increased risk of subsequent senile dementia ( SD) development in patients with acute varicella zoster<disease> ( herpes<disease> zoster<disease> infection. These articles present data highly relevant to the third , and most important , paper-by Tzeng et al. , published online in the journal Neurotherapeutics at the end of February 2018. These authors report that infection with a different herpes<disease> virus , herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus type 1 ( HSV1) , leads to a similarly increased risk of later developing SD. Further , when the authors looked at patients treated aggressively with antiherpetic medications at the time , the relative risk of SD was reduced by a factor of 10. It should be stressed that no investigations were made on subjects already suffering from SD , and that those treated were the few rare cases severely affected by HSV. Nonetheless , antiherpetic medication prevented later SD development in 90 % of their study group. These articles provide the first population evidence for a causal link between herpes<disease> virus infection and senile dementia.
