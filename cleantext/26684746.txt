  With the growing popularity of social media , corporate marketers are increasingly launching hashtag campaigns to encourage consumers to create branded user-generated content on their behalves. If successful , these campaigns may expand the reach of harmful marketing messages and capitalize on peer-effects among adolescents. To shed light on these novel corporate campaigns , we performed a case study of the user-generated Instagram content created in response to a hashtag campaign promoting the quick-service restaurant Kentucky Fried Chicken ( KFC). We performed a content analysis of one week 's worth of user-generated Instagram posts created with the hashtag #HowDoYouKFC between 24 April 2015-1 May 2015. Posts were coded to discern: ( a) relevance to KFC as a brand and/or food; ( b) themes in the post , ( c) the content of images/videos , and ( d) overall sentiment toward KFC. Posts that were deleted or made private during the study period were removed. Descriptive statistics were calculated to discern trends in post content. Instagram users created 196 posts with #HowDoYouKFC during the study period. After removing irrelevant and deleted/private posts , analysis of the 128 remaining user-generated posts revealed that 45 % of posts were explicitly positive toward KFC and 39 % lacked a specific stance or emotion related to KFC. Of the posts , 55 % depicted KFC chicken and 65 % included depictions of the brand hashtag on food packaging. Findings indicate that corporations are successfully converting individual social media users into positive advertisers for harmful products. Novel efforts are needed to counter corporate user-generated content campaigns.
