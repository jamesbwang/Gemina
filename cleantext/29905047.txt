  To analyze the treatment of Gartland type Ⅱ and Ⅲ supracondylar fracture of the humerus in children. Between January 2015 and January 2017 , 45 cases of Gartland type Ⅱ and Ⅲ supracondylar fracture of the humerus were treated. There were 28 boys and 17 girls with an age of 1-13 years ( mean , 5.7 years). The causes of injury included sports injury in 43 cases and falling from height in 2 cases. Fractures were classified as type Ⅱ in 12 cases and type Ⅲ in 33 cases according to Gartland classification. The time from injury to operation was 2-12 hours ( mean , 4.6 hours). All fractures were treated with closed reduction first , and 12 cases of Gartland type Ⅱ fracture were successful in closed reduction; 20 cases of Gartland type Ⅲ fracture were successful in closed reduction , 11 cases with reduction failure and 2 cases with radial nerve injury underwent assisted anterior transverse approach reduction. Then percutaneous crossed Kirschner wires fixation was performed. The operation time was 16-52 minutes ( mean , 32 minutes). The perspective frequency was 4-17 times ( mean , 6.7 times). The hospitalization time was 3-7 days ( mean , 4 days). All the 45 cases were followed up 8-20 months ( mean , 12 months). The ulnar nerve<symptom> paralysis<symptom> occurred in 3 cases of Gartland type Ⅲ fracture that were treated with closed reduction , and recovered after 1-3 months. All fractures healed after operation , and the healing time was 2-3 months. No incision infection , Volkmann muscle contracture , and other complications occurred. The elbow joint function score at 6 months after operation showed that the results of closed reduction was excellent in 16 cases , good in 12 cases , and fair in 4 cases , with the excellent and good rate of 87.5 %; in which Gartland type Ⅱ fracture was excellent in 9 cases and good in 3 cases , with an excellent and good rate of 100 % , and Gartland Ⅲ was excellent in 7 cases , good in 9 cases , and fair in 4 cases with an excellent and good rate of 80 %. The results of assisted anterior transverse approach reduction was excellent in 7 cases , good in 5 cases , and fair in 1 case , and the excellent and good rate was 92.3 %. Gartland type Ⅱ and Ⅲ supracondylar fractures of the humerus can be treated with closed reduction or combined with the assisted anterior transverse approach reduction , then fixed by percutaneous crossed Kirschner wire , which is operational , smaller invasive , and less radiation exposure during operation , while postoperative function is good.
