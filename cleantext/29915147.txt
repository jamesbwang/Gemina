  Mycolactone is a bacteria-derived macrolide that blocks the biogenesis of a large array of secretory and integral transmembrane proteins ( TMP) through potent inhibition of the Sec61 translocon. Here , we used quantitative proteomics to delineate the direct and indirect effects of mycolactone-mediated Sec61 blockade in living cells. In T lymphocytes , dendritic cells and sensory neurons , Sec61 substrates downregulated by mycolactone were in order of incidence: secretory proteins ( with a signal peptide but no transmembrane domain) , TMPs with a signal peptide ( Type I) and TMPs without signal peptide and a cytosolic N-terminus ( Type II). TMPs without a signal peptide and the opposite N-terminus topology ( Type III) were refractory to mycolactone inhibition. This rule applied comparably to single- and multi-pass TMPs , and extended to exogenous viral proteins. Parallel to its broad-spectrum inhibition of Sec61-mediated protein translocation , mycolactone rapidly induced cytosolic chaperones Hsp70/Hsp90. Moreover , it activated an atypical endoplasmic reticulum stress response , differing from conventional unfolded protein response by the downregulation of Bip. In addition to refining our mechanistic understanding of Sec61 inhibition by mycolactone , our findings thus reveal that Sec61 blockade induces proteostatic stress in the cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum.
