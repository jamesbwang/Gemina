  Ultrasound assisted vacuum thawing ( UVT) or microwave vacuum thawing ( MVT) with red seabream fillets were compared to fresh , chill<symptom> storage thawing , vacuum thawing , microwave thawing and ultrasound thawing. The thermal stability and gelation properties were studied with DSC and dynamic rheology , respectively. Raman spectra before and after H/D isotope exchange and intrinsic fluorescence were used to measure protein secondary and tertiary structure. Low-field NMR was done to measure water migration. The two thawing techniques both retained actin thermal stability and generally retained more stable tertiary structures than the other thawing methods. MVT showed a desirable viscoelasticity of muscle proteins and UVT had a relatively stable secondary structure. There were no significant changes in free water. Thus , UVT and MVT could be used to improve the physicochemical properties of proteins during thawing of fillets.
