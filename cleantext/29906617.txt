  Psychosocial risk factors may predispose to progression of back and neck<symptom> pain<symptom> to chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> or disability. Resilience ( the ability to recover from stress) and pain self-efficacy ( confidence that one can perform daily activities despite pain) are important psychometric properties shown to affect health and illness. To examine the relationships among resilience , pain self-efficacy , and disability in spine patients. Prospective , single-center orthopedic spine clinic. 195 patients in a tertiary spine practice recruited between December 2016 and March 2017. Self-reported measures: Brief Resilience Scale ( BRS) , Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire Short-Form ( PSEQ-2) , Neck Disability Index ( NDI) , Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI). A prospective study was conducted of new patients visiting an orthopaedic spine clinic complaining of neck<symptom> pain<symptom> or low back pain , with or without radiculopathy. Enrolled patients completed a survey of demographic information , the 6-question Brief Resilience Scale ( BRS) , the 2-question Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire Short Form ( PSEQ-2) , and Neck Disability Index ( NDI) or Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI) for neck or back pain , respectively. The relationship between BRS and NDI or ODI was examined , and the relationship between PSEQ-2 and NDI or ODI was also examined. A total of 195 patients were evaluated. After excluding those with incomplete NDI or ODI , 180 patients were included in the analysis ( 46.1 % male ( 83/180); mean age 53 ( SD: 17) years). 139 ( 77.2 %) subjects complained of low back pain and 41 ( 22.8 %) subjects complained of neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. BRS was strongly negatively correlated with NDI ( r = -0.61 , p < 0.0001) and moderately negatively correlated with ODI ( r = -0.34 , p < 0.0001). PSEQ-2 was strongly negatively correlated with NDI ( r = -0.69 , p < 0.0001) and strongly negatively correlated with ODI ( r = -0.62 , p < 0.0001). BRS was moderately positively correlated with PSEQ-2 ( r = 0.36 , p < 0.0001). For the low<symptom> back<symptom> pain<symptom> cohort , the correlation between PSEQ-2 and ODI was significantly greater than the correlation between BRS and ODI ( p = 0.0003); this difference was not noted in the neck<symptom> pain<symptom> cohort ( p = 0.34). Low resilience and low<symptom> pain<symptom> self-efficacy are both independently associated with greater functional disability in neck and low back pain patients. Spine surgeons may find it useful to incorporate the BRS and PSEQ-2 into preoperative assessment. Future studies should examine the utility of these simple validated questionnaires in predicting response to treatments , including surgical intervention.
