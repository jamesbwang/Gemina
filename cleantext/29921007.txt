  Organic photovoltaics are an important part of a next-generation energy-harvesting technology that uses a practically infinite pollutant-free energy source. They have the advantages of light weight , solution processability , cheap materials , low<symptom> production<symptom> cost , and deformability. However , to date , the moderate photovoltaic efficiencies and poor stabilities of organic photovoltaics impede their use as replacements for inorganic photovoltaics. Recent developments in bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaics mean that they have almost reached the lower efficiency limit for feasible commercialization. In this review article , the recent understanding of the ideal bulk-heterojunction morphology of the photoactive layer for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport is described , and recent attempts as well as early-stage trials to realize this ideal morphology are discussed systematically from a morphological viewpoint. The various approaches to optimizing morphologies consisting of an interpenetrating bicontinuous network with appropriate domain sizes and mixed regions are categorized , and in each category , the recent trends in the morphology control on the multilength scale are highlighted and discussed in detail. This review article concludes by identifying the remaining challenges for the control of active layer morphologies and by providing perspectives toward real application and commercialization of organic photovoltaics.
