  As lithium-ion batteries find use in high energy and power applications , such as in electric and hybrid-electric vehicles , monitoring the degradation and subsequent safety issues becomes increasingly important. In a Li-ion cell setup , the voltage measurement across the positive and negative terminals inherently includes the effect of the cathode and anode which are coupled and sum to the total cell performance. Accordingly , the ability to monitor the degradation aspects associated with a specific electrode is extremely difficult because the electrodes are fundamentally coupled. A three-electrode setup can overcome this problem. By introducing a third ( reference) electrode , the influence of each electrode can be decoupled , and the electrochemical properties can be measured independently. The reference electrode ( RE) must have a stable potential that can then be calibrated against a known reference , for example , lithium metal. The three-electrode cell can be used to run electrochemical tests such as cycling , cyclic voltammetry , and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS). Three-electrode cell EIS measurements can elucidate the contribution of individual electrode impedance to the full cell. In addition , monitoring the anode potential allows the detection of electrodeposition due to lithium plating , which can cause safety concerns. This is especially important for the fast charging of Li-ion batteries in electric vehicles. In order to monitor and characterize the safety and degradation aspects of an electrochemical cell , a three-electrode setup can prove invaluable. This paper aims to provide a guide to constructing a three-electrode coin cell setup using the 2032-coin cell architecture , which is easy to produce , reliable , and cost-effective.
