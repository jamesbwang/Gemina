  Retrograde pedal access is a technique utilized with increasing frequency by many interventionists to address patients with advanced multilevel peripheral artery disease and significant comorbidities. This approach to revascularization is being used both in patients who fail traditional antegrade access and in some patients thought to be poor candidates for antegrade approach. However , the lack of randomized controlled trial data , or long-term results , coupled with the associated potential risks including dissection , spasm , and thrombosis have rendered retrograde pedal access a controversial topic. This article details the pros and cons associated with the debate surrounding retrograde pedal access and highlights the current literature and remaining questions regarding outcomes of this technique.
