  Risk perception has been found to be a crucial factor explaining inconsistent or non-use of HIV<pathogen> prevention interventions. Considerations of risk need to expand beyond risk of infection to also include the personal , social , emotional , and economic risks associated with prevention intervention use. This systematic review of qualitative peer-reviewed literature from sub-Saharan Africa examines perceptions of risk associated with HIV<pathogen> infection and HIV<pathogen> prevention intervention use. We searched Medline , Embase , PsychInfo , Africa Wide Info , CINAHL , and Global Health for publications and screened them for relevance. Peer-reviewed qualitative studies published since 2003 were eligible for inclusion if they examined risk perception or uncertainty in the context of a medically regulated intervention. Only studies focusing on adults were included. Included publications were quality assessed using the Hawker method and coded thematically. 10318 unique papers were identified , of which 29 are included. Among the themes identified , a particularly salient one was the potential of HIV<pathogen> prevention interventions to threaten the stability of a relationship and impact on how and when people may-or may not-choose to use prevention interventions. This literature review excludes grey-literature , which may have distinct valuable insights. We also excluded quantitative studies that may have challenged or triangulated our findings. When considering the risk of HIV<pathogen> acquisition , it is insufficient to examine biological risk in isolation from the personal , relational and economic costs associated with intervention use. This loss of emotional , physical , or material support may be perceived as more consequential than the prevention of a potential infection.
