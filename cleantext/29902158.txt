  Laurus nobilis leaves contain flavored and bioactive components with relevant biological properties for human health that are attributed to an abundant presence of highly bioactive secondary metabolites. However , the separation process for these bioactive molecules from plant matrix is seriously limited by the presence of a physical barrier ( cell wall). Thus , the use of novel extraction procedures to enhance their release is particularly important. In this work , the potential use of microwave-assisted extraction ( MAE) as a tool to improve the extraction efficiency of bioactive compounds from bay leaves and their characterization was evaluated. The effects of irradiation time ( 3 , 6 and 9 min) and aqueous ethanol concentration ( 0 , 25 and 50 %) on the extraction of phenolic compounds were evaluated. A response surface methodology was applied to determine the best extraction conditions by MAE. The maximum total phenolic compound under the best conditions ( 9 min time irradiation and aqueous ethanol 50 %) was 10.63 Â± 0.91 mg gallic acid equivalent/g plant using MAE. Also , the antioxidant potential of the extracts obtained was evaluated.
