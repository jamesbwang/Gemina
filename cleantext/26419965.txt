  Endpoints that are commonly used in trials of moderate/severe stroke may be less frequent in patients with minor , non-disabling stroke thus inflating sample sizes. We tested whether trial efficiency might be improved with composite endpoints. We prospectively recruited patients with lacunar and minor non-lacunar ischaemic stroke ( NIHSS ≤ 7) and assessed recurrent vascular events ( stroke , transient ischaemic attack ( TIA) , ischemic heart disease ( IHD)) , modified Rankin Score ( mRS) and cognitive testing with the Addenbrooke 's Cognitive Examination ( ACE-R) one year post-stroke. For a potential secondary prevention randomised controlled trial ( RCT) , we estimated sample sizes using individual or combined outcomes , at power 80 % ( and 90 %) , alpha 5 % , required to detect a relative 10 % risk reduction. Amongst 264 patients ( 118 lacunar , 146 non-lacunar) , at one year , 30/264 ( 11 %) patients had a recurrent vascular event , 5 ( 2 %) had died , 3 ( 1 %) had clinically-diagnosed dementia , 53/264 ( 20 %) had mRS ≥ 3 and 29/158 ( 19 %) had ACE-R ≤ 82 ( 57 could not attend for cognitive testing). For a potential trial , at 80 % power , using mRS ≥ 3 alone would require Composite outcomes including vascular events , dependency , and cognition reduce sample size and increase efficiency , feasibility , and relevance to patients of RCTs in minor ischaemic stroke. Efficiency might be improved further with more practical cognitive test strategies.
