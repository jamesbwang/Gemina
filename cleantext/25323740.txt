  To estimate whether the diagnosis of asthma is associated with the use of specific uterotonic and antihypertensive medications during delivery hospitalizations. We used Perspective , an administrative database , to determine whether women hospitalized for delivery complicated by postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> or preeclampsia received uterotonics and antihypertensive medications differentially based on the absence or presence of asthma from 2006 to 2015. Given that carboprost and intravenous ( IV) labetalol may be associated with asthma exacerbation , adjusted models for receipt of these medications were created with adjusted risk ratios with 95 % CIs as measures of effect. Risk for status asthmaticus based on receipt of carboprost and IV labetalol was analyzed. Over the study period , a total of 5,691,178 women were analyzed , of whom 239,915 ( 4.2 %) had preeclampsia and 139,841 postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> ( 2.5 %). Carboprost was used less frequently in patients with asthma compared with patients with no asthma ( 11.4 % vs 18.0 %) in comparison with IV labetalol , which was used more commonly when a diagnosis of asthma was present ( 18.5 % vs 16.7 %). In unadjusted analysis , the presence of asthma was associated with a 37 % decrease in likelihood of carboprost use and an 11 % increase in likelihood of labetalol use. In adjusted analysis , the presence of asthma was associated with a 32 % decrease in likelihood of carboprost use ( adjusted risk ratio 0.68 , 95 % CI 0.62-0.74) compared with a 7 % decrease in labetalol use ( adjusted risk ratio 0.93 , 95 % CI 0.90-0.97). Risk for status asthmaticus was significantly increased with use of IV labetalol compared with other antihypertensive medications ( 6.5 vs 1.7/ 1,000 delivery hospitalizations , P < .01). There may be an opportunity to reduce use of Î²-blockers and carboprost among patients with asthma. Given their association with status asthmaticus , these drugs should be used cautiously in women with asthma.
