  Pesticide is an important agriculture necessity to control plant diseases and pests , ensuring safe production of food. However , the low efficacy , large dosage and high-frequency use of conventional pesticide formulation seriously induced food safety and ecological environment issues. In this research , lambda- cyhalothrin solid nanodispersion ( LCSND) was developed by self-dispersing method. The mean particle size of the lambda-cyhalothrin solid nanodispersion was 32.7 Â± 1.1 nm. It exhibited excellent dispersibility , wettability and stability , especially the improved bioavailability compared to the commercial formulations. Notably , the solid nanodisperison had a small particle size and large specific surface area. The solid nanodispersion without organic solvents can minimize the environment pollution and overcome the instability characteristic of the liquid formulations. Therefore , lambda-cyhalothrin solid nanodispersion has broad application prospects in agricultural production and environmental protection. This article is protected by copyright.
