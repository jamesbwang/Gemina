  Analysed in the article are the results of a comprehensive approach to treatment of patients presenting with lower limb critical ischaemia and diabetes mellitus by means of gene-induced angiogenesis. The study comprised a total of 65 patients found to have an ill-suited for surgical reconstruction peripheral arterial bed and undergoing conservative therapy. The patients were divided into two groups. The Study Group patients additionally to the conventional conservative therapy received 2 intramuscular injections of therapeutic agent Neovasculgen at a course dose of 2.4 mg. The active period of follow up amounted to 6 months followed by evaluating limb salvage and lethal outcomes at a further 6 months thereafter. Efficacy of treatment was determined both by primary criteria ( lethality rate , amputations , dynamics of necrosis<symptom> healing , clinical relief of critical ischaemia) and secondary criteria ( pain-free walking distance , ankle-brachial index , transcutaneous oxygen tension , linear velocity of blood flow , the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument ( MNSI) and Neurological<symptom> Symptom<symptom> Score ( NSS) scale). After 6 months of follow up , the statistical significance in the intragroup and intergroup comparisons was reached for the pain-free walking distance ( increment up to 72.9 Â± 9.2 m , p = 0.032) , transcutaneous oxygen tension ( increment by 34.4 % , p = 0.028) , linear velocity of blood flow ( increment by 65.3 % , p = 0.047). Induction of angiogenesis also made it possible to statistically significantly decrease the manifestations of diabetic neuropathy , as was evidenced by the data of the MSNI ( p = 0.009) and the NSS scale ( p = 0.044). The findings of the study also demonstrated the best value of the limb salvage rate ( p = 0.049) and a lower number of lethal complications at 1 year of follow up.
