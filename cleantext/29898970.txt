  To investigate the role of alcohol as a causal factor for intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH) and whether its effects might vary according to the pathogenic mechanisms underlying cerebral bleeding. We performed a case-control analysis , comparing a cohort of consecutive white patients with ICH aged 55 years and older with a group of age- and sex-matched stroke-free controls , enrolled in the setting of the Multicenter Study on Cerebral Haemorrhage in Italy ( MUCH-Italy) between 2002 and 2014. Participants were dichotomized into excessive drinkers ( > 45 g of alcohol) and light to moderate drinkers or nondrinkers. To isolate the unconfounded effect of alcohol on ICH , we used causal directed acyclic graphs and the back-door criterion to select a minimal sufficient adjustment set ( s) of variables for multivariable analyses. Analyses were performed on the whole group as well as separately for lobar and deep ICH. We analyzed 3,173 patients ( 1,471 lobar ICH and 1,702 deep ICH) and 3,155 controls. After adjusting for the preselected variables in the minimal sufficient adjustments , heavy alcohol intake was associated with deep ICH risk ( odds ratio ( OR) , 1.68; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.36-2.09) as well as with the overall risk of ICH ( OR , 1.38; 95 % CI , 1.17-1.63) , whereas no effect was found for lobar ICH ( OR , 1.01; 95 % CI , 0.77-1.32). In white people aged 55 years and older , high alcohol intake might exert a causal effect on ICH , with a prominent role in the vascular pathologies underlying deep ICH.
