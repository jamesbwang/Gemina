  This in vitro study evaluated the fatigue<symptom> strength of different ceramic materials indicated for monolithic restorations. Disc-shaped specimens were made according to ISO 6872 from five different ceramic materials: feldspathic ceramic ( FC) , polymer-infiltrated ceramic network ( PIC) , lithium disilicate glass-ceramic ( LD) , zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic ( ZLS) , and high translucent tetragonal zirconia polycrystals doped by yttrium ( YZ-HT). After obtaining the mean of each material ( n = 5) from monotonic load-to-failure tests , specimens ( n = 20) were subjected to fatigue<symptom> tests ( staircase method) using a biaxial flexural setup ( piston-on-three-balls) , to determine the fatigue<symptom> strength. The parameters used for fatigue<symptom> tests were: 100,000 cycles at 10 Hz , initial load of ~ 60 % of mean load-to-failure , and step size of 5 % of the initial load ( specific for each ceramic material). Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni 's test ( α = 0.05) were used to analyze the fatigue<symptom> strength data. Fatigue<symptom> strength ( MPa) of the materials was statistically different among each other as follows: YZ-HT ( 370.2 ± 38.7) > LD ( 175.2 ± 7.5) > ZLS ( 152.1 ± 7.5) > PIC ( 81.8 ± 3.9) > FC ( 50.8 ± 1.9). Thus , it can be concluded that , in terms of fatigue<symptom> , high translucent polycrystalline zirconia is the best choice for monolithic restorations as it bears the highest load before cracking/fracturing.
