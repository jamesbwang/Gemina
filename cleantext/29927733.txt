  The physiological relevance of slow-wave vasomotion is still unclear , even it has been hypothesized it could be a compensatory mechanism enhancing tissue oxygenation in conditions of reduced oxygen supply. Aim of our study was to explore the effects of hypoxia and ischemia on slow-wave vasomotion in microcirculation. Peripheral oxygen saturation and forearm microcirculation flow ( laser-Doppler flowmetry) were recorded at baseline and during post-occlusive reactive hyperemia<symptom> in the Himalaya region from 8 European lowlanders ( 6 males; aged 29-39yrs) at 1350 , 3400 and 5050m , and from 10 Nepalese male highlanders ( aged 21-39yrs) at 3400 and 5050m of altitude. The same measurements were also performed at sea level in 16 healthy volunteers ( aged 23-61yrs) during a short-term exposure to normobaric hypoxia. In lowlanders , exposure to progressively higher altitude under baseline flow conditions progressively increased 0.06-0.15 Hz vasomotion amplitude ( power spectral density % expressed as geometric means ( geometric standard deviation) = 14.0 ( 3.6) at 1350m; 87.0 ( 2.3) at 3400m and 249.8 ( 3.6) at 5050m , p = 0.006 and p < 0.001 vs 1350m , respectively). In highlanders , low frequency vasomotion amplitude was similarly enhanced at different altitudes ( power spectral density % = 183.4 ( 4.1) at 3400m vs 236.0 ( 3.0) at 5050m , p = 0.139). In both groups at altitude it was further increased after ischemic stimulus ( p < 0.001). At baseline , acute short lasting normobaric hypoxia did not induce low frequency vasomotion , which was conversely induced by ischemia even under normal oxygenation and barometric pressure. This study offers the demonstration of a significant increase in slow-wave vasomotion under prolonged hypobaric-hypoxia exposure at high altitude , with a further enhancement after ischemia induction.
