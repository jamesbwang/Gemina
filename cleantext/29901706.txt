  The function of uropygial glands ( preen glands) has been subject to controversial debates. In this study , we evaluated the antimicrobial potential of preen gland secretions of turkeys ( Meleagris gallopavo) against 18 microbial strains by means of diffusion tests , broth microdilutions , checkerboard assays and time-kill curves. Furthermore , we tested the hypothesis that lipids exert direct antimicrobial effects on pathogens. Moreover , we checked for mutualistic relationships between the preen gland bacterium<pathogen> Corynebacterium<pathogen> uropygiale with its hosts. We found that preen gland secretions significantly inhibited the growth of a broad spectrum of bacteria and fungi<pathogen> , particularly when combined with keratinase. Combinations effectively killed multidrug resistant microorganisms in a strongly synergistic manner. Since feather-degrading microorganisms ( FDM) express keratinase and thereby disrupt the integrity of the plumage , our data suggests that preen gland secretions of turkeys are specifically activated in the presence of FDM , and specifically eliminate FDM from feathers. However , antimicrobial effects did not originate from lipids , but were mediated by highly polar compounds which might be antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs). Finally , C. uropygiale is apparently not involved in the antimicrobial activity of preen gland secretions of turkeys. In conclusion , our results suggest that turkeys can antagonize FDM by amplifying the antimicrobial properties of their preen gland secretions.
