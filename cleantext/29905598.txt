  This retrospective study evaluates the location of the arteries in the maxillary sinus , particularly in the middle portion , using cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT) scans that can detect the lateral arteries with high reliability. In this retrospective study , 2 experienced independent examiners evaluated 602 sinuses on CBCT scans. No significant correlation was found between the location of arteries and the patient 's age , sex , or dentition. In 92.0 % ( P â‰¤ 0.001) of the sinuses , at least 1 arterial branch was detectable. Based on the CBCT scans , we found that a very high proportion of patients have the maxillary artery in their lateral sinus wall , which is important information for sinus augmentation or sinus surgery.
