  A major development in biomedical research is the recognition that the sex of an individual plays a key role in susceptibility , treatment , and outcomes of most diseases. In this contribution , we present evidence that sex is also important in the toxicity of many environmental toxicants and contributes to the effect of genetics. Thus , individual differences in response to toxicants includes genetic makeup , the environment and sex; in fact , sex differences may be considered a part of genetic constitution. In this review , we present evidence for sex contribution to susceptibility for a number of toxicants.
