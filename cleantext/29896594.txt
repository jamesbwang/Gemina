  In this work , we present a facile preparation of a paper-based glucose assay for rapid , sensitive , and quantitative measurement of glucose in blood plasma and urine. Two copper phosphorescent complexes ( Cu ( 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) ( 2,6-dimethylphenylisocyanide) 2) ( B ( C6H3 ( CF3) 2) 4) ( Cu1) and ( Cu ( 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline) ( 2,6-dimethylphenylisocyanide) 2) ( B ( C6H3 ( CF3) 2) 4) ( Cu2) and a new silver congener ( Ag ( P3) CNAg ( P3)) ( B ( C6H3 ( CF3) 2) 4) ( Ag3) ( P3 = PPh2C6H4-PPh-C6H4PPh2 ( bis ( o-diphenylphosphinophenyl) phenylphosphine)) have been synthesized and their oxygen sensing abilities were investigated. The dimetallic phosphine-based Ag3 complex , having a high oxygen sensing ability , was employed as an efficient signal transducer in enzymatic reactions to recognize blood plasma glucose and urine glucose , which provided a wide linear response for a concentration range between 1.0 and 35 mM and a rapid response , with a limit of detection ( LOD) of 0.09 mM for glucose. In practical application , this Ag3 paper-based device offers great analytical reliability and accuracy upon monitoring glucose concentrations in blood plasma.
