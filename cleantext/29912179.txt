  Stable and efficient red ( R) , green ( G) , and blue ( B) light sources based on solution-processed quantum dots ( QDs) play important roles in next-generation displays and solid-state lighting technologies. The brightness and efficiency of blue QDs-based light-emitting diodes ( LEDs) remain inferior to their red and green counterparts , due to the inherently unfavorable energy levels of different colors of light. To solve these problems , a device structure should be designed to balance the injection holes and electrons into the emissive QD layer. Herein , through a simple autoxidation strategy , pure blue QD-LEDs which are highly bright and efficient are demonstrated , with a structure of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/Poly-TPD/QDs/ Al: Al2O3. The autoxidized Al: Al2O3 cathode can effectively balance the injected charges and enhance radiative recombination without introducing an additional electron transport layer ( ETL). As a result , high color-saturated blue QD-LEDs are achieved with a maximum luminance over 13,000 cd m
