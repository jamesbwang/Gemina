  SETDB1 , an H3K9‑specific histone methyltransferase , has been described as a repressed transcription marker which triggers tumorigenesis of many types of human cancer. However , there are few studies elucidating the relationship between SETDB1 and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In the present study , we confirmed that SETDB1 exhibited higher expression levels in nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC) tissues and cell lines , compared to these levels in non‑tumor tissues and a normal human nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line. Kaplan‑Meier analysis showed that higher SETDB1 expression indicated an unfavorable prognosis for NPC patients , making it an independent prognostic factor for NPC in the COX proportional hazards model. In vitro functional studies revealed that upregulation of SETDB1 expression in CNE1 cells promoted cell proliferation , possibly through cell cycle G1/S phase transition. Moreover , it also enhanced cell migration and invasion ability. Downregulation of SETDB1 expression in 5‑8F cells resulted in the opposite response. Overall , the findings indicated that increased expression of SETDB1 may predict poor overall survival and the malignant phenotype of NPC.
