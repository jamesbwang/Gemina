  Ovarian cancer is one of the most common gynecologic malignancy with poor prognosis. Recently , long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) have been identified as key regulators in cancer development. The current study investigated the role of lncRNA P73 antisense RNA 1T ( TP73-AS1) in ovarian cancer. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction determined the expression levels of TP-73AS1 , matrix metallopeptidases ( MMPs) messenger RNA. Cell proliferative ability , cell invasion , and migration were CCK-8 and colony formation , and transwell invasion and migration assays , respectively. The protein levels of matrix metallopeptidase 2 ( MMP2) and MMP9 were measured by Western blot. TP73-AS1 was upregulated in the ovarian cancer tissues and ovarian cancer cells , and upregulation of TP73-AS1 was associated with poor prognosis. Knockdown of TP73-AS1 significantly suppressed cell proliferation , invasion , and migration of SKOV3 cells , and overexpression of TP73-AS1 promoted cell proliferation , invasion , and migration of OVCA429 cells. In addition , knockdown of TP73-AS1 suppressed the in vivo tumor growth. Tumor metastasis RT
