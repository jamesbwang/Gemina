  Septic<disease> arthritis<disease> of the temporomandibular joint ( TMJ) is rare , but patients with this diagnosis are at high risk for significant morbidity. We present a case of a 15-year-old man who presented with increasing trismus for 3 days. He had only minimal discomfort and swelling of the right cheek and temporal region , and pericoronitis of an impacted wisdom tooth was suspected. Under intravenous antibiotics , pain subsided , but trismus and a slight swelling remained. CT scan showed septic<disease> arthritis<disease> of the TMJ with an abscess<disease> formation penetrating into the epidural space. Immediate drainage and craniotomy were performed. Under intravenous antibiotics , the patient made a full recovery. The source of infection remained undetermined. To our knowledge , this is the first reported case of septic<disease> arthritis<disease> of the TMJ spreading into the epidural space.
