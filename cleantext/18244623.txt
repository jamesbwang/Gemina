  This study aims at analyzing sub-pixel misregistration between multi-spectral images acquired by the Multi-Spectral Instrument ( MSI) aboard Sentinel-2A remote sensing satellite , and exploring its potential for moving target and cloud detection. By virtue of its hardware design , MSI 's detectors exhibit a parallax angle that leads to sub-pixel shifts that are corrected with special pre-processing routines. However , these routines do not correct shifts for moving and/or high altitude objects. In this letter , we apply a phase correlation approach to detect sub-pixel shifts between B2 ( blue) , B3 ( green) and B4 ( red) Sentinel-2A/ MSI images. We show that shifts of more than 1.1 pixels can be observed for moving targets , such as airplanes and clouds , and can be used for cloud detection. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect clouds that are not identified in the built-in cloud mask provided within the Sentinel-2A Level-1C ( L1C) product.
