  Laser-engineered net shaping ( LENS) of coated surfaces can overcome the limitations of conventional coating technologies. We compared the The Morphological assessment of the cells after six hours of incubation using SEM showed that the TPS- and DMF-coated surfaces were largely covered with lamellipodia from the osteoblasts. Cell adhesion appeared similar in both groups. The differences in the rates of cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activities were not statistically significant. The DMF coating applied using metal 3D printing is similar to the TPS coating , which is the most common coating process used for bone ingrowth. The DMF method provided an acceptable surface structure and a viable biological surface. Moreover , this method is automatable and less complex than plasma spraying.
