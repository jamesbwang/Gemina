  Dimethyl fumarate ( DMF) has been registered for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( RRMS). Differences in tolerability between multiple sclerosis clinics in patients treated with DMF has not been examined. We examined real-world tolerability to DMF , and also compared adherence data between two MS clinics. Adverse events ( AE) , discontinuation rates , and causes of discontinuation were investigated. 253 patients participated in this retrospective study. In the total cohort , 27.7 % of the patients discontinued DMF. Higher rate of discontinuation was associated with higher number of previous disease modifying treatments ( p < 0.001). Reasons for discontinuation were primarily flushing ( 15 %) and gastrointestinal AEs ( 51 %). Grade III lymphopenia was detected only in 6 cases ( 2.4 %). We observed differences between the two clinics: discontinuation because of AEs was different ( Odds ratio 6.13 , 95 % CI: 3.0-12.7 , p < 0.001) , the mean treatment duration also differed ( 305.3 ± 186.3 vs 140.5 ± 114.4 days , p < 0.001) , and dissimilarities in adherence were mainly related to flushing , gastrointestinal AEs , and consideration of lymphopenia ( p < 0.0001). Better adherence was associated with prospectively planned management of gastrointestinal AEs and flushing. Adherence in real-life was similar to pivotal trials. Differences in discontinuation rates at two MS clinics underline importance of AE management.
