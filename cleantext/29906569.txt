  Although disease progression in mucopolysaccharidosis type I ( MPS-I) can be attenuated by hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT) , it is increasingly recognized that residual disease is substantial. Biomarkers that would allow us to evaluate the efficacy of HCT ( and upcoming new therapies) in nonhematologic tissues are needed. Current biomarkers , including the iduronidase ( IDUA) activity in leukocytes , are not suitable for this purpose because they are assessed in tissues of hematologic origin and may not reflect enzyme availability in nonhematologic tissues. Saliva is a nonhematologic body fluid that can be collected easily and noninvasively. We hypothesized that the extent of recovery of IDUA activity in saliva after HCT could provide a better understanding of the penetration of donor-derived enzyme into nonhematologic compartments. This study in 20 patients with MPS-I shows that the measurement of IDUA activity in saliva is possible and allows diagnosis of IDUA deficiency ( P < .0001) , with values a magnitude further deviating from the normal range than when assayed in corresponding dried blood spots ( DBSs). Furthermore , it could possibly differentiate between phenotypes ( P = .045). More importantly , patients exhibit strikingly low values of IDUA in saliva after HCT , far below the normal range of control subjects ( P = .013) , contrasting the normal IDUA levels in DBSs. We postulate that the limited recovery of donor-derived IDUA activity in saliva after treatment reflects the situation in poorly responding nonhematologic tissue compartments , unveiling enzyme delivery as a weak spot of the current therapy. Salivary IDUA activity could be used as a biomarker for the evaluation of the effect of new therapies in well-vascularized nonhematologic tissues.
