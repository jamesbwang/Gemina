  We aimed to determine the 6-year incidence and risk factors of age-related macular degeneration ( AMD) in first and second generations of Singaporean Indians. Baseline examination was conducted in 2007-9 and 6-year propsective follow-up examination of this Indian population in 2013-5. All participants underwent interviews with questionnaires and comprehensive medical and eye examinations. Incidence was age-standardized to Singaporean 2010 census. Risk factors associated with AMD incidence were assessed and compared between first and second generations of immigrants. Among 2200 persons who participated in the follow-up examination ( 75.5 % response rate) , gradable fundus photographs were available in 2105. The 6-year age-standardized incidences of early and late AMD were 5.26 % and 0.51 % respectively. Incident early AMD was associated with cardiovascular disease history ( HR 1.59 , 95 % CI 1.04-2.45) , underweight body mass index ( BMI) ( HR 3.12 , 95 % CI 1.37-7.14) ( BMI of < 18.5 vs 18.51-25 kg/m2) , heavy alcohol drinking ( HR 3.14 95 % CI 1.25-7.89) and ARMS2 rs3750847 homozygous genetic loci carrier ( HR 2.52 , 95 % CI 1.59-3.99). We found a relatively low incidence of early AMD in this Singaporean Indian population compared to Caucasian populations. Both first and second-generation Indian immigrants have similar incidence and risk factor patterns for early AMD.
