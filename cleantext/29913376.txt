  Compulsive buying is associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity , such as personality disorders. Few studies have focused on the dimensional model of personality disorders in compulsive buying. We aimed to assess the eventual presence of personality dysfunctions in compulsive buying according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder , 5th edition ( DSM-5) dimensional conception of personality disorders. We screened online compulsive buying ( QABB) , characterized purchasing behavior and explored DSM-5 personality trait domains ( Personality Inventory for DSM-5-Brief Form ( PID-5-BF)) in 233 Paris psychology students using an online self-reporting questionnaire. The prevalence of compulsive buying among students was 7.7 % ( n = 18). The favorite items purchased by compulsive buyers were clothing and cosmetic products. Three mean trait domain scores were significantly higher for CB + than CB- students: negative affect , detachment and disinhibition. Our findings suggest that compulsive buyers distinctively feature pathological DSM-5 dimensional personality trait domains.
