  To examine within an at-risk/clinical sample of preschool-aged children with externalizing problems: ( 1) which disruptive behavior and attention disorder symptoms ( i.e. , inattention , hyperactivity/impulsivity , and oppositionality/aggression) and ( 2) what aspects of parenting ( e.g. , discipline practices or stress) are related to children 's sleep problems ( e.g. , sleep habit and night waking problems). The sample consisted of 148 children ( meanage = 5.06 years , 82 % male) with at-risk/clinically elevated levels of externalizing behavior problems and their primary caregiver. As part of a larger study , parents reported on their stress and parenting practices and their children 's behavioral and sleep functioning. Positive and negative parenting behaviors ( `` do '' and `` do n't '' skills , respectively) were also observed during a 15-minute parent-child interaction during play. Oppositionality/aggression was the only disruptive behavior and attention disorder symptom associated with more sleep habit problems. Higher levels of inconsistent discipline and `` do n't '' skills were also associated with more sleep habit problems. Within a combined model , an interaction emerged such that the association between `` do n't '' skills and elevated sleep habit problems was only evident at low levels of inconsistent discipline. In terms of night waking problems , there was only an association with parenting stress , whereas the other parenting factors and disruptive behavior and attention disorder symptoms were unrelated. Although the directionality of our associations can not be ascertained because of the cross-sectional nature of our study , these findings , nevertheless , highlight the importance of parenting factors ( e.g. , inconsistent discipline and parenting stress) when considering sleep difficulties in young children with disruptive behavior and attention disorders.
