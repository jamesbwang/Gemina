  A steep rise in the incidences of neurodegenerative disorders could be the combined effect of several non-genetic factors such as increased life expectancy , environmental pollutants , lifestyle , and dietary habits , as the population-level genetic change would require multiple generations. Emerging evidence demonstrates that chronic over-nutrition induces brain metabolic stress and neuroinflammation , and both are individually known to promote neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , Parkinson 's disease ( PD) and Huntington 's disease ( HD). Although the association of metabolic disorders such as diabetes , hypertension , dyslipidemia , and atherosclerosis with the dietary habits is well known , the understanding of neuronal implications of diet and nutritional supplements is still in the infancy. Transcriptomics and proteomics-based studies support the view that nutraceuticals target multiple neuroprotective pathways in a slow but more physiological manner without causing severe adverse effects , and may represent the future of tackling neurodegenerative disorders. In this article , i) we review the diet/dietary supplement connection with the brain metabolic stress and neuroinflammation and ii) summarize the current advancements on the effects of nutraceuticals on the neurodegenerative disorders.
