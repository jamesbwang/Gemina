  Biliverdin reductase B ( BLVRB) is a newly identified cellular redox regulator that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of multiple substrates. Through mass spectrometry analysis , we identified high levels of BLVRB in mature red blood cells , highlighting the importance of BLVRB in redox regulation. The BLVRB conformational changes that occur during conezyme/substrate binding and the role of dynamics in BLVRB function , however , remain unknown. Through a combination of NMR , kinetics , and isothermal titration calorimetry studies , we determined that BLVRB binds its coenzyme 500-fold more tightly than its substrate. While the active site of apo BLVRB is highly dynamic on multiple timescales , active site dynamics are largely quenched within holo BLVRB , in which dynamics are redistributed to other regions of the enzyme. We show that a single point mutation of Arg78 âž” Ala leads to both an increase in active site micro-millisecond motions and an increase in the microscopic rate constants of coenzyme binding. This demonstrates that altering BLVRB active site dynamics can directly cause a change in functional characteristics. Our studies thus address the solution behavior of apo and holo BLVRB and identify a role of enzyme dynamics in coenzyme binding.
