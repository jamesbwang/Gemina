  Mangroves are often converted into gei wai ponds for aquaculture , but how such conversion affects the accumulation and behavior of heavy metals in sediments is not clear. The present study aims to quantify the concentration and speciation of heavy metals in sediments in different habitats , including gei wai pond , mangrove marsh dominated by Avicennia marina and bare mudflat , in a mangrove nature reserve in South China. The results showed that gei wai pond acidified the sediment and reduced its electronic conductivity and total organic carbon ( TOC) when compared to A. marina marsh and mudflat. The concentrations of Cd , Cu , Zn and Pb at all sediment depths in gei wai pond were lower than the other habitats , indicating gei wai pond reduced the fertility and the ability to retain heavy metals in sediment. Gei wai pond sediment also had a lower heavy metal pollution problem according to multiple evaluation methods , including potential ecological risk coefficient , potential ecological risk index , geo-accumulation index , mean PEL quotients , pollution load index , mean ERM quotients and total toxic unit. Heavy metal speciation analysis showed that gei wai pond increased the transfer of the immobilized fraction of Cd and Cr to the mobilized one. According to the acid-volatile sulfide ( AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals ( SEM) analysis , the conversion of mangroves into gei wai pond reduced values of ( ( SEM)- ( AVS))/ f
