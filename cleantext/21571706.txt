  To identify the processes that influence the evolution of family health teams ( FHTs). Qualitative study using grounded theory methodology. Family health teams in Ontario. A total of 110 team members from 20 FHT sites in Ontario. Individual semistructured interviews were conducted and data were analyzed using initial coding , focused coding , and a constant comparison analysis. The analysis illuminated the complex and diverse nature of the FHTs ' evolutionary trajectories , which were influenced by 7 discrete but interrelated processes: sharing a common philosophy about teamwork; having effective leadership; respecting each other 's scopes of practice; sharing the physical environment; including team activities; supporting conflict resolution; and managing change. The status of each site 's evolution was categorized as evolving , progressing , or stalled. The concept of evolution by its very definition does not imply stasis , and as the data revealed , change is always on the horizon. This study revealed 7 processes that influenced team evolution , and these processes were observed to be either optimally applied or noticeably limited in their execution , irrespective of team composition or configuration. These processes can be extrapolated to other primary health care teams to facilitate team evolution.
