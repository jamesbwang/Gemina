  To observe the effect of Schistosoma japonicum cysteine protease inhibitor ( rSjCystatin) for treatment of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced sepsis<disease> in mice. After a week of adaptive feeding , 54 BALB/c mice were randomly divided into normal control group ( group A) , sepsis<disease> group ( group B) , and rSjCystatin intervention group ( group C). The mice in group A received an intraperitoneal injection of PBS ( 100 µL) , and those in groups B and C were injected with PBS ( 100 µL) containing LPS ( 10 mg/kg); the mice in group C were also intraperitoneally injected with 25 µg sjCystatin in 100 µL PBS 30 min after LPS injection. From each group , 10 mice were randomly selected 24 h after PBS or LPS injection for detecting serum levels of TNF-α , IL-6 , and IL-10 using ELISA and the levels of ALT , AST , BUN , and Cr using automatic biochemical analyzer; the pathological changes in the liver , lung and kidney were observed with HE staining. The remaining 8 mice in each group were used for observing the changes in the general condition and the 72-h survival. The 72-h survival rates of the mice was 100 % in group A , 0 in group B , and 36 % in group C , showing a significant difference among the 3 groups ( P < 0.05). Compared with those in group A , the mice in group B exhibited obvious liver , lung , and renal pathologies with increased levels of ALT , AST , BUN , Cr , IL-6 , and TNF-α ( P < 0.05). Treatment with sjCystatin significantly lessened LPS-induced organ pathologies , lowered the levels of liver and renal functional indexes and the pro-inflammatory cytokines , and increased the serum level of IL-10 in the mice ( P < 0.05). SjCystatin can produce a significant therapeutic effect on sepsis<disease> induced by LPS in mice.
