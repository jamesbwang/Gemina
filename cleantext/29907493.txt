  New techniques to investigate functional network connectivity in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data have recently emerged. One novel approach , called meta-state analysis , goes beyond the mere cross-correlation of time courses of distinct brain areas and explores temporal dynamism in more detail , allowing for connectivity states to overlap in time and capturing global dynamic behavior. Previous studies have shown that patients with chronic schizophrenia exhibit reduced neural dynamism compared to healthy controls , but it is not known whether these alterations extend to earlier phases of the illness. In this study , we analyzed individuals at clinical high-risk ( CHR , n = 53) for developing psychosis , patients in an early stage of schizophrenia ( ESZ , n = 58) , and healthy controls ( HC , n = 70). ESZ individuals exhibit reduced neural dynamism across all domains compared to HC. CHR individuals also show reduced neural dynamism but only in 2 out of 4 domains investigated. Overall , meta-state analysis adds information about dynamic fluidity of functional connectivity.
