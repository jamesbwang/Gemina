  Active plasmonics is enabling novel devices such as switchable metasurfaces for active beam steering or dynamic holography. Magnesium with its particle plasmon resonances in the visible spectral range is an ideal material for this technology. Upon hydrogenation , metallic magnesium switches reversibly into dielectric magnesium hydride ( MgH
