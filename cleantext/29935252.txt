  We sought to quantify the association between child incarceration in the U.S. and subsequent adult health outcomes. We analyzed National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health data from 1,727 adult ( Wave IV) participants first incarcerated at age < 25. Using Chi-squared tests and multivariate logistic regression models , we compare adult health outcomes ( mobility limitations , depressive symptoms , suicidal thoughts) among those first incarcerated at age ≤ 14 , 15-17 , and 18-20 , with 21-24 as the reference group. Of the 1,727 participants , 105 ( 6.7 %) were first incarcerated at age ≤ 14 ( `` child incarceration category '') , 315 ( 19.3 %) at age 15-17 , 696 ( 38.5 %) at age 18-20 , and 611 ( 35.6 %) at age 21-24. Those incarcerated as children ( age ≤ 14) were disproportionately black or Hispanic compared to those incarcerated at age 15-24. Compared with first incarceration at age 21-24 , child incarceration independently predicted adult mobility limitations ( adjusted odds ratio ( OR) = 3.74; p = 0.001) , adult depression<symptom> ( OR = 1.98; p = 0.034) , and adult suicidal thoughts ( OR = 4.47; p = 0.005). Child incarceration displays even wider sociodemographic disparities than incarceration generally and is associated with even worse adult physical and mental health outcomes.
