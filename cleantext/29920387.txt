  Ventriculitis is a serious complication when using external ventricular drains ( EVDs). Bactericidal silver coating has been reported to reduce risk of infection. In the clinical setting , the diagnosis is often made based on symptoms and analyses of cerebrospinal fluid , with treatment initiated before infection is verified by culture. The bactericidal effect might not correlate with a reduced rate of clinically diagnosed infections. This retrospective study aimed to analyze if use of silver-coated EVDs is associated with a reduced rate of ventriculitis. During 1 year , clinical routine was changed from inserting noncoated catheters to silver-coated catheters. Rate of ventriculitis was compared between patient groups based on catheter type. To examine the clinical impact of silver coating , ventriculitis was defined as cases where antibiotic treatment was initiated on clinical suspicion. Among 296 patients ( 186 noncoated and 110 silver-coated catheters) , 18.9 % were treated for ventriculitis , with 21.0 % in the noncoated group and 15.5 % in the silver-coated group ( P = 0.242). Silver coating did not reduce the rate of positive cultures. Duration of EVD treatment was the single significant risk factor for ventriculitis. Silver-coated catheters did not reduce the need for cerebrospinal fluid shunt placement , days with antibiotics , days with EVD , or days in the intensive care unit. The previously reported bactericidal effect of silver-coated EVDs did not alter the clinical course to significantly reduce the number of treated cases of ventriculitis. The introduction of silver-coated EVDs can not be motivated by reduced use of antibiotics or shorter hospital stay.
