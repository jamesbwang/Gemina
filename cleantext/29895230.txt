  Synopsis Patients with low-back pain have been shown to display differences compared to healthy individuals in all aspects of trunk motor control , most often studied as differences in muscle activity and kinematics. However , differences in these aspects of motor control are largely inconsistent. We propose that this may reflect existence of two phenotypes , possibly the two ends of a distribution , one with `` tight '' control over trunk movement and one with `` loose '' control. Both may have beneficial effects , with tight control protecting against large tissue strains from uncontrolled movement and loose control protecting against high muscle forces and resulting spinal compression. Both may also have long-term negative consequences. Whereas tight control may cause for example high compressive loading on the spine and sustained muscle activity , loose control may cause excessive tensile strains of tissues. Moreover , both phenotypes could be the result of either an adaptation process aimed at protecting the low back , or from direct interference of low-back pain and related changes with trunk motor control. The existence of such phenotypes would suggest different motor control exercise interventions. Although some promising data supporting these phenotypes have been reported , it remains to be shown whether these phenotypes are valid , how treatment can be targeted to these phenotypes and whether this targeting yields superior clinical outcomes.
