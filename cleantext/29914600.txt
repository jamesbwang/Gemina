  Tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) control requires accurate knowledge of TB incidence , but few studies have been published on TB incidence using individual data from drug prescriptions. To measure the estimated completeness of regional surveillance system data before and after adding data from anti-tuberculosis drug prescriptions. We compiled data on all individuals who received specific anti-tuberculosis drugs from three sources-the passive surveillance system , the active surveillance system and the anti-tuberculosis drug prescription database-in the Balearic Islands , Spain , between 2010 and 2012. We applied the capture-recapture method to measure completeness of data reporting. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05 , and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were calculated. We detected 605 incident cases , compared with an estimated incidence of 719 cases ( 95 % CI 646-793) , representing 84.1 % data completeness. We detected 480 of an estimated 559 pulmonary TB cases ( 95 % CI 501-617; 85.9 % data completeness) and 125 of an estimated 161 extra-pulmonary TB cases ( 95 % CI 113-211; 77.6 % data completeness). By adding a new source , we increased detection with respect to a previous study by 10.4 % for all forms of TB , 9.7 % for pulmonary TB and 13 % for extra-pulmonary TB.
