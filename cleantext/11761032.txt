  Oxford Cognitive Screen is designed for assessing cognitive functions of poststroke patients. This study was aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Chinese ( Putonghua) version of the Oxford Cognitive Screen-Putonghua ( OCS-P) for use among poststroke patients without neglect. Expert review panel evaluated content validity of the Chinese-translated items. After pilot tested the translated items , the patients and healthy participants completed the OCS-P as well as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA-ChiB) and Goldenberg 's test. A group of patients completed OCS-P for the second time within seven days. Data analyses included confirmatory factor analysis , item difficulty and item-total correlation , inter- and intrarater reliability , internal consistency , and between-group discrimination. One hundred patients and 120 younger ( This study generated satisfactory evidence on the content validity , substantive validity , construct validity , inter- and intrarater reliability , and known-group discrimination of the OCS-P. They support its application among poststroke patients who speak Putonghua. Future studies could review the existing five-dimension domains for improving its structural validity and internal consistency as well as generate evidence of the OCS-P for use among the poststroke patients with neglect.
