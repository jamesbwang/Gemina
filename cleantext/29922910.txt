  Measures to raise awareness of the teratogenic potential of valproate and restrict its use in girls/women of childbearing age have been intensified. For Germany , the impact of these measures on valproate prescription rates remains unknown. Trends in prescribing valproate , the underlying treatment indication , and the specialty of the prescribing physician are analyzed. With claims data from several statutory health insurance providers from 2004 to 2016 ( approximately 3.5 million insured persons per year) considering treatment indication and medical specialties of prescribing physicians , we assessed the rate of girls/women ( 12 to 50 years) with at least one valproate dispensation per year. The age-standardized rate of girls/women with at least one valproate dispensation declined by 28 % between 2004 and 2016 ( 2.91/ 1000 vs. 2.09/ 1000). For 2015 , the indications were epilepsy ( 66.9 %) , bipolar disorder ( 13.6 %) , migraine/headache ( 5.6 %) , schizoaffective disorder ( 4.3 %) , and other mental disorders ( 8.9 %). Among epilepsy patients , the proportion treated with valproate declined from 26.2 to 16.8 % , but changed little in patients with bipolar disorder ( 9.3 % vs. 8.0 %). A total of 46.3 % of valproate dispensations were issued by neurologists or psychiatrists and 29.6 % by general practitioners , internal medicine specialists , or family doctors. Based on German claims data , a decline of valproate dispensations was shown for epilepsy patients of childbearing age , while the proportion in other indications has hardly changed since 2004.
