  The development of fast-acting and highly stable insulin analogues is challenging. Insulin undergoes structural transitions essential for binding and activation of the insulin receptor ( IR) , but these conformational changes can also affect insulin stability. Previously , we substituted the insulin A6-A11 cystine with a rigid , non-reducible C = C linkage ( `` dicarba '' linkage). A
