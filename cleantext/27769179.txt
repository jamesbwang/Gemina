  Several studies have shown an increased accumulation of terminally differentiated T cells during HIV<pathogen> infection , suggestive of exhaustion/senescence , causing dysregulation of T cell homeostasis and function and rapid HIV<pathogen> disease progression. We have investigated whether long-term antiretroviral therapy ( ART) , which controls viremia and restores CD4 T cell counts , is correlated with reduction in terminally differentiated T cells , improved ratios of naïve to memory and function of T cells in 100 virologically controlled HIV-infected patients. We show that while the median frequencies of terminally differentiated CD4 + and CD8 + T cells ( CD28- , CD27- , CD57 + and CD28-CD57 +) , were higher in the virologically controlled HIV-infected patients ' cohort compared with uninfected individuals ' cohort , the frequencies of these cells significantly decreased with increasing CD4 T cell counts in HIV-infected patients. Although , the naïve CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were lower in HIV<pathogen> patients ' cohort than uninfected cohort , there was a significant increase in both naïve CD4 + and CD8 + T cells with increasing CD4 T cell counts in HIV-infected patients. The underlying mechanism behind this increased naïve CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in HIV-infected patients was due to an increase in recent thymic emigrants , CD4 + CD31 + , as compared to CD4 + CD31-. The CD4 + T cells of HIV-infected patients produced cytokines , including IL-2 , IL-10 and IFN-γ comparable to uninfected individuals. In conclusion , virologically controlled HIV-infected patients on long-term ART show a significant reduction in terminally differentiated T cells , suggestive of decreased exhaustion/senescence , and improvement in the ratios of naïve to memory and function of T cells.
