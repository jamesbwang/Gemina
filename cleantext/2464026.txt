  Pathogen or diet-induced immune activation can partition energy and nutrients away from growth , but clear relationships between immune responses and the direction and magnitude of energy partitioning responses have yet to be elucidated. The objectives were to determine how β-mannanase supplementation and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) immune stimulation affect maintenance energy requirements ( MEm) and to characterize immune parameters , digestibility , growth performance , and energy balance<symptom>. In a randomized complete block design , 30 young weaned pigs were assigned to either the control treatment ( CON; basal corn , soybean meal and soybean hulls diet) , the enzyme treatment ( ENZ; basal diet + 0.056 % β-mannanase) , or the immune system stimulation treatment ( ISS; basal diet + 0.056 % β-mannanase , challenged with repeated increasing doses of Beta-mannanase supplementation did not affect immune status , nutrient digestibility , growth performance , energy balance<symptom> , or ME This experiment provides novel data on β-mannanase supplementation effects on immune parameters and energy balance<symptom> in pigs and is the first to directly relate decreased ADG to increased ME
