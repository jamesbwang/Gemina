  Studies from various parts of the world have shown that teachers are likely to suffer from burnout. So far , there has been no research on burnout among primary school teachers in Basrah , Iraq. We aimed to determine the prevalence and predisposing factors of self-reported burnout among primary school teachers in Basrah. This was a cross-sectional study in 32 governmental primary schools during November 2014-February 2015. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic and work-related data using the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. Of 800 questionnaires distributed , 706 ( 88.3 %) were completed; 58.4 % were from women. The prevalence of burnout was 24.5 % ( 95 % CI: 21.5-27.8). A statistically significant association was found between burnout and age , sex and marital status. Work-related factors that showed significant association with burnout were: work overload , problems related to career advancement , high number of students per class and student misbehaviour. Burnout is an important health problem among primary school teachers in Basrah. A number of risk factors , particularly those related to work , are amenable to modification since they are related to the education policy.
