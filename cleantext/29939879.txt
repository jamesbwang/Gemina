  To investigate the correlation between a plateau in minute ventilation VE during cardiopulmonary exercise tests ( CPETs) and its impact on cardiac performance. This retrospective study analyzed 2575 CPETs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study randomly selected 10 patients with a plateau in the VE curve , suggesting dynamic hyperinflation , 10 patients with normal pattern for the VE curve , and 10 healthy persons. Classic CPET variables , the new ventilation hyperinflation index , and the dynamic cardiac constraint index were analyzed. The patients with dynamic hyperinflation presented with lower ventilation at 100 % work rate ( P < .0001) , without significant differences in VE at 50 % and 100 % work rate. Patients with dynamic hyperinflation also presented with a lower oxygen pulse ( O2 pulse) at 100 % ( P < .0001) , without significant difference in O2 pulse at 50 % and 100 % work rate. The subjects with dynamic hyperinflation had a higher ventilation hyperinflation index ( P < .0001) and dynamic cardiac constraints index ( P < .0001). The ventilation hyperinflation index correlated with the dynamic cardiac constraints index ( r = 0.81 , P < .0001); oxygen pulse variation ( r = -0.63 , P < .001); VE/VCO2 slope ( r = -0.57 , P < .01); work rate ( r = -0.86 , P < .0001); VO2 ( r = -0.80 , P < .0001) , and VE ( r = -0.83 , P < .0001). There is a correlation between a plateau in the VE during CPET , suggesting hyperinflation , and it has an impact on cardiac performance.
