  Although atopic dermatitis<disease> ( AD) has significant impacts on quality of life , data from Canada on the subject are limited. This survey aims to assess the burden of moderate to severe AD on quality of life and disease management for pediatric patients and their caregivers in Canada. The Eczema Society of Canada conducted an online national cross-sectional survey in English and French. We included children with self-reported moderate to severe AD. We present descriptive statistics from the survey. Of all initial respondents ( n = 658) , 70 % ( n = 458) were children or caregivers of children who have moderate or severe AD and were therefore eligible. Among them , 27 % ( 123/451) are managed by a dermatologist , with 71 % ( 174/244) waiting more than 3 months to see a dermatologist. Many respondents ( 85 % , 279/330) feel that their child 's AD is not well controlled , and 27 % ( 75/275) have difficulty obtaining treatments for their child 's AD. Impaired quality of life was found in 52 % of families ( 200/381) , with most reporting sleep disturbances in both the child ( 70 % , 253/361) and the caregiver ( 55 % , 199/361) , as well as mental health issues. This survey demonstrates the medical and psychosocial burden of moderate to severe AD in Canadian children. Quality of life , access to care , and disease management are all areas of concern for patients and their families and warrant attention from individual clinicians and the health care system as a whole.
