  Renal iron recycling preserves the filtered iron from urinary excretion. However , it remains debated whether ferroportin ( FPN) , the solely known iron exporter , is functionally involved in renal iron recycling , and whether renal iron recycling is required for systemic iron homeostasis. We deleted FPN in the whole nephrons using a Nestin-Cre and in the distal nephrons and collecting ducts using a Ksp-Cre , and investigated its impacts on renal iron recycling and systemic iron homeostasis. FPN deletion by Nestin-Cre but not by Ksp-Cre caused excess iron retention and increased ferritin heavy chain ( FTH1) specifically in the proximal tubules , and resulted in the reduction of serum and hepatic iron. The systemic iron redistribution was aggravated resulting in anemia<symptom> and the marked downregulation of hepatic hepcidin in elderly FPN KO/Nestin-Cre mice. Similarly , in iron deficient FPN KO/Nestin-Cre mice , the renal iron retention worsened anemia<symptom> with the activation of the EPO-ERFE-HAMP1 pathway and the downregulation of hepatic hepcidin. Hence , FPN likely located at the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubules to export iron into the circulation and was required for renal iron recycling and systemic iron homeostasis particularly in elderly and iron deficient mice. Moreover , FPN deletion in the proximal tubules alleviated ischemic acute kidney injury possibly by upregulating FTH1 to limit catalytic iron and by priming anti-oxidant mechanisms , indicating that FPN could be deleterious in the pathophysiology of ischemic AKI , and thus may be a potential target for the prevention and mitigation of ischemic AKI.
