  According to data from the WHO , maternal mortality ratio has dropped worldwide by 44 % between 1990 and 2015 , yet more than 300,000 mothers still die annually , about 99 % of them in the developing countries. In some developed countries the incidence of maternal deaths has even increased during the past 2 decades. The leading causes of direct maternal deaths are haemorrhage ( nearly 3-quarters from postpartum haemorrhage) , pulmonary embolism including amniotic fluid embolism , and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; the leading cause of indirect maternal deaths is cardiac disease of the mother. The most important step to prevent maternal deaths is the accurate evaluation of each death by a multidisciplinary committee of independent experts , followed by consensus-based agreement on the underlying cause of death , the quality of care , and whether or not the death was preventable. The UK Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths and Morbidity are internationally recognized as the ` gold standard ' in maternal mortality surveillance. Considering the 11 studies from different developed countries , nearly 50 % of direct maternal deaths ( range: 26-75 %) are potentially preventable , most often those due to postpartum haemorrhage and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy , and the fewest of all due to amniotic fluid embolisms. The crucial point is to learn from failures leading to maternal deaths: each obstetric unit should scrutinise if and where the need for improvement exists to prevent severe maternal morbidity and mortality.
