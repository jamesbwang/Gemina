  We introduce a method to allow the screening of large configurational spaces of heteroatom distributions in zeotype materials. Based on interatomic potential calculations of configurations containing up to two heteroatoms per cell , we parameterize an atomistic effective Hamiltonian to describe the energy of multiple substitutions , with consideration of both short- and long-range interactions. Then , the effective Hamiltonian is used to explore the full configurational space at other compositions , allowing the identification of the most stable structures for further analysis. We illustrate our approach with the aluminogermanate PKU-9 , where we show that increasing the aluminium concentration changes the likely siting of Al , in agreement with experiment.
