  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between serum sodium at the time of diagnosis and long term clinical outcomes in a large national cohort of patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction. We studied 25 440 patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction treated at Veterans Affairs medical centers across the United States between 2002 and 2012. Serum sodium at the time of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> diagnosis was analyzed as a continuous variable and in categories as follows: low ( 115.00-134.99 mmol/L) , low-normal ( 135.00-137.99 mmol/L) , referent group ( 138.00-140.99 mmol/L) , high normal ( 141.00-143.99 mmol/L) , and high ( 144.00-160.00 mmol/L). Multivariable Cox regression and negative binomial regression were performed to estimate hazard ratios ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI)) and incidence density ratios ( 95 % CI) for the associations of serum sodium with mortality and hospitalizations ( heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and all-cause) , respectively. The average age of patients was 70.8 years , 96.2 % were male , and 14 % were black. Compared with the referent group , low , low-normal , and high sodium values were associated with 36 % ( 95 % CI , 28 % -44 %) , 6 % ( 95 % CI , 1 % -12 %) , and 9 % ( 95 % CI , 1 % -17 %) higher risk of all-cause mortality , respectively. Low and low-normal serum sodium were associated with 48 % ( 95 % CI , 10 % -100 %) and 38 % ( 95 % CI , 8 % -77 %) higher risk of number of days of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> hospitalizations per year , and with 44 % ( 95 % CI , 32 % -56 %) and 18 % ( 95 % CI , 10 % -27 %) higher risk of number of days of all-cause hospitalizations per year , respectively. Both elevated and reduced serum sodium , including values currently considered within normal range , are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction.
