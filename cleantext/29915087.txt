  Many mammalian genes are transcribed during short bursts of variable frequencies and sizes that substantially contribute to cell-to-cell variability. However , which molecular mechanisms determine bursting properties remains unclear. To probe putative mechanisms , we combined temporal analysis of transcription along the circadian cycle with multiple genomic reporter integrations , using both short-lived luciferase live microscopy and single-molecule RNA-FISH. Using the
