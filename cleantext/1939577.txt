  The purpose<pathogen> of the research<pathogen> is to characterize Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> colonization<pathogen> in healthy population<pathogen> of Algiers , to assess the impact<pathogen> on diagnostic performance<pathogen> of systematic additional broth<pathogen> enrichment<pathogen> , and to ascertain the additional benefits<pathogen> of multiple site<pathogen> screening<pathogen>. In order<pathogen> to more accurately determine the prevalence<pathogen> of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> colonization<pathogen> , the swab<pathogen> specimens<pathogen> from multiple screening<pathogen> sites<pathogen> were incubated in brain-heart broth<pathogen> before agar<pathogen> plating<pathogen>. From 2009 to 2011 , 1176 samples<pathogen> were collected from 459 participants<pathogen> ( 201 adults<pathogen> and 258 children<pathogen>). The additional enrichment<pathogen> detection<pathogen> step<pathogen> significantly increased S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> detection<pathogen> rates<pathogen> ( p<pathogen> < 0.0001). S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> nasal detection<pathogen> was positive in 37.8 %<pathogen> of adults<pathogen> , and the addition<pathogen> of throat<pathogen> samplings<pathogen> significantly increased the S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> detection<pathogen> rate<pathogen> up to 54.7 %<pathogen> ( p<pathogen> < 0.001). S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> nasal detection<pathogen> was positive in 37.6 %<pathogen> of children<pathogen>. The addition<pathogen> of throat<pathogen> samplings<pathogen> in children<pathogen> significantly increased the S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> detection<pathogen> rate<pathogen> up to 53.1 %<pathogen> ( p<pathogen> < 0.001) and that of anal samplings<pathogen> up to 59.7 %<pathogen>. The overall prevalence<pathogen> of methicillin-resistant S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> was 5.2 %<pathogen> ( 3 %<pathogen> of adults<pathogen> and 7 %<pathogen> of children<pathogen>). spa<pathogen> typing<pathogen> of all isolates<pathogen> revealed a diverse but strongly clonal S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> population<pathogen> structure<pathogen>. This approach<pathogen> involving multiple anatomical sampling<pathogen> sites<pathogen> and an additional enrichment<pathogen> of the swabs<pathogen> before conventional culture<pathogen> significantly increases the detection<pathogen> rate<pathogen> of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> carriers<pathogen> and may prove valuable to improve global
