  The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficiency of a natural flavonoid , Chrysin ( Chr) , encapsulated in PLGA-PEG nanoparticles ( NPs) for the modulation of macrophage polarity from the pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. The synthetized NPs were characterized using FTIR , DLS and FE-SEM. MTT assay was used to assess the toxicity of different concentration of Chr-encapsulated NPs on LPS/IFN-γ stimulated peritoneal exudate<symptom> macrophages. To investigate the repolarization efficiency of Chr-encapsulated NPs , real-time PCR was applied to measure M1 ( iNOS and SOCS3) and M2 ( Arg1 and Fizz) markers expression. Also , the relative mRNA and protein expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 , IL-1β and TNF-α were investigated in M1 macrophages treated with Chr-encapsulated NPs. Findings revealed that the Chr-encapsulated NPs with spherical shape and an average diameter of 235 nm were considerably less toxic to the macrophages. Additionally , the nano-formulated Chr efficiently showed a reduction in M1 markers and an increase in M2 markers levels than free Chr. Furthermore , macrophage phenotype switching by PLGA-PEG encapsulated Chr NPs significantly suppressed LPS/IFN-γ induced inﬂammation by a remarkable reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels , TNF-α , IL-1β , and IL-6. Convincingly , the results revealed that PLGA-PEG encapsulated Chr based drug delivery system might be introduced into biomaterials to fabricate bioactive smart multifunctional nanocomposites with macrophage repolarization activities for regenerative medicine purposes.
