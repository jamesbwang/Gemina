  To determine the diagnostic value of combining conventional MRI , diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI ( DCE-MRI) in salivary gland tumors. 45 patients with salivary gland tumors were evaluated with conventional MRI , DWI and DCE-MRI prior to surgery and confirmed by pathologic findings. The apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) was calculated from DWI that was obtained with a factor of 0 and 1000 s mm In conventional MRI , benign tumors often showed well-defined and clear margins , malignant tumors showed irregular margins or infiltration into the surrounding tissue. There were significant differences with regard to the ADC values between pleomorphic adenoma ( 1.72 ± 0.29 × 10 An evaluation combining MRI morphologic findings and functional MRI ( ADCs and TIC) appears to be useful in differentiating benign from malignant tumors in salivary gland tumors. Advances in knowledge: The study firstly dealt with the combination of conventional MRI , DWI-MRI with DCE-MRI in salivary gland tumors.
