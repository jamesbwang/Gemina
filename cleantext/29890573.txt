  Fluoride ( F) , naturally found in aquifers around the world at toxic concentrations , causes disease in millions of people. The long-term stability , however , of those concentrations within intensively pumped aquifers is poorly characterized. We assessed long-term stability in the spatial distribution of F concentrations in an intensively pumped aquifer within the semi-arid , inter-montane Independence Basin in central Mexico between 1999 and 2016. Although stable in 16 re-sampled wells , F concentrations increased in some localities across the basin by as much as 4mg/L. Changes in recharge pathways to the deep aquifer were identified by analyzing changes in Î´
