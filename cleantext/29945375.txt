  Six kinds of provenance of Rheum tanguticum collected from Qinghai province as the test materials , which were transplanted under 3 different environments by using complete randomized block design with three replicates. The contents of the chemical components was determined by HPLC. This study aimed at analyzing the effect of genotype , environment and their interactions on the 4 kinds of functional components ( phenolic acids , bianthrone , free anthraquinones and combined anthraquinones) in 14 kinds of active components of Rh. tanguticum , in order to provide a theoretical basis for the selection of cultivated Rh. tanguticum in high quality producing area and excellent provenance. The provenance trial showed that the genotype and environment influence on the effect of all kinds of functional components in Rh. tanguticum were significant (
