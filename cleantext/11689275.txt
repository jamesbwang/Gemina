  This study aimed to determine the prevalence and potential risk factors of obesity among women in Turkey. The data source was the Turkey Demographic and Health Survey ( TDHS) in 1998 , 2003 , 2008 and 2013 , conducted by Hacettepe University Institute of Population Studies. Cross-tables and binary logistic regression were used in the study. Obesity was a serious problem among women in Turkey. Obesity rate was 21.7 % in 1998 and increased to 26.5 % in 2013. Age , education level , the number of births , region , residence , and wealth status were included as potential risk factors. Age was an important variable affecting obesity and increased with age. There was an inverse relationship between obesity and education level. Women having no education or not completed primary school and those who were not working were higher at obesity risk. Obesity increased with the giving births of mothers. Obesity was mostly observed in the West<disease> and Central. As household welfare increased , obesity increased except for 2013 research. Preventive interventions should be announced particularly among urban women in Turkey. Women should be stimulated by physical activities and informed by realistic food policies.
