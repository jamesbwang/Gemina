  We measured immunosuppression at myeloma diagnosis and assessed the impact on survival in 5826 UK myeloma trial patients. Polyclonal immunoglobulin levels were below normal in 85 % of patients and above normal in only 0.4 % of cases for IgA , 0.2 % for IgM and no cases for IgG. Immunoparesis had a greater impact in recent trials: median overall survival ( OS) was up to 3 years longer for patients without immunoparesis compared to the old trials , less than 1 year longer. Median progression-free survival ( PFS) was 39 % , 36 % and 57 % longer for patients with normal IgG , IgA and IgM levels , respectively. The depth of IgM suppression , but not the depth of IgG or IgA suppression , was prognostic for survival: the most severely suppressed IgM tertile of patients OS was 0.9 years shorter than those in the top tertile , and 2.6 years shorter than OS of those with normal IgM levels ( p = .007). The degree of suppression of polyclonal IgM levels below normal was associated with worse PFS ( p = .0002). Infection does not appear to be the main mechanism through which immunoparesis affects survival. We hypothesise that IgM immunoparesis impacts through a combination of being associated with more aggressive disease and reduced immune surveillance against relapse.
