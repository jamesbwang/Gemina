  The New Sexual Satisfaction Scale ( NSSS) is an internationally established questionnaire for assessing sexual satisfaction. It is based on 2 subscales ( ego-centered and partner- and sexual activity-centered sexual satisfaction). The aim of the study was to evaluate the German short version of the questionnaire ( NSSS-SD) in a representative sample ( N = 2524). In addition , relationships between sexual satisfaction and sociodemographic factors ( age , sex , education) and characteristics of partnership and sexuality ( relationship satisfaction , coitus frequency , number of sexual partners) were examined. The internal consistency of the NSSS-SD was excellent ( Cronbach 's Alpha = 0.96). The 2-dimensional structure of the long version could not be confirmed for the short version. One factor could be extracted , which explains 68.94 % of the variance. An analysis of variance ( ANOVA) revealed statistically significant differences in sexual satisfaction with respect to age , education , relationship satisfaction and coitus frequency. Sex and number of sexual partners did not influence sexual satisfaction. The NSSS-SD is a reliable questionnaire of sexual satisfaction for sexually active individuals. For sexually inactive individuals , a change of the instruction or a visual analogue scale might be useful.
