  Clinical applications of many small molecules are limited due to poor solubility and lack of controlled release besides lack of other desirable properties. Experimental and computational studies have reported on the therapeutic potential of polyamidoamine ( PAMAM) dendrimers as solubility enhancers in pre-clinical and clinical settings. Besides formulation strategies , factors such as pH , PAMAM dendrimer generation , PAMAM dendrimer concentration , nature of the PAMAM core , special ligand and surface modifications of PAMAM dendrimer have an influence on drug solubility and other recommendable pharmacological properties. This review , therefore , compiles the recently reported applications of PAMAM dendrimers in pre-clinical and clinical uses as enhancers of solubility and other desirable properties such as sustained and controlled release , bioavailability , bio-distribution , toxicity reduction or enhancement , and targeted delivery of small molecules with emphasis on cancer treatment.
