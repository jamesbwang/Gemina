  Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS) and fine-mapping efforts to date have identified more than 100 prostate cancer ( PrCa)- susceptibility loci. We meta-analyzed genotype data from a custom high-density array of 46,939 PrCa cases and 27,910 controls of European ancestry with previously genotyped data of 32,255 PrCa cases and 33,202 controls of European ancestry. Our analysis identified 62 novel loci associated ( P < 5.0 Ã— 10
