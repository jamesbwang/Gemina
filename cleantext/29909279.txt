  Integrin-mediated cell adhesion plays key roles for cell movement during development and tissue homeostasis. The dynamic life cycle of various integrin adhesions structures is required for the cell movements and regulated by the coordinated actions of both actomyosin and the microtubule ( MT) cytoskeleton. The evolutionarily conserved Kank family proteins have emerged as regulators of adhesion dynamics by coordinating integrin-mediated force transmission with the recruitment of microtubules to integrins. These novel functions may play important roles in vivo and in
