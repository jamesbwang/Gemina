  We have shown previously that nitidine chloride ( NC) induces apoptosis via inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3). However , its downstream molecules are not fully understood yet. Here , we report that NC as STAT3 inhibitor downregulates myeloid cell leukemia-1 ( Mcl-1) protein in HSC-3 and HSC-4 human oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC) cells and a nude mouse tumor xenograft model. This study investigated the effects of NC on Mcl-1 expression in HSC-3 and HSC-4 cells using Western blotting , RT-PCR , and dual-luciferase assay. Immunohistochemistry was employed to evaluate Mcl-1 expression levels in mouse tumor tissues. Construction of Mcl-1 overexpression vector and transient transfection was done to test the apoptosis of HSC-3 cells. Nitidine chloride did not affect either mRNA level or promoter activity of Mcl-1 , and the decrease in Mcl-1 protein by NC was caused by lysosome-dependent degradation , but not proteasome-dependent degradation. The overexpression of Mcl-1 protein in OSCC cell lines was sufficient to block the induction of apoptosis. In addition , NC strongly reduced the expression level of Mcl-1 protein compared with other STAT3 inhibitors such as cryptotanshione and S3I-201 in OSCCs. Our findings suggest that NC triggers apoptosis via lysosome-dependent Mcl-1 protein degradation and could be chosen as a promising chemotherapeutic candidate against human OSCCs.
