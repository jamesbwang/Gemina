  In intractable cardiogenic shock<symptom> , extracorporeal life support frequently is the last treatment option. Outcomes of prolonged veno-arterial extracorporeal life support for cardiac failure are poorly defined. We retrospectively analyzed 10 patients ( 4 females , age = 36 ± 16 years) who underwent prolonged extracorporeal life support ( ≥ 7 days) from December 2015 to March 2017 for cardiogenic shock<symptom>. The primary endpoint was survival to hospital discharge. Etiologies included ischemic cardiomyopathy with non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( n = 1) , dilated ( n = 3) , hypertrophic ( n = 1) , postpartum cardiomyopathy ( n = 1) , and others ( n = 4). Heart<symptom> failure<symptom> was left or biventricular in 80.0 % ( left ventricular ejection fraction = 15.6 ± 5.5 %). Among the 10 patients , 80.0 % underwent femoral and 20.0 % central cannulation , 40.0 % required changes in the cannulation strategy , and 80.0 % underwent left ventricular venting. No technical malfunctions occurred , but 50.0 % required circuit exchanges for thrombus formation. 80.0 % suffered from infections. 60.0 % could be decannulated after 717 ± 830 ( 168-2301) h of support , and survival to hospital discharge was 40.0 %. Longest follow-up available is 160 ± 175 ( 12-409) days after discharge , with 30.0 % alive and in satisfying functional condition. Prolonged veno-arterial extracorporeal life support for cardiac failure is feasible with low technical complication rates. Survival rates are acceptable , yet inferior to short-term support. We observed a shift from initial shock-related complications to infections during prolonged support. Since recovery and thus weaning is rather unlikely after a prolonged need for extracorporeal life support , this form of support should be limited to centers offering the full spectrum of interdisciplinary cardiac care including ventricular assist device implantation and transplantation.
