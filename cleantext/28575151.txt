  The main pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) are the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques , primarily consisting of amyloid-β ( Aβ) peptide , and the accumulation of paired helical filaments of hyperphosphorylated tau protein ( PHF-Tau) within neurons. Since CA1 is one of the most affected regions in AD , mainly at early stages , we have performed a detailed analysis of the CA1 region from 11 AD patients ( demented and clinically similar; Braak stages IV-VI) to better understand the possible relationship between the presence and distribution of different neurochemical types of Aβ plaques and PHF-Tau immunoreactive (- ir) neurons. Hence , we have examined hippocampal sections in confocal microscopy images from double and triple-immunostained sections , to study labeled plaques and PHF-Tau-ir neurons using specific software tools. There are four main findings in the present study. First , the pyramidal layer of proximal CA1 ( close to CA2) contains the smallest number of both plaques and PHF-Tau-ir neurons. Second , a large proportion of Aβ-ir plaques were also characterized by the presence of PHF-Tau-ir. Third , all plaques containing one of the two PHF-Tau isoforms also express the other isoform , that is , if a plaque contains PHFpS396 , it also contains PHFAT8 , and vice versa. Fourth , the coexpression study of both PHF-Tau isoforms in CA1 neurons revealed that most of the labeled neurons express only PHFpS396. Our findings further support the idea that AD is not a unique entity even within the same neuropathological stage , since the microanatomical/neurochemical changes that occur in the hippocampus greatly vary from one patient to another.
