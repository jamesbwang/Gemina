  Suboptimal early-life conditions affect the developing kidney , resulting in long-term programming effects , namely renal programming. Adverse renal programming increases the risk for developing hypertension and kidney disease in adulthood. Conversely , reprogramming is a strategy aimed at reversing the programming processes in early life. AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK) plays a key role in normal renal physiology and the pathogenesis of hypertension and kidney disease. This review discusses the regulation of AMPK in the kidney and provides hypothetical mechanisms linking AMPK to renal programming. This will be followed by studies targeting AMPK activators like metformin , resveratrol , thiazolidinediones , and polyphenols as reprogramming strategies to prevent hypertension and kidney disease. Further studies that broaden our understanding of AMPK isoform- and tissue-specific effects on renal programming are needed to ultimately develop reprogramming strategies. Despite the fact that animal models have provided interesting results with regard to reprogramming strategies targeting AMPK signaling to protect against hypertension and kidney disease with developmental origins , these results await further clinical translation.
