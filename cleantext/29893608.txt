  To examine the association between pre-season training variables and subsequent in-season performance in an elite Australian football team. Data from forty-one elite male Australian footballers ( mean ± SD: age = 23.4 ± 3.1 y; height = 188.4 ± 7.1 cm; mass = 86.7 ± 7.9 kg) was collected from one Australian Football League ( AFL) club. Pre-season training data ( external load , internal load , fitness testing and session participation) were collected across the 17-week pre-season phase ( 6-weeks pre-Christmas , 11-weeks post-Christmas). Champion Data © Player Rank ( CDPR) , coaches ' ratings ( CR) and round one selection were used as in-season performance measures. CDPR and CR were examined over the entire season , first half of the season and the first four games. Both Pearson and partial ( controlling for AFL age) correlations were calculated to assess if any associations existed between pre-season training variables and in-season performance measures. A median-split was also employed to differentiate between higher and lower performing players for each performance measure. Pre-season training activities appeared to have almost no association with performance measured across the entire season and the first half of the season. However , many pre-season training variables were significantly linked with performance measured across the first four games. Pre-season training variables that were measured post-Christmas were the most strongly associated with in-season performance measures. Specifically , Total on-field session rating of perceived exertion ( sRPE) post-Xmas , a measurement of internal load , displayed the greatest association with performance. Late pre-season training ( especially on-field match specific training) is associated with better performance in the early season.
