  Implementing large arrays of gold nanowires as functional elements of a plasmonic biosensor is an important task for future medical diagnostic applications. Here we present a microfluidic-channel-integrated sensor for the label-free detection of biomolecules , relying on localized surface plasmon resonances. Large arrays ( âˆ¼ 1 cm
