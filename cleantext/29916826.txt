  A patient 's rights to informed consent and self-determination in psychiatric treatment are well enshrined , but the same rights have not yet been meaningfully extended to patients with regard to psychiatric diagnosis. Andrew Clark 's essay entitled `` Psychiatric Diagnoses and Informed Consent '' in The Journal of Clinical Ethics empowers both psychiatrists and patients to rethink who `` owns '' the process of clinical assessment and of bestowing diagnostic labels that may have far-reaching consequences. Clark 's article represents a noteworthy breakthrough in the field 's ongoing journey toward enhancing informed consent , personal dignity , and patients ' active involvement in their own care.
