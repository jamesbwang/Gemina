  To identify clinical variables associated with increased risk of composite adverse outcome in a cohort of women with puerperal group A streptococci infection. Our prospective case registry enrolled patients between 1991 and 2017. Chart abstraction was conducted for admission demographic and clinical data in patients with culture-proven puerperal group A streptococci infection. We created a composite variable of signs of capillary leakage including pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> , pleural effusion<symptom> , ascites , and abdominal<symptom> distention<symptom>. The composite adverse outcome included death , hysterectomy , intensive care unit admission , mechanical ventilation , and blood transfusion. Clinical characteristics were compared between those with a composite adverse outcome and those without. We fit unadjusted log-linear models with robust error variance to measure the relative risk of a composite adverse outcome associated with clinical and demographic variables among patients with group A streptococci. Thirty-five of 71 ( 49 %) patients had an adverse outcome. Women who had adverse outcomes had higher admission heart rates ( 126 ± 19 vs 112 ± 22 beats per minute , P = .008) and respiratory rates ( 26 ± 10 vs 20 ± 5 breaths per minute , P = .01) , lower systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( 98 ± 24 vs 114 ± 19 mm Hg , P = .004) , and were more likely to have signs of capillary leakage ( 77 % vs 20 % , P < .001) and symptoms of capillary leakage ( dyspnea<symptom> , cough<symptom> , shoulder pain , abdominal bloating , and chest<symptom> pain<symptom>) ( 40 % vs 17 % , P = .03) compared with those without adverse outcomes. Log-linear models indicated that these clinical variables were individually associated with increased risk of a composite adverse outcome. The relative risk of an adverse outcome was 3.5 times higher among women with signs of capillary leakage ( relative risk 3.67 , 95 % CI 1.94-6.94 , P < .001). Vital sign parameters consistent with severe infection correlate with adverse outcomes in women with puerperal group A streptococci infection. Signs of capillary leakage are most strongly associated with a composite adverse outcome. These clinical characteristics , particularly signs of capillary leakage , are potentially useful to guide clinical care.
