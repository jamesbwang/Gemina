  In this paper , we will present a reflection on reviewed literature on African indigenous understanding of spirituality , highlighting the influence of this concept on notions of the self , motivation and well-being. The indigenous understanding of spirituality is central to the understanding of the self as distinct , but positioned within the relational-collective self. This African indigenous perception of the self is grounded within the autonomous experience of the tenets of spirituality , which is explored in this paper through the lens of self-determination theory. The experience of autonomy , which is represented in this paper as choice and consent , competence and relatedness within spirituality , is considered as an intrinsic motivation factor for African indigenous communities to achieve well-being. Hence , we argue for the relevance of identifying and exploring ways that an understanding of the African indigenous spiritual belief systems , and the various ways that this understanding impacts on well-being for African indigenous communities , can be unearthed and scrutinized.
