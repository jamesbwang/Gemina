  Hot water epilepsy ( HWE) is a rare form of sensory epilepsy where seizures<symptom> are precipitated by a stimulus of contact with hot water. While earlier studies have suggested causal role of genes for HWE , specific underpinnings are beginning to be explored only recently. We carried out a whole genome-based linkage analysis in a family where most of its members affected by HWE and found evidence of a previously unknown locus at chromosome 9p24.3-p23. Parametric two-point analysis suggested linkage with the greatest LOD score of 3.42 for the marker D9S286 at 9p24 .1 at recombination fraction (
