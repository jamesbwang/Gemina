  The present study is aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of microRNA ( miRNA or miR) -503 on endothelial functions , as well as the mechanism by which high glucose leads to injury of endothelial cells. When reaching 80 % confluency , human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) were subjected to non-serum synchronization for 12 h , and medium of cells in high-glucose ( HG) group was replaced by normal medium supplemented with 25 mmol/L D-glucose. HUVECs cultured in normal glucose ( NG) medium<pathogen> were used as control. To overexpress miR-503 , HUVECs were transfected with miR-503 mimics. To silence insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R) mRNA , HUVECs were transfected with small interfering RNA ( siRNA). To predict whether miR-503 targets IGF-1R , bioinformatics was performed. Quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine miR-503 and IGF-1R mRNA expression , and Western blotting was employed to measure IGF-1R protein expression. Cell-Counting Kit 8 assay was used to determine HUVECs proliferation , while wound-healing assay was used to evaluate HUVECs migration. HUVECs apoptosis was investigated by measuring caspase 3 activity. Expression of IGF-1R in HUVECs in high glucose was decreased compared to that in normal glucose. miR-503 was predicted to target IGF-1R mRNA , and miR-503 expression in HUVECs in high glucose was higher than that in normal glucose. Overexpression of miR-503 inhibited the transcription and the translation of IGF-1R gene reducing migration , suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Transfection with IGF-1R siRNA decreased IGF-1R protein expression in HUVECs. Down-regulated IGF-1R expression reduced migration and proliferation , but promoted apoptosis of HUVECs. The present study demonstrates that miR-503 expression in HUVECs is elevated in high glucose condition. Also , miR-503 reduces migration and proliferation , but promotes apoptosis of HUVECs by inhibiting IGF-1R expression.
