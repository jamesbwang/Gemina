  Information regarding the effect of social determinants of health on heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) community-dwelling patients is scarce. We aimed to analyse the presence of socioeconomic inequalities , and their impact on hospitalisations and mortality , in patients with HF attended in a universal healthcare coverage system. A retrospective cohort study carried out in patients with HF aged > 40 and attended at the 53 primary healthcare centres of the Institut Catal√† de la Salut in Barcelona ( Spain). Socioeconomic status ( SES) was determined by an aggregated deprivation index ( MEDEA). Cox proportional hazard models and competing-risks regression based on Fine and Gray 's proportional subhazards were performed to analyse hospitalisations due to of HF and total mortality that occurred between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2012. Mean age was 78.1 years ( SD 10.2) and 56 % were women. Among the 8235 patients included , 19.4 % died during the 4 years of follow-up and 27.1 % were hospitalised due to HF. A gradient in the risk of hospitalisation was observed according to SES with the highest risk in the lowest socioeconomic group ( sHR 1.46 , 95 % CI 1.27 to 1.68). Nevertheless , overall mortality did not differ among the socioeconomic groups. In spite of finding a gradient that linked socioeconomic deprivation to an increased risk of hospitalisation , there were no differences in mortality regarding SES in a universal healthcare coverage system.
