  Polymyxins have been available since the 1960s , however , because of their adverse effects , their use has been reserved for the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant bacteria. The increase in the clinical experience acquired in recent years and the published medical literature have raised doubts about the information provided by the product , indicating the need to update dosage recommendations , pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic information ( PK/PD).

This procedure yielded a first report in 2014. This review highlights critical safety and efficacy aspects , reviews the recent pharmacokinetic and stability advances , the available pharmaceutical forms in Chile , providing the schemes currently recommended by health care agencies and experts in the field.
