  Congenital disorders of glycosylation are rare conditions caused by genetic defects in glycan synthesis , processing or transport. Most congenital disorders of glycosylation involve defects in the formation or transfer of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor of N-linked glycans. SLC35A2-CDG ( previously CDG-IIm) is caused by hemizygous or heterozygous mutations in the X-linked gene SLC35A2 that encodes a UDP-galactose transporter. To date there have only been 10 reported patients with SLC35A2 mutations. Importantly , the patient presented here was not identified in infancy by transferrin isoform analysis , the most common testing to identify patients with a congenital disorder of glycosylation. A 27 month old girl with developmental delay , central hypotonia , cerebral atrophy , and failure to thrive with growth retardation was identified by whole exome sequencing to have a mosaic missense variant in SLC35A2 ( c. 991G > A). This particular variant has been previously reported in a male as a mutation. Comparison of all clinical findings and new information on growth pattern , growth hormone testing and neurodevelopmental evaluation are detailed on the patient presented. This patient report increases the clinical and scientific knowledge of SLC35A2-CDG , a rare condition. New information on reduced growth , growth hormone sufficiency , lack of seizures<symptom> , and neurodevelopmental status are presented. This new information will be helpful to clinicians caring for individuals with SLC35A2-CDG. This report also alerts clinicians that transferrin isoform measurements do not identify all patients with congenital disorders of glycosylation.
