  Nitrogen is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and reproduction. In durum<pathogen> wheat , an appropriate nitrogen soil availability is essential for an optimal seed development. miRNAs contribute to the environmental change adaptation of plants through the regulation of important genes involved in stress processes. In this work , nitrogen stress response was evaluated in durum<pathogen> wheat seedlings of Ciccio and Svevo cultivars. Eight small RNA libraries from leaves and roots of chronically stressed plants were sequenced to detect conserved and novel miRNAs. A total of 294 miRNAs were identified , 7 of which were described here for the first time. The expression level of selected miRNAs and target genes was analyzed by qPCR in seedlings subjected to chronic ( Ciccio and Svevo , leaves and roots) or short-term ( Svevo roots) stress conditions. Some miRNAs showed an immediate stress response , and their level of expression was either maintained or returned to a basal level during a long-term stress. Other miRNAs showed a gradual up- or downregulation during the short-term stress. The newly identified miRNA ttu-novel-106 showed an immediate strongly downregulation after nitrogen stress , which was negatively correlated with the expression of MYB-A , its putative target gene. PHO2 gene was significantly upregulated after 24-48-h stress , corresponding to a downregulation of miR399b. Ttu-miR399b putative binding sites in the 5 ' UTR region of the Svevo PHO2 gene were identified in the A and B genomes. Both MYB-A and PHO2 genes were validated for their cleavage site using 5 ' RACE assay.
