  We used patient-specific neuronal cultures to characterize the molecular genetic mechanism of recessive nonsense mutations in neurofilament light ( Motor neurons were differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells of a patient with early-onset CMT carrying a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in We show that the recessive nonsense mutation causes a nearly total loss of The strict neuronal specificity of neurofilament has hindered the mechanistic studies of recessive
