  Decomposition of urea in aqueous solution was carried out using a microwave discharge electrodeless lamp ( MDEL) consisting of two photoreactors with a triple tube structure that generate vacuum-UV/UV light and reactive oxygen species ( ROS) using microwaves ( MW) as an energy source. The rate of decomposition of urea was highest under acidic conditions ( pH 4) compared with those at pH 7 and 10. When used in combination with dispersed TiO
