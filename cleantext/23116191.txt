  Theoretical quantum mechanical calculations have been carried out to establish the effect of surface vacancies on the adsorption of Pd and Pb atoms on the defective MgO ( 100) surface. The investigated defects included neutral , singly and doubly charged O and Mg vacancies on the ( 100) surface of MgO. These vacancies played the role of F None
