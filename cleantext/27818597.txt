  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) ranges from simple steatosis to NAFLD-related liver cirrhosis and is a main cause of chronic liver diseases. Patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and fibrosis<disease> are at a great risk of the progression to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma , both of which are tightly associated with liver-related mortality. Liver biopsy is still the gold standard for the diagnosis of NAFLD , but some defects , such as serious complications , sampling error and variability in histologic evaluation among pathologists , remain problematic. Therefore , noninvasive , repeatable and accurate diagnostic methods are urgently needed. Ultrasonography is a well-established and lower-cost imaging technique for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis , especially suitable for population census , but limited by its low sensitivity to diagnose mild steatosis and being highly operator-dependent. Computed tomography also lacks the sensitivity to detect mild steatosis and small changes in fat content , and presents a potential radiation hazard.
