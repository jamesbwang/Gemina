  The role of leukemia<disease> inhibitory factor receptor ( LIFR) , which is important in the signal transduction of the interleukin-6 cytokine family , is still undefined in clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC). Thus , we examined the function and mechanism of LIFR in ccRCC. Low LIFR expression correlated with a poor prognosis and an aggressive tumor phenotype. Moreover , integrated LIFR DNA and mRNA analysis revealed that promoter methylation and copy number variation contributed to the reduced LIFR expression. LIFR knockdown increased 786-O and Caki-2 cell invasion and migration. Notably , the Hippo pathway was highlighted as a potential downstream target of LIFR , where loss of LIFR inhibited the kinase activity of the pathway and increased the intracellular Yes-associated protein ( YAP) level. Conversely , YAP inhibition impaired the LIFR-silencing promotion of cell migration , invasion , and cancer stem cell marker expression. Moreover , drug sensitivity analysis and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database revealed that LIFR-deficient cells had high sensitivity to a YAP inhibitor and to two other anticancer drugs ( PHA-665752 , PF2341066). Our study revealed that LIFR attenuates tumor metastasis by suppressing YAP expression , suggesting that LIFR may serve as a potential target for ccRCC treatment.
