  Bifidobacterium<pathogen> is a diverse genus of anaerobic , saccharolytic bacteria that colonize many animals , notably humans and other mammals. The presence of these bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract represents a potential coevolution between the gut microbiome and its mammalian host mediated by diet. To study the relationship between bifidobacterial gut symbionts and host nutrition , we analyzed the genome of two bifidobacteria strains isolated from the feces of a common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus) , a primate species studied for its ability to subsist on host-indigestible carbohydrates. Whole genome sequencing identified these isolates as unique strains of Bifidobacterium<pathogen> callitrichos. All three strains , including these isolates and the previously described type strain , contain genes that may enable utilization of marmoset dietary substrates. These include genes predicted to contribute to galactose , arabinose , and trehalose metabolic pathways. In addition , significant genomic differences between strains suggest that bifidobacteria possess distinct roles in carbohydrate metabolism within the same host. Thus , bifidobacteria utilize dietary components specific to their host , both humans and non-human primates alike. Comparative genomics suggests conservation of possible coevolutionary relationships within the primate clade.
