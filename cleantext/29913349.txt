  High prevalence of sedentary behaviour is seen in most immigrant groups in Western countries , particularly in those from the Indian subcontinent. The primary objective of this study was to determine the sociocognitive associations with intention to undertake physical activity ( PA) among separate groups of Indian , Pakistani and Bangladeshi older adults aged â‰¥ 60 years in the North West of England , UK. Cross-sectional survey METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey , informed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour ( TPB) , 138 of 964 South Asian ( SA) older adults completed a mailed questionnaire that assessed self-reported PA and TPB variables. Associations were seen in beliefs about PA and the amount of PA undertaken ( rho = 0.18 , P = 0.04). Attitude was correlated with intention ( rho = 0.29 , P = 0.01) and amount of PA undertaken ( rho = 0.21 , P = 0.02). Subjective norm was correlated with intention to undertake PA ( rho = 0.21 , P = 0.02). Between-group differences were seen between ( 1) Indian and Pakistani group 's in subjective norm; ( 2) all ethnicities in intention to undertake PA; and ( 3) in the amount and attitude to undertaking PA between men and women. Comorbidity was associated with beliefs about PA uptake. Subgroup differences between Indian , Pakistani and Bangladeshi older adults in subjective norm and intention to undertaking PA highlight the importance of tailoring interventions to accommodate for subgroup differences when developing culturally appropriate PA interventions aimed at increasing uptake and adherence.
