  Soil , air , tree bark , rice , wheat , invertebrates , and chicken tissues around a typical endosulfan-contaminated site were analyzed in each season in each of two years. The total endosulfan ( the sum of α- , β-endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate) were significantly different in soil and air samples collected in the four seasons ( P < 0.01) and the mean concentrations were 6.53 ng/g dry weight ( d.w.) and 2.40 ng/m
