  In this research paper the production of biodiesel from palm kernel oil ( PKO) using CaO obtained from waste turkey bones ( WTB) and analytical grade calcium oxide was investigated. Treated WTB was reduced to fine particulate size of < 150 µm and then calcinated at 800 °C for 3 h to increase its catalytic activity by its conversion from Calcium phosphate hydroxide ( Ca
