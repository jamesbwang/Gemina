  There exists a paucity of research on the psychosocial risk factors of HIV/AIDS among men who have sex with men ( MSM) in settings where they are stigmatized or face prosecution. The present study investigates discrimination against people living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLHIV) , internalized homophobia , HIV/AIDS personal responsibility beliefs and HIV<pathogen> knowledge in a purposive sample of 106 self-identified MSM obtained through a web-based survey disseminated by two voluntary welfare organizations. Results indicate that internalized homophobia is positively associated with discrimination against PLHIV. Internalized homophobia also substantially mediates the effect of HIV/AIDS personal responsibility beliefs on discrimination against PLHIV , highlighting the confounded nature of HIV/AIDS and homosexual stigma in a setting where stigma is deep-rooted and institutionalized. Internalized homophobia may thus serve as a barrier to the effectiveness of HIV<pathogen> prevention efforts among MSM in Singapore.
