  Holothuria scabra is a sea cucumber that is mostly found in the Indo-Pacific region including Thailand. Extracts from many sea cucumbers possess pharmacological activities proposed to benefit human health. In this study , we investigated the anti-oxidant and anti-ageing activities of extracts from H. scabra by using Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> as a model organism. Parts of H. scabra were solvent-extracted and divided into nine fractions including whole body-hexane ( WBHE) , whole body-ethyl acetate ( WBEA) , whole body-butanol ( WBBU) , body wall-hexane ( BWHE) , body wall-ethyl acetate ( BWEA) , body wall-butanol ( BWBU) , viscera-hexane ( VIHE) , viscera-ethyl acetate ( VIEA) , and viscera-butanol ( VIBU). All fractions of the extracts were tested for anti-oxidant activities by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ( DPPH) and 2,2 '- azino-bis- ( 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) ( ABTS) assays and for anti-ageing effects by lifespan assays using C. elegans<pathogen> as a model. The results showed anti-oxidant properties in all fractions with the highest activity shown by the DPPH assay in WBBU ( EC
