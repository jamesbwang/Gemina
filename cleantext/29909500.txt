  A previous study confirmed that a novel splicing variant of large vascular endothelial growth factor ( L-VEGF) termed L-VEGF144 , a nucleolus protein , is found in glioblastoma cells and specimens , but the actual biological function and clinical significance of L-VEGF144 remain unclear. In this study , we analyzed the expression of L-VEGF144 in 68 glioblastoma multiforme specimens using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. The results showed that the high expression of L-VEGF144 was associated with a poor prognosis in the bevacizumab plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide treatment. In addition , we constructed a series truncated and mutant form of L-VEGF144 to confirm that exon 6a of L-VEGF144 is able to engage in the nuclear importation and found that 8 lysines within exon 6a play a critical role in the nucleolus aggregation of L-VEGF144. Also , the transfection of the L-VEGF144 increased the number of nucleoli. Furthermore , the recombinant protein Flag-L-VEGF144 and commercial VEGF protein have similar growth stimulatory activities in terms of inducing glioblastoma cell proliferation in vitro. Taken together , these results indicated that the expression of L-VEGF144 could potentially serve as an independent indicator of poor prognosis in bevacizumab treatment.
