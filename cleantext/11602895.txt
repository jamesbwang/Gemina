  Calciphylaxis is commonly associated with end-stage renal disease patients on haemodialysis. We present a rare case of calciphylaxis in a non-uremic patient. The diagnosis was made clinically and confirmed with skin biopsy showing calcification of the dermal and subcutaneous tissues in the von Kossa stain. We believe that the combination of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , a non-functioning paraganglioma and vitamin D deficiency in a susceptible female patient was responsible for causing calciphylaxis in our patient. An index of suspicion should be maintained by clinicians for calciphylaxis even in patients without uremia.
