  To compare images from early and delayed phases of contrast-enhanced thoracic CT for assessing pleural thickening or nodules<symptom> in a series of patients with malignant pleural effusions<symptom>. Blinded images from 36 patients with malignant pleural effusions<symptom> showing pleural lesions<symptom> in both early ( 35 s delayed) and delayed ( 70 s delayed) phases of thoracic and abdominal contrast-enhanced CT scan were retrospectively assessed by six observers. First , images were individually scored in a six-point scale grading the quality of visualization of pleural findings such as pleural thickening or nodules<symptom>. This was followed by a paired analysis , where the readers had to choose the one showing the highest quality between two images presented together corresponding to both phases of the same patient showing the same pleural lesion<symptom>. When possible , contrast attenuation of the abnormal pleura was measured. Statistical analysis was performed by using paired t-test and χ Mean attenuation of pleural lesions<symptom> was significantly higher in the delayed phase ( 76.0 ± 25.1 vs 57.5 ± 20.7 , p < 0.001). Mean score and score of individual images was statistically significant better for the delayed phase for all observers. In the paired analysis , all the readers preferred the delayed phase over the early phase in 77.8 to 91.7 % of the cases. Delayed phase of contrast-enhanced CT is preferable to early phase for evaluating pleural findings. Advances in knowledge: Pleural attenuation is greater for the delayed phase compared with the early phase of contrast-enhanced chest CT.. In the pairwise comparison , all the observers prefer the delayed phase over the early phase for pleural evaluation.
