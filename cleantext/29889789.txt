  To determine the association between radiographic cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) cap in the lateral internal auditory canal ( IAC) and likelihood of successful hearing preservation in middle cranial fossa ( MCF) vestibular schwannoma ( VS) surgery. Retrospective chart review. Academic tertiary referral center. One hundred thirty-eight consecutive patients ( mean age/standard deviation , SD , 50/11 yr) who underwent MCF VS resection. MCF VS excision. Size of fundal fluid cap on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) , pre- and postoperative pure-tone average ( PTA) , and word recognition score ( WRS). Mean tumor and fundal fluid sizes were 9.7 mm ( SD , 3.9 mm) and 2.8 mm ( SD , 1.7 mm) , respectively. On bivariate analysis , fundal fluid size was associated with larger tumor size ( p = 0.005) but not changes in postoperative PTA ( p = 0.45) or WRS ( p = 0.17). When fundal fluid size was stratified as none ( < 1 mm) , small ( ≥ 1 mm and < 4 mm) , and large ( ≥ 4 mm) , no significant differences were seen in rates of hearing preservation. Using multivariate linear regression models adjusting for patient age , sex , tumor nerve of origin , neurofibromatosis type II status , and preoperative PTA and WRS , superior vestibular nerve tumor origin but not increasing fundal fluid size was associated with preserved postoperative PTA or WRS. Presence or size of CSF fluid cap may not be a reliable prognostic indicator for hearing preservation in MCF VS resection , with important implications for patient counseling.
