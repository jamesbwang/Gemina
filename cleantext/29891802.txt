  With good high temperature and corrosive resistance performance , ceramic based composites can be used as promising materials to replace metal thermocouple materials. In this study , Si ₃ N ₄ ⁻ MoSi ₂ composites were prepared via hot pressing technology. X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , optical microscopy ( OM) , and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) were used to analyze the microstructure of the composites. The mechanical properties and electrical conductivity were tested. The results showed that the composites were composed of
