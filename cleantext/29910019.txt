  The epigenome editing framework provides an engineering approach to explore chromatin-based gene expression mechanisms. However , therapeutic utility of epigenetic editing-based systems has been lacking. A report in Cell ( Liu et. al. , 2018) shows that epigenetic editors can revert abnormal heterochromatin formation at the gene promoter leading to restoration of FMR1 gene expression , functionally rescuing fragile X syndrome<disease> ( FXS) , an otherwise unamenable genetic disorder.
