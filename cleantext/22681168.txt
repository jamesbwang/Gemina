  Undiagnosed depression<symptom> is an important comorbidity in type 2 diabetes ( T2D) which can be detected using the Geriatric Depression<symptom> Scale ( GDS-15) questionnaire. In this cross-sectional study , we examined the associations of depression<symptom> using GDS score with control of cardiometabolic risk factors and health status in elderly patients with T2D. Between February and December 2013 , patients aged ≥ 65 years who underwent structured comprehensive assessment as a quality improvement program at the Diabetes Center of a teaching hospital were invited to complete the GDS-15 questionnaire. Depression<symptom> was defined as a GDS score ≥ 7. Demographic data , prior history of co-morbidities , frequency of self-reported hypoglycemia , and attainment of treatment targets defined as HbA Among 325 participants ( 65 % male , median ( interquartile range) age: 69 ( 8) years) , 42 ( 13 %) had depression<symptom> Patients with depression<symptom> had longer disease durations ( mean ± SD: 15.1 ± 9.1 vs. 11.6 ± 8.1 years , In elderly patients with T2D , depression<symptom> was not uncommon especially in those with poor control of risk factors , hypoglycemia , and co-morbidities. Inclusion of GDS-15 questionnaire during structured assessment for complications and risk factors can identify these high-risk patients for more holistic management of their physical and mental health.
