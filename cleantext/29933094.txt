  This case describes a 16-year-old boy who suffered a severe traumatic brain injury. The patient gradually recovered but developed debilitating spasticity mainly in left triceps muscle , abnormal positioning of shoulder girdle complex , and shoulder pain. Phenol ( 6 %) was injected to axillary and radial nerves under guidance of electrical stimulation and ultrasound imaging at 10 weeks after initial injury. After injection , triceps spasticity and shoulder pain was immediately reduced and abnormal positions of shoulder girdle complex and elbow joint gradually returned to functional limits over 2 weeks. This case suggests that phenol neurolysis for spasticity management in early recovery could yield functional recovery.
