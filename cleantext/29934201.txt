  Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) is a highly prevalent condition in the context of the global obesity epidemic with significant medical comorbidities and psychosocial implications. The first-line treatment of OSA is continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP). There is evidence to demonstrate an association between nasal obstruction and OSA. Therefore , medications and surgical interventions to address nasal obstruction may play a role in the treatment of OSA. In addition , surgical correction of nasal obstruction has been shown to improve CPAP tolerance and compliance.
