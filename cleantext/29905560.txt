  Chromaffin cells of adrenal medulla have traditionally been considered as modified sympathetic neurons. However , the results of recent studies indicate the need to revise this concept. The article reviews recent findings in origin and ontogeny of adrenal chromaffin cells and transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of developmental processes. The article summarizes data on transcriptional control of chromaffin cells proliferation and maturation and participation of microRNA in regulation of chromaffin and sympathetic neuronal phenotype gene expression.
