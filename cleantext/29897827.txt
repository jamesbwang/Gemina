  To elucidate the metabolism of pazopanib , a metabolomics approach was performed based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole mass spectrometry. A total of 22 pazopanib metabolites were identified in vitro and in vivo. Among these metabolites , 17 were novel , including several cysteine adducts and aldehyde derivatives. By screening using recombinant CYPs , CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 were found to be the main forms involved in the pazopanib hydroxylation. Formation of a cysteine conjugate ( M3) , an aldehyde derivative ( M15) and two N-oxide metabolites ( M18 and M20) from pazopanib could induce the oxidative stress that may be responsible in part for pazopanib-induced hepatotoxicity. Morphological observation of the liver suggested that pazopanib ( 300 mg/kg) could cause liver injury. The aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase in serum significantly increased after pazopanib ( 150 , 300 mg/kg) treatment; this liver injury could be partially reversed by the broad-spectrum CYP inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole ( ABT). Metabolomics analysis revealed that pazopanib could significantly change the levels of L-carnitine , proline and lysophosphatidylcholine 18:1 in liver. Additionally , drug metabolism-related gene expression analysis revealed that hepatic Cyp2d22 and Abcb1a ( P-gp) mRNAs were significantly lowered by pazopanib treatment. In conclusion , this study provides a global view of pazopanib metabolism and clues to its influence on hepatic function.
