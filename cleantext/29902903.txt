  The study aims to analyze the mechanisms of Hirudo in promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis based on network pharmacology. A database of chemical components of Hirudo was established through literature retrieval. The targets were predicted by using the reverse pharmacophore matching method and screened according to the antithrombotic and anticoagulant drug targets approved by FDA in the DrugBank database. Then , the targets were analyzed by KEGG pathway analysis , the protein interactions were analyzed by using BioGrid database , and the active constituents-target-pathway network model of Hirudo was established to study the mechanisms of Hirudo in promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. This study collected 49 chemical components of Hirudo , including amino acid , polypeptide , fatty acid ester , alkaloid , glycosides , and steroid. Totally 376 targets were predicted , and 5 critical targets related to the effects of Hirudo in promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis were screened , including fibrinogen gamma chain , plasminogen , prothrombin , Urokinase-type plasminogen activator and coagulation factor X. The potential regulatory pathways included complement and coagulation cascades , platelet activation , VEGF signaling pathway , focal adhesion. This study reflects the multi-component , multi-target and multi-pathway features of Hirudo , and provides a scientific basis for elucidating the mechanisms of action of Hirudo in promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis , as well as a reference for the study of mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine.
