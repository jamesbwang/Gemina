  Intelligent tutor systems ( ITSs) in mobile devices take us through learning tasks and make learning ubiquitous , autonomous , and at low cost ( Nye , 2015). In this paper , we describe guided embodiment as an ITS essential feature for second language learning ( L2) and aphasia<symptom> rehabilitation ( ARe) that enhances efficiency in the learning process. In embodiment , cognitive processes , here specifically language ( re) learning are grounded in actions and gestures ( Pecher and Zwaan , 2005; Fischer and Zwaan , 2008; Dijkstra and Post , 2015). In order to guide users through embodiment , ITSs must track action and gesture , and give corrective feed-back to achieve the users ' goals. Therefore , sensor systems are essential to guided embodiment. In the next sections , we describe sensor systems that can be implemented in ITS for guided embodiment.
