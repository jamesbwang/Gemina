  To gain information about the advantages/disadvantages of an implementation of patient-reported outcome measures ( PROM) into the clinical routine of trauma/orthopaedic surgeons , and to identify the technical constraints confronting a successful implementation of PROMs. Online survey. Surgeons who are members of the AO Foundation. Participants answered questions regarding demographics , their familiarity with specific and generic PROMs and the use of PROMs in clinical routine. Furthermore , reasons for/against using PROMs , why not used more often , prerequisites to implement PROMs into clinical routine and whether PROMs would be implemented if adequate tools/technologies were available , were solicited. Χ 1212 surgeons completed the survey ( response rate: 6.8 %; margin of error: ± 2.72 %): 54.2 % were trauma/orthopaedic surgeons , 16.6 % were spine surgeons , 27.9 % were craniomaxillofacial surgeons and 16 had no defined specialty. Working in a certain AO Region , surgical specialisation and current workplace were associated with a higher familiarity of disease-specific PROMs and the use of PROMs in daily clinical routine ( p ≤ 0.05). Exploratory factor analysis identified four categories important for the use of PROMs and two categories preventing the use of PROMs. In case of the availability of an adequate tool , 66.2 % of surgeons would implement PROMs in clinical routine. Our survey results provide an understanding of the use of PROMs in clinical routine. There is consensus on the usefulness of PROMs. User-friendly and efficient tools/technologies would be a prerequisite for the daily use of PROMs. Additionally , educational efforts and/or policies might help.
