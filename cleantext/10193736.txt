  Biventricular pacing has been shown to increase both cardiac contractility and coronary flow acutely but the causal relationship is unclear. We hypothesised that changes in coronary flow are secondary to changes in cardiac contractility. We sought to examine this relationship by modulating coronary flow and cardiac contractility. Contractility and lusitropy were altered by varying the location of pacing in 8 patients. Coronary autoregulation was transiently disabled with intracoronary adenosine. Simultaneous coronary flow velocity , coronary pressure and left ventricular pressure data were measured in the different pacing settings with and without hyperaemia and wave intensity analysis performed. Multisite pacing was effective at altering left ventricular contractility and lusitropy ( pos. dp/dt Acutely increasing coronary flow with adenosine in patients with systolic heart<symptom> failure<symptom> does not increase contractility. Changes in coronary flow with biventricular pacing are likely to be a consequence of enhanced cardiac contractility from resynchronization and not vice versa.
