  Nearly half of US births are financed by Medicaid , and one-third of births occur by cesarean delivery , at double the cost of vaginal delivery. With the goal of reducing unnecessary cesarean use and improving value , in 2009 Minnesota 's Medicaid program introduced a blended payment rate for uncomplicated births ( ie , a single facility or professional services payment regardless of delivery mode). We evaluated the effect of the blended payment policy on cesarean use and costs for Medicaid fee-for-service births. We identified births in Medicaid Analytic Extract files from 3 years before and after the 2009 payment change in Minnesota and in 6 control states. We used a quarterly interrupted time series approach to assess policy-related changes in study outcomes , comparing Minnesota to control states. Outcomes included cesarean delivery , childbirth hospitalization costs , and maternal morbidity. Minnesota 's prepolicy cesarean rate ( 22.8 %) decreased 0.27 percentage points per quarter after the policy for a total decrease of 3.24 percentage points , compared with control states ( P = 0.01). The cost of childbirth hospitalizations in Minnesota dropped by $ 425.80 at the time of the policy. Postpolicy , childbirth hospitalization costs continued to decrease in Minnesota relative to prepolicy by $ 95.04 per quarter , and declined more than control states ( P < 0.001). There were no significant policy effects on maternal morbidity. Implementation of a single , blended payment to facilities and clinicians for uncomplicated births mitigated trends toward greater use of cesarean and rising costs of childbirth hospitalization , without adverse effects on maternal morbidity.
