  The pore structure of alkali-activated slag has a significant influence on its performance. However , the literature shows insufficient studies regarding the suitability of different techniques for characterizing the pore structure and the influences of Na ₂ O and curing age on pore structure development. In pursuit of a better understanding , the pore structure of sodium hydroxide activated slag paste was characterized by multiple techniques , e.g. , mercury intrusion porosimetry ( MIP) , nitrogen ( N ₂) adsorption , and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) image analysis. The sodium hydroxide activated slag pastes were prepared with three different contents of Na ₂ O ( Na ₂ O/slag = 4 , 6 , and 8 %) and cured for different times up to 360 days. The microstructure observation reveals that outer C ⁻ ( N ⁻) A ⁻ S ⁻ H and inner C ⁻ ( N ⁻) A ⁻ S ⁻ H grow successively around the reacting slag grains , along with crystalline reaction products which are formed in the empty coarse pore space. The increase of Na ₂ O content and curing age lead to a finer pore structure. The MIP measurements show that the total porosity drops about 70 % within the first day , and that one peak at most , corresponding to gel pores , was identified in the differential curves of all the investigated samples from 1 to 360 days. On the contrary , only one peak , corresponding to capillary pores , was identified by SEM-image analysis. The differential curves derived from N ₂ adsorption generally reveal two peaks , and the trend that the pore diameters of those two peaks vary with curing age depends on the content of Na ₂ O. Compared to Portland cement , sodium hydroxide activated slag has a higher pore space filling capacity (
