  The ability to direct targeted intercellular interactions has the potential to enable and expand the use of cell-based therapies for regenerative medicine , tissue engineering , and immunotherapy. While genetic engineering approaches have proven effective , these techniques are not amenable to all cell types and often yield permanent modifications with potentially long-lasting adverse effects , restricting their application. To circumvent these limitations , there is intense interest in developing non-genetic methods to modify cell membranes<symptom> with functional groups that will enable the recognition of target cells. While many such techniques have been developed , relatively few have been applied to directing specific cell-cell interactions. This review details these non-genetic membrane engineering approaches-namely , hydrophobic membrane insertion , chemical modification , liposome fusion , metabolic engineering , and enzymatic remodeling-and summarizes their major applications. Based on this analysis , perspective is provided on the ideal features of these systems with an emphasis on the potential for clinical translation.
