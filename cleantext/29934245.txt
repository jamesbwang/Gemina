  With the help of Surflex-Dock calculation , two ritonavir analogs in which one thioazole unit was replaced by selenazole have been designed and synthesized. The key selenazole structure was constructed from Î²-azido diselenide through a cascade diselenide cleavage/selenocarbonylation/Staudinger reduction/aza-Wittig reaction and a following MnO
