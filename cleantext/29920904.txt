  The efficient , 12-14 step ( LLS) total synthesis of (-)- halenaquinone has been achieved. Key steps in the synthetic sequence include: ( a) proline sulfonamide-catalyzed , Yamada-Otani reaction to establish the C6 all-carbon quaternary stereocenter , ( b) multiple , novel palladium-mediated oxidative cyclizations to introduce the furan moiety , and ( c) oxidative Bergman cyclization to form the final quinone ring.
