  Historical factors , demography , reproduction and dispersal are crucial in determining the genetic structure of seabirds. In the Antarctic marine environment , penguins are a major component of the avian biomass , dominant predators and important bioindicators of ecological change. Populations of chinstrap penguins have decreased in nearly all their breeding sites , and their range is expanding throughout the Antarctic Peninsula. Population genetic structure of this species has been studied in some colonies , but not between breeding colonies in the Antarctic Peninsula or at the species ' easternmost breeding colony ( Bouvetøya). Connectivity , sex-biased dispersal , diversity , genetic structure and demographic history were studied using 12 microsatellite loci and a mitochondrial DNA region ( HVRI) in 12 breeding colonies in the South Shetland Islands ( SSI) and the Western Antarctic Peninsula ( WAP) , and one previously unstudied sub-Antarctic island<disease> , 3600 km away from the WAP ( Bouvetøya). High genetic diversity , evidence of female bias-dispersal and a sign of population expansion after the last glacial maximum around 10,000 mya were detected. Limited population genetic structure and lack of isolation by distance throughout the region were found , along with no differentiation between the WAP and Bouvetøya ( overall microsatellite F The subtle differentiation found may be explained by some combination of low natal philopatric behavior , high rates of dispersal and/or generally high mobility among colonies of chinstrap penguins compared to other Pygoscelis species.
