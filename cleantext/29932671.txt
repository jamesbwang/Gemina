  Cerium oxide ( IV) nanoparticles offer a high redox ability , while maintaining nontoxicity and high stability. Thus , dispersed nanoceria is a promising candidate as antioxidant material for human cells. In this work , we report on a fast and simple one-pot process that yield a final nanoparticle size of 2-4 nm in polar solvents such as water and alcohols. High boiling point solvents , namely , benzyl alcohol and triethylene glycol , are used to obtain high crystalline nanoparticles by thermal and microwave activation. Transmission electron microscopy investigations prove the narrow size distribution of the CeO
