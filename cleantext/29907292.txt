  CD38 is a surface membrane antigen highly expressed in malignant blood cells , such as multiple myeloma ( MM). A soluble form of CD38 ( sCD38) is also present in the plasma , deriving likely from the shedding from the cells. The plasma levels of sCD38 should thus correlate closely with the proliferation of the MM cells , allowing the development of a simple diagnostic blood test for monitoring the progress of the disease. However , the plasma sCD38 levels are extremely low , requiring the design of a highly sensitive and specific assay. In this study , we developed an ultra-sensitive assay , based on two nanobodies ( Nbs) targeting two distinct epitopes of sCD38. One Nb acts as a capturer , and the other is fused with the firefly luciferase serving as a reporter to ensure sensitivity. We showed that this Dual epitopes protein IDentification ( DepID) assay has sensitivity reaching 10 pg/mL , which is 10 times higher than that of a commercial ELISA kit. By this method , we were able to precisely quantify the levels of sCD38 in the plasma of MM patients , which were significantly higher than those from healthy donors. We further showed that the increase plasma levels of sCD38 correlated with the progress of MM. We have developed a Nb-based luminescence sandwich assay , named as DepID , for quantification of the soluble CD38 in MM patients ' plasma and showed the potency of this method as a tool for general diagnosis of MM or companion diagnosis of the CD38-targeted therapies.
