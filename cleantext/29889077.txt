  Huntingtin ( HTT) is a scaffold protein mostly known because it gives rise to the severe and incurable inherited neurological disorder Huntington 's disease ( HD) when mutated. The Huntingtin gene ( HTT) carries a polymorphic trinucleotide expansion of CAGs in exon 1 that ranges from 9 to 35 in the non-HD affected population. However , if it exceeds 35 CAG repeats , the altered protein is referred to as mutant HTT and leads to the development of HD. Given the wide spectrum of severe<symptom> symptoms<symptom> developed by HD individuals , wild-type and mutant HTT have been mostly studied in the context of this disorder. However , HTT expression is ubiquitous and several peripheral<symptom> symptoms<symptom> in HD have been described , suggesting that HTT is of importance , not only in the central nervous system ( CNS) , but also in peripheral organs. Accordingly , HTT and mutant HTT may interfere with non-brain-related diseases. Correlative studies have highlighted a decreased cancer incidence in the HD population and both wild-type and mutant HTT have been implicated in tumor progression. In this review , we describe the current evidence linking wild-type and mutant HTT to cancer and discuss how CAG polymorphism , HTT function , and partners may influence carcinogenesis and metastatic progression.
