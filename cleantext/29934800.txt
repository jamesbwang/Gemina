  Predictors of outcomes in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved left-ventricular ejection fraction ( HFpEF) remain unclear. The ratio of early diastolic transmitral flow velocity to early diastolic myocardial velocity ( E/e ') has been proposed , but the predictive accuracy remains unsatisfactory. We hypothesized that E/e ' normalized by the stroke volume ( SV) , E/e '/ SV , could be a good predictor of outcome in HFpEF patients by reflecting the terminal slope of the end-diastolic pressure-volume relation , i.e. , stiffness of the left ventricle. This pilot study was conducted to propose a novel echocardiographic index for predicting the outcomes of patients with HFpEF. Echocardiography including E/e '/ SV measurement was performed in consecutive 80 HFpEF patients at discharge in index hospitalization due to HF. The end points included the readmission for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and cardiovascular death at 1 year after discharge. 19 patients ( 24 %) met the end points. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed that E/e ''/ SV was a strong predictive factor ( AUC = 0.78) compared to E/e ' ( AUC = 0.74). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with E/e '/ SV > 0.40 had a poorer prognosis than those with E/e '/ SV < 0.40 ( p < 0.01). By Cox regression multi-variate analysis , a high E/e '/ SV was an independent predictor of event-free survival ( adjusted hazard ratio ( 95 % CI) 14.26 ( 3.18 , 63.93) ( p = 0.01)). E/e '/ SV has potential to predict clinical outcomes in patients with HFpEF.
