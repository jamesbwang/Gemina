  National performance measurement needs clinical data that track the performance of multi disciplinary teams across episodes of care. Clinical registries are ideal platforms for this work due to their capture of structured , specific data across specialties. Because registries collect data at a national level , and registry data are captured in a consistent structure and format within each registry , registry data are useful for measurement and analysis `` out of the box ''. Registry business models are hampered by the cost of collecting data from EHRs and other source systems and abstracting or mapping them to fit registry data models. The National Quality Registry Network ( NQRN) has launched Registries on FHIR , an initiative to lower barriers to achieving semantic interoperability between registries and source data systems. In 2017 Registries on FHIR conducted an information gathering campaign to learn where registries want better interoperability , and how to go about improving it.
