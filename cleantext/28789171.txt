  We present a new technique allowing the fabrication of large modal count photonic lanterns for space-division multiplexing applications. We demonstrate mode-selective photonic lanterns supporting 10 and 15 spatial channels by using graded-index fibres and microstructured templates. These templates are a versatile approach to position the graded-index fibres in the required geometry for efficient mode sampling and conversion. Thus , providing an effective scalable method for large number of spatial modes in a repeatable manner. Further , we demonstrate the efficiency and functionality of our photonic lanterns for optical communications. Our results show low insertion and mode dependent losses , as well as enhanced mode selectivity when spliced to few mode transmission fibres. These photonic lantern mode multiplexers are an enabling technology for future ultra-high capacity optical transmission systems.
