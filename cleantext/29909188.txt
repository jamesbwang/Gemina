  Phenylketonuria ( PKU) is a prevalent inherited metabolic disorder caused by a phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH) or tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4) deficiency , which leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine ( PHE). High blood levels of PHE have a toxic effect on the brain and are associated with several neurological signs. Most cases of PKU are identified during infancy , and diagnosis of PKU in adult is rare. Here , we describe a 29-year-old patient with progressive dementia and muscular weakness<symptom> mimicking X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Haematological tests revealed high PHE levels ( 966.67 μmol/ L , normal 20.00-120.00 μmol/L) and his gene test showed compound heterozygosity for c. 740 G > T and c. 728 G > A of PAH gene mutations , suggesting a diagnosis of PKU. His condition had controlled partly but not significantly improved with appropriate treatment. Our patient is the first case of late-diagnosed PKU with definite heterozygous PAH gene mutations reported in China albeit he had milder symptoms than the previous reported cases around world. Although late-diagnosed PKU is rare , this diagnosis should be considered for patients presenting with leukoencephalopathy accompanied by common neurological signs.
