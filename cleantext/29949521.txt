  Respiratory motion during cardiac PET acquisitions can cause image blurring and erroneous uptake quantification. In particular the misalignment of attenuation correction ( AC) maps and PET emission data can lead to severe quantification errors , because the AC value of the heart is five times higher than of the surrounding lung tissue. Standard PET-MR approaches assume accurate alignment between breathhold MR-based AC maps and free-breathing PET emission data but can not necessarily ensure it. Here we propose a 75 s free-breathing MR-acquisition , which provides respiratory-resolved AC maps ( AC
