  In this study , coupling of ultrasound ( US) device and rotor-stator ( RS) , operating at low-energy densities , was studied as an alternative process to individual US and RS to produce modified starch-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions , as well as its potential use to encapsulate eugenol. To this aim , a full factorial design was employed to evaluate the effects of the US nominal power ( 0 , 360 and 720 W) and RS nominal power ( 0 , 150 and 300 W) on the physical properties , encapsulation efficiency and kinetic stability of emulsions produced. Firstly , the action of modified starch and eugenol onto interface oil-water was evaluated. The emulsifier was rapidly adsorbed on the interface water-sunflower oil reducing the interfacial tension from 25 to 16 mN/m , while eugenol did not show surface activity. The increase of energy density , in general , resulted in droplet size reduction , indicating the relevant role of the forces involved in the droplet breakup on emulsion stability. Coupling was more efficient on the droplets breakup producing smaller droplet size with narrower size distribution. While the coupled system work during 5 min for an energy density of 583 J/mL , the corresponding emulsification time for operating singly US and RS were 7.09 min and 17.04 min , respectively. Therefore , the main advantage associate to coupled process is the reduction of processing time to produce an emulsion with better kinetic stability.
