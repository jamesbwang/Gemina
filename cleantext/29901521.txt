  Elevated levels of serum prolactin and a high expression of prolactin receptor ( PRLR) in cancer cells was recently identified in patients with endometrial cancer ( EC). However , the impact of prolactin on EC remains unknown. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical and immunohistochemical characteristics of hyperprolactinemic patients with EC according to the pathogenetic types , type I and type II. EC patients were retrospectively divided into a high prolactin ( HP) group and a low prolactin ( LP) group by a serum prolactin level of 20 ng/mL and were compared between 2 groups. The expression of PRLR , phosphorylated Janus-kinase 2 ( pJAK2) , estrogen receptor-Î± , progesterone receptor , and PTEN in cancer tissue were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Ninety-nine patients were identified. In the type I group , HP group was significantly younger ( 45.2 vs. 52.2 , P = 0.028) and their insulin resistance was significantly lower ( 1.6 vs. 2.5 , P = 0.033) than those in LP group , and the expression of PRLR and pJAK2 in the HP group was significantly higher than that in the LP group ( immunoreactive score: 6.8 vs. 3.9 , P = 0.003; 5.7 vs. 2.6 , P < 0.001 , respectively). In the type 2 group , there were no differences between all the term. In the type I group , the rate of loss of PTEN in the HP group was significantly lower than the LP group ( 25.0 % vs. 60.7 % , P = 0.024). Prolactin-PRLR signaling may play a crucial role for the progression of type I EC without involving the PTEN mutation in young hyperprolactinemic women without insulin resistance.
