  To integrate electronic clinical decision support tools into clinical practice and to evaluate the impact on indwelling urinary catheter ( IUC) use and catheter-associated urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( CAUTIs). Design , Setting , and ParticipantsThis 4-phase observational study included all inpatients at a multicampus , academic medical center between 2011 and 2015. InterventionsPhase 1 comprised best practices training and standardization of electronic documentation. Phase 2 comprised real-time electronic tracking of IUC duration. In phase 3 , a triggered alert reminded clinicians of IUC duration. In phase 4 , a new IUC order ( 1) introduced automated order expiration and ( 2) required consideration of alternatives and selection of an appropriate indication. Overall , 2,121 CAUTIs , 179,070 new catheters , 643,055 catheter days , and 2,186 reinsertions occurred in 3 · 85 million hospitalized patient days during the study period. The CAUTI rate per 10,000 patient days decreased incrementally in each phase from 9 · 06 in phase 1 to 1 · 65 in phase 4 ( relative risk ( RR) , 0 · 182; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0 · 153-0 · 216; P < · 001). New catheters per 1,000 patient days declined from 53 · 4 in phase 1 to 39 · 5 in phase 4 ( RR , 0 · 740; 95 % CI , 0 · 730; P < · 001) , and catheter days per 1,000 patient days decreased from 194 · 5 in phase 1 to 140 · 7 in phase 4 ( RR , 0 · 723; 95 % CI , 0 · 719-0 · 728; P < · 001). The reinsertion rate declined from 3 · 66 % in phase 1 to 3 · 25 % in phase 4 ( RR , 0 · 894; 95 % CI , 0 · 834-0 · 959; P = · 0017). The phased introduction of decision support tools was associated with progressive declines in new catheters , total catheter days , and CAUTIs. Clinical decision support tools offer a viable and scalable intervention to target hospital-wide IUC use and hold promise for other quality improvement initiatives.
