  The degree of fermionic entanglement is examined in an exactly solvable Ising-Hubbard ladder , which involves interacting electrons on the ladder 's rungs described by Hubbard dimers at half-filling on each rung , accounting for intrarung hopping and Coulomb terms. The coupling between neighboring Hubbard dimers is assumed to have an Ising-like nature. The ground-state phase diagram consists of four distinct regions corresponding to the saturated paramagnetic , the classical antiferromagnetic , the quantum antiferromagnetic , and the mixed classical-quantum phase. We have exactly computed the fermionic concurrence , which measures the degree of quantum entanglement between the pair of electrons on the ladder rungs. The effects of the hopping amplitude , the Coulomb term , temperature , and magnetic fields on the fermionic entanglement are explored in detail. It is shown that the fermionic concurrence displays a re-entrant behavior when quantum entanglement is being generated at moderate temperatures above the classical saturated paramagnetic ground state.
