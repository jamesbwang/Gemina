  Pectate lyase catalyses the eliminative cleavage of de-esterified pectin , which is a major component of primary cell walls in many higher plants. Pectate lyase-like ( PLL) genes have been identified in various plant species and are involved in a broad range of physiological processes associated with pectin degradation. Previous studies have functionally identified two PLL genes in rice ( Oryza sativa. L). However , the knowledge concerning genome-wide analysis of this family remains limited , and functions of the other PLL genes have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study , we identified 12 PLL genes based on a genome-wide investigation in rice. A complete overview of this gene family is presented , including chromosomal locations , exon-intron structure , cis-acting elements and conserved motifs. PLL protein sequences from multiple plant species were compared and divided into five groups based on phylogenetic analysis. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that only a portion of OsPLL genes ( 4 of 12) exhibits detectable expression levels. Notably , OsPLL1 , OsPLL3 , OsPLL4 and OsPLL12 exhibit strong and preferential expression in panicles suggesting that the potential roles of these genes are crucial during rice panicle development. Moreover , knockdown of OsPLL3 and OsPLL4 by artificial microRNA ( amiRNA) disrupted normal pollen development and resulted in partial male sterility. These results could provide valuable information for characterising the functions and dissecting the molecular mechanisms of the OsPLL genes.
