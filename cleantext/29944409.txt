  Preliminary diagnosis of clinical symptoms and gross lesions<symptom> with subsequent histopathologic and PCR analyses revealed histomoniasis in 276 chicken flocks in Jiangsu Province , China , and surrounding areas from January 2012 to December 2015. Detailed statistical analysis was performed to explore the occurrence and epidemic characteristics of histomoniasis in chicken flocks. The results indicated that histomoniasis usually occurred in free-range flocks of local broilers and laying hens. Also , 2- to 3-mo-old chickens were most susceptible to infection , and adult chickens rarely developed infection. The morbidity rate of chickens was generally 10 % -30 % , with mortality rates of less than 10 %. Moreover , histomoniasis is a seasonal disease , occurring most often from April to June , and the rate of coinfection with heterakids in the ceca of infected chicken was 50.8 %. The symptoms of diseased chickens included mental<symptom> fatigue<symptom> , bowing of the head and wings , and yellowish green droppings , with bloody<symptom> stool<symptom> in very limited cases. Most of the pathologic changes were characteristic of the disease , but there were also some atypical lesions<symptom> confirmed by laboratory techniques. In the current study , the histomoniasis epidemic was first investigated in Chinese chicken flocks , and the results provided a useful reference for further study of this disease.
