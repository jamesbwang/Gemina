  Hepatocytes exhibit diverse reactions upon stimulation with the interleukin IL-6 , mainly in the context of inflammation<symptom> and energy metabolism. Melatonin has been shown to exert pleiotropic protective actions , such as anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress on many cell- and organ-types. The key role of the liver to maintain homeostasis and metabolic regulation prompted us to evaluate the direct modification of IL-6-induced alterations in HepG2 cells in a chip by melatonin. IL-6 administration was followed by the reduced expression and activity of MRP2 , a loss of CYP1A activity , and the decline of PXR expression. Other effects were the induction of acute phase responses ( reduced albumin production as well as increased CRP and hepcidin expression) and lowered expression of CREB3L3. IL-6 affected also the mitochondrial membrane potential together with elevated mitochondrial superoxide generation , and glycogen deposition was reduced. Melatonin counteracted all observed IL-6-induced alterations except the rise in CRP release and CYP1A activity. Altogether , this new in vitro model can be applied to investigate hepatic inflammatory responses stimulated by IL-6 , and these results indicate that hepatocellular inflammatory responses to IL-6 are mitigated by melatonin.
