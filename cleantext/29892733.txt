  Syntheses of novel semi-orthogonally protected CycloTriVeratrilene ( CTV) analogues with enhanced water solubility , that is 3 and 4 , derived from the previously described CTV scaffold derivative 2 are described here. These scaffolds 2-4 enabled a sequential introduction of three different complementarity determining region ( CDR) mimics via Cu ( i)- catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition towards medium-sized protein mimics denoted as `` synthetic antibodies ''. The highly optimised sequential introduction enabled selective attachment of three different CDR mimics in a one-pot fashion. This approach of obtaining synthetic antibodies , demonstrated by the synthesis of paratope mimics of monoclonal antibody infliximab ( Remicade Â®) , provided a facile access to a range of ( highly) pre-organised molecules bearing three different ( cyclic) peptide segments and may find a wide range of applications in the field of protein-protein interaction disruptors as well as in the development of synthetic vaccines or lectin mimics. The prepared synthetic antibodies were tested for their affinity towards tumour necrosis<symptom> factor alpha using surface plasmon resonance and synthetic antibodies with micromolar affinities were uncovered.
