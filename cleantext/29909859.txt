  During the past few years , there has been a surge in the use of catheter-directed thrombolysis ( CDT) for acute pulmonary embolism ( PE) , in the form of either standard CDT or ultrasound-assisted CDT ( usCDT). This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published series on contemporary CDT for acute PE seeking to determine their clinical efficacy , stratifying by PE severity and CDT modality. A comprehensive MEDLINE and Embase search was performed to identify studies that reported outcomes of CDT for acute PE published from 2009 to July 2017. Outcomes included clinical success ( in-hospital survival with stabilization of hemodynamics , without decompensation or any major complication) , in-hospital mortality , major bleeding , right ventricular/left ventricular ratio , and Miller score changes after CDT. Meta-analyses assumed random effects. Twenty studies with 1168 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Available for subgroup analysis were 210 patients with high-risk PE and 945 patients with intermediate-risk PE; 181 patients received CDT using a standard multiside hole catheter , and 850 received usCDT. The pooled average right ventricular/left ventricular improvement and Miller score drop after CDT were 0.30 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.22-0.39) and 8.8 ( 95 % CI , 7.1-10.5). For high-risk PE , the pooled estimate for clinical success was 81.3 % ( 95 % CI , 72.5 % -89.1 %) , the 30-day mortality estimate was 8.0 % ( 95 % CI , 3.2 % -14.0 %) , and major bleeding was 6.7 % ( 95 % CI , 1.0 % -15.3 %). For intermediate-risk PE , the pooled estimate for clinical success was 97.5 % ( 95 % CI , 95.3 % -99.1 %) , the 30-day mortality was 0 % ( 95 % CI , 0 % -0.5 %) , and major bleeding was 1.4 % ( 95 % CI , 0.3 % -2.8 %). In high-risk PE , clinical success for CDT and usCDT was 70.8 % ( 95 % CI , 53.4 % -85.8 %) and 83.1 % ( 95 % CI , 68.5 % -94.5 %) , respectively. In intermediate-risk PE , clinical success for CDT and usCDT was 95.0 % ( 95 % CI , 88.5 % -99.2 %) and 97.5 % ( 95 % CI , 95.0 % -99.4 %) , respectively. Catheter thrombolysis has high clinical success rates in both high- and intermediate-risk PE , but higher mortality and bleeding rates should be anticipated in high-risk PE. Ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis may be more effective than standard CDT in the higher risk population.
