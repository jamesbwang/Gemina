  Even in the 21st century , dental<disease> caries<disease> is considered a global burden , severely upsetting the health and quality of life of those affected. Apart from the usage of fluoride and regular oral hygiene , one of the most important prophylactic approaches against the occurrence of caries<disease> is the sealing of pits and fissures. However , the rapid progress of new materials and applications for sealing pits and fissures also raises new questions about their correct application. Recent literature on pit and fissure sealing , caries<disease> prevention , as well as caries<disease> risk assessment for both children and adults was reviewed. This report provides a general overview of pit and fissure sealing , the materials used for sealing occlusal surfaces , as well as indications and possible side effects. The conclusions are that sealing pit and fissures of primary and permanent teeth is an effective method for preventing and arresting caries<disease>. However , regular checkups must be conducted to avoid advanced tooth decay attributable to leakages in the sealing.
