  Intervertebral kinematic assessments have been used to investigate mechanical causes when back pain is resistant to treatment , and recent studies have identified intervertebral motion markers that discriminate patients from controls. However , such patients are a heterogeneous group , some of whom have structural disruption , but the effects of this on intervertebral kinematics are unknown. Thirty-seven patients with treatment-resistant back<symptom> pain<symptom> referred for quantitative fluoroscopy were matched to an equal number of pain-free controls for age and sex. All received passive recumbent flexion assessments for intervertebral motion sharing inequality ( MSI) , variability ( MSV) , laxity and translation. Comparisons were made between patient subgroups , between patients and controls and against normative levels from a separate group of controls. Eleven patients had had surgical or interventional procedures , and ten had spondylolisthesis or pars defects. Sixteen had no disruption. Patients had significantly higher median MSI values ( 0.30) than controls ( 0.27 , p = 0.010) , but not MSV ( patients 0.08 vs controls 0.08 , p = 0.791). Patients who received invasive procedures had higher median MSI values ( 0.37) than those with bony defects ( 0.30 , p = 0.018) or no disruption ( 0.28 , p = 0.0007). Laxity and translation above reference limits were not more prevalent in patients. Patients with treatment-resistant nonspecific back<symptom> pain<symptom> have greater MSI values than controls , especially if the former have received spinal surgery. However , excessive laxity , translation and MSV are not more prevalent in these patients. Thus , MSI should be investigated as a pain mechanism and for its possible value as a prognostic factor and/or target for treatment in larger patient populations.
