  Although autoimmune hepatitis<disease> ( AIH) is more common in women and affects people of all races/ethnicities , there is currently limited information regarding the relationship between race/ethnicity and AIH , especially in the context of underserved populations. We aim to evaluate the relationship between race/ethnicity and AIH and better characterize its clinical features among different racial groups. We conducted a 15-year retrospective analysis , from January 2002 to June 2017 , of patients seen at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital ( ZSFG). Sixty-three AIH patients and 2049 non-AIH controls were eligible for the study. The main predictor of interest was race/ethnicity , and the main outcome of interest was AIH diagnosis; other secondary measures recorded include clinical features such as ALT , bilirubin , and biopsy fibrosis<disease> at presentation. In a multivariable model adjusting for age and sex , we found that black ( OR 9.6 , 95 % CI 1.8-178) , Latino ( OR 25.0 , 95 % CI 5.3-448) , and Asian/Pacific Islander ( API) ( OR 10.8 , 95 % CI 2.2-196) race/ethnicity were associated with increased odds of an AIH diagnosis compared to the white reference group. Among people of colour with AIH , there were no significant differences in baseline ALT ( p = .45) , total bilirubin at presentation ( p = .06) , fibrosis<disease> at presentation ( p = .74) , and hospitalization ( p = .27). Race/ethnicity is an independent risk factor for AIH. The clinical features of AIH did not differ significantly among black , Latino , and API patients.
