  Infants are exposed to a wide range of potential pathogens in the first months of life. Although maternal antibodies acquired transplacentally protect full-term neonates from many systemic pathogens , infections at mucosal surfaces still occur with great frequency , causing significant morbidity and mortality. At least part of this elevated risk is attributable to the neonatal immune system that tends to favor T regulatory and Th2 type responses when microbes are first encountered. Early-life infection with respiratory viruses is of particular interest because such exposures can disrupt normal lung development and increase the risk of chronic respiratory conditions , such as asthma. The immunologic mechanisms that underlie neonatal host-virus interactions that contribute to the subsequent development of asthma have not yet been fully defined. The goals of this review are ( 1) to outline the differences between the neonatal and adult immune systems and ( 2) to present murine and human data that support the hypothesis that early-life interactions between the immune system and respiratory viruses can create a lung environment conducive to the development of asthma.
