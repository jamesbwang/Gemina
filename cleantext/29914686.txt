  Feline histiocytic sarcoma<disease> ( HS) is an aggressive and uncommon tumor originating from dendritic cells/macrophages. Here , a feline HS cell line , FHS-1 , was established from a case of feline HS and characterized. Immunohistochemically , FHS-1 cells were positive for vimentin and Iba-1 , and negative for MHC class II and CD163. FHS-1 cells were positive for Î±-naphthyl butyrate esterase staining , which was clearly inhibited by sodium fluoride. FHS-1 cells had phagocytic and antigen uptake/processing activities. Moreover , FHS-1 cells were tested for susceptibility to feline infectious peritonitis<disease> virus ( FIPV) strain 79-1146; however , this cell line was not susceptible to this viral strain. Although FHS-1 cells lost the expression of MHC class II and CD163 , our findings indicate that FHS-1 is a feline HS cell line that retains functional properties of dendritic cells/macrophages in terms of phagocytic and antigen uptake/processing activities. While FHS-1 cells are not suitable for in vitro study of FIP using strain 79-1146 , they may be applicable for studies aimed at developing new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for feline HS.
