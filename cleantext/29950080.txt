  To investigate the mechanism of the treatment of hyperlipidemia rats induced by Huangqi San. The 40 male SD rats were randomly divided into normal group , model group , Huangqi San low and high dose group ( 1 , 2 g · kg ⁻¹) , and positive lipitor group ( 2 mg · kg ⁻¹). The normal group feeds on base feed , and other groups feed on high-fat feed. After 8 weeks , the hyperlipidemia model was successful. After intervention by drugs for 13 weeks , fasting blood glucose , total cholesterol , triglycerides and LDL cholesterol content of all rats were measured. The pathological changes of liver and skeletal muscle of rats were observed in rats. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression levels of AMPK signaling pathway in the liver and skeletal muscles ( AMPK , ACC , CPT1A , SREBP2 , HMGCR). The degree of FPG , TC , TG and LDL-C were the highest in the model group , and the liver and skeletal muscle pathology were the most obvious. After intervention by Huangqi San and lipitor , a significant reduction in the blood sugar blood fat , liver , and skeletal muscle injury has improved significantly , except SREBF2 and HMGCR mRNA and protein expression of this enzyme is reduced , other AMPK pathway related mRNA and protein expression increased significantly. Huangqi San effect is superior to lipitor. Huangqi San may improve hyperlipidemia by regulating the AMPK signaling pathway , increasing the oxidation of fatty acids and inhibiting cholesterol synthesis.
