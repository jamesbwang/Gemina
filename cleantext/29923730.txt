  An NBS-induced intramolecular cycloaromatization for the synthesis of 10-phenanthrenols from electron-withdrawing group substituted 1-biphenyl-2-ylethanones is described. The in situ generated bromide was designed to act as an initiator for the radical C-H bond activation. An oxidative cross-dehydrogenative coupling reaction of a highly active C-H bond with an inert C-H bond readily occurs under mild conditions without the need for transition metals or strong oxidants.
