  Background Food addiction ( FA) is a controversial concept , denoting the craving for certain foods. Given the little information available , the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible relationships between FA and full-blown and subthreshold psychopathology or eating behaviors in subjects consulting nutritional biologists. Materials and methods Three-hundred and fifty subjects completed the following self-questionnaires: Yale Food Addiction Scale ( YFAS) , Structured Clinical Interview for Mood Spectrum , Self-Report , Lifetime Version ( MOOD-SR-LT) , Symptom Checklist-90-Revised ( SCL-90-R) , Structured Clinical Interview for Anorexic-Bulimic Spectrum , Self-Report , Lifetime Version ( ABS-SR-LT). Results Most of the subjects were women ( n = 278) and the remaining were 72 men. A large proportion of the subjects ( 77.1 %) had a YFAS score < 3 and 22.9 % ≥ 3 , with no difference between men and women. The YFAS scores ≥ 3 were significantly and positively related to the all ABS-SR-LT domains , as well as to three dimensions ( Depression<symptom> , Hypomania , Rhythmicity) of the MOOD-SR-LT , and some SCL-90-R domains ( Sensitivity , Psychoticism , General Symptom Index and Positive Symptom). Conclusion Our data , while indicating that FA is related to different subthreshold psychopathological domains , in particular , with both depressive and manic symptoms , as well as with rhythmicity of mood spectrum , or with eating subthreshold symptoms , would suggest that it might be a dimension underlying different conditions or symptom clusters.
