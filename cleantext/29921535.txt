  Pediatric pelvic injuries are rare. Due to anatomic differences of the immature pelvis , different injury patterns may occur as compared to adults. The purpose was to analyze the effect of skeletal maturity on pediatric pelvic injury pattern , associated injuries , and treatment intervention. Ninety children with a pelvic injury receiving treatment at a private orthopaedic practice in association with a Level One Teaching Trauma Center , between March 2002 and June 2011 , were retrospectively analyzed. Skeletal maturity was determined as closed triradiate cartilage. Forty-one ( 46 %) were skeletally immature and 49 ( 54 %) were skeletally mature. Mean age was 11.5 years ( 2-16). Fractures were 23 A2 , 1 A3 , 4 B1 , 44 B2 , 16 B3 , and 2 C2 according to OTA/AO classification. OTA B and C fractures were 26 LC1 ( lateral-compression) , 20 LC2 , 10 LC3 , 4 APC1 ( anterior-posterior-compression) , 5 APC2 , and 1 VS ( vertical-shear) injury according to Young and Burgess. Treatment of the pelvic injury was operative in 28 ( 31 %) and non-operative in 62 ( 69 %) of children. Mechanism of injury , Injury Severity Score ( ISS) , deaths , and associated injuries were recorded. More complex and unstable injuries occurred in skeletally mature vs. immature children ( p = 0.014). Skeletally mature children had a significantly higher rate of operative intervention ( p = 0.009). The ISS in skeletally mature children was higher 25 ( 1-66) than in skeletally immature children 17 ( 4-43) ( p = 0.013). 84 % ( 41) skeletally mature and 78 % ( 32) skeletally immature children sustained associated injuries. Twenty-two % ( 11) of all skeletally mature children sustained urinary tract injuries , but only 7 % ( 3) of all skeletally immature children ( p = 0.049). Skeletally mature children are more likely to sustain more complex injury patterns with a higher rate of operative treatment , to have a higher rate of associated injuries , and to have a higher ISS than immature patients.
