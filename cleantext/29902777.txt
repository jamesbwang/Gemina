  The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the micro hardness , color stability/ΔE , and degree of conversion/DC of a resin cement light cured through different ceramic spacers. Lithium-disilicate ceramic samples were obtained from IPS E-max CAD blocks ( HT A1) and IPS in-Ceram ( transparent neutral); and divided in 7 groups ( n = 8 for each test): CTR/control group; 06 M/0 .6 mm monolithic; 12 M/1 .2 mm monolithic; 20 M/2 .0 mm monolithic; 06B/0 .4 + 0.2 mm bilayered; 12B/1 .0 + 0.2 mm bilayered; 20B/1 .8 + 0.2 mm bilayered. The resin cement ( Variolink veneer) was light cured through the ceramic spacers. The resin cement samples were evaluated for ΔE using a spectrophotometer after 24 h , 7days and after aging ( 24 h in water at 60 °C). Knoop microhardness and DC tests were conducted immediately after light curing , after 24 h and 7days. All experimental groups showed similar microhardness values , although being lower than CTR group. Similar results were observed after 7days. ΔE was similar between all groups after 24 h ( except for 12B and 20B) , and increased for all groups after 7days and after artificial aging , especially for thicker and bilayer groups. Only 06 M showed values similar to CTR group. DC values were similar to all groups immediately after light curing , increasing after 24 h and 7days. After 7days , only group 20B showed lower DC than CTR group. A tendency of higher DC could be observed for monolithic and thinner ceramics. All test results showed strong correlation ( 0.9987). Ceramic interposition can reduce mechanical and physical properties of resin cements , especially with thicker and bilayered ceramics. Group 06 M showed the best ΔE overtime.
