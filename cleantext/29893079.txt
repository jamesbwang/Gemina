  Pichia<pathogen> pastoris is a versatile protein expression system. At present , the expression plasmids are integrated plasmids whereas the episomal plasmids are rarely used. In this study , the autonomously replicating sequence derived from yeast itself was ligated into the integrative expression vector pGAP to generate an autonomously replicative expression vector pGAPZαA-PARS. When the vector was used to express the xylanase ( XynA) gene in P. pastoris , the highest enzyme activity reached 343 U/mL with glycerol as the carbon source , which was 45.9 % higher than that of the integrative expression. At the same time , the specific enzyme activity of XynA was increased by 81.2 %. We further studied the expression level of recombinant strains with different carbon sources such as glycerol , glucose , sucrose and mixed carbon source ( sucrose glycerol = 1 2). The highest expression level was achieved with glycerol and the lowest with sucrose. The episomal expression vector pGAPZαA-PARS greatly promotes the application of P. pastoris in the food industry because GAP promoter does not require methanol as induction material. Meanwhile , the episomal vector can greatly improve the expression level , which lays the foundation for further research to improve the high expression of GAP promoter.
