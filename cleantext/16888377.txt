  We aimed to investigate the prevalence and distribution of abnormal glucose regulation , including prediabetes and newly diagnosed diabetes , according to different criteria in ischaemic stroke patients without a history of diabetes. Data were derived from a representative cohort across China. Prediabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose ( FPG) 5.6-6.9 mmol/L or 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT) 7.8-11.0 mmol/L or haemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c) 5.7-6.4 %. Newly diagnosed diabetes was defined as FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/L , 2 h OGTT ≥ 11.1 mmol/L or HbA1c ≥ 6.5 %. Among 1251 ischaemic stroke patients , 471 ( 37.5 %) were detected as prediabetes and 539 ( 43.1 %) were detected as newly diagnosed diabetes. Prediabetes was present in 118 ( 9.4 %) , 290 ( 23.2 %) and 314 ( 25.1 %) stroke patients , and newly diagnosed diabetes was present in 138 ( 11.0 %) , 370 ( 29.6 %) , and 365 ( 29.2 %) stroke patients , based on FPG , 2 h OGTT , and HbA1c criteria , respectively. Dependency on FPG alone would have missed 74.9 % of patients in the prediabetes range and 74.4 % of patients in the diabetes range. Our study demonstrated a high prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes in ischaemic stroke patients without a history of diabetes. OGTT and HbA1c helped detect the majority of prediabetes and newly diagnosed diabetes in ischaemic stroke patients.
