  The lack of estrogen in postmenopausal women is a key risk factor of the disorders of lipid metabolism and obesity. Except for estrogen replacement therapy ( ERT) , Chickpea peptides ( ChPs) may be a potential candidate for treating hyperlipidemia. In ovariectomized rats model , ChPs were found to decrease the body<symptom> weight , adipose tissue size , total cholesterol ( TC) , total triglyceride ( TG) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) , atherogenic index ( AI) in serum and liver TC , TG. Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) , bile acids in liver and feces , fecal TC and TG were observed to increase significantly ( P < 0.05). ChPs plays the role in inhibiting the activities of fatty acid synthetase ( FAS) and HMG-CoA reductase ( HMGR). The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( PPAR) γ and sterol regulatory element-binding protein ( SREBP) -1 c was down-regulated and the expression of Liver X receptor ( LXR) α , estrogen receptor ( ER) α and ERβ was up-regulated by ChPs. In HepG2 cell experiments , the cellular TC levels decreased and the uptake of NBD-cholesterol increased significantly after the treatments of Mw < 1kDa and Mw < 5kDa ChPs fractions. Val-Phe-Val-Arg-Asn ( VFVRN) could inhibit TC biosynthesis by decreasing the expression of HMGR. We demonstrated that ChPs could effectively regulate lipid metabolism disorders and restrain obesity caused by estrogen deficiency. VFVRN identified from ChPs could reduce the expression of HMGR to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
