  Previously studies showed that Forkhead transcription factor A1 ( FoxA1) was associated with sweat<symptom> secretion. To investigate the expression and localization of FoxA1 in the three-dimensional ( 3D) reconstructed eccrine sweat<symptom> glands , eccrine sweat<symptom> gland cells were transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice with Matrigel , and at 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 12 weeks post-transplantation , the reconstructed eccrine sweat<symptom> glands were removed and immunostained for FoxA1 and co-immunostained for FoxA1 and eccrine sweat<symptom> markers , K7 , carbonic anhydrase II ( CA Ⅱ) , gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 ( GCDFP-15) and α-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA) , and FoxA1 and sweat<symptom> secretion-related proteins , Na
