  Decay-accelerating factor ( CD55 or DAF) inhibits complement-dependent cytotoxicity. We determined that CD55 is overexpressed in 76.47 % of human non-small cell lung cancer tissue specimens. We therefore developed a lutetium-177-labeled chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD55. CD55-specific single-chain variable fragment ( scFv) was selected from a na√Øve chicken scFv phage-display library , converted to IgG , and radiolabeled with lutetium-177 to generate a
