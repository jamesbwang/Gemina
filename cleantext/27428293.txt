  The main goals of reconstruction of nasal defects are to restore the topographic subunit outline , thereby maintaining the aesthetic three-dimensional facial contours and more importantly ensuring a patent airway. Wide excision of tumours of the external nose can at times result in complex defects causing significant facial disfigurement and this poses a significant reconstructive challenge. Nasal reconstruction with only micro-vascular free flaps can at times produce poor aesthetic outcomes as distant skin often appears as a mismatched patch within the surrounding normal facial skin. We describe a novel technique for external nose reconstruction using a combination two well described local flaps , superiorly based nasolabial flap alongside a paramedian forehead flap.
