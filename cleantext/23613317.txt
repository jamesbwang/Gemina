  Glioblastoma ( GBM) promotes immunosuppression through upregulation of PD-L1 and regulatory T cell ( Treg) expansion , but the association of these suppressive factors has not been well elucidated. Here , we investigate a role of PD-L1 in expanding Tregs and the value of targeting the PD-1 receptor to inhibit Treg expansion. Quantitative RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were evaluated for an association between CD274 and FOXP3 transcript expressions and impact of FOXP3 on clinical outcomes. Peripheral leukocytes from patients with newly diagnosed GBM were profiled for PD-L1
