  Like pathogens , galling insects deliver effectors into plant tissues that induce gall formation. The gall midge Mayetiola destructor , also called Hessian fly , can convert a whole wheat seedling into a gall by inducing the formation of nutritive cells at the feeding site , inhibiting wheat growth , and reprogramming metabolic pathways of the attacked plants. Here we demonstrated the identification of a secreted Hessian fly protein , the nucleoside diphosphate kinase ( NDK) , in infested wheat plants through liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS) and western blots. In association with the NDK presence , enzymatic activity of NDK increased significantly in wheat tissues at the feeding site. In addition , there was a sudden increase in ATP abundance at the feeding site of infested susceptible wheat seedlings 24 h following Hessian fly larval infestation. Even though a direct link between cause and effect remains to be established , our data points to the direction that Hessian fly larvae injected NDK into wheat tissues as an effector protein , which plays a role in manipulating host plants and converting the plants into galls.
