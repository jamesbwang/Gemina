  The emergence of the T790M gatekeeper mutation in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR) gene is an important mechanism that can lead to the acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib or gefitinib. These drugs have been used in treating a subset of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) patients harboring EGFR activating mutations. Here we investigated the paths leading to the acquisition of the T790M mutation by establishing an erlotinib resistant PC9 cell model harboring ectopically introduced EGFR cDNA. We detected the emergence of T790M mutation within the EGFR cDNA in a subset of erlotinib resistant PC9 cell models through Sanger sequencing and droplet digital PCR-based methods , demonstrating that T790M mutation can emerge via de novo events following treatment with erlotinib. In addition , we show that the de novo T790M bearing erlotinib resistant PC9 cells are sensitive to the 3rd generation EGFR-targeted drug , WZ4002. Furthermore , GFP-based competition cell proliferation assays reveal that PC9 cells ectopically expressing EGFR mutant become more rapidly resistant to erlotinib than parental PC9 cells through the acquisition of the T790M mutation. Taken together , we believe that our findings expand upon the previous notion of evolutionary paths of T790M development , providing an important clue to designing a therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance.
