  In the last two decades , targeted therapies have enhanced tumor patient care and treatment success , however , metastatic growth still can not be stopped efficiently and , therefore , mortality rates remain high. Prevention strategies against formation of metastases are the most promising approach we have , however , due to lack of clinical validation studies , they have not yet entered routine clinical care. In order to smooth the way for efficient prevention , further preclinical and large clinical studies are required. In this context , the underlying molecular mechanisms and factors that lead to metastatic growth have to be explored , and potential preventive agents have to be tested. Thereby , special attention has to be paid to natural bioactive compounds which do not exert major adverse effects , like the plant-derived polyphenol Curcumin , which is known to be a powerful antitumor agent. So far , most of the preclinical studies with Curcumin have focused on its effect on inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and invasion , although , it is known that it also inhibits metastatic spread in vivo. This review discusses the preventive potential of this natural compound not only against tumor onset , but also against formation of metastases.
