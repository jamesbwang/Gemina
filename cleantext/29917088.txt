  To assess the feasibility and results of ` valve-in-valve ' implantation using the 23-mm CoreValve for the treatment of degenerated 19-mm and 21-mm Mitroflow bioprostheses. We retrospectively analysed all consecutive patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation for 19-mm and 21-mm Mitroflow bioprostheses. The height of implantation with respect to the ring of the Mitroflow prosthesis was targeted at -6 mm for the first 3 cases. In the following cases , the target was higher to promote free supra-annular movement of the leaflets. The procedure was successful in 17 of 18 patients ( 94 %). For implantations above the limit of -6 mm , the mean gradient was 10.4 ± 2.6 mmHg compared with 28.1 ± 11.6 mmHg for implantations below the limit of -6 mm ( P < 0.01). For patients with severe stenosis as main mechanism of failure of the bioprosthesis , the mean post-procedural gradient was 31.2 ± 11.8 mmHg compared with 12.7 ± 6 mmHg in the absence of severe stenosis ( P < 0.01). Patient-prosthesis mismatch ( indexed effective orifice area ≤ 0.85 cm2/m2) and severe mismatch ( indexed effective orifice area ≤ 0.65 cm2/m2) were present in 83 % ( 15 of 18) and 27 % ( 5 of 18) of patients , respectively. We did not notice any complications following the procedures. Six months after the procedure , functional status was improved in all patients. Our short series demonstrates the ability to perform transcatheter ` valve-in-valve ' implantation in 19-mm and 21-mm Mitroflow prostheses with satisfactory results , but high post-procedural gradients and patient-prosthesis mismatch remain a relatively frequent problem mostly when severe stenosis is the main mechanism of failure. Implantation in a high position is critical to decrease the rate of high postimplantation gradients.
