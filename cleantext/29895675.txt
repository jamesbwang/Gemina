  Mcl-1 , a pro-survival Bcl-2 family protein , is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells and plays a critical role in therapeutic resistance. It is well known that anti-cancer agents induce phosphorylation of Mcl-1 , which promotes its binding to E3 ubiquitin ligases and subsequent proteasomal degradation and apoptosis. However , other functions of Mcl-1 phosphorylation in cancer cell death have not been well characterized. In this study , we show in colon cancer cells that histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACi) induce GSK3Î²-dependent Mcl-1 phosphorylation , but not degradation or downregulation. The in vitro and in vivo anticancer effects of HDACi were dependent on Mcl-1 phosphorylation and were blocked by genetic knock-in ( KI) of a Mcl-1 phosphorylation site mutant. Phosphorylation-dead Mcl-1 maintained cell survival by binding and sequestering BH3-only Bcl-2 family proteins PUMA , Bim , and Noxa , which were upregulated and necessary for apoptosis induction by HDACi. Resistance to HDACi mediated by phosphorylation-dead Mcl-1 was reversed by small-molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors that liberated BH3-only proteins. These results demonstrate a critical role of Mcl-1 phosphorylation in mediating HDACi sensitivity through a novel and degradation-independent mechanism. These results provide new mechanistic insights on how Mcl-1 maintains cancer cell survival and suggest that Mcl-1-targeting agents are broadly useful for overcoming therapeutic resistance in cancer cells.
