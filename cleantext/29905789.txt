  The Sec protein secretion machinery includes proteins whose reaction coordinates involve large-scale conformational changes. Dynamic hydrogen-bond networks can provide structural plasticity required by the SecA protein motor and the SecY protein translocon. Here we discuss hydrogen-bond networks of these two Sec proteins from crystal structures and molecular simulations , and the usefulness of molecular simulations approaches to studying dynamic hydrogen bonds and their role in bacterial protein secretion.
