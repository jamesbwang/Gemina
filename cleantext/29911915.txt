  Incretin hormones , glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP) , and glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1) exert pleiotropic effects on endocrine pancreas and nervous system. Expression of GIP and GIP receptor ( GIPR) in neurons , their roles in neurogenesis , synaptic plasticity , neurotransmission , and neuromodulation uniquely position GIPR for therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative disorders. GIP analogs acting as GIPR agonists attenuate neurobehavioral and neuropathological sequelae of neurodegenerative disorders in preclinical models , e.g. Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) , Parkinson 's disease ( PD) , and cerebrovascular disorders. Modulation of GIPR signaling offers an unprecedented approach for disease modification by arresting neuronal viability decline , enabling neuronal regeneration , and reducing neuroinflammation. Growth-promoting effects of GIP signaling and broad-based neuroprotection highlight the therapeutic potential of GIPR agonists. Areas covered: This review focuses on the role of GIPR-mediated signaling in the central nervous system in neurophysiological and neuropathological conditions. In context of neurodegeneration , the article summarizes potential of targeting GIPR signaling for neurodegenerative conditions such as AD , PD , traumatic brain injury , and cerebrovascular disorders. Expert opinion: GIPR represents a validated therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders. GIPR agonists impart symptomatic improvements , slowed neurodegeneration , and enhanced neuronal regenerative capacity in preclinical models. Modulation of GIPR signaling is potentially a viable therapeutic approach for disease modification in neurodegenerative disorders.
