  Metastatic gastric cancer has a poor prognosis. We aim to study how clinical features and prognosis differs between different metastatic sites , and to identify prognostic factors for overall survival. We retrospectively reviewed patients with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma managed at a tertiary referral cancer center over a 5-year period. We divided our cohort into three groups based on the site ( s) of metastasis at presentation-peritoneal metastasis only ( P) , distant metastasis only ( D) , and peritoneal and distant metastases ( PD). We studied 470 patients with 175 ( 37.2 %) , 193 ( 41.1 %) and 102 ( 21.7 %) patients in the P , D and PD groups , respectively. Patients with peritoneal disease ( both P and PD) had higher proportions of patients experiencing chemotherapy disruption due to unplanned hospitalizations , which were also of a longer average duration. The P group had the longest overall median survival of 8.9 months compared to the PD and D groups with 7.4 and 5.5 months , respectively ( P < 0.001). On multivariate Cox regression analysis , the presence of â‰¥ 1 metastatic site ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.67; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.23-2.28; P = 0.001) was significantly associated with increased overall mortality , whereas palliative systemic chemotherapy ( HR 0.29; 95 % CI , 0.22-0.37; P < 0.001) and palliative gastrectomy ( HR 0.24; 95 % CI , 0.15-0.39; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with decreased overall mortality. Metastatic gastric cancer represents a heterogeneous disease , with specific disease complications and treatment outcomes unique to different metastatic sites. We can consider novel multimodality therapies for patient subgroups with isolated metastatic disease and good prognostic factors in a bid to improve long-term survival.
