  Edaravone is a powerful free radical scavenger that is in clinical use. However , data concerning its dose-response relationship against multiple free radicals remain sparse. The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate the dose-dependency of direct scavenging activity of edaravone against multiple free radical species. Free radical-scavenging activities of edaravone against six free radical species were evaluated by electron spin resonance spectroscopy using spin-trapping method. Edaravone scavenged the following free radicals in dose-dependent manners with reaction rate constants ( k The dose-dependent scavenging activities of edaravone against multiple free radical species were clearly illustrated. It is speculated that edaravone acts as antioxidant by dose-dependently scavenging multiple free radical species along the chain reactions of oxidative stress in surgery.
