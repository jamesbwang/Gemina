  Osteochondritis dissecans is a common disorder of knee and can be treated by various methods , depending on age of patient and stability of chondral fragment. In Osteochondritis dissecans ICRS type III lesion<symptom> i.e. articular cartilage discontinuity but no dislocation , variable rate of union as well as high rate of non-union was observed in previous studies when treated with arthroscopic or open reduction and fixation. In previous study it has been also shown that platelet rich plasma help in fracture healing. In this study we are trying to extend the benefit of platelet rich plasma to Osteochondritis dissecans lesion<symptom>. We took six patients with OCD , ICRS scale of OCD type III lesion<symptom>. All Patients were operated Arthroscopiclly. Chondral flap of OCD lesion<symptom> were fixed with stainless steel cannulated cancellous screw. To enhance union we used platelet rich plasma injections.. We access the union of chondral fragment to parent bone and knee function. Chondral fragment united to parent bone in all patients. To access knee function we used Tagner- Lysholm knee scoring system , in this study preoperatively score was 52.8 where as postoperatively it was 91.8. This study showed PRP is helpful in healing of chondral flap as all the chondral flap of osteochondral lesion<symptom> united in this study.
