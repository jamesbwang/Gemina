  It has been noted that inflammatory were intimately associated with the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC). Eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid play crucial roles in chronic inflammation<symptom>. Accordingly , there is an intricate relationship between eicosanoids and HCC , being supported by the epidemiological , clinical , and basic science studies. Herein , we intend to provide bioanalytical insights into the role of eicosanoids in HCC progression , from cell proliferation , angiogenesis migration , to apoptosis. Also , the analytical methods and biochemistry of eicosanoids are described.
