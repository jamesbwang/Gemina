  Essex-Lopresti Lesions<symptom> are rare injuries that are often missed in the acute setting. Delayed intervention may lead to chronic wrist and elbow pain and overall poor outcomes. The literature currently supports treatments that involve shortening of the ulna to reduce the relative degree of ulnar impaction , followed by attempted reduction of the distal radioulnar joint. Although such techniques may help to temporarily reduce wrist pain secondary to ulnar impaction , they do not address the proximal migration of the radius and ipsilateral radial head dislocation at the elbow. Subsequent procedures are often needed to replace or resect the radial head. We present a novel approach to chronic Essex-Lopresti lesions<symptom> resulting in anatomic restoration of forearm length with return of elbow and wrist flexion/extension as well as improved forearm pronation/supination.
