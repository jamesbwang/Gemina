  Bioinspired photonic crystals that can be used to precisely control the optical reflection of light of a specific wavelength by varying their thickness and refractive index have attracted much attention. Among them , photonic crystals that can reflect near-infrared light have attracted attention owing to their potential applications including window coating with heat-shielding property. However , photonic crystals with an optical function in practical use sometimes lose their function because of contamination. Here , a near-infrared reflection coating film with self-healing omniphobicity was designed and prepared by layer-by-layer assembly and an instant liquid phase omniphobization method. The fabricated films had a self-cleaning thermal shielding effect. The films were visually transparent and could be used to control the reflection peak of the near-infrared light ( range of 700-1000 nm) by adjusting the film thickness , which prevented the increase in temperature in enclosed spaces. After omniphobization , the films had self-cleaning properties of their surface and retained their optical properties. These functions are promising for practical application on windows as heat-shielding.
