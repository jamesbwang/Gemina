  The integration of additive manufacturing ( AM) technology within biological systems holds significant potential , specifically when refining the methods utilized for the creation of in vitro models. Therefore , examination of cellular interaction with the physical/physicochemical properties of 3D-printed polymers is critically important. In this work , skeletal muscle ( C
