  Tumor mitotic rate is a known prognostic variable in Stage I melanoma; however , its importance is unclear in Stages II and III. Patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic cutaneous melanoma from 2010 to 2014 were identified from the National Cancer Institute 's Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results registry. Of a total of 71,235 patients , the majority were white ( 94.7 %) , male ( 58.5 %) , and had a Stage I tumor ( 79.0 %). On univariable analysis , 5-year disease-specific survival decreased with each increasing tumor mitotic rate category of 0-3 , 4-10 , and > 10 mitoses/mm In this cohort study , tumor mitotic rate is an independent predictor of survival for localized melanoma.
