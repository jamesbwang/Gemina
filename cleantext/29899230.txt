  The present study used isometric tension recording to investigate the vasorelaxant effect of limonene ( LM) , carveol ( CV) , and perillyl alcohol ( POH) on contractility parameters of the rat aorta , focusing in particular on the structure-activity relationship. LM , CV , and POH showed a reversible inhibitory effect on the contraction induced by electromechanical and pharmacomechanical coupling. In the case of LM , but not CV and POH , this effect was influenced by preservation of the endothelium. POH and CV but not LM exhibited greater pharmacological potency on BayK-8644-induced contraction and on electromechanical coupling than on pharmacomechanical coupling. In endothelium-denuded preparations , the order of pharmacological potency on electrochemical coupling was LM < CV < POH. These compounds inhibited also , with grossly similar pharmacological potency , the contraction induced by phorbol ester dibutyrate. The present results suggest that LM , CV and POH induced relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle by means of different mechanisms likely to include inhibition of PKC and IP3 pathway. For CV and POH , hydroxylated compounds , it was in electromechanical coupling that the greater pharmacological potency was observed , thus suggesting a relative specificity for a mechanism likely to be important in electromechanical coupling , for example , blockade of voltage-dependent calcium channel.
