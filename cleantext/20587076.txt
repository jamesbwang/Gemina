  BACKGROUND Cytokeratin 19 ( CK19) is a typical epithelial marker. In this study , we determined whether epidermal growth factor ( EGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF) could enhance CK19 expression in adipose-derived stem cells ( ADSCs) , thereby inducing the differentiation of ADSCs into epithelial-like cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS ADSCs were isolated from perinephric fat , and the expression of CD29 , CD90 , and CD105 was confirmed. Following isolation , ADSCs were cultured in static medium or medium containing EGF or bFGF. RESULTS Flow cytometry revealed that EGF and bFGF could alter mesenchymal stem cell markers as well as the cell cycle of ADSCs. Western blotting and immunofluorescence revealed that after 14 days , EGF treatment enhanced the expression of CK19 in ADSCs. CONCLUSIONS Our findings offer important insight for the clinical use of ADSCs in the generation of epithelial-like cells in the future.
