  Despite recent advancements in diagnostic tools , the genomic landscape of hereditary hearing loss remains largely uncharacterized. One strategy to understand genome-wide aberrations includes the analysis of copy number variation that can be mapped using SNP-microarray technology. A growing collection of literature has begun to uncover the importance of copy number variation in hereditary hearing loss. This pilot study underpins a larger effort that involves the stage-wise analysis of hearing loss patients , many of whom have advanced to high-throughput sequencing analysis. Our data originate from the Infinium HumanOmni1-Quad v1 .0 SNP-microarrays ( Illumina) that provide useful markers for genome-wide association studies and copy number variation analysis. This dataset comprises a cohort of 108 individuals ( 99 with hearing loss , 9 normal hearing family members) for the purpose of understanding the genetic contribution of copy number variations to hereditary hearing loss. These anonymized SNP-microarray data have been uploaded to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and are intended to benefit other investigators interested in aggregating platform-matched array patient datasets or as part of a supporting reference tool for other laboratories to better understand recurring copy number variations in other genetic disorders.
