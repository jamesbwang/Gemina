  Complete mesocolic excision ( CME) has been proposed for colon cancer to improve oncological outcomes. The risks and benefits of laparoscopic CME have not been examined fully. We compared short- and long-term outcomes of CME with a conventional mesocolic excision ( non-CME) in laparoscopic right hemicolectomy ( RHC) for right-sided colon cancer. In total , 115 patients who underwent laparoscopic RHC with stage I-III right-sided colon cancer at Busan Paik Hospital from August 2007 to October 2011 were enrolled in this case-control study. Three trained colorectal surgeons reviewed videos of the surgeries; patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent a CME ( CME group , n = 34) and those who underwent a conventional mesocolic excision ( non-CME group , n = 81). There was no significant difference between the CME and non-CME groups in operative time , post-operative complications , or hospital stay. However , the CME group had more lymph nodes harvested ( P < 0.001) and lower blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( P = 0.016) versus the non-CME group. There was no difference in 5-year disease-free survival rate between the groups , but 5-year overall survival rate was 100 % in the CME group and 89.49 % in the non-CME group ( P < 0.05). Laparoscopic RHC with CME is safe and associated with better 5-year overall survival rate than non-CME for patients with stage I-III right-sided colon cancer. Implementation of CME surgery might improve oncological outcomes for patients with right-sided colon cancer.
