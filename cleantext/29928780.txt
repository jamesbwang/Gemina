  In resource-limited settings , mass food fortification is a common strategy to ensure the population consumes appropriate quantities of essential micronutrients. Food and government organizations in these settings , however , lack tools to monitor the quality and compliance of fortified products and their efficacy to enhance nutrient status. The World Health Organization has developed general guidelines known as ASSURED ( Affordable , Sensitive , Specific , User-friendly , Rapid and Robust , Equipment-free , and Deliverable to end-users) to aid the development of useful diagnostic tools for these settings. These guidelines assume performance aspects such as sufficient accuracy , reliability , and validity. The purpose of this systematic narrative review is to examine the micronutrient sensor literature on its adherence towards the ASSURED criteria along with accuracy , reliability , and validation when developing micronutrient sensors for resource-limited settings. Keyword searches were conducted in three databases: Web of Science , PubMed , and Scopus and were based on 6-point inclusion criteria. A 16-question quality assessment tool was developed to determine the adherence towards quality and performance criteria. Of the 2,365 retrieved studies , 42 sensors were included based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results showed that improvements to the current sensor design are necessary , especially their affordability , user-friendliness , robustness , equipment-free , and deliverability within the ASSURED criteria , and accuracy and validity of the additional criteria to be useful in resource-limited settings. Although it requires further validation , the 16-question quality assessment tool can be used as a guide in the development of sensors for resource-limited settings.
