  Recent advances in neuroscience and devices are ushering in a new generation of medical treatments. Engineered biodevices are demonstrating the potential to create long-term changes in neural circuits , termed neuroplasticity. Thus , the approach of engineering neuroplasticity is rapidly expanding , building on recent demonstrations of improved quality of life for people with movement disorders , epilepsy , and spinal cord injury. In addition , discovering the fundamental mechanisms of engineered neuroplasticity by leveraging anatomically well-documented systems like the spinal cord is likely to provide powerful insights into solutions for other neurotraumas , such as stroke and traumatic brain injury , as well as neurodegenerative disorders , such as Alzheimer 's , Parkinson disease , and multiple sclerosis. Now is the time for advancing both the experimental neuroscience , device development , and pioneering human trials to reap the benefits of engineered neuroplasticity as a therapeutic approach for improving quality of life after spinal cord injury.
