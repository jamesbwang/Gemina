  For reliable results , Reverse Transcription Quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT-qPCR) analyses depend on stably expressed reference genes for data normalization purposes. Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium<pathogen> that has become a serious threat worldwide. Unfortunately , there is no consensus for an ideal reference gene for RT-qPCR data normalization on K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen>. In this study , the expression profile of eleven candidate reference genes was assessed in K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> cells submitted to various experimental conditions , and the expression stability of these candidate genes was evaluated using statistical algorithms BestKeeper , NormFinder , geNorm , Delta C
