  The impact of total minimally invasive esophagectomy ( MIE) on early postoperative outcome and patient 's survival is a matter of recent discussion. We performed a 1:2 propensity score-matched comparison of 20 patients who underwent 3D-MIE and high intrathoracic esophagogastrostomy with 40 patients who underwent hybrid esophagectomy ( HYBRID) with laparoscopic gastric mobilization and open transthoracic esophagectomy and the same anastomosis for esophageal adenocarcinoma in 2014 and 2015. Matching criteria were tumor localization , age , gender , and neoadjuvant treatment. Both groups did not differ regarding overall postoperative complications ( MIE 55 % vs. HYBRID 50 % , p = 0.715) and anastomotic leakage ( MIE 15 % vs. HYBRID 5 % , p = 0.186). A significant difference was seen regarding the rate of postoperative pneumonia<disease> ( MIE 5 % vs. HYBRID 27.5 %; p = 0.040) and the postoperative ICU stay ( MIE median 1 day vs. HYBRID median 2 days , p < 0.001). The R0-resection rate was 100 % in both groups and median number of dissected lymph nodes was 32 for MIE and 35 for HYBRID ( p = 0.236). Significant differences between both groups were noticed for postoperative number of patients with use of opiate demand medication and numeric rating scale for pain ( NRSP maximum pain , median) both in favor of the MIE group ( MIE 25 % , NRSP 2 vs. HYBRID 60 % , NRSP 4; p = 0.011 , p < 0.001). Overall 2-year survival rate was 85 % in both groups. Total minimally invasive esophagectomy is superior to hybrid esophagectomy in regard of postoperative pain and rate of pneumonia<disease> No differences exist for postoperative surgical complications or short-term prognosis.
