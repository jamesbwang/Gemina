  Eukaryotic RNA can carry more than 100 different types of chemical modifications. Early studies have been focused on modifications of highly abundant RNA , such as ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA , but recent technical advances have made it possible to also study messenger RNA ( mRNA). Subsequently , mRNA modifications , namely methylation , have emerged as key players in eukaryotic gene expression regulation. The most abundant and widely studied internal mRNA modification is N
