  To investigate whether there is a difference in obstetrical and perinatal outcomes in blastocyst frozen-thawed embryo transfers ( FETs) compared with cleavage-stage FET. A retrospective cohort study. Not applicable. Women undergoing autologous FETs at either the blastocyst stage ( n = 118,572) or the cleavage stage ( n = 117,619) reported to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology in the years 2004-2013. None. Live birth , gestational age , birth weight , miscarriage. After controlling for confounders , there were a 49 % increased odds of live birth after blastocyst-stage FET compared with cleavage-stage FET ( odds ratio ( OR) = 1.49; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.44 , 1.54). Additionally , blastocyst FET was associated with a 68 % ( OR = 1.68; 95 % CI , 1.63 , 1.74) increased odds of clinical pregnancy and an 7 % ( OR = 0.93; 95 % CI , 0.88 , 0.92) decreased odds of miscarriage. There was also a 16 % increased odds of preterm delivery ( OR = 1.16; 95 % CI , 1.06 , 1.27) after blastocyst FET but no difference in birth weights. In patients undergoing FET , blastocyst-stage transfer is associated with higher live-birth rates when compared with cleavage-stage transfers. Furthermore , perinatal outcomes are similar between the groups.
