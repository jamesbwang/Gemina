  The human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) haplotype DRB1 * 15:01 is the major risk factor for multiple sclerosis ( MS). Here , we find that DRB1 * 15:01 is hypomethylated and predominantly expressed in monocytes among carriers of DRB1 * 15:01. A differentially methylated region ( DMR) encompassing HLA-DRB1 exon 2 is particularly affected and displays methylation-sensitive regulatory properties in vitro. Causal inference and Mendelian randomization provide evidence that HLA variants mediate risk for MS via changes in the HLA-DRB1 DMR that modify HLA-DRB1 expression. Meta-analysis of 14,259 cases and 171,347 controls confirms that these variants confer risk from DRB1 * 15:01 and also identifies a protective variant ( rs9267649 , p < 3.32 Ã— 10
