  A cost-effective microporous polymer was synthesized using cheap monomer and catalyst via one-step Scholl-coupling reaction , and its chemical , morphological characteristics and pore structure were investigated. The as-synthesized polymer with large surface area and narrow pore distribution ( centered in 1.2 nm) was prepared as a fiber coating for solid-phase microextraction ( SPME). Headspace SPME was used for the extraction of the light aromatic compounds , e.g. benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene , m-xylene , naphthalene and acenaphthene. The parameters influencing the extraction and desorption efficiencies , such as extraction temperature and time , salt concentration , desorption temperature and time were investigated and optimized. The results showed that the home-made fiber had superior extraction efficiencies compared with the commercial PDMS fiber. Under the optimized conditions , low detection limits ( 0.01-1.3 ng/L) , wide linear ranges ( from 50 to 20000 ng/L to 1-20000 ng/L) , good repeatability ( 4.2-9.3 % , n = 6) and reproducibility ( 0.30-11 % , n = 3) were achieved. Moreover , the practical applicability of the coating and proposed method was evaluated by determining the target light aromatic compounds in environmental water samples with satisfied recoveries ( 83.2 % -116 %).
