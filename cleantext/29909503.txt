  Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis ( SAP) in pediatric neurosurgery has poorly been characterized until now. This review gives an overview on the current literature extracting recommendations and guidelines. The current literature on SAP with special forcus on pediatric neurosurgerical procedures was reviewed. Further , available recommendations in online databases were checked. Clean neurosurgical , shunt , and implant surgeries are considered separately. To date , evidence-based data on SAP in pediatric neurosurgery remain sparse and there are no standardized approaches to an adequate use of antimicrobial agents for SSI prevention for this age group. Due to statistical needs , multi-center surveillance studies are needed for implementing SAP recommendations in pediatric neurosurgery.
