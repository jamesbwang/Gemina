  To investigate the influence of IL-6 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) , additional gene-gene and gene-environment interactions on coronary artery disease ( CAD) risk. A total of 751 participants ( 429 CAD patients and 322 controls) were recruited in this study. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association of IL-6 SNPs with CAD risk and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction ( GMDR) was performed to investigate the best interaction combinations for gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. CAD risk is significantly higher in carriers of C allele of the rs1800795 polymorphism than those with GG genotype ( CC + CG versus GG , adjusted OR ( 95 % CI) = 2.07 ( 1.56-2.86) , p < 0.001). GMDR analysis revealed rs1800795 was significantly interacted with tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking in two-locus model ( p < 0.0010). Current smokers with CC or CG of rs1800795 genotype have the highest CAD risk , OR ( 95 % CI) = 3.22 ( 2.45-3.94) and current drinkers with CC or CG of rs1800795 genotype have the highest CAD risk , OR ( 95 % CI) = 3.17 ( 2.20-4.24). The C allele of rs1800795 within IL-6 gene promoter , rs1800795-tobacco smoking and rs1800795-alcohol drinking interaction were all associated with increased CAD risk.
