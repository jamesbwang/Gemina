  Reversible encapsulation of liquid materials is a technical challenge in many applications such as for the transport and controlled delivery of active ingredients. In contrast to most state-of-the-art processes , capillary adsorbed solid particles can achieve chemical-reaction-free encapsulation by forming dense rafts which isolate the liquid from its surroundings. While the production conditions of such capsules have been characterized , the control of the armor robustness remains poorly described and understood. In this paper , we probe the armor robustness via impacts of droplets on encapsulated materials. Thereby , we establish the mechanisms and conditions of armor rupture and derive models that predict the rupturing thresholds or probabilities. Using monodisperse sized particles and gradually increasing the impacting drop velocity , a sharp transition from sustained to coalescing drops is observed. On mobile rafts made of particles at the water/air interface , the velocity threshold increases with increasing particle diameter while an opposite trend is observed on immobile rafts made of particles trapped at a gelified interface. Two models based on particle pair and triplet interactions , respectively , quantitatively match the experiments. Assembling rafts with particles of two different sizes significantly smoothens the coalescence transition , regardless of particle mobility. Beyond apparent similarities , rationalizing the rupturing probability of mobile and immobile armor evidences very different sensitivity to heterogeneities. On immobile armor , drop coalescence remains random and thus well described by the statistical particle distribution while on mobile armor the ruptures are preferably localized at the non-percolated parts of the granular network.
