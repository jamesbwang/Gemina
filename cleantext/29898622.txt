  Literature regarding career trajectory for postgraduate year 2 ( PGY-2) pharmacy residency specialty-trained pharmacists is limited. The objective of our study is to describe PGY-2 pharmacy residency training on career practice and satisfaction. A cross-sectional study surveyed graduates of PGY-2 pharmacy residency programs. Respondents were identified by current PGY-2 residency program directors requesting participation from their program alumni. The primary outcome was whether PGY-2 residency-trained pharmacists continued working within their specialty or not. Secondary outcomes included alternative specialty areas , current satisfaction with their specialty , and the necessity of completing a PGY-2. Among 647 respondents , 84 % completed their program in the past 6 years. The top 3 represented pharmacy specialties were critical care ( 19 %) , ambulatory care ( 14 %) , and oncology ( 13 %). Most respondents continue to practice in the same specialty as their PGY-2 residency program ( n = 572 , 87 %) compared with pharmacists who currently practice in other clinical specialties or areas of pharmacy ( n = 83 , 13 %). Critical care ( n = 28 , 33 %) had the largest specialty response no longer practicing in their PGY-2 residency program specialty with 42 % ( n = 12) now practicing within the emergency medicine specialty. The average satisfaction for their current specialty was 4.7 Â± 0.82 ( Likert scale of 1 = extremely dissatisfied to 5 = extremely satisfied). The vast majority PGY-2 pharmacy residency-trained pharmacists experienced training-practice concordance and are satisfied with their trained specialty. Among those with specialty training practice discordance , critical care training was most prevalent.
