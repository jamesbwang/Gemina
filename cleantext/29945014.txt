  The plants developed more dedicated regulatory pathways than the animals did to response various environment stresses , since they could not run away. The cross-talk among the pathways generally introduce non-trivial regulatory behaviors , from which the plants may benefit. For better understanding the regulatory mechanism due to cross-talk , we study in this work two entangled stress regulatory pathways in root cells. A quantitative model of the regulatory network is constructed in the simplest fashion. An analytic parameter-free approach is then employed to analyse the response tendencies. It leads us to a simple constraint on the non-linear regulatory exponents. Under the constraint , a transition to the non-monotonic growth inhibition happens at finite concentration of ABA , due to which the plants could survive from cold/heat stress. The parameter-free tendency analysis would also be applied to further experiments , especially in the case of insufficient data for multi-parameter fitting.
