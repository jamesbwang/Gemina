  Epilepsy is a major public health issue in low- and middle-income countries , where the availability and accessibility of quality treatment remain important issues , the severity of which may be aggravated by poor quality antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs). The primary objective of this study was to measure the quality of AEDs in rural and urban areas in 3 African countries. This cross-sectional study was carried out in Gabon , Kenya , and Madagascar. Both official and unofficial supply chains in urban and rural areas were investigated. Samples of oral AEDs were collected in areas where a patient could buy or obtain them. Pharmacological analytical procedures and Medicine Quality Assessment Reporting Guidelines were used to assess quality. In total , 102 batches , representing 3782 units of AEDs , were sampled. Overall , 32.3 % of the tablets were of poor quality , but no significant difference was observed across sites: 26.5 % in Gabon , 37.0 % in Kenya , and 34.1 % in Madagascar ( P = .7). The highest proportions of substandard medications were found in the carbamazepine ( 38.7 %; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 21.8-57.8) and phenytoin ( 83.3 %; 95 % CI 35.8-99.5) batches , which were mainly flawed by their failure to dissolve. Sodium valproate was the AED with the poorest quality ( 32.1 %; 95 % CI 15.8-42.3). The phenobarbital ( 94.1 %; 95 % CI 80.3-99.2) and diazepam ( 100.0 %) batches were of better quality. The prevalence of substandard quality medications increased in samples supplied by public facilities ( odds ratio ( OR) 9.9; 95 % CI 1.2-84.1; P < .04) and manufacturers located in China ( OR 119.8; 95 % CI 8.7-1651.9; P < .001). The prevalence of AEDs of bad quality increased when they were stored improperly ( OR 5.4; 95 % CI 1.2-24.1; P < .03). No counterfeiting was observed. However , inadequate AED storage conditions are likely to lead to ineffective and possibly dangerous AEDs , even when good-quality AEDs are initially imported.
