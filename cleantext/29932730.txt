  Quantum coherence is an invaluable physical resource for various quantum technologies. As a bona fide measure in quantifying coherence , the robustness of coherence ( ROC) is not only mathematically rigorous , but also physically meaningful. We experimentally demonstrate the witness-observable and operational feature of the ROC in a multiqubit nuclear magnetic resonance system. We realize witness measurements by detecting the populations of quantum systems in one trial. The approach may also apply to physical systems compatible with ensemble or nondemolition measurements. Moreover , we experimentally show that the ROC quantifies the advantage enabled by a quantum state in a phase discrimination task.
