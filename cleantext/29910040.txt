  Acute acidaemia is frequently observed during critical illness. Sodium bicarbonate infusion for the treatment of severe metabolic acidaemia is a possible treatment option but remains controversial , as no studies to date have examined its effect on clinical outcomes. Therefore , we aimed to evaluate whether sodium bicarbonate infusion would improve these outcomes in critically ill patients. We did a multicentre , open-label , randomised controlled , phase 3 trial. Local investigators screened eligible patients from 26 intensive care units ( ICUs) in France. We included adult patients ( aged ≥ 18 years) who were admitted within 48 h to the ICU with severe acidaemia ( pH ≤ 7 · 20 , PaCO Between May 5 , 2015 , and May 7 , 2017 , we enrolled 389 patients into the intention-to-treat analysis in the overall population ( 194 in the control group and 195 in the bicarbonate group). The primary outcome occurred in 138 ( 71 %) of 194 patients in the control group and 128 ( 66 %) of 195 in the bicarbonate group ( absolute difference estimate -5 · 5 % , 95 % CI -15 · 2 to 4 · 2; p = 0 · 24). The Kaplan-Meier method estimate of the probability of survival at day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group was not significant ( 46 % ( 95 % CI 40-54) vs 55 % ( 49-63); p = 0 · 09. In the prespecified AKIN stratum of patients with a score of 2 or 3 , the Kaplan-Meier method estimate of survival by day 28 between the control group and bicarbonate group was significant ( 63 % ( 95 % CI 52-72) vs 46 % ( 35-55); p = 0 · 0283). Metabolic alkalosis , hypernatraemia , and hypocalcaemia were observed more frequently in the bicarbonate group than in the control group , with no life-threatening complications reported. In patients with severe metabolic acidaemia , sodium bicarbonate had no effect on the primary composite outcome. However , sodium bicarbonate decreased the primary composite outcome and day 28 mortality in the a-priori defined stratum of patients with acute kidney injury.
