  Major depressive disorder ( MDD) , represent a major source of risk for suicidality. However , knowledge about risk factors for future suicide attempts ( SAs) within MDD is limited. The present longitudinal study examined a wide range of putative non-clinical risk factors ( demographic , social , lifestyle , personality) and clinical risk factors ( depressive and suicidal indicators) for future SAs among persons with MDD. Furthermore , we examined the relationship between a number of significant predictors and the incidence of a future SA. Data are from 1713 persons ( 18-65 years) with a lifetime MDD at the baseline measurement of the Netherlands Study of Depression<symptom> and Anxiety<symptom> who were subsequently followed up 2 , 4 and 6 years. SAs were assessed in the face-to-face measurements. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to examine a wide range of possible non-clinical and clinical predictors for subsequent SAs during 6-year follow-up. Over a period of 6 years , 3.4 % of the respondents attempted suicide. Younger age , lower education , unemployment , insomnia , antidepressant use , a previous SA and current suicidal thoughts independently predicted a future SA. The number of significant risk factors ( ranging from 0 to 7) linearly predicted the incidence of future SAs: in those with 0 predictors the SA incidence was 0 % , which increased to 32 % incidence in those with 6 + predictors. Of the non-clinical factors , particularly socio-economic factors predicted a SA independently. Furthermore , preexisting suicidal ideation and insomnia appear to be important clinical risk factors for subsequent SA that are open to preventative intervention.
