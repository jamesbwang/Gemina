  This study presents a critical appraisal of previously published study data of miRNAs in blood , urine and exosomes as biomarkers of bladder cancer ( BC). The evaluation included 39 articles published from the beginning of 2010 until September 2017 and searched in PubMed. The heterogeneity of studies , due to their clinicopathological variability , including insufficient consideration of diagnostic and prognostic biomarker guidelines and missing internal and external validation of data , do not currently allow the recommending of a useful miRNA marker as diagnostic or prognostic tool in BC. Future multi-institutional studies are necessary to overcome the deficiencies in these studies in order to prove the usefulness of circulating miRNAs as robust biomarkers for BC.
