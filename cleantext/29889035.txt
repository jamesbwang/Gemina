  Data about urology malpractice claims in our environment are scarce and should be considered a potential opportunity to `` learn from errors ''. We analyzed every claim for alleged malpractice in Urology managed by the Council of Medical Colleges of Catalonia between 1990 and 2012 , and specifically evaluated the clinical and medicolegal features of those cases with medical professional responsibility. We identified 182 cases in 22 years , but only the 25,74 % showed professional liability. Testicular torsion misdiagnosis , pregnancies after vasectomy and complications of lithiasis should be noted for their frequency of claims and rate of liability. 246 physicians were involved , 89 % were males and mean age was 45.6 years. Most cases ( n = 137 , 75.27 %) were processed in the courts. Urology has a medium risk of claims , with a moderate rate of medical professional liability and amount of compensation. There are specific actions that would lead to clinical safety improvements , particularly in testicular pathologies , vasectomy and lithiasis. Finally , more attention should be paid to proper patient information.
