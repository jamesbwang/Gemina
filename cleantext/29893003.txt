  In the present randomized study , we assessed the efficacy of ipragliflozin compared with sitagliptin in 124 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor-naïve and incretin-related agent-naïve patients were randomly assigned to receive additional 50 mg ipragliflozin or sitagliptin. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with > 0.5 % decrease in glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c) without body<symptom> weight gain at 12 weeks. For secondary endpoints , we measured several biomarkers related to metabolic changes. After 12 weeks , 53.9 % of participants in the ipragliflozin and 42.9 % in the sitagliptin group reached the primary endpoint ( P = 0.32). Decreases in homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance , body fat percentage and skeletal muscle mass index , and increases in free fatty acids , ketone body concentration and HDL cholesterol levels were greater in the ipragliflozin group. Increases in homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function and decreases in proinsulin-to-insulin ratio were greater in the sitagliptin group. No serious adverse events occurred in either group. In conclusion , ipragliflozin had beneficial effects on fat reduction , insulin resistance and lipid metabolism , while sitagliptin had beneficial effects on β-cell function.
