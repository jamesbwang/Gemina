  Iatrogenic transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( CJD) has occurred through particular medical procedures. Among them , dura mater grafts and pituitary-derived growth hormone obtained from human cadavers undiagnosed as CJD are the most frequent sources of infection. Recent advances in our knowledge about dura mater graft- and human pituitary-derived growth hormone-associated CJD patients have revealed that the combination of the infected CJD strain and the PRNP genotype of the patient determines their clinical , neuropathologic , and biochemical features. In this chapter , we summarize the clinical , neuropathologic , biochemical , and diagnostic features of dura mater graft- and human pituitary-derived growth hormone-associated CJD patients for the appropriate diagnosis of iatrogenic CJD.
