  In this paper the elemental changes of rat hippocampal formation occurring during the postnatal development were examined. Three groups of animals were used in the study. These were naive Wistar rats at the age of 6- , 30- and 60-days and the chosen life periods corresponded to the neonatal period , childhood and early adulthood in humans , respectively. For the topographic and quantitative elemental analysis X-ray fluorescence microscopy was applied and the measurements were done at the FLUO beamline of ANKA. The detailed quantitative and statistical analysis was done for four areas of hippocampal formation , namely sectors 1 and 3 of the Ammon 's horn ( CA1 and CA3 , respectively) , dentate gyrus ( DG) and its internal area ( hilus of DG , H). The obtained results showed that among the all examined elements ( P , S , K , Ca , Fe , Cu , Zn and Se) , only the levels of Fe and Zn changed significantly during postnatal development of the hippocampal formation and both the elements were significantly higher in young adults comparing to the rats in neonatal period. The increased Fe areal density was found in all examined hippocampal areas whilst Zn was elevated in CA3 , DG and H. In order to follow the dynamics of age-dependent elemental changes , the statistical significance of differences in their accumulation between subsequent moments of time was examined. The obtained results showed statistically relevant increase of Zn level only in the first observation period ( between 6th and 30th day of life). Afterwards the areal density of the element did not change significantly. The increase of Fe areal density took place in both examined periods , however the observed changes were small and usually not statistically relevant.
