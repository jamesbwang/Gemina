  The gerontopsychiatric population consists of nursing home residents with combined psychiatric and physical disabilities. A validated measure to assess well-being among this population is currently not available. This article is a first step toward the development of a well-being instrument for the gerontopsychiatric population. Potential measurement items were gathered and selected with the help of both gerontopsychiatric residents and care professionals. A total of 295 residents and their primary professional caregivers were interviewed. Theoretical and data-driven considerations were applied in the methodological process of scale construction. The final instrument comprised of 30 items within 3 dimensions of well-being ( physical , social , and psychological well-being). Reliability and validity were found to be adequate for all dimensions and subscales. The Laurens Well-Being Inventory for Gerontopsychiatry measures well-being in gerontopsychiatric nursing home residents. The first results regarding reliability and validity are promising. More research is needed especially to examine test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change.
