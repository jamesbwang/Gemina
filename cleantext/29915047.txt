  To quantitatively evaluate brain tissue and its corresponding function , knowledge of the 3D cellular distribution is essential. The gold standard to obtain this information is histology , a destructive and labor-intensive technique where the specimen is sliced and examined under a light microscope , providing 3D information at nonisotropic resolution. To overcome the limitations of conventional histology , we use phase-contrast X-ray tomography with optimized optics , reconstruction , and image analysis , both at a dedicated synchrotron radiation endstation , which we have equipped with X-ray waveguide optics for coherence and wavefront filtering , and at a compact laboratory source. As a proof-of-concept demonstration we probe the 3D cytoarchitecture in millimeter-sized punches of unstained human cerebellum embedded in paraffin and show that isotropic subcellular resolution can be reached at both setups throughout the specimen. To enable a quantitative analysis of the reconstructed data , we demonstrate automatic cell segmentation and localization of over 1 million neurons within the cerebellar cortex. This allows for the analysis of the spatial organization and correlation of cells in all dimensions by borrowing concepts from condensed-matter physics , indicating a strong short-range order and local clustering of the cells in the granular layer. By quantification of 3D neuronal `` packing , '' we can hence shed light on how the human cerebellum accommodates 80 % of the total neurons in the brain in only 10 % of its volume. In addition , we show that the distribution of neighboring neurons in the granular layer is anisotropic with respect to the Purkinje cell dendrites.
