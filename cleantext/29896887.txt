  Developmental stressors can have strong effects that persist well into adulthood , and are generally seen as detrimental. However , recent work suggests that a mild developmental stressor can have beneficial effects by preparing the organism to better withstand negative impacts when exposed to high levels of the stressor later in life , also known as a conditioning hormesis. Still , little is known about the influence of such hormetic effects on fitness-related measures. We hypothesized that exposure to a mild stressor during development will protect individuals later in life from the negative effects of a high heat stressor on immune function and reproduction. To test this hypothesis , we subjected zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata) to a repeated mild heat stressor ( 38 °C) as juveniles for 28 days. As adults , the birds were then exposed to a high heat stressor ( 42 °C) for 3 consecutive days and we examined the effects on immune function via wound<disease> healing , and on female reproductive output. We found that females given the mild heat stressor as juveniles healed wounds<disease> marginally slower , but also had higher clutch viability than controls. For the adult treatment , we saw that high heat had a stimulatory effect on clutch viability as well. Our findings point toward the occurrence of trade-offs between immune function and reproduction due to a cost of hormetic priming when the adult environment does not match that of early life.
