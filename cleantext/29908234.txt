  Methamphetamine ( METH) abuse is one the most worldwide problems with wide-ranging effects on the central nervous system ( CNS). Chronic METH abuse can associate with cognitive abnormalities and neurodegenerative changes in the brain. Agmatine , a cationic polyamine , has been proposed as a neuromodulator that modulates many effects of abused drugs. The aim of this study was to determine if agmatine can decrease the impairment effect of METH on memory and hippocampal CaMKII-α gene expression , a gene that plays a major role in memory. Male wistar rats ( 200-220 g) were allocated into 7 groups , including 5 groups of saline , METH ( 1 , 2 mg/kg) , Agmatine ( 5 , 10 mg/kg) and 2 groups of agmatine ( 5 , 10 mg/kg) with higher doses of METH ( 2 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days ( n = 8 in each group). All injections were done intraperitoneally and agmatine was administrated 10 min before METH treatment. Furthermore , Passive avoidance learning ( PAL) test was assessed on the 5th day. Retention test was done 24 h after training and the rats were sacrificed immediately. Hippocampi were removed and stored at -80 °C. Finally , hippocampal CaMKII-α gene expression was measured using Quantitative Real-time PCR. Our data showed that chronic METH dose-dependently impaired PAL retrieval , as it decreased step-through latency ( STL) and increased time spent in the dark compartment ( TDC). While Agmatine with a higher dose ( 10 mg/kg) significantly decreased impairment effect of METH ( 2 mg/kg) on PAL and memory. Also , molecular results revealed that METH ( 2 mg/kg) markedly decreased hippocampal CaMKII-α gene expression while agmatine ( 10 mg/kg) co-adminstration prevented it. Taken together , the results propose that agmatine may provide a potential therapy for learning and memory deficits induced by METH.
