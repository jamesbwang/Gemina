  The ability of a person to run on the surface of a suspension of cornstarch and water has fascinated scientists and the public alike. However , the constitutive relation obtained from traditional steady-state rheology of cornstarch and water suspensions has failed to explain this behavior. In another paper we presented an averaged constitutive relation for impact rheology consisting of an effective compressive modulus of a system-spanning dynamically jammed structure ( R. Maharjan et al. , this issue , Phys. Rev. E 97 , 052602 ( 2018) 10.1103/ PhysRevE .97.052602). Here we show that this constitutive model can be used to quantitatively predict , for example , the trajectory and penetration depth of the foot of a person walking or running on cornstarch and water. The ability of the constitutive relation to predict the material behavior in a case with different forcing conditions and flow geometry than it was obtained from suggests that the constitutive relation could be applied more generally. We also present a detailed calculation of the added mass effect to show that while it may be able to explain some cases of people running or walking on the surface of cornstarch and water for pool depths H > 1.2 m and foot impact velocities V _ ( I) > 1.7 m/s , it can not explain observations of people walking or running on the surface of cornstarch and water for smaller H or V _ ( I).
