  Hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) is associated with the development of a wide spectrum of liver diseases. The involvement of miRNAs in HBV<pathogen> replication is being gradually identified. Among these miRNAs , miR-146a expression was found to be positively correlated with HBV replication levels. However , the regulatory relationship between miR-146a and HBV replication is still unclear. In the present study , miR-146a was upregulated in HBV-expressing HepG2 .2.15 cells compared with HepG2 cells. Overexpression of miR-146a or knockdown of Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 ( ZEB2) promoted HBV replication and expression , while downregulation of miR-146a or overexpression of ZEB2 suppressed HBV replication and expression. In addition , miR-146a was demonstrated to directly target ZEB2. Furthermore , ZEB2 silencing abated anti-miR-146a-induced inhibition on HBV replication and expression. These findings suggested that miR-146a promoted HBV replication by targeting ZEB2 , providing a new antiviral strategy for HBV infection.
