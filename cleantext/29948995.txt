  One of the most dangerous human pathogens with high prevalence worldwide is Streptococcus<pathogen> pyogenes<pathogen> , which has major impacts on global morbidity and mortality. A major challenge for S pyogenes vaccine development is the detection of epitopes that confer protection from infection by multiple S.<pathogen> pyogenes<pathogen> types. Our aim was to identify the most conserved and immunogenic antigens of S.<pathogen> pyogenes<pathogen> , which can be a potential candidate for vaccine design in the future. Eight important surface proteins were analyzed. Using different prediction servers , strongest epitopes were selected. They had the ability to stimulate the humoral and cell-mediated immune system. Molecular docking was performed for measuring free-binding energy of selected epitopes. Seven epitopes from three surface proteins were selected as potential candidates for vaccine development. Conservation of selected epitopes among different Streptococcus<pathogen> types was checked. Further in vitro and in vivo tests are required to validate the suitability of the epitopes for vaccine design.
