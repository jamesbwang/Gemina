  Optimal surgical approach for tibial shaft fractures remains controversial. We perform a meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) to compare the clinical efficacy and prognosis between infrapatellar and suprapatellar intramedullary nail in the treatment of tibial shaft fractures. PubMed , OVID , Embase , ScienceDirect , and Web of Science were searched up to December 2017 for comparative RCTs involving infrapatellar and suprapatellar intramedullary nail in the treatment of tibial shaft fractures. Primary outcomes were blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , visual analog scale ( VAS) score , range of motion , Lysholm knee scores , and fluoroscopy times. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and postoperative complications. We assessed statistical heterogeneity for each outcome with the use of a standard Ï‡ Four RCTs involving 293 participants were included in our study. The present meta-analysis indicated that there were significant differences between infrapatellar and suprapatellar intramedullary nail regarding the total blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , VAS scores , Lysholm knee scores , and fluoroscopy times. Suprapatellar intramedullary nailing could significantly reduce total blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , postoperative knee pain , and fluoroscopy times compared to infrapatellar approach. Additionally , it was associated with an improved Lysholm knee scores. High-quality RCTs were still required for further investigation.
