  Porous silicon ( PSi) has attracted wide interest as a potential material for various fields of nanomedicine. However , until now , the application of PSi in photothermal therapy has not been successful due to its low photothermal conversion efficiency. In the present study , biodegradable black PSi ( BPSi) nanoparticles were designed and prepared via a high-yield and simple reaction. The PSi nanoparticles possessed a low band gap of 1.34 eV , a high extinction coefficient of 13.2 L/g/cm at 808 nm , a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 33.6 % , good photostability , and a large surface area. The nanoparticles had not only excellent photothermal properties surpassing most of the present inorganic photothermal conversion agents ( PCAs) but they also displayed good biodegradability , a common problem encountered with the inorganic PCAs. The functionality of the BPSi nanoparticles in photothermal therapy was verified in tumor-bearing mice in vivo. These results showed clearly that the photothermal treatment was highly efficient to inhibit tumor growth. The designed PCA material of BPSi is robust , easy to prepare , biocompatible , and therapeutically extremely efficient and it can be integrated with several other functionalities on the basis of simple silicon chemistry.
