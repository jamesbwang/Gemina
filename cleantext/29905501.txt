  Patients diagnosed with advanced stages of gastrointestinal ( GI) malignancies are often quite symptomatic , with symptoms primarily related to anatomic sites of obstruction. Endoscopic approaches to the palliation of GI malignancies have begun to overtake surgical approaches as first line in interventional management. We brought together a team of interventional gastroenterologists and palliative care experts to collate practical pearls for the types of endoscopic interventions used for symptom management in patients with GI malignancies. In this article , we use a `` Top 10 '' format to highlight issues that may help palliative care physicians recognize common presentations of advanced GI malignancies , address interventional approaches to improve symptom burden , and improve the quality of shared decision making and goals-of-care discussions.
