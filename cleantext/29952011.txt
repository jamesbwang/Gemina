  Acquired dermal melanocytosis of the face and extremities ( ADMFE) is an unusual form of acquired dermal melanocytosis ( ADM). In this paper , we report a case of ADMFE and review the published literature. Our review highlights several clinical differences between ADMFE and ADM: ( i) more frequent involvement of the nasal alae in ADMFE than in ADM , ( ii) less frequent involvement of the cheeks in ADMFE than in ADM , ( iii) limbs affected in all cases of ADMFE but in few cases of ADM , and ( iv) frequent involvement of conjunctiva and/or gingiva in ADMFE but very rare involvement in ADM. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that ADMFE is clinically distinct from the classic form of ADM , and gaining an understanding of its phenotype will enable accurate diagnosis and early intervention by Q-switched laser therapy , which should benefit those patients with disease-related cosmetic issues.
