  Adrenal gland disorders can be asymptomatic and detected incidentally via imaging techniques such as ultrasound , computed tomography ( CT) , positron emission tomography , and magnetic resonance imaging. Fusion anomaly is a condition that can be attributed to errors in the developmental process and may be detected via these imaging modalities. We present a case of butterfly adrenal gland in a 61-year-old man with CT and magnetic resonance images. In our patient , this anomaly is also accompanied by unilateral renal agenesis and a diaphragmatic defect. Positron emission tomography-CT , contrast-enhanced CT , and magnetic resonance images are presented. To the best of our knowledge , this is the second case in which coexistence of unilateral renal agenesis and butterfly adrenal gland anomaly in an adult patient has been documented.
