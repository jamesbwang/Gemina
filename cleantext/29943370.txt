  Currently , we use the Nipro paracorporeal VAD ( p-VAD) for initial short-term ventricular support , as a bridge to decision ( BTD) or a bridge to candidacy ( BTC) treatment , in Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support ( INTERMACS) levels 1 and 2 patients. However , it is possible that compared to patients with primary implantable-VADs ( P-iVAD) , the bridge-to-bridge ( BTB) patients are more likely to develop complications. This retrospective study used data from 24 consecutive BTB patients who were initially implanted with Nipro p-VAD as BTD or BTC treatments between April 2011 and March 2016 , and subsequently underwent conversion to an i-VAD. The data from 72 patients who underwent a primary i-VAD ( P-iVAD) procedure were used for comparison. Between the two groups , there was no significant difference in the incidence of infectious events ( p = 0.72) or stroke ( p = 0.44). Orthotropic heart transplantation was performed in 6 of the 24 patients in the BTB group and in 21 of the 72 patients in the P-iVAD group. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 95.8 % and 95.8 % in the BTB group and 91 % and 85.8 % in the P-iVAD group; these values were not significantly different between groups ( p = 0.91). Based on these results we conclude that BTB using Nipro p-VAD is a reasonable strategy for treating patients with severe decompensated end-stage
