  The Transient Receptor Potential ( TRP) family of selective and non-selective ion channels is well represented throughout the mammalian gastrointestinal track. Several members of the Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid ( TRPV) subfamily have been identified in contributing to modulation of mobility , secretion and sensitivity of the human intestine. Previous studies have focused on the detection of TRPV mRNA levels in colon tissue of patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) whereas little information exists regarding TRPV channel expression in the colonic epithelium. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression levels of TRPV1 , TRPV2 , TRPV3 and TRPV4 in mucosa epithelial cells of colonic biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC) in comparison to colonic resections from non-IBD patients ( control group). Immunohistochemistry , using specific antibodies and quantitative analyses of TRPV-immunostained epithelial cells , was performed in semi-serial sections of the samples. TRPV1 expression was significantly decreased whereas TRPV4 expression was significantly increased in the colonic epithelium of UC patients compared to patients in the control group (
