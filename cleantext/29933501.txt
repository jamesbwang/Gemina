  It is not known how physical exercise affects the risk of different types of fractures , especially in highly active individuals. To investigate this association , we studied a cohort of 118,204 men and 71,757 women who from 1991 to 2009 participated in Vasaloppet , a long-distance cross-country skiing race in Sweden , and 505,194 nonparticipants frequency-matched on sex , age , and county of residence from the Swedish population. Participants ranged from recreational exercisers to world-class skiers. Race participation , distance of race run , number of races participated in , and finishing time were used as proxies for physical exercise. Incident fractures from 1991 to 2010 were obtained from national Swedish registers. Over a median follow-up of 8.9 years , 53,175 fractures of any type , 2929 hip , 3107 proximal humerus , 11,875 lower leg , 11,733 forearm , and 2391 vertebral fractures occurred. In a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis using time-updated exposure and covariate information , participation in the race was associated with an increased risk of any type of fracture ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 1.02; 95 % CI , 1.00 to 1.05); forearm fractures had an HR , 1.11 with a 95 % CI , 1.06 to 1.15. There was a lower risk of hip ( HR , 0.75; 95 % CI , 0.67 to 0.83) , proximal humerus ( HR , 0.90; 95 % CI , 0.82 to 0.98) , and lower leg fractures ( HR , 0.93; 95 % CI , 0.89 to 0.97) , whereas the HR of vertebral fracture was 0.97 with a 95 % CI , 0.88 to 1.07. Among participants , the risk of fracture was similar irrespective of race distance and number of races run. Participants close to the median finishing time had a lower risk of fracture compared with faster and slower participants. In summary , high levels of physical exercise were associated with a slightly higher risk of fractures of any type , including forearm fractures , but a lower risk of hip , proximal humerus , and lower leg fractures.
