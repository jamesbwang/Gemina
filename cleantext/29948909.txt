  Influence of fixation medium and storage conditions as well as impact of sample mineralisation procedure on determination of minerals in human fascia lata<pathogen> was examined and discussed. Freezing and storage in 10 % neutral buffered formalin solution and in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde were used as the preservation methods of the samples. The concentrations of , both essential and toxic , elements were measured by ICP-OES method in fascia lata<pathogen> samples mineralised with concentrated nitric acid in a closed microwave system and in open vessels heated on a hot plate. Freezing was found as the best preserving method of fascia lata<pathogen> samples because of the number of elements determined and determination precision. The trace element ( Cd , Cr , Cu , Fe , Ni , Sr , Zn) concentrations obtained in samples decomposed using the conventional hot plate were different from analogous measurements in solutions obtained after application of closed vessels and microwave energy assistance. Differences between the mineral compositions of fascia samples variously preserved and mineralised were statistically evaluated and discussed. Interelement correlations were analysed taking into account an impact of various methods of sample conservation. Strong , positive association between element content was discovered for Cr-Ba , Mn-Ba , P-Ba , Sr-Ba , Sr-Ca , Zn-Ca , Mn-Cr , Pb-Cr , Sr-Cr , Mg-Fe , P-Fe , Pb-Ni , Ti-Ni and Sr-P pairs of elements.
