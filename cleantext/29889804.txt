  In this report , we present a young infant with multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis , who after cladribine and cytarabine salvage treatment developed immune thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( IT). On review of the literature , there were no previous reports of Langerhans cell histiocytosis-associated IT. Treatment of the IT with intravenous immunoglobulin and oral corticosteroids was unsuccessful. Eltrombopag , in combination with a 4-day course of dexamethasone was commenced as second-line therapy. Platelet recovery occurred 10 days after initiation of eltrombopag. The immune thrombocytopenia<symptom> remains in long-term remission despite cessation of eltrombopag. Eltrombopag was safe and well tolerated.
