  Trimetazidine ( TMZ) is a metabolic agent with significant anti-ischemic properties. By inhibiting the terminal enzyme in the Î²-oxidation pathway , it shifts the energy substrate metabolism , enhancing glucose metabolism. Thus , it maintains the required energy production with less oxygen consumption , an effect necessary in cases of myocardi. Trimetazidine was recently reaccredited as add-on therapy for symptomatic treatment in patients with stable angina , not adequately controlled or intolerant to first-line therapy. Trimetazidine was included in the European Society of Cardioloy 2013 guidelines for the management of stable coronary artery disease. Although TMZ has been used in cardiology for > 40 years , only a few studies have assessed its effects in patients with acute ischemic conditions. This review summarizes the current literature regarding the addition of TMZ in patients with acute ischemic conditions ( acute myocardial infarction , ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction , non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction , percutaneous coronary intervention , and coronary artery bypass grafting). There is growing evidence from recent studies that the addition of TMZ in patients with such conditions is beneficial in terms of myocardial damage and major cardiac events as well as decreasing reperfusion injury and contrast-induced nephropathy.
