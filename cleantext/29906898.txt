  Fractional transport equations are used to build an effective model for transport across the running sandpile cellular automaton ( Hwa et al. , Phys. Rev. A 45 , 7002 ( 1992) PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/ PhysRevA .45.7002). It is shown that both temporal and spatial fractional derivatives must be considered to properly reproduce the sandpile transport features , which are governed by self-organized criticality , at least over sufficiently long or large scales. In contrast to previous applications of fractional transport equations to other systems , the specifics of sand motion require in this case that the spatial fractional derivatives used for the running sandpile must be of the completely asymmetrical Riesz-Feller type. Appropriate values for the fractional exponents that define these derivatives in the case of the running sandpile are obtained numerically.
