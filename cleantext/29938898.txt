  Offset analgesia ( OA) is a pain-modulating mechanism described as a disproportionately large decrease in pain intensity evoked by a discrete decrease in stimulus temperature. The role of the opioidergic , serotonergic and noradrenergic systems on OA remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether OA is modulated by an opioid ( oxycodone) and a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor ( venlafaxine) in terms of psychophysical assessments. In this randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled cross-over study , 20 healthy male participants ( mean age: 24.6 Â± 2.5 years) received 10 mg oxycodone , 37.5 mg venlafaxine or placebo twice daily for 5 days in three periods. OA was induced by noxious thermal stimulation on the forearm at baseline and last day of treatment. A control session of constant stimulus intensity was included for comparison. OA magnitude was unaffected by oxycodone and venlafaxine ( p = 0.20 and p = 0.90 , respectively). Oxycodone affected the control paradigm where a decreased rating of pain intensity was observed compared to placebo ( p = 0.001). OA could not be modulated by oxycodone or venlafaxine and may be a robust phenomenon in healthy volunteers and not suitable for exploring pharmacological mechanisms of analgesia in human beings.
