  We describe computer simulations of thermal convection and magnetic field generation in Jupiter 's deep interior: that is , its convective dynamo. Results from three different simulations highlight the importance of including the dynamics in the very deep interior , although much of the convection and field generation seems to be confined to the upper part of the interior. A long-debated question is to what depth do Jupiter 's zonal winds extend below its surface. Our simulations suggest that , if global latitudinally banded patterns in Jupiter 's near-surface magnetic and gravity fields were detected by Juno , NASA 's orbiting spacecraft at Jupiter ( Bolton S , et al.
