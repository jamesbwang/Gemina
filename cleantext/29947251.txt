  Comparisons of communities across cities are rare in social epidemiology. Our prior work exploring racial/ethnic segregation and the prevalence of low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( LBW) in communities from two large urban cities showed a strong relationship in Chicago and a very weak relationship in Toronto. This study extends that work by examining the association between racial/ethnic minority segregation and LBW in total of 307 communities in five North American cities: Baltimore , Boston , Chicago , Philadelphia , and Toronto. We used Pearson correlation coefficients and OLS regression models to examine potential variability in the association between racial/ethnic minority segregation and LBW , controlling for community-level unemployment. In a combined model with community-level data from all cities , a 10 % increase in minority composition is associated with a 0.7 % increase in LBW. While racial/ethnic minority segregation and unemployment are not associated with LBW in Toronto , these social determinants have strong and significant associations with LBW across communities in the four US cities in the analysis. Subsequent models revealed opposite effects for percentage non-Hispanic Black and percentage Hispanic. Across communities in the US cities in this analysis , there is considerable similarity in the strength of the effect of racial/ethnic segregation on LBW. Future work should incorporate communities from additional cities , looking to identify community assets and public policies that allow some minority communities to thrive , while other minority communities suffer from a high prevalence of LBW. More work is also needed on the generalizability of these patterns to other health outcomes.
