  Estimation of heritability is an important task in genetics. The use of linear mixed models ( LMMs) to determine narrow-sense single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP)- heritability and related quantities has received much recent attention , due of its ability to account for variants with small effect sizes. Typically , heritability estimation under LMMs uses the restricted maximum likelihood ( REML) approach. The common way to report the uncertainty in REML estimation uses standard errors ( SEs) , which rely on asymptotic properties. However , these assumptions are often violated because of the bounded parameter space , statistical dependencies , and limited sample size , leading to biased estimates and inflated or deflated confidence intervals ( CIs). In addition , for larger data sets ( e.g. , tens of thousands of individuals) , the construction of SEs itself may require considerable time , as it requires expensive matrix inversions and multiplications. Here , we present FIESTA ( Fast confidence IntErvals using STochastic Approximation) , a method for constructing accurate CIs. FIESTA is based on parametric bootstrap sampling , and , therefore , avoids unjustified assumptions on the distribution of the heritability estimator. FIESTA uses stochastic approximation techniques , which accelerate the construction of CIs by several orders of magnitude , compared with previous approaches as well as to the analytical approximation used by SEs. FIESTA builds accurate CIs rapidly , for example , requiring only several seconds for data sets of tens of thousands of individuals , making FIESTA a very fast solution to the problem of building accurate CIs for heritability for all data set sizes.
