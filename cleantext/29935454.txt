  The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of inorganic species on torrefaction process and product properties. Torrefaction process of raw and leached rice husk was performed at different temperatures between 210 and 270 Â°C. Inorganic species have significant effect on the torrefaction process and properties of torrefaction products. The results indicated that solid yield increased , gas yield decreased and liquid yield remained unchanged for leached rice husk when compared to raw rice husk. Gas products from torrefaction process mainly contained CO
