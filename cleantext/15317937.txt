  Release factors RF1 and RF2 promote hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA during translation termination. The GTPase RF3 promotes recycling of RF1 and RF2. Using single molecule FRET and biochemical assays , we show that ribosome termination complexes that carry two factors , RF1-RF3 or RF2-RF3 , are dynamic and fluctuate between non-rotated and rotated states , whereas each factor alone has its distinct signature on ribosome dynamics and conformation. Dissociation of RF1 depends on peptide release and the presence of RF3 , whereas RF2 can dissociate spontaneously. RF3 binds in the GTP-bound state and can rapidly dissociate without GTP hydrolysis from termination complex carrying RF1. In the absence of RF1 , RF3 is stalled on ribosomes if GTP hydrolysis is blocked. Our data suggest how the assembly of the ribosome-RF1-RF3-GTP complex , peptide release , and ribosome fluctuations promote termination of protein synthesis and recycling of the release factors.
