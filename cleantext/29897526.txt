  Holism is an ancient theme concept that has resurfaced in recent literature , and that requires informed and intentional use in order to preserve its utility. This paper provides a historical and conceptual reintroduction of the notion of holism as it relates to health , with the hopes of informing the term 's use in public health discourse. It also addresses the challenges that a lack of conceptual clarity about holistic health imposes on public health and health promotion discussions. It describes how the use and conceptualizations of holism are shifting in health promotion and argues that failing to accurately define and delineate its scope risks diluting its utility for future health promotion applications. We address these two problems , and build an argument for a rediscovery of the theory of holism in public health and health promotion , globally.
