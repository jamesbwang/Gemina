  T cells from SLE patients have reduced protein levels of RasGRP1 , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras , and increased transcript of alternatively spliced ( AS) forms lacking exon 11. Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 ( SRSF1) binds pre-mRNA to regulate AS forms of several genes , including CD3Î¶ in SLE T cells. This study aimed to assess whether SRSF1 controls the expression of RasGRP1 in T cells from SLE patients. We studied T cells from 45 SLE and 18 healthy subjects. Expression levels of SRSF1 , wild type ( WT) RasGRP1 and DNA methyltransferase ( DNMT) 1 were assessed by qPCR. Direct binding of SRSF1 to exon11 of RasGRP1 mRNA was evaluated by an oligonucleotide-protein pulldown assay. Healthy T cells and SLE T cells were treated with SRSF1-specific siRNA and SRSF1 expression vector , respectively , then evaluated for mRNA/protein expressions. SRSF1 expression levels were significantly lower in T cells from SLE patients compared to those from healthy subjects and correlated inversely with disease activity and positively with those of RasGRP1-WT and DNMT1. SRSF1 directly bound to exon11 of RasGRP1 mRNA. Silencing of SRSF1 in human T cells led to increased ratio of RasGRP1-AS to WT and decreased RasGRP1 protein , whereas overexpression of SRSF1 in SLE T cells recovered RasGRP1 , which induced DNMT1/IL -2 expression. SRSF1 controls the alternative splicing of RasGRP1 and subsequent protein expression. Our findings extend evidence that alternative splicing plays a central role in the aberrant T cell function in patients with SLE by controlling the expression of multiple genes.
