  Biomimetic scaffolds are of great interest to tissue engineering ( TE) and tissue repair as they support important cell functions. Scaffold coating with soluble collagen-I has been used to achieve better tissue integration in orthopaedy , however , as collagen persistence was only temporary such efforts were limited. Adequate coverage with cell-derived ECM collagen-I would promise great success , in particular for TE of mechanically challenged tissues. Here , we have used label-free , non-invasive multiphoton microscopy ( MPM) to characterise bacterial nanocellulose ( BNC)- a promising biomaterial for bone TE- and their potency to stimulate collagen-I formation by mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs). BNC fleeces were investigated by Second Harmonic Generation ( SHG) imaging and by their characteristic autofluorescence ( AF) pattern , here described for the first time. Seeded MSCs adhered fast , tight and very stable , grew to multilayers and formed characteristic , wide-spread and long-lasting collagen-I. MSCs used micron-sized lacunae and cracks on the BNC surface as cell niches. Detailed analysis using a collagen-I specific binding protein revealed a highly ordered collagen network structure at the cell-material interface. In addition , we have evidence that BNC is able to stimulate MSCs towards osteogenic differentiation. These findings offer new options for the development of engineered tissue constructs based on BNC.
