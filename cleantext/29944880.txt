  Sarcopenia may be an indicator of frailty. We used total psoas area index ( TPAI) to identify sarcopenia and evaluated the effect of preoperative TPAI on outcomes following descending thoracic aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> ( DTAA) repair. DTAA patients between 2007-2015 undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair ( TEVAR) and open surgical repair ( OSR) with available preoperative imaging were analyzed. Sarcopenia was defined as TPAI < 6.5 cm 282/386 DTAA repairs had imaging available for TPAI measurements. 71/282 ( 25 %) underwent TEVAR and 211/282 ( 75 %) received OSR. Preoperative sarcopenia was similar in the 2 groups ( OSR: 57 % vs. TEVAR: 48 % , p = 0.188). Risk factors of sarcopenia were age > 70-year-old , female , and large body surface area , while heritable thoracic aortic disease was a protective factor. OSR patients with sarcopenia were older compared to patients without ( P < 0.001) , while TEVAR patients had similar age categorical distribution ( P = 0.187). Patients with sarcopenia had significantly increased adverse events compared to non-sarcopenia patients in both groups ( sarcopenia-TEVAR: 41 % vs. non-sarcopenia-TEVAR: 16 % , P = 0.020; sarcopenia-OSR: 49 % vs. non-sarcopenia-OSR: 32 % , P = 0.012). Determinants of long-term mortality were increasing age ( parameter estimate: 0.06 , P < 0.001) , TPAI as a decreasing linear function ( parameter estimate ( PE): 0.36 , P = 0.003) , OSR ( PE: 2.92 , P = 0.003) , and interaction between OSR and TPAI ( PE: -0.34 , P = 0.010). The interaction term showed that OSR increases long-term mortality risk in more sarcopenic patients. Preoperative sarcopenia significantly correlated with postoperative adverse events and long-term mortality following DTAA repair. If anatomically feasible , TEVAR should be considered in sarcopenic patients.
