  Concentrations and spatial variations of the four cations Na , K , Mg and Ca are known to some extent for groundwater and to a lesser extent for drinking water. Using Denmark as case , the purpose of this study was to analyze the spatial and temporal variations in the major cations in drinking water. The results will contribute to a better exposure estimation in future studies of the association between cations and diseases. Spatial and temporal variations and the association with aquifer types , were analyzed with spatial scan statistics , linear regression and a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression model. About 65,000 water samples of each cation ( 1980 ⁻ 2017) were included in the study. Results of mean concentrations were 31.4 mg/L , 3.5 mg/L , 12.1 mg/L and 84.5 mg/L for 1980 ⁻ 2017 for Na , K , Mg and Ca , respectively. An expected west-east trend in concentrations were confirmed , mainly explained by variations in aquifer types. The trend in concentration was stable for about 31 ⁻ 45 % of the public water supply areas. It is therefore recommended that the exposure estimate in future health related studies not only be based on a single mean value , but that temporal and spatial variations should also be included.
