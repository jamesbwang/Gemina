  Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is an essential pathway for energy production , especially during prolonged fasting and sub-maximal exercise. Long-chain fatty acids are the most abundant fatty acids in the human diet and in body stores , and more than 15 enzymes are involved in long-chain fatty acid oxidation. Pathogenic mutations in genes encoding these enzymes result in a long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder in which the energy homeostasis is compromised and long-chain acylcarnitines accumulate. Symptoms arise or exacerbate during catabolic situations , such as fasting , illness and ( endurance) exercise. The clinical spectrum is very heterogeneous , ranging from hypoketotic hypoglycemia , liver dysfunction , rhabdomyolysis , cardiomyopathy and early demise. With the introduction of several of the long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders ( lcFAOD) in newborn screening panels , also asymptomatic individuals with a lcFAOD are identified. However , despite early diagnosis and dietary therapy , a significant number of patients still develop symptoms emphasizing the need for individualized treatment strategies. This review aims to function as a comprehensive reference for clinical and laboratory findings for clinicians who are confronted with pediatric and adult patients with a possible diagnosis of a lcFAOD.
