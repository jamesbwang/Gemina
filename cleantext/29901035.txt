  A lack of access to safe drinking water can lead to adverse health effects such as infection , disease , and undesirable aesthetic problems. The current study focused on the investigation of groundwater quality in Tiran 's villages ( Isfahan province , Iran). To determine essential microbiological quality , water samples were collected from 46 randomly-selected water wells during a one-year period. The parameters of pH and chlorine were measured on-site. Turbidity was measured at 420 nm using a DR5000 spectrophotometer. Microbiological tests including general thermoforms ,
