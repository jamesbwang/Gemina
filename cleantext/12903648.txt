  This paper reviews computational modelling approaches to the learning of abstract concepts and words in embodied agents such as humanoid robots. This will include a discussion of the learning of abstract words such as ` use ' and ` make ' in humanoid robot experiments , and the acquisition of numerical concepts via gesture and finger counting strategies. The current approaches share a strong emphasis on embodied cognition aspects for the grounding of abstract concepts , and a continuum , rather than dichotomy , view of concrete/abstract concepts differences.This article is part of the theme issue ` Varieties of abstract concepts: development , use and representation in the brain '.
