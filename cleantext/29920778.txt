  The aim of this split-mouth study was to evaluate the masticatory efficiency in patients with segmentally reconstructed mandibles using free fibula flaps , with and without stabilizing osteosynthesis material in-situ during implant placement for rehabilitation with implant-supported removable partial dental prostheses ( ISRPDPs). Ten participants ( n = 10; ♀ = 2 , ♂ = 8; mean age = 38.1 years) consented to participate in this study. The participants ' normal side ( Side N) of the mandible served as the control side , for comparing the masticatory efficiency of the segmentally reconstructed and rehabilitated side ( Side R). Masticatory efficiency was evaluated using the two-colored chewing gum test , measured as subjective assessment ( SA) and electronically evaluated variance of hue ( VOH). Data were checked for normal distribution and statistically analyzed with the level of significance set to p < 0.05. Thirty-four tissue-level implants were placed in reconstructed mandibles of 10 participants. There was no significant difference observed in the masticatory efficiencies between Side N and Side R , in both subjective and electronic assessments. No implant loss was observed after a post-rehabilitated mean follow-up period of 42.7 months , revealing an implant survival rate of 100 %. In patients with surgically reconstructed mandibles , a normal masticatory function can be successfully achieved with a rehabilitation of the reconstructed side with implant-supported removable partial dental prostheses. Implant-supported prostheses should be actively advocated in patients with reconstructive surgeries to restore their masticatory function , extend their food choices , and improve their overall oral health-related quality of life.
