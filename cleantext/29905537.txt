  The research is based on the results of the examination and treatment of 156 patients who received treatment for extended benign esophageal strictures after corrosive injuries in the department of diseases of the esophagus and the gastrointestinal tract of the State Institution `` V. T. Zaitsev Institute of General and Urgent Surgery of NAMS of Ukraine '' for the period from 2000 to 2016. Surgical treatment by the developed in our hospital technique performed in the patients of the main group and the classical methods of surgery were used in the patients of comparison group. The developed in our clinic method of one-step transhital esophagogastroplasty with formation of a single anastomosis on the neck in patients with extended benign esophageal strictures after corrosive injuries in the state of compensation and subcompensation can be considered as a method of choice. Adequate preoperative verification of the type of extended damage by the cicatricial process of the upper part of digestive tract and the impossibility of eating in a natural way in the acute postburn period , as well as significant nutritive disorders in patients , provide the basis for two-step surgical treatment. This approach involves formation of gastrostomy at the first step for the restoration of trophological status of the patient and esophagoplasty at the second step. The two-step surgical treatment of patients with extended benign esophageal strictures after corrosive injuries with the formation of contact gastrostomy at first step and the implementation of esophagogastroplasty on the second step promotes improvement of treatment outcomes and life quality of the operated patients.
