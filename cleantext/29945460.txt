  The field of applied spectroscopy is strongly dominated by publications presenting proof-of-concepts , lab set-ups , and demonstrations. In contrast , the corresponding number of commercial successes of inline spectroscopy is surprisingly lower. This article discusses inline spectroscopy from an instrumentation perspective. It is the authors ' firm belief that the success of inline spectroscopy lies in the understanding of how the design and implementation of the optical instrumentation affects the data quality , and how this in turn will limit or enhance the performance of the prediction model. This article emphasizes the need for a strong , multidisciplinary design team , whose design process is rooted in first principles , to bridge the technology `` valley<disease> of death '' and convert research in applied spectroscopy into commercially successful solutions.
