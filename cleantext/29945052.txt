  Silver nanoparticles ( nanoAg) are effective antimicrobials and promising alternatives to traditional antibiotics. This study aimed at evaluating potency of different nanoAg against healthcare infections associated bacteria: Gram-negative Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Gram-positive Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> A library of differently coated nanoAg of two different sizes ( 10 and 50 nm) were prepared using coating agents poly-L-Lysine ( PLL) , cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide ( CTAB) , citrate ( CIT) , polyvinyl-pyrrolidone ( PVP) , polysorbate 80 ( Tween 80) , and dioctyl-sodium sulfosuccinate ( AOT). Stability evaluation by means of agglomeration and dissolution behaviour was performed for all nanoAg under conditions relevant for this study. Antibacterial properties of nanoAg were addressed by determining their minimal bactericidal concentrations ( MBC) in deionised ( DI) water to minimise the influence of silver speciation on its bioavailability.
