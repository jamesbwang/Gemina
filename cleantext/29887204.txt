  Human-driven environmental change has increased the occurrence of harmful cyanobacteria blooms in aquatic ecosystems. Concomitantly , exposure to microcystin ( MC) , a cyanobacterial toxin that can accumulate in animals , edible plants , and agricultural soils , has become a growing public health concern. For accurate estimation of health risks and timely monitoring , availability of reliable detection methods is imperative. Nonetheless , quantitative analysis of MCs in many types of biological and environmental samples has proven challenging because matrix interferences can hinder sample preparation and extraction procedures , leading to poor MC recovery. Herein , controlled experiments were conducted to enhance the use of ultra-performance liquid-chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry ( UPLC-MS/MS) to recover MC-LR and MC-RR at a range of concentrations in seafood ( fish) , vegetables ( lettuce) , and environmental ( soil) matrices. Although these experiments offer insight into detailed technical aspects of the MC homogenization and extraction process ( i.e. , sonication duration and centrifugation speed during homogenization; elution solvent to use during the final extraction) , they centered on identifying the best ( 1) solvent system to use during homogenization ( 2-3 tested per matrix) and ( 2) single-phase extraction ( SPE) column type ( 3 tested) to use for the final extraction. The best procedure consisted of the following , regardless of sample type: centrifugation speed = 4200 Ã— g; elution volume = 8 mL; elution solvent = 80 % methanol; and SPE column type = hydrophilic-lipophilic balance<symptom> ( HLB) , with carbon also being satisfactory for fish. For sonication , 2 min , 5 min , and 10 min were optimal for fish , lettuce , and soil matrices , respectively. Using the recommended HLB column , the solvent systems that led to the highest recovery of MCs were methanol: water: butanol for fish , methanol: water for lettuce , and EDTA-Na
