  Trace metals play a very important role on the performance and stability of agricultural biogas digesters. The purpose of this study was to develop a methodological approach to quickly detect limiting conditions due to Trace Elements ( TE) concentration in full-scale biogas plants. The work was based on long-term process monitoring in two full-scale agricultural biogas plants and on the correlation between their performance and TE concentration in the digesters. Monitoring and analysis of data from two different case studies allowed to understand the effect of the TE added on biogas plant performance. Furthermore , over-dosage has been avoided , minimizing the risk of biological inhibition and excess of heavy metal concentration in the effluent digestate according to regulation for land fertilization. TE supplementation has been successfully applied to optimize the biogas production , when a slight volatile organic acid accumulation has been detected ( from about 3515 mg CH
