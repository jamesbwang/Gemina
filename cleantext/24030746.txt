  Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , leg type ( PCDLBCL-LT) is one of the well-recognized extranodal lymphomas commonly addicted to the B-cell receptor-MYD88 superpathway. We aimed to describe the genomic changes in a patient who progressed through treatment with ibrutinib , a Bruton & rsquo; s tyrosine kinase ( BTK) inhibitor.
