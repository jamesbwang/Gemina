  Vertebral body ( VH) hemangiomas with myelopathy are difficult to manage. To evaluate the role of intra-operative ethanol embolization , surgical decompression and instrumented short segment fusion in VH with myelopathy and long-term outcome ( > 24 months). Prospective study: Symptomatic VH with cord compression with myelopathy. Excluded: pathological fractures , and/or deformity or multi-level pathologies. Surgery consisted of intra-operative bilateral pedicular absolute alcohol ( < 1 % hydrated ethyl alcohol) injection , laminectomy and cord decompression at the level of pathology followed by a short segment instrumented fusion using pedicle screws. 33 patients ( Mean 26.9 + 13.2 , range: 10-68 years , 18 females). myelopathy all ( 5 paraplegic) , sphincter involvement ( 13) , and mid back/ lower pain ( 7). Pre-operative American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA) scores: A ( 7) , B ( 11) , C ( 6) , D ( 8) and E ( 1). Majority had single vertebral involvement ( 30) , 3 multiple level. Six underwent surgery earlier ( 1 alcohol embolization here). Mean surgical time: 124 +39 minutes , average blood: 274 +80 cc. Mean amount of absolute alcohol injected: 14.6 +5.7 cc. ( 2 requiring 20 & 25 cc). Immediate embolization achieved in all , allowing laminectomy and soft-tissue hemangioma removal easily. Post-surgery , 1 patient had transient deterioration , rest all patients improved ( sphincters improved in 9) at a follow up ranging 28-103 months ( mean 47.6 +22.3). Follow-up ASIA scores: E ( 26) , D ( 4) , B ( 2) & C ( 1). All patients showed evidence of bone sclerosis and relief of cord compression on follow-up imaging. This is largest study in literature showing excellent improvement , low re-operation rates following ethanol embolization and short segment fixation.
