  Ascospheara apis is a widespread fungal pathogen that exclusively invades honeybee larvae. Thus far , non-coding RNA in A. apis has not yet been documented. In this study , we sequenced A. apis using strand specific cDNA library construction and Illumina RNA sequencing methods , and identified 379 lncRNAs , including antisense lncRNAs , lincRNAs , intronic lncRNAs and sense lncRNAs. Additionally , these lncRNAs were found to be shorter in length and have fewer exons and transcript isoforms than protein-coding genes , similar to those identified in mammals and plants. Furthermore , the existence of 15 predicted lncRNAs of A. apis was confirmed using RT-PCR and expression levels of 11 were lower than those of adjacent protein-coding genes. Our findings not only enlarge the lncRNA database for fungi<pathogen> , but also lay a foundation for further investigation of potential lncRNA-mediated regulation of genes in A. apis.
