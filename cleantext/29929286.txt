  Identifying and eliminating pollutant sources of water bodies is critical for drinking water safety. In this research , river water , reservoir water and groundwater samples ( n = 259) were collected from November 2015 to January 2017. Spatial Analysis was made of the isotopic compositions of potential nitrate sources ( i.e. , manure , sewage , chemical nitrogen fertilizer , soil organic nitrogen and rainfall) so as to obtain the site source isotopic signatures. Different sources pools and fractionation factors were loaded to a Bayesian isotope mixing model to ensure posterior estimates with less uncertainty. Results showed that the total nitrogen ( TN) concentrations in Hexi Reservoir watershed were higher than the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water of China ( GB 3838-2002) , and NO
