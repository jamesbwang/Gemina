  Web-based surveys have become increasingly popular but response rates are low and may be prone to selection bias. How people are invited to participate may impact response rates and needs further study as previous evidence is contradictory. The purpose of this study was to determine whether response to a web-based survey of healthcare workers would be higher with a posted or an emailed invitation. We also report results of the pilot study , which aims to estimate the percentage of adults vaccinated against influenza<disease> who report recurrent systemic adverse events ( the same systemic adverse event occurring successively following receipt of influenza<disease> vaccines). The pilot study was conducted in November 2016 in Toronto , Canada. Members of a registry of adults ( 18 years and older and predominantly healthcare workers) who volunteered to receive information regarding future studies about influenza<disease> were randomly assigned to receive either an email or postal invitation to complete a web-based survey regarding influenza<disease> vaccinations. Non-respondents received one reminder using the same mode of contact as their original invitation. The overall response rate was higher for those sent the invitation by email ( 34.8 %) than by post ( 25.8 %; p < 0.001) and for older versus younger participants ( p In this convenience sample of registry volunteers , response rates were generally low , but were higher for the emailed than posted invitations and for older than younger adults.
