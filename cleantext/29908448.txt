  Simple , selective and sensitive analytical devices are of a great importance for medical application. Herein , we developed highly selective immunosensor for electrochemical detection of C-reactive protein ( CRP) in blood sample. Branched polyethylenimine functionalized with ferrocene residues ( PEI-Fc) was the main element of the recognition layer , which allowed: ( i) covalent binding of an antibody in its most favorable orientation and ( ii) voltammetric detection of the C-reactive protein. Anchoring of PEI-Fc to the electrode surface through the electrodeposition process leads to the formation of thin , stable and reproducible layers , which is extremely important in the case of electrochemical immunosensing. The proposed analytical device is characterized by high selectivity and sensitivity and can be successfully used in the concentration range of CRP from 1 to 5 Â· 10
