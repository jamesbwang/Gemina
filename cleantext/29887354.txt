  In this work , we describe the preparation of some new Tacrine analogues modified with a pyranopyrazole moiety. A one-pot multicomponent reaction of 3-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5 ( 4H)- one , aryl ( or hetero) aldehydes , malononitrile and cyclohexanone involving a Friedl√§nder condensation led to the title compounds. The synthesized heterocyclic analogues of this molecule were evaluated in vitro for their AChE and BChE inhibitory activities in search for potent cholinesterase enzyme inhibitors. Most of the synthesized compounds displayed remarkable AChE inhibitory activities with IC
