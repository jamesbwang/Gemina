  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) is a global public health problem. Despite the major milestone in early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer , the prevalence of CRC rates is still rising. The etiology of CRC is still unknown but we know CRC is influenced by both of environment and genetic factors. In this study , we aimed to elucidate the role of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphic regions; FokI and TaqI single nucleotide polymorphisms , in increasing the risk of colorectal cancer in Birjand population. One hundred patients with CRC and 100 healthy controls recruited to the study. Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP ( restriction fragment length polymorphism) method technique for all individuals. There were statistically significant differences between ff genotype and f allele of FokI SNP in case and control groups. Our results manifested positive correlation between ff genotype and f allele of FokI SNP with colorectal cancer predisposition ( P = 0.035 , P = 0.0001 respectively) in South Khorasan population. The present study showed that FokI polymorphism but not TaqI polymorphism may contribute to CRC susceptibility. In addition , ff genotype of FokI polymorphism was associated with CRC risk.
