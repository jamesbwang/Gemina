  Worksite health promotion programs are emerging as an effective approach for addressing the adult obesity epidemic and improving the overall health of employees. We conducted a scoping review to identify articles that described a physical activity component ( eg , promoted increased physical or reduced sitting time) of a worksite health promotion intervention. Our search specified full-length articles published in English from January 2000 through July 2015. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Worksite Health ScoreCard , a validated tool , as a framework to summarize information on organizational supports strategies ( 18 questions) and physical activity strategies ( 9 questions) implemented by worksite health promotion programs. We also determined whether or not the included studies reported significant ( P < .05) improvements in physical activity. We identified 18 worksite health promotion programs; 11 produced significant improvements in physical activity. Incentives , health risk assessments , health promotion committees , leadership support , marketing , and subsidies or discounts for use of exercise facilities were the most effective organizational supports strategies cited , and physical activity seminars , classes , and workshops were the most effective physical activity strategies cited. The use of the Health ScoreCard allowed for a practical interpretation of our findings , which can inform next steps for the field. Future research should explore the relationships between components of worksite health promotion programs and their outcomes to further develop best practices that can improve worker health and promote physical activity.
