  It has been suggested that high cholesterol represents a risk factor for Graves ' orbitopathy ( GO). In a recent cross-sectional study , a correlation between cholesterol and the presence of GO was found in patients with a Graves ' disease ( GD) of recent onset. To confirm this observation , we conducted a retrospective investigation in consecutive patients with GD. The primary outcome was the relationship between the presence of GO and low-density lipoprotein ( LDL)- cholesterol. The design entailed the inclusion of consecutive patients with a GD of recent onset , with or without GO , who came to our observation to receive radioiodine over a period of 6 months , and a stratification aimed at having two homogeneous group of patients in terms of thyroid function. A total of 86 patients fulfilled the inclusion and evaded the exclusion criteria. All patients underwent an ophthalmological assessment and serum lipids were measured. Serum levels of LDL-cholesterol were significantly higher in patients with GO ( 135.3 ± 41.3 mg/dL) compared with those without GO ( 106.6 ± 23.9 mg/dL , P = 0.0007). In a similar manner , serum levels of total cholesterol were higher in patients with GO ( 211.6 ± 44.0 mg/dL) than in those without GO ( 176.0 ± 27.2 mg/dL , P = 0.0001). There was no relationship between GO severity and activity and cholesterol. There was no relationship between GO and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or triglycerides. Our study confirms a relationship between the presence of GO and cholesterol in patients with GD of recent onset. Whether lowering of cholesterol ameliorates , GO remains to be established.
