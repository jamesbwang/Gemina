  Co-production of polyhydroxyalkanoate ( PHA) and amino acids makes bacteria effective microbial cell factories by secreting amino acids outside while accumulating PHA granules inside. Poly ( 3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) ( PHBV) is one of the PHAs with biocompatibility and fine mechanical properties , but its production is limited by the low level of intracellular propionyl-CoA. L-Isoleucine producing Corynebacterium<pathogen> glutamicum strain WM001 were analyzed by genome and transcriptome sequencing. The results showed that the most over-expressed genes in WM001 are relevant not only to L-isoleucine production but also to propionyl-CoA accumulation. Compared to the wild-type C. glutamicum ATCC13869 , the transcriptional levels of the genes prpC2 , prpD2 , and prpB2 , which are key genes relevant to propionyl-CoA accumulation , increased 2 Genome and transcriptome analysis showed that C. glutamicum WM001 has potential to accumulate L-isoleucine and propionyl-CoA pool. This was experimentally confirmed by introducing the phaCAB gene cluster into WM001. The recombinant strain WM001/pDXW -8-phaCAB produced high levels of PHBV with high 3-hydroxyvalerate fraction as well as L-isoleucine. Because of its high level of intracellular propionyl-CoA pool , WM001 might be used for producing other propionyl-CoA derivatives.
