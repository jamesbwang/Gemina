  Close-packed structures of uniformly sized spheres are ubiquitous across diverse material systems including elements , micelles , and colloidal assemblies. However , the controlled access to a specific symmetry of self-assembled close-packed spherical particles has not been well established. We investigated the ordering of spherical block copolymer micelles in aqueous solutions that was induced by rapid temperature changes referred to as quenching. As a function of quench depth , the quenched self-assembled block copolymer micelles formed three different close-packed structures: face-centered cubic ( fcc) , random stacking of hexagonal-close-packed layers ( rhcp) , and hexagonal-close-packed ( hcp). The induced hcp and rhcp structures were stable for at least a few weeks when maintained at their quench temperatures , but heating or cooling these hcp and rhcp structures transformed both structures to fcc crystallites with coarsening of the crystal grains , which suggests that these noncubic close-packed structures are intermediate states. Time-resolved scattering experiments prove that the micellar rhcp structures do not originate from the rapid growth of competing close-packed structures. We speculate that the long-lived metastable hcp and rhcp structures originate from the small size of crystal grains , which introduces a nonnegligible Laplace pressure to the crystal domains. The reported transitions from the less stable hcp to the more stable rhcp and fcc are experimental observations of Ostwald 's rule manifesting the transition order of the key close-packed structures in the crystallization of close-packed uniform spheres.
