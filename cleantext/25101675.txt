  Reactive astrogliosis is a prominent and ubiquitous reaction of astrocytes to many types of brain injury. Up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP) expression and astroglial proliferation are hallmarks of reactive astrogliosis. However , the mechanisms that regulate reactive astrogliosis remain elusive. In the present study , status epilepticus ( SE , a prolonged seizure<symptom> activity) led to reactive astrogliosis showing the increases in GFAP expression and the number of proliferating astrocytes with prolonged extracellular signal receptor-activated kinases 1/2 ( ERK1/2) activation and reduced nuclear p27
