  Intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> is a considerable source of morbidity and mortality. This 3-center study describes outcomes of pediatric intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> and identifies 2-year neurological outcome predictors. Children 29 days to 18 years of age presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> from March 2007 to May 2015 were enrolled prospectively. Exclusion criteria included trauma; intracranial tumor; hemorrhagic transformation of arterial ischemic stroke or cerebral sinovenous thrombosis; isolated subdural , epidural , or subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom>; and abnormal baseline neurological function. Intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> and total brain volumes were measured on neuroimaging. The Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure assessed outcomes. Sixty-nine children were included ( median age: 9.7 years; interquartile range: 2.2-14). Six children ( 9 %) died during hospitalization. Outcomes in survivors were assessed at early follow-up in 98 % ( median 3.1 months; interquartile range: 3.1-3.8) and at later follow-up in 94 % ( median: 2.1 years; interquartile range: 1.3-2.8). Over a third had a significant disability at 2 years ( Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure > 2). Total Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure score improved over time ( Over one third of children experienced significant disability at 2 years. Improvements in outcomes were driven by recovery of sensorimotor function. Altered<symptom> mental<symptom> status<symptom> , hemorrhage<symptom> volume â‰¥ 4 % of total brain volume , and intensive care unit length of stay were independent predictors of significant disability at 2 years.
