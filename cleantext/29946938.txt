  The purpose of this study was to compare the rates of adjacent segment degeneration ( ASD) , sagittal alignment parameters , and patient-reported outcomes in patients who underwent multi-level versus single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( ACDF). A retrospective cohort analysis was performed on consecutive patients who underwent an ACDF. Pre- and post-operative radiographic assessment included ASD , change in C2-C7 lordosis , T1 angle , levels fused , sagittal vertical axis ( SVA) , fusion mass lordosis , proximal and distal adjacent segment lordosis. Patient-reported outcomes were obtained. Of the 404 that underwent an ACDF with a minimum of 6 months of follow-up ( average 28 months) , there was no significant difference in the rate of radiographic ASD overall ( p = 0.479) or in the proximal or distal adjacent segments on multivariate analysis. Secondarily , the multi-level fusions appear to restore significantly greater amounts of lordosis compared to single-level procedures ( p < 0.001) and are able to maintain the corrected cervical lordosis and fusion segment lordosis over time. From the immediate post-operative period to final follow-up , the single-level ACDFs show continuing lordosis improvement ( p = 0.005) that is significantly greater than that of the multi-level constructs. There were no significant differences between pre-operative , post-operative , or change in patient-reported outcomes. Two years following an ACDF , patients who underwent multi-level fusions appear to restore significantly greater amounts of lordosis compared to single-level procedures , while single-level ACDFs show significantly greater amounts of lordosis improvement over time. Multi-level procedures may not be at a significantly greater risk of developing early radiographic evidence of ASD compared to single-level procedure.
