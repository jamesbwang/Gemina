  The aim of this study was to further investigate the effect of drug loading , drug entrapment efficiency , the drug release profiles and biopharmaceutical point of views of amphotericin B ( AmB) lipid formulations , that is , degree of aggregation by UV-spectroscopy , in vitro hemolytic and antifungal activities. The optimum drug loading was 2.5 % by weight corresponded to lipid fraction in formulation. Increasing of the drug entrapment was achieved by blending small amount of phospholipid in solid lipid nanoparticle ( SLN) dispersions. All AmB lipid dispersions were less aggregated species and hemolytic response than Fungizone
