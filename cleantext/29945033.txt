  In this work , we systematically investigated the persulfate ( PS) activation potential of a series of nitrogen doped carbonaceous materials for the degradation of 2,4,4 '- trihydroxybenzophenone ( 2,4,4 '- HBP) , an additive in polyvinyl acetate films and personal care products. Nitrogen originating from urea , NH
