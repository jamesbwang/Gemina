Between 1975 and 2014 , 3752 donor nephrectomies ( DN) were performed at University of Minnesota; 167 ( 4.5 %) were > 60-years-old Short- and long-term outcomes were compared between contemporaneous > 60-years-old and < 60-years-old donors. On univariate analysis , > 60-years-old were more likely to have had prior abdominal surgery and hypertension; and less likely to smoke. Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) was lower in > 60-years-old ( 80 Â± 16 vs 101 Â± 26 mL/min/1 .73 m
