  An important emerging form of immunotherapy targeting B cell malignancies is chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) T cell therapy. Despite encouraging response rates of anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in B cell lymphomas , limited durability of response necessitates further study to potentiate CAR T cell efficacy. Antibody-targeted interferon ( IFN) therapy is a novel approach in immunotherapy. Given the ability of IFNs to promote T cell activation and survival , target cell recognition , and cytotoxicity , we asked whether antibody-targeted IFN could enhance the antitumor effects of anti-CD19 CAR T cells. We produced an anti-CD20-IFN fusion protein containing the potent type 1 IFN isoform alpha14 ( α14) , and demonstrated its ability to suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis of human<pathogen> B<pathogen> cell lymphomas. Indeed , with the combination of anti-CD20-hIFNα14 and CAR T cells , we found enhanced cell killing among B cell lymphoma lines. Importantly , for all cell lines pretreated with anti-CD20-hIFNα14 , the subsequent cytokine production by CAR T cells was markedly increased regardless of the degree of cell killing. Thus , several activities of CD19 CAR T cells were enhanced in the presence of anti-CD20-hIFNα14. These data suggest that antibody-targeted IFN may be an important novel approach to improving the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy.
