  To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/computed tomography ( F-FDG PET/CT) for lymph node ( LN) metastasis and the prognostic significance of F-FDG PET/CT LN parameters in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. Patients with resectable pancreatic cancer who underwent staging F-FDG PET/CT between May 2007 and September 2016 were retrospectively enrolled and analyzed through medical record and image re-evaluation. The diagnostic accuracy of F-FDG PET/CT in predicting LN metastasis was evaluated and compared with that of contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography ( CECT). Prognostic variables , including LN parameters assessed by F-FDG PET/CT ( standardized uptake value ( SUV) LN and LN/tumor SUV ratio) , that affect disease-free survival ( DFS) and overall survival ( OS) were evaluated by regression analysis. When predicting LN metastasis , F-FDG PET/CT showed greater sensitivity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , and accuracy than CECT. Among prognostic factors affecting DFS , PET-positive LN ( P = 0.008) , and LN/tumor SUV ratio ( P = 0.003) were found to be significant by regression analysis. Among the variables affecting OS , lymphovascular invasion ( P = 0.018) and the LN/tumor SUV ratio ( P = 0.046) were found to be significant. F-FDG PET/CT showed higher diagnostic accuracy in predicting LN metastasis than CECT in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. Only the LN/tumor SUV ratio of F-FDG PET/CT was an independent prognostic variable in both DFS and OS.
