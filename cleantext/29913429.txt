  Sucrose phosphate synthases ( SPSs) are rate-limiting sucrose synthesis enzymes present in photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues. The cucumber genome contains three SPSs that can be grouped into families A , B , and C. CsSPS1 and CsSPS2 are highly expressed in flowers and mature leaves , while the expression level of CsSPS4 increased gradually after leaf unfolding in our study and reached its peak after 20 days. In CsSPS4-overexpression tobacco plants , sucrose content and sucrose/starch ratio were increased significantly and resulted in improved leaf yield. By contrast , in CsSPS4-overexpression ( CsSPS4-OE) cucumber lines , contents of sucrose and starch were unchanged , and raffinose was increased in transgenic cucumber leaves. The expression of cucumber raffinose family oligosaccharide ( RFO)- synthesis-related genes increased obviously in cucumber CsSPS4-OE plants , and the sucrose , raffinose , and stachyose contents increased significantly in the petioles of CsSPS4-OE lines. In CsSPS4-antisense ( CsSPS4-A) cucumber lines , decreases occurred in mRNA expression , enzyme activity , sucrose content , sucrose/starch ratio , and stachyose transport , but the RFO-synthesis-related genes were nearly unchanged. Together , these results suggest that overexpression of CsSPS4 can lead to carbon metabolism prioritizing sugar transport in cucumber , and suppression of CsSPS4 likely promotes carbon metabolism to accumulate starch , showing a more complicated carbon distribution model than in transgenic tobacco plants.
