  Childhood adversity ( CA) has life-long effects that we are just beginning to understand. The Midlife in the United States ( MIDUS) data is a rich resource that could contribute to the knowledge of the impact of CA in the later years but , while a number of CA items are included in MIDUS , a cumulative CA scale based on those items has not been created. Development of a CA scale would create numerous research opportunities within MIDUS and overcome some of the challenges of using a secondary dataset. The present study aimed to demonstrate that a cumulative measure of CA that is valid with older adults could be created using retrospective MIDUS Refresher study data ( Ryff et al. , 2016); analysis included data collected from 2011 to 2014 from 2542 adults ages 23-76 ( 1017 adults 55-76). The present study provided a rationale for which measures of CA to include in a cumulative scale. The distribution of eight types of CA and the cumulative CA scale were consistent with findings from past studies of CA. The factor structure of the cumulative CA scale was similar to the original ACE study and included two factors: household dynamics and child abuse/neglect. Consistent with past studies , the CA scale predicted a negative association with life satisfaction and a positive association with number of chronic conditions. This study demonstrated that an effective cumulative measure of CA could be created that would be of value to other studies using MIDUS data to explore outcomes with older adults.
