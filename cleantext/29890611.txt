  Elevation is a complex environmental factor altering temperature , light , moisture and soil nutrient availability , and thus may affect plant growth and physiology. Such effects of elevation may also depend on seasons. Along an elevational gradient of the Balang Mountain , southwestern China , we sampled soil and 2-year old leaves , 2-year old shoots , stem sapwood and fine roots ( diameter < 5 mm) of Quercus aquifolioides at 2843 , 2978 , 3159 , 3327 , 3441 and 3589m a.s.l. in both summer and winter. In summer , the concentrations of tissue non-structural carbohydrates ( NSC) did not decrease with increasing elevation , suggesting that the carbon supply is sufficient for plant growth at high altitude in the growing season. The concentration of NSC in fine roots decreased with elevation in winter , and the mean concentration of NSC across tissues in a whole plant showed no significant difference between the two sampling seasons , suggesting that the direction of NSC reallocation among plant tissues changed with season. During the growing season , NSC transferred from leaves to other tissues , and in winter NSC stored in roots transferred from roots to aboveground tissues. Available soil N increased with elevation , but total N concentrations in plant tissues did not show any clear elevational pattern. Both available soil P and total P concentrations in all plant tissues decreased with increasing elevation. Thus , tissue N :P ratio increased with elevation , suggesting that P may become a limiting element for plant growth at high elevation. The present study suggests that the upper limit of Q. aquifolioides on Balang Mountain may be co-determined by winter root NSC storage and P availability. Our results contribute to better understanding of the mechanisms for plants ' upper limit formation.
