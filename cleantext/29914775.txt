  Recent data support the hypothesis that genetic damage occurring early in life during childhood can play an important role in the development of chronic<disease> diseases<disease> in adulthood , including cancer. The objective of this paper , part of the MAPEC_LIFE project , is to describe the frequency of micronuclei and meta-nuclear alterations in exfoliated buccal cells of 6-8year-old Italian children recruited in five Italian towns ( i.e. , Brescia , Torino , Pisa , Perugia and Lecce) with different air pollution levels. About 200 children per town were recruited from primary schools. Biological samples were collected twice from the same children , in two different seasons ( winter 2014-15 and late spring 2015). Cytogenetic damage was evaluated by the buccal micronucleus cytome assay. Overall , n = 1046 children represent the final cohort of the MAPEC_LIFE study. On the whole , the results showed a higher mean MN frequency in winter ( 0.42 ± 0.54 ‰) than late-spring ( 0.22 ± 0.34 ‰). MN frequency observed among the five Italian towns showed a trend that follows broadly the levels of air pollution in Italy: the highest MN frequency was observed in Brescia during both seasons , the lowest in Lecce ( winter) and Perugia ( late-spring). To the best of our knowledge , the number of recruited children included in the analysis ( n = 1046) is the highest compared to previous studies evaluating the frequency of MN in exfoliated buccal cells so far. MN frequency was associated with winter season and living in towns at various levels of air pollution , suggesting an important role of this exposure in determining early cytogenetic effects.
