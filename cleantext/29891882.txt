  A rare syndrome<disease> was first described in 1997 in a 17-year-old male patient presenting with Retinitis pigmentosa , HYpopituitarism , Nephronophthisis and Skeletal dysplasia ( RHYNS). In the single reported familial case , two brothers were affected , arguing for X-linked or recessive mode of inheritance. Up to now , the underlying genetic basis of RHYNS syndrome<disease> remains unknown. Here we applied whole-exome sequencing in the originally described family with RHYNS to identify compound heterozygous variants in the ciliary gene TMEM67. Sanger sequencing confirmed a paternally inherited nonsense c. 622A > T , p. ( Arg208 *) and a maternally inherited missense variant c. 1289A > G , p. ( Asp430Gly) , which perturbs the correct splicing of exon 13. Overall , TMEM67 showed one of the widest clinical continuum observed in ciliopathies ranging from early lethality to adults with liver fibrosis<disease>. Our findings extend the spectrum of phenotypes/syndromes resulting from biallelic TMEM67 variants to now eight distinguishable clinical conditions including RHYNS
