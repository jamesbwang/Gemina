  Dengue is the most important arboviral disease in the world. Seroprevalence has been proposed as a marker of endemicity , however , studies are scarce. We conducted a cross-sectional , stratified cluster , random sample study to measure the seroprevalence of antibodies to dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( DENV<pathogen>) in Mexico. The target population was school children ages 6-17 y from 22 endemic states in Mexico , clustered in four regions: Pacific , South-Central , Southeast and Low. A total of 2134 subjects provided blood samples for immunoglobulin G antibody detection in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Overall , the seroprevalence of antibodies against DENV was 33.5 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 27.5 to 40.1). The Southeast had the highest regional seroprevalence , reaching 70.9 % ( 95 % CI 60.3 to 79.7). Seroprevalence was higher in older children in the Southeast region: 62.1 % ( 95 % CI 46.9 to 75.2) in children 6-8 y and 82.6 % ( 95 % CI 73.8 to 88.9) in 13-17 years old ( y). However , this was not consistent in all regions. Seroprevalence was associated with dengue incidence. DENV<pathogen> seroprevalence in Mexico was found to be heterogeneous at the country , regional and state levels. Seroprevalence was linked to long-term exposure and did not adequately reflect recent patterns of transmission , suggesting that utilization of a single epidemiological indicator to define endemic regions should be avoided.
