  To compare the efficacy of experimental auriculotherapy and placebo auriculotherapy with sham points for the treatment of stress in nurses of a charity hospital in SÃ£o Paulo. Randomized , single-blind , controlled trial. The sample consisted of 168 nurses with medium and high stress levels according to the List of Stress Symptoms ( LSS). The participants were randomized to three groups: Auriculotherapy ( G1) , Placebo ( G2) and Control ( G3). Groups 1 and 2 received 12 sessions , twice a week. The points used in Group 1 were: Shenmen and Brainstem; in Group 2 the points were: External Ear and Face Area. The three groups were evaluated at baseline , after eight sessions , 12 sessions and in a follow-up ( after 15 days). Group 1 achieved a 43 % reduction and a 1.81 Cohen d index ( high effect) , presenting statistical difference after eight sessions , maintained in the follow-up evaluation ( p < 0.001) , according to Analysis of Variance. Group 2 achieved a 26 % reduction , with Cohen 's d index of 0.86 ( great effect) , achieving a difference after 12 sessions ( p < 0.001) , maintained in the follow-up ( p < 0.05). The G3 did not present stress reduction. Experimental auriculotherapy achieved greater stress reduction among nurses , but there was no statistical difference between the two intervention groups.
