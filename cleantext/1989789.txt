  The aim of this study is to measure the effect of positive-pressure ventilation on heart chamber dimensions , left ventricular ( LV) systolic function , LV diastolic function , right ventricular ( RV) systolic function , and RV pressure using transthoracic echocardiography. This is a prospective study in a single secondary health-care center. A total of 107 patients with obstructive sleep apnea on continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP) therapy were recruited as participants between April and September 2016. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed twice on each participant , before and 15 min after , they used their own CPAP machines , and the echocardiography parameters of both scans were compared. The parametric paired There were statistically significant reductions , after the application of CPAP , in the heart dimensions , and LV and RV systolic function. There were no significant changes in diastolic function. Concerning right heart<symptom> pressure<symptom> , with CPAP , there was a significant increase in the inferior vena cava ( IVC) diameter and there was also a significant decrease in IVC variability from 44.56 % ± 14.86 % to 36.12 % ± 11.42 %. The maximum velocity of tricuspid regurgitation ( TR) decreased significantly from 180.66 ± 6.95 cm/s to 142.30 ± 52.73 cm/s. Such changes were observed in both low and high CPAP subgroups. When placed on positive pressure , the clinically significant change in IVC diameter and variability and change in trans-TR velocity mean that it would be inaccurate to predict right heart chamber pressure through echocardiogram. Alternative methods for predicting right heart<symptom> pressure<symptom> are recommended.
