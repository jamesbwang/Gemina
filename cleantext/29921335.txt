  Rhinonyssids are obligate haematophagous mites that parasitize the nasal cavity of vertebrates , and occur in a wide range of birds worldwide. Two species of nasal mites are known to occur in penguins: Rhinonyssus sphenisci , which has been recorded from Humboldt and Magellanic penguins ( Spheniscus humboldti and S. magellanicus , respectively) , and Rhinonyssus schelli , which has been recorded in Adélie and Gentoo penguins ( Pygoscelis adeliae and P. papua , respectively). We examined the nasal cavity of African penguins ( Spheniscus demersus) that died while under care at a rehabilitation centre ( N = 40) or that were found dead at breeding colonies ( N = 67). Nasal mites were found in the nasal cavity and/or paranasal of sinuses of 21 penguins , some of which had signs of mild-to-moderate sinusitis<disease> Prevalence was higher in juveniles ( 29 %) and adults ( 27 %) than in chicks ( 10 %). Mean intensity was 5.9 ± 12.9 mites per infected host ( range 1-60). The mites presented morphological characteristics that were at times consistent with either R. sphenisci or R. schelli , and therefore we conservatively classified them as ` R. sphenisci sensu lato '. Our morphometric results raise the question of whether the specific status of R. schelli is justified.
