  Hyponatremia is common among elderly patients. This study aimed to examine the prognostic value of hyponatremia among elderly residents in a geriatric facility. We retrospectively examined the association between serum sodium levels and mortality among 118 residents ( 82 % female , mean age 85.5 years) in a single geriatric health service facility. We defined hyponatremia as Na < 135 mEq/L. On the basis of single measurements of serum sodium at periodic examinations , the patients were divided into hyponatremia and non-hyponatremia groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the effect of hyponatremia on mortality from May 2005 to April 2007. Thirty-three patients ( 28 %) had hyponatremia. Over a 1-year follow-up period , the cumulative survival rate was significantly lower in patients with hyponatremia than in those without hyponatremia. In a multivariate analysis , including traditional risk factors for death , hyponatremia was associated with an increased mortality risk ( adjusted hazard ratio 2.73; 95 % confidence interval 1.01-5.16; p = 0.047). Hyponatremia is common and is a predictor of mortality in the near future among very elderly residents of a geriatric facility.
