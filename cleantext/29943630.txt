  OBJECTIVE To compare the leak pressure and amount of time required to perform closure for 2 double-layer esophagotomy closure techniques. SAMPLE 28 intrathoracic esophageal segments harvested from 38 porcine cadavers. PROCEDURES Longitudinal 3-cm esophagotomy incisions made in porcine cadaveric esophagi were closed with 2 double-layer closure techniques. Fifteen incisions were closed with a simple interrupted pattern , and 13 incisions were closed with a simple continuous pattern. Leak pressure , bursting wall tension , and closure time were compared between suture patterns by use of a t test or Mann-Whitney rank sum test. RESULTS Median leak pressures differed significantly between segments closed with the simple interrupted pattern ( 16.0 mm Hg; range , 5.4 to 54.9 mm Hg) and the simple continuous pattern ( 38.7 mm Hg; range , 11.3 to 81.9 mm Hg). Median bursting wall tension differed significantly between the simple interrupted pattern ( 0.63 Ã— 10
