  With limited success achieved in bladder cancer patient management , novel agents are in urgent need for the purpose of therapy and prevention. As a sesquiterpenoid dimmer isolated from Gochnatia pomculat , (-)- gochnatiolide B has been bio-mimetically synthesized in multiple steps with a poor yield , which heavily limited the further research and clinical application. Herein , (-)- gochnatiolide B was synthesized beginning with dehydrocostuslactone in four steps with a total yield of 26 %. MTT assays showed that (-)- gochnatiolide B inhibited the growth of vast majority of human cancer cells especially bladder cancer cells. Mechanistically , (-)- gochnatiolide B induced the increased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and the decreased expression of anti-apoptosis proteins and further resulted in apoptosis of T24 cells. (-)- Gochnatiolide B induced G1 arrest which associated with SKP2 downregulation , leading to p27/Kip1 accumulation and downregulation of cyclin D1 in T24 cells. Furthermore , in vivo studies showed that (-)- gochnatiolide B remarkably inhibited tumor growth by 81 % compared with vehicle control. Taken together , (-)- gochnatiolide B exhibits inhibitory activity against bladder cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis , which suggests that (-)- gochnatiolide B could be an important candidate compound for prevention and treatment of bladder cancer.
