  Three dimensional inkjet printing of multiple materials for electronics applications are challenging due to the limited material availability , inconsistencies in layer thickness between dissimilar materials and the need to expose the printed tracks of metal nanoparticles to temperature above 100 °C for sintering. It is envisaged that instead of printing a dielectric and a conductive material on the same plane , by printing conductive tracks on an angled dielectric surface , the required number of silver layers and consequently , the exposure of the polymer to high temperature and the build time of the component can be significantly reduced. Conductive tracks printed with a fixed print height ( FH) showed significantly better resolution for all angles than the fixed slope ( FS) sample where the print height varied to maintain the slope length. The electrical resistance of the tracks remained under 10Ω up to 60 ° for FH; whereas for the FS samples , the resistance remained under 10Ω for samples up to 45 °. Thus by fixing the print height to 4 mm , precise tracks with low resistance can be printed at substrate angles up to 60 °. By adopting this approach , the build height `` Z '' can be quickly attained with less exposure of the polymer to high temperature.
