  Individuals with primary progressive aphasia<symptom> ( PPA) and their caregivers are at risk for decreased quality of life ( QoL) due to their progressive condition. Aphasia<symptom> camps are an intervention that can improve QoL , yet individuals with PPA are underrepresented at aphasia<symptom> camps relative to those with poststroke aphasia<symptom>. The purpose of this exploratory case study was to examine the effect of participation in aphasia<symptom> camp on the QoL of a couple impacted by PPA. The Living with Aphasia<symptom>: Framework for Outcome Measurement ( A-FROM) was used to guide a semistructured interview with an individual with PPA and her spouse , both of whom had attended the Alberta Aphasia Camp for 4 years. Conventional content analysis with an inductive approach was used to analyze results. Concepts that emerged from the interview were organized into pre-camp , during , and post-camp categories. Aspects of camp that had an effect on post-camp QoL for this couple with PPA included expanding social connections and introduction to new activities. Personal characteristics exhibited by the couple had an impact on their experience of aphasia<symptom> camp and how they incorporated their experiences into their everyday lives post-camp. Aphasia<symptom> camps are a participation-based service approach that can benefit people with aphasia<symptom> regardless of etiology. A consideration of personal factors of potential campers with PPA , and the provision of PPA-specific resources , is recommended for programs such as aphasia<symptom> camps that incorporate participants with mixed etiologies.
