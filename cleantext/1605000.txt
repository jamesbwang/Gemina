  To see effectiveness of the senior author 's repair technique for repair of large ( equal to or larger than 10 mm) bony lateral skull base defects. Retrospective. Secondary/tertiary care center. We performed retrospective review of 9 surgeries done in our institution between January 2010 and December 2013 for repair of large lateral bony skull base defects. We defined skull base defects extra-cranially and repaired them intra-cranially. We made an extracorporeal sandwich of autologous fascia-bone-fascia ( fascia lata<pathogen> and nasal septal bone) and sewed it together to make it into a unit-sandwich graft. This extracorporeally sewed unit-sandwich graft was then inserted to close the large skull base defects either via ( 1) a cranial slit-window , or ( 2) the skull base defect itself. Since skull base is bony , bony repair is preferred. Bone plates that are easily available for skull base repair are calvarial and nasal septal bone. Occasionally , harvest of split calvarial bone carries risk of major complications. We preferred nasal septal bone. Harvesting of septal bone even in children using a posterior incision should not disturb the cartilage growth centers. All nine patients were operated by this technique. We had four patients with cerebrospinal fluid leak , and five patients with brain herniation. All these patients had complete reversal of herniation of cranial contents and cessation of cerebrospinal fluid leak. On imaging , in 6 cases the bone graft remained in original intended position after 12 months of surgery. The bone graft was not identifiable in 3 cases. The senior author 's technique using autologous multi-layered graft is simple to master , repeatable and very effective.
