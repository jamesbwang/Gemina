  Retaliating against a threatening outgroup offers group members specific rewards , such as restored group esteem , a reduction in anger , and a sense of gratification. Because retaliation is rewarding , group members may appraise an attack on the outgroup to be beneficial , even if it feels physically painful. We hypothesized that group members would be more willing to endure pain to retaliate against a threatening outgroup , and that appraising the painful retaliation as rewarding would down-regulate their physiological stress response to pain. Participants were manipulated to feel threatened by a rival group and then completed the cold-pressor. During the cold-pressor , participants either retaliated against the outgroup or not. Results showed that retaliation inhibited physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> to pain , alleviated intergroup anger , and felt less aversive. We propose that these responses are caused by a cognitive reappraisal of pain , where painful retaliation is expected to be rewarding instead of threatening.
