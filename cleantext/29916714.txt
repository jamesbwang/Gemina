  Pigs with the Halothane ( HAL) or Rendement Napole ( RN) gene mutations demonstrate abnormal muscle energy metabolism patterns and produce meat with poor quality , classified as pale , soft , and exudative ( PSE) meat , but it is not well understood how HAL and RN mutations regulate glucose and energy metabolism in porcine muscle. To investigate the potential signaling pathways and phosphorylation events related to these mutations , muscle samples were collected from four genotypes of pigs , wild type , RN , HAL , and RN-HAL double mutations , and subjected to quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis using the TiO
