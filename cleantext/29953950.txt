  A growing body of research in elderly populations suggests that the early phase of an explosive muscle contraction ( i.e. , â‰¤ 200 ms) may be more functionally relevant than peak values. However , age-related variation in early phase explosive strength has never been investigated across the full-adult life span. This cross-sectional study investigated the age-related changes in the rate of power development ( RPD) and compared it to the changes in peak power ( P
