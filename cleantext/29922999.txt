  We studied the effect of chronic injections of serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine to rats during pregnancy on physiological and behavioral characteristics of female offspring during the prepubertal period. Fluoxetine reduced body<symptom> weight in newborn females , but this parameter was restored to normal values by the age of 25 days. Fluoxetine also increased animal anxiety<symptom> , but did not change the level of depressive behavior and cognitive capacities. It was shown that chronic injections of physiological solution to pregnant female enhanced nociceptive responses in the offspring during the prepubertal period , while fluoxetine neutralized the consequences of invasive intervention , which was expressed in a lower level of pain reaction in the offspring. This indicates the antinociceptive effect of fluoxetine.
