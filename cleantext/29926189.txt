  This study investigated the predictors associated with early recurrence ( i.e. within 12 months) after curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer ( GC). We evaluated the clinicopathological factors in 429 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy for GC without preoperative chemotherapy and analyzed these factors ' associations with early recurrence. Of 429 patients , 57 experienced recurrences , which were associated with gender , diameter , depth of invasion , lymph node ( LN) metastasis , the LN ratio ( LNr; LNs with metastasis/dissected LNs) , lymphatic invasion , vascular invasion , carbohydrate antigen 19-9 ( CA19-9) levels , C-reactive protein levels and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Twenty-one patients ( 36.8 %) recurred within 12 months. Early recurrence was associated with a high LNr ( P = 0.0020) and high CA19-9 levels ( P = 0.0415). The other factors were not significantly associated with early recurrence. The 12-month recurrence rate was 33.9 % in patients with a high LNr and 1.9 % in those with a low LNr and 20.3 % in patients with high CA19-9 levels and 3.5 % in those with low CA19-9 levels. The 12-month recurrence rate was 62.5 % in patients with a high LNr and high CA19-9 levels , 18.4 % in those with a high LNr or high-CA19-9 levels , and 1.4 % in those with a low LNr and low CA19-9 levels. LNr ≥ 0.15 and CA19-9 ≥ 37 U/ml were effective surrogate markers for predicting early recurrence.
