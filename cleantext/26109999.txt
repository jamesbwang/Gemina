  The herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus is a human pathogen which can cause skin or mucous membrane infections. Melissa , sumac , licorice , rosemary , and geranium have antimicrobial , antiviral , anti-inflammatory , and local analgesic effect. Shortening recovery period of recurrent herpes<disease> labialis and control of viral protein formation are the other effects of these herbs. The aim of this study is design , formulation , and evaluation of the gel containing extracts of these five herbs. In this experimental study after photochemical and macroscopic evaluation of these medicinal herbs , the semisolid concentrated extracts were incorporated in gel bases. Mucoadhesive gels were prepared using carbopol 940 , sodium carboxymethylcellulose ( Na CMC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose K4M as bioadhesive polymers. Physicochemical tests , viscosity , mucoadhesive strength measurement , and Polyphenol content of extracts mixture was measured 210.8 ± 13.68 mg GAE/g. pH of formulations was 6.0 ± 0.2. 14 gel formulations were prepared. Physical appearance , homogeneity , and consistency of F The best formulation for treatment and shortening recovery period of recurrent labial herpes<disease> infections should exhibit high value of mucoadhesion , show controlled release of drug.
