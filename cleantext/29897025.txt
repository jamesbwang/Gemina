  It is not yet established the advantages between amphotericin B lipid complex ( ABLC) and liposomal ( L-AmB) in patients with invasive fungal infections refractory to usual doses of conventional AmB ( d-AmB) , previous renal impairment , or unacceptable d-AmB renal toxicity. This systematic review aims to compare ABLC and L-AmB effectiveness and safety outcomes in these subgroups of patients. The search was performed on Medline , Cochrane Library , EMBASE , and LILACS databases. treatment comparing L-AmB with ABLC; patients who had ( i) refractory infection after being treated with d-AmB , ( ii) previous renal impairment , or ( iii) unacceptable d-AmB toxicity. Two investigators independently screened the search results , assessed trial quality , and extracted data. A total of 1,054 articles were identified in the literature. Among those , eleven were selected for full-text reading and five met the inclusion criteria. The five articles included reported on four separate observational studies. Overall , no significant difference was found in clinical relevant outcomes as new-onset dialysis , length of hospital stay , or mortality when comparing both lipid formulations. The studies reported a trend toward lower nephrotoxicity in patients treated with L-AmB. However , the results were imprecise and heterogeneous and the studies presented important methodological biases. The studies included in this systematic review pointed toward less nephrotoxicity events in the L-AmB group. However , due to low quality of evidence and no statistically significant differences in other clinical relevant outcomes , there is no definitive evidence of overall superiority in effectiveness or safety outcomes regarding one lipid formulation or another in this population subgroup.
