  SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells are susceptible to differentiation using retinoic acid ( RA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) , providing a model of neuronal differentiation. We compared SH-SY5Y cells proteome before and after RA/BDNF treatment using iTRAQ and phosphopeptide enrichment strategies. We identified 5587 proteins , 366 of them with differential abundance. Differentiated cells expressed proteins related to neuronal development , and , undifferentiated cells expressed proteins involved in cell proliferation. Interactive network covered focal adhesion , cytoskeleton dynamics and neurodegenerative diseases processes and regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase-related signaling pathways; key proteins involved in those processes might be explored as markers for neuronal differentiation.
