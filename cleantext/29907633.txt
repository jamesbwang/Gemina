  An Immunochip study recently identified the association of a number of new genetic loci with Behcet 's disease ( BD). To confirm the association between new genetic loci reported in an Immunochip study and BD in a Han Chinese population. A two-stage association study was carried out in 1238 patients with BD and 1458 healthy controls. Twenty-two candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) were selected for genotyping by iPLEXGold genotyping or TaqMan SNP assays and a meta-analysis was performed for significantly associated markers. The results showed that four SNPs ( Our findings confirmed the association of four loci (
