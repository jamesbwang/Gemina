  To verify factors associated with impact on Health-Related Quality of Life ( HRQoL) and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life ( OHRQoL) of children and adolescents with cerebral palsy ( CP). Sample of 149 individuals with CP aged 2 to 18 years and their caregivers , who provided information regarding HRQoL ( PedsQL 4.0) , OHRQoL ( PedsQL 3.0 Oral Health , and socioeconomic factors. A calibrated investigator performed dental examinations , with dental<disease> caries<disease> , traumatic dental injury , periodontal , and occlusal evaluation. HRQoL and OHRQoL scores were transformed into a 0 to 100 scale , dichotomized in absence or presence of impact ( score < 50) and analyzed by Mann-Whitney test and Poisson regression ( α = .05). The mean HRQoL score was 50.3 ± 10.2. Impact on HRQoL was observed in 51.7 % and associated with gender , general health perception , and communication skills. The mean OHRQoL score was 78.0 ± 24.6. The presence of impact on OHRQoL ( 12.1 %) was associated with age , presence of gastroesophageal reflux , dental<disease> caries<disease> , and periodontal<disease> diseases<disease>. Individuals with CP had low HRQoL and OHRQoL scores. The impact on HRQoL was shown to be associated with gender , health perception. and communication skills. Regarding OHRQoL , the presence of impact was associated with age , gastroesophageal reflux , dental<disease> caries<disease> and
