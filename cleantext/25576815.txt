  Metabolic engineering offers an exquisite capacity to produce new molecules in a renewable manner. However , most industrial applications have focused on only a small subset of elements from the periodic table , centered around carbon biochemistry. This review aims to illustrate the expanse of chemical elements that can currently ( and potentially) be integrated into useful products using cellular systems. Specifically , we describe recent advances in expanding the cellular scope to include the halogens , selenium and the metalloids , and a variety of metal incorporations. These examples range from small molecules , heteroatom-linked uncommon elements , and natural products to biomining and nanotechnology applications. Collectively , this review covers the promise of an expanded range of elemental incorporations and the future impacts it may have on biotechnology.
