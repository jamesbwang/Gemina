  The ultra-mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL) for treating low-volume renal nephrolithiasis is being used as an alternative modality to the conventional PCNL. However its use in the supine position has been scarcely reported. Patients who underwent ultra-mini PCNL in the supine position within the time frame of January 2017 to July 2017 were studied. All these patients had this as their first-line treatment. The patients had calculus limited to either a single calyx or just extending to the pelvis and the stone size was less than 2 cm in its maximal dimension. An 8.5 Fr operating nephroscope was used. The patients were positioned in the Galdakao modified Valdivia supine position. The stones were fragmented using Holmium-YAG laser. Various surgical outcomes including duration of the surgery , stone-free rate and any subsequent complications-if any-were analyzed. The study includes a series of 14 patients with 15 renal units ( one patient treated with bilateral renal stone disease). The mean age of the patients was 39.07 years and body mass index was 25.5 kg/m Ultra-mini PCNL in supine position with a complete tubeless approach for renal stone disease is a safe method for treating low-volume disease. Studies with a larger cohort may be required to finally validate this technique.
