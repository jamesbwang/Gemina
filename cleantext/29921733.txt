  Aromatase , a cytochrome P450 member , is a key enzyme involved in estrogen biosynthesis and is dysregulated in the majority of breast cancers. Studies have shown that lysine deacetylase inhibitors ( KDI) decrease aromatase expression in cancer cells , yet many unknowns remain regarding the mechanism by which this occurs. While advances have been made to clarify factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of the aromatase gene ( CYP19A1). Yet , despite aromatase being a primary target for breast cancer therapy , its post-translational regulation has been virtually unexplored. Acetylation is a post-translational modification ( PTM) known to alter the activity and stability of many oncoproteins and given the role of KDIs in regulating aromatase expression , we postulate that aromatase acetylation acts as a novel post-translational regulatory mechanism that impacts aromatase expression and/or activity in breast cancer. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS) analysis revealed that aromatase is basally acetylated on several lysine residues ( 108 , 242 , 262 , 334 , 352 and 354) in MCF-7 cells , and treatment with a SIRT-1 inhibitor induced additional acetylation ( 376 , 390 , 440 and 448). These acetylated lysine residues are in regions critical for aromatase activity. Site-directed mutagenesis and overexpression studies demonstrated that K108R/Q or K440R/Q mutations significantly altered aromatase activity in breast cancer cells without altering its subcellular localization. These findings demonstrate a novel post-translational regulation of aromatase and uncover novel anti-cancer effects of deacetylase inhibitors; thus , providing new insight for ongoing development of deacetylase inhibitors as cancer therapeutics.
