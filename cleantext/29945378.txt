  To illustrate the intrinsic dissolution rate ( IDR) involved in biopharmaceutics classification system of Chinese materia medica ( CMMBCS) , investigate the effect of artificial multicomponent environment on IDR of berberine , by using a non-disintegrating disk , and summarize related rules by using the obtained data. Progressive levels design was used to investigate the effects of single component environment ( puerarin , baicalin , and glycyrrhizic acid); double-component environment ( puerarin + baicalin , puerarin + glycyrrhizic acid , baicalin + glycyrrhizic acid); and triple-component environment ( puerarin + baicalin + glycyrrhizic acid) on IDR of berberine , laying a foundation for further researches on the absorption mechanism of multiple components.
