  Asthma-COPD overlap ( ACO) is heterogeneous in nature and requires a unified diagnostic approach. We investigated the urinary levels of l-histidine , a precursor of histamine related to inflammatory responses , as a new candidate biomarker for diagnosing this condition. We performed a prospective multicenter cohort study with retrospective analysis of 107 patients , who were divided into three groups: asthma , COPD , and ACO , according to the Spanish guidelines algorithm. Urinary l-histidine levels were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. High-resolution metabolomic analysis , coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and followed by multivariate statistical analysis , was performed on urine samples to discriminate between the metabolic profiles of the groups. Urinary l-histidine levels were significantly higher in patients with ACO than in those with asthma or COPD , but the subgroups of ACO , classified according to disease origin , did not differ significantly. High urinary l-histidine level was a significant factor for the diagnosis of ACO even after adjusting for age , sex , and smoking amount. Among patients with airflow obstruction , the urinary l-histidine levels were elevated in patients with a documented history of asthma before the age of 40 years or bronchodilator responsiveness ≥ 400 mL; bronchodilator responsiveness ≥ 200 mL of forced expiratory volume in 1 second and exceeding baseline values by 12 % on two or more visits; blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells · mm Urinary l-histidine could be a potential biomarker for ACO , regardless of the diversity of diagnostic definitions used.
