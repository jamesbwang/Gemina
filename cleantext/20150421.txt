  Mitochondrial Lon is a multi-function matrix protease with chaperone activity. However , little literature has been undertaken into detailed investigations on how Lon regulates apoptosis through its chaperone activity. Accumulating evidences indicate that various stresses induce transportation of p53 to mitochondria and activate apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner. Here we found that increased Lon interacts with p53 in mitochondrial matrix and restrains the apoptosis induced by p53 under oxidative stress by rescuing the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential ( Δψm) and the release of cytochrome C and SMAC/Diablo. Increased chaperone Lon hampers the transcription-dependent apoptotic function of p53 by reducing the mRNA expression of p53 target genes. The ATPase mutant ( K529R) of chaperone Lon decreases the interaction with p53 and fails to inhibit apoptosis. Furthermore , the chaperone activity of Lon is important for mitochondrial p53 accumulation in an mtHsp70-dependent manner , which is also important to prevent the cytosolic distribution of p53 from proteasome-dependent degradation. These results indicate that the chaperone activity of Lon is important to bind with mitochondrial p53 by which increased Lon suppresses the apoptotic function of p53 under oxidative stress. Furthermore , mitochondrial Lon-mtHsp70 increases the stability/level of p53 through trafficking and retaining p53 in mitochondrial matrix and preventing the pool of cytosolic p53 from proteasome-dependent degradation in vitro and in clinic.
