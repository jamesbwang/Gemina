  Many children are attracted to the color , noise , light , and excitement generated by fireworks. Both home and public displays of fireworks are a festive part of American culture , enjoyed on holidays , during sporting events , and on a variety of other occasions. However , fireworks pose a risk of serious injury to children and youth. Each year , thousands of children sustain major and minor injuries due to fireworks , with many resulting in permanent disability. Regulations concerning private sales and use of fireworks vary greatly from state to state , so children 's exposure varies geographically. Fortunately , by leaving fireworks to professionals , injuries to both adults and children can be prevented. ( Pediatr Ann. 2018; 47 ( 6): e227-e229.).
