  This case report describes a patient who experienced a recurrent ischemic stroke within 24 h. Dual-energy computed tomography ( DECT) angiography on admission showed 2 intracardiac thrombi , 1 in the left ventricle and 1 in the left atrial appendage. Following the second ischemic event , repeated DECT angiography showed that the ventricular thrombus had considerably diminished , suggesting that the recurrent brain infarction was caused by cardioembolism. This case emphasizes ( 1) the potential benefit of cardiac evaluation through CT angiography in the acute stroke setting , and ( 2) the use of DECT angiography for the detection of thrombus and the differentiation between thrombus , the myocardial wall , and a slow flow of contrast.
