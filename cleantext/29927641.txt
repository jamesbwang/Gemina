  To examine associations between patient factors and smoking cessation assistance in US safety-net clinics. Using electronic health record data from the OCHIN network , we identified adults with at least 1 primary care visit to a study clinic ( n = 143 clinics in 12 states) with at least 1 documented `` current smoker '' status during 2014 to 2016 ( n = 136314; 29.8 %). We estimated odds ratios ( ORs) of smoking cessation assistance receipt ( none ( reference) , counseling , medication , or both) by patient covariates. For all cessation assistance categories , odds of assistance were higher among women , those with more visits , those assessed and ready to quit , and patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hyperlipidemia. Odds of receiving both counseling and medication were lower among uninsured patients ( OR = 0.56; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.48 , 0.64) , those of a race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic White ( OR range = 0.65-0.82) , and those with diabetes ( OR = 0.85; 95 % CI = 0.79 , 0.92) , and higher among older patients and those with a comorbidity , with few exceptions. Disparities in smoking cessation assistance receipt exist in safety-net settings , in particular by health insurance coverage and across race/ethnicity , even after control for other socioeconomic and demographic factors.
