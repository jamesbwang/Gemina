  To analyze and characterize data about clinical outcome and complication rates in three-column osteotomies ( 3 CO) for treatment of rigid adult spine deformity ( ASD). Baseline and postoperative clinical outcomes , considering the Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI) and Scoliosis Research Society-22 ( SRS-22) questionnaires , radiographic parameters , and demographic data of patients who underwent 3 CO procedure for fixed ASD treatment were collected. Surgical characteristics and reports of perioperative complications were recorded , as well as those that occurred at a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Ten patients underwent 3 CO and had a minimum follow-up of 12 months ( mean 24 months). The patients showed significantly improved health-related quality of life scores ( ODI , SRS-22 total , function/activity , pain , and appearance). They also presented a significant improvement in all radiographic parameters considered in the study. Taking into account the surgical procedure , the operative time was significantly higher in patients with staged procedure than in patients with single-stage surgery ( Despite of the high complication rates , 3 CO was an effective technique , considering clinical and radiographic outcomes , to treat complex cases of rigid ASD in a sample of patients operated in a Brazilian spine center , with a minimum follow-up of 12 months.
