  Redox homeostasis is vital for cellular functions and to prevent the detrimental consequences of oxidative stress. Pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs) have an enhanced antioxidant system which supports the preservation of their genome. Besides , reactive oxygen species ( ROS) are proposed to be involved in both self-renewal maintenance and in differentiation in embryonic stem cells ( ESCs). Increasing evidence shows that cellular systems related to the oxidative stress defense decline along differentiation of PSCs. Although redox homeostasis has been extensively studied for many years , the knowledge about the transcriptional regulation of the genes involved in these systems is still limited. In this work , we studied Sod1 gene modulation by the PSCs fundamental transcription factors Oct4 , Sox2 and Nanog. We found that this gene , which is expressed in mouse ESCs ( mESCs) , was repressed when they were induced to differentiate. Accordingly , these factors induced Sod1 promoter activity in a trans-activation assay. Finally , Sod1 mRNA levels were reduced when Oct4 , Sox2 and Nanog were down-regulated by a shRNA approach in mESCs. Taken together , we found that PSCs ' key transcription factors are involved in the modulation of Sod1 gene , suggesting a relationship between the pluripotency core and redox homeostasis in these cells.
