  T3 is the biologically active thyroid hormone involved in glucose metabolism. The free T3 ( fT3)/ free T4 ( fT4) ratio , a marker indicating conversion of fT4 to fT3 , is also implicated in glucose homeostasis. To examine associations of fT3 and the fT3/fT4 ratio with gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM). In a case-control study , thyroid markers ( fT3 , fT4 , TSH) were measured and the fT3/fT4 ratio was derived across four visits in pregnancy , including first ( gestational weeks 10 to 14) and second ( weeks 15 to 26) trimester. Conditional logistic regression adjusting for thyroid autoimmunity status and major GDM risk factors estimated trimester-specific associations of thyroid markers with subsequent GDM risk. Twelve US clinical centers. One hundred seven GDM cases and 214 non-GDM controls from a multiracial pregnancy cohort of 2802 women. GDM diagnosis ascertained from medical records. Both fT3 and the fT3/fT4 ratio were positively associated with GDM: adjusted OR ( 95 % CI) comparing the highest vs lowest fT3 quartile was 4.25 ( 1.67 , 10.80) at the first trimester and 3.89 ( 1.50 , 10.10) at the second trimester. Similarly , the corresponding risk estimates for the fT3/fT4 ratio were 8.63 ( 2.87 , 26.00) and 13.60 ( 3.97 , 46.30) at the first and second trimester , respectively. Neither TSH nor fT4 was significantly associated with GDM. Higher fT3 levels , potentially resulting from de novo synthesis or increased fT4 to fT3 conversion , may be an indicator of GDM risk starting early in pregnancy.
