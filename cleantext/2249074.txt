  School Health Programme ( SHP) currently lacks effective implementation in Nigeria. Lack of training/orientation of teachers in the programme may have contributed to this. Developing an appropriate training intervention may require prior situation analysis to know teachers ' current level of training and involvement in the programme , as there is paucity of information on such study in Oyo State. Thus , this study was carried out to assess primary school teachers ' training and involvement in the SHP in Oyo state , Nigeria. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using a 2-stage cluster sampling method to select 2 out of the 33 Local Government Areas ( LGAs) in Oyo State. A semi-structured self-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information on respondents ' characteristics and previous training and involvement in the SHP. The major variable for assessing teachers ' involvement in the SHP was `` ever been involved in health inspection of pupils ''. Level of involvement was categorized into `` never , `` once '' , `` occasionally '' , `` frequently '' , and `` very regularly ''. These options were further re-categorized into `` never '' , `` infrequently '' ( once and occasionally) and `` frequently '' ( frequently and very regularly) for the purpose of inferential statistics. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Chi-square test at p = 0.05. A total of 811 respondents participated in the study. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents reported previous training in the SHP out of whom 44.7 % received the training on-the-job. Forty-seven percent were regularly involved in health inspection of pupils. Teachers who taught health education ( 92.3 %) were involved in health inspection of pupils compared with counterparts who did not ( 74.4 %) ( p < 0.001). Similarly , 85.3 % of teachers trained on-the-job were frequently involved in the SHP compared with 73.6 % of those trained during undergraduate years ( p = 0.026). Training and involvement of public primary school teachers in the SHP in Oyo State were suboptimal. Efforts at building the capacity of teachers through on-the-job training in SHP may be necessary to improving the current level of implementation in the State.
