  To assess the value of single nucleotide polymorphism array ( SNP array) for the study of fetuses with conotruncal defects ( CTD) detected by echocardiography. SNP array was carried out on 75 fetuses with sonographically detected CTD but a normal karyotype. The results were analyzed with ChAS software. Pathogenic CNVs were detected in 7 ( 9.3 %) of all cases. Variant of uncertain significance ( VOUS) was detected in 2 ( 2.7 %) cases. Benign CNVs were detected in 19 ( 25.3 %) cases. SNP array is an effective method for delineating the etiology of fetuses with CTD , particularly for those with a normal karyotype.
