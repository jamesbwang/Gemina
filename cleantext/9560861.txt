  Guidelines recommend stepped and collaborative care models ( SCM) for depression<symptom> We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a complex guideline-based SCM for depressed patients. German primary care units were cluster-randomised into intervention ( IG) or control group ( CG) ( 3:1 ratio). Adult routine care patients with PHQ-9 â‰¥ 5 points could participate and received SCM in IG and treatment as usual ( TAU) in CG. Primary outcome was change in PHQ-9 from baseline to 12 months ( hypothesis: greater reduction in IG). A linear mixed model was calculated with group as fixed effect and practice as random effect , controlling for baseline PHQ-9 ( intention-to-treat). 36 primary care units were randomised to IG and 13 to CG. 36 psychotherapists , 6 psychiatrists and 7 clinics participated in SCM. 737 patients were included ( IG: n = 569 vs. CG: n = 168); data were available for 60 % ( IG) and 64 % ( CG) after 12 months. IG showed 2.4 points greater reduction ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): -3.4 to -1.5 , p < 0.001; Cohen 's d = 0.45) ( adjusted PHQ-9 mean change). Odds of response ( odds ratio: 2.8; 95 % CI: 1.6 to 4.7) and remission ( odds ratio: 3.2; 95 % CI: 1.58 to 6.26) were higher in IG. Guideline-based SCM can improve depression<symptom> care.
