  This study investigated the synergistic effects of l-arginine and allopurinol on antioxidant and inflammatory mediators in human osteoblasts-osteoarthritis ( HOb-OA) cells. The cells were treated with allopurinol ( 50-150 mg/kg bwt) and l-arginine ( 50-150 mg/kg bwt) for 72 h. Cell viability , catalase , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , glutathione peroxidase ( Gpx) , reduced glutathione ( GSH) , lipid peroxidation , and the inflammatory markers interleukin 6 ( IL-6) , interleukin 1β ( IL-1β) , nuclear factor κB ( NF-κB) and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNF-α) were measured. The combined supplementation with allopurinol and l-arginine increased catalase , SOD , GSH , and Gpx , while it decreased lipid peroxidation , IL-6 , IL-1β , and TNF-α. While TNF-α , IL-6 , IL-1β , and NF-κB mRNA and protein expression were higher in control HOb-OA cells , the combined supplementation with allopurinol and l-arginine substantially reduced their expression in HOb-OA cells by > 40 %. In summary , combined supplementation with allopurinol and l-arginine might be very effective in osteoarthritis. A search for therapeutic agents that inhibit inflammation<symptom> could help to prevent and manage osteoarthritis. However , further studies need to determine the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of these agents in osteoarthritis.
