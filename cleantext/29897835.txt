  FUS ( fused in sarcoma<disease>) is an abundant , predominantly nuclear protein involved in RNA processing. Under various conditions , FUS functionally associates with RNA and other macromolecules to form distinct , reversible phase-separated liquid structures. Persistence of the phase-separated state and increased cytoplasmic localization are both hypothesized to predispose FUS to irreversible aggregation , which is a pathological hallmark of subtypes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. We previously showed that phosphorylation of FUS 's prionlike domain suppressed phase separation and toxic aggregation , proportionally to the number of added phosphates. However , phosphorylation of FUS 's prionlike domain was previously reported to promote its cytoplasmic localization , potentially favoring pathological behavior. Here we used mass spectrometry and human cell models to further identify phosphorylation sites within FUS 's prionlike domain , specifically following DNA-damaging stress. In total , 28 putative sites have been identified , about half of which are DNA-dependent protein kinase ( DNA-PK) consensus sites. Custom antibodies were developed to confirm the phosphorylation of two of these sites ( Ser-26 and Ser-30). Both sites were usually phosphorylated in a subpopulation of cellular FUS following a variety of DNA-damaging stresses but not necessarily equally or simultaneously. Importantly , we found DNA-PK-dependent multiphosphorylation of FUS 's prionlike domain does not cause cytoplasmic localization.
