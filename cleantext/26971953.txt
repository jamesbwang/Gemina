  In comparative studies of evolution of communication , the function and use of animal quiet calls have typically been understudied , despite that these signals are presumably under selection like other vocalizations , such as alarm calls. Here , we examine vocalization diversification of chimpanzee quiet ` hoos ' produced in three contexts-travel , rest and alert-and potential pressures promoting diversification. Previous playback and observational studies have suggested that the overarching function of chimpanzee hoos is to stay in contact with others , particularly bond partners. We conducted an acoustic analysis of hoos using audio recordings from wild chimpanzees (
