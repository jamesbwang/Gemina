  A randomized , multicenter , open-label study explored the effect of a fixed-dose ( FD) of plerixafor versus the approved weight-based ( WB) dose for the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs) in patients with non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma and a body<symptom> weight of ≤ 70 kg. After mobilization with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF) 10 μg/kg/day for 4 days , patients were randomized 1:1 to either plerixafor FD 20 mg ( n = 30) or WB 0.24 mg/kg ( n = 31) on the evening of Day 4. Co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving ≥ 5 × 10
