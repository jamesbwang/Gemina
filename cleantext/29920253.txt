  FtsZ proteins of the FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 families play important roles in the initiation and progression of plastid division in plants and green algae<pathogen>. Arabidopsis possesses a single FTSZ1 member and two FTSZ2 members , FTSZ2-1 and FTSZ2-2. The contribution of these to chloroplast division and partitioning has been mostly investigated in leaf mesophyll tissues. Here , we assessed the involvement of the three FtsZs in plastid division at earlier stages of chloroplast differentiation. To this end , we studied the effect of the absence of specific FtsZ proteins on plastids in the vegetative shoot apex , where the proplastid-to-chloroplast transition takes place. We found that the relative contribution of the two major leaf FtsZ isoforms , FtsZ1 and FtsZ2-1 , to the division process varies with cell lineage and position within the shoot apex. While FtsZ2-1 dominates division in the L1 and L3 layers of the shoot apical meristem ( SAM) , in the L2 layer , FtsZ1 and FtsZ2-1 contribute equally toward the process. Depletion of the third isoform , FtsZ2-2 , generally resulted in stronger effects in the shoot apex than those observed in mature leaves. The implications of these findings , along with additional observations made in this work , to our understanding of the mechanisms and regulation of plastid proliferation in the shoot apex are discussed.
