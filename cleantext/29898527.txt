  The dairy sector is recognised as one of the most impacting agricultural activities. In Italy approximately 24 % of cow 's milk is destined to Grana Padano , a Protected Designation of Origin long ripening cheese. The Grana Padano production has increased by 10 % in the last decade and approximately reached 183,000 t in 2015. Around 38 % of this production is exported to Germany , US , France and to the rest of the world. This study evaluated the environmental impact of production of Grana Padano , through a `` cradle to cheese factory gate '' Life Cycle Assessment. The study involved an Italian cheese factory that produces about 3.6 % of the total production of Grana Padano cheese and a group of 5 dairy farms , chosen among the farms that sold all milk produced to the cheese factory. The functional unit was 1 kg of Grana Padano cheese 12-month ripened. Environmental impacts of co-products: whey , cream , butter and buttermilk were also evaluated. Two sensitivity analyses were conducted: the first one had the aim to explore the effect of different allocation methods based on dry matter content , economic or nutritive value of cheese , respectively; the second one considered the variation of the impacts of milk<symptom> production<symptom> and its effect on cheese environmental impact. Milk<symptom> production<symptom> phase gave the most important contribution to the environmental impact of cheese , with a percentage of 93.5-99.6 % depending on the impact category. Excluding milk<symptom> production<symptom> from the system boundary , milk transport and use of electricity were the main responsible of the environmental impact of cheese-making process. The climate change impact for the production of 1 kg Grana Padano was 10.3 kg of CO
