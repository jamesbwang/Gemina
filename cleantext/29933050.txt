  The identification of Nocardia isolates still represents a challenge for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF MS) despite its acceptance for most bacterial and fungal isolates. In this study we evaluate the identification of Nocardia isolates using direct spotting and an updated database. Overall , 82 Nocardia<pathogen> isolates belonging to 13 species were identified by DNA sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA and secA1 genes. Nine of these well-characterized isolates from 6 Nocardia<pathogen> species were used to create an in-house library. The remaining 73 isolates were directly spotted on the target plate and on-plate protein extraction was performed. The protein spectra obtained were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS using the BDAL database ( Bruker Daltonics) updated with 6,903 MSPs or the combination of this commercial database and our in-house library. As a result , the use of the commercial database alone and in combination with the in-house library yielded 94.5 % and 95.9 % of correct species-level identifications , respectively , No isolate was misidentified at the genus level with either database. Besides , the use of the in-house library allowed the species-level identification of a N.<pathogen> otitidiscaviarum<pathogen> isolate that could only be identified at the genus-level with a score value < 1.6 using the commercial database. In conclusion , the implementation of the direct spotting method and the in-house database provided a high rate of correct species assignment of Nocardia isolates despite the low number of isolates added. Further addition of well-characterized Nocardia isolates may ensure the rapid , accurate and inexpensive identification of most isolates encountered in the routine of the microbiology laboratory.
