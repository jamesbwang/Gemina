  The gas-phase stabilities of the sandwich complexes formed by 12-crown-4 or 15-crown-5 with metal cations ( Na The sandwich complexes were generated in the gas phase by electrospray ionization ( ESI) and then they were subjected to the collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry experiments ( CID-MS/MS). On the basis of the obtained product ion spectra , the respective breakdown plots of the ion abundances ratios against collision energy expressed in the terms of center-of-mass were made. The gas-phase stabilities of ( ( B12C4) It is reasonable to assume that the cation-Ï€ interaction increases the stability of the sandwich complex of B12C4 with Tl
