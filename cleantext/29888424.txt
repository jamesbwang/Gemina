  Post-graduate education and continuous professional development ( CPD) within dietetics lack clearly defined pathways. The current literature primarily focuses on new graduate perceptions of workplace learning ( WPL). The present study raises issues of how CPD is sustained throughout a National Health Service ( NHS) career , how informal learning might be made more visible and whether the workplace withholds learning opportunities. Qualified dietitians participated in focus groups ( n = 32) and a nominal group technique ( n = 24). Data from audio recordings were transcribed and triangulated. Thematic analysis took an interpretative approach. One size for WPL for dietetics and , likely , other allied health professionals ( AHPs) did not meet the learning needs of everyone. The informal implicit learning affordances often went unrecognised. A greater emphasis on teaching , picking up on the strong preference for discussion with others voiced in the present study , may improve recognition of all WPL opportunities. Better scaffolding or guided support of entry level dietitians may ease the transition from study to workplace and challenge any perception of ` clipped wings '. Where development and career progression proves difficult for experienced dietitians , mentoring or stepping outside the NHS may revitalise by providing new communities of practice. WPL can not be understood as a unitary concept. Dietitians engage with WPL differently across their careers. Future visions<symptom> of WPL , especially explicit post-graduate career and education frameworks , must accommodate these differences to retain the highest calibre dietitians. The implications of a period of learning ` maintenance ' rather than CPD among experienced dietitians offers a topic for further research , particularly as the workforce ages.
