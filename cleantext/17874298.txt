  Obesity alters adipose tissue metabolic and endocrine functioning , leading to an increased adiposity and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Various phytochemicals have been reported to contribute to the beiging of white adipose tissue in order to ameliorate obesity by increasing thermogenesis. Here , we show that the prenylated chalcone , xanthohumol ( XN) , induces beiging of white adipocytes , stimulates lipolysis , and inhibits adipogenesis of murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes and primary human subcutaneous preadipocytes and these effects are partly mediated by the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK) signaling pathway. 3T3-L1 adipocytes and primary human subcutaneous preadipocytes were differentiated using a standard protocol and were treated with various concentrations of XN , dorsomorphin , an AMPK inhibitor , or AICAR , an AMPK activator , to investigate the effects on adipogenesis , beiging and lipolysis. XN induced beiging of white adipocytes as witnessed by the increased expression of beige markers CIDE-A and TBX-1. XN increased mitochondrial biogenesis , as evidenced by increased mitochondrial content , enhanced expression of PGC-1Î± , and the thermogenic protein UCP1. Following 24 h of treatment , XN also increased oxygen consumption rate. XN stimulated lipolysis of mature 3T3-L1 and primary human subcutaneous adipocytes and inhibited adipogenesis of maturing adipocytes. XN activated AMPK and in turn , XN-induced upregulation of UCP1 , p-ACC , HSL , and ATGL was downregulated in the presence of dorsomorphin. Likewise , an XN-induced decrease in adipogenesis was reversed in the presence of dorsomorphin. Taken together , XN demonstrates anti-obesity effects by not only inducing beiging but also decreasing adipogenesis and inducing lipolysis. The anti-obesity effects of XN are partly mediated by AMPK signaling pathway suggesting that XN may have potential therapeutic implications for obesity.
