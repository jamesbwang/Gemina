  Recently , a torque-measuring micromotor that calculates the integral ( I) of torque-depth curve at implant insertion was developed. This device was used to investigate the correlation between ( I) and mechanical stress in photoelastic resin blocks with the density of D1 bone. Using the micromotor , 40 implants ( 3.75 Ã— 12 mm) were placed in 40 D1 blocks that had been prepared in four different ways. Four groups of 10 blocks each were prepared according to tunnel length ( 12 or 14 mm) and debris removal ( yes or no). After insertion , peri-implant mechanical stress and its correlation with ( I) were assessed by photoelastic and linear regression analysis , respectively. Analysis of variance ( ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis tests investigated differences in mechanical stress patterns and dynamic parameters among the groups. ( I) significantly correlated with mechanical stress in D1 resin under all conditions , except for 12-mm implant sites still containing debris. The correlation was significant concerning the whole dataset ( r = 0.979) and separately for the coronal ( r = 0.940) , middle ( r = 0.964) , and apical ( r = 0.948) portions of the implants. Peak torque did not correlate significantly with peri-implant mechanical stress. Longer implant sites and debris removal were significantly associated with lower peri-implant mechanical stress. ( I) provides a reliable measure of mechanical stress in D1 bone during implant placement. Preparation of longer osteotomies and routine removal of all debris might reduce peri-implant bone stress significantly.
