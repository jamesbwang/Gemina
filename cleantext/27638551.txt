  This study analyzed the indications for conservative management of isolated greater tuberosity ( GT) fractures. The rate of secondary interventions for failed conservative treatment was also assessed. A retrospective data evaluation of isolated GT fractures was performed from the clinical database of two level-I trauma centers from January 2010 to June 2017. Conservatively treated GT fractures were identified and subdivided according to etiology , morphology , and amount of initial displacement. Secondary surgical interventions were recorded and subcategorized into fracture-associated interventions and interventions for associated soft tissue lesions<symptom>. We identified 114 fractures. Nine cases were excluded because patients refused surgery or their comorbidities ruled it out. Only two of the remaining 105 patients had an initial displacement > 3 mm. All other GT fractures ( Secondary interventions are required more frequently after shoulder dislocation. Surgery is most likely required for associated soft tissue lesions<symptom> rather than for secondary displacements. Thus , detailed physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging should be used to screen for concomitant soft tissue injuries accompanying GT fractures to prevent revision surgeries.
