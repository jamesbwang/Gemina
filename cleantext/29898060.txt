  X-ray microtomography ( microCT) is a nondestructive technique used to assess bone morphometry. For an accurate analysis , it is necessary to segment the bone tissue from the background images , avoiding under- or overestimation of the real bone volume. Thus , segmentation methods for microCT can influence the accuracy of bone morphometry analysis. The purpose of this study was to compare two different image segmentation methods available on microCT software ( subjective and objective) regarding to the human bone morphometric analysis. Sixteen samples containing a fixation screws covered by 0.5-1mm of bone were scanned using the SkyScan 1173 scanner. Three examiners segmented the microCT images subjectively and recorded the threshold values. Subsequently , an objective segmentation was also done. The 3D analysis was performed for both images using the values previously determined in CTAn software. Five bone morphometric parameters were calculated ( BV/TV , Tb.Th , Tb.N , Tb.Sp , Conn.Den) and used as dependent variables. ANOVA showed no significant differences between the methods concerning BV/TV ( p = 0.424) , Tb.N ( p = 0.672) , Tb.Th ( p = 0.183) , Tb.Sp ( p = 0.973) and Conn.Den ( p = 0.204). Intra- and interobserver agreement ranged from satisfactory to excellent ( 0.55-1 and 0.546-0.991 , respectively). Therefore , results obtained with subjective threshorlding were similar to those obtained with objective segmentation. Since objective segmentation does not have human input and it is a truly objective method , it should be the first choice in microCT studies that concern homogeneity and high resolution human bone sample.
