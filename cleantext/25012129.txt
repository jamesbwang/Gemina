  Canine neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs) in response to lipopolysaccharide but NETs from clinical septic dogs had not been identified. The primary aim is to describe the methodology of identifying and quantifying neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs) in cytology samples of septic foci in dogs with sepsis<pathogen> using immunofluorescence microscopy. Cytology samples including endotracheal tracheal wash ( ETW) , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL) , abdominal and pleural effusion<pathogen> collected from 5 dogs ( 3 septic , 2 non-septic) were fixed , permeabilized and stained for myeloperoxidase ( MPO) , citrullinated histone H3 ( citH3) and cell-free DNA ( cfDNA). Fluorescence microscopy was used to identify and quantify NETs in 10 random views at 40 Ã— magnification. NETs were identified based on co-localization of MPO , citH3 and cfDNA. NETs were quantified as a ratio ( number of NETs: number of neutrophils). Neutrophils were identified based on cytoplasmic MPO , cellular diameter and nuclear morphology. NETs were identified and quantified in all cytology samples collected from septic dogs. A small number of NETs was documented in one dog with sterile chronic bronchitis.<pathogen> No NETs were found in sterile abdominal effusion<pathogen> collected from one dog with congestive heart<pathogen> failure.<pathogen> Immunofluorescence microscopy could be a useful tool for the study of NETs in dogs with clinical
