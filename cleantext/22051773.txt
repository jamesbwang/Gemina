  BACKGROUND Aquaporin 4 ( AQP4) , the most abundant aquaporin in the brain , is a type of bidirectional water channel controlling the brain-water balance<symptom> and plays a critical role in physiologic and pathologic water balance<symptom> in the brain. AQP4 was reported to be elevated in hydrocephalus<symptom>; therefore , we hypothesized that AQP4 contributes to hydrocephalus<symptom>. In this study , the role of AQP4 in hydrocephalus<symptom> was explored. MATERIAL AND METHODS The hydrocephalus<symptom> rat model was established by injection of autologous blood. On Day 1 and Day 3 after injection of autologous blood , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) and hematoxylin-eosin ( HE) staining were performed to detect the changes in ventricles , and quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were carried out to detect the changes in AQP4 level. Thereafter , an AQP4-specific siRNA was used to downregulate AQP4. Then , on Day 3 after injection of autologous blood , the levels of AQP4 and connexin-43 were detected by qRT-PCR , immunohistochemistry , immunofluorescence , or Western blot analysis. MRI and HE staining were performed to detect the changes in ventricles , and Evans blue extravasation assay was used to assess blood-brain barrier integrity. RESULTS The hydrocephalus<symptom> rat model was established successfully , and hydrocephalus<symptom> rats showed a higher AQP4 level. Silencing AQP4 aggravated the hydrocephalus<symptom> , with enlarged lateral ventricles and destruction of ependymal integrity and blood-brain barrier. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that silencing AQP4 aggravates hydrocephalus<symptom> , indicating that AQP4 protects against
