  Parenthood is one of the most dramatic developmental transitions in the family life cycle. It requires profound changes in lifestyle , roles and relationships , can increase stress levels and affects both men and women 's quality of life. This study aimed to explore the effects on the health and well-being of parents during the first six months of transition to the parental role. A qualitative study using the grounded theory approach. Data collection was from semi-structured interviews ( total of 60 interviews). The constant comparative method was used and theoretical sampling in the process of data collection and analysis , and the study was undertaken in a simultaneous and cyclical way. Five fathers and five mothers ( couples) participated. The category `` living on the edge of one 's capacities '' was described , which is composed of the subcategories `` feeling exhaustion<symptom> '' , `` perceiving exhaustion<symptom> in the mother '' , `` overflowing emotions '' and `` feeling less exhaustion<symptom> '' , to explain the impact that the birth of a child had on the parents ' lives , when taking on all the tasks and responsibilities of parenthood. Adapting to parenthood is not easy , linear or fast. It involves numerous situations that generate stress and emotional disturbance , linked to tiredness , sleep disturbance , work overload and readjustments of the dynamics of life , which especially affect the mother. Antenatal and postnatal preparation for this impact should , therefore , be encouraged and effective , as a focus of nursing intervention.
