  This paper presents a fiber Bragg grating ( FBG) displacement sensor with high abrasion resistance for displacement monitoring of a steel spring floating slab damping track. A wedge-shaped sliding block and an equal-strength beam form a conversion mechanism to transfer displacement to the deflection of the beam , and the deflection-induced strain is exerted on two FBGs. A special linear guide rail-slider and a precision rolling bearing have been adopted onto the conversion mechanism , which turned sliding friction into rolling friction and thus significantly reduced the friction during frequent alternating displacement measuring. Sensing principle and the corresponding theoretical derivation have been demonstrated. Experiment results show that the sensor has a sensitivity of 34.32 pm/mm and a high resolution of 0.0029 mm within a measurement range of 0 ~ 90 mm. Besides , the sensor has also a good measurement capability for micro-displacement within a range of 0 ~ 3 mm. The repeatability error and hysteresis error are 1.416 % and 0.323 % , respectively. Good creep resistance and high abrasion resistance for alternating displacement measurement have also been presented by a performance test. These excellent performances satisfy the requirements of high precision and long-term stability in structural health monitoring for machinery equipment and civil engineering , especially in the displacement monitoring of a floating slab damping track.
