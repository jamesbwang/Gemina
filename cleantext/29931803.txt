  Emotional over-eating ( EOE) and emotional under-eating ( EUE) are common behaviours that develop in early childhood and are hypothesised to play a role in weight<symptom> status<symptom>. Data from a British twin cohort demonstrated that environmental , rather than genetic , factors shape individual differences in both behaviours in early childhood. The aim of this current study was to replicate this finding in a subsample ( n = 398) of 4-year-old twins selected for high or low risk of obesity from another population-based cohort of British twins ( the Twins Early Development Study). Parental ratings of child EOE and EUE were analysed using genetic model fitting. Genetic influence was not significant , while shared environmental factors explained 71 % ( 52-79 %) of the variance in EOE and 77 % ( 62-85 %) in EUE. The two behaviours correlated positively ( r = 0.53 , 95 % CI: 0.44 , 0.61) , and about two-thirds of the shared environmental factors influencing EOE and EUE were the same ( r Emotional eating in childhood is shaped by the home family environment; parents are therefore promising intervention targets.
