  Demonstration of coherent control and characterization of the control fidelity is important for the development of quantum architectures such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR). We introduce an experimental approach to realize universal quantum control , and benchmarking thereof , in zero-field NMR , an analog of conventional high-field NMR that features less-constrained spin dynamics. We design a composite pulse technique for both arbitrary one-spin rotations and a two-spin controlled-not ( CNOT) gate in a heteronuclear two-spin system at zero field , which experimentally demonstrates universal quantum control in such a system. Moreover , using quantum information-inspired randomized benchmarking and partial quantum process tomography , we evaluate the quality of the control , achieving single-spin control for
