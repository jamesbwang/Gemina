  Quantitative systems pharmacology ( QSP) models aim to describe mechanistically the pathophysiology of disease and predict the effects of therapies on that disease. For most drug development applications , it is important to predict not only the mean response to an intervention but also the distribution of responses , due to inter-patient variability. Given the necessary complexity of QSP models , and the sparsity of relevant human data , the parameters of QSP models are often not well determined. One approach to overcome these limitations is to develop alternative virtual patients ( VPs) and virtual populations ( Vpops) , which allow for the exploration of parametric uncertainty and reproduce inter-patient variability in response to perturbation. Here we evaluated approaches to improve the efficiency of generating Vpops. We aimed to generate Vpops without sacrificing diversity of the VPs ' pathophysiologies and phenotypes. To do this , we built upon a previously published approach ( Allen et al. , 2016) by ( a) incorporating alternative optimization algorithms ( genetic algorithm and Metropolis-Hastings) or alternatively ( b) augmenting the optimized objective function. Each method improved the baseline algorithm by requiring significantly fewer plausible patients ( precursors to VPs) to create a reasonable Vpop.
