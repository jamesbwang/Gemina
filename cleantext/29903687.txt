  The positive effects of behavioural treatment and weight management in adolescents with severe obesity are modest. Obesity surgery can be an option for adolescents , but is not the first-hand choice of treatment. The knowledge about adolescents ' own experiences of having undergone surgery and their thoughts and feelings of the follow-up period are limited. To describe adolescents ' decision to go through obesity surgery as teenager and their experiences of the follow-up period. National Childhood Obesity Centre at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm , Sweden. Phone interviews with 20 young adults that went through obesity surgery as teenagers. Interviews were analysed with qualitative systematic text condensation. `` Lost in the healthcare system '' and `` A rough but well worth journey to a healthier life '' were the categories that appeared in our analysis. The participant had a feeling of uncertainty about contacts with the healthcare system and the transition to primary care was confusing. Most of the participants were happy with the decision to go through obesity surgery as teenager , despite it had been a difficult time. Our results show implications for improving the clinical care of adolescents undergoing obesity surgery , which should be offered as a last choice. Information and individualized supports should be offered more often during first year postsurgery and should be given by a multidisciplinary team. This multifaceted population should be given priority for a successful transition.
