  While patients with early-stage rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS) have seen steady improvement in prognosis over the last 50 y , those with advanced-stage or high-grade disease continue to have a dismal prognosis. Retinoids have been shown to cause growth suppression and terminal differentiation in RMS cells , but the toxicities associated with retinoic acid limit its use. Rexinoids provide an alternative treatment approach to retinoic acid. Rexinoids primarily bind the retinoid X receptor with minimal retinoic acid receptor binding , the entity responsible for many of the toxicities of retinoid therapies. UAB30 is a novel rexinoid with limited toxicities. We hypothesized that UAB30 would lead to decreased cell survival in RMS. Two RMS cell lines , one embryonal ( RD) subtype<pathogen> and one alveolar ( St. Jude Cancer Research Hospital 30) subtype<pathogen> , were used. Cells were treated with UAB30 , and cytotoxicity , proliferation , mobility , and apoptosis were evaluated. UAB30 significantly decreased RMS tumor cell viability and proliferation. Invasion , migration , and attachment-independent growth were reduced following UAB30 treatment. UAB30 also resulted in apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest. UAB30 affected both the alveolar and embryonal RMS cell lines in a similar fashion. The results of these studies suggest a potential therapeutic role for the low-toxicity synthetic retinoid X receptor selective agonist , UAB30 , in RMS treatment.
