  Physical activity helps prevent excessive weight gain in youth. Few studies have examined regional variations in common activities , walking and bicycling. The primary aim was to examine participation in previous 7-day walking/bicycling for active transport and for fun/exercise by region , gender and age groups. Children ( n = 2693) from 130 diverse , geographically distributed US communities reported participation in previous 7-day walking/bicycling. Mixed model ANOVAs were used to compare walking/bicycling by region , gender and age groups using Healthy Communities Study data. Walking/bicycling for fun/exercise was higher in the Midwest , South and West compared with the Northeast , with the same regional patterns for boys , girls and 9-11-year olds. Walking/bicycling to non-school destinations was higher in the Midwest compared with the South and Northeast , with the same pattern for girls and 9-11-year olds. Walking/bicycling to school was higher Midwest , Northeast and West compared with the South , with similar patterns for girls and 12-15-year olds. Walking/bicycling for fun/exercise and to non-school destinations had higher prevalence than active transport to school. The Northeast reported lower walking/bicycling for fun/exercise; the South and Northeast reported lower walking/bicycling to non-school destinations. Program/policy initiatives should consider contextual demographic influences , as well as purpose/destination of walking/bicycling.
