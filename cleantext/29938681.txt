  Finding new markers with appropriate prognostic levels for the differential diagnosis of neoplastic diseases represents an important issue for biomedical research. Recently , latrophilin-1 ( LPHN1) was reported to be expressed in human monocytic leukemia<disease> cell lines and in primary human acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) cells. However , this expression was found to be absent in healthy leukocytes. LPHN1 was therefore considered a novel biomarker of human AML. In previous papers , we established two P-gp-positive variants ( SKM-1/ VCR and MOLM-13/ VCR) of AML cell lines derived from parental human AML cells SKM-1 and MOLM-13 by selection with VCR. The present paper addresses the measurement of LPHN1 expression in SKM-1 and MOLM-13 cells and their P-gp-positive variants. Both parental AML lines were positive for LPHN1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels. However , the expression of LPHN1 at both the mRNA and protein levels was reduced in both P-gp-positive SKM-1/ VCR and MOLM-13/ VCR variants of AML cells. Interestingly , we observed an elevation of the latrophilin-3 transcript in P-gp-positive variants of AML cell lines. The combined results suggest that alterations in latrophilin expression occur in AML cells expressing P-gp.
