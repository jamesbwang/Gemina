  To quantify the duration of each step of the diagnostic pathway for patients with multiple myeloma from symptom onset to confirmation of diagnosis. Systematic review and meta-analysis. The MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched up until January 2018 to identify articles that reported time intervals from onset of symptoms to diagnosis. Articles focusing on children or adolescents and on the asymptomatic form of the disease ( monoclonal gammopathies and smouldering myeloma) were excluded. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Weighted estimates of the median and IQR were calculated. Risk of bias was assessed using the Aarhus checklist. Nine studies were included. The patient interval ( first symptom to first presentation) had a median of 26.3 days ( IQR: 1-98 , n = 465 , two studies). Subsequently , the primary care interval ( first presentation to first referral) was 21.6 days ( IQR: 4.6-55.8 , n = 326 , two studies) , the diagnostic interval ( first presentation to diagnosis) was 108.6 days ( IQR: 33.3-241.7 , n = 5395 , seven studies) and the time to diagnosis ( first symptom to diagnosis) interval was 163 days ( IQR: 84-306 , n = 341 , one study). No studies reported data for the referral to diagnosis interval. The review demonstrates that there is scope for significant reductions in the time to myeloma diagnosis. At present , many patients experience a diagnostic interval longer than 3 months until diagnosis is confirmed. Not available. Protocol available in the appendix.
