  Atmospheric aerosol particles may contain light absorbing ( brown carbon , BrC) , triplet forming organic compounds that can sustain catalytic radical reactions and thus contribute to oxidative aerosol aging. We quantify UVA induced radical production initiated by imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde ( IC) , benzophenone ( BPh). and 4-benzoylbenzoic acid ( BBA) in the presence of the nonabsorbing organics citric acid ( CA) , shikimic acid ( SA) , and syringol ( Syr) at varying mixing ratios. We observed a maximum HO
