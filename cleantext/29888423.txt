  The objective was to assess the influence of pomegranate seed oil supplementation on the quality of fresh , cooled and frozen-thawed Arabian breed stallion semen. Eight stallions ( n = 4 per group) received their normal diet ( control group) or normal diet top dressed with 200 ml of pomegranate seed oil ( PSO group). Semen was collected every fifteen days for 90 days. Stallions were reversed across the treatments after a sixty-day interval. In cooled and stored condition ( 2 , 12 and 24 hr) , spermatozoa motion characteristics , membrane integrity , viability , morphology and lipid peroxidation were analysed. In frozen-thawed semen , sperm dynamic characteristics were analysed by CASA , acrosome status and mitochondrial activity ( evaluated by Flow cytometry) determined. The effects of treatment , time , semen type and their interactions were submitted to PROCMIX ( SAS
