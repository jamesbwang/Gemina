  We present a mouse virtual reality ( VR) system which restrains head-movements to horizontal rotations , compatible with multi-photon imaging. This system allows expression of the spatial navigation and neuronal firing patterns characteristic of real open arenas ( R). Comparing VR to R: place and grid , but not head-direction , cell firing had broader spatial tuning; place , but not grid , cell firing was more directional; theta frequency increased less with running speed , whereas increases in firing rates with running speed and place and grid cells ' theta phase precession were similar. These results suggest that the omni-directional place cell firing in R may require local-cues unavailable in VR , and that the scale of grid and place cell firing patterns , and theta frequency , reflect translational motion inferred from both virtual ( visual and proprioceptive) and real ( vestibular translation and extra-maze) cues. By contrast , firing rates and theta phase precession appear to reflect visual and proprioceptive cues alone.
