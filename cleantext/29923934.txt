  To investigate whether adenosine A2A receptors lead to vasodilation and positive inotropic function under stimulation and whether they play a role in the control of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in patients with cardiogenic shock<symptom>. Prospective observational study. Monocentric , Hopital Nord , Marseille , France. Patients with cardiogenic shock<symptom> ( n = 16) , acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( n = 16) , and acute myocardial infarction ( n = 16). None. Arterial adenosine plasma level and A2A receptor expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells were evaluated by mass spectrometry and Western blot , respectively , at admission and after 24 hours. Hemodynamic parameters , including systemic vascular resistance , were also assessed. Mean adenosine plasma level at admission was significantly higher in patients with cardiogenic shock<symptom> ( 2.74 ± 1.03 µM) versus acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 1.33 ± 0.27) or acute myocardial infarction ( 1.19 ± 0.27) ( normal range , 0.4-0.8 µM) ( p < 0.0001). No significant correlation was found between adenosine plasma level and systemic vascular resistance. Mean adenosine plasma level decreased significantly by 24 hours after admission in patients with cardiogenic shock<symptom> ( 2.74 ± 1.03 to 1.53 ± 0.68; p < 0.001). Mean A2A receptor expression was significantly lower in patients with cardiogenic shock<symptom> ( 1.18 ± 0.11) versus acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( 1.18 ± 0.11 vs 1.39 ± 0.08) ( p = 0.005). We observed high adenosine plasma level and low A2A receptor expression at admission in patients with cardiogenic shock<symptom> versus acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> or acute myocardial infarction. This may contribute to the physiopathology of cardiogenic
