  The purpose of the present study was to investigate distribution of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1) -2518 A/G and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) -634 G/C polymorphisms in type 2 diabetes melitus patients ( T2DM) presenting diabetic foot ulcer<disease> ( DFU). Additionally , we evaluated the effects of these 2 polymorphisms on serum levels of MCP-1 and VEGF in the study population.Patients diagnosed with T2DM without or with DFU were recruited in the study. The distribution of MCP-1 -2518 A/G and VEGF -634 G/C polymorphisms was investigated by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) was applied to detect the protein levels of MCP-1 and VEGF. The comparisons of protein levels in DFU patients were performed by student t test according to their genotypes.The frequencies of GG genotype and G allele of MCP-1 -2518 A/G was increased in DFU patients , compared with T2DM patients ( odds ratio ( OR) = 2.60 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.23-5.50 , P = .011 and OR = 1.72 , 95 % CI = 1.18-2.50 , P = .005 , respectively). Moreover , the increased frequency of GG was significantly associated with up-regulated MCP-1 level in DFU patients ( P < .001). Analysis for VEGF -634 G/C polymorphisms indicated that the prevalence of CC genotype and C allele of the polymorphisms was decreased in DFU patients , compared with T2DM patients ( OR = 0.36 , 95 % CI = 0.17-0.77 , P = .008 and OR = 0.63 , 95 % CI = 0.43-0.91 , P = .015 , respectively). DFU patients carrying CC genotype had a higher level of VEGF than those with other genotypes ( P = .007). MCP-1 -2518 A/G and VEGF -634 G/C polymorphisms may involve in occurrence and progress of DFU through regulating transcription activity of the genes.
