  The authors would like to submit two corrections on the recently published manuscript , Art of Cardiovascular Risk Assessment. In section 4 , the original sentence states: `` However , the SCCT does not recommend use of a CAC score in low-risk patients with an ASCVD risk of < 10 %. '' We would like to correct this to `` Furthermore , the SCCT recommends consideration of a CAC score in those with a risk score of 5-20 % and selectively in those with lower predicted risk who have a family history of premature ASCVD or other risk conditions.
