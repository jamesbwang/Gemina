  To investigate the expression of kir6 .2 subunit of the sarcKATP channel in exercise-induced myocardial injury and to elucidate the underlying mechanism of myocardial protection by sarcKATP channels. Healthy male Sprague Dawley ( SD) rats were divided into the Control ( C) and the Exhaustive Exercise ( EE) group. The one-time exhaustive exercise-induced myocardial injury model was established on a treadmill at a speed of 35 m/min. Alterations in myocardial ischemia and hypoxia were examined by hematoxylin-basic fuchsin-picric acid ( HBFP) staining and the concentration of cardiac Troponin I ( cTnl) , a sensitive and specific marker for myocardial injury , was detected using immunochemiluminescence analysis. The mRNA expression level , localization , and protein expression of sarcKATP channel subunit kir6 .2 were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) , immunofluorescence , and Western blot analysis , respectively. When compared to Group C , rats in Group EE demonstrated significantly increased areas of myocardial ischemia and hypoxia. Moreover , increased serum levels of cTnI were detected. Increased kir6 .2 expression was found on the surface of cardiomyocytes and kir6 .2 protein expression was also significantly increased. Exercise-induced myocardial injury did not result in noticeable alterations in kir6 .2 mRNA expression. However , kir6 .2 protein expression was significantly increased and resulted in increased numbers of sarcKATP channel openings in the myocardium , thereby further inhibiting exercise-induced myocardial injury.
