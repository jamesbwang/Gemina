  Atherosclerosis ( ATH) and coronary artery disease ( CAD) are chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> with an important genetic background; they derive from the cumulative effect of multiple common risk alleles , most of which are located in genomic noncoding regions. These complex<disease> diseases<disease> behave as nonlinear dynamical systems that show a high dependence on their initial conditions; thus , long-term predictions of disease progression are unreliable. One likely possibility is that the nonlinear nature of ATH could be dependent on nonlinear correlations in the structure of the human genome. In this review , we show how chaos theory analysis has highlighted genomic regions that have shared specific structural constraints , which could have a role in ATH progression. These regions were shown to be enriched with repetitive sequences of the
