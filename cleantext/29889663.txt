 : Antithrombin is a major suppressor of thrombin , factor Xa and blood coagulation. Inherited antithrombin deficiency is rare and is considered among the common causes of inherited thrombophilia. The relationship between antithrombin and IUGR , is questionable. The aim of this study was to trace the relationship between antithrombin deficiency and the intrauterine weight reduction and neonatal morbidity. The study was conducted on 55 full-term neonates ( including 25 baby boys and 30 baby girls) , all were admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in Cairo University Hospitals with IUGR; and another 110 healthy full-term neonates as control group. ATIII activities were assessed in citrated of patient and control samples automatically on coagulometer ( Stago , France). There was a highly significant relationship regarding ATIII deficiency in IUGR group in relation to control group ( P value < 0.001). In conclusion , we have identified antithrombin deficiency in Egyptian infants as an additional cause for low-birth weight and intrauterine growth retardation.
