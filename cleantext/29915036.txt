  Compact acceleration of a tightly collimated relativistic electron beam with high charge from a laser-plasma interaction has many unique applications. However , currently the well-known schemes , including laser wakefield acceleration from gases and vacuum laser acceleration from solids , often produce electron beams either with low charge or with large divergence angles. In this work , we report the generation of highly collimated electron beams with a divergence angle of a few degrees , nonthermal spectra peaked at the megaelectronvolt level , and extremely high charge ( âˆ¼ 100 nC) via a powerful subpicosecond laser pulse interacting with a solid target in grazing incidence. Particle-in-cell simulations illustrate a direct laser acceleration scenario , in which the self-filamentation is triggered in a large-scale near-critical-density plasma and electron bunches are accelerated periodically and collimated by the ultraintense electromagnetic field. The energy density of such electron beams in high-Z materials reaches to ( Formula: see text) , making it a promising tool to drive warm or even hot dense matter states.
