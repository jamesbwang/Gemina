  Various studies have assessed the association between E-cadherin methylation and risk of nasopharyngeal cancer ( NPC) but the conclusion remains unclear. This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of E-cadherin methylation on the incidence and clinicopathological characteristics of NPC. Ten studies published up to June 30 , 2016 , were collected. Odds ratios ( ORs) with corresponding confidence intervals ( CIs) were calculated and summarized , respectively. The E-cadherin methylation in NPC was significantly higher than those in normal groups ( OR 16.23; 95 % CI 8.34-31.60; P < .001). Ethnicity-stratified analysis indicated that E-cadherin methylation was strongly correlated with NPC among both Asians ( OR 16.98; 95 % CI 8.45-34.14; P < .001) and North Africans ( OR 10.67; 95 % CI 1.21-93.72; P = .033). However , further analysis showed that E-cadherin methylation was not strongly associated with clinicopathological feathers in patients with NPC. The E-cadherin methylation is strongly associated with the incidence of NPC , which can serve as an effective biomarker for early detection of NPC.
