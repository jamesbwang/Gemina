  In developing sensory systems , elaborate morphological connectivity between peripheral cells and first-order central neurons emerges via genetic programming before the onset of sensory activities. However , how the first-order central neurons acquire the capacity to interface with peripheral cells remains elusive. By making patch-clamp recordings from mouse brainstem slices , we found that a subset of neurons in the cochlear nuclei , the first central station to receive peripheral acoustic impulses , exhibits spontaneous firings ( SFs) as early as at birth , and the fraction of such neurons increases during the prehearing period. SFs are reduced but not eliminated by a cocktail of blockers for excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs , implicating the involvement of intrinsic pacemaker channels. Furthermore , we demonstrate that these intrinsic firings ( IFs) are largely driven by hyperpolarization- and cyclic nucleotide-gated channel ( HCN) mediated currents ( I
