  Greater extent of resection improves clinical outcomes in both high and low grade gliomas. However , in the age of new molecular markers , the impact of EOR may differ between molecular subtypes of these tumors. Here , we review the prior literature examining this variable impact of EOR amongst molecular subtypes of both high and low grade gliomas , and highlight gaps in our understanding that remain to be answered.
