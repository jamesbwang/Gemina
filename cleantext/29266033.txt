  The major histocompatibility complex class I and class II human leukocyte antigens ( HLA) play a central role in adaptive immunity but are also the dominant polymorphic proteins targeted in allograft rejection. Sensitized patients with high levels of panel-reactive anti-HLA antibody ( PRA) are at risk of early allograft injury , rejection , reduced allograft survival and often experience prolonged waiting times prior to transplantation. Xenotransplantation , using genetically modified porcine organs , offers a unique source of donor organs for these highly sensitized patients if the anti-HLA antibody , which places the allograft at risk , does not also enhance anti-pig antibody reactivity responsible for xenograft rejection. Recent improvements in xenotransplantation efficacy have occurred due to improved immune suppression , identification of additional xenogeneic glycans , and continued improvements in donor pig genetic modification. Genetically engineered pig cells , devoid of the known xenogeneic glycans , minimize human antibody reactivity in 90 % of human serum samples. For waitlisted patients , early comparisons of patient PRA and anti-pig antibody reactivity found no correlation suggesting that patients with high PRA levels were not at increased risk of xenograft rejection. Subsequent studies have found that some , but not all , highly sensitized patients express anti-HLA class I antibody which cross-reacts with swine leukocyte antigen ( SLA) class I proteins. Recent detailed antigen-specific analysis suggests that porcine-specific anti-SLA antibody from sensitized patients binds cross-reactive groups present in a limited subset of HLA antigens. This suggests that using modern genetic methods , a program to eliminate specific SLA alleles through donor genetic engineering or stringent donor selection is possible to minimize recipient antibody reactivity even for highly sensitized individuals.
