  Hirayama disease is a rare cervical myelopathy predominantly affecting young adults and mainly found in Asia. It results in a pure motor distal lesion<symptom> of the upper limbs with slow progression. Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) , which allows the diagnosis to be made , shows a typical appearance of anterior compression of the cervical spinal cord associated with enlargement of the posterior epidural spaces due to a dilated venous plexus. Surgery is considered when conservative treatment has failed. However , the type of surgery is not well standardized in this compressive myelopathy. We report on three patients with Hirayama disease operated using an original method: cervical decompressive laminectomy and coagulation of the posterior epidural plexus without fixation. The clinical , radiological and surgical data of these three patients were analyzed. Each patient underwent postoperative MR imaging. The mean age at diagnosis was 18.6 years ( 16-20 years) with a history of progressive<symptom> symptoms<symptom> lasting 1 to 4 years before treatment. Follow-up was 21 to 66 months after surgery. Neurological and electrophysiological improvement was noted in two patients; the third had stabilized. Postoperative MRI confirmed normalization of flexion imaging on MRI. None of the three patients complained of disabling neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. Posterior cervical decompression with coagulation of epidural venous plexus is a technique that seems effective in Hirayama disease in young subjects. It effectively treats patients by avoiding permanent cervical fixation.
