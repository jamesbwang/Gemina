  Novel nanocomposites of reduced graphene oxide ( rGO)- Fe3O4 , denoted as ` rGO: IO , and nitrogen doped rGO-ε-Fe3N , denoted as ` NrGO: IN ' , were prepared by a modified polyol method , wherein both the reduction of graphene oxide and oxidation of Fe2 +/ Fe3 + ions occurred simultaneously , followed by ammonia<pathogen> nitridation. The electron microscopy analysis of the rGO: IO and NrGO: IN nanocomposites revealed unique morphologies. In rGO: IO , the Fe3O4 nanoparticles having a mean diameter of 38 nm were found to be uniformly anchored to the rGO sheet surface , whereas in NrGO: IN , the ε-Fe3N nanoparticles ( ∼ 150 nm) were shielded by the NrGO sheets. Superparamagnetic and weak ferromagnetic characteristics with saturation magnetization values of 39.5 and 46 emu g-1 were observed in the rGO: IO and NrGO: IN nanocomposites respectively , which can be attributed to the nature of the constituent magnetic nanoparticles , Fe3O4 and ε-Fe3N. In addition , the graphene derivatives such as rGO and NrGO contributed to the enhanced electrical properties of the nanocomposite. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis showed that , compared to pure Fe3O4 and ε-Fe3N nanoparticles , the total electrical resistance of rGO: IO and NrGO: IN was reduced by 33344.8 and 1569.87 Ω cm-2 , respectively , when combined with the rGO and NrGO sheets. Further , the electromagnetic shielding performance of the NrGO: IN nanocomposite was investigated for the first time and was compared with the other samples. Of the two prepared nanocomposites , NrGO: IN exhibited electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of 35.33 dB at 11.4 GHz , which is considerably larger than that of rGO: IO ( 14.4 dB at 8 GHz). This enhanced shielding effectiveness is not only due to the high inherent magnetic and electrical properties of ε-Fe3N nanoparticles , but also due to the ` particle shielded by sheet ' morphology of the NrGO: IN , which enhances the charge accumulation at the heterogeneous interfaces of NrGO sheets/ε-Fe 3N nanoparticles.
