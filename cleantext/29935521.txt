  In the present contribution , we study dissociative electron attachment to 1-methyl-2-thiouracil that has been synthesized and purified prior to the measurements. We compare the results with those previously obtained from 2-thiouracil. The comparison of the yield of the dehydrogenated parent anion from both the compounds allows us to assign the site from which the H atom is expulsed and to predict the mechanism that is involved in the formation of the peaks within the ion yield curve. It appears that the dehydrogenation observed for 2-thiouracil arising from the vibrational Feshbach resonances ( at 0.7 and 1.0 eV) and a Ï€
