  Large numbers of children around the world are learning tone languages , but few studies have examined the acoustic properties of children 's early tone<symptom> productions<symptom>. Even more scarce are acquisition studies on tone sandhi , a tone change phenomenon which alters the surface realization of lexical tones<symptom>. Two studies using perceptual coding report the emergence of lexical tone and tone sandhi at around 2 years ( Li and Thompson , 1977; Hua and Dodd , 2000). However , the only acoustic study available shows that 3-year-olds are not yet adult-like in their lexical tone<symptom> productions<symptom> ( Wong , 2012). This raises questions about when children 's productions become acoustically adult-like and how their tone<symptom> productions<symptom> differ from those of adults. These questions were addressed in the current study which compared Mandarin-speaking pre-schoolers ' ( 3-5-year-olds) tone<symptom> productions<symptom> to that of adults. A picture naming task was used with disyllabic real words familiar to pre-schoolers. Overall children produced appropriate tone
