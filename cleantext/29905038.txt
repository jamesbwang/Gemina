  The aim was to determine the precision of a noninvasive near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS)- based tissue oximeter ( OxyPrem v1 .3). Using a linear mixed-effects model , we quantified the variability for cerebral tissue oxygenation ( StO2) measurements in 35 preterm neonates to be 2.64 % , a value that meets the often-articulated clinicians ' demand for a precise tissue oxygenation measurement. We showed that the variability of StO2 values measured was dominated by spontaneous systemic hemodynamic fluctuations during the measurement , meaning that precision of the instrument was actually even better. Based on simultaneous and continuous measurements of peripheral arterial oxygenation and cerebral StO2 with a second sensor , we were able to determine and quantify the physiological instability precisely. We presented different methods and analyses aiming at reducing this systematic physiological error of in vivo precision assessments. Using these methods , we estimated the precision of the OxyPrem tissue oximeter to be â‰¤ 1.85 %. With our study , we deliver relevant information to establish highly precise cerebral oxygenation measurements with NIRS-based oximetry , facilitating the further development toward a substantially improved diagnosis and treatment of patients with respect to brain oxygenation.
