  Avoidance of structural alerts ( SA) might reduce the risk of failure in drug discovery. However , there are still some marketed drugs containing SA , which indicates that SA should be analyzed carefully to avoid their excessive uses. Several detection systems , including automatic mining methods and expert systems , have been developed to identify SA. These methods only focus on toxic compounds that support the SA without consideration of non-toxic ones. Here , we proposed a frequency-based substructure detection protocol that learns from the non-toxic compounds containing SA to get non-toxic substructures ( NTS) , whose appearance will reduce the probability of a compound becoming toxic. Kazius and Hansen 's Ames<pathogen> mutagenicity data set was used as an example to demonstrate the protocol. SARpy and ToxAlerts were first employed to obtain the potential SA. Then two kinds of NTS were exploited: reverse effect substructures ( RES) and conjugate effect substructures ( CES). Contribution and prediction performance of the substructures were evaluated via neural network and rule-based methods. We also compared substructure-based methods with the conventional machine learning-based methods. The results demonstrated that most substructures contributed as supposed and substructure-based methods performed better in the resistance of overfitting. This work indicated that the protocol could effectively reduce the false positive rate in prediction of chemical mutagenicity , and possibly extend to other endpoints.
