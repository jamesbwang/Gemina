  To empirically test the hypothesis that the 10 roles on the Revised Role Checklist are represented in the International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health participation areas. Cross-sectional survey. Investigators from Japan , Norway , Sweden , Switzerland , the United Kingdom and the United States recruited a total of 295 adults from the general population. There were 103 ( 34.9 %) male and 191 ( 64.7 %) female participants with one participant not indicating gender. The age distribution of participants was from < 25 ( n = 68) to 75 + with a mode of 25-34 years. The Revised Role Checklist Part 1 was used to assess perceived incumbency in 10 roles. In addition , subjects were asked to provide role examples. Of the 7087 examples provided by participants , 6578 ( 92.8 %) fit the original hypothesis that the roles in the Revised Role Checklist were covered in participation areas. Fit was determined when the role example was either named in the associated International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health participation area or when the criteria of: `` does this example conceivably fit in the respective area as ` a person 's involvement in life situations ' fit relative to each role. '' Slight modification of the scope of three roles of the original hypothesis resulted in a 97.6 % match. The roles in the Revised Role Checklist are well represented in the International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health categories of participation.
