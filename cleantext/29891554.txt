  Chitinases and chitinase-like proteins are an evolutionary conserved group of proteins. In the absence of chitin synthesis in mammals , the conserved presence of chitinases suggests their roles in physiology and immunity , but experimental evidence to prove these roles is scarce. Chitotriosidase ( chit1) is one of the two true chitinases present in mammals and the most prevalent chitinase in humans. In this study , we investigated the regulation and the role of chit1 in a mouse model of
