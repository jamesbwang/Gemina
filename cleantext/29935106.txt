  Naturally occurring quercetin has been found to induce mitophagy and prevent nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD). However , it still remains elusive whether frataxin upregulation by quercetin contributes to the beneficial effect through mitophagy or not. Adult male C57BL/J mice were fed a high-fat diet ( HFD , 60 % of energy from fat) with quercetin ( 100 mg kg Quercetin alleviated hepatic steatosis by enhancing frataxin-mediated PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy , highlighting a promising preventive strategy and mechanism for NAFLD by quercetin.
