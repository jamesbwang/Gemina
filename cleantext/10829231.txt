  Introduction of point mutations to a gene of interest is a powerful tool when determining protein function. CRISPR-mediated genome editing allows for more efficient transfer of a desired mutation into a wide range of model organisms. Traditionally , PCR amplification and DNA sequencing is used to determine if isolates contain the intended mutation. However , mutation efficiency is highly variable , potentially making sequencing costly and time consuming. To more efficiently screen for correct transformants , we have identified restriction enzymes sites that encode for two identical amino acids or one or two stop codons. We used CRISPR to introduce these restriction sites directly upstream of the
