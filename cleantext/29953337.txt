  The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the application of calcium silicate materials ( CSMs) , after acid etching , on the longevity of the hybrid layer and marginal adaptation of composite restorations. Eighty human permanent molars received an intrapulpal pressure of 15 cm H Application of CSMs improved the marginal adaptation values in both adhesive groups. In group 1 , there were areas of incomplete penetration of resins along with evidence of partial degradation of resin tags. Samples receiving CSM application after acid etching demonstrated long and regular resin tags with very few signs of degradation. Application of CSMs after acid etching can be a potential avenue in preserving the resin-dentin bonds.
