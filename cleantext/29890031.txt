  Plant molecular farming offers a cost-effective and scalable approach to the expression of recombinant proteins which has been proposed as an alternative to conventional production platforms for developing countries. In recent years , numerous proofs of concept have established that plants can produce biologically active recombinant proteins and immunologically relevant vaccine antigens that are comparable to those made in conventional expression systems. Driving many of these advances is the remarkable plasticity of the plant proteome which enables extensive engineering of the host cell , as well as the development of improved expression vectors facilitating higher levels of protein production. To date , the only plant-derived viral glycoprotein to be tested in humans is the influenza<disease> haemagglutinin which expresses at ~ 50 mg/kg. However , many other viral glycoproteins that have potential as vaccine immunogens only accumulate at low levels in planta. A critical consideration for the production of many of these proteins in heterologous expression systems is the complexity of post-translational modifications , such as control of folding , glycosylation and disulphide bridging , which is required to reproduce the native glycoprotein structure. In this review , we will address potential shortcomings of plant expression systems and discuss strategies to optimally exploit the technology for the production of immunologically relevant and structurally authentic glycoproteins for use as vaccine immunogens.
