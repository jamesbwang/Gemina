  Animal African trypanosomosis ( AAT) , a disease affecting livestock , is caused by parasites of the Trypanosoma genus ( mainly T. vivax<disease> and T. congolense). AAT is widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa , where it continues to impose a heavy socio-economic burden as it renders development of sustainable livestock rearing very strenuous. Active case-finding and the identification of infected animals prior to initiation of drug treatment requires the availability of sensitive and specific diagnostic tests. In this paper , we describe the development of two heterologous sandwich assay formats ( ELISA and LFA) for T. congolense detection through the use of Nanobodies ( Nbs). The immunisation of an alpaca with a secretome mix from two T. congolense strains resulted in the identification of a Nb pair ( Nb44/Nb42) that specifically targets the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. We demonstrate that the Nb44/Nb42 ELISA and LFA can be employed to detect parasitaemia in plasma samples from experimentally infected mice and cattle and , additionally , that they can serve as ` test-of-cure ' tools. Altogether , the findings in this paper present the development and evaluation of the first Nb-based antigen detection LFA to identify active T. congolense infections.
