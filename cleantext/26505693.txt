  Both field and experimental evolution studies have demonstrated that organisms naturally or artificially exposed to environmental oncogenic factors can , sometimes rapidly , evolve specific adaptations to cope with pollutants and their adverse effects on fitness. Although numerous pollutants are mutagenic and carcinogenic , little attention has been given to exploring the extent to which adaptations displayed by organisms living in oncogenic environments could inspire novel cancer treatments , through mimicking the processes allowing these organisms to prevent or limit malignant progression. Building on a substantial knowledge base from the literature , we here present and discuss this progressive and promising research direction , advocating closer collaboration between the fields of medicine , ecology , and evolution in the war against cancer.
