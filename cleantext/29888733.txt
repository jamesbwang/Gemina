  Type II enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma ( Type II EATL) is a rare peripheral T-cell lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract. Here , we report a case of Type II EATL , in which the patient with repeated diarrhea<disease> was diagnosed as ulcerative colitis<disease> and amebic infection at the beginning , but her symptom had no improvement after therapy. The diagnosis of Type II EATL was confirmed by the repeated biopsies and immunohistochemistry. This case suggests that Type II EATL is difficult to diagnose due to lack of specific symptoms and endoscopic features. It reminds us that for patients with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes and thickened bowel wall , lymphoma should be highly suspected and biopsy should be repeated if necessary.
