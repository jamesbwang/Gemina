  Physical activity ( PA) is recommended by osteoarthritis ( OA) international organizations as an essential component of first-line management of knee OA. Primary care physicians ( PCP) and rheumatologists can play a key role in promoting PA but the extent that PA recommendation is occurring in primary and rheumatology care is unclear. This review provides an overview of current practice of PCP- and rheumatology-delivered PA intervention in the United States , Canada and Europe for the management of knee OA and explores barriers to implementing PA intervention in primary and rheumatology care. A search of MEDLINE from 2000-April 2017 was conducted , 848 abstracts were identified from which 22 relevant articles were selected for this review. Overall , recommendation of PA is suboptimal- the majority of studies reported that < 50 % of PCPs and rheumatologists make this recommendation to people with knee OA. Key barriers identified were time constraints , lack of patient motivation , PA-specific resources and financial reimbursement , concerns about inadequate training and knowledge for detailed exercise prescription and beliefs about the efficacy of exercise in the management of OA and their role in providing PA intervention. There is a sparsity of data about rheumatology practice and barriers to PA intervention among this group. In summary , this review suggests that there is a notable gap between what clinical guidelines recommend and what is happening in clinical practice. Addressing this practice gap through addressing key barriers provides an opportunity for improving OA care and ultimately , the health and quality of life of people with OA.
