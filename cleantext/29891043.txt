  This study aimed to determine whether erythropoietin could repair glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head after the systemic or local administration of recombinant human erythropoietin. Gelatin microspheres were used to load recombinant human erythropoietin for local delivery. Forty-eight Wistar rats were included in the glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head model and randomly divided into the placebo , systemic erythropoietin and local erythropoietin groups. Eight weeks later , all rats were killed and their tissues were subjected to radiographic , histological , histometric , quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. Our results show that the use of recombinant human erythropoietin increased bone volume , trabecular number , trabecular thickness and trabecular separation compared with the placebo. Erythropoietin administration significantly improved the expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 , alkaline phosphates , hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor in the femoral head. We also found that the local injection of erythropoietin could better mediate hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-controlled osteogenic and angiogenic factor expression and better repair the glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The use of recombinant human erythropoietin exerted effects on improving the bone structures in glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head and up-regulated the expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 , alkaline phosphates , hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor. It provided a novel idea that erythropoietin administration could repair glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head by improving bone formation and angiogenesis and may be associated with the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α pathway. The sequential delivery of erythropoietin from gelatin microspheres seems worth recommending.
