  The sweet potato leaf folder , Brachmia macroscopa Meyrick ( Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) , which is a significant pest of plants in the family Convolvulaceae , is rapidly expanding its range in South China and other subtropical regions. Studies were designed to examine the effects of three different host plants ( sweet potato , Ipomoea batatas ( L.) Lam.; water spinach , I. aquatica<pathogen> Forsskål; and morning glory , Pharbitis purpurea ( L.)) on the development and life table parameters of B. macroscopa under laboratory conditions. We found that the intrinsic rates of increase of B. macroscopa were 0.17 ± 0.004 , 0.21 ± 0.005 and 0.16 ± 0.004 on I. batatas , I. aquatica<pathogen> and P. purpurea , respectively. The highest net reproduction rate was 158.06 ± 18.22 per female reared on I. aquatica<pathogen>. The larvae had five instars when reared on I. batatas and I. aquatica<pathogen> , but required six instars on P. purpurea. The mean generation lengths of B. macroscopa ranged from 24.32 ± 0.18 days when reared on I. aquatica<pathogen> to 29.40 ± 0.24 days on P. purpurea. The survival of all stage and fecundity curves was intuitively manipulated using the age-stage-structured and two-sex population life table method , to enable comprehensive descriptions of the stage and population trends of B. macroscopa on the three Convolvulaceae plants. Our results indicated that I. batatas and I. aquatica<pathogen> were more suitable host plants than P. purpurea.
