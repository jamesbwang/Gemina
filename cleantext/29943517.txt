  The aim of the present study was to examine the risk factors for developing diabetes after 3 years in an elderly Chinese suburban population with impaired fasting glucose ( IFG). The study population comprised residents of the Hangu area of Tianjin , China , with IFG , aged ≥ 60 years , who joined the national free physical examination program ( n = 328; mean ( ± SD) age 68.0 ± 6.1 years; 48.2 % men). Diabetes was defined by self-report of a physician 's diagnosis or fasting plasma glucose ( FPG) ≥ 7.0 mmol/L; IFG was defined as FPG ≥ 5.6 and < 7.0 mmol/L. Risk factors of incident diabetes at the 3-year follow-up were analyzed individually using logistic regression analysis. Between baseline and the 3-year follow-up , 56 subjects with IFG at baseline had developed diabetes. After multivariate adjustment for demographic and clinical factors , the incidence of diabetes increased with higher FPG ( odds ratio ( OR) 9.30 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 2.84-30.48) , but decreased with the grip strength/weight ratio ( OR 0.88 , 95 % CI 0.82-0.94). Moreover , the combination of higher FPG and lower grip strength/weight was associated with a higher incidence of diabetes than higher FPG only or lower grip strength/weight ( P < 0.05). The present study indicates that higher FPG and lower muscle strength are associated with glycemic deterioration among subjects with IFG after 3 years. The results suggest that not only glucose levels , but also physical performance may be useful markers of the risk of diabetes in this population.
