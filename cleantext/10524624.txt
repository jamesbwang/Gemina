  Aberrant attentional biases to social stimuli have been implicated in a number of disorders including autism and social anxiety<symptom> disorder. Oxytocin , a naturally-occurring mammalian hormone and neuromodulator involved in regulating social behavior , has been proposed to impact basic biological systems that facilitate the detection of and orientation to social information. Here , we investigate a role for naturally-occurring variability in the endogenous oxytocinergic system in regulating neural response during attention to social information. Participants performed a selective social attention task while undergoing fMRI , provided a blood sample for epigenetic analysis , and completed self-report measures of social functioning. We find that a functional epigenetic modification to the oxytocin receptor , OXTR methylation , is associated with increased neural response within and decreased functional coupling between regions of the salience and attentional control networks during selective social attention. We also show that subclinical variability in autistic and social anxiety<symptom> traits moderates this epigenetic regulation of neural response. These data offer a mechanistic explanation to a growing literature associating social behavior and disorder with epigenetic modification to OXTR by suggesting that OXTR methylation reflects a decrease in the extent to which social information automatically captures attention. We highlight the importance that treatment efficacy be considered in relation to individual differences in molecular makeup , and that future studies aimed at uncovering biomarkers of disorder carefully consider measurement at both the biological and phenotypic level.
