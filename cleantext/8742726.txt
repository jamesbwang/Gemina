  X-ray computed tomography has been studied in various fields. Considerable effort has been focused on reconstructing the projection image set from a rigid-type specimen. However , reconstruction of images projected from an object showing elastic motion has received minimal attention. In this paper , a mathematical solution to reconstructing the projection image set obtained from an object with specific elastic motions-periodically , regularly , and elliptically expanded or contracted specimens-is proposed. To reconstruct the projection image set from expanded or contracted specimens , methods are presented for detection of the sample 's motion modes , mathematical rescaling of pixel values , and conversion of the projection angle for a common layer.
