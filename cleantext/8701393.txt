  The risk of thromboembolic events during pregnancy in patients with antithrombin deficiency is increased. Preventing thromboembolic events during pregnancy in the case of antithrombin deficiency is still a matter of concern. We present a case of a 19-year-old primigravida Greek Pomak woman , who was diagnosed as having congenital antithrombin deficiency. She had a history of recurrent miscarriages and a family history of thrombosis. She was managed with adjusted doses of low molecular weight heparin throughout her pregnancy , with regular anti-Xa and antithrombin level monitoring. Prior to delivery and for 4 days after delivery she received human antithrombin III concentrate. She delivered a small for gestational age baby with no other complications. She required an increased dose of heparin due to heparin resistance. Antithrombin deficiency is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolic events with a 50 % risk of thromboembolic events before the 50th year of life. It is a rare condition , so data concerning the optimal management during pregnancy are limited. The selection of patients who should receive low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis as well as dose intensity and monitoring are discussed. In our patient a conventional low molecular weight heparin dose proved to be inadequate at least at the laboratory level.
