  N-acetylcysteine , a precursor molecule of glutathione , is an antioxidant. Ketamine , a pediatric anesthetic , has been implicated in cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity including modulation of monoaminergic systems in mammals and zebrafish. Here , we show that N-acetylcysteine prevents ketamine 's adverse effects on development and monoaminergic neurons in zebrafish embryos. The effects of ketamine and N-acetylcysteine alone or in combination were measured on the heart rate , body length , brain serotonergic neurons and tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive ( TH-IR) neurons. In the absence of N-acetylcysteine , a concentration of ketamine that produces an internal embryo exposure level comparable to human anesthetic plasma concentrations significantly reduced heart rate and body length and those effects were prevented by N-acetylcysteine co-treatment. Ketamine also reduced the areas occupied by serotonergic neurons in the brain , whereas N-acetylcysteine co-exposure counteracted this effect. TH-IR neurons in the embryo brain and TH-IR cells in the trunk were significantly reduced with ketamine treatment , but not in the presence of N-acetylcysteine. In our continued search for compounds that can prevent ketamine toxicity , this study using specific endpoints of developmental toxicity , cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity , demonstrates protective effects of N-acetylcysteine against ketamine 's adverse effects. This is the first study that shows the protective effects of N-acetylcysteine on ketamine-induced developmental defects of monoaminergic neurons as observed in a whole organism.
