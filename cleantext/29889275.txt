  Myopericytoma is an emerging class of neoplasm originating from the perivascular myoid cellular environment , previously classified as a variant of hemangiopericytoma. Most reported myopericytomas are found in soft tissues of the extremities; however , infrequent cases are described involving the central nervous system. Intracranial myopericytoma remains rare. Here , we describe the first report of myopericytoma occurring at the cervicomedullary junction in close proximity to the vertebral artery , mimicking a vascular lesion<symptom>. A 64-yr-old woman presented with radiating neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-circumscribed enhancing lesion<symptom> adjacent to the vertebral artery-accessory nerve complex. She underwent a far lateral craniotomy and cervical laminectomy to obtain proximal vertebral artery control and adequate exposure of the lesion<symptom> , which appeared most consistent with neoplasm at surgery. Histopathology revealed a grade I myopericytoma. A gross total resection was achieved , and the patient has no evidence of recurrence 3 yr after surgery. Tumors of perivascular origin include hemangiopericytoma , glomus tumor , myofibroma , and myopericytoma and are uncommon lesions<symptom> intracranially. Consideration of and distinction among these perivascular tumors is critically important , as they each have distinct clinical behaviors and management. Myopericytoma can mimic other neoplastic and cerebrovascular pathologies , but it most commonly has a benign course and can be surgically cured if a gross total resection can be achieved. Rarer myopericytoma variants that adopt a more malignant course have been described , and ongoing molecular studies may identify mutations or activated signaling pathways that can be targeted to offer chemotherapeutic options in the future.
