  The roles of dispersal and recruitment have long been a focal point in ecology and conservation. The adopted migrant hypothesis proposes a life history in which social learning transmits migratory knowledge between generations of iteroparous fish. Specifically , juveniles disperse from the parental spawning site , encounter and recruit to a local adult population , and learn migration routes between spawning and foraging habitats by following older , experienced fish. Although the adopted migrant life history may apply to many species of pelagic marine fishes , there is scant theoretical or empirical work on the consequent population dynamics. We developed and analyzed a mathematical model of this life history in which the recruitment of juveniles depends on the relative abundance of the local populations and recruitment overlap , which measures the ease with which juveniles are recruited by a nonparental population. We demonstrate that the adopted migrant life history can maintain spatial demographic structure among local populations , that it can also predispose local populations to collapse when a tipping point is crossed , and that recovery after collapse is impaired by reduced recruitment at small local population sizes.
