  The last couple of decades have witnessed tremendous development within N-heterocyclic carbene ( abbreviated as NHC) organocatalysis. NHCs have been used as powerful organic catalysts in asymmetric synthesis. Although great achievements have been made in the asymmetric NHC catalysis , their applications in the kinetic resolution ( abbreviated as KR) , dynamic kinetic resolution ( abbreviated as DKR) and desymmetrization processes have been relatively less developed. Moreover , limited activation modes have been involved in these processes. This review provides an overview of the NHC organocatalyzed KR , DKR and desymmetrization reactions in the preparation of chiral functional molecules. The aim is to highlight both of the importance and elegance of these methods in the construction of challenging chiral compounds and to provide our own perspective into the future development in this direction.
