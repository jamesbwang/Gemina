  The assembly of Ig genes in developing B lymphocytes by V ( D) J recombination is initiated by the RAG1-RAG2 endonuclease complex. We previously identified an interaction between RAG1 and viral protein R binding protein ( VprBP) ( also known as DNA damage binding protein 1 cullin 4-associated factor 1 ( DCAF1)) , a substrate receptor for the cullin 4-really interesting new gene ( RING) E3 ubiquitin ligase ( CRL4). We report in this article that in mice , B cell-intrinsic loss of VprBP increases RAG1 protein levels and disrupts expression of the endoribonuclease Dicer , which is essential for microRNA maturation.
