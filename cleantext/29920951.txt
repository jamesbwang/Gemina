  Recently , supramolecular hydrogels have attracted increasing interest owing to their tunable stability and inherent biocompatibility. However , only few studies have been reported in the literature on self-healing supramolecular nucleoside hydrogels , compared to self-healing polymer hydrogels. In this work , we successfully developed a self-healing supramolecular nucleoside hydrogel obtained by simply mixing equimolar amounts of guanosine ( G) and isoguanosine ( isoG) in the presence of K
