  Humans carry trillions of viruses that thrive because of their ability to exploit the host. In this exploitation , viruses promote their own replication by suppressing the host antiviral response and by inducing changes in host biosynthetic processes , often with extremely small genomes of their own. In the review , we discuss the phenomenon of histone mimicry by viral proteins and how this mimicry allows the virus to dial in to the cell 's transcriptional processes and establish a cell state that promotes infection. We suggest that histone mimicry is part of a broader viral strategy to use intrinsic protein disorder as a means to overcome the size limitations of its own genome and to maximize its impact on host protein networks. In particular , we discuss how intrinsic protein disorder may enable viral proteins to interfere with phase-separated host protein condensates , including those that contribute to chromatin-mediated control of gene expression.
