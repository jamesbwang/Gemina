  Primary hyperaldosteronism ( PHA) is the most common form of secondary hypertension of hormonal origin. It affects about 10 % of all hypertensive patients. It is connected with increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases ( CVD) compared to patients with essential hypertension of a similar age. Usually , it is an effect of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia<disease> ( BAH) or aldosterone-producing adenoma ( APA) , more rare causes of PHA are: unilateral adrenal hyperplasia<disease> , aldosterone-producing adrenocortical carcinoma , ectopic aldosterone-producing tumors and familial hyperaldosteronism. Recent genetic studies have thrown a new light on the pathogenesis of PHA , classifying it as a channelopathy. Several mutations within the ion channels encoding genes have been identified. A possible link between primary hyperaldosteronism and polymorphism of aldosterone synthase gene and ion channel genes is still being investigated. In this manuscript , we focus on genetic aspects of primary hyperaldosteronism , and present an up-to-date compilation of available data with the widened pathogenetic approach.
