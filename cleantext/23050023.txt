  The underlying molecular basis of ischemic heart diseases ( IHDs) has not yet been studied among Iraqi people. This study determined the frequency and types of some cardiovascular genetic risk factors among Iraqi patients with IHDs. This is a cross-sectional study recruiting 56 patients with acute IHD during a 2-month period excluding patients > 50 years and patients with documented hyperlipidemia. Their ages ranged between 18 and 50 years; males were 54 and females were only 2. Peripheral blood samples were aspirated from all patients for troponin I and DNA testing. Molecular analysis to detect 12 common cardiovascular genetic risk factors using CVD StripAssay The genotype frequencies of 12 genetic mutations/polymorphisms were as follows: MTHFR A1298C and C677T were the highest reported mutations ( 62.5 % and 50 % , respectively) , followed by Î²-fibrinogen gene mutation , homozygous angiotensin-converting enzyme D/D , heterozygous human platelet antigen-1 ( a/b) polymorphisms , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 4G/4G , homozygous E4 allele of apolipoprotein E gene , Leu allele of Factor XIII V34L variant , heterozygous FV R2 , Factor V Leiden mutation , prothrombin G20210A mutation , respectively. Genetic risk scores were calculated and a number ranging from 0 to 8 were given to each patient. None ( 0 %) had a risk score > 6 or < 2; 22 ( 39.3 %) patients had a risk score of 4 and > 60 % of cases had a risk score of 4 or more. The obtained results constitute a reference guide where future studies on normal people and older IHD patients can rely on to determine whether these can be used for pre-clinical risk assessment.
