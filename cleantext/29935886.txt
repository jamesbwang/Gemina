  N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor ( NMDAR) has been largely implicated in the neurobiology of schizophrenia and other psychosis. Aiming to evaluate their potential as peripheral biomarkers for psychosis , we quantified the plasma concentrations of NR1 and NR2 NMDAR subunits of first-episode psychosis patients in their first contact with mental health services due to psychotic symptoms , compared with siblings and matched community-based controls. The quantifications of NR1 and NR2 plasma concentrations were performed by ELISA. Data were analysed by nonparametric tests and Receiver Operating Curve ( ROC) analysis. We included 166 first-episode psychosis patients ( mean age = 30.3 ± 12.2 years; 64 % men) , with the diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum ( n = 84) , bipolar disorder ( n = 51) and psychotic depression<symptom> ( n = 31) , 76 siblings ( mean age = 31.5 ± 11.0 years; 30.3 % men) and 166 healthy community-based controls ( mean age = 31.4 ± 12.0 years; 63.9 % men). NMDAR subunits were significantly lower in patients compared with siblings and controls ( p < 0.001) , except by NR1 plasma concentrations of bipolar patients compared with siblings and controls. NR1 plasma concentrations lower than 17.65 pg/ml ( AUC = 0.621) showed sensitivity of 42.8 % , specificity of 84.3 % , positive predictive value ( PPV) of 73.2 % and negative predictive value ( NPV) of 59.6 %. Individuals with NR2 plasma concentrations lower than 2.92 ng/ml ( AUC = 0.801) presented a 10.61-fold increased risk of psychosis , with a sensibility of 71.9 % , specificity of 80.6 % , PPV of 79.0 % and NPV of 73.9 %. This is the first study reporting the measurement and the reduction of NR1 and NR2 NMDAR subunits plasma concentrations in psychiatric disorders. In particular , the NR2 subunit may be a possible plasma biomarker for psychosis.
