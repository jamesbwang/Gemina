  To describe a novel technique of scleral indentation and transillumination for single-surgeon , unassisted vitrectomy and vitreous base shaving enhanced with a digital heads-up display system ( NGENUITY 3D Visualization System; Alcon , Fort Worth , TX). This technique was utilized in six eyes of six patients during vitrectomy surgery for common vitreoretinal surgical diagnoses. In each case , the transillumination was performed with the traditional intraocular light pipe set at 100 % power , placed obliquely just posterior to the vitreous base insertion , with or without a transillumination adapter. The visualization of the vitreous cavity was digitally enhanced using a heads-up display system ( NGENUITY 3D) with light amplification settings increased to near-maximal gain. In each case , the adequacy of the surgical view was judged intraoperatively by two independent surgeons who shared the same surgical view as the primary surgeon. In this series , the surgical view provided by the scleral transillumination was deemed adequate to safely perform surgery in five of six cases. In the one patient in whom this was not the case , vitrectomy was completed using traditional endo-illumination and scleral depression<symptom> performed by a skilled assistant. Lighter fundus pigmentation , myopia , thin sclera<symptom> , and absence of dense peripheral media opacities were associated with improved view with scleral transillumination. There were no intraoperative complications. Digitally enhanced scleral transillumination affords surgeons another option for safe and effective simultaneous scleral depression<symptom> and illumination for unassisted peripheral vitrectomy.
