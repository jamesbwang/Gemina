  Considering that osteoarthritis ( OA) is the most prevalent joint disease worldwide , multiple pharmacological treatments have been proposed to alter the articular structure with potential benefit in the progression of the disease. The so-called disease-modifying OA drugs have been frequently investigated but conclusive findings are rare. Strontium ranelate ( SrRan) is a drug usually prescribed to treat osteoporosis , with proven effects in decreasing the risk of fractures and possible effect in reducing the progression of OA. The objective of this review was to demonstrate the current panorama of knowledge on the use of SrRan in clinical and experimental models , clarifying its mechanisms of action and describing possible anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects. The systematic review was based on the PRISMA statement and included articles that are indexed in scientific databases. Fifteen studies were included: seven pre-clinical and eight clinical studies. Despite the limited number of studies , the results suggest a positive effect of SrRan in patients with OA , through changes in functional capacity and reduction of progression of morphological parameters and joint degradation , with moderate quality of evidence for those clinical outcomes. Novel studies are necessary to elucidate the molecular targets of SrRan , focusing on anti-inflammatory effects and histological changes promoted by SrRan , which seemed to reduce the progression of OA in the experimental and clinical studies.
