  With nearly 40 % of U.S. adults obese , and childhood and adolescent rates rising , obesity and associated comorbidities are serious public health concerns with massive societal costs. Often , lifestyle interventions do not offer sufficient weight<symptom> loss<symptom> to improve health , requiring surgery and medications as adjunct management strategies. Here , we present a 4-month case study in which the sustained , low-dose , and constant administration of the thyroid receptor Î² selective agonist GC-1 ( sobetirome) from a novel nanochannel membrane implant was assessed in an obese , pre-diabetic rhesus macaque. Dramatic loss of white adipose tissue in the abdomen from 36 to 18 % was observed via magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with normalized serum insulin and glycemia , with no signs of cardiotoxicity shown. The non-human primate study highlights sustained low-dose delivery of GC-1 from our minimally invasive subcutaneous implant as a valuable approach to induce weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and manage obesity and comorbidities , including type 2 diabetes.
