  ( Purpose) Most studies on bodyblade exercise have examined changes in muscle activities in the trunk and shoulders according to the hand position or direction while in a standing position. The present study compared and examined the changes in muscle activities around the shoulders and trunk according to different bodyblade lifting methods during stabilization exercise in a quadruped position. ( Subjects and Methods) The present study was conducted on 20 healthy males. The following exercise four types were performed with the bodyblade held by flexing the dominant arm at 180 ° in a quadruped position. The muscle activity and the ratio of muscle activity were measured. ( Results) The SA and IO , EO muscles showed significant differences. Moreover , the SA/UT activity ratio showed significant differences according to the type of exercise. The Tukey 's post hoc test results were as follows: for the SA muscle , exercise types 4 , 2 were more effective than types 1 , 3: and for the IO muscle , types 1 , 2 were more effective than types 3 , 4. ( Conclusion) The present study showed that type 2 scapular stabilization exercise ( crossed leg lifting with the hand raised above the head on a vertical plane) showed selective and positive effects on trunk muscle strengthening and stabilization. In future , additional studies are required to design effective exercise programs for pain management and improvement of muscle activities in patients with complaints of shoulder pain due to scapular winging.
