  Children with autism not only have limited social and communicative skills but also have motor abnormalities , such as poor timing and coordination of balance<symptom>. Moreover , impaired gross motor skills hamper participation with peers. Balance<symptom> control is interesting from a cognitive science perspective , since it involves a complex interplay between information processing , motor planning , and timing and sequencing of muscle<symptom> movements<symptom>. In this paper , we discuss the background of motor problems in children with autism , focusing on how posture<symptom> is informed by sensory information processing. We also discuss the neurobiological basis of balance<symptom> problems , and how this is related to anxiety<symptom> in this group. We then discuss possible avenues for treatment of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) symptoms , especially as regards movement-related interventions. Finally , we present a theoretical outlook and discuss whether some of the symptoms in ASD can be understood from an embodied cognition perspective.
