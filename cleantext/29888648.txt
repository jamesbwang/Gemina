  To examine BDNF , dopamine , and motor function changes after bilateral anodal transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS) in patients with Parkinson 's disease. 20 patients undertook ten sessions of bilateral anodal tDCS stimulation applied simultaneously over FC1/FC2 , targeting left and right prefrontal and motor areas. Dopamine and BDNF serum levels , and Movement Disorders Society- Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale part three ( MDS-UPDRS-III) total score and disability sub-scores were examined pre/post-tDCS stimulation. BDNF serum level increased significantly and came with significant improvement in motor functions ( decrease in MDS-UPDRS-III total score/sub-scores) , whereas dopamine level showed no changes. However , there was no significant statistical correlation between the motor functions ' improvement and BDNF level increase. Bilateral anodal tDCS is a safe stimulation protocol that leads to motor functions ' improvement and BDNF serum level increase in patients with Parkinson 's disease , however the findings of this feasible study are preliminary and further study is needed.
