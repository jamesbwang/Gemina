  Regulatory T cells ( Tregs) are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis , but their presence in tumor tissues impairs anti-tumor immunity and portends poor prognoses in cancer patients. Here , we reveal a mechanism to selectively target and reprogram the function of tumor-infiltrating Tregs ( TI-Tregs) by exploiting their dependency on the histone H3K27 methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 ( EZH2) in tumors. Disruption of EZH2 activity in Tregs , either pharmacologically or genetically , drove the acquisition of pro-inflammatory functions in TI-Tregs , remodeling the tumor microenvironment and enhancing the recruitment and function of CD8
