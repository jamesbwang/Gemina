  An e-learning tutorial was developed to cover the basic aspects of acute burns management. The aim of this study was to provide objective educational evidence supporting the role of an e-learning on acute burns management ( `` basic burns management '' or BBM) when compared with traditional teaching methods when introduced in different medical school settings around the world. A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh , Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry , and St. George 's University of London comparing the learning experience of medical students with the BBM e-learning tool ( intervention) and a traditional lecture ( control). A group of medical students was randomly allocated to the e-learning or lecture arms. Both groups were subjected to a 10-question pre-intervention and post-intervention tests assessing burns knowledge , and were asked to fill out a satisfaction survey. A total of 79 medical students of varying years of study participated. As a whole , students demonstrated a significant gain in knowledge after intervention ( overall = 47.6 % , P < .001) , regardless of medical school year of study or interest in surgery. Participants undertaking the BBM e-learning had a greater exam score improvement and satisfaction compared with the traditional lecture even though they were not statistically significant. BBM e-learning is a free tool that provides comparable acute burn care learning opportunity and satisfaction outcomes to a traditional lecture , allowing convenient and standardized incorporation of burns teaching within an educational setting , regardless of geographical location , level of experience , or interest in surgery.
