  Sarcopenia is significantly associated with the degree of liver fibrosis<disease>. This study investigated the influence of sarcopenia on liver fibrosis<disease> in individuals with chronic hepatitis<disease> B. Data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2008-2011 were analysed. The sarcopenia index ( total appendicular skeletal muscle mass ( kg)/ body mass index ( kg/m Among the 506 respondents with chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( 258 men and 248 women) , the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis<disease> score and fibrosis-4 index identified sarcopenia and significant fibrosis<disease> in 126 ( 24.9 %) and 217 ( 42.9 %) , respectively. Sarcopenia was significantly associated with significant fibrosis<disease> , regardless of the fibrosis<disease> prediction model used ( all P < 0.05). When the study population was stratified according to metabolic factors , sarcopenia was specifically associated with an increased risk of significant fibrosis<disease> among subgroups with obesity , insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome<disease> and liver steatosis ( odds ratio 2.37-3.57; all P < 0.05). An independent association between sarcopenia and significant fibrosis<disease> was identified after adjusting for other confounders ( odds ratio 2.67-3.62 by the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis<disease> score and 2.04-2.62 by the fibrosis-4 index; all P < 0.05). Sarcopenia is associated with significant fibrosis<disease> in subjects with chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> , specifically those with obesity , insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome<disease> and liver steatosis.
