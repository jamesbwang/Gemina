  Due to ubiquitous computing , knowledge workers do not only work in typical work-associated environments ( e.g. , the office) but also wherever it best suits their schedule or preferences ( e.g. , the park). In two experiments using laboratory and field methods , we compared decision making in work and non-work environments. We hypothesised that participants make riskier work-related decisions when in work-associated environments and riskier non-work-related decisions in non-work-associated environments. Therefore , if environment ( work vs. non-work) and decision-making task ( work-related vs. non-work-related) are incongruent , then risk-taking should be lower , as the decision maker might feel the situation is unusual or inappropriate. Although results do not reveal that work-associated environments generally encourage riskier work-related decisions ( and likewise for non-work) , we found environmental effects on decision making when including mood as a moderator.
