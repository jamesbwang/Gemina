  In single-site olefin polymerization catalysis , a large excess of cocatalyst is often required for the generation of highly active catalysts , but the reason for this is unclear. In this work , fundamental insight into the multifaceted role of cocatalyst methylaluminoxane ( MAO) in the activation , deactivation , and stabilization of group 4 metallocenes in the immobilized single-site olefin polymerization catalyst was gained. Employing probe molecule FT-IR spectroscopy , it was found that weak Lewis acid sites , inherent to the silica-supported MAO cocatalyst , are the main responsible species for the genesis of active metallocenes for olefin polymerization. These weak Lewis acid sites are the origin of AlMe
