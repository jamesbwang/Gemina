  Italian Directives recommend the good quality of natural mineral waters but literature data assert a potential risk from microorganisms colonizing wellsprings and mineral water bottling plants. We evaluated the presence of microorganisms in spring waters ( SW) and bottled mineral waters ( BMW) samples. Routine microbiological indicators , additional microorganisms like Legionella<pathogen> spp. , Nontuberculous mycobacteria ( NTM) and amoebae ( FLA) were assessed in 24 SW and 10 BMW samples performing cultural and molecular methods. In 33 out of 34 samples , no cultivable bacteria ≥ 10 CFU/L was found. Cultivable FLA were detected in 50 % of water samples. qPCR showed the presence of Legionella<pathogen> qPCR units in 24 % of samples ( from 1.1 × 10
