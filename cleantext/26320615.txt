  Offspring size variation in relation to maternal size and season is characteristic of a range of species living in seasonal environments. Little is known about the proximate mechanisms explaining the links between maternally driven variation in offspring phenotypes , for instance when mothers have different diets depending on their size or the season. Here , we use stable isotopes techniques to quantify size dependent and seasonal variations in diet in mothers of shrimp<disease> Palaemon serratus and explore possible links between maternal diet and phenotype of embryos and freshly hatched larvae. We found that larger females , which occur more frequently in winter , produce larvae with higher carbon and nitrogen content as well as higher percent carbon , than smaller mothers collected in winter. In addition , isotopic composition suggest that larger mothers collected in winter , were feeding at a higher trophic level , or on an enriched prey pool compared with smaller mothers collected in summer. Overall , there seems to be a strong association between offspring size and maternal diet , mediated by maternal size and/or season.
