  Study Design Controlled laboratory study , longitudinal. Background Decreased extensor moments in the surgical knee during bilateral squats can persist longer than one year following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( ACLr). This is accomplished using inter-limb and intra-limb compensations. Objectives Assess loading during squatting longitudinally , 3 and 5 months post-ACLr , and to determine the extent to which inter- and intra-limb compensations contribute to reduced knee extensor moments. Methods 11 individuals ( 4 males) underwent 3-dimensional motion analysis of a squat at 3 and 5 months post-ACLr. MANOVA ( limb Ã— time) assessed differences in peak knee and hip flexion angles , knee extensor moment , vertical ground reaction force and hip to knee extensor moment ratio. Stepwise linear regression determined the contribution of inter-limb ( between-limb vertical ground reaction force ratio) and intra-limb ( within surgical limb hip to knee moment ratio) compensations to the between-limb knee extensor moment ratio. Results Significant effect ( limb) was observed for knee flexion angle , knee extensor moment , vertical ground reaction force , and hip to knee extensor moment ratio , while a significant effect ( time) was observed for knee extensor moment and hip to knee extensor moment ratio. 3 months , vertical ground reaction force ratio and hip to knee extensor moment ratio predicted knee extensor moment ratio ( R
