  Increasing Complexity in Performance Delivery- Management Approach for Tertiary Care Centers Abstract. General social trends such as individualization and female shift increase the complexity for management in both technical and system management in addition to the inherent development in the hospital industry such as subspecialization , ageing societies and multimorbidity. Reduction of complexity is therefore absolutely necessary in order to be able to manage in a patient-friendly way as a maximum care provider. Reducing complexity means resolving therapeutic conflicts. Essential tools for this are digitization , a comprehensive quality paradigm that includes patient experience , patient assessment of treatment outcomes , indication and service quality , and good management. The latter integrates the fragmentation of skills and knowledge of a subspecialized medicine through appropriate system design. This requires the appropriate functional strategies and a comprehensive process management competence that can transform the numerous interfaces into seams.
