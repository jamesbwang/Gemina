  Cellular lipid homeostasis is maintained through an intricately linked array of anabolic and catabolic pathways. Upon flavivirus<pathogen> infections , these are significantly altered: on the one hand , these viruses can co-opt lipid metabolic pathways to generate ATP to facilitate replication , or to synthesize membrane components to generate replication sites; on the other hand , more recent evidence suggests counter strategies employed by host cells , which actively modulate several of these networks in response to infection , enhancing interferon signaling by doing so , and thus creating an antiviral environment. In this review , we discuss recent data on mechanisms of alteration of lipid metabolic pathways during infection by flaviviruses , with a focus on cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis , which can be manipulated by the invading viruses to support replication , but can also be modulated by the host immune system itself , as a means to fight infection.
