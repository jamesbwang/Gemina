  Plant-parasitic nematodes cause considerable damage to crop plants. The rhizosphere microbiome can affect invasion and reproductive success of plant-parasitic nematodes , thus affecting plant damage. In this study , we investigated how the transplanted rhizosphere microbiome from different crops affect plant-parasitic nematodes on soybean or tomato , and whether the plant 's own microbiome from the rhizosphere protects it better than the microbiome from fallow soil. Soybean plants growing in sterilized substrate were inoculated with the microbiome extracted from the rhizosphere of soybean , maize , or tomato. Controls were inoculated with extracts from bulk soil , or not inoculated. After the microbiome was established , the root lesion<symptom> nematode
