  Study Design An explorative 7-day prospective cohort study. Background Overweight and obese novice runners are subjected to a higher load per stride than their normal-weight peers. Yet , do they reduce their running dose accordingly when commencing a self-chosen running regime? Objectives To describe and compare the preferred running dose in normal-weight ( NWR) , overweight ( OWR) and obese novice runners ( OBR) when they commence a self-chosen running regime. Methods 914 novice runners were categorized into one of 3 exposure groups based on their body mass index ( BMI): ( i) NWR ( BMI < 25 , n = 405 , reference group); ( ii) OWR ( BMI 25 to < 30 , n = 341); and ( iii) OBR ( BMI â‰¥ 30 , n = 168). All runners were equipped with a GPS running watch which provided information about distance , duration , speed , and date of each running session during the first week of a self-chosen running regime. Results During the first session , OWR ( difference: -0.5 km/h; 95 % CI: -0.8 , -0.2; p < 0.05) and OBR ( -1.7 km/h; 95 % CI: -2.0 , -1.4; p < 0.05) ran slower than NWR. OBR also ran less distance than NWR ( -0.4 km , 95 % CI: -0.7; -0.2 , p < 0.05). During the first week , OWR ( -0.5 km/h; 95 % CI: -0.7 , -0.2 , p < 0.05) and OBR ( -1.7 km/h; 95 % CI: -2.0 , -1.4; p < 0.05) ran slower than NWR , while running distance and duration were similar. Conclusion OWE and OBR chose a similar training dose as NWR when commencing a self-chosen running regime. This may partly explain the higher running-injury risk among OWR and OBR compared with NWR observed by other studies. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther , Epub 22 Jun 2018. doi: 10.2519/ jospt .2018.8169.
