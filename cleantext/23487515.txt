  Observed phenotypic variation in living organisms is shaped by genomes , environment , and their interactions. Flowering time under natural conditions can showcase the diverse outcome of the gene-environment interplay. However , identifying hidden patterns and specific factors underlying phenotypic plasticity under natural field conditions remains challenging. With a genetic population showing dynamic changes in flowering time , here we show that the integrated analyses of genomic responses to diverse environments is powerful to reveal the underlying genetic architecture. Specifically , the effect continuum of individual genes (
