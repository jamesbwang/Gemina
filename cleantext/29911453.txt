  A common approach to enforcing a university smoke-free policy is through `` community-based '' enforcement , in which the entire campus community is responsible for asking smokers in violation to abide by the policy. The purpose of the study was to explore university students ' experiences with this strategy of enforcing a smoke-free policy. A total of 43 undergraduate students were interviewed regarding their experiences and opinions of community enforcement. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using phenomenological methods , in which six major themes emerged from the data: Fear ( alarm that smokers might respond with verbal insults or physical violence) , Situational ( enforcing the policy depended on violators ' distance , group settings , strangers vs. peers) , Protect Image ( not wanting to be viewed as annoying , judgmental , or offensive) , Lack of Authority ( feeling a lack of authority to enforce the smoking policy) , Compassion ( empathy that violators smoke due to physical/emotional needs) , and Enforcer ( willingness to confront a policy violator). These findings reflected previous studies regarding people 's fear to ask a smoker to extinguish a cigarette , feelings of a lack of authority , and so on. The study demonstrated that using only a community-based approach to enforcement may not be a realistic responsibility to impose on an entire campus community.
