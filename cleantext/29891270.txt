  We report a technique in the management of the type III Apert hand. The proposed approach facilitates the creation of a 5-fingered hand in 3 stages. We reviewed records of patients with Apert syndrome<disease> and type III hands surgically treated at our institution from 1995 through 2014. In all cases , syndactyly release was performed in 3 stages with prioritization of the border digits. In addition , limited retrograde , axial osteotomies between the phalangeal segments of the conjoined index , middle , and ring fingers were performed during the first stage. Medical records were reviewed for demographics , clinical presentation , operative findings , and postoperative outcomes. Twelve pediatric patients with type III hands underwent syndactyly release. Median patient age was 10.0 , 15.8 , and 29.6 months at operative stages 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively. A thumb and 4 fingers were achieved for all but 1 hand. The median duration of hospital stay was 2 days for each stage. No infections or major complications were observed. We demonstrate this method as a safe and effective means of creating 5 digits in the Apert patient with type III hands. Our opinion is that the additional aesthetic and functional gains offset the requirement of a 3-stage approach. Therapeutic IV.
