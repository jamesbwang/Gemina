  The complement system , composed of the three activation pathways , has both protective and pathogenic roles in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus ( or lupus) , a prototypic autoimmune disease. The classical pathway contributes to the clearance of immune complexes ( ICs) and apoptotic cells , whereas the alternative pathway ( AP) exacerbates renal<symptom> inflammation<symptom>. The role of the lectin pathway ( LP) in lupus has remained largely unknown. Mannose-binding lectin ( MBL)- associated serine proteases ( MASPs) , which are associated with humoral pattern recognition molecules ( MBL or ficolins) , are the enzymatic constituents of the LP and AP.
