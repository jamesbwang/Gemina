  Oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( ox-LDL) is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and often causes injury to vascular endothelial cells. We found that pinocembrin , a natural antioxidant found in honey and certain herbs , protects human aortic endothelial cells ( HAECs) from ox-LDL-induced injury. Pinocembrin suppresses the expression of pro-inflammatory vascular adhesion molecules ( VCAM-1 , ICAM-1 and E-selectin) and cytokines ( TNF-α , IL-1β , and IL-8) , as well as ROS production induced by ox-LDL. Pinocembrin potently inhibits the attachment of monocytes to HAEC cells. Mechanistically , pinocembrin suppresses activation of the MAPK kinase p38 and NF-κB pathways in the context of ox-LDL. Our data indicate that pinocembrin is a promising versatile natural compound that can protect endothelial cells from injury.
