  Laser capture microdissection ( LCM) has allowed gene expression analysis of single cells and enriched cell populations in tissue sections. LCM is a great tool for the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying cell differentiation and the development and progression of various diseases , including glaucoma. Glaucoma , which comprises a family of progressive optic neuropathies , is the most common cause of irreversible blindness<symptom> worldwide. Structural changes and damage within the trabecular meshwork ( TM) can result in increased intraocular pressure ( IOP) , which is a major risk factor for developing glaucoma. However , the precise molecular mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. The ability to perform gene expression analysis will be crucial in obtaining further insights into the function of these cells and its role in the regulation of IOP and glaucoma development. To achieve this , a reproducible method for isolating highly enriched TM from frozen sections of mouse eyes and a method for downstream gene expression analysis , such as RT-qPCR and RNA-Seq is needed. The method described herein is developed to isolate highly pure TM from mouse eyes for downstream digital PCR and microarray analysis. In addition , this technique can be easily adapted for the isolation of other highly enriched ocular cells and cell compartments that have been difficult to isolate from mouse eyes. The combination of LCM and RNA analysis can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular events underlying glaucoma.
