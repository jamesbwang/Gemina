  Rational design provides an attractive strategy to tune and control the reactivity of bioinspired catalysts. Although there has been considerable progress in the design of heme oxidase mimetics with active-site environments of ever-growing complexity and catalytic efficiency , their stability during turnover is still an open challenge. Herein , we show that the simple incorporation of two 2-aminoisobutyric acids into an artificial peptide-based peroxidase results in a new catalyst ( Fe
