  The aim of this study was to analyse and test a theoretical generic health promotion capacity-building framework with empirical data on primary health care. The framework consists of seven dimensions: commitment , management , monitoring and needs assessment , resources , common practices , participation and other core functions. The data were collected in 2014 from all the health centres in Finland , of which 156 ( 99 %) submitted their data. The data were scored by the quality of activities on a scale from 0 to 100 , where 100 stands for desirable quality. Individual indicators were nested into subdimensions , which in turn were nested into the dimensions of the theoretical framework. Variables were clustered using the dimensions and subdimensions as initial partitions. The internal consistency of dimensions and subdimensions was tested with standardized Cronbach 's alpha both before and after the clustering analysis. The results showed that although the internal consistency of the dimensions was high in the initial classification , it is possible to get even more consistent dimensions. The internal consistency of the initial classification varied from 0.62 in participation to 0.93 in common practices. In the clustering analysis , 45 out of 203 indicators were assigned to a dimension different from the initial partition. The biggest gain in internal consistency was achieved in the subdimension of systematic mass communications by relocating two indicators. This study suggests that it is possible to assess the health promotion capacity-building of organizations in a coherent way with comparable and objective indicators. These analyses also show that the number of indicators can be reduced. It would be interesting to see how the framework works in other governmental structures or political contexts.
