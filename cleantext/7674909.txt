  Multiple factors contribute to the rising rates of obesity and to difficulties in weight reduction that exist in the worldwide population. Caloric intake via sugar-sweetened beverages may be influential. This study tested the hypothesis that liquid sucrose intake promotes obesity by increasing serum insulin levels and tissue lipid accumulation. C57BL/6J mice were given 30 % sucrose in liquid form. Changes in weight gain , body composition , energy expenditure ( EE) , and tissue lipid content were measured. Mice drinking sucrose gained more total body mass ( TBM) , had greater fat mass , and displayed impaired glucose tolerance relative to control mice. These metabolic changes occurred without alterations in circulating insulin levels and despite increases in whole body EE. Lipid accrued in liver , but not skeletal muscle , of sucrose-consuming mice. Oxygen consumption ( VO Weight gain induced by intake of liquid sucrose in mice is associated with lipid accrual in liver , but not skeletal muscle , and occurs without an increase in circulating insulin.
