  Specific immunoglobulin E ( IgE) sensitization to wheat is more common than a doctor 's confirmed wheat allergy and is also frequently observed in grass pollen-allergic patients ( pollinosis patients). Thus , the objective of this study was to investigate the level and feature of serological IgE cross-reactivity between grass pollen and wheat in a cohort of pollinosis subjects with no diagnosis of wheat allergy. Seventy-two children , aged 5-17 years , with a doctor 's diagnosis of pollinosis , IgE towards grass pollen , and currently eating wheat were recruited. Serum samples were analyzed for IgE against wheat , timothy grass/wheat-specific allergen components , Pru p 3 , and cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants ( CCD) and specific IgE-binding inhibition experiments were performed. Sixty percent of the grass pollen subjects were sensitized to wheat with a median of 0.5 kUA/L. Wheat-sensitized subjects were more often sensitized to the two allergens , Phl p 12 and CCD , known to be cross-reactive between grass and wheat. Sensitizations to seven wheat-specific allergens derived from the gluten fraction were , with the exception of one individual , only found in wheat-sensitized subjects. These subjects also more often reported current and past history of allergy to staple foods ( milk , egg , wheat , soy , and fish). Wheat sensitization caused by cross-reactivity but also by sensitization to wheat-specific allergens was common in the grass-allergic children and also associated with allergy to staple foods other than wheat. The results indicate the presence of a subgroup of pollinosis patients with simultaneous sensitization to wheat and food allergy not only caused by cross-reactions.
