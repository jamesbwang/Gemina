  Health-care companies around the world face an unprecedented challenge of rising health-care costs , increasing life expectancy and escalating demand. Although national health-care budgets have increased ( as a percentage of gross domestic product) health care continues to impart significant upward pressure on national expenditure , particularly in the UK ( Licchetta and Stelmach , 2016). Additionally a substantial funding gap will continue to grow ( Gainsbury , 2016). In response to this challenge a ` value ' based strategy has gained momentum over the last two decades. Several pioneers of this approach ( Sir Muir Gray at Oxford University , Professor Michael Porter at Harvard University and Professor Elizabeth Teisberg at Dell Medical School) emphasize the importance of organizations focusing on ` value '. Porter and Teisberg ( 2006) highlight the ` value equation ' as obtaining the very best patient outcomes for each unit of currency spent. Gray expands on this model , describing three types of value: allocative , technical and personal ( Gray , 2011). Although some global health-care organizations have embraced the value-based agenda to transform acute care facilities , mental health providers have been slow to consider the benefits of this approach. This article gives a broad overview of implementing a value-based model in mental health care , the significant development resources needed , organizational issues , and finally concludes with the benefits and a vision of value-based mental health care for the future.
