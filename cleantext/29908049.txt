  Procedural sedation with propofol is widely used in the pediatric population. A well-known side effect of propofol is a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance resulting in hypotension<symptom> , but little is known about the effects on microcirculation in humans. We aimed to evaluate the effects of propofol on the sublingual microcirculatory perfusion by continuous video imaging in pediatric patients undergoing procedural sedation. Patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for procedural sedation were recruited. Oral microcirculation was measured employing a continuous monitoring strategy with incident dark-field illumination imaging. Measurements were obtained before and 3 minutes after propofol induction. Total and perfused vessel densities , proportion of perfused vessels , microvascular flow index , blood vessel diameter ( Ø Continuous measurements were achieved in seven patients. Three minutes after propofol induction mean arterial pressure decreased ( P = 0.028) and total and perfused vessel densities increased by 12 % ( P = 0.018) and 16 % ( P = 0.018) , respectively. MFI was unaltered and mean Ø Propofol induction induces a reduction in mean arterial pressure and a rise in sublingual microvascular perfusion. The observed effects of propofol on the sublingual microcirculation may be due to a decrease in microvascular resistance.
