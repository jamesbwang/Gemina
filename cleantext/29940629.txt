  The aim of the present study was to assess the capability of the low-cost VELscope device to visualize the tissue auto-fluorescence of potentially malignant oral lesions<symptom> and to establish the diagnostic accuracy , sensitivity , and specificity of this method when validating the retrieved data through the gold standard , i.e. , histological examination. Eighteen patients were evaluated by conventional oral examination ( COE) followed by direct visual fluorescence evaluation ( DVFE) using VELscope. Areas clinically suspicious detected by COE or with positive DVFE ( visual fluorescence loss) were further investigated using surgical biopsy. Eight positive biopsies for malignant lesions<symptom> were detected by COE and DVFE. Only one positive biopsy for a premalignant lesion<symptom> was not in accordance with COE and DVFE. One lesion<symptom> identified on the VELscope and COE as a non-malignant lesion<symptom> was confirmed by the biopsy. Therefore , the VELscope system had a sensitivity of 94.44 % and a specificity of 100 % in discriminating in situ normal mucosa from carcinoma or from invasive carcinoma , compared with histology. The predictive positive value was 100 % and the negative predictive value was 50 % , with a 95 % confidence interval ( CI). DVFE allows for a simple and cost-effective margin determination , in order to perform the detection and screening of oral precancerous and early cancerous disorders. It was found that the VELscope system could not fully replace the histopathology procedure. Nonetheless , the study demonstrated its usefulness for clinical examination , monitoring oral lesions<symptom> , and guiding the biopsy. Therefore , this method may add sensitivity to the oral tissue examination and be an effective adjunct for high-risk patients.
