  A family of six homoleptic ( CuI ( Ln)) 2 ( ClO4) 2 and six heteroleptic ( CuI ( Ln) ( PPh3) 2) 2 ( ClO4) 2 bimetallic complexes , where Ln are bis-Schiff base ligands with alkyl spacers of variable length ( n = 2-7- CH2-) , were prepared to evaluate the role of the spacer on the formation of helicates or mesocates. In the homoleptic series , spectroscopic and theoretical studies indicate that preferences for a conformation are based on energetic parameters , mainly , the establishment of non-covalent interactions. The odd-even nature of the spacers pre-conditions the superposition of the aromatic rings to allow the juxtaposition necessary for non-covalent interactions , while the increase of the length reduces the strength of such interactions. Consequently , complexes with even-spacers of short length were identified as helicates in solution , ( CuI ( Ln)) 22 + ( n = 2,4). Complexes ( CuI ( Ln)) 22 + ( n = 3-7) dissociate in solution to produce the monometallic complexes in equilibrium , ( CuI ( Ln)) +. The stability of the bimetallic species is discussed in terms of their conformations. The set of heteroleptic complexes was prepared to evaluate the reach of the `` odd-even rule '' in solid , which is based on the `` zig-zag '' arrangements of the spacers. Based on crystallographic information , `` S '' and `` C ''- type conformations of Ln are related to even and odd spacers , respectively. This trend is considered in addition to other factors to explain preferences for either a mesocate or helicate conformation in the homoleptic series.
