  The work described in this Research Communication addressed the hypothesis that it is possible to produce cheese from donkey milk by appropriate adjusting of the cheesemaking parameters. A series of coagulation trials were performed on donkey milk , alone or fortified with goat milk ( 85/15 and 70/30 , v/v) , using calf rennet under different technological conditions. The parameters that changed were pH and concentration of soluble calcium , amount of rennet added and temperature of coagulation. Donkey milk gave rise to sufficiently firm curd only at ` extreme ' technological conditions and , as expected , addition of goat milk improved coagulation. A cheesemaking protocol was developed for producing fresh cheese prototypes , which were checked for microbiological safety , chemical composition and sensory characteristics. Pure donkey milk gave 5 · 9 % yield , cheese having 6 · 12 pH , 32 · 4 % dry matter , 2 · 1 % fat and 18 · 5 % protein. The electrophoretic analysis ascertained that β-casein was the most abundant compound in donkey cheese , but whey proteins were also present in non-negligible amounts. Finally , the sensory evaluation demonstrated that all cheeses were acceptable and provided detailed description of their flavour characteristics.
