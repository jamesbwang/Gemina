  Non-invasive prenatal testing ( NIPT) evaluates circulating cell-free DNA ( cfDNA) and has been widely applied , with highly accurate results for detecting foetal trisomies 21 , 18 and 13. Recently , increasing attention has been paid to the clinical application of the non-invasive detection of foetal sub-chromosomal duplications and deletions beyond common aneuploidies. A 32-year-old healthy pregnant woman was referred to the Medical Genetic Centre of Ganzhou Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital. As routine practice , ultrasound examination at a gestational age of 16 weeks showed that the foetus is normal. To avoid invasive prenatal diagnosis procedures , an NIPT was offered to further screen for common foetal chromosomal abnormalities. The result showed that there was an approximately 50.94 Mb duplication in p11.32-q21.2 of chromosome 18 and an approximately 58.46 Mb deletion in p22.33-p11.1 of chromosome X. In addition , the chromosome karyotypes of the parents and foetus were also analysed. Chromosome karyotype analysis results showed that foetal karyotype was 46 , X , der ( 18) , the maternal karyotype was 46 , XX , t ( X; 18) ( q13; q21 .3) , and the paternal karyotype revealed no obvious abnormality. In this case , we successfully detected a healthy pregnant woman with balanced translocation X; 18 ( q13; q21 .3) and described the foetal karyotype as 46 , X , der ( 18) t ( X; 18) ( q11; q21 .1) mat. Our report illustrated these cases which present complex X; autosome balance<symptom> translocation and X; autosome unbalance translocation which may contribute to severe clinical phenotypes. In addition , our report also proved that the interruption of genes in the Xq critical region is not only reason of primary infertility<symptom>. Finally , we prompted that NIPT might play a role in the first trimester screening of sub-chromosomal rearrangement.
