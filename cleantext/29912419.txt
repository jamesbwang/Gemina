  The public health message around alcohol is complex , with benefits versus harms , the confusing concept of risk and drinking guidance changing over time. This provides a difficult context for alcohol screening in primary care , with established barriers from the practitioner perspective , but less is known about the patients ' perspective. This study explores patients ' views on drinking. Eligible participants were recorded as drinking above low risk levels in primary care. Six practices in North London participated. Interviews were in-depth , semi-structured , transcribed verbatim and underwent detailed thematic analysis. Interviews were conducted with 8 women and 12 men , aged 26-83 years , mostly educated to undergraduate level and of ` White ' ethnicity. UK drinking guidance was viewed as irrelevant for reasons related to life stage , lifestyle and absence of harm. Dependence , loss of functionality and control were perceived as key features of problematic drinking. Healthy lifestyles , in terms of diet , exercise and not smoking , were thought to mitigate potential problems associated with alcohol intake. The findings suggest that public health messages and brief advice should focus on harm experienced at different life stages , among people with different lifestyles , to challenge the ubiquitous view that ` I 'm not a real boozer '.
