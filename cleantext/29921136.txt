  This study explored the relationship between clinicians ' moral distress and family satisfaction with care in five intensive care units in Italy. A total of 122 clinicians ( 45 physicians and 77 nurses) and 59 family members completed the Italian Moral Distress Scale-Revised and the Family Satisfaction in the ICU questionnaire , respectively. Clinicians ' moral distress inversely correlated with family satisfaction related to the inclusion in the decision-making process. Specifically , physicians ' moral distress inversely correlated with satisfaction regarding the respect shown toward the patient. Nurses ' moral distress inversely correlated with satisfaction regarding breathlessness and agitation management , provision of emotional support , understanding of information , and inclusion in the decision-making process.
