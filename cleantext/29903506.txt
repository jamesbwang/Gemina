  The quality of an operation depends on operative technique. There is very little evidence , however , regarding how surgeons arrive at their intraoperative decisions. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which practicing surgeons participating in a coaching program justify their technical decisions based on their experience or based on evidence. This qualitative study evaluated 10 pairs of surgeons participating in a video review coaching program in October 2015. Using thematic analysis , the conversations were coded in an iterative process with comparative analysis to identify emerging themes. Three major themes emerged during analysis: ( 1) Individuals often reported modifications in surgical technique after a negative postoperative complication; ( 2) participants were noted to defend the use of certain techniques or surgical decisions based on the perceived expert opinion of others; and ( 3) surgeons rarely referred to evidence in surgical literature as a motivation for changing surgical technique. In this qualitative analysis of coaching conversations we found that practicing surgeons often justify their surgical decisions with anecdotal evidence and `` lessons learned , '' rather than deferring to surgical literature. This either represents a lack of evidence or poor uptake of existing data.
