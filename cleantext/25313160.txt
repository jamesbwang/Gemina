  Feature selection , which identifies a set of most informative features from the original feature space , has been widely used to simplify the predictor. Recursive feature elimination ( RFE) , as one of the most popular feature selection approaches , is effective in data dimension reduction and efficiency increase. A ranking of features , as well as candidate subsets with the corresponding accuracy , is produced through RFE. The subset with highest accuracy ( HA) or a preset number of features ( PreNum) are often used as the final subset. However , this may lead to a large number of features being selected , or if there is no prior knowledge about this preset number , it is often ambiguous and subjective regarding final subset selection. A proper decision variant is in high demand to automatically determine the optimal subset. In this study , we conduct pioneering work to explore the decision variant after obtaining a list of candidate subsets from RFE. We provide a detailed analysis and comparison of several decision variants to automatically select the optimal feature subset. Random forest<disease> ( RF)- recursive feature elimination ( RF-RFE) algorithm and a voting strategy are introduced. We validated the variants on two totally different molecular biology datasets , one for a toxicogenomic study and the other one for protein sequence analysis. The study provides an automated way to determine the optimal feature subset when using RF-RFE.
