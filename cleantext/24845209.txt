  ( 1) Background: Differential RPE ( dRPE) separates scores for breathlessness ( RPE-B) , leg<symptom> muscle exertion ( RPE-L) and technical/cognitive exertion ( RPE-T). Limited information for dRPE is available in soccer match play , yet these measurements may help inform practitioners training and recovery strategies. This preliminary study investigated the effects of playing position and contextual factors on elite soccer players ' dRPE. ( 2) Methods: Thirty-two male English Premier League players recorded dRPE scores 15 ⁻ 30 min post-match for RPE-B , RPE-L , and RPE-T. Data were analysed using linear mixed models , with magnitude-based inferences subsequently applied. ( 3) Results: Overall , the mean ± SD for the dRPE were 63 ± 23 arbitrary units ( au) ( RPE-B) , 67 ± 22 au ( RPE-L) , and 60 ± 24 au ( RPE-T). Full Backs reported substantially higher RPE-B , RPE-L and RPE-T when compared to all other positions. Substantially higher RPE-T scores were reported for matches played against Top teams compared to Bottom ( 10 au; 90 % Confidence Interval 5 to 15 au) and Middle ( 10 au; 4 to 15 au) ranked teams. The effects of match result and location on dRPE were not substantial. ( 4) Conclusions: Positional differences were observed following soccer match play for RPE-B , RPE-L and RPE-T. Full backs had substantially higher dRPE then any other position , with all players reporting increased RPE-T when playing teams at the Top of the league. These findings can help practitioners monitor internal load responses and support the prescription of training and recovery sessions.
