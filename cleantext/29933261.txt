  Our objective was to use semiautomatic methods for calculating the spike-wave index ( SWI) in electrical status epilepticus in slow-wave sleep ( ESES) and to determine whether this calculation is noninferior to human experts ( HEs). Each HE marked identical 300-second epochs for all spikes and calculated the SWI in sleep EEGs of patients diagnosed with ESES. Persyst 13 was used to mark spikes ( high sensitivity setting) in the same 300-second epochs marked by HEs. The spike-wave index was calculated. Pairwise HE differences and pairwise Persyst 13 ( P13)- HE differences for the SWI were calculated. Bootstrap resampling ( BCa , N = 3,000) was performed to better estimate mean differences and their 95 % confidence bounds between HE and P13-HE pairs. Potential noninferiority of P13 to HEs was tested by comparing the 95 % confidence bounds of the mean differences between pairs for the SWI. Twenty EEG records were analyzed. Each HE marked 100 minutes of EEG. HEs 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 marked 10,075 , 8,635 , 9,710 , and 9,898 spikes , respectively. The highest and lowest 95 % confidence bound of the mean difference in the SWI between HE pairs was: High: 10.3 %; Low: -10.2 %. Highest and lowest 95 % confidence bound of the mean difference in the SWI between P13 and HE pairings was as follows: high , 9.5 % and low , -6.7 %. The lack of a difference between P13 and HEs supports that the algorithm is not inferior to HEs. Persyst 13 is noninferior to HEs in calculating the SWI in ESES , thus suggesting that an automated approach to SWI calculation may be a useful clinical tool.
