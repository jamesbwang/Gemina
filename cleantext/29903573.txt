  Chemokines are important proteins involved in the regulation of directed leukocyte migration during inflammation<symptom> and the homeostatic homing of immune cells. In addition , they play a role in angiogenesis , hematopoiesis , organogenesis , tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore , the chemokine/chemokine receptor network is highly complex and needs to be tightly controlled. An important mechanism of fine-tuning chemokine activity and reducing its apparent redundancy is post-translational modification ( PTM) of chemokines and their receptors. Under inflammatory conditions , enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs) , plasmin , CD13 , CD26 , and peptidylarginine deiminases ( PADs) and protein-modifying agents , such as peroxynitrite , are upregulated and released and may provoke truncation , degradation , nitration or citrullination of chemokines. Most modified chemokines show altered biological activity. This review reports how PTMs influence the biological functions of chemokines , with special attention for the impact beyond chemotaxis.
