  Antisperm antibodies ( ASAs) have been associated with infertility<symptom> in stallions. The objectives of this study were to investigate the frequency of ASA-positive semen samples in satisfactory and non-satisfactory breeder stallions , the association between ASA binding and semen quality , and factors that may affect the diagnosis. Breeding soundness examinations were performed in 21 stallions and the percentage of IgG- and IgA-bound spermatozoa was evaluated using flow cytometry. Median IgG and IgA binding did not differ between the first and second ejaculates. The percentage of IgA-bound spermatozoa was higher in non-satisfactory ( n = 10) than satisfactory breeder stallions ( n = 11). However , IgG binding or frequency of IgG-positive ejaculates did not differ with stallion classification. The IgG-positive stallions had significantly lower total sperm motility , concentration and total numbers than IgG-negative stallions in the first ejaculate , and lower sperm concentration in the second ejaculate. The IgA-positive stallions had lower total sperm motility , normal spermatozoa and total numbers than IgA-negative stallions in the first ejaculate , and lower total sperm motility , normal spermatozoa and total numbers in the second ejaculate. While IgG binding did not differ with season , IgA binding was higher in the non-breeding season ( n = 6 stallions) than the breeding season ( n = 15 stallions) in the first ejaculate. Stallion age did not differ with ASA classification. In conclusion , IgG binding was highly prevalent in both groups of stallions , while IgA binding was higher and more prevalent in non-satisfactory breeders. Both isotypes were associated with poor semen quality. Season and sexual rest had an effect on IgA but not IgG binding.
