  Sargassum horneri C. Agardh is an important commercial edible seaweed species in east Asia. Benthic beds and floating rafts in coastal areas make excellent habitats for marine organisms to feed , hide , and spawn. Many commercially important fish species such as Japanese anchovy ( Engraulis japonicus<pathogen>) , yellowtail ( Seriola quinqueradiata) , and Japanese horse mackerel ( Trachurus japonicus<pathogen>) live in seaweed beds. Chinese and Japanese fisherman rely on S. horneri beds as productive fish harvest areas. The Zhejiang government in China set a total allowable catch standard , to preserve the Ma'an Islands ecosystem , which is a marine protected area. In this study we analysed the association between weight and one-sided surface area of S. horneri beds , and calculated the ratio of one-sided surface area to change in wet weight over time. We collected samples from December 2014 to May 2015. Approximately 1 g of S. horneri biomass provided ~ 15 cm2 of one-sided surface area available to marine organisms. These calculations can be used as a reference regarding potential space to improve total allowable catch standard management in S. horneri beds , through the estimation of space capacity of seaweed beds.
