  Essential proteins are crucial to living cells. Identification of essential proteins from protein-protein interaction ( PPI) networks can be applied to pathway analysis and function prediction , furthermore , it can contribute to disease diagnosis and drug design. There have been some experimental and computational methods designed to identify essential proteins , however , the prediction precision remains to be improved. In this paper , we propose a new method for identifying essential proteins based on Participation degree of a protein in protein Complexes and Subgraph Density , named as PCSD. In order to test the performance of PCSD , four PPI datasets ( DIP , Krogan , MIPS and Gavin) are used to conduct experiments. The experiment results have demonstrated that PCSD achieves a better performance for predicting essential proteins compared with some competing methods including DC , SC , EC , IC , LAC , NC , WDC , PeC , UDoNC , and compared with the most recent method LBCC , PCSD can correctly predict more essential proteins from certain numbers of top ranked proteins on the DIP dataset , which indicates that PCSD is very effective in discovering essential proteins in most case.
