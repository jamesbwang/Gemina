  Degenerative joint conditions are often characterized by changes in articular cartilage and subchondral bone properties. These changes are often associated with subchondral plate thickness and trabecular bone morphology. Thus , evaluating subchondral bone integrity could provide essential insights for diagnosis of joint pathologies. This study investigates the potential of optical spectroscopy for characterizing human subchondral bone properties. Osteochondral samples ( n = 50) were extracted from human cadaver knees ( n = 13) at four anatomical locations and subjected to NIR spectroscopy. The samples were then imaged using micro-computed tomography to determine subchondral bone morphometric properties , including: plate thickness ( Sb.Th) , trabecular thickness ( Tb.Th) , volume fraction ( BV/TV) , and structure model index ( SMI). The relationship between the subchondral bone properties and spectral data in the 1
