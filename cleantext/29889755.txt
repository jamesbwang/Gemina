  To estimate whether performance of salpingectomy compared with standard tubal ligation for sterilization at the time of cesarean delivery increases operating time or complication rates. A randomized controlled noninferiority trial was performed at a single academic institution. Women undergoing planned cesarean delivery who desired sterilization were randomized to salpingectomy or standard tubal ligation. The primary outcome was length of time of the sterilization procedure , with the noninferiority margin set at 5 minutes. With a one-sided independent sample t test , to achieve a power of 90 % with an Î± of 0.05 , 18 women needed to complete each intervention. Forty-four women were enrolled , with 19 successfully undergoing salpingectomy and 18 undergoing standard tubal ligation. Salpingectomy could not be completed in 1 of 20 patients ( as a result of adhesions). Baseline demographics were equivalent between groups. Salpingectomy procedure time was noninferior to standard tubal ligation , with a mean difference of 0.5 minutes , with a mean sterilization procedure time of 5.6 minutes in the salpingectomy group and 6.1 minutes in the standard tubal ligation group ( P < .05 , one-sided 95 % CI upper bound 1.8 minutes). There was no difference between cesarean delivery with salpingectomy compared with cesarean delivery with standard tubal ligation in median total operating time ( 60 vs 68 minutes , P = .34) or estimated blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( 600 vs 700 mL , P = .09). No patients in either group required reoperation or readmission. Salpingectomy procedure time was not longer than standard tubal ligation during cesarean delivery , with a mean difference of 30 seconds. There was a high completion rate for salpingectomy ( 95 %) and no apparent increase in complications. Clinicaltrials.gov , NCT03028623.
