  Sea cucumbers , belonging to the phylum Echinodermata , have been valued for centuries as a nutritious and functional food with various bioactivities. Sea cucumbers can produce highly active substances , notably saponins , the main secondary metabolites , which are the basis of their chemical defense. The saponins are mostly triterpene glycosides with triterpenes or steroid in aglycone , which possess multiple biological properties including antitumor , hypolipidemic activity , improvement of nonalcoholic fatty liver , inhibition of fat accumulation , antihyperuricemia , promotion of bone<disease> marrow hematopoiesis , antihypertension , etc.. Sea cucumber saponins have received attention due to their rich sources , low toxicity , high efficiency , and few side effects. This review summarizes current research on the structure and activities of sea cucumber saponins based on the physiological and pharmacological activities from source , experimental models , efficacy , and mechanisms , which may provide a valuable reference for the development of sea cucumber saponins.
