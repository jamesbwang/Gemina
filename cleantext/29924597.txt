  Phenotypes are established by tight regulation on protein functions. This regulation can be mediated allosterically , through protein binding , and covalently , through post-translational modification ( PTM). The integration of an ever-increasing number of PTMs into regulatory networks enables and defines the proteome complexity. Protein PTMs can occur enzymatically and nonenzymatically. Polyphosphorylation , which is a recently discovered PTM that belongs to the latter category , is the covalent attachment of the linear ortho-phosphate polymer called inorganic polyphosphate ( polyP) to lysine residues. PolyP , which is ubiquitously present in nature , is also known to allosterically control protein function. To date , lack of reagents has prevented the systematic analysis of proteins covalently and/or allosterically associated with polyP. Here , we report on the chemical synthesis of biotin-modified monodisperse short-chain polyP ( bio-polyP8-bio) and its subsequent use to screen a human proteome array to identify proteins that associate with polyP , thereby starting to define the human polyP-ome.
