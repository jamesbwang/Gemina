  Persistent apical periodontitis<disease> ( AP) is a situation involving an inflammatory and immune response caused mainly by anaerobic polymicrobial infection of the root canal system and the outcome and follow-up of the root canal treatment has been reported as intimately related to host response. The apical periodontitis<disease> repair might be associated with genetic polymorphisms. This study aimed to evaluate the association between HIF1A genetic polymorphisms ( rs2301113 and rs2057482) with PAP in Brazilian patients. Subjects with at least 1 year of follow-up after root canal therapy ( RCT) were recalled. Sixty-four subjects with signs/symptoms of PAP and 84 subjects with root canal-treated teeth exhibiting healthy perirradicular tissues ( healed) were included. Genomic DNA was extracted from saliva and used for HIF1A genotyping by real-time PCR. Genotype and allele frequencies were compared by c2 or Fisher 's exact tests and odds ratio was implemented , using Epi Info 3.5.2. All tests were performed with an established alpha of 0.05. There was no association between allele and genotype distribution for HIF1As polymorphisms and PAP ( p > 0.05). The genetic polymorphisms in HIF1A were not associated with persistent apical
