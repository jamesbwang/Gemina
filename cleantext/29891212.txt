  We determined the possible effects of a peripherally acting α Randomized , experimental , blinded crossover study. Six healthy Beagle dogs. Two IM treatments were administered: 1) medetomidine hydrochloride ( 20 μg kg Data from five dogs were analyzed. Heart rate was significantly higher from 20 to 90 minutes after MBM-MK. The T MK-467 accelerated the absorption of IM coadministered drugs. This is clinically relevant as it may hasten the onset of peak sedative effects.
