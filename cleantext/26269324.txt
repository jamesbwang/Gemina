  The UK Palliative Medicine Syllabus is critically evaluated to assess its relationship and relevance to contemporary palliative care policy and direction. Three criteria are employed for this review: ( 1) relevance to non-cancer dying , ageing , caregivers , and bereaved populations; ( 2) uptake and adoption of well-being models of public health alongside traditional illness and disease models of clinical understanding; and ( 3) uptake and integration of public health insights and methodologies for social support. We conclude that the current syllabus falls dramatically short on all 3 criteria. Suggestions are made for future consultation and revision.
