  In this study , optimization of growth , lipid and DHA production of Aurantiochytrium SW1 was carried out using response surface methodology ( RSM) in optimizing initial fructose concentration , agitation speed and monosodium glutamate ( MSG) concentration. Central composite design was applied as the experimental design and analysis of variance ( ANOVA) was used to analyze the data. ANOVA analysis revealed that the process which adequately represented by quadratic model was significant ( p < 0.0001) for all the response. All the three factors were significant ( p < 0.005) in influencing the biomass and lipid data while only two factors ( agitation speed and MSG) gave significant effect on DHA production ( p < 0.005). The estimated optimal conditions for enhanced growth , lipid and DHA production were 70 g/L fructose , 250 rpm agitation speed and 10 g/L MSG. Consequently , the quadratic model was validated by applying the estimated optimum conditions , which confirmed the model validity where 19.0 g/L biomass , 9.13 g/L lipid and 4.75 g/L of DHA were produced. The growth , lipid and DHA were 28 , 36 and 35 % respectively higher than that produced in the original medium prior to optimization.
