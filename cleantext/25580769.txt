  The phytohormones brassinosteroid ( BR) , auxin , and gibberellin ( GA) regulate photomorphogenesis-related hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis via the co-operative interaction of BZR-ARF-PIF/DELLA ( BAP/D) transcription factors/regulators. In addition , ethylene activates the PIF3 or ERF1 pathway through EIN3/EIL1 to balance hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis seedlings. However , the mechanism by which ethylene is co-ordinated with other phytohormones to produce light-regulated hypocotyl growth remains elusive. In this study , we found that hypocotyl cell elongation is regulated by a network involving ethylene , auxin , and BR signalling , which is mediated by interactions among ERF72 , ARF6 , and BZR1. ERF72 interacted directly with ARF6 and BZR1 in vitro and in vivo , and it antagonised regulation by ARF6 and BZR1 of the transcription of BEE3 and XTH7. In addition , light modulated the subcellular localisation of ERF72 and transcription of ERF72 through the EIN2-EIN3/ EIL1 pathway , facilitating the function of ERF72 in photomorphogenesis. The expression of BEE3 and XTH7 was also regulated by the EIN2-EIN3/ EIL1 pathway. Our findings indicate that a revised BZR-ARF-PIF/DELLA-ERF ( BAP/DE) module integrates light and hormone signals to regulate hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis.
