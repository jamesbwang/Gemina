  To assess the association between champagne bottle neck sign ( CBNS) in carotid artery and intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> in patients with moyamoya disease ( MMD). From January 2016 to December 2017 , a total of 76 consecutive patients with MMD without definite risk factors associated intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> who underwent preoperative angiography were included in this retrospective study. CBNS was defined as luminal diameter of internal carotid artery ( ICA)/ common carotid artery ( CCA) ≤ 0.5 on angiographic imaging. The right and left cerebral hemisphere in each patient was separately identified as hemorrhagic and none-hemorrhagic. The association between CBNS and intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> was analyzed. Of 76 MMD patients , intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> was found in 44 ( 28.9 %) hemispheres of 152 and 6.8 % ( 3/44) had multiple events. Compared carotid arteries without intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> in the ipsilateral hemispheres , those with intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> in the ipsilateral hemispheres had significantly smaller luminal diameter ratio of ICA/CCA ( 0.49 ± 0.11 vs. 0.55 ± 0.12 , p < 0.01) and higher prevalence of CBNS ( 63.7 % vs. 41.7 % , p = 0.01). For hemispheres with intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> , those with ipsilateral carotid artery CBNS had significantly higher prevalence of hemorrhage<symptom> at posterior territories than those without ( 57.1 % vs. 23.1 % , p = 0.05). Logistic regression revealed that CBNS was significantly associated with ipsilateral intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> before ( OR , 2.45; 95 % CI , 1.19-5.05; p = 0.02) and after ( OR , 3.43; 95 % CI , 1.50-7.87; p < 0.01) adjusted for female , lenticulostriate anastomosis , and choroidal anastomosis. CBNS is significantly associated with intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> at ipsilateral hemisphere in MMD patients , particularly for intracranial hemorrhage<symptom> at posterior territories.
