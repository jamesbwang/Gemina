  Minimally invasive esophagectomy ( MIE) has been introduced at many centers worldwide as evidence is accumulating that it reduces the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality and decreases the length of hospital stay compared to conventional open esophagectomy. The study is a single institution cohort study of 366 consecutive patients treated with curative intent for cancer in the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction , comparing MIE to open surgery. The outcomes studied were peroperative bleeding , operation time , lymph node yield , complications , length of stay and overall survival. The results showed that MIE was associated with reduced peroperative bleeding and operation time. The patients in the MIE group had a statistically significant reduced risk of postoperative complications , 60.2 % compared to 78.8 % in the open group. In the MIE group 28.4 % of the patients had postoperative complications classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification system as grade IIIb-V compared to 38.2 % in the open group , P = 0.046. Median hospital stay was reduced with 10 days comparing MIE to open surgery , P < 0.001. Mean number of resected lymph nodes was 31 in the MIE group and 22 in the open group ( P < 0.001) , while the R0 resections were 91.5 % versus 85 % ( P = 0.057). Overall long-term survival was higher in the MIE group , a difference that however did not reach statistical significance ( adjusted hazard ratio for three-year survival 0.76 , 95 % CI 0.54-1.08). In conclusion , MIE at a high volume center with a devoted specialist team reduces the risk of peroperative bleeding , operation time , and severe postoperative complications compared to open surgery for esophageal or junctional cancer. The number of resected lymph nodes was increased and the R0 resections were similar between the groups indicating a good oncological quality of the surgery.
