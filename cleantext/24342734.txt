  Ameloblastic carcinoma is considered to be a rare epithelial malignant neoplasm of odontogenic origin occurring mainly in the mandible. Ameloblastic carcinoma has been a topic of controversy regarding management from past many years. We reviewed 86 cases of mandibular ameloblastic carcinoma from 1981 to 2014 , on the basis of the electronic search of peer-reviewed journals in MEDLINE ( PubMed) database. Age , sex , tumor size , treatment delivered , recurrence , metastasis , follow-up period , and dead/alive status are tabulated , and the data are analyzed. The mean age was 43.47 years with standard deviation Â± 21.09. The age range was between 15 and 91 years , and male to female ratio was 2.18:1. Knowledge gained from the present review would help in establishing the best therapeutic options for ameloblastic carcinoma , and it also encourages the further reporting of ameloblastic carcinoma.
