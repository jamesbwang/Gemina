  Despite the rapid development of imaging techniques , precise probe localization and modulation in living cells is still a challenging task. Here we show that the simple hybridization between a photochromic fluorescent glycoprobe and human serum albumin ( HSA) enables a unique fluorescence `` double-check '' mechanism for precisely localizing and manipulating probe molecules in living cells. Docking of a carbohydrate-modified naphthalimide ( Naph)- spiropyran ( SP) dyad to a hydrophobic pocket of HSA produces the glycoprobe-protein hybrid , causing the protein conformation to fold as determined by small-angle X-ray scattering. We show that the Naph and merocyanine ( the photoisomer of SP) fluorescence of the resulting hybrid can be reversibly switched by light in buffer solution and in target cells overexpressing the carbohydrate receptor.
