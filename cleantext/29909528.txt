  To compare the surface of computer-aided design ( CAD) models of the maxilla produced using ultra-low MDCT doses combined with filtered backprojection ( FBP) , adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction ( ASIR) and model-based iterative reconstruction ( MBIR) reconstruction techniques with that produced from a standard dose/FBP protocol. A cadaveric completely edentulous maxilla was imaged using a standard dose protocol ( CTDIvol: 29.4 mGy) and FBP , in addition to 5 low dose test protocols ( LD1-5) ( CTDIvol: 4.19 , 2.64 , 0.99 , 0.53 , and 0.29 mGy) reconstructed with FBP , ASIR 50 , ASIR 100 , and MBIR. A CAD model from each test protocol was superimposed onto the reference model using the ` Best Fit Alignment ' function. Differences between the test and reference models were analyzed as maximum and mean deviations , and root-mean-square of the deviations , and color-coded models were obtained which demonstrated the location , magnitude and direction of the deviations. Based upon the magnitude , size , and distribution of areas of deviations , CAD models from the following protocols were comparable to the reference model: FBP/LD1; ASIR 50/LD1 and LD2; ASIR 100/LD1 , LD2 , and LD3; MBIR/LD1. The following protocols demonstrated deviations mostly between 1-2 mm or under 1 mm but over large areas , and so their effect on surgical guide accuracy is questionable: FBP/LD2; MBIR/LD2 , LD3 , LD4 , and LD5. The following protocols demonstrated large deviations over large areas and therefore were not comparable to the reference model: FBP/LD3 , LD4 , and LD5; ASIR 50/LD3 , LD4 , and LD5; ASIR 100/LD4 , and LD5. When MDCT is used for CAD models of the jaws , dose reductions of 86 % may be possible with FBP , 91 % with ASIR 50 , and 97 % with ASIR 100. Analysis of the stability and accuracy of CAD/CAM surgical guides as directly related to the jaws is needed to confirm the results.
