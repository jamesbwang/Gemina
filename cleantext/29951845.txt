  Although the PAO/phyllobilin pathway of chlorophyll breakdown is active in grass leaf senescence , the abundance of phyllobilins is far below the amount of degraded chlorophyll. The yellowing of fully developed leaves is the most prominent visual symptom of plant senescence. Thereby , chlorophyll is degraded via the so-called pheophorbide a oxygenase ( PAO)/ phyllobilin pathway to a species-specific set of phyllobilins , linear tetrapyrrolic products of chlorophyll breakdown. Here , we investigated the diversity and abundance of phyllobilins in cereal and forage crops , i.e. barley , rice , ryegrass , sorghum and wheat , using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of thirteen phyllobilins were identified , among them four novel , not yet described ones , pointing to a rather high diversity of phyllobilin-modifying activities present in the Gramineae. Along with these phyllobilins , barley orthologs of known Arabidopsis thaliana chlorophyll catabolic enzymes were demonstrated to localize in the chloroplast , and two of them , i.e. PAO and pheophytin pheophorbide hydrolase , complemented respective Arabidopsis mutants. These data confirm functionality of the PAO/phyllobilin pathway in grasses. Interestingly , when comparing phyllobilin abundance with amounts of degraded chlorophyll in senescent leaves , in most analyzed grass species only minor fractions of chlorophyll were recovered as phyllobilins , opposite to A. thaliana where phyllobilin quantities match degraded chlorophyll rather well. These data show that , despite the presence and activity of the PAO/phyllobilin pathway in barley ( and other cereals) , phyllobilins do not accumulate stoichiometrically , implying possible degradation of chlorophyll beyond the phyllobilin level.
