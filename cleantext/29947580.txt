  In general , people prefer to view themselves positively. But some individuals are more prone to self-flattery than others , that is , holding an unjustifiably high opinion of oneself. Applying regulatory mode theory , we identify motivational factors that predict which individuals are and are not prone to self-flattery. In four studies , using both chronic ( Studies 1-3) and experimental ( Study 4) conditions , we found that those with high locomotion concerns about effecting change ( control) are more inclined to flatter themselves , whereas those with high assessment concerns about making the right choices ( truth) are less inclined to flatter themselves. The relation between stronger locomotion and greater self-flattery , and stronger assessment and lesser self-flattery , was mediated by locomotors ' low self-criticism and assessors ' high self-criticism. These results shed light on how locomotion and assessment differ in the motivation to flatter oneself.
