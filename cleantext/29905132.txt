  We focus on surrogate decision making and , specifically , the topic of cosmetic outcomes following burn injury in a case in which potential surrogates dispute what the patient would have wanted. In particular , we examine the choice and role of surrogate decision makers in light of ethical principles that guide surrogate decision making. We also examine whether and when cosmesis should enter into goals of care discussions and consider potential roles cosmetic outcomes could play in such discussions. Finally , we discuss how caregivers should respond when surrogate decision makers suggest cosmetic results as a reason for withdrawing care.
