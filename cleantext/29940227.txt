  Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS) pathways are protocolled collections of perioperative decisions designed to improve outcomes that are becoming increasingly popular across surgical subspecialties. In this article , we review five recent manuscripts focused on ERAS for elective pulmonary resections , focusing on the components of the pathways and the resultant outcomes. Overall , we observed that ERAS protocols can be safely implemented without increasing hospital readmission or mortality. The benefit is largely seen in shortened length of stay , though there is some promise for decreasing rates of important perioperative complications , especially in patients receiving thoracotomies. More research is needed into the specific elements that impact care , as well as the effect on overall patient experience.
