  Our study focused on the RANKL ( receptor activator of nuclear factor-ÎºB ligand)/ RANK/OPG ( osteoprotegerin) axis and selected proinflammatory/immunoregulatory upstream mediators in the peripheral blood ( PBL) and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) of multiple sclerosis ( MS) patients. PBL and CSF were collected from healthy controls ( n = 35) and MS patients at the clinical onset of the disease ( n = 33). In addition , PBL samples were obtained from relapse-remitting ( RR)- MS patients ( n = 30). Patients were assessed by means of the expanded disability status scale ( EDSS) and routine laboratory parameters. Soluble ( s) RANKL and OPG were measured in the CSF and plasma; gene expression was detected for RANKL , RANK , OPG , and selected cytokines/chemokines ( interleukin ( IL) -4 , IL-10 , IL-17 , CCL2 , and CXCL12) in PBL mononuclear cells. The OPG level in the CSF was lower in MS patients at clinical onset than in controls. Moreover , the sRANKL/OPG ratio was higher in the CSF of MS patients at clinical onset and in the plasma of RR-MS patients than in controls. Gene expression of RANKL/RANK/OPG in PBL mononuclear cells was higher only in RR-MS patients. IL-4 , CCL2 , and CXCL12 were positively correlated and IL-10 was negatively correlated with RANKL/RANK expression. OPG was negatively correlated with EDSS and alkaline phosphatase level. Our study revealed that changes of RANKL/RANK/OPG axis are associated with MS , particularly the decreased OPG level in the CSF at disease onset. Therefore , these factors may serve as disease biomarkers and molecular targets of novel therapeutic approaches.
