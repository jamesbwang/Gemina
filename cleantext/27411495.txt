  The deposit patterns derived from droplet evaporation allow current development of medical tests and new strategies for diagnostic in patients. For such purpose , the development and implementation of algorithms capable of characterizing and differentiating deposits are crucial elements. We report the study of deposit patterns formed by the droplet evaporation of binary mixtures of proteins containing NaCl. Optical microscopy reveals aggregates such as tip arrow-shaped , dendritic and semi-rosette patterns , needle-like and scalloped lines structures , as well as star-like and prism-shaped salt crystals. We use the first-order statistics ( FOS) and gray level co-occurrence matrix ( GLCM) to characterize the complex texture of deposit patterns. Three significant findings arise from this analysis: first , the FOS and GLCM parameters structurally characterize protein deposits. Secondly , they conform to simple exponential laws that change as a function of the NaCl concentration. Finally , the parameters are capable of revealing the different structural changes that occur during the droplet evaporation.
