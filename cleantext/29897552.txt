  Management options for cystic echinococcosis ( CE) remain a serious problem. The main aim of this study was to examine the selection and complications of treatment applied in patients with CE. The second aim was to evaluate the mortality rate and causative factors. A retrospective descriptive study of patients diagnosed with CE between 1998 and 2015 was conducted , according to ICD-9 ( code 122 · 0 to 122 · 9) criteria in the Complejo Asistencial Universitario of Salamanca , Spain. Four-hundred-ninety-one ( 491) patients were diagnosed with CE disease and the treatment applied in these patients were: 166 ( 33.8 %) patients received only surgery , 176 ( 35.8 %) surgery and drugs , 17 ( 3.5 %) drugs alone , in 131 ( 26.7 %) patients the strategy was ` watch and wait ' , and only one patient ( 0.2 %) was applied puncture-aspiration-injection-respiration ( PAIR). Thus , a total of 342 patients received surgery , either alone ( 166) or combined with drugs ( 176) , and a total of 193 ( 39.4 %) patients were medically treated , either alone ( 17) or combined with surgery ( 176); 123 ( 63.7 %) patients used albendazole alone; and 70 ( 36.3 %) patients used a combination of albendazole and praziquantel. Sixty-five patients ( 19.0 %) had complications after surgery and seven of them ( 2 %) died. Only 15 ( 7.8 %) cases had side effects from anthelmintics. Throughout the study period , 80 ( 16.3 %) patients died , 14 ( 2.9 %) of them due to CE disease. Complications of CE are one of the most common causes of mortality in CE patients , with size , location , and number of cysts<symptom> , and the ` watch and wait ' treatment strategy being the main factors associated with mortality.
