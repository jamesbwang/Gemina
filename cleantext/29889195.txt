  Monolithic honeycomb structures have been attractive to multidisciplinary fields due to their high strength-to-weight ratio. Particularly , microhoneycomb monoliths ( MHMs) with micrometer-scale channels are expected as efficient platforms for reactions and separations because of their large surface areas. Up to now , MHMs have been prepared by a unidirectional freeze-drying ( UDF) method only from very limited precursors. Herein , we report a protocol from which a series of MHMs consisting of different components can be obtained. Recently , we found that cellulose nanofibers function as a distinct structure-directing agent towards the formation of MHMs through the UDF process. By mixing the cellulose nanofibers with water soluble substances which do not yield MHMs , a variety of composite MHMs can be prepared. This significantly enriches the chemical constitution of MHMs towards versatile applications.
