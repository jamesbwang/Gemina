  To establish whether there is cone contribution to retinal function and structure in chinchillas ( Chinchilla lanigera) , in view of the prevailing notion that this species possesses a pure rod retina. Photopic electroretinography ( ERG) responses to high-intensity flashes ( 10 and 25 cd * s/m ERG recordings revealed photopic responses , albeit of low amplitudes. Histopathology demonstrated presumptive cone inner segments in the photoreceptor layer. Presence of cone photoreceptors was confirmed by IHC. Cone density was higher in the central retina , and red/green cones outnumbered blue cones. Our results provide convincing evidence for the presence of functioning cone photoreceptors in the chinchilla retina , disproving the established belief that the species has a pure rod retina.
