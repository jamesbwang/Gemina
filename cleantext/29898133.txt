  The article surveys the `` scientific solutions '' proposed to address droughts in Brazil 's semi-arid sertão and frames them within a historical context characterized by scientificism , which then governed Brazilian and Western intellectual thought. It investigates how `` men of science '' devised theories and practices regarding the region 's nature and sertão society. From this perspective , the article examines the process by which the semi-arid sertão was settled; droughts since the colonial period; the social , political , and economic impact of the great drought of 1877-1879; debates and projects related to the scourge of drought; and the construction of the discourse of drought as a regional and national problem.
