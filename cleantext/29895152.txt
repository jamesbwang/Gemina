  Amalgaviridae is a family of double-stranded , monosegmented RNA viruses that are associated with plants , fungi<pathogen> , microsporidians , and animals. A sequence contig derived from the transcriptome of a eudicot , Cistus incanus ( the family Cistaceae; commonly known as hoary rockrose) , was identified as the genome sequence of a novel plant RNA virus and named Cistus incanus RNA virus 1 ( CiRV1). Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis indicated that CiRV1 is a novel species of the genus Amalgavirus in the family Amalgaviridae. The CiRV1 genome contig has two overlapping open reading frames ( ORFs). ORF1 encodes a putative replication factory matrix-like protein , while ORF2 encodes a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRp) domain. An ORF1 +2 fusion protein , which functions in viral RNA replication , is produced by a +1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting ( PRF) mechanism. A +1 PRF motif UUU_CGU , which matches the conserved amalgavirus +1 PRF consensus sequence UUU_CGN , was found at the boundary of CiRV1 ORF1 and ORF2. Comparison of 25 amalgavirus ORF1 +2 fusion proteins revealed that only three different positions within a 13-amino acid segment were recurrently used at the boundary , possibly being selected so as not to interfere with correct folding and function of the fusion protein. CiRV1 is the first virus found to be associated with the Cistus species and may be useful for studying amalgaviruses.
