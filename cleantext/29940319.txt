  The dynamic nature of the oil-water interface allows for sequestration of material within the dispersed domains of a microemulsion. Microstructural changes should therefore change the dissolution rate of a solid surface in a microemulsion. We hypothesize that microstructural changes due to formulation and cavitation in an acoustic field will enable control over solid dissolution rates. Water-in-oil microemulsions were formulated using cyclohexane , water , Triton X-100 , and hexanol. The microstructure and solvation properties of Winsor Type IV formulations were characterized. Dissolution rates of KH Dispersed aqueous domains of 2-6 nm radius dissolve a solid block of KDP at 0-10 nm/min. Dissolution rate is governed not by the domain-surface collision frequency but rather by a dissolution probability per domain-surface encounter. Higher probabilities are correlated with larger domains. Rapid and reversible dissolution rate increases of up to 270 Ã— were observed under ultrasonic conditions , with < 20 % of the increase due to bulk heating effects. The rest is attributed to cavitation-induced changes to the domain microstructure , providing a simple method for remotely activating and de-activating dissolution.
