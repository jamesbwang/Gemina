  Each odorant receptor corresponds to a unique glomerulus in the brain. Projections from different glomeruli then converge in higher brain regions , but we do not understand the logic governing which glomeruli converge and which do not. Here , we use two-photon optogenetics to map glomerular connections onto neurons in the lateral horn , the region of the Drosophila brain that receives the majority of olfactory projections. We identify 39 morphological types of lateral horn neurons ( LHNs) and show that different types receive input from different combinations of glomeruli. We find that different LHN types do not have independent inputs; rather , certain combinations of glomeruli converge onto many of the same LHNs and so are over-represented. Notably , many over-represented combinations are composed of glomeruli that prefer chemically dissimilar ligands whose co-occurrence indicates a behaviorally relevant `` odor scene. '' The pattern of glomerulus-LHN connections thus represents a prediction of what ligand combinations will be most salient.
