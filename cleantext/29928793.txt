  Although significant progress has been achieved in understanding of ion-exchange mechanisms in the new family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides known as MXenes , direct gravimetric assessment of water insertion into the MXene interlayer spaces and mesopores has not been reported so far. Concurrently , the latest research on MXene and Birnessite electrodes shows that nanoconfined water dramatically improves their gravimetric capacity and rate capability. Hence , quantification of the amount of confined water in solvated electrodes is becoming an important goal of energy-related research. Using the recently developed and highly sensitive method of in situ hydrodynamic spectroscopy ( based on surface-acoustic probing of solvated interfaces) , we provide clear evidence that typical cosmotropic cations ( Li
