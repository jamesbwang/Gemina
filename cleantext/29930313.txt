  Diet-induced weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( WL) leads to a compensatory increase in appetite<symptom> and changes in the plasma concentration of appetite-regulating hormones are likely to play a role. Whether these changes are transient or sustained remains unclear. This study aimed to assess if changes in subjective and objective appetite<symptom> markers observed with WL are sustained after 1 year ( 1Y). In total 100 ( 45 males) individuals with obesity ( BMI: 37 ± 4 kg/m At Wk13 , 16 % WL ( -18 ± 1 kg , P < 0.001) was associated with a significant increase in fasting and postprandial hunger ratings ( P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 , respectively) , and postprandial fullness ( P < 0.01) combined with a reduction in PFC ( P < 0.001). These were accompanied by a significant rise in basal and postprandial AG concentrations ( P < 0.001 , for both) , a reduction in postprandial CCK ( P < 0.01) and in basal and postprandial insulin ( P < 0.001). At 1Y follow-up , with sustained WL ( 15 %; -16 ± 1 kg , P < 0.001) , fasting hunger and postprandial fullness ratings remained increased ( P < 0.05 for both) , and postprandial PFC reduced ( P < 0.001). Basal and postprandial AG remained elevated and insulin reduced ( P < 0.001 , for all) , while postprandial CCK was increased ( P < 0.01) and PYY decreased ( P < 0.001). With a 15 % sustained WL at 1Y , the drive to eat in the fasting state is increased , but this may be balanced out by raised postprandial feelings of fullness. To assist with WL maintenance , new strategies are required to manage increased hunger and drive to eat.
