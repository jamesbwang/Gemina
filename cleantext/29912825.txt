  To evaluate the association between signal changes during intraoperative audiologic monitoring and postoperative audiometric outcome in patients undergoing vestibular schwannoma ( VS) resection via middle cranial fossa ( MCF) approach. Retrospective chart review. Academic tertiary referral center. One hundred twenty-six consecutive patients ( mean age 48.6 yrs , range 16-67; mean tumor size 9.9 mm , range 1.8-18.9 mm) who underwent MCF VS resection. Intraoperative audiologic monitoring using auditory brainstem response ( ABR) and direct cochlear nerve action potential ( CNAP). Intraoperative ABR wave V and CNAP N1 amplitudes and postoperative pure-tone average ( PTA) and word recognition score ( WRS). On ABR , absent wave V amplitude was associated with an 81.1 % increase and 82.3 % decrease in postoperative PTA and WRS , respectively. On CNAP , decreased or absent N1 amplitude was associated with 47.3 and 100 % increase , respectively , in postoperative PTA , and 45.3 % and 100 % decrease , respectively , in postoperative WRS. Receiver-operating curve analysis showed that ABR combined with CNAP using a Cueva electrode achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy in predicting postoperative hearing decline when measured by WRS class ( sensitivity 83.3 % , specificity 100 %) , and performed better compared with each modality alone. Intraoperative ABR wave V and CNAP amplitude changes are associated with changes in postoperative hearing , and dual modality monitoring was more diagnostic of postoperative hearing decline compared with each modality alone during MCF VS resection. Overall , intraoperative ABR and CNAP were more specific than sensitive for postoperative hearing decline.
