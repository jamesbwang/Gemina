  The treatment options for metastatic malignant melanoma have drastically changed recently , including the increased use of immunotherapeutic agents that offer significant responses. Accordingly , it hasbecome common for sequential administration of such agents. Despite this , no guidelines exist on propersequencing or potential unique toxicities associated with such sequencing. We describe here the first incidence , to our knowledge , of clinically significant rhabdomyolysis associated with high-dose interleukin-2 after prior treatment with ipilimumab , genetically engineered T-cell therapy and subsequent single agent pembrolizumab in a patient with BRAF wild type metastatic malignant melanoma. Further studies into the biology of sequential immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer are warranted.
