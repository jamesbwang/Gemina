  High mobility group box-1 ( HMGB1) could function as an early trigger for pro-inflammatory activation following spinal cord injury ( SCI). Spinal cord edema<symptom> contributes to inflammatory response mechanisms and a poor clinical prognosis following SCI , for which efficient therapies targeting the specific molecules involved remain limited. This study was designed to evaluate the roles of HMGB1 on the regulation of early spinal cord edema<symptom> , astrocyte activation and aquaporin-4 ( AQP4) expression in a rat SCI model. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to laminectomy at T10 , and the SCI model was induced by a heavy falling object. Following SCI , rats received ethyl pyruvate ( EP) or glycyrrhizin ( GL) via an intraperitoneal injection to inhibit HMGB1. The effects of HMGB1 inhibition on the early spinal cord edema<symptom> , astrocyte activation ( glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP) expression) , and AQP4 expression following SCI ( 12h-3days) were analyzed. The results showed that EP or GL effectively inhibited HMGB1 expression in the spinal cord and HMGB1 levels in the serum of SCI rats. HMGB1 inhibition improved motor function , reduced spinal cord water content , and attenuated spinal cord edema<symptom> in SCI rats. HMGB1 inhibition decreased SCI-associated GFAP and AQP4 overexpression in the spinal cord. Furthermore , HMGB1 inhibition also repressed the activation of the toll-like receptor 4/ myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88/ nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway. These results implicate that HMGB1 inhibition improved locomotor function and reduced early spinal cord edema<symptom> , which was associated with a downregulation of astrocyte activation ( GFAP expression) and AQP4 expression in SCI rats.
