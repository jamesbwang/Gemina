  Cisplatin is an alkylating agent that interferes with DNA replication and kills proliferating carcinogenic cells. Several studies have been conducted to attenuate the side effects of cisplatin; one such side effect in cancer patients undergoing cisplatin chemotherapy is ototoxicity. However , owing to a lack of understanding of the precise mechanism underlying cisplatin-induced side effects , management of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity remains unsolved. We investigated the protective effects of fenofibrate , a PPAR-α activator , on cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Fenofibrate prevented cisplatin-induced loss of hair cells and improved cell viability; moreover , fenofibrate significantly attenuated the threshold of auditory brainstem responses ( ABR) in cisplatin-injected mice. Fenofibrate significantly increased PPAR-α , PPAR-γ , and PGC-1α expression , which consequently resulted in increased number and functional enzyme levels of peroxisomes and mitochondria , and markedly decreased phospho-p53 ( S15) , activated caspase-3 , cleaved-PARP , and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation , which reduced NADPH oxidase isoform ( NOX3 and NOX4) expression , thereby decreasing reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production in cisplatin-treated tissues ex vivo. Taken together , these results indicate that fenofibrate rescues cisplatin-induced ototoxicity by maintaining peroxisome and mitochondria number and function , reducing inflammation<symptom> , and decreasing ROS levels. Our findings suggest that fenofibrate administration might serve as an effective therapeutic agent against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.
