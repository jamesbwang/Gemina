  All organisms contain RNA modifications in their ribosomal RNA ( rRNA) , but the importance , positions and exact function of these are still not fully elucidated. Various functions such as stabilising structures , controlling ribosome assembly and facilitating interactions have been suggested and in some cases substantiated. Bacterial rRNA contains much fewer modifications than eukaryotic rRNA. The rRNA modification patterns in bacteria differ from each other , but too few organisms have been mapped to draw general conclusions. This study maps 23S ribosomal RNA modifications in Clostridium<pathogen> sporogenes<pathogen> that can be characterised as a non-toxin producing Clostridium<pathogen> botulinum<pathogen> Clostridia are able to sporulate and thereby survive harsh conditions , and are in general considered to be resilient to antibiotics. Selected regions of the 23S rRNA were investigated by mass spectrometry and by primer extension analysis to pinpoint modified sites and the nature of the modifications. Apparently , C.<pathogen> sporogenes<pathogen> 23S rRNA contains few modifications compared to other investigated bacteria. No modifications were identified in domain II and III of 23S rRNA. Three modifications were identified in domain IV , all of which have also been found in other organisms. Two unusual modifications were identified in domain V , methylated dihydrouridine at position U2449 and dihydrouridine at position U2500 ( Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> numbering) , in addition to four previously known modified positions. The enzymes responsible for the modifications were searched for in the C.<pathogen> sporogenes<pathogen> genome using BLAST with characterised enzymes as query. The search identified genes potentially coding for RNA modifying enzymes responsible for most of the found modifications.
