  Approximately 1-3 % of children have intellectual disability or global developmental delay. Heterozygous mutations have emerged as a major cause of different intellectual disability syndromes<disease>. In severely affected patients , reproductive fitness is impaired and mutations have usually arisen de novo. Massive parallel sequencing has been an effective means of diagnosing patients , especially those who carry a de novo mutation. The molecular diagnosis can be a way to shift from a more phenotype-driven management of the clinical signs to a more refined treatment based on genotype. Here , we report a novel dominantly inherited KAT6A missense variant in the C-terminal transactivation domain identified by exome sequencing in a girl and her father. Both had intellectual disability/developmental delay , short stature , microcephaly , and strabismus with the father being mildly affected. We here report the first inherited variant in KAT6A and suggest missense variants in KAT6A to be associated with an inheritable , milder clinical presentation compared to previously reported de novo , truncating mutations in this gene.
