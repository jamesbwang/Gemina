  Mycoplasma<pathogen> suis<pathogen> ( M. suis<pathogen>) is an uncultivable haemotrophic mycoplasma<pathogen> that parasitizes the red blood cells of a wide range of domestic and wild animals. Adhesion of M. suis<pathogen> to host erythrocytes is crucial for its unique RBC-dependent lifecycle. MSG1 protein ( now named as GAPDH) with homology to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH) was the first identified adhesion protein of M. suis<pathogen>. In this study , we found that O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase ( OSGEP) is another M. suis<pathogen> protein capable of binding porcine erythrocytes. Recombinant OSGEP expressed in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> demonstrated surface localization similar to GAPDH. Purified rOSGEP bound to erythrocyte membrane preparations in a dose-dependent manner and this adhesion could be specifically inhibited by anti-rOSGEP antibodies. E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> transformants expressing OSGEP on their surface were able to adhere to porcine erythrocytes. Furthermore , using far-western and pull-down assays , we determined the host membrane proteins that interacted with OSGEP and GAPDH were Band3 and glycophorin A ( GPA). In conclusion , our studies indicated that OSGEP and GAPDH could interact with both Band3 and GPA to mediate adhesion of M. suis<pathogen> to porcine erythrocytes.
