  Imaging of gliomas remains challenging. The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility of using Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for imaging gliomas. Fifteen patients with glioma from 2 centers were included in the study. Ten patients were treated cases of glioblastoma with suspected recurrence. Two patients were sent for assessing the nature ( primary lesion/metastasis) of space-occupying lesion<symptom> in the brain; 3 patients were imaged immediately after surgery and before radiotherapy. Target-to-background ratios ( TBR) for the brain lesions<symptom> were calculated using contralateral cerebellar uptake as background. Among the 10 cases with suspected recurrence , scan was positive in 9 , subsequent surgery was done , and histopathology proved it to be true recurrence. In the scan-negative case on follow-up , no evidence of disease could be made clinically or radiologically. Among the other cases the presence or absence of disease could be unequivocally identified on the Ga-PSMA-11 brain scan and correlated with the histopathology or other imaging. Apart from the visual assessment quantitative assessment of the lesions<symptom> with TBR also showed a significantly high TBR value for those with true disease compared with those with no disease. In the evaluation of gliomas , Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT brain imaging is a potentially useful imaging tool. The use of Ga-PSMA-11 brain PET/CT in evaluation of recurrent glioma seems promising. Absence of physiological uptake of Ga-PSMA-11 in the normal brain parenchyma results in high TBR values and consequently better visualization of glioma
