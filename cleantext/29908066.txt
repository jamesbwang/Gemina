  Jump tests assess lower body power production capacity , and can be used to evaluate athletic ability and development during growth. Wearable inertial measurement units ( IMU) seem to offer a feasible alternative to laboratory-based equipment for jump height assessments. Concurrent validity of these devices for jump height assessments has only been established in adults. Therefore , the purpose of this study was to evaluate the concurrent validity of IMU-based jump height estimate compared to contact mat-based jump height estimate in adolescents. Ninety-five adolescents ( 10-13 years-of-age; girls N = 41 , height = 154 ( SD 9) cm , weight = 44 ( 11) kg; boys N = 54 , height = 156 ( 10) cm , weight = 46 ( 13) kg) completed 3 counter-movement jumps for maximal jump height on a contact mat. Inertial recordings ( accelerations , rotations) were concurrently recorded with a hip-worn IMU ( sampling at 256 Hz). Jump height was evaluated based on flight time. The mean IMU-derived jump height was 27.1 ( SD 3.8) cm , and the corresponding mean jump-mat-derived value was 21.5 ( 3.4) cm. While a significant 26 % mean difference was observed between the methods ( 5.5 ( 95 % limits of agreement 2.2 to 8.9) cm , P = 0.006) , the correspondence between methods was excellent ( ICC = 0.89). The difference between methods was weakly positively associated with jump height ( r = 0.28 , P = 0.007). Take-off velocity-derived jump height was also explored but produced only fair congruence. In conclusion , IMU-derived jump height exhibited excellent congruence to contact mat-based jump height and therefore presents a feasible alternative for jump height assessments in adolescents.
