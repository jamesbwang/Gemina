  Vitamin D status has been associated with fetal growth and offspring 's bone mass in some observational studies. We characterize the trajectory of total maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D concentration by race and examine whether vitamin D status is associated with neonatal anthropometry and body composition as assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA). Three longitudinal pregnancy samples from the Memphis site of the Calcium for Preeclampsia Prevention trial ( 1992-1995) were used. Racial differences in total 25 ( OH) D trajectories ( n = 343 women) were tested using an interaction term between blood draw gestational week and race in linear mixed-effects models. Linear regression and linear mixed-effects models estimated the adjusted associations between total 25 ( OH) D concentration with neonatal anthropometry and body composition ( n = 252 with DXA) including interactions with infant sex and serum calcium. Total 25 ( OH) D concentration increased with gestational age , but its trajectory over pregnancy did not differ between African-American and Caucasian women. Deficient maternal vitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D concentration < 20 ng/ml) was associated with lower neonatal total bone mineral density ( Î² -0.009 g/cm Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is associated with lower bone density and smaller size at birth in certain subgroups suggesting its importance in fetal development.
