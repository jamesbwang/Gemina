  This post hoc pooled analysis assessed the effectiveness of green tea catechins ( GTC) to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) associated with abdominal fat reduction , because previous findings are unclear. Data were pooled from six human trials ( n = 921 , 505 men) comparing the effects of GTC-containing beverages ( 540-588 mg GTC/beverage) and a placebo beverage. Outcome measures were abdominal fat ( total fat area ( TFA) , visceral fat area ( VFA) , subcutaneous fat area ( SFA)) , and MetS risk. We estimated mean changes from baseline and calculated confidence intervals ( CI) to assess reductions in abdominal fat accumulation and MetS improvement. Subclass analyses were performed by classifying subjects as Pre-MetS or MetS at trial initiation. Additional subclass analyses were performed with Pre-MetS and MetS subjects further stratified according to whether GTC intake reduced TFA , VFA , or SFA. Consumption of GTC-containing beverages for 12 weeks significantly reduced TFA ( -17.7 cm
