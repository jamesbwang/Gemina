  The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of N-acetylcysteine ( NAC) on the expression of activin receptor-like kinase-1 ( ALK-1) and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 1 ( Smad1) in the pulmonary artery of rats with pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH) , and to explore the possible mechanisms underlying its effects on pulmonary vascular remodeling ( PVR). In total , 32 Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: Control , model , low-dose ( 100 mg/kg/day) NAC and high-dose ( 500 mg/kg/day) NAC. Monocrotaline ( MCT) was intraperitoneally injected to prepare the model , and the right ventricular hypertrophy index ( RVHI) and hemodynamic parameters were detected 6 weeks later. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe the pulmonary arterial structural changes and evaluate the peri-pulmonary artery inflammation<symptom> score. Additionally , western blot analysis was used to detect the protein expression of ALK-1 and Smad1 in the pulmonary artery. The results demonstrated that treatment with NAC reduced RVHI and mean pulmonary artery pressure. In addition , NAC reduced the MCT-induced PVR , pulmonary<symptom> inflammation<symptom> score and upregulation of ALK-1 and Smad1. These results indicate that ALK-1 and Smad1 participate in the formation of PAH and the process of PVR , and suggest that NAC may inhibit PAH by inhibiting the expression of ALK-1 and Smad1 in the pulmonary artery.
