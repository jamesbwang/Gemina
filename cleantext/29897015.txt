  Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 ( TREM-2) , a transmembrane receptor expressed by macrophages , microglia , and osteoclasts ( OCs) , plays a protective role in late-onset Alzheimer Disease ( AD). To validate TREM-2 as a therapeutic target in AD , its potential secondary parallel effect on bone homeostasis should be clarified. However , animal models and monolayer cultures of human cells were shown poorly predictive of TREM-2 function in human. Therefore , this study aimed to engineer a tridimensional in vitro model using human progenitors differentiated into osteoblasts and OCs , recapitulating physiological bone homeostasis. Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells were seeded and cultured under perfusion inside a collagen type I scaffold for 3 weeks , generating osteoblasts and mineralized matrix. Human peripheral blood-derived CD14
