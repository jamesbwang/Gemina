  Effects of compound Danshen injection combined with magnesium sulfate on serum myeloperoxidase ( MPO) and hypersensitive C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP) in patients with severe preeclampsia ( PE) were investigated. Five hundred patients with severe PE were randomly divided into early-onset observation , early-onset control , late-onset observation and late-onset control groups. Control group was treated with magnesium sulfate , while patients in observation group were treated with magnesium sulfate combined with compound Danshen injection. Serum levels of MPO and hs-CRP were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) and turbidimetric assay. The effects of compound Danshen injection combined with magnesium sulfate on the above indexes were observed. Serum levels of MPO and hs-CRP significantly decreased in early-onset observation , late-onset observation , early-onset control and late-onset control groups after treatment ( p < 0.05). After treatment , levels of MPO and hs-CRP were significantly lower in early-onset observation group than in early-onset control group ( p < 0.05) , and levels of MPO and hs-CRP were also significantly lower in late-onset observation group than in late-onset control group ( p < 0.05). Total effective rate of early-onset observation group and late-onset observation group were higher than that of early-onset control group and late-onset control group. Compound Danshen injection combined with magnesium sulfate achieved better treatment outcomes in the treatment of severe PE than magnesium sulfate alone. The combined treatment can effectively reduce the serum levels of MPO and hs-CRP.
