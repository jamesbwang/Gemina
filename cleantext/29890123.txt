  COPD is associated with cardiovascular disease ( CVD) , and coronary artery calcification ( CAC) provides additional prognostic information. With increasing use of nongated CT scans in clinical practice , this study hypothesized that the visual Weston CAC score would perform as well as the Agatston score in predicting prevalent and incident coronary artery disease ( CAD) and CVD in COPD. CAC was measured by using Agatston and Weston scores on baseline CT scans in 1,875 current and former smokers enrolled in the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD ( COPDGene) study. Baseline cardiovascular disease and incident cardiac events on longitudinal follow-up were recorded. Accuracy of the CAC scores was measured by using receiver-operating characteristic analysis , and Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to estimate the risk of incident cardiac events. CAD was reported by 133 ( 7.1 %) subjects at baseline. A total of 413 ( 22.0 %) and 241 ( 12.9 %) patients had significant CAC according to the Weston ( ≥ 7) and Agatston ( ≥ 400) scores , respectively; the two methods were significantly correlated ( r = 0.84; P < .001). Over 5 years of follow-up , 127 patients ( 6.8 %) developed incident CVD. For predicting prevalent CAD , c-indices for the Weston and Agatston scores were 0.78 and 0.74 and for predicting incident CVD , they were 0.62 and 0.61. After adjustment for age , race , sex , smoking pack-years , FEV A simple visual score for CAC performed well in predicting incident CAD in smokers with and without COPD.
