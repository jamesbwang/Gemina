  Mitophagy , the selective degradation of mitochondria via the autophagic pathway , is a vital mechanism of mitochondrial quality control in cells. The removal of malfunctioning or damaged mitochondria is essential for normal cellular physiology and tissue development. Stimulation of mitochondrial permeabilization and release of proapoptotic factors from the intermembrane space is an essential step in triggering the mitochondrial pathway of cell death. In this study , we analyzed the extent to which mitophagy interferes with cell death , attenuating the efficiency of cancer therapy. We show that stimulation of mitophagy suppressed cisplatin-induced apoptosis , while mitophagy inhibition stimulates apoptosis and autophagy. Suppression of mitophagy involved production of reactive oxygen species , and the fate of cell was dependent on the interplay between endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy.
