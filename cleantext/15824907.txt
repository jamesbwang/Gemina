  In this study , the effects of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium ( PGPR) , Bacillus<pathogen> sp.. JS on the growth of tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ` Xanthi ') and lettuce ( Lactuca sativa ` Crispa ') , were evaluated by comparing various growth parameters between plants treated with the bacterium<pathogen> and those exposed to water or nutrient broth as control. In both tobacco and lettuce , fresh weight and length of shoots were increased upon exposure to Bacillus<pathogen> sp.. JS. To explain the overall de novo expression of plant proteins by bacterial volatiles , two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed on samples from PGPR-treated tobacco plants. Our results showed that chlorophyll a/b binding proteins were significantly up-regulated , and total chlorophyll content was also increased. Our findings indicate the potential benefits of using Bacillus<pathogen> sp.. JS as a growth-promoting factor in agricultural practice , and highlight the need for further research to explore these benefits.
