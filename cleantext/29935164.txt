  Intestinal epithelial cell wound<disease> healing involves cell migration , proliferation , and differentiation. Although numerous studies have analyzed the migration of absorptive epithelial cells during wound<disease> healing , it remains unclear how goblet cells restitute and how MUC2 mucin production affects this process. In this study , we examined the role of high MUC2 production in goblet cell migration during wound<disease> healing and demonstrated that during high MUC2 output , goblet cells migrated slower because of impaired production of wound<disease> healing factors and endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress. Two goblet cell lines , HT29-H and HT29-L , that produced high and low MUC2 mucin , respectively , were used. HT29-L healed wounds<disease> faster than HT29-H cells by producing significantly higher amounts of fibroblast growth factor ( FGF) 1 , FGF2 , vascular endothelial growth factor-C , and matrix metallopeptidase 1. Predictably , treatment of HT29-H cells with recombinant FGF2 significantly enhanced migration and wound<disease> healing. High MUC2 biosynthesis in HT29-H cells induced ER stress and delayed migration that was abrogated by inhibiting ER stress with tauroursodeoxycholic acid and IL-22. FGF2- and IL-22-induced wound<disease> repair was dependent on STAT1 and STAT3 signaling. During wound<disease> healing after dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis<disease> , restitution of Math1
