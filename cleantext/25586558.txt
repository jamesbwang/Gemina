  Antigen-specific immunoglobulin ( Ig) A plays a major role in host defense against infections in gut mucosal tissue. Follicular helper T ( Tfh) cells are located in germinal centers and promote IgA production via interactions with germinal center B cells. Several studies have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria ( LAB) strains activate the host 's acquired immune system , inducing IgA secretion in the intestine. However , the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of LAB on IgA production and Tfh cells are not fully resolved. Lactobacillus<pathogen> paracasei<pathogen> MCC1849 is a probiotic strain isolated from the intestine of a healthy adult In this study , we investigated the effects of orally administered heat-killed MCC1849 on IgA production in the intestine and on Tfh cell induction in vivo. We found that orally administered MCC1849 induced antigen-specific IgA production in the small intestine , serum and lungs. We also observed that MCC1849 increased the proportion of IgA + B cells and Tfh cells in Peyer 's patches ( PPs). In addition , MCC1849 increased the gene expression of IL-12p40 , IL-10 , IL-21 , STAT4 and Bcl-6 associated with Tfh cell differentiation. These results suggest that orally administered MCC1849 enhances antigen-specific IgA production and likely affects Tfh cell differentiation in PPs.
