  A divergent strategy for assembling pyrone diterpenes is presented. Capitalizing on the unique stereo- and chemoselectivity features of radical-based chemistry , the core decalin of these structures is efficiently forged using an electrochemically assisted oxidative radical polycyclization while key peripheral substituents are appended using decarboxylative radical cross couplings. In this way , access to four natural products ( subglutinols A/B , higginsianin A , and sesquicillin A) is achieved in a concise and stereocontrolled fashion that is modular and amenable to future medicinal chemistry explorations.
