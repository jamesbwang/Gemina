  Lipotoxicity plays an important role in the progression of chronic kidney damage via various mechanisms , such as endoplasmic reticulum stress. Several studies proposed renal lipotoxicity in glomerular and tubular cells but the effect of lipid on renal erythropoietin ( EPO)- producing ( REP) cells in the interstitium has not been elucidated. Since renal<symptom> anemia<symptom> is caused by derangement of EPO production in REP cells , we evaluated the effect of palmitate , a representative long-chain saturated fatty acid , on EPO production and the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. EPO production was suppressed by palmitate ( palmitate-conjugated bovine serum albumin ( BSA)) or a high palmitate diet , but not oleic acid-conjugated BSA or a high oleic acid diet , especially under cobalt-induced pseudo-hypoxia both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly , suppression of EPO production was not induced by a decrease in transcription factor HIF activity , while it was significantly associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress , particularly transcription factor ATF4 activation , which suppresses 3 '- enhancer activity of the EPO gene. ATF4 knockdown by siRNA significantly attenuated the suppressive effect of palmitate on EPO production. Studies utilizing inherited super-anemic mice ( ISAM) mated with EPO-Cre mice ( ISAM-REC mice) for lineage-labeling of REP cells showed that ATF4 activation by palmitate suppressed EPO production in REP cells. Laser capture microdissection confirmed ATF4 activation in the interstitial area of ISAM-REC mice treated with palmitate-conjugated BSA. Thus , endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by palmitate suppressed EPO expression by REP cells in a manner independent of HIF activation. The link between endoplasmic reticulum stress , dyslipidemia , and hypoxia may contribute to development and progression of anemia<symptom> in CKD.
