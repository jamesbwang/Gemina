  Digestive tract cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin are often associated with the development of peripheral neuropathy. The aim of the present study is to identify the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) in genes involved in oxaliplatin metabolism , cell cycle control , detoxification or excretion pathways with the development of oxaliplatin-induced acute peripheral neuropathy ( acute OXAIPN) and its severity among digestive tract cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. A total of 228 digestive tract cancer patients undergoing with the oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy between November 2014 and December 2016 were included in the current study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood by standard phenol-chloroform method. Genotyping of five SNPs in four genes ( GSTP We found that the two genetic variants rs2230641 and rs3093816 in cyclin H ( CCNH) gene were significantly associated with both the incidence and severity of acute OXAIPN. For CCNH-rs2230641 ( AA vs AG+GG; dominant model) Incidence: OR 2.62 , 95 % CI 1.44-4.75 , p = 0.001 , severity; OR 4.64 , 95 % CI 1.58-13.62 , p = 0.002. For CCNH-rs3093816 ( AA vs AG+GG; dominant model); incidence: OR 3.43 , 95 % CI 1.57-7.50 , p = 0.001; severity: OR 2.36 , 95 % CI 1.05-5.30 , p = 0.033. The results of the present study found significant association between CCNH polymorphisms and acute OXAIPN development. However , further studies are warranted from independent groups to validate our study results.
