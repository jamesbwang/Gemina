  Understanding the factors used by female cheetahs ( Acinonyx jubatus) to make mate choice decisions could benefit zoo breeding programs , which currently assign mates based primarily on genetic distance. Because transporting animals between institutions is costly and can be stressful , females are often limited in the number of males available for mating. One solution would be to determine if an easily transported substance could be used to gauge interest by a female to a potential mate. Here , we investigate female interest in urine samples from males of different genetic distances. Twelve females at five institutions were offered scents from 17 males of varying genetic relatedness in a pair-wise choice paradigm. Behavioral responses of the females were recorded to determine preference. Results showed that females spent more time sniffing and in proximity to scents from the most distantly related males , but female response was not influenced by male urine testosterone concentration , female parity , age , or estrous cycling. Further research will be necessary to determine whether a female 's interest in male urine translates to mate preference and acceptance before this technique can be applied to zoo breeding programs.
