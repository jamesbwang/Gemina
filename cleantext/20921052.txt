  Changing environments have the potential to alter the fitness of organisms through effects on components of fitness such as energy acquisition , metabolic cost , growth rate , survivorship , and reproductive output. Organisms , on the other hand , can alter aspects of their physiology and life histories through phenotypic plasticity as well as through genetic change in populations ( selection). Researchers examining the effects of environmental variables frequently concentrate on individual components of fitness , although methods exist to combine these into a population level estimate of average fitness , as the per capita rate of population growth for a set of identical individuals with a particular set of traits. Recent advances in energetic modeling have provided excellent data on energy intake and costs leading to growth , reproduction , and other life-history parameters; these in turn have consequences for survivorship at all life-history stages , and thus for fitness. Components of fitness alone ( performance measures) are useful in determining organism response to changing conditions , but are often not good predictors of fitness; they can differ in both form and magnitude , as demonstrated in our model. Here , we combine an energetics model for growth and allocation with a matrix model that calculates population growth rate for a group of individuals with a particular set of traits. We use intertidal mussels as an example , because data exist for some of the important energetic and life-history parameters , and because there is a hypothesized energetic trade-off between byssus production ( affecting survivorship) , and energy used for growth and reproduction. The model shows exactly how strong this trade-off is in terms of overall fitness , and it illustrates conditions where fitness components are good predictors of actual fitness , and cases where they are not. In addition , the model is used to examine the effects of environmental change on this trade-off and on both fitness and on individual fitness components.
