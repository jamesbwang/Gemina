  A low-temperature stage for X-ray powder diffraction in Bragg-Brentano reflection geometry is described. The temperature range covered is 40-315 K , with a temperature stability at the sample within Â± 0.1 K of the set point. The stage operates by means of a Gifford-McMahon ( GM) closed-cycle He refrigerator; it requires no refrigerants and so can run for an extended period ( in practice at least 5 d) without intervention by the user. The sample is cooled both by thermal conduction through the metal sample holder and by the presence of He exchange gas , at ambient pressure , within the sample chamber; the consumption of He gas is extremely low , being only 0.1 l min
