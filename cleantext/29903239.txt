  To develop a method for determination of bisphenol A in human blood by fast phospholipid removal solid phase extraction method-ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( UPLC-MS/MS). Enzymatic hydrolysis ( β-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase) and phospholipid removal solid phase extraction were used to treat the blood samples under the acidic condition , a Infinity Lab Poroshell 120 PFP column ( 100 mm × 3. 0 mm , 2. 7 μm) was used for LC separation , ESI negative ion scan was used with multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM) mode. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 0. 1-100 ng/mL for bisphenol A with correlation coefficients more than 0. 999. The limit of detection was 0. 05 ng/mL , the limit of quantity was 0. 15 ng/mL. The recoveries of the method for bisphenol A at three spiked levels of 0. 5 , 5 and 50 ng/mL ranged from 87. 3 % to 112. 1 %. The relative standard deviation ( RSD) of intra and inter day were range from3. 3 % -8. 2 % , 4. 9 % -10. 7 % ( n = 6) , respectively. The method is successfully applied in the analysis of bisphenol A in human blood with its simple operation , sensitivity and accuracy.
