  While there is a concerted effort to promote physical activity ( PA) across United States government and non-governmental organizations , interventions typically focus on aerobic forms of PA , leaving out muscle strengthening PA.. The purpose of this study was to operationalize the Reasoned Action Approach ( RAA) to explain theory-based correlates of aerobic and muscle strengthening PA , which can provide targets for future public health interventions. Theory-based correlates of both PA behaviors were evaluated using logistic regression analyses , and intentions predicted a significant amount of aerobic PA ( 14.9 %) and muscle strengthening PA ( 30.7 %). Theory-based correlates of intentions to both PA behaviors were evaluated using linear regression analyses , and attitudes , perceived norms , and perceived behavioral control predicted a significant amount for aerobic PA ( 46.2 % to 55.8 %) and for muscle strengthening PA ( 53.9 % to 59.8 %). Finally , theory-based correlates of attitudes , injunctive norms , descriptive norms and perceived behavioral control were evaluated using salient beliefs , derived from an elicitation study. Results suggest that the RAA is a robust framework for predicting both types of PA behaviors. Belief-based measures also provides guidance for future public health promotion interventions and health communication strategies.
