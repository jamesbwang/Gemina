  To examine the association between urinary cadmium levels and the incidence of ischemic stroke and to explore possible effect modifications. A case-cohort study was designed nested in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke ( REGARDS) study , including 680 adjudicated incident cases of ischemic stroke and 2,540 participants in a randomly selected subcohort. Urinary creatinine-corrected cadmium concentration was measured at baseline. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios ( HRs) and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were estimated with the Barlow weighting method for the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The median urinary cadmium concentration was 0.42 ( interquartile range 0.27-0.68) Î¼g/g creatinine. After adjustment for potential confounders , urinary cadmium was associated with increased incidence of ischemic stroke ( quintile 5 vs quintile 1: HR 1.50 , 95 % CI 1.01-2.22 , Findings from this study suggest that cadmium exposure may be an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke in the US general population. Never smoking and maintaining a high serum zinc level may ameliorate the potential adverse effects of cadmium exposure.
