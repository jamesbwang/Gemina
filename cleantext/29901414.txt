  This study longitudinally assessed 10-14-year-old patients with sports and recreational concussion ( n = 22) who remained symptomatic 3-4 weeks post-injury compared to typically developing controls ( n = 24). Examination by multimodal MRI and multidomain clinical outcome measures was completed at 1-month and 6-months post-injury. Concussion patients showed evidence of improvement by 6-month follow up in domains of cognitive function while measures of psychological health were less resolved with patients exhibiting sustained symptoms of depression<symptom> , behavior impairment<symptom> , and concussion symptoms. Quantitative neuroimaging measures identified measures indicative of chronic injury with regional reductions observed by both volumetric segmentation and white matter FA from DTI. Volumetric reductions ( p < 0.01) were observed in the middle anterior and posterior portions of the corpus callosum , and right caudal anterior cingulate cortex of patients although none held after strict correction. Examination of the FA data identified significant reductions in the left middle frontal gyrus white matter ( p = 0.0003). Linear regression analysis on the 6-month depression<symptom> outcome variable using the initial clinical , demographic , and imaging measures identified the top predictive models to include concussion diagnosis , and initial symptoms of depression<symptom> , concussion symptoms , and sleep impairment with additional contribution from other measures of mental health , behavior impairment<symptom> , and quality of life depending on the model , ( adjusted r-squared = 0.69 indicating strong predictive ability). This study supports further inclusion of mental health rehabilitation and imaging supplementing traditional cognitive rehabilitation strategies employed in these young athletes.
