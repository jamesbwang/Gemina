  Heparin resistance can be defined as high doses of unfractionated heparin ( UFH) , greater than 35,000 IU/day , required to raise the activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT) and activated coagulation time ( ACT) to within therapeutically desired ranges or the impossibility of doing so. The most common pathology responsible is the deficiency of anti-thrombin III ( ATIII) deficiency. Other clinically relevant conditions that can present with heparin resistance are congenital deficiencies; use of high doses of heparin during extracorporeal circulation , use of asparaginase therapy and disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC). Most of these conditions effect the ATIII levels. Patients are typically identified in an acute phase , when determination of the cause of resistance is challenging. We present a case where a patient presented with suspected heparin resistance in an acute phase of sickness , where timely intervention was able to prevent a potentially fatal situation.
