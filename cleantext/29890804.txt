  To investigate the efficacy and complications of manual reduction and external fixation for the treatment of scaphoid fractures and perilunate dislocations. From January 2009 to January 2013 , 43 patients suffered from scaphoid fractures and perilunate dislocations were retrospective analyzed. Among them , 17 cases were treated with manipulative reduction and plaster external fixation as conservation group including 10 males and 7 females , the other 26 cases were treated with application of surgical as operation group including 15 males and 11 females. The clinical effects were assessed by Cooney function score , radiological analysis and observation of complications. All patients were followed up for ( 45.00 ± 8.72) months ranging from 36 to 60 months. At the final follow-up , the Cooney score of wrist function was 88.53 ± 4.24 in conservation group and 89.58 ± 4.59 in operation group ( For patients suffered from the scaphoid fractures and perilunate dislocation , the early manipulative reduction and plaster external fixation after injury as soon as possible is necessary. Maintaining a satisfactory reduction and reliable fixation at the same time can lead to good treatment effect and there 's no weakness<symptom> compared to surgical treatment. But there was an increase in danger of complications. The key of conservative treatment lies in early diagnosis and maintenance of reduction , reliable fixation , and timely and appropriate functional exercise.
