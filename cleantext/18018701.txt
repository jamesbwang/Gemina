  Post-operative microwave ( MW) hyperthermia<symptom> has been applied as an important adjuvant therapy to enhance the efficacy of traditional cancer treatment. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of MW hyperthermia<symptom> may provide guided and further information on clinical hyperthermia<symptom> treatment. In this study , we examined the effects of MW hyperthermia<symptom> on non‑small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC) cells in vitro , as well as the underlying mechanisms. In order to mimic clinical treatment , we developed special MW heating equipment for this study. Various NSCLC cells ( H460 , PC-9 and H1975) were exposed to hyperthermia<symptom> treatment using a water bath or MW heating system. The results revealed that MW hyperthermia<symptom> significantly inhibited cell growth compared with the water bath heating system. Furthermore , MW hyperthermia<symptom> increased the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , decreased the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP) and induced caspase‑3 dependent apoptosis. It also induced G2/M phase arrest through the upregulation of the expression of phosphorylated ( p) ataxia<symptom> telangiectasia mutated ( ATM) , p‑checkpoint kinase 2 ( Chk2) and p21 , and the downregulation of the expression of cdc25c , cyclin B1 and cdc2. On the whole , the findings of this study indicate that the exposure of NSCLC cells to MW hyperthermia<symptom> promotes caspase‑3 dependent apoptosis and induces G2/M cell cycle arrest via the ATM pathway. This preclinical study may help to provide laboratory-based evidence for MW hyperthermia<symptom> treatment in clinical practice.
