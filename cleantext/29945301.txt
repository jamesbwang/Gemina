  The Harmonizing Outcome Measures for Eczema<disease> ( HOME) recommended the Eczema<disease> Area and Severity Index ( EASI) as the core outcome instrument for measuring the clinical signs of atopic dermatitis<disease> ( AD). However , EASI may not have been used in previous clinical trials , and other scores , e.g. SCORAD ( SCORing Atopic Dermatitis<disease>) , the objective component of SCORAD ( oSCORAD) and the Investigator Global Assessment ( IGA) , remain widely used. It is useful to establish a method to convert these scores into EASI to compare the results from different studies effectively. Indeed , EASI and oSCORAD have been found to be strongly correlated ( r
