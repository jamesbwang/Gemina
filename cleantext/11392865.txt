  Research in the field of work and organizational psychology increasingly highlights the importance of meaningful work. Adding to this growing body of research , this study examined the complex linkage between meaningful work and performance. More specifically , we hypothesized that meaningful work has a positive relationship with an employee 's performance in several and interrelated ways , via employees ' use of strengths , via work engagement , and via strengths use affecting work engagement. We conducted a structural equation modeling on a sample of 459 professionals working at a global operating organization for health technology. The results provided support for the proposed model which showed a better fit than the sequential mediation model and the direct effects model. This indicates that the meaningful work-performance relationship is predicted best by multiple pathways via employees ' use of strengths and work engagement. The main theoretical , practical , and methodological implications of the results are discussed.
