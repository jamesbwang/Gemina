  Without a true criterion standard assessment , the sport-related concussion ( SRC) diagnosis remains subjective. Inertial balance<symptom> sensors have been proposed to improve acute SRC assessment , but few researchers have studied their clinical utility. To determine if group differences exist when using objective measures of balance<symptom> in a sample of collegiate athletes with recent SRCs and participants serving as the control group and to calculate sensitivity and specificity to determine the diagnostic utility of the inertial balance<symptom> sensor for acute SRC injuries. Cross-sectional cohort study. Multicenter clinical trial. We enrolled 48 participants with SRC ( age = 20.62 ± 1.52 years , height = 179.76 ± 10.00 cm , mass = 83.92 ± 23.22 kg) and 45 control participants ( age = 20.85 ± 1.42 years , height = 177.02 ± 9.59 cm , mass = 74.61 ± 14.92 kg) at 7 clinical sites in the United States. All were varsity or club collegiate athletes , and all participants with SRC were tested within 72 hours of SRC. Balance<symptom> performance was assessed using an inertial balance<symptom> sensor. Two measures ( root mean square sway and 95 % ellipse sway area) were analyzed to represent a range of general balance<symptom> measures. Balance<symptom> assessments were conducted in double-legged , single-legged , and tandem stances. A main effect for group was associated with the root mean square sway measure ( F Inertial balance<symptom> sensors may be useful tools for objectively measuring balance<symptom> during acute SRC evaluation. However , low sensitivity suggests that they may be best used in conjunction with other assessments to form a comprehensive screening that may improve sensitivity.
