  Nesfatin-1 is a naturally occurring 82-amino acid protein encoded in the precursor nucleobindin-2 ( NUCB2) and has been implicated in multiple physiological functions , including food intake and blood glucose regulation. This study aimed to characterize nesfatin-1 in domestic species , especially cats ( Felis<pathogen> catus) , dogs ( Canis<pathogen> lupus familiaris) , and pigs ( Sus scrofa). Our in silico analysis demonstrated that the NUCB2/nesfatin -1 amino acid sequence , especially the bioactive core region of the peptide , is very highly conserved ( more than 90 % identity) in domestic animals. Expression of mRNAs encoding NUCB2/nesfatin -1 was detected in the cat , dog , and pig stomach and pancreas. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of nesfatin-1 in the gastric mucosa of the stomach of dogs , cats , and pigs , and in the pancreatic islet Î²-cells of dogs and pigs. No nesfatin-1 immunoreactivity was found in the cat pancreas. Nesfatin-1 was detected in the serum of dog , cat , pig , bison , cow , horse , sheep , and chicken. Circulating nesfatin-1 in male and female dogs remained unchanged at 60 min after glucose administration , suggesting a lack of meal responsiveness in nesfatin-1 secretion in this species. The presence of nesfatin-1 in the gastric and endocrine pancreatic tissues suggests possible roles for this peptide in the metabolism of domestic animals. Future research should focus on elucidating the species-specific functions and mechanisms of action of nesfatin-1 in health and disease of domestic animals.
