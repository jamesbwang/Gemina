  Limited accessibility to and affordability of hearing health care ( HHC) and hearing aids ( HAs) are two reasons why people do not seek treatment for their hearing losses. This article is the first in a series of two and discusses affordability issues ( i.e. , billing models , cost-effectiveness , insurance coverage , and reimbursement) related to and provides a historical context for the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2017. This piece of legislation supports development of a new class of over-the-counter HAs that represents a disruptive technology that may transform the HHC industry by reducing costs specific to the device. A discussion of ethical issues and the importance of using evidence-based practice guidelines set the stage for the second article in this series , which reviews relevant research on issues pertaining to persons with mild hearing loss.
