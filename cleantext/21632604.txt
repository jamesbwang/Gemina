  The large size and high complexity of biological data can represent a major methodological challenge for the analysis and exchange of data sets between computers and applications. There has also been a substantial increase in the amount of metadata associated with biological data sets , which is being increasingly incorporated into existing data formats. Despite the existence of structured formats based on XML , biological data sets are mainly formatted using unstructured file formats , and the incorporation of metadata results in increasingly complex parsing routines such that they become more error prone. To overcome these problems , we present the `` biological object notation '' ( BON) format , a new way to exchange and parse nearly all biological data sets more efficiently and with less error than other currently available formats. Based on JavaScript Object Notation ( JSON) , BON simplifies parsing by clearly separating the biological data from its metadata and reduces complexity compared to XML based formats. The ability to selectively compress data up to 87 % compared to other file formats and the reduced complexity results in improved transfer times and less error prone applications.
