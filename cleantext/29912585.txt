  The Conley Scale ( CS) is a widely used tool for assessing the risk of falling for inpatients. The purpose of this study was to assess its unidimensionality , internal construct validity , targeting and reliability using Confirmatory Factor Analysis ( CFA) and Rasch analysis ( RA). The CS was administrated to a sample of 58,370 subjects admitted to a general hospital. The CFA supported the unidimensionality of the CS ( Root Mean Square Error of Approximation ( RMSEA) = 0.040) only after adjusting for local dependency between two items. The scale did not fit the Rasch model ( Ï‡ The results of this study suggested that the CS , although unidimensional , could not provide interval-scale measurement of the risk of falling , had a measurement range that mismatched the ability range of the population being measured , and had a reliability inadequate for individual person measurements. Given these findings , the use of the CS to identify inpatients at risk of falling is not recommended. Implications for rehabilitation The Conley Scale is a unidimensional tool according to Confirmatory Factor Analysis. However , Rasch analysis demonstrated that the tool could not provide interval-scale measurement of the risk of falling , had a measurement range that did not fit the ability range of the population being measured , and had a level of reliability which was inadequate for its intended purpose , that is individual person measurement. The diagnostic utility of the known published cutoff is severely hampered by the severe mistargeting and reduced reliability of the tool. Given these shortcomings , the Conley Scale can not be recommended to identify inpatients at risk of falling.
