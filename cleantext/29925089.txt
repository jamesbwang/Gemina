  To ensure that the contribution of patients and consumers in health research is better understood , respected and fully utilised. Type of program or service: Consumer representative networks that form part of a broader quality improvement program in local health services. Consultations were held with members of health consumer networks in Sydney , Northern Sydney and Western Sydney Local Health Districts , and the Sydney Children 's Hospitals Network ( at Westmead) about how to better involve consumers in health research. Feedback from 20 volunteers suggested that consumer involvement in research would be improved if: consumers understood more about research; communications clearly explained the research , why it was relevant to consumers and what might be involved; consumers ' contributions were heard and respected; and being involved in research was made an easy and positive experience. People want to be involved in health research , and have valuable contributions to make. We must ensure that the potential contribution of patients and consumers is fully utilised , and get a great deal better at communicating benefits and risks.
