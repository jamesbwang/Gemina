  Genome-wide association studies ( GWASs) have implicated many human genomic loci in the development of complex traits. The loci identified by these studies are potentially involved in novel pathways that contribute to disease pathophysiology. However , eventual therapeutic targeting of these pathways relies on bridging the gap between genetic association and function , a task that first requires validation of causal genetic variants , casual genes , and directionality of effect. Executing this task requires basic knowledge of interpreting GWAS results and prioritizing candidates for further study , in addition to understanding the experimental methods available for evaluating candidate variants. Here we review the basic genetic principles of genome-wide association studies , the computational and experimental tools used for identifying causal variants and genes , and salient illustrative examples of how cardiovascular loci have undergone functional investigation.
