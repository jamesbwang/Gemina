  Silica-based micro- , meso- , macro-porous materials offer attractive routes for designing single-site photocatalysts , supporting semiconducting nanoparticles , anchoring light-responsive metal complexes , and encapsulating metal nanoparticles to drive photochemical reactions by taking advantage of their large surface area , controllable pore channels , remarkable transparency to UV/vis and tailorable physicochemical surface characteristics. This review mainly focuses on the fascinating photocatalytic properties of silica-supported Ti catalysts from single-site catalysts to nanoparticles , their surface-chemistry engineering , such as the hydrophobic modification and synthesis of thin films , and the fabrication of nanocatalysts including morphology controlled plasmonic nanostructures with localized surface plasmon resonance. The hybridization of visible-light responsive metal complexes with porous materials for the construction of functional inorganic-organic supramolecular photocatalysts is also included. In addition , the latest progress in the application of MOFs as excellent hosts for designing photocatalytic systems is described.
