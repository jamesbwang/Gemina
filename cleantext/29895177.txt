  This study aims to review the pooled prevalence of anxiety<symptom> disorders among empty-nest elderly in China. Nine studies and 4245 empty-nest elders in China were included in this meta-analysis. A combined effect size with 95 percent confidence intervals was calculated to indicate the magnitude of the effect. The results indicated that the pooled prevalence of anxiety<symptom> disorders among empty-nest elderly in China was 41.0 % ( 95 % confidence interval: 26 % -56 %). In addition , the different regions in China show different prevalence of anxiety<symptom>. We speculated that the prevalence varies based on the different methods performed in the empty-nest elderly.
