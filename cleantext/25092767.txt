  Paneth cells are post-mitotic intestinal epithelial cells supporting the stem cell niche and mucosal immunity. Paneth cell pathologies are observed in various gastrointestinal diseases , but their plasticity and response to genomic and environmental challenges remain unclear. Using a knockin allele engineered at the mouse Lyz1 locus , we performed detailed Paneth cell-lineage tracing. Irradiation induced a subset of Paneth cells to proliferate and differentiate into villus epithelial cells. RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq) revealed that Paneth cells sorted from irradiated mice acquired a stem cell-like transcriptome; when cultured in vitro , these individual Paneth cells formed organoids. Irradiation activated Notch signaling , and forced expression of Notch intracellular domain ( NICD) in Paneth cells , but not Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway activation , induced their dedifferentiation. This study documents Paneth cell plasticity , particularly their ability to participate in epithelial replenishment following stem cell loss , adding to a growing body of knowledge detailing the molecular pathways controlling injury-induced regeneration.
