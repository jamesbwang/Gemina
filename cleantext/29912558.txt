  An approach for modeling electron transfer in solids and at surfaces of iron- ( oxyhydr) oxides and other redox active solids has been developed for electronic structure methods ( i.e. , plane-wave density functional theory) capable of performing calculations with periodic cells and large system sizes efficiently while at the same time being accurate enough to be used in the estimation of the electron-transfer coupling matrix element , V
