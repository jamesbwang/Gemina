  Our aim is to demonstrate that a healthy diet might reduce the relation between adiposity and inflammation<symptom> , whereas an unhealthy diet may increase the effect of adiposity on inflammatory biomarkers. In 618 adolescents ( 13-17 years) of the European HELENA study , data were available on body composition , a set of inflammation<symptom> markers , and food intake determined by a self-administered computerized 24-h recall. A 9-point Mediterranean diet score and an antioxidant-rich diet score were used as dietary parameters and tested as moderator. Total body fat was represented by the sum of six skinfold thicknesses and central adiposity by waist circumference. A set of inflammation-related biomarkers was used as outcome: a pro/anti-inflammatory interleukins ratio , TGFβ-1 , C-reactive protein , TNF-α , 3 cell adhesion molecules , and 3 types of immune cells; gamma-glutamyltransferase ( GGT) and homocysteine were used as cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers , and alanine transaminase ( ALT) as liver dysfunction biomarker. Multiple linear regression analyses tested moderation by diet in the adiposity-inflammation association and were adjusted for age , sex , country , puberty , socioeconomic status. Both the Mediterranean and antioxidant-rich diet , and overall and central adiposity , were important in the moderation. Diet was a significant protective moderator in the effect of adiposity on the pro/anti-inflammatory interleukins ratio , TGFβ-1 , GGT , and ALT. In conclusion , in some cases , a diet rich in antioxidants and essential nutrients may attenuate the concentration of inflammatory biomarkers caused by adiposity , whereas a poor diet appears to contribute to the onset of early oxidative stress signs.
