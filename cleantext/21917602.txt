  Hereditary enamel defect diseases are regrouped under the name `` Amelogenesis Imperfecta '' ( AIH). Both dentitions are affected. Clinical expression is heterogeneous and varies between patients. Mutations responsible for this multigene disease may alter various genes and the inheritance can be either autosomal dominant or recessive , or X-linked. Until now , no therapeutic consensus has emerged for this rare disease. The purpose of this article was to report treatments of AIH patients from childhood to early adulthood. Treatment of three patients of 3 , 8 16 years old are described. Each therapeutic option was discussed according to patients ' age and type of enamel alteration. Paediatric crowns and resin based bonding must be preferred in primary teeth. In permanent teeth , non-invasive or minimally invasive dentistry should be the first choice in order to follow a therapeutic gradient from the less invasive options to prosthodontic treatments. Functional and aesthetic issues require patients to be treated; this clinical care should be provided as early as possible to enable a harmonious growth of the maxillofacial complex and to prevent pain.
