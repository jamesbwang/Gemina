  This study aims at determining how the boron signal of the Seine River evolved in terms of concentration and isotopic signatures over eighteen years ( 1994-95 and 2006-12) and if boron isotopes can reliably trace anthropogenic inputs over time. In the anthropised Seine River watershed , boron is widely released by human activities , and even if boron concentrations ( ( B)) are below the potability limit , our study confirms the potential of boron isotopes ( Î´
