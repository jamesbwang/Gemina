  Dermoscopy revealed to be extremely useful in the diagnosis of early melanoma , the most important limitation being its subjectivity in giving a final diagnosis. To overcome this problem , several algorithms and checklists have been proposed. However , they generally demonstrated modest level of diagnostic accuracy , unsatisfactory concordance between dermoscopists and/or poor specificity. To test a new methodological approach for the differentiation between early melanoma and atypical nevi , based on an integrated clinical-anamnestic dermoscopic risk scoring system ( iDScore). We selected a total of 435 standardized dermoscopic images of clinically atypical melanocytic skin<symptom> lesion<symptom> ( MSL) excised in the suspect of malignancy ( i.e. 134 early melanomas- MM- and 301 atypical nevi). Data concerning patient age and sex and lesion<symptom> dimension and site were collected. A scoring classifier was designed based on this data set integrated with the dermoscopic evaluations performed by three experts blinded to histological diagnosis. A total of seven dermoscopic structures , three age groups ( 30-40 years , 41-60 years and > 60 years) , two maximum diameter categories ( 5-10 mm and > 10 mm) and three body areas ( i.e. frequently , chronically and seldom photoexposed sites) were selected by the scoring classifier as interdependently significant variables. The total risk score ( S) of a lesion<symptom> resulted from the simple sum of partial scores assigned to each selected variable. The iDScore-aided diagnosis showed an high accuracy ( receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve = 0.903; IC: 95 % = 0.887-0.918). A risk-based criticality scale corresponding to different S ranges was proposed. The iDScore checklist is proposed as a feasible and efficient tool to support dermatologists in non-invasive differentiation between atypical nevi and early MM on the basis of few selected clinical-anamnestic data and standardized dermoscopic features.
