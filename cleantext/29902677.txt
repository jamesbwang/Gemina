  Modified phosphogypsum ( MPG) was developed to improve dewaterability of sewage sludge , and dewatering performance , properties of treated sludge , composition and morphology distribution of EPS , dynamic analysis and multiple regression model on bound water release were investigated. The results showed that addition of MPG caused extracellular polymeric substances ( EPS) disintegration through charge neutralization. Destruction of EPS promoted the formation of larger sludge flocs and the release of bound water into supernatant. Simultaneously , content of organics with molecular weight between 1000 and 7000 Da in soluble EPS ( SB-EPS) increased with increasing of EPS dissolved into the liquid phase. Besides , about 8.8 kg â€¢ kg
