  Starch films incorporated with tea polyphenol ( TP) were developed to produce active food packaging. The effect of the incorporation of TP with different content on the structure , physicochemical properties , antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity of the starch films was systematically evaluated. Results showed that TP was well dispersed in the starch matrix , which induced a slight influence on the surface and barrier properties of the films. TP addition led to an important improvement in antioxidant capability , as well as inhibition efficiency against the microorganisms of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. However , a decrease in mechanical properties of films was observed. Moreover , a new automatic counting method which combined the computer vision and machine learning algorithm was developed to identify and count the colonies , and the method performed much faster without subjective uncertainty.
