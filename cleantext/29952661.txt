  Preeclampsia ( PE) is a multisystem syndrome<disease> that is a primary source of fetal-maternal morbidity and mortality. Human leukocyte antigen-G ( HLA-G) is a nonclassical Major histocompatibility complex ( MHC) class-Ib molecule expressed on the extravillous trophoblast and seems to have immunomodulatory functions during pregnancy. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether HLA-G may be a vital marker in the modulation of the pregnancy. In this case-control study , a number of 150 healthy pregnant women and 150 patients with PE had been genotyped for the 14 base-pair ( bp) insertion/deletion polymorphism in exon 8 of the HLA-G gene , and the serum level of soluble HLA-G ( sHLA-G) protein was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data showed that the PE syndrome<disease> was not related to the HLA-G 14 bp genotype. But , the serum level of sHLA-G in PE patients was significantly lower than that in healthy pregnant women in the third trimester ( 11.74 and 24.48 U/ml , respectively , p < 0.001). However , no significant association was observed between the HLA-G 14 bp genotype and serum sHLA-G level. Our results demonstrate that measurement of sHLA-G protein level may be helpful as a primary diagnosis for the pathogenesis of PE. Overall , this study suggests that the association between HLA-G 14 bp polymorphism and serum sHLA-G level in different ethnic populations of PE should be taken into consideration.
