  Proton therapy for the treatment of breast cancer is acquiring increasing interest , due to the potential reduction of radiation-induced side effects such as cardiac and pulmonary toxicity. While several in silico studies demonstrated the gain in plan quality offered by pencil beam scanning ( PBS) compared to passive scattering techniques , the related dosimetric uncertainties have been poorly investigated so far. Five breast cancer patients were planned with Raystation 6 analytical pencil beam ( APB) and Monte Carlo ( MC) dose calculation algorithms. Plans were optimized with APB and then MC was used to recalculate dose distribution. Movable snout and beam splitting techniques ( i.e. using two sub-fields for the same beam entrance , one with and the other without the use of a range shifter) were considered. PTV dose statistics were recorded. The same planning configurations were adopted for the experimental benchmark. Dose distributions were measured with a 2D array of ionization chambers and compared to APB and MC calculated ones by means of a Î³ analysis ( agreement criteria 3 % , 3 mm). Our results indicate that , when using proton PBS for breast cancer treatment , the Raystation 6 APB algorithm does not allow obtaining sufficient accuracy , especially with large air gaps. On the contrary , the MC algorithm resulted into much higher accuracy in all beam configurations tested and has to be recommended. Centers where a MC algorithm is not yet available should consider a careful use of APB , possibly combined with a movable snout system or in any case with strategies aimed at minimizing air gaps.
