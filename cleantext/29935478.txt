  A simple micellar electrokinetic chromatography ( MEKC) , using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ( CTAB) as micelles , for the determination of ciprofloxacin ( CIP) , enrofloxacin ( ENR) , norfloxacin ( NOR) and ofloxacin ( OFL) residues in surface water was developed. Peak Master was used for predicting amounts of analyte ionic forms to reduce numbers of tedious experiments in optimizing the analyte capacity factors. A baseline separation ( R
