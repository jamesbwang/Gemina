  Polycystic ovary syndrome<disease> ( PCOS) , a familial aggregation disease that causes anovulation in women , has well-recognised characteristics , two of which are hyperinsulinaemia and hyperandrogenaemia. To determine whether the DNA methylation status is altered in oocytes by high insulin and androgen levels , we generated a mouse model with hyperinsulinaemia and hyperandrogenaemia by injection of insulin and human chorionic gonadotrophin and investigated DNA methylation changes through single-cell level whole genome bisulphite sequencing. Our results showed that hyperinsulinaemia and hyperandrogenaemia had no significant effects on the global DNA methylation profile and different functional regions of genes , but did alter methylation status of some genes , which were significantly enriched in 17 gene ontology ( GO) terms ( P < 0.05) by GO analysis. Among differently methylated genes , some were related to the occurrence of PCOS. Based on our results , we suggest that hyperinsulinaemia and hyperandrogenaemia may cause changes in some DNA methylation loci in oocytes.
