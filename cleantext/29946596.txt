  Delivering molecules onto the plasma membrane of single cells is still a challenging task in profiling cell signaling pathways with single cell resolution. We demonstrated that a large quantity of molecules could be targeted and released onto the membrane of individual cells to trigger signaling responses. This is achieved by a porous pen nanodeposition ( PPN) method , in which a multilayer porous structure , serving as a reservoir for a large amount of molecules , is formed on an atomic force microscope ( AFM) tip using layer-by-layer assembly and post processing. To demonstrate its capability for single cell membrane drug delivery , PPN was employed to induce a calcium flux triggered by the binding of released antibodies to membrane antigens in an autoimmune skin disease model. This calcium signal propagates from the target cell to its neighbors in a matter of seconds , proving the theory of intercellular communication through cell-cell junctions. Collectively , these results demonstrated the effectiveness of PPN in membrane drug delivery for single cells; to the best of our knowledge , this is the first technique that can perform the targeted transport and delivery in single cell resolution , paving the way for probing complex signaling interactions in multicellular settings.
