  Insect metamorphosis involves a complex change in form and function. In this study , we examined the development of the solitary bee , Megachile rotundata , using micro-computed tomography ( Î¼CT) and volume analysis. We describe volumetric changes of brain , tracheae , flight muscles , gut , and fat bodies in prepupal , pupal , and adult M. rotundata. We observed that individual organ systems have distinct patterns of developmental progression , which vary in their timing and duration. This has important implications for commercial management of this agriculturally relevant pollinator.
