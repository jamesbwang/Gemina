  In this study , the appearance and texture of E. rutaecarpa were linked with the chemical constituents to explore methods of classification of E. rutaecarpa. The Chemometrics such as Hierarchical cluster analysis ( HCA) , principal component analysis ( PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis ( PLS-DA) models were used for analysis. According to the models , samples of E. rutaecarpa were divided into three categories based on their source: Evodia , Stone Tiger and Sparse Evodia. The Evodia category could be subdivided into two categories , one representing large fruits with a greater degree of cracking and the other representing large fruits with little or no cracking. The method provided by this study combines chemometrics with HPLC fingerprints , which can provide a basis and reference for the identification of E. rutaecarpa and enables establishment of a grade standard.
