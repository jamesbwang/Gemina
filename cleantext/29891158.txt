  A propagation of microinvasive glaucoma surgery ( MIGS) techniques and devices has resulted in the availability of multiple new modalities for surgical intervention for open-angle glaucoma. As MIGS devices and methods approach a new phase in maturity , midterm failures will inevitably be reported. Although MIGS techniques prioritize safety , an understanding of the potential mechanisms of failure is paramount. In this case of a midterm failure of a trabecular microbypass , clinical findings and pathological correlates allow for a comprehensive understanding of the means by which MIGS devices might fail and offer the opportunity for intervention and potential prevention.
