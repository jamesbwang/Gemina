  Video and hobby gaming are immensely popular among adults; however , associations between gaming and health have primarily been investigated in children and adolescents. Furthermore , most research has focused on electronic gaming , despite traditional hobby gaming gaining prominence. To determine whether the number of platforms used , platform preference , and gaming time are associated with obesity , physical activity , sedentary behavior , and cardiovascular risk factors in an adult gaming population. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data obtained from 292 participants who attended a large Midwestern gaming convention. We collected data using a computer-based questionnaire that comprised questions on gaming behavior , demographics , physical activity ( using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire) , and health characteristics. In addition , we used multivariable-adjusted linear and logistic regression to model health outcomes as a function of the number of platforms used , platform preference , and weekday and weekend gaming time quartile. After adjusting for covariates , we observed a significant linear trend for increasing odds of being obese and higher weekend sitting time by the number of platforms used ( P = .03 for both). The platform preference and weekend gaming time quartile exhibited significant associations with odds of meeting physical activity recommendations ( P = .047 and P = .03 , respectively). In addition , we observed higher odds of being obese among those reporting that they sat most or all of the time while gaming ( odds ratio ( OR) 2.69 ( 95 % CI 1.14-6.31) and OR 2.71 ( 95 % CI 1.06-6.93) , respectively). In adult gamers , the number of platforms used , which platforms they prefer to play on , and the amount of time spent gaming on weekends could have significant implications for their odds of being obese and meeting physical activity recommendations.
