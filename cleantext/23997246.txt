  Complementary Alternative Medicine ( CAM) that targets infants and children can place them at grave risk. Our plan is to review some of the major cases of CAM used by parents , and by unlicensed and even licensed health professionals. Complications from CAM are rarely the focus of regulatory bodies , or even the courts. Even regulated health professionals , who have profited by misrepresenting science-based evidence for treatment or prevention of disease , have been rarely sanctioned by their respective Boards or Colleges. This must change. In addition , there is a dire need for regulators , including the governments , who allow quack products and devices to be marketed in their respective countries , to prosecute them. Existing regulations must be coupled with more effective enforcement. Some of these cases have had a direct connection to me personally , while others are examples of just plain dangerous quackery.
