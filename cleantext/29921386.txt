  Venous leg ulcers<disease> ( VLUs) are chronic difficult-to-treat wounds<disease> which affect around 1-2 % of the world population. Conventional methods for treatment such as mechanical debridement , occlusive dressings and local antibiotics in case of infection , often lack effectiveness. Autologous platelet-rich plasma ( PRP) is an alternative method in the treatment of chronic<disease> wounds<disease>. PRP contains inflammatory mediators , growth factors , and cytokines that modulate the wound<disease> microenvironment to create a better chance for healing. The aim of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the efficacy of intralesional injection of PRP in the management of VLUs. This study included 23 patients with VLUs. For each patient , two ulcers<disease> located in the same anatomical zone and at the same clinical stage were selected. One was treated with a single application of autologous PRP. The other ulcer<disease> was used as a control and was treated by conventional methods. The size of the ulcers<disease> was assessed at baseline ( visit 0) , 15 days ( visit 1) and 30 days after the procedure ( visit 2). Results showed a significant reduction of the size of the ulcer<disease> both in the group treated with PRP ( mean surface 1368.2 mm2 at visit 0 and 596.3 mm2 at visit 2) and in the control group ( mean surface 880.3 mm2 at visit 0 and 582.8 mm2 at visit 2). Statistical analysis showed a significant change in the size of the ulcer<disease> between visit 0 and visit 2 in both groups ( p less than 0.0001). The application of PRP in difficult-to-treat venous leg ulcers<disease> may be a promising new method for therapy of this condition. The results of this study correlate with the data from the majority of previous studies and confirm the effectiveness of PRP. Nevertheless further research in the area is needed to evaluate the therapeutic significance of the method and eventually show its superiority to conventional treatments in larger cohorts.
