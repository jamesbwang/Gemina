  Bacteria have the ability to adapt to changing environments through rapid evolution mediated by modification of existing genetic information , as well as by horizontal gene transfer ( HGT). This makes bacteria a highly successful life form when it comes to survival. Unfortunately , this genetic plasticity may result in emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes , and even the creation of multiresistant `` superbugs '' which may pose serious threats to public health. As bacteria commonly reside in biofilms , there has been an increased interest in studying these phenomena within biofilms in recent years. This review summarizes the present knowledge within this important area of research. Studies on bacterial evolution in biofilms have shown that mature biofilms develop into diverse communities over time. There is growing evidence that the biofilm lifestyle may be more mutagenic than planktonic growth. Furthermore , all three main mechanisms for HGT have been observed in biofilms. This has been shown to occur both within and between bacterial species , and higher transfer rates in biofilms than in planktonic cultures were detected. Of special concern are the observations that mutants with increased antibiotic resistance occur at higher frequency in biofilms than in planktonic cultures even in the absence of antibiotic exposure. Likewise , efficient dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes , as well as virulence genes , has been observed within the biofilm environment. This new knowledge emphasizes the importance of biofilm awareness and control.
