  The motor system 's ability to adapt to environmental changes is essential for maintaining accurate movements. Such adaptation recruits several distinct systems: cerebellar sensory-prediction error learning , success-based reinforcement , and explicit control. Although much work has focused on the relationship between cerebellar learning and explicit control , there is little research regarding how reinforcement and explicit control interact. To address this , participants first learnt a 20 Â° visuomotor displacement. After reaching asymptotic performance , binary , hit-or-miss feedback ( BF) was introduced either with or without visual feedback , the latter promoting reinforcement. Subsequently , retention was assessed using no-feedback trials , with half of the participants in each group being instructed to stop aiming off target. Although BF led to an increase in retention of the visuomotor displacement , instructing participants to stop re-aiming nullified this effect , suggesting explicit control is critical to BF-based reinforcement. In a second experiment , we prevented the expression or development of explicit control during BF performance , by either constraining participants to a short preparation time ( expression) or by introducing the displacement gradually ( development). Both manipulations strongly impaired BF performance , suggesting reinforcement requires both recruitment and expression of an explicit component. These results emphasise the pivotal role explicit control plays in reinforcement-based motor learning.
