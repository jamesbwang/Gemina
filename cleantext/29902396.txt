  To examine the compliance of colorectal cancer surveillance decisions for individuals at greater risk with current evidence-based guidelines and to determine whether compliance differs between surveillance models. Prospective auditing of compliance of surveillance decisions with evidence-based guidelines ( NHMRC) in two decision-making models: nurse coordinator-led decision making in public academic hospitals and physician-led decision making in private non-academic hospitals. Selected South Australian hospitals participating in the Southern Co-operative Program for the Prevention of Colorectal Cancer ( SCOOP). Proportions of recall recommendations that matched NHMRC guideline recommendations ( March-May 2015); numbers of surveillance colonoscopies undertaken more than 6 months ahead of schedule ( January-December 2015); proportions of significant neoplasia findings during the 15 years of SCOOP operation ( 2000-2015). For the nurse-led/public academic hospital model , the recall interval recommendation following 398 of 410 colonoscopies ( 97 %) with findings covered by NHMRC guidelines corresponded to the guideline recommendations; for the physician-led/private non-academic hospital model , this applied to 257 of 310 colonoscopies ( 83 %) ( P < 0.001). During 2015 , 27 % of colonoscopies in public academic hospitals ( mean , 27 months; SD , 13 months) and 20 % of those in private non-academic hospitals ( mean , 23 months; SD , 12 months) were performed more than 6 months earlier than scheduled , in most cases because of patient-related factors ( symptoms , faecal occult blood test results). The ratio of the numbers of high risk adenomas to cancers increased from 6.6:1 during 2001-2005 to 16:1 during 2011-2015. The nurse-led/public academic hospital model for decisions about colorectal cancer surveillance intervals achieves a high degree of compliance with guideline recommendations , which should relieve burdening of colonoscopy resources.
