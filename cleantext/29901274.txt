  Peroxisomal proliferation is highly stimulated during the biosynthesis of mycotoxins and plant infection by Fusarium<pathogen> graminearum. Currently , the functions of the peroxisome in these cellular processes are poorly understood. In this study , we applied genetic , cell biological and biochemical analyses to investigate the functions of the peroxisomes. We constructed targeted deletion of docking machinery components , including FgPex13 , FgPex14 and the filamentous fungal specific peroxin FgPex33. Our results indicated that peroxisome dysfunction resulted in a shortage of acetyl-CoA , the precursor of trichothecene biosynthesis , and subsequently decreased deoxynivalenol ( DON) production. Deletion mutants of ΔFgPex13 , ΔFgPex14 or ΔFgPex33 showed an increased accumulation of endogenous reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and reduced phosphorylation of MAP ( Mitogen-Activated Protein) kinase FgMgv1. In addition , mutants of the docking peroxin exhibited increased sensitivity toward host oxidative bursts and cell wall integrity stress agents and reduced virulence on host plants. More importantly , we found for the first time that FgPex14 is required for pexophagy in F. graminearum. Overall , our study suggests that peroxisomes play critical roles in DON biosynthesis and virulence in F. graminearum. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
