  Bilateral deep brain stimulation of subthalamic nucleus ( STN-DBS) has proven effective in improving motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom> in Parkinson 's disease ( PD) patients. However , psychiatric changes after surgery are controversial. In this study , we specifically analyzed apathy following bilateral STN-DBS in PD patients using a meta-analysis. Relevant articles utilized for this study were obtained through literature search on PubMed , ScienceDirect , and Embase databases. The articles included were those contained both pre- and postsurgery apathy data acquired using the Starkstein Apathy Scale or Apathy Evaluation Scale with patient follow-up of at least three months. A total of 9 out of 86 articles were included in our study through this strict screening process. Standardized mean difference ( SMD) , that is , Cohen 's d , with a 95 % confidence interval ( CI) was calculated to show the change. We found a significant difference between the presurgery stage and the postsurgery stage scores ( SMD = 0.35 , 95 % CI: 0.17 âˆ¼ 0.52 ,
