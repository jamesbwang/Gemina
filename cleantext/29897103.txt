  The presence of seed color in common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris<pathogen>) requires the dominant-acting P ( pigment) gene , and white seed is a recessive phenotype in all domesticated races of the species. P was classically associated with seed size , thus describing it as the first genetic marker for a quantitative trait. The molecular structure of P was characterized to understand the selection of white seeds during bean diversification and the relationship of P to seed weight. P was identified by homology searches , a genome-wide association study ( GWAS) and gene remodeling , and confirmed by gene silencing. Allelic variation was assessed by a combination of resequencing and marker development , and the relationship between P and seed weight was assessed by a GWAS study. P is a member of clade B of subclass IIIf of plant basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH) proteins. Ten race-specific P alleles conditioned the white seed phenotype , and each causative mutation affected at least one bHLH domain required for color expression. GWAS analysis confirmed the classic association of P with seed weight. In common bean , white seeds are the result of convergent evolution and , among plant species , orthologous convergence on a single transcription factor gene was observed.
