  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture in reducing opioid consumption in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. A randomized , participant-assessor-blinded , three-arm trial. Participants from three pain clinics and from the public. One hundred and eight adults with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> who were taking opioids. All participants received pain and medication management education. Participants were randomly allocated to electroacupuncture ( N = 48) , sham electroacupuncture ( N = 29) , or education alone ( N = 31) to receive relevant treatment for 12 weeks. The last group received electroacupuncture during the three-month follow-up. Analysis of covariance and paired t tested were used. Opioid dosage , that is , the primary outcome measure , was reduced by 20.5 % ( P < 0.05) and 13.7 % ( P < 0.01) in the two acupuncture groups and by 4.5 % in the education group at the end of the treatment phase , but without any group difference. Intensity of pain of all three groups did not change over time. No group differences were found in dosage of nonopioid analgesics , pain intensity , function , and opioid-related adverse events. During follow-up , the education group had a 47 % reduction of opioids after a course of electroacupuncture. Adverse events to electroacupuncture were minor. It is safe to reduce opioid medication use in patients with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Due to the small sample size , we could not confirm if electroacupuncture offers extra benefit in addition to education. This nondrug therapy could be a promising adjunct to facilitate opioid tapering in patients who are willing to reduce opioids.
