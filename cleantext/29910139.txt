  While there are various medication self-efficacy scales that exist , none assess self-efficacy for appropriate antibiotic use. The Appropriate Antibiotic Use Self-Efficacy Scale ( AAUSES) was developed , pilot tested , and its psychometric properties were examined. Following pilot testing of the scale , a 28-item questionnaire was examined using a sample ( n = 289) recruited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Participants also completed other scales and items , which were used in assessing discriminant , convergent , and criterion-related validity. Test-retest reliability was also examined. After examining the scale and removing items that did not assess appropriate antibiotic use , an exploratory factor analysis was conducted on 13 items from the original scale. Three factors were retained that explained 65.51 % of the variance. The scale and its subscales had adequate internal consistency. The scale had excellent test-retest reliability , as well as demonstrated convergent , discriminant , and criterion-related validity. The AAUSES is a valid and reliable scale that assesses three domains of appropriate antibiotic use self-efficacy. The AAUSES may have utility in clinical and research settings in understanding individuals ' beliefs about appropriate antibiotic use and related behavioral correlates. Future research is needed to examine the scale 's utility in these settings.
