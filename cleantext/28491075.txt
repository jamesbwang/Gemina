  A major stripe rust resistance QTL on chromosome 4BL was localized to a 4.5-Mb interval using comparative QTL mapping methods and validated in 276 wheat genotypes by haplotype analysis. CYMMIT-derived wheat line P10103 was previously identified to have adult plant resistance ( APR) to stripe rust in the greenhouse and field. The conventional approach for QTL mapping in common wheat is laborious. Here , we performed QTL detection of APR using a combination of genome-wide scanning and extreme pool-genotyping. SNP-based genetic maps were constructed using the Wheat55 K SNP array to genotype a recombinant inbred line ( RIL) population derived from the cross Mingxian 169 Ã— P10103. Five stable QTL were detected across multiple environments. A fter comparing SNP profiles from contrasting , extreme DNA pools of RILs six putative QTL were located to approximate chromosome positions. A major QTL on chromosome 4B was identified in F
