  The main focus of the presented work was the investigation of structure and residual stress gradients in the near-surface region of materials studied by X-ray diffraction. The multireflection method was used to measure depth-dependent stress variation in near-surface layers of a Ti sample ( grade 2) subjected to different mechanical treatments. First , the multireflection grazing incidence diffraction method was applied on a classical diffractometer with Cu
