  Studies on genetic aberrations among Indian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) patients are limited to C9orf72 and ATXN2 repeat expansions and mutations in the SOD1 gene. In this study , we used targeted next-generation sequencing to analyze 25 ALS-associated genes in a cohort of 154 Indian ALS patients. We identified known pathogenic mutations in SOD1 ( G148D; H44R) , TARDBP ( M337V; N267S) , DAO ( R199Q) , and ANG ( K41I). In addition , we also identified 7 potentially pathogenic missense variants that have not been previously reported in ALS patients; this includes 3 novel variants ( OPTN: K489E , DAO: E121K , and SETX: L2163V) that are not reported in large population databases and 4 rare variants ( CHMP2B: E45K , SQSTM1: G262R and P438L , ERBB4: R103H) with a minor allele frequency of < 0.01 in large population databases. All known pathogenic , novel , and rare variants were detected in only 1 ALS patient each with the exception of the OPTN ( K489E) variant that was detected in 2 patients in our cohort. In sum , we identified known and potentially pathogenic novel and rare mutations in 14 ( 9.1 %) ALS patients in our cohort. This study represents the first comprehensive genetic analysis in the ethnically diverse population and thus provides a new insight into the genetics of Indian ALS patients.
