  Particle conveying channels may be bundled together. The limited carrying capacity of the constituent channels may cause the bundle to be subject to blockages. If coupled , the blockage of one channel causes an increase in the flux entering the others , leading to a cascade of failures. Once all the channels are blocked , no additional particles may enter the system. If the blockages are of finite duration , the system reaches a steady state with an exiting flux that is reduced compared to the incoming one. We propose a stochastic model consisting of N
