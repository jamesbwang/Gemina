  With the advent of probe corrected STEM machines it became possible to probe specimens on a scale of less than 50 pm resolution. This opens completely new horizons for research , as it is e.g. possible to probe the electrostatic fields between individual rows of atoms , using differential phase contrast ( DPC). However , in contrast to conventional DPC , where one deals with extended fields which can be assumed constant across the electron probe , this is not possible for sub-atomic probes in DPC. For the latter case it was shown ( 1,2) , that the strongly inhomogeneous field distribution within the probe diameter , which usually is caused by the nuclear potentials of an atomic column , leads to a complicated intensity redistribution within the diffraction disk. The task is then to determine the intensity weighted centre of the diffraction disk pattern ( frequently also called centre of mass , COM) , which is proportional to the average lateral momentum gained by the average electron , transmitted through the probe diameter. In first reported measurements , the determination of this COM was achieved using a pixelated detector in combination with a software-based evaluation of the COM. This suffers from two disadvantages: first , the nowadays available pixelated detectors are still not very fast ( approximately 1000 fps) and quite expensive , and second , the amount of data to be processed after acquisition is comparatively huge. In this paper we report on an alternative to a pixelated detector , which is able to directly deliver the COM of a diffraction disk 's intensity distribution with frequencies up to 200 kHz. We present measurements on the sensitivity of this detector as well as first results from DPC imaging. From these results we expect the detector also to serve well in sub-atomic DPC field sensing , possibly replacing today 's segmented or pixelated detectors.
