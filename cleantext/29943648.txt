  This paper presents the case of a 68 years old male who was admitted to the hospital after being attacked by another person. The main clinical signs were confusion<symptom> and severe periorbital edema<symptom> , findings of gunshot injury were not evident initially. However , a CT scan showed findings compatible with an orbito-cranial perforating gunshot injury. To the best of the author 's knowledge , cases like this have not been reported in the literature. This report shows us that an orbito-cranial gunshot injury should be ruled out in cases of severe periorbital edema<symptom> , especially if the cause of the injury remains unidentified.
