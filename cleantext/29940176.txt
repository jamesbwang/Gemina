  STEAP2 is a member of the Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate ( STEAP) protein family that is proposed to function as metalloreductase. While STEAP2 shows a complex subcellular distribution pattern localizing to both secretory and endocytic pathway organelles , how such broad steady-state distribution is maintained is unknown. Similarly , whether STEAP2 undergoes any compartment-specific modulation during intracellular trafficking has not been reported. Leveraging a newly-identified monoclonal antibody that recognizes a conformation-sensitive epitope nested in the second extracellular loop of STEAP2 , we demonstrate that the epitope formation was dependent on the cholesterol content of the membrane in which STEAP2 was embedded. Monitoring the STEAP2-dependent internalization of this antibody uncovered STEAP2 's rapid internalization from the cell surface and their subsequence trafficking to the Golgi region and endosome-like puncta. Acute inhibition of endocytosis also increased the detectable amount of STEAP2 at the plasma membrane. Collectively , these experiments demonstrate that an intricate balance<symptom> of membrane flux between the secretory and endocytic pathways underlies the characteristic broad subcellular localization of STEAP2. By using a cell-based assay that detects the metalloreductase functions of cell surface-localizing STEAP4 , STEAP2 's metalloreductase activities were not detectable , suggesting that its enzymatic function is suppressed at the plasma membrane. The conformational modulation of STEAP2 by the local membrane cholesterol content can therefore serve as a potential mechanism to modulate STEAP2 function in a compartment-restricted manner , by coupling a pre-existing difference in cholesterol content among different cellular membranes<symptom> to a dynamic trafficking process leading to broad subcellular distribution.
