  To investigate the expression of miR-134 and the change of inflammatory cytokines in seizure<symptom> rats and to explore its relationship. A rat model of seizures<symptom> was made by an intraperitoneal injection with kainic acid. ELISA kit for detection of seizures<symptom> in rats was used. The changes of inflammatory cytokines ( IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-6 , TNF-α , IFN-γ) and the hippocampal neuronal cell growth were observed. The expression of miR-134 in brain tissue and serum samples of model group and control group was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) quantitative determination. After the intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid , the rat model of seizure<symptom> was successfully established. Compared with the control group , the neuronal cells in the hippocampus of the model group showed evident pathological changes. Inflammatory cytokines in seizures<symptom> rats showed that the increase of IL-2 , IL-6 , and TNF-α were larger , but the increase of IL-1 and IFN-γ was not obvious. The results of the RT-PCR quantitative analysis showed that the expression of miR-134 in brain tissue and serum of epilepsy rats was lower than that of the control group ( p < 0.05). The expression of miR-134 would be down by the increasing of inflammatory cytokines in the
