  Acute pulmonary embolism ( APE)- induced inflammation<symptom> contributes to cardiomyocyte injury and dysfunction in the right ventricle ( RV) of the heart. The interactions of cyclophilin A with its ligand extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer ( EMMPRIN or CD147) may be involved in this inflammatory process. To this end , here we induced APE by intravenous injections of microspheres in Sprague-Dawley rats. We found that after the APE , cyclophilin A , and CD147 levels increased synchronously in RV tissue following APE and peaked at 24 hours. The cyclophilin A inhibitor cyclosporine A attenuated the APE-induced cyclophilin A levels , and a monoclonal antibody of CD147 ( anti-CD147) abrogated the elevation of CD147 in the RV but not the increase of cyclophilin A. Importantly , treatment with cyclosporine A , anti-CD147 , or both attenuated APE-induced increases in RV systolic pressure , plasma cardiac troponin-I ( cTnI) concentrations , the RV/left ventricle diameter ratio , and the Tei index , measured by echocardiography 24 hours after APE induction. These beneficial effects were associated with reduced RV neutrophil infiltration and prevention of matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9) and MMP-2 activation. These findings suggested that inhibiting the cyclophilin A-CD147 interaction attenuates APE-associated RV cardiomyocyte injury and dysfunction by suppressing inflammation<symptom>. We further proposed that cyclophilin A and CD147 might participate in APE-induced pathological processes by partly activating the ERK1/2 kinase-nuclear factor-ÎºB pathway. We conclude that the cyclophilin A-CD147 interaction may represent a potential therapeutic target for managing APE.
