  Pyrroloquinoline quinone ( PQQ) is a bacterial dehydrogenase coenzyme. PQQ can promote body growth and regulate the function of free radical level of the body. It could be applied in food , medicine and other fields. Due to the extremely high cost of chemical synthesis , the production of PQQ by microbial fermentation attracted more and more attention. At present , the production titer of PQQ by fermentation method is too low to achieve industrial application. Due to the lack of a thorough understanding of the PQQ biosynthesis and its regulation mechanisms , and the lack of necessary genetic engineering modification methods for wild type strains , metabolic engineering of microorganisms to enhance PQQ production still lacks essential requirements. In this study , a PQQ-producing bacterium<pathogen> , Methylobacterium<pathogen> extorquens<pathogen> I-F2 , was employed as a model strain. By integration of Atmospheric and room temperature plasma ( ARTP) mutagenesis , flow cytometry sorting and high-throughput screening strategies , optimization of sample preparation and flow sorting process , a high-titer PQQ mutant strain was obtained. The titer of PQQ was increased by 98.02 % compared with that of M. extorqunens I-F2. The process described here showed that the combination of the flow cytometry with high-throughput screening method can be used to obtain high-titer mutants more simply and rapidly , compared with genetic engineering and traditional screening methods.
