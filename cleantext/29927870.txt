  We have established an integrated thoracic radiology reading room within a multidisciplinary lung center clinic ( LC). While our subjective experience has been positive , we sought to quantify how this model affects radiology workflow and whether the referring practitioners perceive value in having real-time access to a radiologist consultant. Two diagnostic radiology workstations staffed by rotating thoracic radiologists and trainees were integrated within the LC. We assessed the impact on workflow by recording over 6 months the number , duration , and type of face-to-face radiology consultations to LC practitioners. We also conducted an anonymous survey to assess how LC practitioners felt with regard to the utility and value of our service. Face-to-face consultations account for an average of 10 % of total time spent by radiologists in the LC , although on busy clinical days this can reach 25 % to 30 %. Our survey response rate was very high ( 86.4 % , n = 51) , with overwhelming positive response by referring practitioners , who unanimously rate the usefulness of this service as high ( 9.8 %) or extremely high ( 90.2 %). Not a single respondent had a negative or even neutral view of this service. Moreover , 90.2 % thought that radiology consultations directly add clinical value in > 60 % of episodes , whereas 86.2 % responded that these alter management in > 40 % of episodes. Face-to-face radiology consultations in an integrated LC are numerous and comprise a sizable share of radiologist workload. More importantly , the radiologist is highly praised as a consultant , and this service is considered valuable and impactful for patient care.
