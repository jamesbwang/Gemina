  The aim of the study was to assess MMP-2 ( matrix metalloproteinase-2) and TIMP-2 ( tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2) serum levels in patients with diverse types of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) and chronic kidney disease ( CKD). 101 patients with chronic HF were enrolled. Each patient has assessed the serum levels of MMP-2 , TIMP-2 , and NT-proBNP. Patients were initially classified into 2 groups based on their LVEF. 43 patients were classified into the HFREF group ( HF with Reduced Ejection Fraction) and 58 characterized as HFPEF ( HF with Preserved Ejection Fraction). Next , all patients were subdivided into 4 groups according to the degree of diastolic dysfunction. 38 patients with CKD were classified into HF/CKD ( +) group. The HF/CKD (-) ( HF without CKD) group comprised 61 patients. This study provides original data on positive correlation between ejection fraction and MMP-2 levels in all patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Elevated levels of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 were found in serum from patients with chronic kidney disease; in addition , serum levels of MMP-2 were correlated with the degree of kidney failure. In all groups of patients there was positive correlation between MMP-2 and TIMP-2. Among patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> etiology was not related to MMP-2 and TIMP-2 serum levels.
