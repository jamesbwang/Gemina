  To evaluate associations between voice and working postures<symptom> used during teaching. A researcher assessed 30 teachers ' typical working postures<symptom> of the torso , head , shoulders , upper back , and arms by observing and/or asking questions about them. Teachers ' options to rest and to adjust furniture according to their needs were also elicited. Voice symptoms were evaluated through 2 self-assessment forms. Fundamental frequency , sound pressure level ( SPL) , and alpha ratio were calculated from voice samples recorded before , during , and after teaching. The head was most typically in an unergonomic posture<symptom> while speaking ( in 60 % of participants). Other frequently used unergonomic postures<symptom> were hunched upper back ( 55 %) , raised shoulders ( 46 %) , and twisted torso ( 43 %). Head and torso twisted and arms upheld were associated with specific voice symptoms and head postures<symptom> and hunched upper back with voice use. The number of postures<symptom> was also connected with voice use: if the teachers used over 3 unergonomic postures<symptom> , their SPL was higher and the voice broke more often than in those with a lower number of postures<symptom>. Unergonomic postures<symptom> during speaking affect the voice. It is important to evaluate working postures<symptom> as part of voice ergonomic assessment in voice patients.
