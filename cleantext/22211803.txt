  This study aimed to assess the cytotoxic , genotoxic , and mutagenic potentials of water samples collected in the Alegre River Basin , located in a predominantly rural area with no sewage treatment facilities in the Esp√≠rito Santo State , Brazil , using Allium cepa test. Also , gills and liver of Rhamdia quelen , a common fish species of the region , were histologically analyzed. A semi-quantitative analysis was performed and a histopathological alterations index ( HAI) was determined. Our findings indicated that the waters of this river basin were cytotoxic ( mitotic index reduction) and/or genotoxic ( chromosomal abnormalities induction). Mutagenicity ( micronuclei induction) was not observed for any water sample. The values for HAI showed that the waters caused moderate histological alterations in R. quelen. Liver was more sensitive than gills. It is necessary to implement a sewage treatment system and raise awareness on inappropriate management and disposal of agrochemicals in order to allow the recovery of Alegre River.
