  While previous literature suggests home parenteral nutrition ( HPN) dependent children experience frequent complications like community acquired central line associated bloodstream infections ( CLABSI) , few studies have characterized the cost. To evaluate institutional cost of community-acquired CLABSI in pediatric HPN patients. This is a single center retrospective review of institutional costs for HPN patients with community-acquired CLABSI at a tertiary care children 's hospital. Inclusions<disease> were age â‰¤ 18 years-old between October 2011 to April 2016. Exclusions were death during hospitalization , readmission within 2 days of discharge. Patient-level factors were compared between high-cost group and all others using Welch 's two-sample t-test and ANOVA. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine predictors of higher cost. There were 176 CLABSI admissions among 68 patients over the study period ( median 2 hospitalizations per patients). The mean cost and length of stay ( LOS) per hospital admission are $ 28,375 ( 2015 US dollars) and 8 days , and both were associated with intensive care unit admission ( ICU) , central venous catheter ( CVC) removal , private insurance , and age < 2 at admission. Nine percent of patients were classified as `` super-utilizers '' whose 54 hospitalizations accounted for 28 % of total institutional costs. Among pediatric HPN patients , community-acquired CLABSI is associated with significant cost and LOS. Healthcare utilization is disproportionately concentrated in a small number of patients. These study findings may help inform cost analysis for future CLABSI prevention strategies.
