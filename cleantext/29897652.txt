  In recent years the interest of shape-persistent organic cage compounds synthesized by dynamic covalent chemistry ( DCC) has risen , because these cages are potentially interesting for gas sorption or- separation. One such reaction in DCC is the condensation of boronic acids with diols to form boronic esters. Most interestingly , the variety of geometries and sizes for boronic ester cages is much lower than that of , for example , imine-based cages. Here , a small series of shape-persistent ( 4 +6) tetrahedral boronic ester cages is introduced. One cage has a high specific surface area of 511 m
