  Transactivating DNA-binding protein-43 ( TDP-43) deposits represent a typical finding in almost all ALS patients , more than half of FTLD patients and patients with several other neurodegenerative disorders. It appears that perturbation of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport is an important event in these conditions but the mechanistic role and the fate of TDP-43 during neuronal degeneration remain elusive. We have developed an experimental system for visualising the perturbed nucleocytoplasmic transport of neuronal TDP-43 at the single-cell level in vivo using zebrafish spinal cord. This approach enabled us to image TDP-43-expressing motor neurons before and after experimental initiation of cell death. We report the formation of mobile TDP-43 deposits within degenerating motor neurons , which are normally phagocytosed by microglia. However , when microglial cells were depleted , injury-induced motor neuron degeneration follows a characteristic process that includes TDP-43 redistribution into the cytoplasm , axon and extracellular space. This is the first demonstration of perturbed TDP-43 nucleocytoplasmic transport in vivo , and suggests that impairment in microglial phagocytosis of dying neurons may contribute towards the formation of pathological TDP-43 presentations in ALS and FTLD.
