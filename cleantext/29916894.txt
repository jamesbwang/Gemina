  Pseudogynecomastia is the increased aggregation of fatty tissue in the area of the male breast with resultant female appearance. Two forms can appear: pseudogynecomastia after massive weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( pseudogynecomastia obese ( PO)) and pseudogynecomastia , which is caused only by adipose tissue ( pseudogynecomastia fat). For PO , only the Gusenoff classification with corresponding operative treatment options exists. However , this classification is limited by the fact that it underestimates the extensive variability of residual fat tissue and skin<symptom> excess<symptom> , both crucial factors for operative planning. For this reason , we propose a modification of the treatment algorithm for the Gusenoff classification based on our results to achieve more masculine results. A total of 43 male patients with PO were included in this retrospective study ( grade 1a , n = 1; grade 1b , n = 1; grade 2 , n = 17; grade 3 , n = 24). Forty-two mastectomies with a free nipple-areola complex ( NAC) transposition ( grades 2 and 3) and 1 with a subcutaneous mastectomy ( grade 1a) with periareolar lifting were performed. A retrospective chart review was performed to obtain data regarding age , body mass index , body mass index loss , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , reason for weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , comorbidities , nicotine , and additional procedures , postoperative sensitive on the NAC transplants and complications. None of the free-nipple grafts were lost. Forty ( 95 %) of 42 patients with mastectomy had a resensitivity on the NAC. For pseudogynecomastia , the treatment algorithm of the Gusenoff classification should be modified and adapted according to our recommendations to achieve more optimal masculine results.
