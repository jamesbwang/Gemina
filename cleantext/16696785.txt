  The Montreal classification defines L4 Crohn 's disease ( CD) as any disease location proximal to the terminal ileum , which anatomically includes L4-esophagogastroduodenal ( EGD) , L4-jejunal , and L4-proximal ileal involvement. L4-jejunal disease was established to be associated with poor prognosis. However , the outcome of patients with L4-proximal ileal disease or L4-EGD remains to be clarified. Our study aimed to investigate whether the outcome differs among CD patients with L4-EGD , L4-jejunal , and L4-proximal ileal disease. In our retrospective cohort study , 483 patients with confirmed CD were included. The primary outcome was intestinal surgery. Demographic features and outcomes were compared among L4-EGD , L4-jejunal , and L4-proximal ileal disease. Thirty-nine ( 8.1 %) patients had isolated L4 disease , whereas 146 patients had L4 as well as concomitant L1 , L2 , or L3 disease. During a median follow up of 5.8 years , L4 patients were more likely to have intestinal surgeries compared to non-L4 patients ( 31 % L4 disease had worse prognosis compared to non-L4 disease. Within L4 disease , phenotype of L4-jejunal and L4-proximal ileal disease indicated higher risk for intestinal surgery. It might be justified to further characterize the L4 phenotype of the Montreal classification into three specific subgroups including L4-EGD , L4-jejunal , and L4-proximal ileal disease , similar to the Paris classification of pediatric patients.
