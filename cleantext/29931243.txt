  The main purpose of this work was to evaluate the effects of jugular L-arginine infusion on antioxidant mechanisms in lactating dairy cows challenged intravenously with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS). Eight multiparous Holstein cows ( 609 ± 32 kg) at mid-lactation were randomly assigned to 5-d jugular infusions of Control ( saline) , Arginine ( Arg , 18 g/d) , LPS ( 0.2 μg/kg BW per d) , and LPS + Arginine ( 0.2 μg/kg BW per d of LPS and 18 g/d of Arg) in a replicated 4 4 Latin square design with 4 infusion periods separated by 10-d. Jugular solutions of saline , Arg , LPS , and LPS + Arg were continuously infused using peristaltic pumps for approximately 6 h/d. Jugular vein serum samples were obtained on the last day of each infusion period before infusion ( 0 h) and at 3 and 6 h post-infusion. Compared with LPS treatment , Arg infusion increased the total antioxidant capacity and activity of glutathione peroxidase , but decreased malonaldehyde concentration ( P < 0.05). The concentration of nitric oxide in serum and the activity of nitric oxide synthase were greater in LPS treatment compared with saline and Arg ( P < 0.05). The Arg treatment significantly increased the serum insulin concentration at 3 h post-infusion compared with the saline treatment ( P < 0.05) , and that of LPS and LPS + Arg treatments were in between Arg and LPS treatments. No treatment effect was observed on the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase ( P > 0.05). In conclusion , enhancing the supply of Arg during an inflammatory challenge enhances antioxidant mechanisms in lactating dairy cows.
