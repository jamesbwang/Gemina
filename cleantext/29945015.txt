  A solvothermal-assisted evaporation-induced self-assembly ( SA-EISA) approach has been developed for the synthesis of ordered mesoporous alumina ( OMA) materials with high thermal stability and improved performance in catalysis. In conventional EISA process , the evaporation step is accompanied by the hydrolysis of organic aluminum precursors , thus the evaporation conditions have significant influences on the reaction and the final structure of OMA. In our approach , the solvothermal treatment step promotes the complete hydrolysis of aluminum precursors and produces partially condensed cluster-like aluminum hydroxyl species , which allows the formation of OMA in a broad range of evaporation conditions. Compared to mesoporous alumina obtained by conventional EISA process , OMA materials prepared by SA-EISA approach exhibit higher specific surface area , pore volume and thermal stability. When used as supporting materials for vanadium oxide catalyst , OMA materials obtained by the SA-EISA approach exhibit excellent activity , selectivity and stability for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant. Our contribution has provided new understanding in the synthesis of OMA materials with improved performance for catalytic applications.
