  This is an in-depth review on the mechanism of action , clinical utility , and drug-drug interactions of colchicine in the management of pericardial disease. Recent evidence about therapeutic targets on pericarditis<disease> has demonstrated that NALP3 inflammasome blockade is the cornerstone in the clinical benefits of colchicine. Such benefits extend from acute and recurrent pericarditis<disease> to transient constriction and post-pericardiotomy syndrome<disease>. Despite the increased utilization of colchicine in cardiovascular medicine , safety concerns remains unsolved regarding the long-term use of colchicine in the cardiac patient. Moreover , recent evidence has demonstrated that numerous cardiovascular medications , ranging from antihypertensive medication to antiarrhythmics , are known to interact with the CYP3A4 and/or P-gp system increasing the toxicity potential of colchicine. The use of adjunctive colchicine in the management of inflammatory pericardial diseases is standard of care in current practice. It is advised that a careful medication reconciliation with emphasis on pharmacokinetic is completed before prescribing colchicine in order to avoid harmful interaction by finding an alternative regimen or adjusting colchicine dosing.
