  The tegu lizard Salvator merianae is a large , widely distributed teiid lizard endemic to South America that exhibits annual cycles of high activity during the spring and summer , and hibernation during winter. This pattern of activity and hibernation is accompanied by profound seasonal changes in physiology and behavior , including endothermy during the austral spring. The unusual combination of seasonal endothermy , hibernation and oviparity , in a non-avian , non-mammalian species , makes S. merianae an interesting subject for study of comparative aspects of endocrine regulation of seasonal changes in physiology. In the present study , we first validated commercially available immunoassay kits for quantification of hormone concentrations of the reproductive ( testosterone , estradiol and progesterone) , adrenal ( corticosterone) , and thyroid ( thyroxine ( T
