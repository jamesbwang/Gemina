  The case of an 18-year-old woman with generalized short root anomaly ( SRA) is presented , and the clinical management and challenges associated with this rare condition are discussed. The patient was referred for restoration of the edentulous maxillary left anterior region. Due to the SRA , the patient had previously received limited orthodontic treatment for the ectopic maxillary canines. The maxillary left canine failed during orthodontic traction , the left lateral incisor migrated in its region and had poor prognosis due to severe mobility. Therefore , it was extracted and the region was restored with an implant-supported cantilever metal-ceramic fixed partial denture. Radiographic examination revealed generalized SRA along with other dental anomalies. From the patient 's family history , as well as from the physical , clinical , radiographic , biochemical , and histologic evaluations , we were unable to identify the etiology behind this unique combination of dental anomalies. Esthetics and function were successfully restored and a strict recall system was implemented in order to monitor and maintain the short-rooted teeth. The need to prevent tooth and periodontal tissue deterioration in patients with generalized short roots is emphasized.
