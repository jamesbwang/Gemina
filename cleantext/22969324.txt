  This work analyzes the results of measurements on thermal energy harvesting through a wearable Thermo-electric Generator ( TEG) placed on the arms and legs. Four large skin areas were chosen as locations for the placement of the TEGs. In order to place the generator on the body , a special manufactured band guaranteed the proper contact between the skin and TEG. Preliminary measurements were performed to find out the value of the resistor load which maximizes the power output. Then , an experimental investigation was conducted for the measurement of harvested energy while users were performing daily activities , such as sitting , walking , jogging , and riding a bike. The generated power values were in the range from 5 to 50 & mu; W. Moreover , a preliminary hypothesis based on the obtained results indicates the possibility to use TEGs on leg for the recognition of locomotion activities. It is due to the rather high and different biomechanical work , produced by the gastrocnemius muscle , while the user is walking rather than jogging or riding a bike. This result reflects a difference between temperatures associated with the performance of different activities.
