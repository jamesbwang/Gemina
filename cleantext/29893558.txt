  Three new cyclopeptides , phakellistatins 20-22 ( 1-3) , as well as 10 known cyclopeptides of the same structural class were isolated from the tropical sponge Stylissa flabelliformis. By a combination of chemical and spectroscopic methods , the structures of the new compounds were determined to be an epimeric mixture of cycloheptapeptides ( 1) and two epimeric cyclodecapeptides ( 2 and 3) related to the phakellistatins. The cyclopeptides were evaluated for in vitro cytotoxicity against a variety of cancer cell lines , and compounds 2 and 3 exhibited significant activity.
