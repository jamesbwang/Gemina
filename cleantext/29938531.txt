  This paper introduces the significant theoretical contribution of Georges Devereux ( 1908-85) on the relationship between culture and psychism , which he developed in his work at the interface of anthropology , psychoanalysis and quantum epistemology during the mid-twentieth century. Devereux was one of the key early contributors to the field of transcultural psychiatry; he was in touch with its most important exponents , although he remained critical of many of the popular trends developed in this field of research in the USA , where Devereux conducted most of his research between 1932 and 1963. As a part of his critique , he founded a new epistemology: ethnopsychoanalysis , which was largely based on the concept of complementarity and countertransference.
