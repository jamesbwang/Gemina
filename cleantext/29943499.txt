  The recently developed 3D bioprinting technology has greatly improved the ability to generate biomimetic tissues that are structurally and functionally relevant to their human counterparts. The selection of proper biomaterials as the bioinks is a key step toward successful bioprinting. For example , viscosity of a bioink is an important rheological parameter to determine the flexibility in deposition of free-standing structures and the maintenance of architectural integrity following bioprinting. This requirement , however , has greatly limited the selection of bioinks , especially for those naturally derived due to their commonly low mechanical properties. Here the generalization of a mechanism for extrusion bioprinting of bio-macromolecular components , mainly focusing on collagen and its derivatives including gelatin and gelatin methacryloyl , is reported. Specifically , a templating strategy is adopted using a composite bioink containing both the desired bio-macromolecular component and a polysaccharide alginate. The physically crosslinkable alginate component serves as the temporal structural support to stabilize the shape of the construct during bioprinting; upon subsequent chemical or physical crosslinking of the bio-macromolecular component , alginate can be selectively removed to leave only the desired bio-macromolecule. It is anticipated that this strategy is general , and can be readily expanded for use of a wide variety of other bio-macromolecular bioinks.
