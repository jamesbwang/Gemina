  An 8-year-old castrated male cat presented with acute<symptom> ataxia<symptom> and paresis in all four limbs. The cat also exhibited signs of autonomic nervous system impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed swelling of the brachial plexuses bilaterally. Despite treatment , the cat died after 10 days of treatment. A postmortem examination revealed swollen radial nerves and cervical nerve roots in which infiltration of inflammatory cells was histologically confirmed. Additionally , lymphocytic infiltration was found around the blood vessels of the sciatic nerve bundle and the vagus nerve. Histological features were comparable to previously reported brachial plexus hypertrophic neuritis in a cat. Our case was unique in that the autonomic nerves were also involved in addition to the somatic nerves in all four limbs.
