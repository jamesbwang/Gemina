  In this work we design , by means of a non-neutral plasma method , a linear trapping model for large ion clouds , which will become the core of an atomic clock. We first obtain the geometry and electromagnetic characteristics of the ion trap. We then perform a systematic analysis describing the main parameters of the ion cloud such as size , secular frequency and ion number per unit length in terms of temperature. The most appropriate operation point of the ion trap in terms of a set of these specific parameters is evaluated and a thorough discussion is performed about how minor perturbations introduced in these parameters affect , in a nonlinear response , the performance of the trapping system in terms of sensibility , heating and RF potential.
