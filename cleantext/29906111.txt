  We present a thorough investigation of the errors in results obtained with the combination of frozen-density embedding theory and the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme for the polarization propagator of second order ( FDE-ADC ( 2)). The study was carried out on a set of 52 intermolecular complexes with varying interaction strength , each consisting of a chromophore of fundamental interest and a few small molecules in its environment. The errors emerging in frozen-density embedding theory-based methods originate from ( a) the solver of the quantum many-body problem used to obtain the embedded wave function ( Î¨
