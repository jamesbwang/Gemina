  Growth hormone deficiency ( GHD) is an endocrine disorder characterized by insufficient production of growth hormone ( GH). Non-functioning pituitary adenoma ( NFPA) is one of common causes of GHD. Although most patients with NFPA have transsphenoidal surgery , the time-dependent changes in GH after operation have yet to be investigated. In this study , we analyzed patients with NFPAs that underwent transsphenoidal surgery. Postoperatively , GH secretion was evaluated in response to GH-releasing peptide-2 ( GHRP2) infusion. We also investigated how several factors affected GH dynamics. Of 119 patients analyzed , 94 ( 79.0 %) had peak GH levels less than 9.0 ng/mL and were diagnosed with severe GHD ( sGHD) immediately after surgery. Of those patients , 27 ( 28.7 %) recovered from sGHD within 1-2 years after surgery. Univariate analyses confirmed that sGHD recovery improved significantly in patients that were younger , had only undergone a single primary surgery , had not had anterior hormone deficiency except GH , and had cystic adenoma or normal insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF1) standard deviation score ( SD-S) levels immediately after surgery. Multivariate analyses confirmed that younger age and absence of hormone replacement therapy significantly predicted sGHD recovery within 1-2 years after surgery. Taken together , our results indicated that postoperative sGHD should be assessed by GHRP2 infusion , regardless of IGF1 SD-S levels. Furthermore , recovery from sGHD occurs more frequently at 1-2 years after surgery especially in younger patients and/or those with GH deficiency alone. These patients , therefore , should be reassessed for GHD by appropriate tests including GHRP2 test at 1-2 years after surgery.
