  Despite the significant impacts of agricultural land on nonpoint source ( NPS) nitrogen ( N) pollution , little is known about the influence of the distribution and composition of different agricultural land uses on N export at the watershed scale. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ( SWAT) to quantify how agricultural distribution ( i.e. , the spatial distributions of agricultural land uses) and composition ( i.e. , the relative percentages of different types of agricultural land uses) influenced N export from a Chinese subtropical watershed , accounting for aquatic N retention by river networks. Nitrogen sources displayed high spatial variability , with 40.7 % of the total N ( TN) export from the watershed as a whole derived from several subwatersheds that accounted for only 18 % of the watershed area. These subwatersheds were all located close to the watershed mouth<symptom>. Agricultural composition strongly affected inputs to the river network. The percentages of dry agricultural land and rice paddy fields , and the number of cattle together explained 70.5 % of the variability of the TN input to the river network among different subwatersheds. Total N loading to the river network was positively correlated with the percentage of dry land in total land areas and the number of cattle within subwatersheds , but negatively with the proportion of paddy fields. Distribution of agricultural land uses also affected N export at the mouth<symptom> of the watershed. Moreover , N retention in the river network increased with increasing N transport distance from source subwatershed to the watershed mouth<symptom>. Results provide important information to support improved planning of agricultural land uses at the watershed scale that reduces NPS nutrient pollution.
