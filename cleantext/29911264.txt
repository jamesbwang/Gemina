  This study focused on the evaluation of mixotrophic and heterotrophic production of phycocyanin by A. microscopica , analysis of kinetic parameters , the effect of freezing and thawing on phycocyanin yield , and nutrient removal during heterotrophic growth. During mixotrophic growth , maximum phycocyanin yield ( 1.50 mg
