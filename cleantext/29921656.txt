  Mechanically activated , slowly adapting currents in sensory neurons have been linked to noxious mechanosensation. The conotoxin NMB-1 ( noxious mechanosensation blocker-1) blocks such currents and inhibits mechanical pain. Using a biotinylated form of NMB-1 in mass spectrometry analysis , we identified 67 binding proteins in sensory neurons and a sensory neuron-derived cell line , of which the top candidate was annexin A6 , a membrane-associated calcium-binding protein. Annexin A6-deficient mice showed increased sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. Sensory neurons from these mice showed increased activity of the cation channel Piezo2 , which mediates a rapidly adapting mechano-gated current linked to proprioception<symptom> and touch , and a decrease in mechanically activated , slowly adapting currents. Conversely , overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory neurons inhibited rapidly adapting currents that were partially mediated by Piezo2. Furthermore , overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory neurons attenuated mechanical pain in a mouse model of osteoarthritis , a disease in which mechanically evoked pain is particularly problematic. These data suggest that annexin A6 can be exploited to inhibit chronic mechanical pain.
