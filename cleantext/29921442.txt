  To ascertain current percutaneous lung biopsy practices around the UK. A web-based survey was sent to all British Society of Thoracic Imaging ( BSTI) and British Society of Interventional Radiology ( BSIR) members ( May 2017) assessing all aspects of lung biopsy practice. Responses were collected anonymously. Two hundred and thirty-nine completed responses were received ( 28.8 % response rate). Of the respondents , 48.5 % worked in a teaching hospital and 51.5 % in a district general hospital , while 32.6 % ( 78/239) were specialist thoracic radiologists , 29.2 % ( 70/239) `` general '' radiologists with a thoracic subspecialty interest , and 28 % ( 67/239) interventional radiologists. Of the respondents , 30.1 % ( 72/239) did not require pre-biopsy lung function tests ( PFTs); 45.6 % ( 108/237) stopped aspirin before the procedure; 97.5 % primarily use computed tomography ( CT) guidance for biopsy and 88.7 % ( 212/239) perform core needle biopsy ( CNB); and 86.6 % of radiologists use a co-axial technique. There was wide variation in the number of samples routinely taken with most radiologists performing 1-2 passes ( 55.9 %) or 3-4 passes ( 40.8 %). Sixty-four percent reported using chest drain prevention techniques to minimise the impact of iatrogenic pneumothorax , with needle aspiration most frequent ( 43.9 %). Timing of post-biopsy chest radiography ( CXR) , performed by 95.8 % ( 228/239) , also varied greatly: most commonly at either 1 hour ( 23 %) , 2 hours ( 24.7 %) , or 4 hours ( 22.6 %). Moreover , the time of patient discharge after uncomplicated biopsy was variable , although the majority ( 66.1 %) discharge patients after â‰¥ 4 hours. There are striking variations among surveyed UK radiologists performing lung biopsy in decision-making , pre-biopsy work-up , post-biopsy monitoring , management of pneumothorax , and discharge. The results suggest a need for new updated national percutaneous lung biopsy guidelines.
