  In uncomplicated type B aortic dissection ( UTBAD) , the `` gold standard '' has been nonoperative treatment with medical therapy , although this has been questioned by studies demonstrating improved outcomes in those treated with thoracic endovascular aortic repair ( TEVAR). This study assessed long-term survival after acute UTBAD comparing medical therapy , open repair , and TEVAR. The California Office of Statewide Hospital Planning Development database was analyzed from 2000 to 2010 for adult patients with acute UTBAD. Patients with nonemergent admission for aortic dissection , type A dissection , trauma , bowel ischemia , lower extremity ischemia , acidosis , or shock<symptom> were excluded. The cohort was stratified by treatment type at index admission into medical therapy , open surgical repair , and TEVAR. Multivariable regression and survival analyses were used to evaluate the association of treatment type with long-term overall survival. There were 9165 cases , 95 % medical therapy , 2 % open repair , and 2.9 % TEVAR. The mean age was 66 Â± 15 years , with 39 % female , 2.4 % cocaine users , 18 % with congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , and 17 % with Charlson Comorbidity Index > 3. Mean inpatient costs were $ 57,000 for medical therapy , $ 200,000 for open repair , and $ 130,000 for TEVAR ( P < .01). Inpatient mortality was 6.5 % overall , 6.3 % for medical therapy , 14 % for open repair , and 7.1 % for TEVAR ( P < .01). One-year and 5-year survivals were 84 % and 60 % in medical therapy , 76 % and 67 % in open repair , and 85 % and 76 % in TEVAR ( log-rank , P < .01). On risk-adjusted multivariable analysis , TEVAR had improved survival compared with medical therapy ( hazard ratio , 0.68; 95 % confidence interval , 0.6-0.8; P < .01) , with no difference between open repair and medical therapy ( hazard ratio , 1.0; 95 % confidence interval , 0.8-1.3; P < .01). This statewide study on survival after acute UTBADs shows an independent survival advantage for TEVAR over medical therapy. These data add further evidence for a paradigm shift in acute management of type B dissection in favor of early TEVAR.
