  Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( MEN1) is complex with regard to clinical expressions , management , and molecular pathways. Advances are being made broadly and in focused aspects. Selected topics are presented for their developments since publication of the most recent MEN1 consensus guidelines 6 years ago. Topics were selected for clinical impact or broad interest or both. For each topic , information was obtained from original reports and reviews. The selected topics are as follows: tumor behavior and breast cancer in MEN1; foregut neuroectoderm tumor screening , biomarkers periodically to detect tumor emergence of foregut neuroectoderm tumors , 68Ga dotatate positron emission tomography/computed tomography for pancreatic and duodenal neuroectodermal tumor imaging , and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor scintigraphy for insulinoma; therapy , the size of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( NET) as one criterion for surgery , minimally invasive surgery of pancreatic NETs , and 177Lu dotatate therapy; MEN1 gene , the search for the MEN1/menin pathway and MEN1 or GCM2 mutation in familial isolated hyperparathyroidism , and MEN1 mutation-positive vs mutation-negative cases of MEN1 are different. MEN1 topics are a rich and fast-moving area. Important highlights stand out , and major and rapid advances will continue into the near future.
