  Non-tumorous skin pigmentation disorders can have a huge negative emotional impact on patients. The correct diagnosis of these disorders is essential for proper treatments to be instituted. In this paper , we present a computerized method for classifying five non-tumorous skin pigmentation disorders ( i.e. , freckles , lentigines , Hori 's nevus , melasma and nevus of Ota) based on probabilistic linear discriminant analysis ( PLDA). To address the large within-class variance problem with pigmentation images , a voting based PLDA ( V-PLDA) approach is proposed. The proposed V-PLDA method is tested on a dataset that contains 150 real-world images taken from patients. It is shown that the proposed V-PLDA method obtains significantly higher classification accuracy ( 4 % or more with p < 0.001 in the analysis of variance ( ANOVA) test) than the original PLDA method , as well as several state-of-the-art image classification methods. To the authors ' best knowledge , this is the first study that focuses on the non-tumorous skin pigmentation image classification problem. Therefore , this paper could provide a benchmark for subsequent research on this topic. Additionally , the proposed V-PLDA method demonstrates promising performance in clinical applications related to skin pigmentation disorders.
