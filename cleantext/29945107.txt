  Sofosbuvir ( SOF) and ledipasvir ( LDS) represent anti-hepatitis C binary mixture. Herein , a fast high-performance thin-layer chromatography ( HPTLC) method was developed , validated and applied for simultaneous determination of SOF and LDS in biological matrix. An innovative strategy was designed which based on coupling dual wavelength detection with HPTLC. This strategy enabled sensitive , specific , high sample throughput and cost-effective determination of the SOF-LDS binary mixture. The developed HPTLC procedure is based on a simple liquid-liquid extraction , enrichment of the analytes and subsequent separation with UV detection. Separations were performed on HPTLC silica gel 60 F
