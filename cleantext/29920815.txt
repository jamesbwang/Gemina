  ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas give rise to a severe endocrinological disorder , i.e. , Cushing 's disease , with multifaceted clinical presentation and treatment outcomes. Experimental studies suggested that disease variability is inherent to the pituitary tumor , thus pointing to the need for further studies into tumor biology. Aim of the present study was to evaluate transcriptome expression pattern in a large series of ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma specimens , in order to identify molecular signatures of these tumors. Gene expression profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens from 40 human ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas revealed significant expression of genes involved in protein biosynthesis and ribosomal function , in keeping with neuroendocrine cell profile. Unsupervised cluster analysis identified three distinct gene profile clusters and several genes were uniquely overexpressed in a given cluster , accounting for different molecular signatures. Of note , gene expression profiles were associated with clinical features such as age and size of the tumor. Altogether , our study shows that corticotrope tumors are characterized by neuroendocrine gene expression profile and present subgroup-specific molecular features.
