  Cancer metastasis has been a major impediment to effective cancer treatment and is the major cause of cancer-related death. Polyphenols compounds have been reported to possess anti-metastasis activity through their inhibitory activity of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs). In this paper , twelve polyphenols compounds , including three novel phenols , named selaphenins A-C ( 1-3) , two known selaginellin derivatives ( 4 and 5) , together with seven known biflavonoids ( 6-12) were isolated from the plant of Selaginella tamariscina. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses. Notably , polyphenols compound 10 suppressed the migration of A549 cells by primary targeting MMP-9. The antitumor activity of compound 10 was possibly due to the induction of cell apoptosis through intrinsic apoptosis pathways , accompanied by increasing the expression of Bax and caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner. This study provides evidence that polyphenols analogues from S. tamariscina as inhibitors of MMP-9 exhibited potential migration inhibition activities.
