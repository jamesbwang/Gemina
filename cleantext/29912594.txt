  Prospective identification of candidates for deferred therapy is not standardized and many patients receive immediate therapy regardless of risk. We conducted a retrospective , multi-center cohort analysis of MCL patients with comprehensive clinical data to examine the use and safety of deferred therapy for newly diagnosed patients. Previously untreated patients â‰¥ 18 years-old with MCL diagnosed in 1993-2015 at five academic sites were included. Of 395 patients , 72 ( 18 %) received deferred therapy ( defined as receipt of first treatment > 90 days following initial diagnosis). Patients receiving deferred therapy were more likely to have an ECOG performance status of 0 ( 67 versus 44 % p = .001) , have no B symptoms ( 83 versus 65 % p = .003) and have normal LDH levels at diagnosis ( 87 versus 55 % p < .001). In multivariable analysis , deferred therapy was not associated with a significant difference in OS ( HR 0.64: 95 % CI 0.22-1.84 , p = .407).
