  Optimal adjunctive therapy in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) patients treated with primary PCI ( PPCI) remains a matter of debate. Our aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of bivalirudin to unfractionated heparin ( UFH) , with or without glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors ( GPI) in a large real-world population , using data from the Swedish national registry , SWEDEHEART. From 2008 to 2014 we identified 23,800 STEMI patients presenting within 12 hours from symptom onset treated with PPCI and UFH ± GPI or bivalirudin ± GPI. Primary outcomes included 30-day all-cause mortality and major in-hospital bleeding. Multivariable regression models and propensity score modelling were utilized to study adjusted association between treatment and outcome. Treatment with UFH ± GPI was associated with similar risk of 30-day mortality compared to bivalirudin ± GPI ( 5.3 % vs 5.5 % , adjusted HR 0.94; 95 % CI 0.82-1.07). The adjusted risk for 1-year mortality , 30-day and 1-year stent thrombosis and re-infarction did not differ significantly between UFH ± GPI and bivalirudin ± GPI. In contrast , treatment with UFH ± GPI was associated with a significant higher risk of major in-hospital bleeding ( adjusted OR 1.62; 95 % CI 1.30-2.03). When including GPI use in the multivariable analysis , the difference was attenuated and no longer significant ( adjusted OR 1.25; 95 % CI 0.92-1.70). Bivalirudin ± GPI was associated with significantly lower risk for major inhospital bleeding but no significant difference in 30-day or one year mortality , stent thrombosis or re-infarction compared with UFH ± GPI. The bleeding reduction associated with bivalirudin could be explained by the greater GPI use with UFH.
