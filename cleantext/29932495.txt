  Ageing plays a fundamental role in arterial blood transport and heat transfer within a human body. The aim of this work is to provide a comprehensive methodology , based on biomechanical considerations , for modelling arterial flow and energy exchange mechanisms in the body accounting for age-induced changes. The study outlines a framework for age-related modifications within several interlinked subsystems , which include arterial stiffening , heart contractility variations , tissue volume and property changes , and thermoregulatory system deterioration. Some of the proposed age-dependent governing equations are directly extrapolated from experimental data sets. The computational framework is demonstrated through numerical experiments , which show the impact of such age-related changes on arterial blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , local temperature distribution , and global body thermal response. The proposed numerical experiments show that the age-related changes in arterial convection do not significantly affect the tissue temperature distribution. Results also highlight age-related effects on the sweating mechanism , which lead to a significant reduction in heat dissipation and a subsequent rise in skin and core temperatures.
