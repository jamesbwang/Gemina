  Checkpoint blockade enhances effector T cell function and has elicited long-term remission in a subset of patients with a broad spectrum of cancers. TIGIT is a checkpoint receptor thought to be involved in mediating T cell exhaustion<symptom> in tumors; however , the relevance of TIGIT to the dysfunction of natural killer ( NK) cells remains poorly understood. Here we found that TIGIT , but not the other checkpoint molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1 , was associated with NK cell exhaustion<symptom> in tumor-bearing mice and patients with colon cancer. Blockade of TIGIT prevented NK cell exhaustion<symptom> and promoted NK cell-dependent tumor immunity in several tumor-bearing mouse models. Furthermore , blockade of TIGIT resulted in potent tumor-specific T cell immunity in an NK cell-dependent manner , enhanced therapy with antibody to the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 and sustained memory immunity in tumor re-challenge models. This work demonstrates that TIGIT constitutes a previously unappreciated checkpoint in NK cells and that targeting TIGIT alone or in combination with other checkpoint receptors is a promising anti-cancer therapeutic strategy.
