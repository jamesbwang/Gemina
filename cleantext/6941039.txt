  Obtaining detailed individual-level data on both exposure and cancer outcomes is challenging , and it is difficult to understand and characterize how temporal aspects of exposures translate into cancer risk. We show that , in lieu of individual-level information , population-level data on cancer incidence and etiologic agent prevalence can be leveraged to investigate cancer mechanisms and to better characterize and predict cancer trends. We use mechanistic carcinogenesis models ( multistage clonal expansion ( MSCE) models) and data on smoking ,
