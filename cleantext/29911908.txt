  To examine possible changes in the levels of salivary antioxidants , C-reactive protein ( CRP) , cortisol , pH , proteins , and blood in patients treated with fixed orthodontic appliances. Salivary samples from 21 orthodontic patients who met specific inclusion criteria were collected before the beginning of orthodontic treatment ( T0; baseline) , 1 hour after bonding ( T1) , and 4-6 weeks after bonding ( T2). Oxidant-scavenging ability ( OSA) was quantified using a luminol-dependent chemiluminescence assay. Cortisol and CRP levels were measured using immunoassay kits. pH levels and presence of proteins and blood in the samples were quantified using strip-based tests. A significant decrease in salivary pH was observed after bonding ( P = .013). An increase in oxidant-scavenging abilities during orthodontic treatment was detected , but the change was not statistically significant. Cortisol and CRP levels slightly increased after bonding , but the difference was small without statistical significance. Changes in the presence of proteins and blood were also insignificant. Exposure to fixed orthodontic appliances did not show a significant effect on salivary parameters related to inflammation<symptom> or stress , with the exception of a significant but transient pH decrease after bonding.
