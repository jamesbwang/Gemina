  There are several techniques for treating atlantoaxial instability , including the Magerl transarticular screw fixation and the Harms/Goel C1-C2 screw rod techniques. Here , we present a novel technique utilizing a polyaxial screw rod system and a combination of C1 lateral mass and C1-C2 transarticular screws. We retrospectively reviewed 14 patients ( 7 women , 7 men; mean age 62) who underwent surgery for type II odontoid fractures ( Intraoperatively , there were no complications ( e.g. , vertebral artery , nerve root , or spinal cord injury). Postoperative imaging showed no screw malpositioning , and no screw loosening , fracture , or bone absorption around the screws. Furthermore , all patients exhibited postoperative improvement in neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. C1 lateral mass and C1-C2 transarticular polyaxial screw rod fixation techniques were effective in achieving immediate rigid immobilization of the C1-C2 motion segment.
