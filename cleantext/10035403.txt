  In ultra-high resolution ( UHR-) optical coherence tomography ( OCT) group velocity dispersion ( GVD) must be corrected for in order to approach the theoretical resolution limit. One approach promises not only compensation , but complete annihilation of even order dispersion effects , and that at all sample depths. This approach has hitherto been demonstrated with an experimentally demanding ` balanced detection ' configuration based on using two detectors. We demonstrate intensity correlation ( IC) OCT using a conventional spectral domain ( SD) UHR-OCT system with a single detector. IC-SD-OCT configurations exhibit cross term ghost images and a reduced axial range , half of that of conventional SD-OCT. We demonstrate that both shortcomings can be removed by applying a generic artefact reduction algorithm and using analytic interferograms. We show the superiority of IC-SD-OCT compared to conventional SD-OCT by showing how IC-SD-OCT is able to image spatial structures behind a strongly dispersive silicon wafer. Finally , we question the resolution enhancement of ( Formula: see text) that IC-SD-OCT is often believed to have compared to SD-OCT. We show that this is simply the effect of squaring the reflectivity profile as a natural result of processing the product of two intensity spectra instead of a single spectrum.
