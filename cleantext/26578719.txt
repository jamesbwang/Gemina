  To analyze , from the immunohistochemical perspective , the effects of hyaluronic acid of different molecular weights in an experimental model of osteoarthritis in rabbits. Forty-four male California rabbits were randomly assigned to three different groups ( PR , S , and P) and submitted to the resection of the anterior cruciate ligament of the right knee. Three weeks after the surgical procedure , three intra-articular weekly injections were carried out with low-molecular-weight native hyaluronic acid ( Hyalgan The chondroprotective effect of the hyaluronic acids used in the study was demonstrated when compared to the control group. However , the comparison between them presented no significant statistical difference regarding chondroprotection. The injection of saline solution demonstrated signs of OA development , while adding native hyaluronic acid of low molecular weight ( Hyalgan
