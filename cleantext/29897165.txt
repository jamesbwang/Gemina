  Homoaromatic compounds are currently viewed mainly as an interesting novelty with little to no practical application. Based on calculations within density functional theory , we show that the unique charge redirection properties of tricoordinate boron , along with it being isolobal to a carbocation , allow for a larger range of two-electron donors to be utilized , leading to the rational design of homoaromatic compounds better suited to functionalization. Among others , these compounds show a strong dependency on the relative positioning of the hetero-atoms within the ring system , a modulation control rendered possible by the insertion of the boron centres.
