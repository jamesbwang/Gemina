  Psychotropic medication is widely prescribed to treat mental illness. However , it is controversial when used as a chemical restraint ( CR) to manage challenging behaviours ( CBs) of adults with intellectual disability ( ID). CR has potentially negative consequences and affects human rights. Qualitative research conducted between 2014 and 2015 explored the views of ` guardian ' decision makers appointed under unique Queensland legislation oversighting the use of CR. Findings included ( 1) negative conceptualization of CR , ( 2) concerning relationships with prescribers and disability sector staff , ( 3) challenges to information seeking about people with ID prescribed CR and ( 4) problematic implementation of positive behaviour support plans. According to guardians , CR may be used in lieu of community supports , and prescribers sometimes diagnose mental illness to avoid CR legislative requirements. Guardians , prescribers and professionals would benefit from training that addresses the intersection between physical and mental health , CB and CR.
