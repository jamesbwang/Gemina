  Recent studies , primarily in non-Hispanic whites , suggest that dietary patterns have distinct metabolomic signatures that may influence disease risk. However , evidence in South Asians , a group with unique dietary patterns and a high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk , is lacking. We investigated the metabolomic profiles associated with 2 distinct dietary patterns among a sample of Asian Indians living in the United States. We also examined the cross-sectional associations between metabolomic profiles and cardiometabolic risk markers. We used cross-sectional data from 145 Asian Indians , aged 45-79 y , in the Metabolic Syndrome<disease> and Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America ( MASALA) pilot study. Metabolomic profiles were measured from fasting serum samples. Usual diet was assessed by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. We used principal components analysis to derive dietary and metabolomic patterns. We used adjusted general linear regression models to examine associations between dietary patterns , individual food groups , metabolite patterns , and cardiometabolic risk markers. We observed 2 major principal components or metabolite clusters , the first comprised primarily of medium- to long-chain acylcarnitines ( metabolite pattern 1) and the second characterized by branched-chain amino acids , aromatic amino acids , and short-chain acylcarnitines ( metabolite pattern 2). A `` Western/nonvegetarian '' pattern was significantly and positively associated with metabolite pattern 2 ( all participants: β ± SE = 0.180 ± 0.090 , P = 0.05; participants without type 2 diabetes: β ± SE = 0.323 ± 0.090 , P = 0.0005). In all participants , higher scores on metabolite pattern 2 were adversely associated with measures of glycemia ( fasting insulin: β ± SE = 2.91 ± 1.29 , P = 0.03; 2-h insulin: β ± SE = 22.1 ± 10.3 , P = 0.03; homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance: β ± SE = 0.94 ± 0.42 , P = 0.03) , total adiponectin ( β ± SE = -1.46 ± 0.47 , P = 0.002) , lipids ( total cholesterol: β ± SE = 7.51 ± 3.45 , P = 0.03; triglycerides: β ± SE = 14.4 ± 6.67 , P = 0.03) , and a radiographic measure of hepatic fat ( liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio: β ± SE = -0.83 ± 0.42 , P = 0.05). Our findings suggest that a `` Western/nonvegetarian '' dietary pattern is associated with a metabolomic profile that is related to an adverse cardiometabolic profile in Asian Indians. Public health efforts to reduce cardiometabolic disease burden in this high-risk group should focus on consuming a healthy plant-based diet.
