  The 21-gene recurrence score ( RS) is a RT-PCR assay estimating risk of distant recurrence in estrogen receptor positive ( ER +) , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative ( HER2) breast cancer ( BC). Studies validating RS are limited to women. Our objective was to assess RS distribution and factors associated with high-risk RS in male BC. Using the Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results database , we identified men and women with ER +/ HER2- BC from 2010 to 2013. Patients were categorized into risk groups using the traditional and the Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment ( TAILORx) cutoffs. Multivariable logistic regression determined factors associated with testing and high-risk TAILORx RS. We identified 1388 men and 154,196 women with ER +/ HER2- BC. Twenty-five percent of men and 30 % of women had RS testing. Mean age of tested men was 63; most were white ( 81 %) , had grade I or II tumors ( 67 %) , and had stage I or II ( 95 %) BC. Factors associated with increased RS testing were younger age , recent year of diagnosis , lymph node negativity , and lower-stage tumors ( p ≤ 0.05). By TAILORx , 21 % of men had high-risk RS compared with 14 % of tested women. Men with grade III and PR negative tumors were more likely to have a high-risk RS ( p ≤ 0.05). Chemotherapy utilization was correlated with RS. Using a large population-based dataset , we found that compared with women , men were significantly more likely to have high-risk RS. Grade III and PR-negative BC were significantly associated with high-risk RS. Higher RS in men correlated with increased chemotherapy utilization.
