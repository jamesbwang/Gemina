  Microextraction techniques are widely applied for sample preparation to gas chromatographic analysis of target compounds in samples with a complex matrix. Recently , needle-based microextraction techniques have been developed in order to improve performance of the extraction. The main advantages of these techniques are miniaturization , automation , high performance , environmentally friendliness and on-line coupling with analytical instruments. This review focuses on the three needle-based microextraction techniques including solid-phase dynamic extraction ( SPDE) , in-tube extraction ( ITEX) and needle trap device extraction ( NTD). The core of the aforementioned techniques is an extraction phase protected in the stainless steel needle. The application of the sorbent-protected needle extraction techniques for the gas chromatographic analysis of environmental , biological and food samples is discussed. The fundamental aspects and development over the years are also summarized.
