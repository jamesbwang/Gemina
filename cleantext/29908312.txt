  Optical studies of ex vivo brain slices where blood is absent show that neural activity is accompanied by significant intrinsic optical signals ( IOS) related to activity-dependent scattering changes in neural tissue. However , the neural scattering signals have been largely ignored in vivo in widely-used IOS methods where absorption contrast from hemoglobin was employed. Changes in scattering were observed on a time scale of seconds in previous brain slice IOS studies , similar to the time scale for the hemodynamic response. Therefore , potential crosstalk between the scattering and absorption changes may not be ignored if they have comparable contributions to IOS. In vivo , the IOS changes linked to neural scattering have been elusive. To isolate neural scattering signals in vivo , we employed 2 implantable optodes for small-separation ( 2 mm) transmission measurements of local brain tissue in anesthetized rats. This unique geometry enables us to separate neuronal activity-related changes in neural tissue scattering from changes in blood absorption based upon the direction of the signal change. The changes in IOS scattering and absorption in response to up-states of spontaneous neuronal activity in cortical or subcortical structures have strong correlation to local field potentials , but significantly different response latencies. We conclude that activity-dependent neural tissue scattering in vivo may be an additional source of contrast for functional brain studies that provides complementary information to other optical or MR-based systems that are sensitive to hemodynamic contrast.
