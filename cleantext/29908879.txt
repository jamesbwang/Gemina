  Melatonin is a physiological indoleamine involved in circadian rhythm regulation and it is currently used for secondary sleep disorders supported by empirical evidence. A small amount of evidence and some controversial results have been obtained in some randomized controlled trials ( RCT). The objective of this meta-analysis is to determine the efficacy of exogenous melatonin versus placebo in managing secondary sleep disorders. Literature retrieval of eligible RCT was performed in 5 databases ( PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Library , ClinicalTrials.gov , and Web of Science). In total , 7 studies of 205 patients were included. Pooled data demonstrate that exogenous melatonin lowers sleep onset latency and increases total sleep time , whereas it has little if any effect on sleep efficiency. Although , the efficacy of melatonin still requires further confirmation , this meta-analysis clearly supports the use of melatonin as a management for patients with secondary sleep disorders.
