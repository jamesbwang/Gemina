  The growth hormone ( GH)/ insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1) axis has a fundamental impact on glucose metabolism. Therefore , both untreated GH deficiency ( GHD) and GH treatment ( GHT) may be associated with some metabolic alterations , although the abnormalities of glucose metabolism have been investigated by relatively few studies as main outcomes. The present review summarizes the available data on glucose metabolism in children with GHD , providing an overview of the current state of the art in order to better clarify the real metabolic impact of GHD and GHT. Among all the existing studies , we evaluated all original studies that fulfilled our criteria for analysis reporting parameters of glucose metabolism as the primary or secondary objective. The reported impact of GHD The different methods to study glucose metabolism , the heterogeneity of the populations evaluated , the different doses of GH used together with the variable duration of follow-up may be responsible for discrepancy in the results. Long-term longitudinal studies having glucose homeostasis as their primary outcome are still needed in order better to clarify the real metabolic impact of GHD and GHT in children.
