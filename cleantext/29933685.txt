  Alisol A 24-acetate , a triterpenoid extracted from Alisma orientale , has shown anti-atherosclerotic actions and many studies have proved that oxidized low density lipoprotein ( Ox-LDL) could promote proliferation of aorta smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs) which are closely related to atherosclerosis ( AS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of alisol A 24-acetate on the proliferation of VSMCs isolated from the thoracic aorta of rats induced by ox-LDL. VSMCs were induced by ox-LDL ( 50 mg · L ⁻¹) to establish the proliferation model and intervened by alisol A 24-acetate ( 5 , 10 , 20 mg · L ⁻¹) for 12 , 24 and 48 h. Then the proliferation of VSMCs was detected by MTT assay; protein expression levels of VSMCs PCNA , cyclinD1 , cyclinE , p21 , p27 and VSMCs PCNA , p21and p27 mRNA expression levels were detected by Western blot and Real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) respectively. The results showed that ox-LDL could induce the proliferation of VSMCs (
