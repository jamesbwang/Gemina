  Recent press coverage on vaginal mesh surgery has resulted in a change in how patients are counselled , managed and treated in the UK. For stress urinary incontinence surgical procedures such as insertion of tension-free vaginal tape are commonplace and generally performed as a day-case procedure. Effective and successful management of female urinary incontinence is difficult , even when using diagnostic testing where all conservative managements have failed , and this indicates a need to investigate further. Specialist texts in the fields of urology and urogynaecology argue that urodynamics can help inform the success of surgical intervention for stress urinary incontinence. The aim of this review was to look for evidence of practice where urodynamic findings are used to determine the successful outcome of mid-urethral sling surgery in females. A literature search to identify research on this topic was performed with appraisal of qualifying literature. The qualifying research included attitudes towards urodynamic studies among urogynaecologists and urologists , demonstration that urodynamics has been proven to influence changes in diagnosis and surgical approaches , and the capacity for urodynamics to predict successful outcomes in mid-urethral sling surgery. Analysis of the literature found no evidence to suggest that urodynamic findings can be used to determine successful outcomes following mid-urethral sling surgery.
