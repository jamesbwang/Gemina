  Approximately 25 % of breast cancer patients experience treatment delays or discontinuation due to paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy ( PN). Currently , there are no predictive biomarkers of PN. Pharmacometabolomics is an informative tool for biomarker discovery of drug toxicity. We conducted a secondary whole blood pharmacometabolomics analysis to assess the association between pretreatment metabolome , early treatment-induced metabolic changes , and the development of PN. Whole blood samples were collected pre-treatment ( BL) , just before the end of the first paclitaxel infusion ( EOI) , and 24 h after the first infusion ( 24H) from sixty patients with breast cancer receiving ( 80 mg/m Pretreatment histidine , phenylalanine , and threonine concentrations were inversely associated with maximum change in CIPN8 ( ΔCIPN8) ( p < 0.02; FDR ≤ 25 %). Paclitaxel caused a significant change in concentrations of 2-hydroxybutyrate , 3-hydroxybutyrate , pyruvate , o-acetylcarnitine , and several amino acids from BL to EOI and/or 24H ( p < 0.05; FDR ≤ 25 %) , although these changes were not associated with ΔCIPN8. Whole blood metabolomics is a feasible approach to identify potential biomarker candidates of paclitaxel-induced PN. The findings suggest that pretreatment concentrations of histidine , phenylalanine , and threonine may be predictive of the severity of future PN and paclitaxel-induced metabolic changes may be related to disruption of energy homeostasis.
