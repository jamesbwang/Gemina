  Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2) is a multi-domain protein and its mutations can lead to Parkinson 's disease. Recent studies on LRRK2 and homologue proteins have advanced our mechanistic understanding of LRRK2 regulation. Here , we summarize the available data on the biochemistry and structure of LRRK2 and postulate three possible layers of regulation , translocation , monomer-dimer equilibrium and intramolecular activation of domains.
