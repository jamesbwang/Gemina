  The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of lower protein ( LP) versus higher protein ( HP) content in infant formula on body composition from 3 months to 6 years. In a multicenter , double-blind European trial , healthy infants ( N = 1,090) were randomly assigned to different protein content formulas ( upper ( HP) and lower ( LP) limits of the European Union regulations in 2001) during the first year; breastfed infants ( N = 588) were recruited for reference values. Weight , height , and triceps and subscapular skinfold ( SF) thickness were measured repeatedly ( N = 650 at 6 years) , and body composition was estimated ( Slaughter). The 99th percentile of fat mass index reference data were used to assess excess<symptom> body fat at 6 years. At 2 and 6 years , the study observed greater sum of SFs ( Δ 2 years: 0.5 mm , P = 0.026 , Δ 6 years: 0.6 mm , P = 0.045) , fat mass index ( Δ 2 years: 0.12 kg/m ² , P = 0.008 , Δ 6 years: 0.15 kg/m ² , P = 0.011) , and fat-free mass index ( Δ 2 years: 0.17 kg/m ² , P = 0.003 , Δ 6 years: 0.18 kg/m ² , P = 0.010) in the HP group compared with the LP group. At 6 years , the HP group had a twofold higher risk than the LP group for excess<symptom> body fat ( adjusted odds ratio: 2.13 , P = 0.019). Infant formula with HP levels induced greater fat mass in children from 2 to 6 years. Lowering the protein content of infant formula may result in a healthier body composition in early childhood.
