  Tissue engineering requires large numbers of cells with enhanced differentiation properties. Thus , the effect of expansion conditions must be explored. Human and rat marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs and rMSCs , respectively) were comparatively culture-expanded through 7 passages in the presence of either fibroblast growth factor-2 ( FGF-2) or platelet-derived growth factor BB ( PDGF-BB). Proliferation of both hMSCs and rMSCs was enhanced by FGF-2 and PDGF-BB. Population doubling times for hMSCs were 2.4 days for control and 1.75 and 2.0 days for FGF-2 and PDGF-BB , respectively. And 3.25 , 3.06 , and 2.95 days for rMSCs. Supplementation with FGF-2 during cell expansion resulted in significantly greater in vivo bone formation for hMSCs. Use of PDGF-BB resulted in greater bone formation than that observed for control conditions , but the differences were only significant for P1. For rMSCs , significant increases in bone formation were noted in either FGF-2 or PDGF-BB expanded cells implanted at P4 or P7 , but not for P1. Under in vitro osteogenic stimulation , calcium content was elevated and bone matrix deposition was enhanced for P1 and P7 rMSCs expanded with FGF-2. Although culture conditions , including FBS , were held constant , these observations suggest that medium must be optimized separately for each species of MSCs.
