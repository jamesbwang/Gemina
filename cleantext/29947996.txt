  To examine different locations and laser settings ' effects on the efficiency of the `` popcorn '' method of laser lithotripsy , which consists of placing the laser in a group of small stones and firing continuously to break them into smaller particles. Pre-fragmented BegoStones were created between 2 and 4 mm to mimic typical popcorning conditions. A 0.5 g collection of fragments was placed into 3D-printed models ( a spherical calyx and ellipsoid pelvis model) and a 200-µm laser fiber was positioned above the stones. The laser was fired for 2 min with irrigation , with 5 trials at each setting: 0.2 J/50 Hz , 0.5 J/20 Hz , 0.5 J/40 Hz , 1 J/20 Hz , 0.2 J/80 Hz , 0.5 J/80 Hz. After drying , fragmentation efficiency was determined by calculating the mass of stones reduced to sub-2 mm particles. Statistical analysis was performed with ANOVA and Student 's t test. The trials within the calyx model were significantly more efficient compared to the pelvis ( 0.19 vs 0.15 g , p = 0.01). When comparing laser settings , there was a difference between groups by one-way ANOVA ( F ( 5,54) = 8.503 , p = 5.47 × 10
