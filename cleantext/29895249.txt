  Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is the most common cause of dementia , characterized by a progressive decline in cognition and function. Current treatment options for AD include the cholinesterase inhibitors ( ChEIs) donepezil , galantamine , and rivastigmine , as well as the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine. Treatment guidelines recommend the use of ChEIs as standard of care first-line therapy. Several randomized clinical studies have demonstrated the benefits of ChEIs on cognition , global function , behavior and activities of daily living. However , patients may fail to achieve sustained clinical benefits from ChEIs due to lack/loss of efficacy and/or safety , tolerability issues , and poor adherence to the treatment. The purpose of this review is to explore the strategies for continued successful treatment in patients with AD. Literature search was performed for articles published in PubMed and MEDLINE , using pre-specified search terms. Articles were critically evaluated for inclusion based on their titles , abstracts , and full text of the publication. The findings of this review indicate that dose up-titration and switching between ChEIs may help to improve response to ChEI<disease> treatment and also address issue such as lack/loss of efficacy or safety/tolerability in patients with AD. However , well-designed studies are needed to provide robust evidences.
