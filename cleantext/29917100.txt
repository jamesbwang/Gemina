  The role of inflammation<symptom> in OA is controversial and it is unclear whether suppressing inflammation<symptom> with conventional or biologic DMARDs is effective. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) was conducted to compare DMARDs with placebo in participants with symptomatic OA. Databases ( Medline , Embase , Allied and Complementary Medicine Database , Web of Science and Cochrane Library) , conference abstracts and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to end of November 2017 for placebo-controlled RCTs of DMARDs , including biologics , in symptomatic OA. Pain data at treatment peak time point were extracted and combined using a random-effects meta-analysis. Markers of inflammation<symptom> and adverse events were extracted and reviewed. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using Cochrane 's tool. Eleven RCTs ( 1205 participants) were meta-analysed , including six for conventional DMARDs ( 757 participants) and five for biologics ( 448 participants). Overall , DMARDs were statistically superior to placebo ( effect size ( ES) = 0.18 , 95 % CI: 0.03 , 0.34) , although the difference was not clinically significant ( 0.5 ES threshold). Furthermore , no statistically significant differences were observed in sub-analysis of high-quality trials ( ES = 0.11 , 95 % CI: -0.06 , 0.28) , biologics ( ES = 0.16 , 95 % CI: -0.02 , 0.34) or conventional DMARDs ( ES = 0.24 , 95 % CI: -0.05 , 0.54). No difference was found between erosive vs non-erosive hand OA , hand vs knee OA or anti-IL1 vs anti-TNF biologics. DMARDs did not offer clinically significant pain relief above placebo in OA. This poor efficacy indicates that inflammation<symptom> may not be a prime driver for OA pain.
