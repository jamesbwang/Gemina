  Impacts from oil exploration , development and production in the Beaufort Sea , Alaska , are assessed using concentrations of metals in sediments collected during 2014-15 , combined with a large dataset for 1985-2006. Concentrations of 7 ( 1980 s) or 17 ( 1999-2015) metals in 423 surface sediments from 134 stations , plus 563 samples from 30 cores were highly variable , primarily as a function of sediment granulometry with naturally greater metal concentrations in fine-grained , Al-rich sediment. Metals versus Al correlation plots were used to normalize metal concentrations and identify values significantly above background. Barium , Cr , Cu , Hg and Pb concentrations were above background , but variable , within 250 m of some offshore sites where drilling occurred between 1981-2001; these areas totaled < 6 km
