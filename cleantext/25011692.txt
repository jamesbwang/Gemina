  A combination of safety concerns and labeling changes impacted use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs) in renal<symptom> anemia<symptom>. Data regarding contemporary utilization in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease ( CKD) are lacking. Electronic healthcare records and medical claims data of pre-dialysis CKD patients were aggregated from a large US managed care provider ( 2011-13). ESA use patterns , characteristics , and outcomes of ESA-treated/untreated patients were quantified. At baseline , 109/32 ,308 patients ( 0.3 %) were ESA users. Treated patients were older , had more advanced CKD ( 58.8 % vs 5.4 % with stage 4/5 vs 3) and greater prevalence of comorbid diabetes , hypertension , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , and peripheral vascular disease. An additional 266 patients initiated ESA: hemoglobin at initiation was 8-10 g/dL in 193 of these and > 10 g/dL in the remainder; 61.7 % had stage 4/5 CKD; prevalence of cardiovascular disease was high ( 50.8 % heart<symptom> failure<symptom>; 25.2 % prior myocardial infarction; 24.1 % prior stroke). During follow-up , rates of death and cardiovascular events were higher in baseline ESA users and ESA naives versus non-users. ESA use in pre-dialysis CKD patients was exceedingly rare and directed disproportionately to older , sicker patients; these patients had high rates of death and cardiovascular events. These data provide context for contemporary use of ESA in pre-dialysis CKD.
