  Monodisperse stone-like PtNi alloy nanoparticles ( NPs) were synthesized at room temperature using an inverse microemulsion method. The results of XRD , HRTEM , and EDS demonstrate that these NPs consist of a disordered alloy that has ( a) a face-centered cubic structure , ( b) Pt/Ni atomic ratios of ∼ 5:1 , and ( c) a large number of atoms exposed on the NP surface and enclosed by low index facets. The material was placed on a glassy electrode which then displayed superior response to glucose. Best operated at a potential of 0.43 V ( vs. SCE) , the electrode has the following features: ( a) a wide linear range ( from 0.5 mM to 40 mM) , ( b) rapid response ( < 1 s) , ( c) a low detection limit ( 0.35 μM) and ( d) a sensitivity of 40.17 μA mM
