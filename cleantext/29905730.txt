  The image of the photonic jet ( also called caustic) formed by a large , transparent , and spherical particle , reconstructed by digital in-line holography , is shown to be similar to the Airy pattern observed at the focus of a diffraction-limited lens. The analysis of this image , real or virtual depending on whether the particle relative refractive index is above or below one , allows characterizing the particle composition via its refractive index. Experiments clearly demonstrate the value of this method for the simultaneous 3D characterization and differentiation of the dynamics , size , and composition of gas , liquid , and solid particles in multiphase flows.
