  SENIOR compared the efficacy and safety of insulin glargine 300 units/mL ( Gla-300) with glargine 100 units/mL ( Gla-100) in older people ( ≥ 65 years old) with type 2 diabetes. SENIOR was an open-label , two-arm , parallel-group , multicenter phase 3b trial designed to enroll ∼ 20 % of participants aged ≥ 75 years. Participants were randomized 1:1 to Gla-300 or Gla-100 , titrated to a fasting self-monitored plasma glucose of 5.0-7.2 mmol/L ( 90-130 mg/dL). In total , 1,014 participants were randomized ( mean age: 71 years). Comparable reductions in HbA Efficacy and safety of Gla-300 was demonstrated in older people ( ≥ 65 years of age) with type 2 diabetes , with comparable reductions in HbA
