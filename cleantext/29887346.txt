  Eighteen loci and several susceptibility genes have been related to Parkinson 's disease ( PD). However , most studies focus on single genes in small PD series. Our aim was to establish the genetic background of a large Spanish PD sample. Pooled-DNA target sequencing of 7 major PD genes ( SNCA , PARK2 , PINK1 , DJ-1 , LRRK2 , GBA , and MAPT) was performed in 562 PD cases. Forty-four variants were found among 114 individuals ( 20.28 % , p < 0.05). Among these variants , 30 were found in Mendelian genes ( 68.18 %) and 14 in PD susceptibility genes ( 31.82 %). Seven novel variants were identified. Interestingly , most variants were found in PARK2 and PINK1 genes , whereas SNCA and DJ-1 variants were rare. Validated variants were also genotyped in Spanish healthy controls ( n = 597). Carriers of heterozygous PARK2 variants presented earlier disease onset and showed dementia more frequently. PD subjects carrying 2 variants at different genes ( 1.42 %) had an earlier age of onset and a predominantly akinetic-rigid PD phenotype ( 55.6 % , p < 0.05) , suggesting that the accumulation of genetic risk variants could modify PD phenotype.
