  Lung cancer remains the most common cause of tumor-related death worldwide. Recent studies have revealed that long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) are involved in the development of various cancers , including lung cancer. This study aimed to investigate the effect and the molecular basis of lncRNA PICART1 on lung cancer. We first assessed the PICART1 expression in lung cancer in vitro and vivo by qRT-PCR. Then the expression of PICART1 in SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1975 cell lines was inhibited and overexpressed by transient transfections. Thereafter , cell viability , cell cycle , migration and apoptosis were respectively measured by MTT , Transwell and flow cytometry assay. Furthermore , qRT-PCR and western blot analysis were mainly performed to assess the expression levels of apoptosis- and migration-related proteins and JAK2/STAT3 pathway proteins. Tumor formation was measured by xenograft tumor model assay in vivo. PICART1 expression was down-regulated in human lung cancer tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of PICART1 increased cell viability of lung cancer cell lines. However , PICART1 overexpression inhibited cell cycle progression and promoted apoptosis in SPC-A-1 and NCI-H1975 cell lines. PICART1 overexpression also inhibited migration , as evidenced by up-regulation of E-cadherin , and down-regulation of Twist1 , MMP2 and MMP9. Furthermore , we found PICART1 inhibition may regulate cell apoptosis and migration through activating JAK2/STAT3 pathway. In vivo experiments revealed that PICART1 knockdown significantly promoted tumor formation.This study demonstrates that PICART1 overexpression represents an anti-growth and anti-metastasis role in lung cancer cells. Additionally , PICART1 acts as a tumor suppressor may be via regulation of JAK2/STAT3 pathway.
