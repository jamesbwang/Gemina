  Acrylamide ( ACR) is a hazardous substance associated with the accumulation of excessive reactive oxygen species and causes oxidative stress. Presence of ACR in foods leads to public health concerns due to its known neurotoxic , genotoxic , and carcinogenic effects. The present study investigated the ameliorative effects of boron ( B) against ACR exposed rats. Forty Wistar albino male rats , fed with low-boron diet , were randomly and equally allocated into 5 groups. The control group was orally treated with physiological saline as placebo , the second group was orally given 15 mg/kg ACR. The other groups were orally treated with 15 mg/kg ACR and B at the levels of 5 , 10 , and 20 mg/kg/day for 60 days , respectively. ACR-treatment significantly increased malondialdehyde levels whereas decreased glutathione levels in rat tissues. Also , ACR-treatment increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in erythrocytes and tissues. Meanwhile , mRNA expression levels of NFĸB , IFN-γ , IL-1β , and TNF-α in liver and brain of rats were increased under ACR treatment. Additionally , ACR caused a significant decrease in the level of high-density lipoprotein , with increase in the levels of low-density lipoprotein , triglyceride , cholesterol , glucose , urea nitrogen , and creatinine. Lastly , B alleviated histopathological alterations induced by ACR in rat tissues.
