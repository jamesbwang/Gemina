  Sexual mating of compatible sporida is essential for Sporisorium scitamineum to form dikaryotic mycelia and then cause infection on sugarcane. Our previous work identified a Pseudomonas<pathogen> sp.. ST4 from a soil sample , which showed a promising biocontrol potential by inhibiting the mating of S. scitamineum sporida and hyphal growth. In this study , we set to isolate the active compounds from Pseudomonas<pathogen> sp.. ST4 through solid fermentation. High-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) separation coupling with bioassay showed that Pseudomonas<pathogen> sp.. ST4 produced a range of antimicrobial compounds. Two of the major components were purified following acetate extraction , silica gel and HPLC separation. Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ( LC-MS) analysis identified these active compounds are 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and indole-3-carbaldehyde respectively. Further analysis showed that the former compound only inhibited the hyphal growth of the fungus at a concentration of 3 mM , while the latter interfered the fungal sexual mating at a concentration of 0.6 mM and affected hyphal growth at a concentration of 2 mM. Treatment of corn plants with 3 mM indole-3-carbaldehyde significantly inhibited corn smut infection , with a control rate up to 94 %. Further analysis of the structure and activity relationship revealed that indole has a much stronger inhibitory activity against the fungal sexual mating than indole-3-carbaldehyde. The results from this study provide new agents for control and prevention of the sugarcane smut disease , and the active compounds could also be used to probe the molecular mechanisms of fungal sexual mating.
