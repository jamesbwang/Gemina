  Coral reefs sustain abundant and diverse macrocrustaceans that perform multiple ecological roles , but coral reefs are undergoing massive degradation that may be driving changes in the species composition and abundance of reef-associated macrocrustaceans. To provide insight into this issue , we used non-destructive visual census techniques to compare the diversity and abundance of conspicuous macrocrustaceans ( i.e. , those > 1 cm and visible without disturbance) between two shallow Caribbean coral reefs similar in size ( âˆ¼ 1.5 km in length) and close to each other , but one ( `` Limones '') characterized by extensive stands of the branching coral
