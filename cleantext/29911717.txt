  An Au-Cu bimetallic nanocluster co-capped by selenolate and phosphine is obtained and its X-ray structure shows an icosahedral Au13 kernel surrounded by three CuSe2PPh2Py motifs and one CuSe3 motif , formulated as ( Au13Cu4 ( PPh2Py) 3 ( SePh) 9). Interestingly , a single-ligand exchange process is observed in the growth reaction , in which an ( Au13Cu4 ( PPh2Py) 4 ( SePh) 8) + intermediate is first formed , but a prolonged reaction leads to one PPh2Py ligand being selectively replaced by a PhSe-ligand. DFT simulations reveal that both steric hindrance and bond dissociation energy have great effects on the single-ligand exchange reaction as well as the thermodynamics , which help to understand the mechanism of the ligand exchange. Temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence ( PL) properties of the Au-Cu nanocluster imply that the optical properties are mainly contributed by the metal core. Femtosecond time-resolved pump-probe analysis maps out further details of the PL process.
