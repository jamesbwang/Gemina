  Two monoterpenoid indole alkaloid erchinines A ( 1) and B ( 2) , possessing unique 1,4-diazepine fused with oxazolidine architecture and three hemiaminals , were isolated from Ervatamia chinensis. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of intensive spectroscopic analysis , and a plausible biosynthetic pathway from ibogaine was proposed. Both compounds exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against Trichophyton<pathogen> rubrum<pathogen> and Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> , and their activities were comparable to the first line antifungal drug griseofulvin and antibiotic cefotaxime.
