  The aim of the study was to estimate and compare aspartate aminotransferases ( AST) and alanine aminotransferases ( ALT) levels in saliva and serum of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ( IDDM) and normal children , and the objective was to evaluate the significance of these enzymes in assessing the salivary gland injury in IDDM children. The study group comprised of thirty children clinically and biochemically diagnosed for IDDM and thirty healthy children of similar age in the control group. Saliva and serum samples were collected and enzyme assay was performed by optimized ultraviolet test method ( according to International Federation of Clinical Chemistry). The values obtained were subjected to statistical analysis using Mann-Whitney U-test for comparison of the variables and Karl-Pearson 's coefficient test for correlation. The SPSS 16.0 , ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , USA) was used for statistical analysis. Higher values of AST ( mean = saliva 91.60 IU/L) and ALT ( mean = saliva 94.93 IU/L) were found in the saliva than in serum ( AST serum = 15.83 IU/L) ( ALT serum = 20.80 IU/L) among the patients and the differences were statistically highly significant ( Elevated salivary AST and ALT levels in IDDM patients suggest the injury to salivary glands and could aid as a salivary marker for the involvement of salivary glands in IDDM.
