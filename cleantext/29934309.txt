  Human tissue kallikrein ( KLK) proteases are hormone-like signaling molecules with important functions in cancer pathophysiology. KLK-related peptidase 6 ( KLK6) , specifically , is highly up-regulated in several types of cancer , where its increased activity promotes cancer invasion and metastasis. This characteristic suggests KLK6 as an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. However , inhibitors that specifically target KLK6 have not yet been reported , possibly because KLK6 shares a high sequence homology and structural similarity with other serine proteases and resists inhibition by many polypeptide inhibitors. Here , we present an innovative combinatorial approach to engineering KLK6 inhibitors via flow cytometry-based screening of a yeast-displayed mutant library of the human amyloid precursor protein Kunitz protease inhibitor domain ( APPI) , an inhibitor of other serine proteases , such as anionic and cationic trypsins. On the basis of this screening , we generated APPIM17L , I18F , S19F , F34V ( APPI-4M) , an APPI variant with a KLK6 inhibition constant ( Ki) of 160 pM and a turnover time of 10 days. To the best of our knowledge , APPI-4M is the most potent KLK6 inhibitor reported to date , displaying 146-fold improved affinity and 13-fold improved proteolytic stability compared with wild-type APPI ( APPIWT). We further demonstrate that APPI-4M acts as a functional inhibitor in a cell-based model of KLK6-dependent breast cancer invasion. Finally , the crystal structures of the APPIWT/KLK6 and APPI-4M/ KLK6 complexes revealed the structural and mechanistic bases for the improved KLK6 binding and proteolytic resistance of APPI-4M. We anticipate that APPI-4M will have substantial translational potential as both imaging agent and therapeutic.
