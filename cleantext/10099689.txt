  To understand the transcriptional response of antioxidant defense system and heat shock<symptom> protein ( Hsp) families of the marine ciliate Euplotes crassus , we analyzed the transcriptome profile using RNA-seq technology after exposure to cadmium ( Cd) and copper ( Cu). De novo sequence assembly produced 61,240 unigenes with 21,330 BLAST hits and showed high sequence orthology with transcriptomes of other ciliates. Gene annotation and gene ontology ( GO) comparison revealed that E. crassus expressed highly diversified but conserved stress-responsive gene families of the antioxidant defense system and Hsps. After waterborne exposure to 250 μg/L of Cd and 25 μg/L of Cu , transcriptional responses of the gene families were significantly modulated , suggesting that even the unicellular E. crassus has a conserved molecular defense mechanism , such as modulating mRNA expression , for homeostasis. These transcriptional responses make E. crassus a potential model for understanding the molecular response of single cell ciliates to heavy metal contamination.
