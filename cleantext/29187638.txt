  Melatonin is a potential therapeutic agent for endometriosis , but its molecular mechanism is unclear. Here , we investigated the effect of melatonin on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) in endometriotic endometrial epithelial cells and explored the pathway that might be involved. This hospital-based study included 60 women of reproductive age using the endometrium for immunohistochemistry , 6 women of reproductive age undergoing bilateral tubal ligation and 6 patients with endometriosis for isolation of endometrial epithelial cells or subsequent analysis , respectively. We examined the expression of Notch1/Numb signaling and EMT markers by immunohistochemistry analysis and western blot analysis , the invasion and migration of endometrial epithelial cells by transwell assays , and the cell proliferation by CCK8 assays. Compared with normal endometrium , the endometriotic eutopic endometrium showed increased expression of Notch1 , Slug , Snail , and N-cadherin , and decreased expression of E-cadherin and Numb. Melatonin or Notch inhibition by specific inhibitor blocked 17β-estradiol-induced cell proliferation , invasion , migration and EMT-related markers in both normal and endometriotic epithelial cells. Our data suggest that aberrant expression of Notch1/Numb signaling and the EMT is present in endometriotic endometrium. Melatonin may block 17β-estradiol-induced migration , invasion and EMT in normal and endometriotic epithelial cells by upregulating Numb expression and decreasing the activity of the Notch signaling pathway.
