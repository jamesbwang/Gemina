  This work analyses the meal supply in primary schools in Italy to highlight new areas of inefficiency upstream of the food chain , regarding the size of the food portions specified in public tenders. A lack of conformity of food portions can potentially lead to a double negative externality affecting the sustainability of school meals: overweight children and food waste. Based on the data contained in the contract between municipalities and school catering services , the analysis was performed on the portion sizes ( in grams) of the main food products included in the school menu for each regional capital ( RC) in Italy. Data analysis regarded two main aspects: consistency of food portions within regions and adherence to national standards for childrens. The results revealed great discrepancies amongst regions and in several cases , portion sizes significantly larger than the reference values of standard portions for school catering. The study also profiles RC on the basis of portion sizes , school meal attendance , and childhood obesity rates. School meals have the potential to educate the next generation regarding healthy eating habits , and thus play a leading role in obesity prevention in children. Similarly , the educational role of eating at school can contribute to raising children 's awareness about one of the most urgent environmental challenges-food waste-by introducing the best strategies for waste reduction , reuse , and recycling. Results have economic , social , health , and environmental implications and highlight the need to revisit policies to introduce new solutions for more sustainable and healthy school canteens in Italy.
