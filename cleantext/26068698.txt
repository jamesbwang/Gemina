  Whole-genome sequencing unveiled host and environment-related insights to Shigella<pathogen> sonnei<pathogen> transmission within cyclic epidemics during 2000-2012 in Israel. The Israeli reservoir contains isolates belonging to S.<pathogen> sonnei<pathogen> lineage III but of different origin , shows loss of tetracycline resistance genes , and little genetic variation within the O antigen: highly relevant for Shigella<pathogen> vaccine development.
