  This article reviews the conceptual framework , available evidence , and practical considerations pertaining to nascent and emerging advances in patient-centered CT-imaging and CT-guided surgery for maxillofacial trauma. These include cinematic rendering-a novel method for advanced 3D visualization , incorporation of quantitative CT imaging into the assessment of orbital fractures , low-dose CT imaging protocols made possible with contemporary scanners and reconstruction techniques , the rapidly growing use of cone-beam CT , virtual fracture reduction with design software for surgical pre-planning , the use of 3D printing for fabricating models and implants , and new avenues in CT-guided computer-aided surgery.
