  In this preliminary study , we examined whether aspects of spiritual well-being accounted for mental and physical health-related quality of life in 68 patients with end-stage renal disease , when controlling for age , type of treatment , physical symptoms , and worries. Hierarchical multiple regressions showed that meaning was associated with better mental health , while worry and physical symptoms also accounted for poor mental health. Faith and peace did not contribute to mental health. Older age , type of treatment ( hemodialysis) , and physical symptoms accounted for poor physical health. Our findings suggest that clinicians should include spiritual well-being in future interventions for end-stage renal disease patients.
