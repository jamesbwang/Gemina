  The health status of segregated Roma is poor. To understand why segregated Roma engage in health-endangering practices , we explored their nonadherence to clinical and public health recommendations. We examined one segregated Roma settlement of 260 inhabitants in Slovakia. To obtain qualitative data on local-level mechanisms supporting Roma nonadherence , we combined ethnography and systematic interviewing over 10 years. We then performed a qualitative content analysis based on sociological and public health theories. Our explanatory framework summarizes how the nonadherence of local Roma was supported by an interlocked system of seven mechanisms , controlled by and operating through both local Roma and non-Roma. These regard the Roma situation of poverty , segregation and substandard infrastructure; the Roma socialization into their situation; the Roma-perceived value of Roma alternative practices; the exclusionary non-Roma and self-exclusionary Roma ideologies; the discrimination , racism and dysfunctional support towards Roma by non-Roma; and drawbacks in adherence. Non-Roma ideologies , internalized by Roma into a racialized ethnic identity through socialization , and drawbacks in adherence might present powerful , yet neglected , mechanisms supporting segregated Roma nonadherence.
