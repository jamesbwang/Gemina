  The current gold-standard diagnosis method for avian influenza<disease> ( AI) is an embryonic egg-based hemagglutination assay followed by immunoblotting or PCR sequencing to confirm subtypes. It requires , however , specialized facilities to handle egg inoculation and incubation , and the subtyping methods relied on costly reagents. Now , the first differential sensing approach to distinguish AI subtypes is demonstrated using series of cell lines and a fluorescent sensor. Susceptibility of AI virus differs depending on genetic backgrounds of host cells. Cells were examined from different organ origins , and the infection patterns against a panel of cells were utilized for AI virus subtyping. To quantify AI infection , a highly cell-permeable fluorescent superoxide sensor was designed to visualize infection. This differential sensing strategy successfully proved discriminations of AI subtypes and demonstrated as a useful primary screening platform to monitor a large number of samples.
