  We describe the technique of second-wave hydrodissection ( the first wave being the initial cortical cleaving hydrodissection) performed after the removal of the cataract nucleus in femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery. After femtosecond laser application , the cortex is typically found adhered to the anterior capsule. Under high magnification , a steady stream of a balanced salt solution is directed toward the anterior capsule using a hydrodissection cannula. Full cleavage of the remaining cortex is observed by noting the appearance of a dark inner circle by the capsulotomy edge once the balanced salt solution wave has separated the cortex from the capsule. Irrigation/aspiration ( I/A) of the cortical remains after the second wave is faster than I/A without this step in femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery.
