  Ischemic stroke in patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The growing epidemic of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> worldwide has raised concerns about the dire need for effective stroke prevention systems in these patients. Fortunately , the last decade has witnessed a plethora of data on novel stroke prevention methods in patients with nonvalvular atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. However , optimal selection and effective implementation of these preventative strategies require an integrative approach that takes into account not only the available clinical data but also the perspective of each of the stakeholders involved ( patient , physician , and society). The goal of this review was to discuss the contemporary issues surrounding stroke prevention in atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> from the perspective of these 3 major stakeholders.
