  Current imaging technologies are capable of acquiring volumetric data , but they are limited by the flat 2-dimensional representation of complex 3-dimensional data. This pictorial report illustrates the potential role of interactive virtual reality ( VR) that enables physicians to visualize and interact with image data as if they were real physical objects. Increasing availability of tools that make the VR environment a possibility could potentially be valuable in the interventional radiology suite.
