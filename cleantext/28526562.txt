  Antileukoproteinase or secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor is a small protein which protects the mucosal linings against excessive proteolysis , inflammation<symptom> , and microbial infection. We discovered that gelatinase B or matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP) -9 , a secreted zinc-dependent endopeptidase typically found at sites of inflammation<symptom> , destroys antileukoproteinase by cleavages within both of its two functional domains: the anti-microbial N-terminal and the anti-proteolytic C-terminal domains. Cleaved antileukoproteinase possessed a significantly lower ability to bind lipopolysaccharides ( LPS) and a reduced capacity to inhibit neutrophil elastase ( NE) activity. Whereas intact antileukoproteinase repressed proinflammatory transcript ( prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (
