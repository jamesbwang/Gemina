  We study the analytical structure of the effective action for spin- and mass-imbalanced Fermi mixtures at the onset of the superfluid state. Of our particular focus is the possibility of suppressing the tricritical temperature to zero , so that the transition remains continuous down to T = 0 and the phase diagram hosts a quantum critical point. At mean-field level we analytically identify such a possibility in a regime of parameters in dimensionality d = 3. In contrast , in d = 2 we demonstrate that the occurrence of a quantum critical point is ( at the mean-field level) excluded. We show that the Landau expansion of the effective potential remains well-defined in the limit ( Formula: see text) except for a subset of model parameters which includes the standard BCS limit. We calculate the mean-field asymptotic shape of the transition line. Employing the functional renormalization group framework we go beyond the mean field theory and demonstrate the stability of the quantum critical point in d = 3 with respect to fluctuations.
