  To evaluate 3-year incidence of Nd: YAG capsulotomy and PCO and compare the effect of different IOL materials. Data were retrospectively collected from seven UK ophthalmology clinics using Medisoft electronic medical records. Eyes from patients â‰¥ 65 years undergoing cataract surgery with implantation of acrylic monofocal IOLs during 2010-2013 and 3-year follow-up were analysed. Nd: YAG capsulotomy and PCO incidence proportions were reported for 3 IOL cohorts: AcrySof , other hydrophobic and hydrophilic acrylic IOLs. Unadjusted/adjusted odds ratios ( OR) of Nd: YAG capsulotomy were calculated through logistic regression for non-AcrySof cohorts versus AcrySof. A sub-group analysis in single-piece IOLs ( > 90 % of sample eyes) was also performed. The AcrySof cohort included 13,329 eyes , non-AcrySof hydrophobic 19,025 and non-AcrySof hydrophilic 19,808. The 3-year Nd: YAG capsulotomy incidence ( 95 % CI) for AcrySof ( 2.4 % , 2.2-2.7 %) was approximately two times lower than non-AcrySof hydrophobic IOLs ( 4.4 % , 4.1-4.7 %) and approximately fourfold lower than non-AcrySof hydrophilic IOLs ( 10.9 % , 10.5-11.3 %). Trends were similar in PCO incidence ( AcrySof: 4.7 %; non-AcrySof hydrophobic: 6.3 %; non-AcrySof hydrophilic: 14.8 %). Also in the analysis restricted to single-piece IOLs , the pattern remained ( 2.4 % vs 5.1 % vs. 10.9 % , respectively). Adjusted regression analysis showed a approximately two and fivefold increased odds of Nd: YAG for non-AcrySof hydrophobic and hydrophilic acrylic IOLs respectively vs. AcrySof IOLs. Nd: YAG capsulotomy ORs were similar and remained statistically significant in the single-piece IOL sub-group. Real-world evidence shows that within 3 years following implantation , AcrySof IOLs are significantly superior in reducing Nd: YAG capsulotomy and PCO incidence compared to other hydrophilic and hydrophobic acrylic IOLs.
