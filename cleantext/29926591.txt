  To explore a simply feasible and affordable method to establish neuritis migration model induced by Slit 2N and silk fibroin mixture in the rat hippocampal neurons Neurons were derived from SD rat hippocampal tissues and cultured with a special cell culture-plate Neurites of the pure Slit 2N group and the mixture group became shorter , and there was no significant change in the pure silk fibroin and control groups. The results showed that the average duration and length difference before and after changed were in descending order of mixture group , Slit 2N group , silk fibroin group ( There were no significant effects of Silk fibroin on induced by Slit 2N in rat hippocampal neuron migration. It had an effect on reducing Slit 2N diffusion rate and extending its working time. It provides an advantageous construction method
