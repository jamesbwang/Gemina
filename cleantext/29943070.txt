  Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths , with no curative treatments once it spreads. Alternative therapies , including immunotherapy , have shown limited efficacy. Dendritic cells ( DC) have been widely used in the treatment of various malignancies. DC capture antigens and move to the lymphoid organs where they prime naive T cells. Interaction between DC and T cells are most active in lymph nodes and suppression of DC trafficking to lymph nodes impairs the immune response. In this work , we aimed to study trafficking of DC in vivo via various routes of delivery , to optimize the effectiveness of DC-based therapy. A DC labeling system was developed using 1,1 '- dioctadecyltetramethyl indotricarbocyanine Iodine for in vivo fluorescent imaging. DC harvested from C57B/6 mice were matured , labeled , and injected intravenously , subcutaneously , or intratumorally , with or without antigen loading with whole tumor lysate , into C57B/6 mice inoculated with RM-1 murine prostate tumor cells. Signal intensity was measured in vivo and ex vivo. Signal intensity at the tumor site increased over time , suggesting trafficking of DC to the tumor with all modes of injection. Subcutaneous injection showed preferential trafficking to lymph nodes and tumor. Intravenous injection showed trafficking to lungs , intestines , and spleen. Subcutaneous injection of DC pulsed with whole tumor lysate resulted in the highest increase in signal intensity at the tumor site and lymph nodes , suggesting subcutaneous injection of primed DC leads to highest preferential trafficking of DC to the immunocompetent organs.
