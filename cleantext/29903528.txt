  Critically ill patients present with a broad spectrum of gastrointestinal motility disorders that affect the digestive tract. Our aim was to compare the effect of two prokinetic drugs on gastric electrical rhythm in critically ill septic patients , measured through surface electrogastrography ( EGG). A prospective triple-blinded randomized study was conducted on 36 patients admitted to the intensive care unit ( ICU) with the diagnosis of septic shock<symptom>. They were randomized to receive metoclopramide or domperidone. We assessed dominant frequency ( DF) , percentage distribution over time , and dominant power ( DP) , which represents the strength of contraction , before and after administration of the study drugs. Reliable electrogastrograms were achieved in all patients. In relation to the distribution of DF over time , 64 % of patients had dysrhythmia , the mean baseline DF was 2.9 cpm , and the mean DP was 56.5 μv After drug administration , 58 % of the patients had dysrhythmia , the mean DF increased to 5.7 cpm ( P < .05) , and the DP did not change ( 57.4 μv Both metoclopramide and domperidone similarly increased the DF of gastric pacemaker activity and improved gastric motility by restoring a normogastric pattern. Gastric dysmotility is frequent in septic patients.
