  This study was planned to explore the clinical and hematological profile of febrile neutropenia ( FN) in Indian children with focus on correlation of degree of neutropenia with fever<disease> and procalcitonin ( PCT) level and the utility of serum PCT levels in cases of FN. Children below 12 years , receiving chemotherapy for hematological malignancy having oral temperature more than 100 Â°F and absolute neutrophil count ( ANC) below 500/mm Four categories were made based on serum PCT levels which had negative correlation with ANC but no correlation with microbiologically detected infections. PCT is generally used to support the diagnosis of bacterial infection or sepsis<disease> in the emergency department or to monitor the treatment of sepsis<disease> with regard to reviewing antimicrobial treatment. The use of PCT has been well established as a marker for infection in adults and in nonneutropenic children , but similar data are lacking in pediatric population , more so in children with FN in Indian contexts. This study aims to fulfill this lacuna. The higher levels of PCT had a high negative correlation with ANC but low correlation with microbiologically detected infections.
