  Ultrasonic transmission measurements have been used for decades to monitor concrete elements , mostly on a laboratory scale. Recently , coda wave interferometry ( CWI) , a technique adapted from seismology , was introduced to civil engineering experiments. It can be used to reveal subtle changes in concrete laboratory samples and even large structural elements without having a transducer directly at the place where the change is taking place. Here , several load tests until failure on large posttensioned concrete beams have been monitored using networks of embedded transducers. To detect subtle effects at the beginning of the experiments and cope with severe<symptom> changes<symptom> due to cracking close to failure , the coda wave interferometry procedures had to be modified to an adapted step-wise approach. Using this methodology , we were able to monitor stress distribution and localize large cracks by a relatively simple technique. Implementation of this approach on selected real structures might help to make decisions in infrastructure asset management.
