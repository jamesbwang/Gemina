  University students engage in risky patterns of alcohol consumption , which may affect their health and performance at university. This study provides a novel analysis which tracked students ' interaction with online course materials over time , and examined associations between online activity and alcohol related harm ( as indicated by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test). Study 1 tracked 63 undergraduate psychology students in the second half of a semester and found risky drinking behaviors were marginally related to reductions in online study activity. Study 2 tracked 88 undergraduate psychology students in the first half of a semester. Risky drinking behaviors were associated with less online activity after midday. Students reporting more alcohol related harm were less likely to login between 7 pm and midnight , and between 1 am and 6 am. This study demonstrates a potential sensitivity of online activity levels to alcohol use.
