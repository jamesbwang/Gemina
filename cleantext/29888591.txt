  Flexible molecular crystals with stimuli-responsive properties are highly desirable; however , uncovering them is still a challenging goal. Herein , we report a cocrystal approach to obtain elastic molecular crystals that exhibit light-induced fluorescence changes and dynamic mechanical responses at the macroscale level. Cocrystals of naphthylvinylpyridine and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid were fabricated in different stoichiometry ratios ( 2:1 and 1:1) , which present different shapes ( two-dimensional ( 2D) and one-dimensional ( 1D) morphologies) , photoemission , and mechanical properties ( rigidity and flexibility). Moreover , obviously different photomechanical energy conversions ( light-driven cracking/popping and bending/motion) occur for the 2D and 1D cocrystals , respectively. Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) spectra show the occurrence of photoinduced ( 2 + 2) cycloaddition in both cocrystals , which is the primary mechanism for their photoactuating behaviors. Crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculation further reveal that protonation and the hydrogen-bonding network play important roles in light-stimulus-bendable 1D cocrystal. Thus , the transformation from rigidity to flexibility based on cocrystallization with different stoichiometry may offer an effective means to tune the dynamic light-driven responses for smart crystalline materials.
