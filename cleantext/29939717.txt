  The development of GaN-on-diamond devices holds much promise for the creation of high-power density electronics. Inherent to the growth of these devices , a dielectric layer is placed between the GaN and diamond , which can contribute significantly to the overall thermal resistance of the structure. In this work , we explore the role of different interfaces in contributing to the thermal resistance of the interface of GaN/diamond layers , specifically using 5 nm layers of AlN , SiN , or no interlayer at all. Using time-domain thermoreflectance along with electron energy loss spectroscopy , we were able to determine that a SiN interfacial layer provided the lowest thermal boundary resistance ( < 10 m
