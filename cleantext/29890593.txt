  Combustion and pyrolysis runs at 850 Â°C were carried out in a laboratory scale horizontal reactor with different materials combining biomass and waste electrical and electronic equipment ( WEEE). Analyses are presented of the carbon oxides , light hydrocarbons , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) , polychlorinated benzenes ( ClBzs) , polychlorinated phenols ( ClPhs) , polybrominated phenols ( BrPhs) , polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs). Results showed that gas emissions were mainly composed of CO and CO
