  Icariside II ( ICA II) is used in erectile dysfunction treatment. Adipose tissue-derived stem cells ( ADSCs) are efficient at improving erectile function. This study aimed to explore the action mechanism of ADSCs in improving erectile function. ADSCs were isolated from the adipose tissues of rats. Cell proliferation was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 ( CCK-8) assay. The expressions of mRNA and protein were determined separately through qRT-PCR and western blot. The endogenous expressions of related genes were regulated using recombinant plasmids and cell transfection. A Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay was performed to determine the interaction between miR-34a and STAT3. Rat models with bilateral cavernous nerve injuries ( BCNIs) were used to assess erectile function through the detection of mean arterial pressure ( MAP) and intracavernosal pressure ( ICP). ICA II promoted ADSCs ' proliferation and differentiation to Schwann cells ( SCs) through the inhibition of miR-34a. Suppressed miR-34a promoted the differentiation of ADSCs to SCs by upregulating STAT3. ICA II promoted the differentiation of ADSCs to SCs through the miR-34a/ STAT3 pathway. The combination of ICA II and ADSCs preserved the erectile function of the BCNI model rats. ADSCs treated with ICA II markedly preserved the erectile function of the BCNI model rats , which was reversed through miR-34a overexpression. ICA II promotes the differentiation of ADSCs to SCs through the miR-34a/ STAT3 pathway , contributing to erectile function preservation after the occurrence of a cavernous nerve injury.
