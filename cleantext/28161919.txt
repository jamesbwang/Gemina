  A 49-year old male with corrected visual acuity of 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS was found to have an asymptomatic dark iris mass OD with suspicion for ciliary body melanoma. Predilation slit-lamp biomicroscopy revealed a well-circumscribed brown round mass arising posterior to the iris , presumably from the ciliary body; however , postdilation demonstrated an extended fusiform mass of the iris pigment epithelium ( IPE). By anterior segment imaging , the well-circumscribed IPE mass was cystic and measured 1440 microns in thickness peripherally predilation and 300 microns in thickness postdilation. There was no solid IPE or ciliary body component. A diagnosis of midzonal IPE cyst<symptom> was rendered and observation advised. Clinical features and anterior segment imaging can assist in differentiation of midzonal IPE cyst<symptom> from adenoma and ciliary body melanoma. The diagnostic methodology described in this paper can be used by ophthalmologists to promptly rule out underlying melanoma.
