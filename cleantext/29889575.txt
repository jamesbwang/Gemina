  Ticagrelor is a direct and reversible competitive antagonist of the P2Y12 receptor and inhibits platelet activation. Although adverse bleeding is common , fatal intoxication has never been documented. A 47-year-old man died from a severe cerebral hemorrhage<symptom> secondary to a fall and cranial trauma 4 d after the massive intake of ticagrelor. Iterative platelet transfusions did not improve his condition. Toxicological analyses by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS) revealed high plasma concentrations of ticagrelor ( 3343 µg/L) and its active metabolite AR-C124910XX ( 656 µg/L) 10 h after intake. The approximate ingested dose was extrapolated to 1677 mg. Assessment of ADP-induced platelet aggregation and platelet Vasodilator Stimulated Phosphoprotein phosphorylation ( VASP) , 2 and 3 d after admission , respectively , showed the persistence of platelet inhibition. To the best of our knowledge , no prior fatal cases have been reported and documented with both ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX concentrations. Our findings highlight the need for a specific antidote to manage such complications resulting from ticagrelor overdose.
