  Intracellular drug delivery systems are often limited by their poor serum stability and delivery efficiency. Cell-penetrating peptides ( CPPs) , particularly those derived from basic protein subunits , have been studied extensively in this regard and used for the delivery of a variety of cargoes in vitro. Although promising , traditional cationic CPPs have some drawbacks that hinder their therapeutic application such as rapid proteolytic degradation and undesired interactions with the biological milieu. To overcome these limitations , this article details the discovery of a new class of noncharged cell-penetrating oligoTEAs ( CPOTs) that undergo extensive and rapid cellular entry across different cell lines with low cytotoxicity. CPOTs outperform a widely used CPP , R9 peptide. This new class of highly efficient noncharged macromolecular transporters are distinct from their cationic counterparts and show strong promise for the intracellular delivery of hydrophilic small-molecule therapeutics.
