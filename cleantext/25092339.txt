  The presence of H3K27me3 has been demonstrated to correlate with the CpG content. In this work , we tested whether H3K27ac has similar sequence preferences. We performed a translocation of DNA sequences with various properties into a beta globin locus to control for the local chromatin environment. We demonstrate that H3K27ac is not linked to CpG content of the sequence , while extremely high GC-content may contribute to the establishment of this mark.
