  High-throughput screening ( HTS) performs the experimental testing of a large number of chemical compounds aiming to identify those active in the considered assay. Alternatively , faster and cheaper methods of large-scale virtual screening are performed computationally through quantitative structure-activity relationship ( QSAR) models. However , the vast amount of available HTS heterogeneous data and the imbalanced ratio of active to inactive compounds in an assay make this a challenging problem. Although different QSAR models have been proposed , they have certain limitations , e.g. , high false positive rates , complicated user interface , and limited utilization options. Therefore , we developed DPubChem , a novel web tool for deriving QSAR models that implement the state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to enhance the precision of the models and enable efficient analyses of experiments from PubChem BioAssay database. DPubChem also has a simple interface that provides various options to users. DPubChem predicted active compounds for 300 datasets with an average geometric mean and F
