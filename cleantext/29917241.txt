  NMDA receptors ( NMDARs) are tetrameric complexes comprising two glycine-binding GluN1 and two glutamate-binding GluN2 subunits. Four GluN2 subunits encoded by different genes can produce up to ten different di- and triheteromeric receptors. In addition , some neurological patients contain a de novo mutation or inherited rare variant in only one subunit. There is currently no mechanistic framework to describe tetrameric receptor function that can be extended to receptors with two different GluN1 or GluN2 subunits. Here we use the structural features of glutamate receptors to develop a mechanism describing both single channel and macroscopic NMDAR currents. We propose that each agonist-bound subunit undergoes some rate-limiting conformational change after agonist binding , prior to channel opening. We hypothesize that this conformational change occurs within a triad of interactions between a short helix preceding the M1 transmembrane helix , the highly conserved M3 motif encoded by the residues SYTANLAAF , and the linker preceding the M4 transmembrane helix of the adjacent subunit. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that pre-M1 helix motion is uncorrelated between subunits , which we interpret to suggest independent subunit-specific conformational changes may influence these pre-gating steps. According to this interpretation , these conformational changes are the main determinants of the key kinetic properties of NMDA receptor activation following agonist binding , and so these steps sculpt their physiological role. We show that this structurally-derived tetrameric model describes both single channel and macroscopic data , giving a new approach to interpreting functional properties of synaptic NMDARs that provides a logical framework to understanding receptors with non-identical subunits.
