  Accelerated epigenetic aging , the difference between the DNA methylation-predicted age ( DNAm age) and the chronological age , is associated with a myriad of diseases. This study investigates the relationship between epigenetic aging and risk and protective factors of PTSD. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed in 211 individuals including combat-exposed Australian veterans ( discovery cohort , n = 96 males) and trauma-exposed civilian males from the Grady Trauma Project ( replication cohort , n = 115 males). Primary measures included the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale ( CD-RISC). DNAm age prediction was performed using the validated epigenetic clock calculator. Veterans with PTSD had increased PTSD symptom severity ( P-value = 3.75 Ã— 10
