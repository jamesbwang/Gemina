  Increasing evidence indicates that regulated necrosis<symptom> plays a critical role during cell death caused by ischemia-reperfusion ( IR) injury. Necroptosis is one form of regulated necrosis<symptom>. Necrostatin-1 ( Nec-1) , an inhibitor of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 ( RIPK1) , is known to reduce necroptosis. We investigated the effect of Nec-1 treatment on IR-induced lung injury in a rat lung transplant model. Lewis rats were divided into 4 groups ( n = 6 each): ( 1) Control ( no treatment) , ( 2) Donor treatment ( D) , ( 3) Recipient treatment ( R) , and ( 4) Donor plus Recipient treatment ( D+R) groups. Donor lungs were flushed and preserved for 18 hours at 4ÂºC before transplantation. Recipient animals underwent a left single lung transplant. After 2 hours of reperfusion , we assessed the physiologic function , cytokine expression , pathway activation , and the extent of necrosis<symptom>. Pulmonary gas exchange in D+R group was significantly better than in the other 3 groups ( p = 0.003). Lung edema<symptom> was significantly lower in the D+R group compared with the Control group ( p = 0.006). The expression of interleukin-6 in lung tissue and plasma was significantly reduced in the D+R group compared with the Control group ( p = 0.036). The percentage of necrotic cells in D+R group was significantly lower than in the Control and D groups ( p = 0.01) , indicating Nec-1inhibited regulated necrosis<symptom>. The administration of Nec-1 to both donor and recipient improved graft function after lung transplantation through the reduction of necroptosis. The inhibition of regulated necrosis<symptom> appears to be a promising strategy to attenuate IR lung injury after lung transplantation.
