  A latitudinal diversity gradient towards the tropics appears as one most recurrent patterns in ecology , but the mechanisms underlying this pattern remain an area of controversy. In angiosperms , the tropical conservatism hypothesis proposes that most groups originated in the tropics and are adapted to a tropical climatic regime , and that relatively few species have evolved physiological adaptations to cold , dry or unpredictable climates. This mechanism is , however , unlikely to apply across land plants , and in particular , to liverworts , a group of about 7500 species , whose ability to withstand cold much better than their tracheophyte counterparts is at odds with the tropical conservatism hypothesis. Molecular dating , diversification rate analyses and ancestral area reconstructions were employed to explore the evolutionary mechanisms that account for the latitudinal diversity gradient in liverworts. As opposed to angiosperms , tropical liverwort genera are not older than their extra-tropical counterparts ( median stem age of tropical and extra-tropical liverwort genera of 24.35 ± 39.65 Ma and 39.57 ± 49.07 Ma , respectively) , weakening the ` time for speciation hypothesis '. Models of ancestral area reconstructions with equal migration rates between tropical and extra-tropical regions outperformed models with asymmetrical migration rates in either direction. The symmetry and intensity of migrations between tropical and extra-tropical regions suggested by the lack of resolution in ancestral area reconstructions towards the deepest nodes are at odds with the tropical niche conservatism hypothesis. In turn , tropical genera exhibited significantly higher net diversification rates than extra-tropical ones , suggesting that the observed latitudinal diversity gradient results from either higher extinction rates in extra-tropical lineages or higher speciation rates in the tropics. We discuss a series of experiments to help deciphering the underlying evolutionary mechanisms.
