  The employment of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) has been shown to improve airway limitation , decrease treatment failure and risk of relapse , and may improve symptoms in addition to decreasing the length of hospital stay. Nowadays , all clinical guidelines recommend systemic corticosteroids to treat moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. However , their use is associated with potential side effects , mainly hyperglycemia. In the era of precision medicine , the possibility of employing blood eosinophil count has emerged as a potential way of optimizing therapy. Issues regarding the intra-individual variability of blood eosinophil count determination , a lack of clear data regarding the real prevalence of eosinophilic acute exacerbations , the fact that previously published studies have demonstrated the benefit of systemic corticosteroids irrespective of eosinophil levels , and especially the fact that there is only one well-designed study justifying this approach have led us to think that we are not ready to use eosinophil count to guide treatment with systemic corticosteroids during acute exacerbations of COPD.
