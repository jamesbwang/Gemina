  During the 19th century , suicide rates increased in many countries. The press may have contributed to this increase , even though empirical evidence is lacking in this regard. We assessed suicide statistics within five territories of the Austro-Hungarian Empire between 1871 and 1910 and combined these data with a content analysis of suicide reporting in five newspapers , each appearing in one of the five territories. The analysis revealed a covariation between the quantity of reporting and the number of suicides within all five regions. Furthermore , the quantity of reporting significantly predicted the following year 's suicides. Although the causal order of suicides and the quantity of reporting should be assessed with caution , evidence is consistent with the idea that the press may have contributed to the establishment of suicide as a mass phenomenon. The findings also support contemporary guidelines for journalists , especially the notion of avoiding undue repetition of suicide stories.
