  Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD) is the major cause of blindness<symptom> in the elderly in developed countries and its prevalence is increasing with the aging population. AMD initially affects the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE) and gradually leads to secondary photoreceptor degeneration. Recent studies have associated mitochondrial damage with AMD , and we have observed mitochondrial and autophagic dysfunction and repressed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha ( PGC-1α in native RPE from AMD donor eyes and their respective induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE ( AMD RPE-iPSC-RPE). To further investigate the effect of PGC-1α repression we have established a mouse model by feeding
