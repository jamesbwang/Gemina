  To study correlation among number ( n) , diameter ( D) , and blood reflux time ( t) and the left common iliac vein stenosis degree of the expansion of perforating veins , so as to guide the clinical formulation and adjust the treatment plan. Retrospective analysis of 45 PVs patients with left common iliac vein in different degrees of compression in our hospital from 2010 to 2012 was performed. Left common iliac vein was divided into 50 % -69 % , 70 % -99 % , 30 % -49 % and occlusion of the stenosis to avoid the error of the left iliac vein stenosis. Pearson 's correlation analysis among the number , diameter , and blood reflux time of perforating veins and left common iliac vein was performed. Pearson 's correlation analysis among the number , diameter , and blood back flow time of perforating veins , and the degree of stenosis was performed , and these results showed that correlation coefficients among the number , diameter , and blood return the PVs between flow time and the degree of stenosis were rp-n = 0.784 , rp-d = 0.893 , rp-t = 0.845 ( P < .001) , respectively. The two variables exist positive correlation and correlation was significant. With the increase in left common iliac vein stenosis , the number of perforating veins and the diameter increased , and the time of blood flow were prolonged.
