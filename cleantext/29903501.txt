  In 2011 , the Institute of Medicine recommended that 80 % of RNs have a bachelor 's degree or higher by 2020. Progress toward this recommendation has been slow. This paper presents a model that projects whether the 80 % recommendation can be met within a 10-year period and estimates the impact of education changes that might accelerate progress. A projection model for 2016 to 2026 was created using a `` stock-and-flow '' approach. Secondary data were extracted from multiple sources for the projections. The model includes the option to enter alternative values of key parameters to estimate the impact of changes. Based on current patterns of entry-level and RN-to-BSN education , approximately 66 % of RNs are projected to have BSN + education by 2025. To reach the 80 % goal by 2025 , changes in the mix of entry-level education and/or an increase in the number of RN-to-BSN graduates will be required.
