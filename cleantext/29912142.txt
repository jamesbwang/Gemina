  The aim of this study was to compare outcomes after rapid-deployment aortic valve replacement ( RDAVR) and conventional aortic valve replacement ( AVR) from two studies. Patients who underwent RDAVR ( INTUITY valve) in the prospective , 5-year , single-arm multicenter TRITON study , or conventional AVR ( Perimount Magna<pathogen> Ease valve) in the prospective Perimount Magna<pathogen> Ease postmarket study , were propensity score matched and compared for procedural , hemodynamic , safety , and clinical outcomes. Matched RDAVR ( n = 106) and conventional AVR ( n = 106) patients had similar baseline characteristics ( mean ± SD age , 72.8 ± 7.6 vs 72.5 ± 7.4 years; male 59.4 % vs 61.3 %) and procedures ( concomitant procedures: 41.5 % vs 50.9 %). Mean ± SD aortic cross-clamp time was significantly shorter in RDAVR than AVR patients ( 51.8 ± 20.9 vs 73.9 ± 33.2 minutes; P < 0.001) , as was mean cardiopulmonary bypass time ( 82.8 ± 34.2 vs 102.4 ± 41.7 minutes; P < 0.001). At 1 year , RDAVR patients showed significantly lower mean ± SD and peak aortic valve gradients ( 9.0 ± 3.4 and 17.0 ± 6.2 mm Hg , respectively) than conventional AVR patients ( 13.4 ± 5.5 and 24.2 ± 10.8 mm Hg , respectively; all P < 0.001). Patient-prosthesis mismatch was significantly less common with RDAVR than with AVR ( overall: 16/66 ( 24.2 %) vs 46/76 ( 60.5 %); P = 0.007; severe: 2/66 ( 3.0 %) vs 13/76 ( 17.1 %)). There were no significant differences between the RDAVR and AVR groups regarding 30-day safety endpoints. Survival rates in the RDAVR and conventional AVR groups were , respectively , 99.1 % and 100.0 % at 30 days , 97.1 % and 95.1 % at 1 year , and 93.3 % and 94.1 % at 3 years ( P = nonsignificant). In this retrospective study with matched populations , the RDAVR with the INTUITY valve system provided superior procedural and hemodynamic outcomes than a standard bioprosthesis without compromising safety.
