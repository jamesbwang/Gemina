  Background Anewexperimental protocol of electrically induced pain and hyperalgesia was established to examine orally administered drugs. In a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over study this experimental protocol was used to assess the effects of paracetamol. Methods Twenty-four subjects were enrolled in this study. The magnitude of pain , axon reflex flare , and areas of pin-prick hyperalgesia and touch-evoked allodynia were assessed in two consecutive sessions; prior to , and 2 h after drug administration. This protocol was repeated after 1 week. Subjects were randomized to receive either paracetamol ( 2 g) or a placebo. Results In comparison to the placebo arm there were no significant effects of paracetamol on pain , hyperalgesia , allodynia , or axon reflex flare. Pain and flare responses were highly reproducible on the same day ( r = 0.77 and r = 0.79 , respectively) , and after 1 week ( r = 0.6 and r = 0.71 , respectively). The correlation between areas of hyperalgesia and allodynia was , however , significantly improved when the protocol was repeated on the same day ( r = 0.8 and r = 0.75) , as opposed to after a week ( r = 0.54 and r = 0.53). Discussion The electrical pain model is a well established method for the assessment of intravenously applied analgesics. In order to assess effects of orally applied drugs the model had to be modified: for the assessment of hyperalgesia and allodynia a protocol repeating the model within 1 day proved to have advantages over repetition after 1 week.
