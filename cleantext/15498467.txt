  Mobile genetic elements classed as transposons comprise an estimated 45 % of the human genome , and 8 % of these elements are human endogenous retroviruses ( HERVs). Endogenous retroviruses are retrotransposons , containing 5 ' and 3 ' long terminal repeat sequences and encoding envelope , group-specific antigen and DNA polymerase proteins. The aim of the present study was to analyse genome integration polymorphisms of HERV type K member 6 ( HERV-K6) and HERV-K11 by using the retrotransposon based molecular marker technique , inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism ( IRAP). For this purpose , blood samples of 18 healthy individuals within the age range of 10-79 years ( 10 females and 8 males) were collected , genomic DNAs were isolated and IRAP-polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) was performed. IRAP-PCR analyses demonstrated that there were 0-70 % polymorphism rates for HERV-K6 , and 0-38 % polymorphism rates for HERV-K11 among all the samples. Furthermore , the polymorphism rates were 0-70 % among females and 11-60 % among males for HERV-K6 , and 0-38 % among females and 0-25 % among males for HERV-K11. Age-associated polymorphism was also investigated , but no age-associated polymorphism was observed among the samples. Therefore , HERV-K6 and HERV-K11 polymorphisms may arise on an individual-specific basis. Various previous studies have investigated the associations between the expression of HERVs and cancer or other major diseases. However , few reports have analysed HERV-K movements among individuals. This is the first report to investigate HERV-K6 and HERV-K11 retrotransposon polymorphisms between the genders and different age groups.
