  The diagnostic work up of adrenal tumours , often incidentally discovered , has emerged as an ever-increasing diagnostic problem for clinical endocrinologists. No imaging modality has sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity at differentiating benign from malignant adrenal lesions<symptom>. It has long been observed that adrenocortical carcinomas ( ACCs) present an immature pattern of steroidogenesis , dominated by steroid hormone precursors. Modern mass spectrometry-based assays can generate multi-steroid metabolite profiles in urine collections , which can detect differences between ACCs and benign adrenocortical adenomas ( ACAs). This review summarizes the promising results of studies which have applied steroid metabolite profiling in biological fluids as a novel diagnostic tool for patients with adrenal tumours , as well as the challenges and limitations of this approach. It also discusses the potential role of steroid profiling as a surveillance biochemical tool to detect recurrence in patients who have undergone resection of an ACC.
