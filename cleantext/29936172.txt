  Biofouling represents a major economic , environmental and health concern for which new eco-friendly solutions are needed. International legislation has restricted the use of biocidal-based antifouling coatings , and increasing efforts have been applied in the search for environmentally friendly antifouling agents. This research work deals with the assessment of the interest of a series of synthetic chalcone derivatives for antifouling applications. Sixteen chalcone derivatives were synthesized with moderate yields ( 38-85 %). Antifouling bioactivity of these compounds was assessed at different levels of biological organization using both anti-macrofouling and anti-microfouling bioassays , namely an anti-settlement assay using mussel ( Mytilus galloprovincialis) larvae<pathogen> , as well as marine bacteria and microalgal biofilms growth inhibition bioassays. Results showed that three compounds ( 11 , 12 , and 16) were particularly active against the settlement of mussel larvae ( EC
