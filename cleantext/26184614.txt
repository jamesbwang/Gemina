  Aortic stenosis ( AS) is the most common valvular disease in the elderly and is associated with poor outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) is an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR) in high-risk patients. Herein , we describe the gender-related differences in baseline characteristics and pathophysiologic response to severe AS , imaging considerations unique to females , and short- and long-term outcomes after TAVR. Women undergoing TAVR are older and frailer , have less cardiovascular comorbidities , smaller femoral artery size , better left ventricular systolic function , hypertrophied and small left ventricles leading to a higher incidence of paradoxical low-flow low-gradient AS , and a greater prevalence of porcelain aorta , smaller aortic annulus size , and lower coronary ostia heights. Imaging and histopathological data also suggests a sex-related myocardial response to pressure overload from AS. Women experience more vascular complications and blood transfusion requirements , serious procedural complications , and a greater incidence of stroke , but have better long-term outcomes than men. Patient-prosthesis mismatch , which is a concern in patients with a small aortic annulus size undergoing SAVR , has not been problematic with TAVR. The aforementioned findings suggest that TAVR may be preferable for women with severe AS. Further studies are warranted to directly compare TAVR with SAVR in women.
