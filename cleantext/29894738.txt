  Cephalandole A 2 , a small indole alkaloid isolated from the Taiwanese orchid Cephalanceropsis gracilis<pathogen> ( Orchidaceae) , exhibits anticancer activity. Surprisingly , this natural product has not been evaluated for any other biological activity so far. To discover other novel potential of Cephalandole A 2 , an efficient and economic synthetic protocol for novel Cephalandole A analogues 21a-o has been developed , in only 3 steps from using indole , and applied for their biological activity. Biological testing showed that Cephalandole A 2 and its novel analogues 21a-o exhibited potential antimicrobial and antiplatelet activity in preliminary assay. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of Cephalandole A 2 and its novel synthetic analogues 21a-o as a new class of antimicrobial and antiplatelet agents. In this study , 2 and other analogues i.e. , 21b , 21d , 21i and 21o showed promising antimicrobial activity against the phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi<pathogen> Cephalandole A 2 , 21c , 21f and 21i , also showed potent antiplatelet activity.
