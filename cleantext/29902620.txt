  The retention behavior of three toxic chemicals , As , Cr and B , was investigated for an outcropping rock formation , the Albian Tégulines Clay ( France , Aube). At a shallow depth , Tégulines Clay is affected by weathering processes leading to contrasted geochemical conditions with depth. One of the main features of the weathering is the occurrence of a redox transition zone near the surface. Batch sorption experiments of As ( V) , As ( III) , Cr ( VI) and B were performed on samples collected at two depths representative either of oxidized or reduced mineral assemblages. Batch sorption experiments highlighted a distinct behavior between As , Cr and B oxyanions. Cr ( VI) retention behavior was dominated by redox phenomena , notably its reduction to Cr ( III). The in-situ redox state of the Tégulines Clay samples has a significant effect on Cr retention. On the contrary , As ( V) reduction into As ( III) is moderate and its retention slightly affected by the in-situ redox state of the Tégulines Clay. As ( V) retention is higher than As ( III) retention in agreement with literature data. B retention is strongly related to its natural abundance in the Tégulines clay samples. Distribution coefficient of B corrected from its natural content is expected to be very low for in-situ conditions. Finally , the retention and mobility of these oxyanions were affected by clay mineralogy , natural abundance , and reducing capacity of the Tegulines Clay.
