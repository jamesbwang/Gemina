  Coal combustion is one of the most significant anthropogenic sources of thallium in the environment. This study presents the results of determination of thallium and some toxic elements ( Pb , Cd , As , Ni , Zn , and Cu) concentration in fly ash produced in the coal combustion in conventional furnaces ( pulverized coal furnace and grate furnace) , in a fluidized-bed furnace with circulation bed , and in a home furnace. The high content of thallium was determined in ash produced in the grate furnace ( on average 10.7 mg/kg) and fluidized-bed furnace with circulation bed ( 6.6 mg/kg). The average content of Tl in the fly ash of the pulverized coal furnace and in the home furnace is 1.7 and 2.4 mg/kg , respectively. There was a strong relationship between the occurrence of Tl and As , Cd , Pb , Cu , and Zn in ash from grate and pulverized coal furnace.
