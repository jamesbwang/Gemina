  Quantitative computed tomography ( QCT)- derived measures of lung density are valued methods for objectively characterizing lung parenchymal and peripheral airways disease and are being used in a growing number of lung disease focused trials. Detector and reconstruction improvements in CT technology have allowed for significant radiation dose reduction in image acquisition with comparable qualitative image quality. We report the impact of detector type and reconstruction type on QCT lung density measures in relation to decreasing dose indices. Two sets of studies were completed in an in vivo pig model with a SOMATOM Definition Flash CT system: ( a) prior to system upgrade with conventional detectors ( UFC) and filtered back projection ( FBP) , and ( b) post system upgrade with integrated electronic detectors ( STELLAR) and iterative reconstruction ( SAFIRE). CT data were acquired across estimated CT volume dose indices ( CTDI In this study , STELLAR detectors improved concordance with 15 mGy values down to 3 mGy for inspiratory scans and 6 mGy for expiratory scans. The addition of SAFIRE reconstruction in all acquired measurements resulted in minimal deviation from reference values at 0.75 mGy. The use of STELLAR integrated electronic detectors and SAFIRE iterative reconstruction may allow for comparable lung density measures with CT dose indices down to 0.75 mGy.
