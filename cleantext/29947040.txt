  A library of poly ( methyl methacrylate)- block-polystyrene ( PMMA-b-PS) block copolymers ( BCPs) bearing small amounts ( < 10 mol %) of functional comonomer in either one or both blocks is investigated for their phase separation behavior in bulk and in thin films. Particularly , functionalities typically involved in modern postpolymerization modifications are considered , e.g. , azide , pentafluorophenyl , furfuryl. Small-angle X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy are employed to determine the characteristic dimensional features of lamellae-forming BCPs , which differ essentially in the functional groups. It is shown that the presence of the reactive moieties does not perturb the ability to phase separate in bulk , yet has an impact on the dimensions of the domains. Using a classic two-step procedure involving surface neutralization with a statistical PMMA-co-PS copolymer , it is observed that some functional copolymers are not able to form homogeneous thin films. Solvent stability and crosslinking ability of the films are then briefly assessed as a first step to establishing the functional films as nanoresolved molecular immobilization platform with feature sizes of 20 nm and below.
