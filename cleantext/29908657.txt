  Herein , we report the rational design , synthesis and biological evaluation of conjugates consisting of the synthetic retinoid Am580 and biotin connected via a linker moiety. We found that the linking substructure between the retinoid part and the biotin part is critical for retaining the biological activity. Conjugate 4 with a shorter linker showed similar potency to endogenous retinoid ATRA ( 1) and the parent compound Am580 ( 2) for neural differentiation of mouse embryotic carcinoma P19 cells , and showed the same pattern of induction of gene expression. It is expected to be useful as a probe for investigations of retinoid function. The design rationale and structure-activity relationship of the linker moiety are expected to be helpful for developing biotin conjugates of other nuclear receptor ligands.
