  The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate ( PEP): carbohydrate phosphotransferase system ( PTS) regulates a variety of cellular processes in addition to catalyzing the coupled transport and phosphorylation of carbohydrates. We recently reported that , in the presence of glucose , HPr of the PTS is dephosphorylated and interacts with pyruvate kinase A ( PykA) catalyzing the conversion of PEP to pyruvate in
