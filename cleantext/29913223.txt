  The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between tacrolimus ( TAC) immunosuppressive treatment and serum concentrations of immunoglobulin heavy/light chain pairs ( sHLC) and free light chains ( sFLC) in patients after heart transplantation ( HTX) and to use these biomarkers to predict the risk of infection in these patients. A total of 88 patients with an immunosuppressive regimen involving tacrolimus who underwent HTX were analyzed over 24 months of follow-up. sFLC and sHLC levels were determined before and at three time points after HTX. TAC concentrations were determined at several time points after HTX , and mean TAC concentrations and areas under the curve ( AUCs) of TAC concentration were calculated. Relevant clinical data were obtained from patients ' medical records. A larger AUC of TAC was associated with decreases in the concentrations of IgG total ( p < 0.05); similarly , cumulative AUC of TAC during 18 post-transplant months correlated inversely with sHLC IgG kappa ( r = -0.228 , p < 0.05) and IgG total ( r = -0.352 , p < 0.05). Concentrations of sFLC kappa , sFLC lambda , sHLC IgG kappa , and sHLC IgG total were significantly lower in infected patients ( in the 9th month after HTX , all p < 0.05). Combined criteria for increased AUC ( greater than the median of 12.9 mg Â· d/l) and decreased sFLC kappa ( less than the median of 12.5 mg/l) correlated with the presence of infection ( p < 0.03) in the 9th month after HTX. Ratio of concentration of TAC to sFLC kappa or lambda was significantly higher in infected patients ( both p < 0.05). Intensive treatment with tacrolimus after HTX is possibly reflected by decreases in sFLC and sHLC ( mainly sHLC IgG). Patients with decreased concentrations of these biomarkers are at increased risk for infection , primarily in the 9th month after HTX , when the concentrations of tacrolimus were the highest.
