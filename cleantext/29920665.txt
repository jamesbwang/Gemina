  In this issue , Yeh et al. ( 2018) investigated whether sexual imprinting could act as an assortative mating mechanism , reducing hybridization and increasing premating isolation. While they indeed find that imprinting leads to assortative mating and reduced hybridization , the strength at which imprinting evolves is usually intermediate , because it is counterbalanced by the costs of imprinting and the benefits of adaptive hybridization. Thus , while sexual imprinting can act as an assortative mating mechanism , it is often not the sole element of female mate choice.
