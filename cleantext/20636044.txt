  Extra-synaptic exocytosis is an essential component of cellular communication. A knowledge gap exists in the exocytosis of the non-redox active transmitter acetylcholine. Using the nano-interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions and scanning electrochemical microscopy ( SECM) , a high resolution spatiotemporal study of acetylcholine exocytosis is shown from an individual neuronal soma. The nanoelectrode was positioned âˆ¼ 140 nm away from the release sites on the soma using an SECM. The quantitative study enables the obtaining of key information related to cellular communication , including extracellular concentration of the neurotransmitter , cellular permeability , Ca
