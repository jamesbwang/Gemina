  Long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) , which are longer than 200 nucleotides but often unstable , contribute a substantial and diverse portion to pervasive non-coding transcriptomes. Most lncRNAs are poorly annotated and understood , although several play important roles in gene regulation and diseases. Here we systematically uncover and analyse lncRNAs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Based on RNA-seq data from twelve RNA-processing mutants and nine physiological conditions , we identify 5775 novel lncRNAs , nearly 4-times the previously annotated lncRNAs. The expression of most lncRNAs becomes strongly induced under the genetic and physiological perturbations , most notably during late meiosis. Most lncRNAs are cryptic and suppressed by three RNA-processing pathways: the nuclear exosome , cytoplasmic exonuclease , and RNAi. Double-mutant analyses reveal substantial coordination and redundancy among these pathways. We classify lncRNAs by their dominant pathway into cryptic unstable transcripts ( CUTs) , Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcripts ( XUTs) , and Dicer-sensitive unstable transcripts ( DUTs). XUTs and DUTs are enriched for antisense lncRNAs , while CUTs are often bidirectional and actively translated. The cytoplasmic exonuclease , along with RNAi , dampens the expression of thousands of lncRNAs and mRNAs that become induced during meiosis. Antisense lncRNA expression mostly negatively correlates with sense mRNA expression in the physiological , but not the genetic conditions. Intergenic and bidirectional lncRNAs emerge from nucleosome-depleted regions , upstream of positioned nucleosomes. Our results highlight both similarities and differences to lncRNA regulation in budding yeast. This broad survey of the lncRNA repertoire and characteristics in S. pombe , and the interwoven regulatory pathways that target lncRNAs , provides a rich framework for their further functional analyses.
