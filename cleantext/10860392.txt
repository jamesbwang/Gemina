  Significant changes in body composition are known to occur with aging. The aim of the present study was to provide a normative reference of body composition and to investigate age and sex-related differences in healthy subjects by multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer ( BIA). A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 3451 healthy Chinese adults , 1611 males and 1840 females. The volunteers were enrolled in 5 different age bands ( 18-30 , 31-40 , 41-50 , 51-60 , 60 +). All subjects were measured for weight and height and submitted to BIA , to determine body composition. Body composition measures accounted for differences between men and women.A decrease in fat-free mass and increase in percent body fat was observed with aging , although the phenomenon was proved to be attenuated in women. The central and visceral redistribution of fat mass was also shown along lifetime.This study is a report on body composition of healthy subjects , to be used as an important data for future investigations and differences between nationalities and countries.
