  Among the thermophilic Bacillaceae family members , α-amylase production of 15 bacilli from genus Anoxybacillus was investigated , some of which are biotechnologically important. These Anoxybacillus α-amylase genes displayed ≥ 91.0 % sequence similarities to Anoxybacillus enzymes ( ASKA , ADTA and GSX-BL) , but relatively lower similarities to Geobacillus ( ≤ 69.4 % to GTA , Gt-amyII) , and Bacillus<pathogen> aquimaris ( ≤ 61.3 % to BaqA) amylases , all formerly proposed only in a Glycoside Hydrolase 13 ( GH13) subfamily. The phylogenetic analyses of 63 bacilli-originated protein sequences among 93 α-amylases revealed the overall relationships within Bacillaceae amylolytic enzymes. All bacilli α-amylases formed 5 clades different from 15 predefined GH13 subfamilies. Their phylogenetic findings , taxonomic relationships , temperature requirements , and comparisonal structural analyses ( including their CSR-I-VII regions , 12 sugar- and 4 calcium-binding sites , presence or absence of the complete catalytic machinery , and their currently unassigned status in a valid GH13 subfamiliy) revealed that these five GH13 α-amylase clades related to familly share some common characteristics , but also display differentiative features from each other and the preclassified ones. Based on these findings , we proposed to divide Bacillaceae related GH13 subfamilies into 5 individual groups: the novel a2 subfamily clustered around α-amylase B2M1-A ( Anoxybacillus sp.) , the a1 , a3 and a4 subfamilies ( including the representatives E184aa-A ( Anoxybacillus sp.) , ATA ( Anoxybacillus tepidamans) , and BaqA ,) all of which were composed from the division of the previously grouped single subfamily around α-amylase BaqA , and the undefinite subfamily formerly defined as xy including Bacillus<pathogen> megaterium<pathogen> NL3.
