  There remain areas of uncertainty in optimal technique , preferred candidates , and expected outcome for small animal patients undergoing cardiac intervention. This article highlights issues within interventional cardiology that are in need of study and offers the author 's opinion and experience on topics such as variants of pulmonary valve anatomy and alternatives to conventional balloon dilation for pulmonary valve stenosis , patient selection for cutting or high-pressure balloon dilation of aortic valvar or subaortic stenosis , occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus in very small dogs , ductal stenting in conditions with reduced pulmonary blood flow , and alternative considerations for vascular access and closure.
