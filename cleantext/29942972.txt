  Optical data ( UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra , including fluorescence yields and lifetimes) and electrochemical measurements are used to quantify the modulation of the electronic properties of meso-tetrakis ( pentafluorophenyl)- chlorin diol and- bacteriochlorin tetraols upon intramolecular chromene-annulation , including the investigation of regio- and stereoisomers. The small modulations of the frontier orbitals of the porphyrinoids are rationalized using DFT computations and can be traced to small electronic effects due to the co-planarized meso-aryl groups in combination with conformational effects.
