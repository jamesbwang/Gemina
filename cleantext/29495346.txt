  Smart Home has gained widespread attention due to its flexible integration into everyday life. Pervasive sensing technologies are used to recognize and track the activities that people perform during the day , and to allow communication and cooperation of physical objects. Usually , the available infrastructures and applications leveraging these smart environments have a critical impact on the overall cost of the Smart Home construction , require to be preferably installed during the home construction and are still not user-centric. In this paper , we propose a low cost , easy to install , user-friendly , dynamic and flexible infrastructure able to perform runtime resources management by decoupling the different levels of control rules. The basic idea relies on the usage of off-the-shelf sensors and technologies to guarantee the regular exchange of critical information , without the necessity from the user to develop accurate models for managing resources or regulating their access/usage. This allows us to simplify the continuous updating and improvement , to reduce the maintenance effort and to improve residents & rsquo; living and security. A first validation of the proposed infrastructure on a case study is also presented.
