  Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency ( AATD) is the most common hereditary disorder in adults , but is under-recognized. In Spain , the number of patients diagnosed with AATD is much lower than expected according to epidemiologic studies. The objectives of this study were to assess the frequency and determinants of testing serum α1-antitrypsin ( AAT) levels in COPD patients , and to describe factors associated with testing. EPOCONSUL is a cross-sectional clinical audit , recruiting consecutive COPD cases over one year. The study evaluated serum AAT level determination in COPD patients and associations between individual , disease-related , and hospital characteristics. A total of 4,405 clinical records for COPD patients from 57 Spanish hospitals were evaluated. Only 995 ( 22.5 %) patients had serum AAT tested on some occasion. A number of patient characteristics ( being male ( OR 0.5 , p < 0.001) , ≤ 55 years old ( OR 2.38 , p < 0.001) , BMI ≤ 21 kg/m2 ( OR 1.71 , p < 0.001) , FEV1 ( %) < 50 % ( OR 1.35 , p < 0.001) , chronic bronchitis<symptom> ( OR 0.79 , p < 0.001) , Charlson index ≥ 3 ( OR 0.66 , p < 0.001) , or history or symptoms of asthma ( OR 1.32 , p < 0.001)) , and management at a specialized COPD outpatient clinic ( OR 2.73 , p < 0.001) were identified as factors independently associated with ever testing COPD patients for AATD. Overall , 114 COPD patients ( 11.5 % of those tested) had AATD. Of them , 26 ( 22.8 %) patients had severe deficiency. Patients with AATD were younger , with a low pack-year index , and were more likely to have emphysema ( p < 0.05). Testing of AAT blood levels in COPD patients treated at outpatient respiratory clinics in Spain is infrequent. However , when tested , AATD ( based on the serum AAT levels ≤ 100 mg/dL) is detected in one in five COPD patients. Efforts to optimize AATD case detection in COPD are needed.
