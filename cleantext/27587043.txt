  The purpose of this work is to develop a database of 3D scattered radiation dose-rate distributions to estimate the staff dose by location around a C-Arm fluoroscopic system in an interventional procedure room. The primary x-ray beam of a Toshiba Infinix fluoroscopy machine was modeled using EGSnrc Monte Carlo code and the scattered radiation distributions were calculated using 5 Ã— 10
