  Recently , heterogeneous catalysts have been explored eximiously in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. Therefore , here we used solid-supported heterogeneous silica sulfuric acid as a catalyst for the synthesis of Schiff 's base of 3-chloroformylcoumarin in view of simplified procedure , reusability and acceptable efficiency , which are required in organic synthesis. An efficient and facile methodology is preferred for synthesis of a class of chromeno-3-substituted derivatives (
