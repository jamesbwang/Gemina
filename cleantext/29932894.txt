  Sepsis<disease> is one of the main causes of hospitalization and mortality in Intensive Care Units. One of the first manifestations of sepsis<disease> is encephalopathy , reported in up to 70 % of patients , being associated with higher mortality and morbidity. The factors that cause sepsis-associated encephalopathy ( SAE) are still not well known , and may be multifactorial , as perfusion changes , neuroinflammation , oxidative stress and glycolytic metabolism alterations. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate ( FBP) , a metabolite of the glycolytic route , has been reported as neuroprotective agent. The present study used an experimental sepsis<disease> model in C57BL/6 mice. We used in vivo brain imaging to evaluate glycolytic metabolism through microPET scans and the radiopharmaceutical
