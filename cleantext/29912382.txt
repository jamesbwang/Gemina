  The role of interleukin-6 ( IL-6) in the prediction of intra-abdominal septic complications ( IASCs) in patients with Crohn 's disease ( CD) remains unclear. We assessed the serum IL-6 time course and its association with postoperative IASCs in patients undergoing elective intestinal operations for CD. In total , 118 patients who underwent intestinal operations for CD were prospectively evaluated. They were divided into an IASC group and non-IASC group. Multivariate analyses were used to identify risk factors , and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed. Multivariate analysis showed that a high IL-6 concentration of > 137.25 pg/mL on postoperative day ( POD) 1 was independently associated with IASCs ( odds ratio , 5.74; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.46-22.67; P = 0.012) and a longer postoperative length of hospitalization ( 6 vs 9 days , P < 0.001). The median interval between surgery and IASCs ( interquartile range) was 6 ( 4-22) days , and the IL-6 concentration was significantly different between patients with and without IASCs on PODs 1 , 3 , and 5. The ideal IL-6 cutoff value on POD 1 for the prediction of postoperative IASCs was 137.25 pg/mL , yielding a sensitivity of 81 % , specificity of 58 % , and area under the curve of 0.71 ( 95 % CI , 0.59-0.83) , with a negative predictive value of 0.93. A high IL-6 concentration on POD 1 is independently associated with the occurrence of postoperative IASCs in patients undergoing elective surgery for CD and could allow for earlier diagnosis and earlier intervention for IASCs compared with C-reactive protein.
