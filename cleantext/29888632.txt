  Objectives WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 ( WWP1) has been implicated in tumor progression. We aimed to investigate the role of WWP1 in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( CSCC). Methods WWP1 gene and protein levels were detected using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction , immunohistochemistry and western blotting. The effects of WWP1 on cell cycle , apoptosis , cell migration and invasion were examined by flow cytometry , wound<disease> healing and Transwell assays , respectively. The antitumor efficacy of WWP1 small interfering RNA was determined in CSCC tumor xenografts in mice. Results WWP1 expression was significantly higher in CSCC tissues and cells than in normal skin and cells , respectively. WWP1 expression was significantly associated with histological grade , invasion depth and lymph node metastasis in patients with CSCC. High expression predicted metastatic potential and an unfavorable prognosis. WWP1 downregulation suppressed tumor growth in vitro and in vivo , reduced cell migration and invasion , arrested the cell cycle in G0/G1 and induced apoptosis in A431 cells. WWP1 depletion also decreased phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3) , matrix metalloproteinase-2 , cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 , but did not affect total STAT3. Conclusions WWP1 is a potential target for the diagnosis , prognosis and therapy of patients with CSCC.
