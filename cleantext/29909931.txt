  Whenever possible , surgical removal of tumors should be pursued because this likely allows for the best possible outcome for a particular patient; however , this may not be pursued for various reasons. In those situations , interventional radiology ( IR) options can be considered as definitive therapy or palliation. Locoregional therapies such as intra-arterial chemotherapy and embolization/chemoembolization , while rarely reported in veterinary medicine , offer an alternative minimally invasive treatment option. In addition , drainage of body fluids or neoplastic effusions<symptom> can be established via IR means , and when tumors are not removed , but luminal patency needs to be reestablished , palliative stenting can also be performed.
