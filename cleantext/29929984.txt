  The actin-binding protein cortactin promotes the formation and maintenance of actin-rich structures , including lamellipodial protrusions in fibroblasts and neuronal dendritic spines. Cortactin cellular functions have been attributed to its activation of the Arp2/3 complex , which stimulates actin branch nucleation , and to its recruitment of Rho family GTPase regulators. Cortactin also binds actin filaments and significantly slows filament depolymerization , but the mechanism by which it does so , and the relationship between actin binding and stabilization , is unclear. Here , we elucidated the cortactin regions that are necessary and sufficient for actin filament binding and stabilization. Using actin cosedimentation assays , we found that the cortactin repeat region binds actin , but that the adjacent linker region is required for binding with the same affinity as full-length cortactin. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to measure rates of single filament actin depolymerization , we observed that cortactin-actin interactions are sufficient to stabilize actin filaments. Moreover , conserved charged residues in repeat 4 were necessary for high affinity actin binding , and substitution of these residues significantly impaired cortactin-mediated actin stabilization. Cortactin bound actin with higher affinity than did its paralog hematopoeitic cell-specific Lyn substrate 1 ( HS1) and the effects on actin stability were specific to cortactin. Finally , cortactin stabilized ADP-actin filaments , indicating that the stabilization mechanism does not depend on actin nucleotide state. Together , these results indicate that cortactin binding to actin is necessary and sufficient to stabilize filaments in a concentration-dependent manner , specific to conserved residues in the cortactin repeats , and independent of the actin nucleotide state.
