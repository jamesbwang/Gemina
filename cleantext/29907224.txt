  The patient-provider relationship ( PPR) is an important element of health care delivery and may influence patient outcomes. The objective of the present study was to identify clinical predictors of PPR among patients with hepatopancreatobiliary ( HPB) diseases and assess the association of PPR and health care utilization. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey database from 2008-2014 was used to identify adult patients with HPB diagnoses. A PPR score of `` poor , '' `` average , '' and `` optimal '' was calculated from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Survey. Predictors of poor PPR and the association of PPR and health care utilization were assessed. Among 592 patients , PPR was optimal ( 210 , 35.4 %) , average ( 270 , 45.5 %) , or poor ( 114 , 19.2 %). Patients without insurance ( 36.3 %) or with Medicaid ( 28.8 %) were more likely to report poor PPR versus patients with private insurance ( 14.0 %) or Medicare ( 15.4 %) ( P = 0.03). Poor<symptom> ( 24.3 %)- and low ( 21.5 %)- income patients were more likely to report poor PPR versus middle ( 12.8 %)- or high-income ( 14.0 %) patients ( P = 0.03). Poor<symptom> mental health was also more common among patients with poor PPR ( 13.4 %) versus average ( 5.4 %) or optimal ( 3.7 %) PPR ( P = 0.02) , and this association between poor PPR and poor mental health remained significant on multivariable analysis ( odds ratio ( OR) 2.43 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.20-4.92). Poor<symptom> PPR was associated with increased emergency room utilization on univariate ( OR 2.50 , 95 % CI 1.21-5.14) , but not multivariate ( OR 2.18 , 95 % CI 0.92-5.15) analysis. Among patients with HPB diseases , PPR was associated with insurance type , socioeconomic status , and mental health scores. Patients reporting poor PPR were more likely to be high utilizers of the emergency room. Efforts to improve the PPR are needed and should be focused on these high-risk populations.
