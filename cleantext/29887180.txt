  During the last few years , the number of patients receiving anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy has increased worldwide. Since this is a chronic treatment , patients receiving it can be expected to need some kind of surgery or intervention during their lifetime that may require treatment discontinuation. The decision to withdraw antithrombotic therapy depends on the patient 's thrombotic risk versus hemorrhagic risk. Assessment of both factors will show the precise management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy in these scenarios. The aim of this consensus document , coordinated by the Cardiovascular Thrombosis Working Group of the Spanish Society of Cardiology , and endorsed by most of the Spanish scientific societies of clinical specialities that may play a role in the patient-health care process during the perioperative or periprocedural period , is to recommend some simple and practical guidelines with a view to homogenizing daily clinical practice.
