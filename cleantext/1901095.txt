  Lysozymes act as important innate immunity molecule against various pathogen infections. In the present study , a new c-type and g-type lysozymes were isolated from rare minnow Gobiocypris rarus. The deduced amino acid sequence of c-type lysozyme contained 145 residues and possessed conserved catalytic residues ( Glu
