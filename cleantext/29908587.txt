  Viruses<pathogen> infect all kingdoms of marine life from bacteria to whales. Viruses in the world 's oceans play important roles in the mortality of phytoplankton , and as drivers of evolution and biogeochemical cycling. They shape host population abundance and distribution and can lead to the termination of algal blooms. As discoveries about this huge reservoir of genetic and biological diversity grow , our understanding of the major influences viruses exert in the global marine environment continues to expand. This chapter discusses the key discoveries that have been made to date about marine viruses and the current direction of this field of research.
