  Bacterial communities associated with insects can substantially influence host ecology , evolution and behaviour. Host diet is a key factor that shapes bacterial communities , but the impact of dietary transitions across insect development is poorly understood. We analysed bacterial communities of 12 butterfly species across different developmental stages , using amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Butterfly larvae typically consume leaves of a single host plant , whereas adults are more generalist nectar feeders. Thus , we expected bacterial communities to vary substantially across butterfly development. Surprisingly , only few species showed significant dietary and developmental transitions in bacterial communities , suggesting weak impacts of dietary transitions across butterfly development. On the other hand , bacterial communities were strongly influenced by butterfly species and family identity , potentially due to dietary and physiological variation across the host phylogeny. Larvae of most butterfly species largely mirrored bacterial community composition of their diets , suggesting passive acquisition rather than active selection. Overall , our results suggest that although butterflies harbour distinct microbiomes across taxonomic groups and dietary guilds , the dramatic dietary shifts that occur during development do not impose strong selection to maintain distinct bacterial communities across all butterfly hosts.
