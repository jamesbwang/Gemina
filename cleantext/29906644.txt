  Step-up therapy is the recommended therapy for infected necrotizing pancreatitis<disease> ( INP). However , the most appropriate secondary therapy for use after initial drainage has not been fully determined. This meta-analysis was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of retroperitoneal versus open intraperitoneal necrosectomy as part of a step-up strategy for INP. Eight online databases were searched for randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) and cohorts comparing retroperitoneal and open intraperitoneal step-up approaches for treating INP. The data was pooled with a random-effects model. A total of 21 controlled studies ( one RCT and twenty cohorts) and 2177 patients were included in this study. Our meta-analysis showed that the retroperitoneal group had a lower postoperative complication rate ( risk ratio ( RR) = 0.575 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.459 to 0.719 , P < 0.001) , lower postoperative mortality ( RR = 0.525 , 95 % CI = 0.430 to 0.642 , P < 0.001) , higher technical success rate ( RR = 1.313 , 95 % CI = 1.017 to 1.694 , P = 0.037) , similar surgical reintervention rate ( RR = 0.930 , 95 % CI = 0.783 to 1.106 , P = 0.411) , shorter operative time ( standardized mean difference ( SMD) = -2.402 , 95 % CI = -3.642 to -1.161 , P < 0.001) , and shorter hospital stay ( SMD = -2.034 , 95 % CI = -3.041 to -1.026 , P < 0.001) than the open group. These results were supported by a subgroup analysis. For treating INP , the retroperitoneal approach is safer and more effective than the open intraperitoneal approach.
