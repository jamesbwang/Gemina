  Temperature is a well-known environmental stress that influences both microbial metabolism and community structure in the biological wastewater treatment systems. In this study , responses of biological performance and sludge microbiota to the long-term day/night temperature differences ( DNTD) were investigated in membrane bioreactors ( MBRs). The results showed that the functional bacteria could sustained their ecological functions at low DNTD ( 20/30 °C) , resulting in relatively stable performance with respect to nutrient removal. However , when the activated sludge was subjected to a high DNTD ( 17/33 °C) , the effluent concentrations of COD , TN and TP were significantly higher in MBR-B than that in MBR-A. In addition , more severe membrane fouling occurred under the perturbation of high DNTD as revealed by the transmembrane pressure ( TMP) profile , which was mainly attributed to the accumulation of extracellular polymeric substances ( EPS). The results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that DNTD showed negligible effect on the bacterial community structures. Nonetheless , the functional bacteria responded differently to DNTD , which were in accordance with the bioreactor performances. Specifically , Nitrospina ( NOB) and Tetrasphaera ( PAOs) appeared to be sensitive to both low and high DNTD. In contrast , a low DNTD showed marginal effects on the denitrifiers , while a high DNTD significantly decreased their abundances. More strikingly , filamentous bulking bacteria were found to be well-adapted to DNTD , indicating their tolerance to the daily temperature fluctuation. This study will advance our knowledge regarding the response of microbial ecology of activated sludge to daily temperature variations in full-scale MBRs.
