  CT is the gold standard for visualizing renal and ureteral calculi. CT three-dimensional reformatting allows for automatic , accurate , and reliable measurement of stone size , volume , density , and location. In this study , we aimed to develop and test a software platform capable of calculating a battery of clinically important urinary stone parameters at the point-of-care ( POC). The syngo Calcium Scoring ( Siemens Corporation) algorithm was modified to identify calcium-based stones using an attenuation threshold ( 250 HU) within a region of interest. Information automatically obtained after reconstruction included voxel sum and calculated volume , maximum diameter , largest diameter in the x , y , and z planes , cumulative diameter , distribution of attenuation in HU , and position relative to the skin for calculation of the skin-to-stone distance ( SSD). This algorithm was packaged into a stand-alone application ( MATLAB 9.1). From April 2017 to May 2017 , all patients undergoing a noncontrast CT of the abdomen or the abdomen and pelvis at the Johns Hopkins Hospital were eligible for inclusion in this validation cohort. A total of 55 index renal stones were included. The mean volume calculated by voxel sum was 216.53 mm We developed a stand-alone platform with a simple easy-to-use interface , which will allow any user the ability to calculate a battery of clinically important urinary stone parameters from CT imaging at the POC. This program is now freely available online.
