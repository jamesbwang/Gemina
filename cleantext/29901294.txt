  To investigate the functional state of the upper urinary tract in patients undergoing autoplastic surgery for a hydronophrosis of the intrarenal pelvis. The study comprised 78 patients with the intrarenal pelvis and impaired urinary outflow due to stricture of the ureteropelvic junction and vascular conflict ( interatrial and arteriovenous narrowing) , who underwent pyeloplasty using autologous tunica vaginalis<pathogen>. All patients underwent an incision of ureteropelvic stricture and resection of the parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis<pathogen> which was used to repair the obstruction site and internal stenting of the upper urinary tract. The patients were examined at baseline and during follow-up ranging from 3 months to 3 years. At three months after surgery , there was a decrease in the size of the renal pelvis and calyces with an improvement of all parameters of uro- and hemodynamics. At three years after surgery , the structural and functional parameters of the upper urinary tract were completely restored. Obstructive uropathy , resulting from the intrarenal pelvis , leads to persistently impaired urinary outflow from the upper urinary tract. Surgical intervention is the only curative treatment able to restore the urinary flow. In men with the intrarenal pelvis , the autoplastic surgery of the ureteropelvic junction obstruction using a parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis<pathogen> is an effective surgical modality improving renal pelvis capacity and contributing to the recovery of urinary outflow from the upper urinary tract.
