  Abnormal maternal lipid profiles , a hallmark of increased maternal adiposity , are associated with pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes , and offspring long-term metabolic health is impacted as the consequence of altered fetal growth , physiology and often iatrogenic prematurity. The metabolic changes associated with maternal obesity and/or the consumption of a high-fat diet effecting maternal lipid profiles and metabolism have also been documented to specifically affect placental function and may underlie changes in fetal development and life course disease risk. The placenta plays a critical role in mediating nutritional signals between the fetus and the mother. As obesity rates in women of reproductive age continue to increase , it is becoming evident that inclusion of new technologies that allow for a better understanding of early changes in placental lipid transport and metabolism , non-invasively in maternal circulation , maternal tissues , placenta , fetal circulation and fetal tissues are needed to aid timely clinical diagnosis and treatment for obesity-associated diseases. This review describes pregnancy lipid homeostasis , with specific reference to changes arising from altered maternal body composition on placental and fetal lipid transport and metabolism. Current technologies for lipid assessments , such as metabolomics and lipidomics may be impacted by labour or mode of delivery and are only reflective of a single time point. This review further addresses how established and novel technologies for assessing lipids and their metabolism non-invasively and during the course of pregnancy may guide future research into the effect of maternal metabolic health on pregnancy outcome , placenta and fetus.
