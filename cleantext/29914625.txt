  It is suggested that vitamin D level and age at menarche are related to each other , and the prevalence of low vitamin D status and early menarche in women is increasing worldwide. Moreover , several studies revealed that both of them are associated with metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS). Therefore , we hypothesized that there are significant associations among vitamin D status , age at menarche , and MetS and that the relationships differ according to menstrual state. We assessed whether the association among MetS , vitamin D , and menarche age is different between premenopausal and postmenopausal women and whether there is a change in risk of MetS according to vitamin D level in different age-at-menarche groups. We used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , using 1:1 age-matching for this cross-sectional study. Individuals were stratified into 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D levels ( deficient , < 10 ng/mL; insufficient , 10-19 ng/mL; and sufficient , ≥ 20 ng/mL) and categorized as having either early , average , or late menarche ( < 13 , 13-16 , and ≥ 17 years). In premenopausal women , early menarche , not vitamin D level , was associated with risk of MetS ( odds ratio ( 95 % confidence interval) , 1.65 ( 1.18-2.33)). In contrast , in postmenopausal women , vitamin D deficiency , not age at menarche , was associated with risk of MetS ( 1.39 ( 1.03-1.87)). In a stratified analysis regarding interactions of a change in risk of MetS according to vitamin D level in different ages at menarche , vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with the risk of MetS ( 1.36 ( 1.01-1.86)) , but this was only in the average-age-at-menarche group. This study suggests that the time of entry into puberty for women may be an important factor in the development of MetS in adulthood , and vitamin D status in women at average menarche age may contribute to the development of MetS.
