  Tracing the fate of pathogens in environmental water , particularly in wastewater , with a suitable methodology is a demanding task. We investigated the fate of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> K12 in sewage influent and activated sludge using a novel approach that involves the application of a biologically stable dialysis device. The ion concentrations inside the device could reach that of surrounding solution when it was incubated in phosphate buffered saline for 2 h. E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> K12 above 10
