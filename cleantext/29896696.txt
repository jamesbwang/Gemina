  Prenatal exposure to various environmental teratogens such as drugs , toxins , and infectious etiologies results in a wide range of developmental abnormalities , including growth deficiency , developmental delay , structural defects , functional CNS abnormalities , and fetal death. Here , we describe the use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for investigating teratogenic effects on embryonic development.
