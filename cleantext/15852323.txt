  Family-Based Treatment ( FBT) is the first line of care in paediatric treatment while adult programs focus on individualized models of care. Transition age youth ( TAY) with Anorexia<symptom> Nervosa ( AN) are in a unique life stage and between systems of care. As such , they and their caregivers may benefit from specialized , developmentally tailored models of treatment. The primary purpose of this study was to assess if parental self-efficacy and caregiver accommodation changed in caregivers during the course of FBT-TAY for AN. The secondary aim was to determine if changes in parental self-efficacy and caregiver accommodation contributed to improvements in eating disorder behaviour and weight restoration in the transition age youth with AN. Twenty-six participants ( ages 16-22) and 39 caregivers were recruited. Caregivers completed the Parents versus Anorexia<symptom> Scale and Accommodation and Enabling Scale for Eating Disorders at baseline , end-of-treatment ( EOT) , and 3 months follow-up. Unbalanced repeated measures designs for parental self-efficacy and caregiver accommodation towards illness behaviours were conducted using generalized estimation equations. Parental self-efficacy increased from baseline to EOT , although not significantly ( Our findings demonstrate , albeit preliminary at this stage , that FBT-TAY promotes positive increases in parental self-efficacy and assists caregivers in decreasing their accommodation to illness behaviours for transition age youth with AN. However , changes in the parental factors did not influence changes in eating and weight in the transition age youth.
