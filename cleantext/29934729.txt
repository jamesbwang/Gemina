  In this study , functional near-infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS) was used to examine the brain activation and connectivity in occipitotemporal cortex during Chinese character recognition ( CCR). Eighteen healthy participants were recruited to perform a well-designed task with three categories of stimuli ( real characters , pseudo characters , and checkerboards). By inspecting the brain activation difference and its relationship with behavioral data , the left laterality during CCR was clearly identified in the Brodmann area ( BA) 18 and 19. In addition , our novel findings also demonstrated that the bilateral superior temporal gyrus ( STG) , bilateral BA 19 , and left fusiform gyrus were also involved in high-level lexical information processing such as semantic and phonological ones. Meanwhile , by examining functional brain networks , we discovered that the right BA 19 exhibited enhanced brain connectivity. In particular , the connectivity in the right fusiform gyrus , right BA 19 , and left STG showed significant correlation with the performance of CCR. Consequently , the combination of fNIRS technique with functional network analysis paves a new avenue for improved understanding of the cognitive mechanism underlying CCR.
