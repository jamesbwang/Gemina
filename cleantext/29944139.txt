  In recent years , biological floating bed technology has been applied increasingly in aquaculture ponds. In this study we developed a novel floating bed made from ceramsite and studied its effect on water quality , phytoplankton , bacteria and fish growth. Water quality was effectively regulated and controlled in ceramsite floating bed ( CFB) ponds with an average transparency of 23.18 cm , ammonia<pathogen> nitrogen ( NH
