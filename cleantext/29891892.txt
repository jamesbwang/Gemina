  High-temperature alloys are crucial to many important technologies that underpin our civilization. All these materials rely on forming an external oxide layer ( scale) for corrosion protection. Despite decades of research on oxide scale growth , many open questions remain , including the crucial role of the so-called reactive elements and water. Here , we reveal the hitherto unknown interplay between reactive elements and water during alumina scale growth , causing a metastable ` messy ' nano-structured alumina layer to form. We propose that reactive-element-decorated , hydroxylated interfaces between alumina nanograins enable water to access an inner cathode in the bottom of the scale , at odds with the established scale growth scenario. As evidence , hydride-nanodomains and reactive element/hydrogen ( deuterium) co-variation are observed in the alumina scale. The defect-rich alumina subsequently recrystallizes to form a protective scale. First-principles modelling is also performed to validate the RE effect. Our findings open up promising avenues in oxidation research and suggest ways to improve alloy properties.
