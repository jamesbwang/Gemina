  The MEESSI scale stratifies acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( AHF) patients at the emergency department ( ED) according to the 30-day mortality risk. We validated the MEESSI risk score in a new cohort of Spanish patients to assess its accuracy in stratifying patients by risk and to compare its performance in different settings. We included consecutive patients diagnosed with AHF in 30 EDs during January and February 2016. The MEESSI score was calculated for each patient. The c-statistic measured the discriminatory capacity to predict 30-day mortality of the full MEESSI model and secondary models. Further comparisons were made among subgroups of patients from university and community hospitals , EDs with high- , medium- or low-activity and EDs that recruited or not patients in the original MEESSI derivation cohort. We analyzed 4711 patients ( university/community hospitals: 3811/900; high-/ medium-/ low-activity EDs: 2695/1479/537; EDs participating/not participating in the previous MEESSI derivation study: 3892/819). The distribution of patients according to the MEESSI risk categories was: 1673 ( 35.5 %) low risk , 2023 ( 42.9 %) intermediate risk , 530 ( 11.3 %) high risk and 485 ( 10.3 %) very high risk , with 30-day mortality of 2.0 % , 7.8 % , 17.9 % , and 41.4 % , respectively. The c-statistic for the full model was 0.810 ( 95 % CI , 0.790-0.830) , ranging from 0.731 to 0.785 for the subsequent secondary models. The discriminatory capacity of the MEESSI risk score was similar among subgroups of hospital type , ED activity , and original recruiter EDs. The MEESSI risk score successfully stratifies AHF patients at the ED according to the 30-day mortality risk , potentially helping clinicians in the decision-making process for hospitalizing patients.
