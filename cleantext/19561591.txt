  MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) have been proven to regulate gene expression at the protein translation level. miRNA abnormal expression has been associated with the development of lung cancer. In the present study , we aimed to investigate the mechanism of miR-196 in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). The miR-196b and GATA-6 ( GATA6) expression levels were examined in NSCLC by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Transwell assay was used to assess cell migration and invasion. Moreover , the specific target of miR-196b in NSCLC was verified by the luciferase reporter assay. The expression of miR-196b was higher in both NSCLC tissues and cells than the normal levels. Specifically , the miR-196b mimic group in NSCLC cells markedly promoted cell migration and invasion , while the miR-196b inhibitor group exhibited the opposite effect. Furthermore , GATA6 was verified as a specific target of miR-196b in NSCLC cells and GATA6 could attenuate the migratory and invasive ability of NSCLC cells regulated by miR-196b. In addition , the relationship between GATA6 and miR-196b expression was negatively correlated in NSCLC tissues. Thus , miR-196b enhanced NSCLC cell migration and invasion via the downregulation of GATA6 , indicating its potential application in NSCLC diagnosis and therapy.
