  Eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE) is often detected in children and is considered to be a rare disease , with prevalence values reported to be below 60 cases per 100,000 persons. To determine whether the incidence of EoE in children in Utah exceeds estimates from regional reports , we calculated incidence and prevalence values over a 5-year period. Using consensus guidelines for the diagnosis of EoE , we reviewed pathology records from in the Intermountain Healthcare pathology database , from July 1 , 2011 through June 31 , 2016. We collected data on 10,619 pediatric patients with available esophageal biopsy results , and identified cases of esophageal eosinophilia ( > 14 eosinophils in a high-power microscopy field in an endoscopic biopsy). An EoE case required the presence of esophageal eosinophilia , symptoms of esophageal dysfunction , and the absence of co-morbid conditions that cause esophageal eosinophilia. Annual pediatric EoE incidence and prevalence values were calculated per 100,000 children , based on averaged pediatric population estimates from census figures of Utah in 2010 and 2016. We identified 1281 unique pediatric patients who met criteria for esophageal eosinophilia. Of those , 1060 patients met criteria for newly diagnosed EoE. Over the 5-year period studied , the average annual pediatric EoE incidence in Utah was 24 cases per 100,000 children. The prevalence in year 5 of the study was 118 cases per 100,000 children. In a population-based study of children in Utah , we found the incidence and prevalence of pediatric EoE to be higher than previously reported. This could be due to the prominence of EoE risk factors in this region , as well as Utah 's searchable medical record system that allows for reliable case ascertainment. Further studies of this type could increase disease awareness , prompting early referral to pediatric gastroenterologists and trials to strengthen evidence-based , algorithmic approaches to EoE diagnosis and treatment in children.
