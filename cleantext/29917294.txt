  The aim of the study was to examine mucosal saliva and unstimulated ( UWS) and stimulated ( SWS) whole saliva secretion rates and associated factors , in 56 female patients diagnosed with BMS and age-matched control women. Mucosal saliva was assessed using the Periotron The patients with BMS displayed less lingual and whole saliva , and more hyposalivation , xerostomia diseases/disorders and drug usage , compared to the controls. Only a low SWS and xerostomia differed after adjusting for drugs and systemic<disease> diseases<disease>. Regression analyses suggested an importance of saliva affecting drugs for saliva on the tongue and for SWS , and the total number of drugs used for UWS. Lingual saliva and UWS were also associated with systemic<disease> diseases<disease> in the patients. Xerostomia was significantly associated with drug use and whole saliva for all subjects but not in separate analyses of the groups. Less saliva in patients with BMS could be related to more systemic<disease> diseases<disease> and medication and not to the syndrome<disease> per se. Xerostomia in the patients was not related to any of these factors.
