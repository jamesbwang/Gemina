  The study of interaction mechanism between chrysin and leptin was investigated by various spectroscopic techniques and atom force microscope. The ultraviolet spectrum presents a red shift in 200-220 nm after chrysin upon. And there is a structure alternative showed in 270 nm when the concentration ratio of chrysin and leptin in 10-15. From the fluorescence spectrum , it was found that chrysin could combine with leptin in physiological condition. The binding constant ( Ka) values , at 298 K and 310 K , were ( 0.41 ± 0.05) × 10 ⁶ and ( 3.26 ± 0.46) × 10 ⁶ L · mol ⁻¹ , and the binding site number were 1.02 ± 0.04 and 0.51 ± 0.01 , respectively. The atom force microscope results showed that the dimension of leptin molecules became more swollen after binding with chrysin because of the hydrophobicity. These results demonstrate that the mechanism of chrysin and leptin interaction could play a role in leptin adjust in human body , and it could provide a new aspect for the study of obesity treatment.
