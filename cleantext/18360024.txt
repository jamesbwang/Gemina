  The efficacy of a combination of a calcium channel blocker ( CCB) plus chlorthalidone ( diuretic) versus a CCB plus an angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB) in patients not responding to CCB monotherapy has not been evaluated previously. We plan to compare the efficacy and safety of S-amlodipine ( CCB) plus chlorthalidone versus S-amlodipine plus telmisartan ( ARB) combinations among hypertension patients unresponsive to amlodipine monotherapy. This study is a prospective , randomized , double-blind , multicenter , parallel , non-inferiority phase 4 study. Hypertension patients who have been treated with amlodipine ( 5 mg) or S-amlodipine ( 2.5 mg) monotherapy for â‰¥ 2 weeks and whose mean diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( DBP) is greater than 90 mmHg will be randomized to either S-amlodipine ( 2.5 mg) plus chlorthalidone ( 25 mg) or S-amlodipine ( 2.5 mg) plus telmisartan ( 40 mg) therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint is mean sitting DBP change after 12 weeks of treatment. The study objective is to prove the non-inferiority of the former combination ( test drug) as compared to the latter one ( control) with a non-inferiority margin of 3 mmHg in mean DBP change. The secondary endpoints are 6-week DBP change , 6- and 12-week sitting systolic BP ( SBP) change , and the attainment of the target BP ( SBP < 140 mmHg or DBP < 90 mmHg). Urine albumin , albumin/creatinine ratio ( ACR) , pulse wave velocity , central BP , 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring , and body fluid composition analysis will be performed at each hospital 's discretion. The sample size was estimated as 170 in total with 1:1 randomization. This is the first study comparing the efficacy of a CCB plus chlorthalidone versus a CCB plus an ARB in patients who are not responding to CCB single therapy. The study result will help clinicians to choose between chlorthalidone and telmisartan in CCB-unresponsive patients. ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03226340. Registered on 2 December 2015.
