  Quorum sensing ( QS) , where bacteria secrete and respond to chemical signals to coordinate population-wide behaviors , has revealed that bacteria are highly social. Here , we investigate how diversity in QS signals and receptors can modify social interactions controlled by the QS system regulating bacteriocin secretion in Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , encoded by the blp operon ( bacteriocin-like peptide). Analysis of 4096 pneumococcal genomes detected nine blp QS signals ( BlpC) and five QS receptor groups ( BlpH). Imperfect concordance between signals and receptors suggested widespread social interactions between cells , specifically eavesdropping ( where cells respond to signals that they do not produce) and crosstalk ( where cells produce signals that non-clones detect). This was confirmed in vitro by measuring the response of reporter strains containing six different blp QS receptors to cognate and non-cognate peptides. Assays between pneumococcal colonies grown adjacent to one another provided further evidence that crosstalk and eavesdropping occur at endogenous levels of signal secretion. Finally , simulations of QS strains producing bacteriocins revealed that eavesdropping can be evolutionarily beneficial even when the affinity for non-cognate signals is very weak. Our results highlight that social interactions can mediate intraspecific competition among bacteria and reveal that competitive interactions can be modified by polymorphic QS systems.
