  Phospholipid nanoparticles ( PNs) encapsulating vitamin C and E derivatives , 3-O-cetyl ascorbic acid ( CA) and tocopherol acetate ( TA) , respectively , were examined using the film rehydration and extrusion method. PN formulations ( TA-Cassome) were prepared by mixing CA , soya phosphatidylcholine ( Soya PC) , sodium cholate , and TA at a molar ratio of 20/80/5/ 6. Glycerol ( GL) or diglycerol ( DG) were also added to improve the skin accumulation of CA and TA. Three TA-Cassome formulations were evaluated using a dynamic light scattering ( DLS) , NMR , TEM , skin accumulation test for CA and TA , and small-angle X-ray diffraction ( SAXD) analysis. TA-Cassome formulations ( 150 nm) were stable for two weeks and they encapsulated 1.8 mg/mL of TA. TEM and SAXD analysis revealed that the nanoparticles formed a spherical multilayer structure.
