  Objective To investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of Nd: YAG laser anterior capsulotomy for the treatment of anterior capsular phimosis. Methods We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive case series of Nd: YAG laser anterior capsulotomy in patients with anterior capsular phimosis , who were treated between November 2012 and April 2014. Data collected included risk factors , interval between surgery and capsulotomy , best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) , and diameter of anterior capsule opening before and after Nd: YAG laser anterior capsulotomy. Results Eleven eyes of 11 patients were included in the study. The mean follow-up time was 30.1 ± 4.5 months ( range: 26-42 months). At the last follow-up , the mean diameter of the anterior capsule opening was 5.1 ± 0.2 mm , which was significantly greater than the diameter before laser capsulotomy ( 2.2 ± 0.8 mm). BCVA remained stable or improved in nine eyes ( 81.8 %) following capsulotomy. No patients experienced recurrence of phimosis. Conclusions In a long-term study of > 2 years , we found that Nd: YAG laser anterior capsulotomy is safe and effective for the treatment of anterior capsule phimosis.
