  A new and efficient synthesis of tetracyclic phenanthridines and benzo ( c) chromenes has been described involving a metal-mediated two-step domino strategy. The first step involved efficient palladium-catalyzed domino carbopalladation/cross coupling , and the second step involved iron-catalyzed domino isomerization/cyclodehydration. The important features of this strategy include high yields , generality , wide substrate scope , and broad functional group tolerance. A plausible mechanism has been proposed to explain the formation of the product.
