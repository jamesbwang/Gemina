  The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the ability of an electronic nose ( e-nose) to distinguish malignant gastric histology from healthy controls in exhaled breath. In a period of 3 weeks , all preoperative gastric carcinoma ( GC) patients ( n = 16) in the Beijing Oncology Hospital were asked to participate in the study. The control group ( n = 28) consisted of family members screened by endoscopy and healthy volunteers. The e-nose consists of 3 sensors with which volatile organic compounds in the exhaled air react. Real-time analysis takes place within the e-nose , and binary data are exported and interpreted by an artificial neuronal network. This is a self-learning computational system. The inclusion rate of the study was 100 %. Baseline characteristics differed significantly only for age: the average age of the patient group was 57 years and that of the healthy control group 37 years ( P value = .000). Weight<symptom> loss<symptom> was the only significant different symptom ( P value = .040). A total of 16 patients and 28 controls were included; 13 proved to be true positive and 20 proved to be true negative. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed a sensitivity of 81 % and a specificity of 71 % , with an accuracy of 75 %. These results give a positive predictive value of 62 % and a negative predictive value of 87 %. This pilot study shows that the e-nose has the capability of diagnosing GC based on exhaled air , with promising predictive values for a screening purpose.
