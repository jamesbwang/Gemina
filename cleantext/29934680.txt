  On 1 January 2018 , a new Maternity Protection Act came into force in Germany. The Maternity Protection Act has been made more appropriate and coherent by the reform. In addition , the regulations on maternity protection have been structured better and made clearer. The aim of the law remains to ensure a responsible balance<symptom> between health protection for a pregnant or breastfeeding woman and her ( unborn) child on the one hand and the self-determined decision of the woman about her employment on the other. To improve the effectiveness of the law in this sense , the hazards of a modern working world for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers and the duties of maternity protection had to be better contoured. It will improve women 's opportunities and strengthen their rights to pursue their careers during pregnancy and breastfeeding without compromising their health and that of their child. The reform should ensure a uniform level of health protection during pregnancy , after delivery and during breastfeeding for all women , regardless of occupational group. In particular , the protection of breastfeeding women secured by the Maternity Protection Act is described in more detail in this article.
