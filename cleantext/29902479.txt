  We previously confirmed that postprandial alterations in the circulation and metabolism after a single oral dose of flavan 3-ols ( mixture of catechin and catechin oligomers) were involved in an increase in sympathetic nervous activity. However , it is well known that , in response to various stresses , activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA) axis occurs together with sympathetic nerve activity , which is associated with activation of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary ( SAM) axis. In this study , we examined whether the HPA axis was activated after a single dose of flavan 3-ols. We administered an oral dose of 10 or 50 mg/kg flavan 3-ols to male ICR mice , removed the brains , and fixed them in paraformaldehyde-phosphate buffer. Other animals that were treated similarly were decapitated , and blood was collected. In the paraventricular nucleus ( PVN) , c-fos mRNA expression increased significantly at 15 min after administration of either 10 or 50 mg/kg flavan 3-ols. Corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH) mRNA expression levels significantly increased at 240 min after administration of 10 mg/kg flavan 3-ols , and at 60 min after administration of 50 mg/kg flavan 3-ols. Plasma corticosterone levels were also significantly increased at 240 min after ingestion of 50 mg/kg flavan 3-ols. In this experiment , we confirmed that the ingestion of flavan 3-ols acted as a stressor in mammals with activation both the SAM and HPA axes.
