  Forming solid solutions , as an effective strategy to improve thermoelectric performance , has a dilemma that alloy scattering will reduce both the thermal conductivity and carrier mobility. Here , an intuitive way is proposed to decouple the opposite effects , that is , using lanthanide contraction as a design factor to select alloying atoms with large mass fluctuation but small radius difference from the host atoms. Typical half-Heusler alloys , n-type ( Zr , Hf) NiSn and p-type ( Nb , Ta) FeSb solid solutions , are taken as paradigms to attest the validity of this design strategy , which exhibit greatly suppressed lattice thermal conductivity and maintained carrier mobility. Furthermore , by considering lanthanide contraction , n-type ( Zr , Hf) CoSb-based alloys with high zT of â‰ˆ 1.0 are developed. These results highlight the significance of lanthanide contraction as a design factor in enhancing the thermoelectric performance and reveal the practical potential of ( Zr , Hf) CoSb-based half-Heusler compounds due to the matched n-type and p-type thermoelectric performance.
