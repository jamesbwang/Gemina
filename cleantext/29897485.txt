  Current chemistry analyzers measure ion concentration using ion- selective electrodes; however , may differ in the specific technology at the bedside versus the central laboratory. Instruments utilized for point-of-care testing ( POCT) at the bedside use direct ion-selective electrodes , whereas central-laboratory analyzers use indirect ion-selective electrodes. Under most circumstances , these instruments will deliver the same result; however , various substances can cause interferences in one or the other. An 18-year-old Hispanic woman with a history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP) presented at Children 's National Medical Center ( CNMC) with a severe<symptom> headache<symptom> and required intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG) therapy. Because a discrepancy developed between her point-of-care and central-laboratory sodium values , another instrument was used to retest the central-laboratory plasma specimens. The results were more in agreement with those from the point-of-care instrument and revealed a unique interference in sodium measurement related to IVIG use.
