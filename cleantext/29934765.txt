  The aim of the study was to test whether or not the arteriovenous oxygen concentration difference ( avDO A re-analysis involving six publications dealing with kinetic analysis was utilized with an overall sample size of 69 participants. All studies comprised an identical pseudorandom binary sequence work rate ( WR) protocol-WR changes between 30 and 80 W-to analyze the kinetic responses of pulmonary ( ( Formula: see text)) and muscle ( ( Formula: see text)) oxygen uptake kinetics as well as those of avDO A significant difference between ( Formula: see text) ( 0.395 ± 0.079) and ( Formula: see text) kinetics ( 0.330 ± 0.078) was observed ( p < 0.001) , where the variables showed a significant relationship ( r It is suggested that neither avDO
