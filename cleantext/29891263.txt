  Prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI) is part of the usual treatment in most patients with small-cell lung cancer ( SCLC) and response after treatment of the primary tumor. Clinical evidence suggests that radiation dose received by the hippocampus during whole brain radiotherapy might play a role in radiation-induced neurocognitive decline. This study is a multicenter phase III trial ( NCT02397733) randomizing SCLC patients after informed consent , to receive standard PCI treatment or PCI with hippocampus avoidance ( PCI-HA) by using intensity modulated radiation therapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy. The primary objective is assessment of hippocampus-dependent memory functioning and safety after PCI with or without hippocampus sparing by the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test. Secondary objectives are assessment of other neurotoxicity/quality of life , radiological brain abnormalities on magnetic resonance images , and evaluation of the incidence and location of brain metastases after PCI-HA compared with standard PCI. The originally planned sample size ( n = 150) has been calculated to detect a 50 % difference in the 3-month delayed recall score between the 2 treatment arms , with a statistical power of 80 % ( β = 20 %) and a significance level of 5 % ( α = 5 %) , with a maximum loss to follow-up of 10 %. This study is an important step in introducing a new therapeutic approach to patients with SCLC candidates for PCI.
