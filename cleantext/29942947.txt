  Atomic layer deposition ( ALD) of TiO2 shells on MoO3 nanobelts ( denote as TiO2@MoO3) is realized using a home-made ALD system , which allows a controllable hydrolysis reaction of TiCl4-H2O on an atomic scale. When used as an anode material for lithium ion batteries , the TiO2@MoO3 electrode demonstrates much enhanced lithium storage performance including higher specific capacity , better cycling stability and rate capability.
