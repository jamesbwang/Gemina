  Three morphologies ( octahedral , hierarchical and rhombic dodecahedral) of crystal Cu ₂ O with different facets ( ( 111) , ( 111)/ ( 110) , and ( 110)) incorporating graphene sheets ( denoted as o-Cu ₂ O-G , h-Cu ₂ O-G and r-Cu ₂ O-G , respectively) have been fabricated by using simple solution-phase techniques. Among these photocatalysts , the r-Cu ₂ O-G possesses the best photocatalytic performance of 98 % removal efficiency of methyl orange ( MO) with outstanding kinetics for 120 min of visible light irradiation. This enhancement is mainly due to the dangling & ldquo; Cu & rdquo; atoms in the highly active ( 110) facets , resulting in the increased adsorption of negatively charged MO.. More importantly , the unique interfacial structures of Cu ₂ O rhombic dodecahedra connected to graphene nanosheets can not only decrease the recombination of electron-hole pairs but also stabilize the crystal structure of Cu ₂ O , as verified by a series of spectroscopic analyses ( e.g. , X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM)). The effective photocatalysts developed in this work could be applied to the efficient decolorization of negatively charged organic dyes by employing solar energy.
