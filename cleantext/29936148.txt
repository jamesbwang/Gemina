  Olfactory dysfunction is common in Alzheimer 's disease- and Lewy body-related disorders , but its neural correlates have not been clearly elucidated. We retrospectively recruited 237 patients with Alzheimer 's disease-related cognitive impairment ( ADCI) and 217 with Lewy body-related cognitive impairment ( LBCI). They were identically evaluated using the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test , neuropsychological tests , and brain magnetic resonance imaging. LBCI had more severe olfactory dysfunction than ADCI. Patients with more severe cognitive dysfunction had worse olfactory function in both groups. In ADCI , lower Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test scores correlated with a lower cortical thickness in brain regions typically affected in Alzheimer 's disease , most prominently in the right parahippocampal cortex , whereas in LBCI , the scores correlated with white matter abnormalities in regions vulnerable to Lewy body , including subcortical regions of the orbitofrontal and frontoparietal cortices. Our results suggest that cortical atrophy in ADCI and white matter abnormalities in LBCI play important roles in olfactory dysfunction.
