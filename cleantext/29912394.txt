  Experimental and epidemiological studies suggest a protective role for vitamin D in colorectal carcinogenesis , but evidence is inconclusive. Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D concentrations that minimize risk are unknown. Current Institute of Medicine ( IOM) vitamin D guidance is based solely on bone health. We pooled participant-level data from 17 cohorts , comprising 5706 colorectal cancer case participants and 7107 control participants with a wide range of circulating 25 ( OH) D concentrations. For 30.1 % of participants , 25 ( OH) D was newly measured. Previously measured 25 ( OH) D was calibrated to the same assay to permit estimating risk by absolute concentrations. Study-specific relative risks ( RRs) for prediagnostic season-standardized 25 ( OH) D concentrations were calculated using conditional logistic regression and pooled using random effects models. Compared with the lower range of sufficiency for bone health ( 50- < 62.5 nmol/L) , deficient 25 ( OH) D ( < 30 nmol/L) was associated with 31 % higher colorectal cancer risk ( RR = 1.31 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.05 to 1.62); 25 ( OH) D above sufficiency ( 75- < 87.5 and 87.5- < 100 nmol/L) was associated with 19 % ( RR = 0.81 , 95 % CI = 0.67 to 0.99) and 27 % ( RR = 0.73 , 95 % CI = 0.59 to 0.91) lower risk , respectively. At 25 ( OH) D of 100 nmol/L or greater , risk did not continue to decline and was not statistically significantly reduced ( RR = 0.91 , 95 % CI = 0.67 to 1.24 , 3.5 % of control participants). Associations were minimally affected when adjusting for body mass index , physical activity , or other risk factors. For each 25 nmol/L increment in circulating 25 ( OH) D , colorectal cancer risk was 19 % lower in women ( RR = 0.81 , 95 % CI = 0.75 to 0.87) and 7 % lower in men ( RR = 0.93 , 95 % CI = 0.86 to 1.00) ( two-sided Pheterogeneity by sex = .008). Associations were inverse in all subgroups , including colorectal subsite , geographic region , and season of blood collection. Higher circulating 25 ( OH) D was related to a statistically significant , substantially lower colorectal cancer risk in women and non-statistically significant lower risk in men. Optimal 25 ( OH) D concentrations for colorectal cancer risk reduction , 75-100 nmol/L , appear higher than current IOM recommendations.
