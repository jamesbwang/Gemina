  The rise in opioid-related harms is an issue of increasing public health importance in Canada. This analysis used data from the Hospital Morbidity Database and the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System to determine the number of opioid poisoning<disease> hospitalizations and emergency department visits in Canada. Opioid poisoning<disease> hospitalizations have increased over the past 10 years , reaching 15.6 per 100 000 population in 2016/17. Emergency department visits due to opioid poisoning<disease> have also increased in Alberta and Ontario , the two provinces that collect emergency department data at the level of detail required for this analysis. These findings highlight the importance of pan- Canadian surveillance of opioid-related harms , as well as the need for evidence-based policies to help reduce these harms.
