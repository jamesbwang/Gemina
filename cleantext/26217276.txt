  Many studies have proved that color represents a variety of emotionally meaningful information. Researchers have proposed that context information endows colors with different associated meanings , and elicits corresponding behavior. Others have contended that the color red intensifies the stimulus ' existing valence or motivation tendency in the early processing step. The present study attempts to incorporate these two effects of the color red to explore their differences in a dot probe task , using event-related potential ( ERP). Our ERP results indicate that the color red intensifies the initial attention to emotion-congruent conditions , as indicated by the P1 component. However , the colors red and green lead to sustained attention to the expression of anger and happiness , respectively , but not fear , as shown by the late positive complex component ( all results are available at: https://osf.io/k3b8c/). This study found the different processing stages of the effect of the color red during attentional processing in a discrete emotional context , using ERPs , and may refine the Color-in-Context theory.
