  Acute kidney injury ( AKI) is a common occurrence after pediatric cardiac surgery. Plasma syndecan-1 is a biomarker of endothelial glycocalyx damage and it is associated with AKI. Syndecan-1 is also expressed in renal tubular cells but there is no study evaluating urinary syndecan-1 in predicting AKI. Prospective cohort study with 86 patients â‰¤ 18 years submitted to cardiac surgery at one reference institution. Postoperative urinary syndecan-1 was collected within the first 2 h after cardiac surgery. Severe AKI- defined according to KDIGO as stage 2 or 3- doubling of serum creatinine from the preoperative value or need for dialysis during hospitalization was the main outcome. Analyses were adjusted for clinical cofounders. Postoperative urinary syndecan-1 levels were higher in patients with severe AKI and even after adjustment for several clinical variables; the fourth quartile was significantly associated with severe AKI. The AUC-ROC for postoperative urinary syndecan-1 showed good discriminatory capacity ( AUC-ROC = 0.793). The addition of urinary syndecan-1 improved the discrimination capacity of a clinical model ( 0.78 to 0.84). It also improved risk prediction , as measured by net reclassification improvement ( NRI). Urinary syndecan-1 predicts severe AKI after pediatric cardiac surgery. Moreover , it appears to add capacity to predict severe AKI into a clinical model.
