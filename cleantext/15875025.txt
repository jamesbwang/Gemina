  The establishment of pregnancy is a complex process that requires a well-coordinated interaction between the implanting conceptus and the maternal uterus. In pigs , the conceptus undergoes dramatic morphological and functional changes at the time of implantation and introduces various factors , including estrogens and cytokines , interleukin-1β2 ( IL1B2) , interferon-γ ( IFNG) , and IFN-δ ( IFND) , into the uterine lumen. In response to ovarian steroid hormones and conceptus-derived factors , the uterine endometrium becomes receptive to the implanting conceptus by changing its expression of cell adhesion molecules , secretory activity , and immune response. Conceptus-derived estrogens act as a signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy by changing the direction of prostaglandin ( PG)
