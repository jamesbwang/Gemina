  Vascular access site-related complications are frequent in the context of transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR). The implantation of a covered stent graft is an effective treatment option for bleeding control. However , the external iliac and common femoral arteries are exposed to flexion of the hip<symptom> joint. Therefore , stent compression and stent/strut fractures may occur , facilitating stent occlusion. In all 389 patients who received transfemoral TAVR from 2013-2015 at the Düsseldorf Heart Centre , we monitored the management of vascular access site-related complications. Our analyses focused on immediate technical success and bleeding control , primary patency , and the occurrence of stent/strut fractures after six to 12 months of follow-up. Vascular access site-related complications occurred in 13 % ( n = 51) , whereof in 10 patients , the bleeding was successfully managed by prolonged compression. In 40 out of 51 patients , a covered stent graft was implanted in the common femoral artery , leading to 100 % immediate bleeding control. After a mean follow-up of 334 ± 188 days , 28 stents out of 29 patients with completed follow-up ( excluding e. g. death) were without flow-limiting stenosis ( primary patency 97 %) or relevant stent compression ( diameter pre/post 8.6/ 8.1 mm , p = 0.048 , late lumen loss 1.1 ± 0.2 mm , mean flow velocity 92 ± 34 cm/s). In four asymptomatic patients , stent/strut fractures were detected ( 14 %) without flow-limiting stenosis. The implantation of a covered stent graft is highly effective and safe to control vascular access site-related complications after TAVR. Stent/strut fractures in the flexible segment of the common femoral artery may occur , as consequently verified by X-ray visualization , but show no impairment on flow or clinical parameters after six to 12 months.
