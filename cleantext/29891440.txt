  To describe the 3-year progression-free survival ( PFS) , overall survival ( OS) and disease-specific mortality in the prospective prostate cancer GESCAP cohort , as well as the progression to castration resistance in patients on hormone therapy. Prospective , observational , epidemiological , multicentre study. Of the 4087 patients recruited , 3843 were evaluable. The variables analysed were the risk group ( localized , locally advanced , lymph involvement , metastatic) , age , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) levels , Gleason score and initial treatment. Kaplan Meier survival analysis , the log-rank test and the Cox model were used to evaluate the survival data. Three-year PFS was 81.4 % and OS was 92.4 %. During the 3 years of follow-up , 303 patients died ( 7.9 %) , 110 of them ( 36.3 %) due to disease-related causes. The probability of castration resistance for all patients on hormone therapy ( n = 715) was 14.2 %: 5 % , 9.9 % , 26.1 % and 44.4 % in localized , locally advanced , lymph involvement and metastatic cancer , respectively ( log-rank P < .0001). Patients with metastases had poorer outcomes with respect to PFS , OS , disease-specific mortality and castration resistance. In the multivariate analysis , the Gleason score , PSA and presence of metastases were associated with shorter OS and PFS. Our study showed stratification of risk , with a more unfavourable prognosis for patients with metastases. Patients with locally advanced disease differed with respect to those with localized disease due to their higher risk as regards disease-specific mortality. ( Controlled-trials.com ISRCTN19893319).
