  Smiles are distinct and easily recognizable facial expressions , yet they markedly differ in their meanings. According to a recent theoretical account , smiles can be classified based on three fundamental social functions which they serve: expressing positive affect and rewarding self and others ( reward smile) , creating and maintaining social bonds ( affiliative smile) , and negotiating social status ( dominance smiles) ( Niedenthal et al. , 2010; Martin et al. , 2017). While there is evidence for distinct morphological features of these smiles , their categorization only starts to be investigated in human faces. Moreover , the factors influencing this process- such as facial mimicry or display mode- remain yet unknown. In the present study , we examine the recognition of reward , affiliative , and dominance smiles in static and dynamic portrayals , and explore how interfering with facial mimicry affects such classification.
