  HB is the most common primary liver tumor in children. Complete tumor excision , either by partial resection or by total hepatectomy and liver transplantation , in combination with chemotherapy provides the best chance for cure. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent liver transplantation for HB and herein present our 14-year single-institution experience. Twenty-five patients underwent liver transplantation for HB at a median age of 26 months ( IQR: 15-44). Graft survival was 96 % , 87 % , and 80 % at 1 , 3 , and 5 years , respectively. There were four patient deaths , three of them due to disease recurrence within the first year post-transplant. Ten-year overall survival was 84 %. Three recipients initially presented with pulmonary metastases and underwent resection of metastatic disease , of which two are alive at 3.9 years. Of three patients who underwent salvage transplants , two are alive at 1.5 years after transplant. Non-survivors were associated with lower median alpha fetoprotein value at presentation compared to survivors ( 21 707 vs 343 214; P = .04). In conclusion , the overall long-term outcome of primary liver transplantation for HB is excellent. Tumor recurrence was the highest contributor to mortality. Even patients with completely treated pulmonary metastases prior to transplant demonstrated a favorable survival.
