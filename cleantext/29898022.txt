  Osteoporosis is an insidious and increasingly prevalent disease that can cause fractures and affect patients ' quality of life. The current study comparatively evaluates patients with and without loss of bone mass in terms of salivary calcium , viscosity , and pH. A controlled cross-sectional study was conducted in two groups of 32 postmenopausal women subjected to a bone densitometry scan and later referred for dental management at the Federal University of Minas Gerais , Brazil. The patients were assigned to two groups: Group 1- patients with low bone mineral density ( BMD) and Group 2- patients without bone mineral changes. The following salivary parameters were evaluated: calcium concentration , flow rate , viscosity , pH , and average total protein. An oral examination was performed for assessment of DMFT variables and tongue coating. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics , adopting a p-value < 0.05. The patients ' mean age was 60 years ( Â± 7.35). Salivary flow , pH , and viscosity were similar among the groups. Average total protein was 14.8 mg/mL and 19.0 mg/mL in Groups 1 and 2 , respectively. Tongue coating and salivary calcium levels were significantly higher in Group 1 ( p < 0.001). Salivary calcium is an important screening tool and may eventually be used for the diagnosis of bone mineral changes.
