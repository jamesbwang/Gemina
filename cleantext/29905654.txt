  There is a scarcity of work examining the relationship between culture and pain-related caregiver behaviors. Moreover , no pediatric pain studies have examined the relationship between caregiver cultural values and pain-related caregiver behaviors , specifically , if this process is mediated by caregiver parenting styles and moderated by eco-social context. Based on cross-cultural developmental theories , this study hypothesized that eco-social context would moderate the relationship between cultural values , parenting styles , and pain-related caregiver behaviors; and that parenting styles mediate the effect of cultural values on pain-related caregiver behaviors. A cross-cultural survey design was employed using a convenience sample of 547 caregivers of 6-12-year-olds living in Canada ( n = 183) , Iceland ( n = 184) , and Thailand ( n = 180). Multigroup structural equation modeling showed that eco-social context did not affect which cultural model of parenting the caregiver adopted. Parenting styles mediated the relationship between cultural values and pain-related caregiver behavior. Vertical/horizontal individualism , collectivism , and authoritative and authoritarian-parenting styles positively predicted solicitousness. Vertical individualism and authoritarian-parenting style positively predicted discouraging behavior , whereas other predictors did not. The findings support the sociocommunication model of children 's pain by showing that cultural context does affect parents ' behaviors. They also corroborate with others ' claims of solicitousness universality in a pediatric pain context. However , solicitousness may have different cultural meanings among individuals , and may be used in conjunction with discouraging behavior. The findings from this study have implications for theory development about culture and pediatric pain , but do not provide specific clinical recommendations.
