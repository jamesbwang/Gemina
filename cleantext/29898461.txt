  The limited negative predictive value of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration ( EBUS-TBNA) has often been discussed. The aim of this study was to identify a highly sensitive molecular biomarker for lymph node staging by EBUS-TBNA. Five microRNAs ( miRNAs) ( miR-200a , miR-200b , miR-200c , miR-141 , and let-7e) were selected as biomarker candidates for the detection of nodal metastasis in a miRNA expression analysis. After having established a cutoff level of expression for each marker to differentiate malignant from benign lymph nodes among surgically dissected lymph nodes , the cutoff level was applied to snap-frozen EBUS-TBNA samples. Archived formalin-fixed paraffin- embedded ( FFPE) samples rebiopsied by EBUS-TBNA after induction chemoradiotherapy were also analyzed. The expression of all candidate miRNAs was significantly higher in metastatic lymph nodes than in benign ones ( p < 0.05) among the surgical samples. miR-200c showed the highest diagnostic yield , with a sensitivity of 95.4 % and a specificity of 100 %. When the cutoff value for miR-200c was applied to the snap-frozen EBUS-TBNA samples , the sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , and diagnostic accuracy were 97.4 , 81.8 , 95.0 , 90.0 , and 94.0 % , respectively. For restaging FFPE EBUS- TBNA samples , the sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , and diagnostic accuracy were 100 , 60.0 , 80.0 , 100 , and 84.6 % , respectively. Among the restaged samples , 4 malignant lymph nodes were false negative by EBUS-TBNA , but they were accurately identified by miR-200c. miR-200c can be used as a highly sensitive molecular staging biomarker that will enhance nodal staging of lung cancer.
