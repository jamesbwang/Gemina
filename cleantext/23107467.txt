  Ubiquitin-like containing PHD Ring Finger 1 ( UHRF1) is a multi-domain protein with a methyl-DNA binding SRA ( SET and RING-associated) domain , required for maintenance DNA methylation mediated by DNMT1. Primarily expressed in proliferating cells , UHRF1 is a cell-cycle regulated protein that is required for S phase entry. Furthermore , UHRF1 participates in transcriptional gene regulation by connecting DNA methylation to histone modifications. Upregulation of UHRF1 may serve as a biomarker for a variety of cancers; including breast , gastric , prostate , lung and colorectal carcinoma. To this end , overexpression of UHRF1 promotes cancer metastasis by triggering aberrant patterns of DNA methylation , and subsequently , silencing tumor suppressor genes. Various small molecule effectors of UHRF1 have been reported in the literature , although the mechanism of action may not be fully characterized. Small molecules that potentially bind to the SRA domain may affect the ability of UHRF1 to bind hemimethylated DNA; thereby reducing aberrant DNA methylation. Therefore , in a subset of cancers , small molecule UHRF1 inhibitors may restore normal gene expression and serve as useful anti-cancer therapeutics.
