  Hepatoblastoma ( HB) is the most common pediatric liver malignant tumor. Previously , we reported co-activation of β-catenin and Yes-associated protein-1 ( YAP1) in 80 % of HB. Hepatic co-expression of active β-catenin and YAP1 via sleeping beauty transposon/transposase and hydrodynamic tail vein injection led to HB development in mice. Here , we identify lipocalin 2 ( Lcn2) as a target of β-catenin and YAP1 in HB and show that serum Lcn2 values positively correlated with tumor burden. Lcn2 was strongly expressed in HB tumor cells in our mouse model. A tissue array of 62 HB cases showed highest LCN2 expression in embryonal and lowest in fetal , blastemal , and small cell undifferentiated forms of HB. Knockdown of LCN2 in HB cells had no effect on cell proliferation but reduced NF-κB reporter activity. Next , liver-specific Lcn2 knockout ( KO) mice were generated. No difference in tumor burden was observed between Lcn2 KO mice and wild-type littermate controls after sleeping beauty transposon/transposase and hydrodynamic tail vein injection delivery of active YAP1 and β-catenin , although Lcn2 KO mice with HB lacked any serum Lcn2 elevation , demonstrating that transformed hepatocytes are the source of serum Lcn2. More blastemal areas and inflammation<symptom> were observed within HB in Lcn2 KO compared with wild-type tumors. In conclusion , Lcn2 expressed in hepatocytes appears to be dispensable for the pathogenesis of HB. However , transformed hepatocytes secrete serum Lcn2 , making Lcn2 a valuable biomarker for HB.
