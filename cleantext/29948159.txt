  Thyroid hormones are key regulators of avian metabolism and may play a significant role in development at hatching. To better understand the role of thyroid hormones in avian development , we examined autonomic control of heart rate and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> while manipulating thyroid hormone levels in the late stage embryonic Pekin duck ( Anas platyrhynchos domestica). Thyroid hormone levels were manipulated on day 24 of a 28-day incubation period with the thyroperoxidase inhibitor methimazole ( MMI) , triiodothyronine ( T
