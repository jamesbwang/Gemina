  The animal experiment was preformed to investigate the roles of PPAR-γ/PI3K/Akt pathway in apoptosis triggered by cadmium ( Cd) and in the antagonistic effects of selenium ( Se) on Cd in the pancreas of chicken. The current study showed that Cd treatment obviously increased the accumulation of Cd and directly led to lower activities of amylase , trypsin and lipase in chicken pancreas. The expression of PPAR-γ , PI3K , and Akt was declined , whereas the level of Bax , Cyt C and caspase-3 were increased in Cd group. In the result of TUNEL assay and the histological examination , typical apoptosis characteristics in the pancreas of Cd group were confirmed. Cd group also showed high levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) activity and nitric oxide ( NO) content in pancreas. However , those Cd-induced changes were obviously alleviated in Cd + Se group. Our study revealed that Cd could impact the pancreas function and induce the activation of Bax and the overproduction of NO via PPAR-γ/PI3K/Akt pathway to promote apoptosis in chicken pancreas. However , Se could reduce Cd accumulation and antagonize Cd-triggered apoptosis in chicken pancreas.
