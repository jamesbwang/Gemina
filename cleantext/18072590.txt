  Knowledge of community structure within an ecosystem is essential when trying to understand the function and importance of the system and when making related management decisions. Within the larger ecosystem , microhabitats play an important role by providing inhabitants with a subset of available resources. On coral reefs , cryptobenthic fishes encompass many groups and make up an important proportion of the biodiversity. However , these fishes are relatively small , exhibit extreme visual or behavioral camouflage , and , therefore , are often overlooked. We examined the differences in fish community structure between three common reef microhabitats ( live hard coral , dead coral rubble , and sand) using ichthyocide stations in the central Red Sea. Using a combination of morphological and genetic ( cytochrome oxidase I ( COI) barcoding) techniques , we identified 326 individuals representing 73 species spread across 17 families , from fifteen 1 m
