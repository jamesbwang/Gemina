  We have studied the stable geometries , band structures and magnetic properties of transition-metal ( V , Cr , Mn , Fe , Co and Ni) atoms absorbed on MoS2/h-BN heterostructure systems by first-principles calculations. By comparing the adsorption energies , we find that the adsorbed transition metal ( TM) atoms prefer to stay on the top of Mo atoms. The results of the band structure without spin-orbit coupling ( SOC) interaction indicate that the Cr-absorbed systems behave in a similar manner to metals , and the Co-absorbed system exhibits a half-metallic state. We also deduce that the V- , Mn- , Fe-absorbed systems are semiconductors with 100 % spin polarization at the HOMO level. The Ni-absorbed system is a nonmagnetic semiconductor. In contrast , the Co-absorbed system exhibits metallic state , and the bandgap of V-absorbed system decreases slightly according to the SOC calculations. In addition , the magnetic moments of all the six TM atoms absorbed on the MoS2/h-BN heterostructure systems decrease when compared with those of their free-standing states.
