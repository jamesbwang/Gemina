  We assess the use of fluorescent dissolved organic matter at excitation-emission wavelengths of 280nm and 360nm , termed tryptophan-like fluorescence ( TLF) , as an indicator of faecally contaminated drinking water. A significant logistic regression model was developed using TLF as a predictor of thermotolerant coliforms ( TTCs) using data from groundwater- and surface water-derived drinking water sources in India , Malawi , South Africa and Zambia. A TLF threshold of 1.3 ppb dissolved tryptophan was selected to classify TTC contamination. Validation of the TLF threshold indicated a false-negative error rate of 15 % and a false-positive error rate of 18 %. The threshold was unsuccessful at classifying contaminated sources containing < 10 TTC cfu per 100mL , which we consider the current limit of detection. If only sources above this limit were classified , the false-negative error rate was very low at 4 %. TLF intensity was very strongly correlated with TTC concentration ( ρ
