  Little is known on the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT) treatment modifications on surgical outcome and progression-free survival ( PFS) in patients with ovarian carcinoma. We aimed to report the changes we made during NACT and to evaluate its impact on patient outcome. A retrospective cohort study of all women with advanced stage ovarian carcinoma treated with NACT followed by interval cytoreduction in one university-affiliated medical center ( January 2005 to June 2017). We excluded those who were treated with NACT without any surgical intervention. NACT modifications included delay in treatment , change in chemotherapy , and dose reduction. Demographics , tumor characteristics , surgical outcome , and PFS were compared between patients exposed to NACT treatment modifications and those who received standard treatment. Seventy-nine patients met inclusion criteria of whom , 59 patients received standard , nonmodified treatment and 20 patients modified NACT. There were no intergroup differences with respect to age at diagnosis ( 59.5 ± 11.6 vs. 64.70 ± 8.09 , P = 0.09) and stage of disease ( P = 0.13). Radiologic complete response rates ( 25.0 % vs. 32.2 % , P = 0.545) and optimal cytoreduction rates ( 75.0 % vs. 86.4 % , P = 0.23) were similar in both treatment groups. Mean PFS ( in months) was comparable between patients receiving standard treatment and those who required NACT modifications ( 18.5 vs. 12.2 , P = 0.125). NACT treatment modifications did not affect surgical outcome and PFS. We conclude that when clinically indicated , dose alteration and scheduling can be implemented without apparent detriment to outcome.
