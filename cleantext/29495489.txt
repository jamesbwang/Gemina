  Fiber-reinforced polymer ( FRP) bars have been widely applied in civil engineering. This paper presents the results of an experimental study to investigate the tensile fatigue<symptom> mechanical properties of glass fiber-reinforced polymer ( GFRP) bars after elevated temperatures exposure. For this purpose , a total of 105 GFRP bars were conducted for testing. The specimens were exposed to heating regimes of 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 , 300 and 350 & deg; C for a period of 0 , 1 or 2 h. The GFRP bars were tested with different times of cyclic load after elevated temperatures exposure. The results show that the tensile strength and elastic modulus of GFRP bars decrease with the increase of elevated temperature and holding time , and the tensile strength of GFRP bars decreases obviously by 19.5 % when the temperature reaches 250 & deg; C. Within the test temperature range , the tensile strength of GFRP bars decreases at most by 28.0 %. The cyclic load accelerates the degradation of GFRP bars after elevated temperature exposure. The coupling of elevated temperature and holding time enhance the degradation effect of cyclic load on GFRP bars. The tensile strength of GFRP bars after elevated temperatures exposure at 350 & deg; C under cyclic load is reduced by 50.5 % compared with that at room temperature and by 36.3 % compared with that after exposing at 350 & deg; C without cyclic load. In addition , the elastic modulus of GFRP bars after elevated temperatures exposure at 350 & deg; C under cyclic load is reduced by 17.6 % compared with that at room temperature and by 6.0 % compared with that after exposing at 350 & deg; C without cyclic load.
