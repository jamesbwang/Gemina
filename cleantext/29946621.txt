  In the synthesis of lead telluride nanocrystals ( PbTe NCs) , oxidized PbTe is commonly regarded as a waste material as this will reduce the performance of pure PbTe NCs. The waste is normally thrown away , leading to potential environment risks and is less economical in terms of atom usage. Conventional anti-oxidation methods such as inert gas flow or sealed systems can not deal with leaking or accidental contamination. To solve this problem , by simulating accidental oxidation , we utilized a cheap and easily-performed strategy to reduce the oxidation to a very low level. Further analysis indicates that this anti-oxidation effect should be due to interactions between the double bonds from the coating ligands and the extended Ï€ bonds from the benzene rings. This strategy increases the synthesis efficiency of the reactants and reduces the environmental pollution risk.
