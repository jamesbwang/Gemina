  The involvement of the hemostatic system in immune-mediated inflammation<symptom> is widely reported. Many coagulation factors play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases , such as systemic vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Hemostatic disorders are also involved in asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria ( CSU). Factor XIIa ( FXIIa) was one of the first coagulation factors implicated in inducing both humoral and cellular responses and is therefore considered a prime new therapeutic target in immune-mediated inflammation<symptom>. The involvement of coagulation factors , such as tissue factor and fibrinogen , in the pathogenesis of asthma has been reported. The finding of platelet activation in asthma also indicates a link between bronchial inflammation<symptom> and hemostasis. The pathogenesis of mast cell degranulation and CSU was also shown to be associated with the activation of hemostatic factors such as fibrinogen and FXIIa. Increased plasma levels of D-dimer have been widely reported as a biological marker for the duration and severity of CSU. In addition , endothelial-induced cell activation by the kallikrein-high molecular weight complex and the release of heat shock<symptom> protein 90 was shown to be involved in mast cell degranulation disorders. In this narrative review , the authors aim to summarize the role of hemostasis in inflammation<symptom> , asthma , and CSU by focusing on the increasing information linking hemostatic factors and immune-mediated disorders.
