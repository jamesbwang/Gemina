  Carbapenem resistance in Gram-negative bacteria constitutes a major clinical problem. We propose to characterize molecular features among carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates collected from Southeastern Tunisian Island Hospital. Eighteen carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates ( 13 Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , 1 Proteus<pathogen> mirabilis<pathogen> , 1 Enterobacter<pathogen> cloacae<pathogen> , 3 Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> were recovered during April 2015-August 2016. Molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance was performed by PCR and sequencing. Molecular typing of carbapenemase-producing K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> was performed by PFGE after XbaI digestion and MLST. Conjugation experiments were carried out and type/number/size of plasmids were characterized by PCR-Based-Replicon-Typing and PFGE after S1 digestion. Carbapenemase genes were detected in K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( bla
