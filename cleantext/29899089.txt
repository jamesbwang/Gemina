  Recent studies show HIV-1 can utilize microtubules and their associated proteins to complete key post fusion steps during infection. This includes associating with both dynein and kinesin motors<symptom> , as well as proteins , which enhance infection by altering microtubule dynamics during infection. In this article , we will discuss these findings on how dynein and kinesin motors<symptom> , as well as other microtubule associated proteins , influence HIV-1 trafficking , viral core uncoating and nuclear import of the viral RNP.
