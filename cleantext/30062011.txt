  Bronchial asthma is an inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> of the airways. Beclomethasone dipropionate/Formoterol ( BDP/F) and Fluticasone furoate/Vilanterol ( FF/V) are two of the most effective LABA/ICS combinations for managing persistent bronchial asthma. Aim of the study was to compare the outcomes achieved in mild-to-moderate asthma patients assuming BDP/F 100/6 μg b.i.d. ( Group A) or FF/V 92/22 μg once-daily ( Group B) for 12-months. No head-to-head long-term comparison is available at present. Data were automatically and anonymously obtained from the institutional database: FEV The PS-matching process returned a cohort of 40 group A patients matched with 40 patients of group B , fully comparable for demographics , clinical characteristics , and comorbidities. The improvement in lung function was significant in both groups ( Both the ICS/LABA combinations proved effective , even if characterized by different patterns of effectiveness either in terms of lung function and of long-term clinical outcomes. Only the once-daily inhalation of combined FF/V 92/22 μg once-daily optimized systematically the exacerbation and hospitalization rates in mild-to-moderate asthma , together with all other outcomes over time. The effectiveness of FF/V 92/22 once-daily μg proved progressive and time-dependent over the twelve-month period of the study , and associated to a higher adherence to treatment.
