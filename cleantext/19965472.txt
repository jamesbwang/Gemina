  The selective hydrogenation of isophorone ( 3,5,5-trimethyl-2- cyclohexen-1-one) to produce 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone ( TMCH) , an important organic solvent and pharmaceutical intermediate , is of significance in industry. However , the over-hydrogenation to produce the by-product 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanol causes issues. Up to now , it is still a challenge to hydrogenate isophorone to TMCH with high selectivity. In this work , we found that Lewis acids could inhibit the hydrogenation of C =O bond on isophorone , thus greatly improving the selectivity towards TMCH. In addition , added solvents like supercritical CO
