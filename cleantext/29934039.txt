  Napoleon died of a cancer of the stomach. Another assumption can be proposed , that of an uron√©phrologique pathology. It is about a historical study basing on the report of autopsy of Antommarchi and the assumptions formulated according to the urinary and nephrologic symptoms presented during his life.

The urethra of Napoleon led France of the empire to the republic.
