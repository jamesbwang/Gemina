  Caregivers are critical to recipient recovery after hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT); however , little is known about their long-term health and quality of life ( QoL). In this study we surveyed 4446 caregiver-recipient pairs in the post-HCT period to describe their QoL and its determinants. In total , 849 caregiver-recipient pairs at a median of 6 years after autologous or allogeneic HCT responded. Among 849 responding caregivers at a median of 6 years post-HCT , 67 % of caregivers were women and 68 % indicated they were still providing care to the recipient. Mean and median QoL measures of caregivers were at or above general population norms; however , approximately 20 % of caregivers reported poor QoL relative to general population norms. Multivariate analysis revealed that caregiver characteristics , including age , gender , and educational attainment , were important determinants of caregiver QoL. Additional determinants of caregiver QoL included recipient QoL , relapse after autologous HCT , and ongoing use of immunosuppression after allogeneic HCT. Additionally , the prevalence of depression<symptom> and sleep disorders appear to be higher in caregivers than in the general population. We have identified a population of caregivers who may benefit from interventions aimed at improving QoL and health outcomes. HCT clinical practice should also consider caregiver well-being.
