  Bioactive peptides derived from the receptor-binding region of human apolipoprotein E have previously been reported. All these peptides , encompassing fragments of this region or designed on the basis of short repeated cationic sequences identified in the same region , show toxic activities against a broad spectrum of bacteria and interesting immunomodulatory effects. However , the ability of these molecules to exert antibiofilm properties has not been described so far. In the present work , we report the characterization of a novel peptide , corresponding to residues 133 to 167 of human apolipoprotein E , here named ApoE ( 133-167). This peptide , besides presenting interesting properties comparable with those reported for other ApoE-derived peptides , such as a direct killing activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria or the ability to downregulate lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine release , is also endowed with significant antibiofilm properties. Indeed , the peptide is able to strongly affect the formation of the extracellular matrix and also the viability of encapsulated bacteria. Noteworthy , ApoE ( 133-167) is not toxic toward human and murine cell lines and is able to assume ordered conformations in the presence of membrane mimicking agents. Taken together , collected evidences about biological and structural properties of ApoE ( 133-167) open new perspectives in the design of therapeutic agents based on human-derived bioactive peptides.
