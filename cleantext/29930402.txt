  To predict the need of intensive care unit admission with organ support during the transplantation hospital stay in 101 consecutives allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( allo-HCT) recipients the added predictive utility of three times per week Copeptin , MR-proADM , MR-proANP , NT-proBNP , IL-6 , Procalcitonin , D-dimer and three times per week bed-sided pulmonary function test was determined in comparison with an index model. The index model was calculated by multivariate regression analysis out of the patients ' routine laboratory parameters. To calculate the added predictive utility of the investigated markers the Δ-AUC and the continuous net reclassification improvement ( cNRI + 2 to- 2) , splitted for events and non-events were calculated for each marker in comparison with the index model. According to the Δ-AUC , none of the parameters improved risk prediction. In contrast , the cNRI was significantly improved for events and non-events by Copeptin ( event 0.75 , p value 0.0013; non-event 0.4 , p value 0.000079) and for events by NT-proBNP ( 0.6 , p value 0.018). D-dimer and PCT significantly predicted the non-event. Of the spirometry parameters , the FEF
