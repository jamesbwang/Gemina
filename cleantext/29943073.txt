  Ruptured abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> ( rAAA) is a life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate. Seasonal variations in the incidence of rAAA and the influence of atmospheric pressure have been studied throughout decades; however , the conclusions are contradictory. Therefore , we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis and systematic review of literature on seasonal variations in rAAA incidence and the influence of atmospheric pressure. Studies investigating seasonal variations in rAAA incidence and influence of atmospheric pressure were retrieved. For dichotomous data , we generated risk ratios ( RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) for rAAA incidence compared among seasons. The studies were subdivided according to latitude , elevation , and climatic types , for subgroup comparisons. Studies reporting monthly incidence and seasonal mortality were further investigated. For continuous data , standardized mean differences ( SMDs) and 95 % CIs were generated for atmospheric pressure comparisons. Twenty-four eligible studies were included , comprising a total of 38,506 patients with rAAA. Pooled rAAA incidence was 25 % in spring , 23 % in summer , 26 % in autumn , and 26 % in winter. Pooled analysis demonstrated a statistically significant higher rAAA incidence in winter than in summer ( RR 1.10 , P = 0.04) and in autumn than in summer ( RR 1.11 , P < 0.00001). However , there was no statistically significant difference among other seasons. In the study of the influence of atmospheric pressure , no statistically significant difference was observed. In conclusion , our study revealed a higher incidence of rAAA in autumn and winter than in summer; however , atmospheric pressure was found to exert no influence.
