  Delirium<symptom> develops in most critically ill Intensive Care Unit ( ICU) patients and is associated with longer hospital stay , increased rate of mortality and increased cost of healthcare. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of delirium<symptom> in non-ventilated ICU patients and demonstrate its clinical association with the hospital/ ICU length of stay and in-patient mortality. A total of 200 ICU patients ( aged 18 years or over) who were admitted to the ICU with specific primary diagnoses were selected for the study and followed up until either hospital discharge or death. Delirium<symptom> status of each patient was assessed every morning by trained study personnel using the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit ( CAM-ICU). Data collection included baseline demographics , diagnosis ( at the time of admission) and severity of illness using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II ( APACHE II) score. Upon evaluation of the effects associated with age , gender , mortality and other variables , it was found that age had a direct effect on the incidence of delirium<symptom> , with the probability of delirium<symptom> increasing with the increase in the age of patients. It was also shown that mortality , either in the ICU or during the hospital stay , was associated significantly with the occurrence of delirium<symptom>. This study shows that duration of delirium<symptom> in ICU is an independent predictor of long-term hospital stay and is significantly associated with mortality. These findings are crucial for health care professionals and future research trials dealing with critically ill ICU patients.
