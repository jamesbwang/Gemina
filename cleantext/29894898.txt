  Long-range projection neurons of the neocortex form the major tracts of the mammalian brain and are crucial for sensory-motor , associative and executive functions. Development of such circuits involves neuronal proliferation , specification and migration , as well as axonal elongation , navigation and targeting , where growing axons encounter multiple guidance cues and integrate these signals to execute guidance decisions. The complexity of axon guidance mechanisms in the formation of long-range neuronal projections has suggested that they might be under control of transcription factors , which are DNA-binding proteins that regulate the expression of downstream genes. Here we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the control of axon guidance by transcriptional regulation , as well as future directions for the elucidation of the mechanisms and pathological relevance of this process.
