  Identify biomarkers in peripheral blood that relate to chronic post-concussive and behavioural symptoms following traumatic brain injuries ( TBIs) to ultimately improve clinical management. We compared military personnel with mild TBIs ( mTBIs) ( n = 42) to those without TBIs ( n = 22) in concentrations of tau , amyloid-beta ( Aβ42) and cytokines ( tumour necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNFα , interleukin ( IL) -6 and -10) in neuronal-derived exosomes from the peripheral blood. We utilized nanosight technology coupled with ultra-sensitivity immunoassay methods. We also examined the impact of post-concussive and behavioural symptoms including depression<symptom> and post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) on these neuronal-derived markers. We report that concentrations of exosomal tau ( F These findings suggest that chronic post-concussive symptoms following an mTBI relate to altered exosomal activity , and that greater tau pathology may underlie chronic post-concussive symptoms that develop following mTBIs. It also suggests that central inflammatory activity contributes to PTSD symptoms following an mTBI , providing necessary insights into the role of inflammation<symptom> in chronic PTSD symptoms.
