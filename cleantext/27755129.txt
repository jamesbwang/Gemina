  Diet during pregnancy greatly impacts health outcomes. This study aims to measure changes in dietary intakes throughout trimesters and to assess pregnant women & rsquo; s dietary intakes in comparison with current Canadian nutritional recommendations. Seventy-nine pregnant women were recruited and completed , within each trimester , three Web-based 24-h dietary recalls and one Web questionnaire on supplement use. Dietary intakes from food , with and without supplements , were compared to nutritional recommendations throughout pregnancy. Energy and macronutrient intakes remained stable throughout pregnancy. A majority of women exceeded their energy and protein requirements in the first trimester , and fat intakes as a percentage of energy intakes were above recommendations for more than half of the women in all trimesters. Supplement use increased dietary intakes of most vitamins and minerals , but 20 % of women still had inadequate total vitamin D intakes and most women had excessive folic acid intakes. This study showed that pregnant women did not increase their energy intakes throughout pregnancy as recommended. Furthermore , although prenatal supplementation reduces the risk of inadequate intake for most micronutrients , there is still a risk of excessive folic acid and insufficient vitamin D intake , which needs further investigation.
