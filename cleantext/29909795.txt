  To examine associations between household-level characteristics and underweight in a post-conflict population. Nutritional status of residents in the Gulu Health and Demographic Surveillance Site was obtained during a community-based cross-sectional study , ~ 6 years after the civil war. Household-level factors included headship , polygamy , household size , child-to-adult ratio , child crowding , living with a stunted or overweight person , deprived area , distance to health centre and socio-economic status. Multilevel logistic regression models examined associations of household and community factors with underweight , calculating OR , corresponding 95 % CI and intraclass correlation coefficients. Effect modification by gender and age was examined by interaction terms and stratified analyses. Rural post-conflict area in northern Uganda. In total , 2799 households and 11 312 individuals were included , representing all age groups. Living in a female-headed v. male-headed household was associated ( OR; 95 % CI) with higher odds for underweight among adult men ( 2 · 18; 1 · 11 , 4 · 27) and girls < 5 years ( 1 · 51; 0 · 97 , 2 · 34) , but lower odds among adolescent women aged 13-19 years ( 0 · 46; 0 · 22 , 0 · 97). Higher odds was seen for residents living in deprived areas ( 1 · 37; 0 · 97 , 1 · 94) , with increasing distance to health services ( P-trend < 0 · 05) and among adult men living alone v. living in an average-sized household of seven members ( 3 · 23; 1 · 22 , 8 · 59). Residents living in polygamous households had lower odds for underweight ( 0 · 79; 0 · 65 , 0 · 97). The gender- and age-specific associations between household-level factors and underweight are likely to reflect local social capital structures. Adapting to these is crucial before implementing health and nutrition interventions.
