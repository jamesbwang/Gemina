  The purpose of this study was to histologically evaluate new bone formation and dimensional soft tissue changes of two different healing protocols ( 16 weeks and 32 weeks) using deproteinized bovine bone mineral ( DBBM) covered with collagen matrix ( CM) for alveolar ridge preservation in the anterior esthetic zone prior to dental implant placement. Compared to baseline , both treatments yielded statistically significant differences in several clinical parameters and in the microarchitecture of the native bone and in the newly formed bone in the augmented sites. However , the protocol at 32 weeks determined greater new vital bone formation and fewer dimensional tissue changes.
