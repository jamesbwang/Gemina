  The phase lock value ( PLV) is an effective method to analyze the phase synchronization of the brain , which can effectively separate the phase components of the electroencephalogram ( EEG) signal and reflect the influence of the signal intensity on the functional connectivity. However , the traditional locking algorithm only analyzes the phase component of the signal , and ca n't effectively analyze characteristics of EEG signal. In order to solve this problem , a new algorithm named amplitude locking value ( ALV) is proposed. Firstly , the improved algorithm obtained intrinsic mode function using the empirical mode decomposition , which was used as input for Hilbert transformation ( HT). Then the instantaneous amplitude was calculated and finally the ALV was calculated. On the basis of ALV , the instantaneous amplitude of EEG signal can be measured between electrodes. The data of 14 subjects under different cognitive tasks were collected and analyzed for the coherence of the brain regions during the arithmetic by the improved method. The results showed that there was a negative correlation between the coherence and cognitive activity , and the central and parietal areas were most sensitive. The quantitative analysis by the ALV method could reflect the real biological information. Correlation analysis based on the ALV provides a new method and idea for the research of synchronism , which offer a foundation for further exploring the brain mode of thinking.
