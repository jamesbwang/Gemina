  Standing genetic variation enables or restricts a population 's capacity to respond to changing conditions , including the extreme<symptom> disturbances<symptom> expected to increase in frequency and intensity with continuing anthropogenic climate change. However , we know little about how populations might respond to extreme events with rapid genetic shifts , or how population dynamics may influence and be influenced by population genomic change. We use a range-wide epizootic , sea star wasting disease , that onset in mid-2013 and caused mass mortality in
