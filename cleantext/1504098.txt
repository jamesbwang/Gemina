  Creating efficient cell lines is a priority for the biopharmaceutical industry , which produces biologicals for various uses. A recent approach to achieving this goal is the use of non-coding RNAs , microRNA ( miRNA) and small interfering RNA ( siRNA) , to identify key genes that can potentially improve production or growth.
