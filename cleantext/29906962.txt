  Two-dimensional crystals on curved manifolds exhibit nontrivial defect structures. Here we consider `` active crystals '' on a sphere , which are composed of self-propelled colloidal particles. Our work is based on a phase-field-crystal-type model that involves a density and a polarization field on the sphere. Depending on the strength of the self-propulsion , three different types of crystals are found: a static crystal , a self-spinning `` vortex-vortex '' crystal containing two vortical poles of the local velocity , and a self-translating `` source-sink '' crystal with a source pole where crystallization occurs and a sink pole where the active crystal melts. These different crystalline states as well as their defects are studied theoretically here and can in principle be confirmed in experiments.
