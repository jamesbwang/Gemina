  Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) were proposed to be important regulators influencing various differentiation processes. Yet , the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs governing osteogenic differentiation of Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells ( PDLSCs) remain unclear. Here , PDLSCs were isolated from normal periodontal ligament of human ( PDL) whereas P-PDLSCs were isolated from periodontitis<disease> affected PDL. Quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR) was performed to examine the relative expression level of lncRNA-ANCR and of Osterix ( OSX) , Alkaline Phosphatase ( ALP) as well as Runt-related transcription factor 2 ( RUNX2) in PDLSCs. Gain- and loss-of- function experiments was performed to study the role of lncRNA-ANCR. Alizarin Red staining was used to evaluate the function of lncRNA-ANCR and miRNA-758 on osteogenic differentiation. In addition , via dual luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation the microRNA sponge potential of lncRNA-ANCR was assessed. A luciferase reporter assay identified the correlation between miR-758 and Notch2. Our results showed that the expression of ALP , RUNX2 and OSX were increased whereas lncRNA-ANCR was decreased during the process of differentiation in PDLSCs. Overexpression of lncRNA-ANCR decreased the expression of ALP , RUNX2 and OSX as confirmed by Alizarin red staining. Overexpression of lncRNA-ANCR resulted in reduction of the miR-758 expression level. Furthermore , RNA immunoprecipitation proved that lncRNA-ANCR targets miR-758 directly. The results of dual luciferase reporter assay also demonstrated that miR-758 regulated Notch2 expression by targeting 3 '- UTR of Notch2. In conclusion , the novel pathway lncRNA-ANCR/miR -758/ Notch2 plays an important role in the process of regulating osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs.
