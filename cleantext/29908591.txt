  Emerging infectious<disease> diseases<disease> arise as a result of novel interactions between populations of hosts and pathogens , and can threaten the health and wellbeing of the entire spectrum of biodiversity. Bees and their viruses are a case in point. However , detailed knowledge of the ecological factors and evolutionary forces that drive disease emergence in bees and other host-pathogen communities is surprisingly lacking. In this review , we build on the fundamental insight that viruses evolve and adapt over timescales that overlap with host ecology. At the same time , we integrate the role of host community ecology , including community structure and composition , biodiversity loss , and human-driven disturbance , all of which represent significant factors in bee virus ecology. Both of these evolutionary and ecological perspectives represent major advances but , in most cases , it remains unclear how evolutionary forces actually operate across different biological scales ( e.g. , from cell to ecosystem). We present a molecule-to-ecology framework to help address these issues , emphasizing the role of molecular mechanisms as key bottom-up drivers of change at higher ecological scales. We consider the bee-virus system to be an ideal one in which to apply this framework. Unlike many other animal models , bees constitute a well characterized and accessible multispecies assemblage , whose populations and interspecific interactions can be experimentally manipulated and monitored in high resolution across space and time to provide robust tests of prevailing theory.
