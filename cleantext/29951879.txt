  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide , and new treatment strategies for CRC are required because of the existing chemotherapy resistance. Iron chelators , which have been used widely for the treatment of iron-overload disease , were reported to exert anti-proliferative effects in cancer. However , the role of iron chelation in CRC was largely unknown. In this study , we found that the iron chelator DFO inhibited CRC cell growth significantly. In addition , the gene expression profile was greatly changed by DFO treatment , and many cell growth-related genes were dysregulated. Further study showed that DFO induced a significant increase in global histone methylation in CRC cells. However , the levels of histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases did not change in response to DFO treatment , implying that the enzymatic activity of these enzymes might be regulated by iron chelation. In conclusion , this study reveals a novel role for DFO in CRC cell growth , and is the first to demonstrate that global histone methylation is modulated by iron chelation in CRC cells.
