  Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band ( LAGB) placement remains a common bariatric procedure. While LAGB procedure is performed within private clinics in most Canadian provinces , public health care is often utilized for LAGB-related reoperations. We identified 642 gastric band removal procedures performed in Ontario from 2011 to 2014 using population-level administrative data. The number of procedures performed increased annually from 101 in 2011 to 220 in 2014. Notably , 54.7 % of the patients required laparotomy , and 17.6 % of patients underwent a subsequent bariatric surgery. Our findings demonstrated that LAGB placement in private clinics resulted in a large number of band removal procedures performed within the public system. This represents a significant public health concern that may result in significant health care utilization and patient morbidity.
