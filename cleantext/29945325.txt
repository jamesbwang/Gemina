  ClC-3 is involved in the proliferation and migration of several cancer cells. However , ClC-3 expression and its role of cell-cycle control in multiple myeloma ( MM) has not yet been investigated. MM cells were treated with different concentrations of IGF ( 30 , 100 , 300 ng/mL) , and their proliferation was examined by CCK-8. The effects of ClC-3 on cell cycle progression was detected by flow cytometry. Western blot was used to analyze the relative levels of ClC3 , CD138 , P21 , P27 , CDK , p-Erk1/ 2 , and t-Erk1/ 2 protein expression. Transfection of RPMI8226 with gpClC-3 cDNA and siRNA alters the expression of ClC-3. We compared the expression of ClC-3 in primary myeloma cells and in MM cell lines ( U266 and RPMI8266) with that in normal plasma cells ( PCs) from normal subjects and found that myeloma cells from patients and MM cell lines had significantly higher expression of ClC-3. Additionally , silencing of ClC-3 with the small interfering RNA ( siRNA) that targets human ClC-3 decreased proliferation of RPMI8226 after IGF-1 treatment and slowed cell cycle progression from G0/G1 to S phase , which was associated with diminished phosphorylation of ERK1/2 , down-expression of cyclin E , cyclin D1 and up-regulation of p27 and p21. By contrast , overexpression of ClC-3 potentiated cell proliferation induced by IGF-1 , raised the percentage of S phase cells , enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 , downregulated p27 and p21 and upregulated cyclin E and cyclin D1. ClC-3 accelerated G0/G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle by modulating ERK1/2 kinase activity and expression of G1/S transition related proteins , making ClC-3 an attractive therapeutic target in MM.
