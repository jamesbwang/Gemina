  Antarctic humpback whales are recovering from near extirpation from commercial whaling. To understand the dynamics of this recovery and establish a baseline to monitor impacts of a rapidly changing environment , we investigated sex ratios and pregnancy rates of females within the Western Antarctic Peninsula ( WAP) feeding population. DNA profiling of 577 tissue samples ( 2010-2016) identified 239 males and 268 females. Blubber progesterone levels indicated 63.5 % of the females biopsied were pregnant. This proportion varied significantly across years , from 36 % in 2010 to 86 % in 2014. A comparison of samples collected in summer versus fall showed significant increases in the proportion of females present ( 50 % to 59 %) and pregnant ( 59 % to 72 %) , consistent with demographic variation in migratory timing. We also found evidence of annual reproduction among females; 54.5 % of females accompanied by a calf were pregnant. These high pregnancy rates are consistent with a population recovering from past exploitation , but appear inconsistent with recent estimates of WAP humpback population growth. Thus , our results will help to better understand population growth potential and set a current baseline from which to determine the impact of climate change and variability on fecundity and reproductive rates.
