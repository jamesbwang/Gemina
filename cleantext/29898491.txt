  Chronic pancreatitis<disease> is a fibroinflammatory syndrome<disease> of the exocrine pancreas , which is characterized by an increasing incidence , high morbidity and lethality. Common etiologies besides alcohol and nicotine consumption include genetic causes and risk factors. The life time risk for the development of pancreatic cancer is elevated 13- to 45-fold depending on the underlying etiology. In patients with chronic pancreatitis<disease> clinical , laboratory and imaging surveillance for early detection of complications , including pancreatic cancer , is recommended , although the available methods lack the desired sensitivity and specificity. In this article we review the epidemiology , etiologies and risk factors for chronic pancreatitis<disease> and pancreatic cancer and discuss current recommendations for screening and management of patients at risk for tumor development.
