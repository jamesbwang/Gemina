  Research on assessing or managing medication adherence applies approaches from observational , interventional , and implementation science that spans many disciplines and demands coherent conceptualization , valid methods , appropriate analyses , and complete and accurate reporting. To ensure such reporting , the European Society for Patient Adherence , COMpliance , and Persistence ( ESPACOMP) Medication Adherence Reporting Guideline ( EMERGE) recommends standard reporting approaches based on an accepted taxonomy. This guideline is derived from a literature review , a reactive Delphi study with 26 medication adherence experts from many countries and disciplines , and feedback from ESPACOMP members. It is designed to supplement existing guidelines for health research reporting and is structured around 4 minimum reporting criteria and 17 items reflecting best reporting practice. By enhancing and harmonizing research reporting , EMERGE aims to advance research and , ultimately , patient outcomes.
