  The suggested link between Î²-N-methylamino-L-alanine ( BMAA) and the onset of neurodegenerative diseases and the detection of this cyanotoxin in aquatic organisms has prompted research into the potential human exposure risk associated with sourcing food items from eutrophied water bodies worldwide. The Hartbeespoort Dam reservoir in the North West province of South Africa has persistent cyanobacterial blooms and is used extensively by anglers , many of whom consume their catch. The commercial sale of fish species harvested from this reservoir as part of a recent biomanipulative remediation strategy may pose an additional hazard. BMAA and Microcystins ( MC) were detected in fish sourced from this reservoir. BMAA levels of up to 1630 ng g
