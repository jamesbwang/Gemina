  The success of the pathogenic bacteria is partly attributable to their ability to thwart host innate immune responses , which includes resisting the antimicrobial functions of macrophages. And reactive oxygen species ( ROS) is one of the most effective antimicrobial components of macrophages to kill invading bacteria. Our previous studies found that Aeromonas<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> can survive in fish macrophages , which suggested that this bacterium<pathogen> might take fish macrophages as their shelters to resist drug killings and other immune damage. But how A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> survive in host macrophages remains unknown. Since KatG has been reported to have not only catalase activity but also peroxidase and peroxynitritase activity , the amino acid sequence and protein structure of KatG was analyzed in this study , the function of KatG in A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> survival in and escape from host macrophages was also carried out. The bioinformatics analysis displayed that KatG of A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> B11 showed > 93 % homologous to that of KatG in other Aeromonas. KatG of A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> was stable silenced by shRNA and RT-qPCR confirmed the expression of KatG in KatG-RNAi was significantly reduced. The survival rate of intracellular KatG-RNAi decreased by 80 % compared to that of the wild type strain B11 , while the intracellular ROS level of the macrophages that phagocytosed KatG-RNAi increased 65.9 % when compared to that of the macrophages phagocytosed wild-type strain. The immune escape rate of A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> decreased by 85 % when the expression of KatG was inhibited. These results indicated that ( 1) The amino acid sequence and protein structure of KatG of A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> is conserved; ( 2) KatG helped A.<pathogen> hydrophila<pathogen> to survive in fish macrophages by eliminating the harm of intracellular H
