  Metal coordination complexes can display interesting biological activity , as illustrated by the bleomycins ( BLMs) , a family of natural antibiotics that when coordinated to a redox-active metal ion , show antitumor activity. Yet , which metal ion is required for the activity in cells is still subject to debate. In this study , we described how different metal ions affect the intracellular behavior and activity of the synthetic BLM-mimic N , N-bis ( 2-pyridylmethyl)- N-bis ( 2-pyridyl) methylamine ( N4Py). Our study shows that a mixture of iron ( II) , copper ( II) , and zinc ( II) complexes can be generated when N4Py is added to cell cultures but that the metal ion can also be exchanged by other metal ions present in cells. Moreover , the combination of chemical data , together with the performed biological experiments , shows that the active complex causing oxidative damage to cells is the Fe
