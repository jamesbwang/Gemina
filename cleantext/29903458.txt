  Recently , a bundled payment model was implemented in the United States to improve quality and reduce costs. While hospitals may be rewarded for lowering costs , they may be financially exposed by high cost complications , the so-called bundle busters. We aimed at determining the incidence , etiology , and costs of postacute complications after total joint arthroplasty ( TJA). A retrospective study was conducted using a prospectively collected database of patients who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty ( THA) or total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) from January 2015 to April 2016. Nurse navigators performed postoperative surveillance to identify patients with complications and unplanned clinical events in the 90-day postoperative period. This was combined with episode-of-care costs provided by third-party payers to derive the mean and per capita costs of postacute complications and clinical events. Among 3018 THA and 5389 TKA patients , 3.35 % of THA and 2.62 % of TKA patients sought emergency department or urgent care services , 2.62 % of THA and 3.69 % of TKA patients required hospital readmission , and 3.99 % of TKA patients required manipulation. Joint-related complications were more common following THA , whereas medical complications were more frequent after TKA. The most costly complications after THA were periprosthetic fracture , dislocation , and myocardial infarction , compared to deep infection , myocardial infarction , and pulmonary embolism after TKA. Joint-related complications were among the most costly events after TJA , and given their higher incidence after THA , had a larger impact on per capita costs. Medical complications were more common after TKA and more costly. Despite these events , postacute complications made up less than 5 % of the total 90-day costs of TJA.
