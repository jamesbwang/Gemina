  Over the last few decades<pathogen> , public life<pathogen> has taken center<pathogen> stage<pathogen> in urban studies<pathogen> , but that is about to change. At times<pathogen> , indoor activities<pathogen> have been shown to matter more than what is publicly visible ( they have been found to be more predictive of future crimes<pathogen> , for example<pathogen>). Until recently , however , data<pathogen> has not been available to study indoor activities<pathogen> at city<pathogen> scale<pathogen>. To that end<pathogen> , we propose a new methodology<pathogen> that relies on tagging information<pathogen> of geo-referenced pictures<pathogen> and unfolds in three main steps<pathogen>. First , we collected and classified a comprehensive set<pathogen> of activity-related words<pathogen> , creating the first dictionary<pathogen> of urban activities<pathogen>. Second , for both London and New<pathogen> York City , we collected geo-referenced Flickr<pathogen> tags<pathogen> and matched them with the words<pathogen> in the dictionary<pathogen>. This step<pathogen> produced both a systematic classification<pathogen> ( our activity-related words<pathogen> were best classified in eleven<pathogen> categories<pathogen>) and two city-wide indoor activity<pathogen> maps<pathogen> which , when compared to open data<pathogen> of public amenities<pathogen> and sensory maps<pathogen> of smell<pathogen> and sound<pathogen> matched theoretical expectations<pathogen>. Third<pathogen> , we studied , for the first time<pathogen> , activities<pathogen> happening indoor in relation<pathogen> to neighborhood<pathogen> socio-economic conditions<pathogen>. We found the very same result<pathogen> for both London and New<pathogen> York City. In deprived areas<pathogen> , people<pathogen> focused on any of the activity<pathogen> types<pathogen> ( leading to specialization<pathogen>) , and it did not matter on which one<pathogen> they did so. By contrast<pathogen> , in well-to-do areas<pathogen> , people<pathogen> engaged not in one type<pathogen> of activity<pathogen> but in a variety<pathogen> of them ( leading to
