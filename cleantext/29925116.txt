  Using qualitative-hermeneutical methods with a focus on biographical ( risk-) constellations for conditions of success or failure of return to work- and therefore on the efficiency and sustainability of employment participation benefits- the study accompanies participants during a time span of 2 years after their vocational retraining on their way back into the first labor market. The study applies a mixed method design which combines 30 episodical-narrative interviews of participating rehabilitants alongside with a questionnaire survey of a total of 214 participants and 19 interviews of scientists and vocational retraining experts. Overall approximately 80 % of the participants of our sample successfully return to work within a period of 18 months. Significant barriers can be illustrated by characteristic risk constellations , which correspond to the following dimensions: occupational choice , coping with illness , the need for protective area beyond the rehabilitation scheme , lack of ( typical) life course orientation , lack of acceptance of a transitional phase with lower salary , regional occupation-specific labor market as well as social inclusion and support. Qualitative-hermeneutical methods generate- apart from diagnostic attributions and theoretical hypotheses- new factors effective for return to work with importance for rehabilitants; these factors refer to their embeddedness in processes , interrelations and interactions between biography , context factors , and administrative routines. The results identify specific needs for post-rehabilitation services supporting persons with risk constellations.
