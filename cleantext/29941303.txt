  Although the pronator teres muscle , a major dynamic stabilizer of elbow valgus stress during throwing , frequently presents stiffness , its relationship with elbow injuries in youth baseball players is unknown. This study investigated the relationship between the elasticity of the pronator teres muscle and elbow injuries in youth baseball players. The strain ratio ( SR) of 15 individuals with osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum ( OCD group) , 67 individuals with medial epicondylar fragmentation ( medial injury group) , and 115 healthy individuals ( control group) was measured as the index of the elasticity of the pronator teres muscle using ultrasound strain elastography. In addition , the forearm and glenohumeral joint rotation range of motion was measured. The SR of the throwing arm was significantly higher in the OCD and medial injury groups than in the control group ( both P < .001). In the OCD group , the SR was significantly higher in the throwing arm than in the nonthrowing arm ( P < .001) , whereas in the medial injury group , there was no significant difference between both arms. The glenohumeral joint external rotation range of motion of the throwing arm was moderately negatively correlated with the SR ( r = -0.478 , P < .001). Stiffness of the pronator teres muscle was exhibited only in the throwing arm of individuals with OCD and in both arms in individuals with medial elbow injury. These findings may contribute to an accurate evaluation and prevention of elbow injuries in youth baseball players.
