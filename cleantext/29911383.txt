  Versatile self-assembly systems to nanostructured materials in both solid and solution were developed with common amphiphilic random copolymers bearing hydrophilic poly ( ethylene glycol) ( PEG) and hydrophobic crystalline octadecyl pendants. The copolymers efficiently induced precision self-assembly of the pendants to provide not only core-crystalline , thermoresponsive micelles and vesicles in water and reverse micelles in hexane but also sub-10 nm lamellar or spherical microphase separation structure in solid. Typically , the solid random copolymers with 50-80 mol % octadecyl units formed lamellar structure of a hydrophilic PEG layer and a hydrophobic , crystalline octadecyl layer. Importantly , the domain spacing is about 5 nm , much smaller than that generally obtained with conventional block copolymers. The domain structure is controlled by composition , independent of chain length. The copolymers further gave various thermoresponsive , compartmentalized materials in aqueous and organic media , where the 3D structure can be also controlled by the composition and sample preparation protocols.
