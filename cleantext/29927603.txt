  Nanoparticles made of amphiphilic block copolymers comprising biodegradable core-forming blocks are very attractive for the preparation of drug-delivery systems with sustained release. Their therapeutic applications are , however , hindered by low values of the drug-loading content ( DLC). The compatibility between the drug and the core-forming block of the copolymer is considered the most important factor affecting the DLC value. However , the molecular picture of the hydrophobic drug-copolymer interaction is still not fully recognized. Herein , we examined this complex issue using a range of experimental techniques in combination with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We performed an analysis of the interaction between itraconazole , a model hydrophobic drug , and a poly ( ethylene glycol)- poly ( lactide- co-glycolide) ( PEG-PLGA) copolymer , a biodegradable copolymer commonly used for the preparation of drug-delivery systems. Our results clearly show that the limited capacity of the PEG-PLGA nanoparticles for the accumulation of hydrophobic drugs is due to the fact that the drug molecules are located only at the water-polymer interface , whereas the interior of the PLGA core remains empty. These findings can be useful in the rational design and development of amphiphilic copolymer-based drug-delivery systems.
