  Hashimoto 's encephalopathy ( HE) is a presumed autoimmune disorder associated with anti-thyroid autoantibodies and signs and symptoms of encephalopathy. A sub-type of HE is associated with cerebellar dysfunction and ataxia<symptom> Immunosuppressive therapy , particularly corticosteroid treatment , is utilized in the majority of cases. Short-term apheresis has been reported with variable patient responses. Here we report the case of a 72 year-old female with an ∼ 15 year history of cerebellar type HE that had profound improvement in symptoms after long-term apheresis treatment over an ∼ 2 year period. Following an induction phase , twice-weekly maintenance apheresis of 1 plasma volume reversed long-standing severe<symptom> gait<symptom> ataxia<symptom> that had required a walker , as well as mild cognitive symptoms. This paralleled reductions in anti-thyroid antibody levels. Holidays from apheresis lasting several weeks and/or reductions in maintenance apheresis frequency to once per-week resulted in re-expression of ataxia<symptom> and cognitive impairments along with a rise in anti-thyroid antibody levels. An apheresis dose-effect was observed whereby parallel rise and fall in both symptomatology and antibody levels would mirror duration between apheresis intervals. To our knowledge , this is the first report of profound therapeutic benefit and a dose-response relationship to long-term apheresis in cerebellar-type HE. This case suggests that maintenance apheresis be considered in responsive patients , particularly in those with contraindications to medical immunosuppression.
