  Seabirds are widely used as bioindicators of mercury ( Hg) contamination in marine ecosystems and the investigation of their foraging strategies is of key importance to better understand methylmercury ( MeHg) exposure pathways and environmental sources within the different ecosystems. Here we report stable isotopic composition for both Hg mass-dependent ( e.g. Î´
