  Cerebral small vessel disease ( CSVD) comprises a variety of disorders affecting small arteries and microvessels of the brain , manifesting as white matter hyperintensities ( WMHs) , cerebral microbleeds ( CMBs) , and deep brain infarcts. In addition to its contribution to vascular dementia ( VaD) , it has also been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). A systematic review of the literature available on Medline , Embase and Pubmed was undertaken , whereby CSVD was divided into WMHs , CMBs and deep brain infarcts. Biomarkers of AD pathology in the cerebrospinal fluid or plasma , or positron emission tomographic imaging for amyloid and/or tau deposition were used for AD pathology. A total of 4117 articles were identified and 41 articles met criteria for inclusion. These consisted of 17 articles on vascular risk factors for clinical AD , 21 articles on Aβ pathology and 15 articles on tau pathology , permitting ten meta-analyses. CMBs or lobar CMBs were associated with pooled relative risk ( RR) of AD at 1.546 , ( 95 % CI 0.842-2.838 , z = 1.41 p = 0.160) and 1.526 ( 95 % CI 0.760-3.063 , z = 1.19 , p = 0.235) respectively , both non-significant. Microinfarcts were associated with significantly increased AD risk , with pooled odds ratio OR at 1.203 ( 95 % CI 1.014-1.428 , 2.12 p = 0.034). Aβ pathology was significantly associated with WMHs in AD patients but not in normal age-matched controls. The pooled β ( linear regression) for total WMHs with CSF Aβ42 in AD patients was -0.19 ( 95 % CI -0.26-0.11 , z = 4.83 p = 0.000) and the pooled r ( correlation coefficient) for WMHs and PiB in the normal population was -0.10 ( 95 % CI -0.11-0.30 , 0.93 p = 0.351). CMBs were significantly associated with Aβ pathology in AD patients. The pooled standardized mean difference ( SMD) was -0.453 , 95 % CI -0.697- -0.208 , z = 3.63 p = 0.000. There was no significant relationship between the incidence of lacunes and levels of CSFAβ , with a pooled β of 0.057 ( 95 % CI -0.050-0.163 , z = 1.05 p = 0.295). No significant relationship was found between CMBs and the levels of CSFt-tau/CSFp-tau in AD patients ( -0.014 , 95 % CI -0.556-0.529 , z = 0.05 p = 0.960; -0.058 , 95 % CI -0.630-0.515 , z = 0.20 p = 0.844) and cortical CMBs and CSF p-tau in the normal population ( 0.000 , 95 % CI -0.706-0.706 , z = 0.00 p = 0.999). Some CSVD markers were significantly associated with clinical AD pathology and may be associated with Aβ/tau pathology. WMHs and microinfarcts were associated with increased risk of AD. It remains unclear whether they precede or follow AD pathology.
