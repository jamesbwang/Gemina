  Oxidative stress is a major source of reactive carbonyl compounds that can damage cellular macromolecules , leading to so-called carbonyl stress. Aside from endogenously formed carbonyls , including highly reactive short-chain aldehydes and diketones , air pollutants derived from diesel exhaust like 9,10-phenanthrenequinone ( PQ) can amplify oxidative stress by redox cycling , causing tissue damage. Carbonyl reductases ( CRs) , which are inducible in response to ROS , represent a fundamental enzymatic defense mechanism against oxidative stress. While commonly two carbonyl reductases ( CBR1 and CBR3) are found in mammalian genomes , invertebrate model organisms like Drosophila melanogaster express no CR but a functional homolog to human CBR1 , termed sniffer. The microcrustacean Daphnia is an ideal model organism to investigate the function of CRs because of its unique equipment with even four copies of the CR gene ( CR1 , CR2 , CR3 , CR4) in addition to one sniffer gene. Cloning and catalytic characterization of two carbonyl reductases CR1 and CR3 from D. magna<pathogen> and D. pulex arenata revealed that both proteins reductively metabolize aromatic dicarbonyls ( e.g. , menadione , PQ) and aliphatic Î±-diketones ( e.g. , 2,3-hexanedione) , while sugar-derived aldehydes ( methylglyoxal , glyoxal) and lipid peroxidation products such as acrolein and butanal were poor substrates , indicating no physiological function in the metabolism of short-chain aldehydes. Treatment of D. magna<pathogen> with redox cyclers like menadione and the pesticide paraquat led to an upregulation of CR1 and CR3 mRNA , suggesting a role in oxidative stress defense. Further studies are needed to investigate their potential to serve as novel biomarkers for oxidative stress in Daphnia.
