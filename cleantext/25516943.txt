  What is good bioethics? Addressing this question is key for reinforcing and developing the field. In particular , a discussion of potential quality criteria can heighten awareness and contribute to the quality of bioethics publications. Accordingly , the objective of this article is threefold: first , we want to identify a set of criteria for quality in bioethics. Second , we want to illustrate the added value of a novel method: in-depth analysis of a single article with the aim of deriving quality criteria. The third and ultimate goal is to stimulate a broad and vivid debate on goodness in bioethics. An initial literature search reveals a range of diverse quality criteria. In order to expand on the realm of such quality criteria , we perform an in-depth analysis of an article that is acclaimed for being exemplary. The analysis results in eleven specific quality criteria for good bioethics in three categories: argumentative , empirical , and dialectic. Although we do not claim that the identified criteria are universal or absolute , we argue that they are fruitful for fueling a continuous constitutive debate on what is `` good bioethics. '' Identifying , debating , refining , and applying such criteria is an important part of defining and improving bioethics.
