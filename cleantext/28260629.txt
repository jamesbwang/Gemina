  Dasatinib ( DAS) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI) used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia<disease> and in the management of ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC). Since some nutraceuticals ( e.g. curcumin , olive oil , and cocoa extract) could alter the function of ABC transporters and/ or CYP450 enzymes , DAS bioavailability could potentially be affected following their co-administration. This work aims at studying the possibility of PK interaction between DAS and the selected nutraceuticals in UC rats using UPLC- MS/MS. Chromatographic analysis was carried out using BEH C 18 column ( Waters) with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 50 % aqueous methanol , 65:35 , v/v , each with 0.1 % formic acid and using erlotinib ( ERL) as an internal standard ( IS). DAS quantitation was carried out using multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM) with positive ionization of the transitions at m/z 488.03 > 400.92 ( DAS) , and m/z 394.29 > 278.19 ( ERL). Method validation was assessed as per the FDA guidelines for bioanalytical methods for DAS determination within the concentration range 1-500 ng/mL. No significant effect on the oral bioavailability of DAS was reported with any of the studied nutraceuticals. Thus , the concomitant administration of these nutraceuticals with DAS could be considered safe with a necessity to perform more detailed clinical investigations.
