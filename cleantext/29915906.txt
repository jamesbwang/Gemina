  To observe the immediate effect and safety of Shexiang Tongxin dropping pills ( , STDP) on patients with coronary slow flow ( CSF) , and furthermore , to explore new evidence for the use of Chinese medicine in treating ischemic chest<symptom> pain<symptom>. Coronary angiography ( CAG) with corrected thrombolysis in myocardial infarction ( TIMI) frame count ( CTFC) was applied ( collected at 30 frames/s). The treatment group included 22 CSF patients , while the control group included 22 individuals with normal coronary flow. CSF patients were given 4 STDP through sublingual administration , and CAG was performed 5 min after the medication. The immediate blood flow frame count , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and heart rate of patients before and after the use of STDP were compared. The liver and kidney functions of patients were examined before and after treatments. There was a significant difference in CTFC between groups ( P < 0.05). The average CTFC values of the vessels with slow blood flow in CSF patients were , respectively , 49.98 ± 10.01 and 40.42 ± 11.33 before and after the treatment with STDP , a 19.13 % improvement. The CTFC values ( frame/s) measured before and after treatment at the left anterior descending coronary artery , left circumflex artery , and right coronary artery were , respectively , 48.00 ± 13.32 and 41.80 ± 15.38 , 59.00 ± 4.69 and 50.00 ± 9.04 , and 51.90 ± 8.40 and 40.09 ± 10.46 , giving 12.92 % , 15.25 % , and 22.76 % improvements , respectively. The CTFC values of vessels with slow flow before treatment were significantly decreased after treatment ( P < 0.05). There were no apparent changes in the heart rate , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , or liver or kidney function of CSF patients after treatment with STDP ( all P > 0.05). The immediate effect of STDP in treating CSF patients was apparent. This medication could significantly improve coronary flow without affecting blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> or heart rate. Our findings support the potential of Chinese medicine to treat ischemic
