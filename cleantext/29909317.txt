  Through a 60-day microcosm incubation , the effect of 3 , 4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate ( DMPP) on the activities and abundances of ammonia-oxidizers and denitrifiers in phenanthrene-polluted soil was investigated. Five treatments were conducted for clean soil ( CK) , phenanthrene added ( P) , phenanthrene and DMPP added ( PD) , phenanthrene and urea added ( PU) , and phenanthrene , urea , and DMPP added ( PUD) soils. The results indicate that the potential nitrification rate ( PNR) in the P treatment was significantly higher than that in the PD treatment only on day 7 , whereas the PNR in the PU treatment was significantly higher than that in the PUD treatment on each sampling day. The abundance of soil ammonia-oxidizing bacteria ( AOB) in the PU treatment was significantly higher than that in the PUD treatment on each sampling day. Moreover , the abundance of AOB but rather than the ammonia-oxidizing archaea ( AOA) had significantly positive correlation with soil PNR ( P < 0.05). DMPP showed no obvious effect on the soil denitrification enzyme activity ( DEA) , which could have inhibited the abundances of denitrification-related narG , nirS , and nirK genes. The results of this study should provide a deeper understanding of the interaction between soil polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH) contamination , ammonia<pathogen> oxidization , and denitrification , and offer valuable information for assessing the potential contribution of denitrification for soil PAH elimination.
