  Microbial communities ( microbiota) influence human and animal disease and immunity , geochemical nutrient cycling and plant productivity. Specific groups , including bacteria , archaea , eukaryotes or fungi<pathogen> , are amplified by PCR to assess the relative abundance of sub-groups ( e.g. genera). However , neither the absolute abundance of sub-groups is revealed , nor can different amplicon families ( i.e. OTUs derived from a specific pair of PCR primers such as bacterial 16S , eukaryotic 18S or fungi<pathogen> ITS) be compared. This prevents determination of the absolute abundance of a particular group and domain-level shifts in microbiota abundance can remain undetected. We have developed absolute quantitation of amplicon families using synthetic chimeric DNA spikes. Synthetic spikes were added directly to environmental samples , co-isolated and PCR-amplified , allowing calculation of the absolute abundance of amplicon families ( e.g. prokaryotic 16S , eukaryotic 18S and fungal ITS per unit mass of sample). Spikes can be adapted to any amplicon-specific group including rhizobia from soils , Firmicutes and Bifidobacteria from human gut or Enterobacteriaceae from food samples. Crucially , using highly complex soil samples , we show that the absolute abundance of specific groups can remain steady or increase , even when their relative abundance decreases. Thus , without absolute quantitation , the underlying pathology , physiology and ecology of microbial groups may be masked by their relative abundance.
