  The practice of starving patients in the immediate period after upper gastrointestinal surgery is widespread. Early oral intake has been shown to be feasible and may result in faster recovery and decrease length of hospital. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of oral nutrition on postoperative early feeding after upper gastrointestinal surgeries. Observational cohort design study with convenience retrospective data in both genders , over 18 years , undergoing to total gastrectomy and/or elective esophagectomy. They have received oral or enteral nutrition in less than 48 h after surgery , and among those who started with enteral nutrition , the oral feeding up to seven days. The study was performed in 161 patients , 24 ( 14.9 %) submitted to esophagectomy , 132 ( 82 %) to total gastrectomy and five ( 3.1 %) to esophagogastrectomy. Was observed good dietary acceptance and low percentage ( 29 %) of gastrointestinal intolerances , more pronounced among those with enteral diet. Most of the patients did not present postoperative complications , 11 ( 6.8 %) were reopened , five ( 3.1 %) had fistulas<disease> , three ( 1.9 %) wound<disease> dehiscence , three ( 1.9 %) fistula<disease> more wound<disease> dehiscence and six ( 3.7 %) other non-infectious complications. Early oral diet is safe and viable for patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal surgery.
