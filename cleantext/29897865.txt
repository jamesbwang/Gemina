  Speed modulation requires spatiotemporal adjustments and altered neural drive to different muscles. The loss of certain muscles produces changes in the locomotor pattern and functional compensation. However , how the loss of specific muscles affects speed modulation has not been specifically investigated. Here , we denervated the lateral-gastrocnemius and soleus muscles unilaterally in seven cats that had recovered hindlimb locomotion following complete spinal transection ( spinal cats). Hindlimb locomotion was tested at ten speeds , from 0.1 to 1.0 m/s , before , 1-2 days and 1-8 weeks after denervation. Six of seven cats performed hindlimb locomotion 1-2 days post-denervation at all speeds , with the exception of two out of those six cats that did not perform stable stepping at 0.9 and 1.0 m/s. All seven cats performed hindlimb locomotion 1-8 weeks post-denervation at all speeds. In some cats , at 1-2 days post-denervation , the ipsilateral hindlimb performed more steps than the contralateral hindlimb , particularly at slow speeds. This 2:1 coordination disappeared over time. In three cats , the linear increase in the amplitude of the electromyography of the ipsilateral medial gastrocnemius was reduced with increasing speed early after denervation before recovering later on. Overall , the results indicate that spinal circuits interacting with sensory feedback from the hindlimbs compensate for the partial<symptom> loss<symptom> of ankle extensors , retaining the ability to modulate locomotor speed.
