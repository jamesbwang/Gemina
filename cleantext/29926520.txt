  Cubosomes are highly stable nanoparticles formed from the lipid cubic phase and stabilized by a polymer based outer corona. Lipid cubic phases consist of a single lipid bilayer which forms a continuous periodic membrane lattice structure with pores formed by two interwoven water channels. Cubosome composition can be tuned to engineer pore sizes or include bioactive lipids , the polymer outer corona can be used for targeting and they are highly stable under physiological conditions. The structure provides a significantly higher membrane surface area for loading of membrane proteins and small drug molecules than liposomes. Due to recent advances , they can be engineered in vitro in both bulk and nanoparticle formats with applications including drug delivery , membrane bioreactors , artificial cells and biosensors. This review outlines recent advances in cubosome technology enabling their application and provides guidelines for the rational design of new systems for biomedical applications.
