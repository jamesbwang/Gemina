  Cancer is a complex<disease> disease<disease> caused by combinations of cellular genetic alterations and heterogeneous microenvironments. The use of the robust and programmable CRISPR-Cas systems has greatly improved genome editing for precision cancer modeling and enabled multiplexed genetic manipulation for cancer treatment and mutation detection. In this review , we outline the current CRISPR-Cas toolkit , and discuss the promises and hurdles in translating this revolutionary technology into effective and safe clinical applications for cancer treatment and diagnosis.
