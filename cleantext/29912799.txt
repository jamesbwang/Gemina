  Prolactin-related adverse effects contribute to nonadherence and adverse health consequences , particularly in women with severe mental illness. Treating these adverse effects may improve treatment acceptability , adherence , and long-term outcomes. Premenopausal women with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition , Text Revision diagnosis of schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , or bipolar disorder were recruited for a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled 16-week trial of adjunct aripiprazole ( 5-15 mg/d). Participants had elevated prolactin ( > 24 ng/mL) and were experiencing galactorrhea , amenorrhea , oligomenorrhea , or sexual dysfunction on a prolactin-elevating antipsychotic. Participants were evaluated biweekly for prolactin elevation and galactorrhea and completed a menstrual diary review. Psychiatric symptoms and adverse effects were closely monitored. Forty-six women were randomized ( n = 25 aripiprazole , n = 21 placebo). Thirty-seven completed at least 8 weeks of the study ( n = 20 ( 80 %) aripiprazole and n = 17 ( 81 %) placebo). Aripiprazole ( mean dose , 11.7 ± 2.4 mg/d) was effective for lowering prolactin relative to placebo ( P = 0.04). In addition , 45 % ( 9/20) of the aripiprazole group had a normalized prolactin ( < 24 mg/mL) compared with 12 % ( 2/17) of the placebo group ( P = 0.028). Galactorrhea resolved in 77 % ( 10/13) of the aripiprazole-treated participants compared with 33 % ( 4/12) in the placebo group ( P = 0.028). Normalization of sexual function ( < 16 on the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale) occurred in 50 % on aripiprazole ( 7/14) versus 9 % ( 1/11) on placebo ( P = 0.030). No differences between groups in symptoms or adverse effects were noted. Overall , women rated a mean score of 4.6 ± 0.6 on a 5-point Likert scale for sexual function improvement , suggesting their particular satisfaction with improvement in this domain. Building upon prior studies , this rigorous evaluation confirms the utility of adjunctive aripiprazole as a strategy for improving prolactin and managing prolactin-related adverse effects in premenopausal women with psychosis.
