  This study aims to understand the degree to which ptosis<symptom> is recognizable to a layperson. Fifteen color drawings of a gender-neutral human face were created. Six faces exhibited right-sided ptosis<symptom> ( decreased margin reflex distance 1 and lengthened tarsal platform show) of 0.5 mm , 1 mm , 1.5 mm , 2 mm , 2.5 mm , and 3 mm , respectively. Six more faces exhibited left-sided ptosis<symptom> of the same amounts. The 12 ptotic faces and 3 symmetrical faces were randomly placed on three 11-inch by 14-inch sheets of paper with 5 faces on each page. Lay observers were provided 6 seconds per face to indicate whether it appeared to be asymmetrical. Statistical tests examined the observers ' ability to detect asymmetry better than chance. Sex differences in correctly recognizing asymmetry in ptosis<symptom> at each 0.5 mm increment were analyzed. One hundred thirty-one lay observers were enrolled in the study. Fifty-seven were women and 74 were men. Lay people were able to correctly recognize ptosis<symptom> better than chance when the asymmetry was 1.5 mm or greater. Moreover , females were more accurate in recognizing ptosis<symptom> at 1.5 mm , 2.0 mm , and 2.5 mm of asymmetry. Lay observers tend to recognize between 1.0 mm and 1.5 mm of ptosis<symptom> on one side as being abnormal. This may have implications in the selection of candidates for ptosis<symptom> surgery and the analysis of subsequent surgical outcomes.
