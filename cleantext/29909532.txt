  China is one of three global hotspots for nitrogen ( N) deposition , which has concerned scientists and the public. While previous studies on N deposition in China have focused on its composition , spatial pattern , and interannual dynamics , its monthly dynamics in different regions remain unclear , hindering our ability to evaluate its ecological effects. Therefore , we obtained monthly wet N deposition data from196 sites after continuous network observations and published data in China and analyzed the monthly dynamics of NH
