  African rhinoceros are poached for their horns using indiscriminate and aggressive methods. Rhinoceros that survive these attacks often have severe facial trauma , and treatment is limited by a lack of understanding and published information of the normal anatomy. This study was performed to investigate and describe the anatomy of the most commonly injured area of the head of the white rhinoceros ( Ceratotherium simum). Two white rhinoceros cadaver heads were imaged by computed tomography and grossly dissected. A combined dorsal conchal sinus and nasal sinus ( named the nasoconchal sinus) was identified and confirmed to be readily exposed by horn removal. The nasoconchal sinus communicates via a relatively large opening with the middle nasal meatus of the nasal cavity. Awareness of the combined sinus space and its single communicating pathway will assist with accurate assessment and treatment of trauma to the dorsal facial region of the white rhinoceros.
