  The aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the performance of the chimney ( ch) technique in the treatment of type Ia endoleaks after standard endovascular aneurysm<disease> repair ( EVAR). Between January 2008 and December 2014 , 517 chEVAR procedures were performed in 13 US and European vascular centers ( PERICLES registry). Thirty-nine patients ( mean age 76.9 Â± 7.1 years; 33 men) were treated for persistent type Ia endoleak and had computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography follow-up at > 1 month. Endurant abdominal stent-grafts were used in the 20 cases. Single chimney graft placement was performed in 18 ( 46 %) patients and multiple in 21 ( 54 %). Overall , 70 visceral vessels were targeted for revascularization. Technical success was achieved in 35 ( 89.7 %) cases; 3 persistent type Ia endoleaks and 1 chimney graft occlusion were detected within the first 30 days. Thirty-day mortality was 2.6 %. Two other deaths ( not aneurysm<disease> related) occurred during a mean follow-up of 21.9 months ( 0.23-71.3). Primary patency of the chimney grafts was 94.3 % at 36 months. In a subgroup analysis comparing Endurant to other stent-grafts , no significant differences were observed regarding persistent endoleak ( 1/20 ( 5 %) vs 2/19 ( 11 %) , p = 0.6) or reintervention ( 1/20 ( 5 %) vs 0/19 ( 0 %)). The present series demonstrates that chEVAR in the treatment of post-EVAR type Ia endoleaks has satisfactory results independent of the abdominal and chimney graft combinations. Midterm results show that chEVAR is an effective method for treating type Ia endoleaks.
