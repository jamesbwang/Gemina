  The diacylglycerol kinase Î· gene ( DGKH) is one of the few replicated risk genes for bipolar disorder. Meanwhile , specific personality traits , especially openness to experience , have been suggested as premorbid personality traits of the disorder. The aim of the present study was to examine the relation of the DGKH genotype with broad dimensions of personality , to obtain further evidence for its implication in the etiology of bipolar disorder. The subjects were 319 Japanese healthy volunteers. Personality was assessed by the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised , which has the neuroticism , extraversion , openness to experience , agreeableness and conscientiousness dimensions. The A/G polymorphism of DGKH ( rs9525580) was detected by a PCR-RFLP method. The subjects were divided into two groups with respect to the presence or absence of the A allele , which is a putative risk allele for bipolar disorder. The group with the A allele had significantly ( p < 0.05) higher scores of openness to experience compared to that without this allele. Scores of other dimensions were not different between the two groups. The subjects had a homogeneous but rather specific background , and we did not employ a longitudinal design. The present study shows that a bipolar-risk allele of DGKH is associated with higher openness to experience , providing further evidence for the implication of this gene in the etiology of bipolar disorder.
