  adrenal tumor-to-liver uptake value ( Tmx: Lmx) on 2010-2015: 73 patients who underwent adrenalectomy for adrenocortical tumors ( 49 secreting/ ( SA) and 24 non-secreting/ ( NSA)) were retrospectively included in the study. Fourteen were malignant. All patients underwent hormonal evaluation , functional and anatomical imaging , Weiss scoring and Ki 67 evaluation. malignant tumors exhibit higher SUVmax than benign tumors ( median 7.75 vs 3.06 respectively , p < 0.001) and Tmx: Lmx was 2.7 vs 1.17 for benign tumors , p < 0.001. Tmx: Lmx was positively correlated to Weiss score ( p < 0.001). No significant difference was observed for Tmx: Lmx between SA and NSA overall ( p = 0.851) , regardless of the subgroup of tumors analyzed. Tmx: Lmx was not correlated to tumor size ( p < 0.508) or 24 h free urinary cortisol level ( p < 0.522). no correlation was observed between Tmx: Lmx and hormonal status , however the correlation between ratio , malignancy and Weiss score confirm the utility of
