  A new method to label fucoidan sulfate was established with tyramine and fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I ( FITC). The fluorescence spectrophotometry and high performance liquid chromatography verified the successful labelling of fucoidan by FITC. The results of the single-pass intestinal perfusion indicated jejunum<symptom> and ileum as the main absorption sites , and there was carrier saturation. In addition , fucoidan sulfate at 1 mg/mL had no inhibitory effect on Caco-2 cell proliferation. Studies on the transmembrane transport mechanism showed that fucoidan can be absorbed because the apparent permeability coefficient of drugs ( P
