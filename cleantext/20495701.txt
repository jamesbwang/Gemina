  We report a patient that had a prior radical prostatectomy and negative PSA levels for two years and subsequently developed bladder cancer requiring radical cystectomy with mixed lymph nodes on final pathology. The nodes were found to be positive for both metastatic urothelial cell carcinoma and metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma based on immunohistochemical staining. Treatment for metastatic bladder cancer was pursued after radical cystectomy recovery.
