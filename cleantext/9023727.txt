  α-synuclein abnormal accumulation and mitochondria dysfunction are involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson 's disease. Selective autophagy of mitochondria ( mitophagy) is a crucial component of the network controlling the mitochondrial homeostasis. However , the underlying mechanism that mutant α-synuclein induces mitochondrial abnormality through mitophagy impairment is not fully understood. Here , we showed that mutant A53T α-synuclein accumulation impaired mitochondrial function and Parkin-mediated mitophgy in α-synucleinA53T model. α-synucleinA53T overexpression caused p38 MAPK activation , then p38 MAPK directly phosphorylated Parkin at serine 131 to disrupt the Parkin 's protective function. The p38 MAPK inhibition significantly reduced cellular apoptosis , restored mitochondrial membrane potential as well as increased synaptic density both in SN4741 cells and primary midbrain neurons. These findings show that the p38 MAPK-Parkin signaling pathway regulates mitochondrial homeostasis and neuronal degeneration , which may be a potential therapeutic strategy of PD via enhancing mitochondrial turn-over and maintenance.
