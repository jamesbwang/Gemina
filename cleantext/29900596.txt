  Lithium ( Li) metal anodes have attracted much interest recently for high-energy battery applications. However , low coulombic efficiency , infinite volume change , and severe dendrite formation limit their reliable implementation over a wide range. Here , an outstanding stability for a Li metal anode is revealed by designing a highly porous and hollow Li foam. This unique structure is capable of tackling many Li metal problems simultaneously: first , it assures uniform electrolyte distribution over the inner and outer electrode 's surface; second , it reduces the local current density by providing a larger electroactive surface area; third , it can accommodate volume expansion and dissipate heat efficiently. Moreover , the structure shows superior stability compared to fully Li covered foam with low porosity , and bulky Li foil electrode counterparts. This Li foam exhibits small overpotential ( â‰ˆ 25 mV at 4 mA cm
