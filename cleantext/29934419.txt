  Infective endocarditis<disease> ( IE) after transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation ( TPVI) in dysfunctioning right ventricular outflow tract conduits has evoked growing concerns. We aimed to investigate the incidence and the natural history of IE after TPVI with the Melody valve through a systematic review of published data. PubMed , EMBASE , and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for articles published until March 2017 , reporting on IE after TPVI with the Melody valve. Nine studies ( including 851 patients and 2060 patient-years of follow-up) were included in the analysis of the incidence of IE. The cumulative incidence of IE ranged from 3.2 % to 25.0 % , whereas the annualized incidence rate ranged from 1.3 % to 9.1 % per patient-year. The median ( interquartile range) time from TPVI to the onset of IE was 18.0 ( 9.0-30.4) months ( range , 1.0-72.0 months). The most common findings were positive blood culture ( 93 %) , fever<disease> ( 89 %) , and new , significant , and/or progressive right ventricular outflow tract obstruction ( 79 %); vegetations were detectable on echocardiography in only 34 % of cases. Of 69 patients with IE after TPVI , 6 ( 8.7 %) died and 35 ( 52 %) underwent surgical and/or transcatheter reintervention. Death or reintervention was more common in patients with new/significant right ventricular outflow tract obstruction ( 69 % versus 33 %; The incidence of IE after implantation of a Melody valve is significant , at least over the first 3 years after TPVI , and varies considerably between the studies. Although surgical/percutaneous reintervention is a common consequence , some patients can be managed medically , especially those with streptococcal infection and no right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
