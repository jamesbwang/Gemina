  The aim of this study was to investigate whether drug-coated balloon ( DCB) treatment is effective for de novo coronary lesions<symptom> that are unsuitable for drug-eluting stent ( DES) implantation.Methods and Results: This retrospective study included 118 de novo lesions<symptom> that were not suitable for DES implantation. Of the lesions<symptom> , 40 % was treated because of very small vessel disease. Patients with planned non-cardiac surgery and at high bleeding risk were 3 % and 19 % , respectively , and lesions<symptom> that easily develop stent fracture comprised 26 %. Clinically driven target lesion<symptom> revascularization ( TLR) was the primary endpoint. The rate of suboptimal lesion<symptom> preparation before DCB treatment was set as the secondary endpoint. Optimal lesion<symptom> preparation was defined as acquisition of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3 , minor coronary dissection , and residual stenosis â‰¤ 30 %. The rate of suboptimal lesion<symptom> preparation was 2.5 % and 3 patients needed bail-out stenting. Accordingly , 115 patients were treated with a DCB. Clinically driven TLR had occurred in 8 patients ( 7.0 %) at the 8-month follow-up. The presence of chronic total occlusion was identified as an independent predictor for TLR ( odds 11.57; 95 % confidence interval , 1.38-135.54; P = 0.02). For lesions<symptom> that are unsuitable for stent implantation , stent-less intervention using a DCB should be considered initially. The present study also highlighted that lesion<symptom> preparation is key to a successful DCB strategy.
