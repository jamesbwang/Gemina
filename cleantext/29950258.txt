  To describe epidemiology , clinical features and clinical consequences of Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI) in children. Case series. Paraplegic Centre , Hayatabad , Peshawar , from July 2011 to March 2017. SCI patients having age up to 15 years , admitted to Paraplegic Centre , were inducted in 2017. Exclusion criteria was foreign-national SCI patients , and/or SCI patients re-admitted to paraplegic centre. List of all SCI patients admitted to the centre was retrieved and 102 patients were identified. Data of these patients was evaluated for demographic information , physiological intactness ( complete SCI/incomplete SCI) , neurological level and complications. A total of 102 patients ( 66 males and 36 females) with mean age 10.9 Â± 3.7 years were included in this study. Firearm injury was the most common cause ( n = 39 , 38.2 %) of SCI in these patients , followed by fall from height ( n = 23 , 22.5 %) , road traffic accidents ( n = 14 , 13.7 %) , and weight fallen over ( n = 14 , 13.7 %). Bomb blast injury ( n = 7 , 6.9 %) , diving accident ( n = 3 , 2.9 %) , and sports related injuries ( n = 2 , 2.0 %). Majority of the patients ( n = 82 , 80.4 %) had complete SCI ( ASIA A); the commonest SCI level was thoracic region ( n = 59 , 57.8 %) and the least reported region was ( n = 14 , 13.7 %) cervical. Out of the total , 50 ( 49.0 %) patients had pressure ulcer<disease> in which 15 ( 30.0 %) patients were having grade IV pressure ulcer<disease> , 9 ( 18.0 %) , 15 ( 30.0 %) and 11 ( 22.0 %) patients were had grade I , grade II and grade III pressure ulcer<disease> , respectively. Majority of causes of SCI in children are similar to those reported in adult population. However , the commonest causes of SCI in children in Pakistan were firearm injury and bomb blast , which are rarely reported in other countries. Like adult population , these children with SCI are prone to developing pressure
