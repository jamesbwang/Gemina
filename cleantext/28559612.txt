  The effect of calcium impregnation on drip loss , colour , mechanical properties , sensory perception and freezing time on frozen-thawed papaya was studied , evaluating different freezing methods: cryogenic , tunnel and household freezer freezing. Osmotic dehydration<symptom> as pre-treatment was also evaluated. Freezing in liquid nitrogen was considered an inappropriate method for papaya preservation due to cracking. Calcium impregnation and osmotic dehydration<symptom> increased tissue firmness and decreased freezing time ( freezing time for fresh , calcium impregnated and osmo-dehydrated fruit was 23 , 17 and 5 min in a tunnel and 118 , 83 and 60 min in a household freezer , respectively). Calcium lactate was the most effective way to protect tissue 's firmness before and after a freeze-thaw cycle ( maximum stress values approx. 300-400 % of the raw tissue for tunnel freezing and 260 % for household freezer). Microstructure analysis showed better tissue integrity retention in papaya samples impregnated with calcium lactate than in those with calcium gluconate , after a freezing-thawing cycle , in agreement with the drip loss results. In spite of these results , consumers preferred frozen papaya without pre-treatment or impregnated with calcium gluconate.
