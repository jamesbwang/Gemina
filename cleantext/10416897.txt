  Mandibular defects lead to severe deformation and functional deficiency. Vascularized osteocutaneous tissue has been widely used to reconstruct the mandible. However , it is technically challenging to shape this type of grafts in such a manner that they resemble the configuration of the mandible. A 48-year-old female patient who underwent anterolateral thigh ( ALT) flap coverage after a tongue cancer excision was diagnosed with a tumor recurrence during the follow-up. A wide excision mandibulectomy and mandibular reconstruction with an ALT flap and a titanium implant were performed. The prefabricated titanium implant was fixed to the condyle. Then , an ALT flap was harvested from the ipsilateral thigh and anastomosed. After confirming that the circulation of the flap was intact , the implant was fixed to the parasymphysis. On the radiograph taken after the surgery , the prosthesis was well positioned and overall facial shape was acceptable. There was no postoperative complication during the follow-up period , 1 year and 2 months. The prefabricated implant allows the restoration of facial symmetry without harvesting autologous bone and it is a safe and effective surgical option for mandibular reconstruction.
