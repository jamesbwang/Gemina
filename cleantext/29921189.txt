  This study examined trends in hospitalizations of youths for behavioral health conditions in acute care hospital nonpsychiatric beds , acute care hospital psychiatric and detoxification beds , and specialty psychiatric hospitals. Using data on hospitalizations for behavioral health conditions in 2009 ( N = 21,805) and 2014 ( N = 27,550) from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database , this study examined the percentage of youths ( ages two to 18) with one or more hospitalizations , by demographic characteristic and bed type , and the behavioral health diagnoses for which patients were hospitalized. The greatest increase in hospitalizations of youths occurred in acute care hospital psychiatric and detoxification beds. The percentage of hospitalizations for suicidal ideation or self-harm injuries increased by 17.8 ( N = 526) to 30.0 ( N = 1,249) percentage points , depending on bed type. The continued trend of rising hospitalizations of youths is consistent with recent studies showing a doubling of hospitalizations of youths for suicide and self-harm.
