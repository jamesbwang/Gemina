  The growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance poses an increasingly serious threat to human health. Although an important driver of antibiotic resistance is the continuous exposure of bacteria to sublethal concentrations of antibiotics in natural environments , antibiotic pollutants are not currently tracked globally or systematically. This limits the international capacity to address the rise of antibiotic resistance at its source. To address this lack of data , the development of methods to measure antibiotic concentrations on-site is essential. These methods , ideally , must be sensitive to sublethal concentrations of antibiotics and require minimal technical expertise. Furthermore , factors such as cost , selectivity , biosafety and the ability to multiplex must be evaluated in the context of field use. Based on these criteria , we provide a critical review of current methods in antibiotic detection and evaluate their adaptability for use on-site. We categorize these methods into microbiological assays , physical and chemical assays , immunoassays , aptasensors and whole-cell biosensors. We recommend continued development of a dipstick or microfluidics approach with a bacterial promoter-based mechanism and colorimetric output. This technique would incorporate the advantageous aspects of existing methods , maximize shelf-life and ease-of-use , and require minimal resources to implement in the field.
