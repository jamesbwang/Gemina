  Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency have been reported in fibromyalgia. However , to the best of our knowledge , only one study has evaluated the role of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH) D supplementation on fibromyalgia symptoms. To analyze the effects of 3 months of 25 ( OH) D supplementation on symptoms of fibromyalgia. This study included 11 female patient. Demographic and clinical data , tender points , visual analog scale results , and pre- and post-serum levels of 25 ( OH) D supplementation were analyzed. The levels of 25 ( OH) D were measured by a radioimmunologic test. Patients with fibromyalgia diagnosis and 25 ( OH) D values â‰¤ 30 ng/ml were recruited to receive 50,000 IU of oral vitamin D once every week for 3 months. The disease was diagnosed based on the American College of Rheumatology criteria. The median age of all patients was 48.5 ( 28-67) years and 63.4 % were Caucasian. Disease duration varied from 1-10 years. The 25 ( OH) D levels increased significantly after 3 months , 18.4 ( 15.5-25.8) ng/ml vs. 33.8 ( 28-58) ng/ml , P = 0.01. Interestingly , an improvement of visual analog scale scores was observed at 3 months , 90 ( 0-100) vs. 30 ( 0-80) , P = 0.002. Eight patients ( 72.2 %) responded that they experienced a very significant improvement in symptoms. In addition , a trend for reduction of the number of tender points was observed after 3 months , 17 ( 11-18) vs. 10 ( 0-18) , P = 0.07. The 25 ( OH) D levels and disease symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia and vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency seem to improve with vitamin D supplementation.
