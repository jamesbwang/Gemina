  In this study , we developed a new immunosensor that can achieve an ultralow detection limit and high sensitivity. This new device has an electrokinetic trapping ( EKT)- based nanofluidic preconcentrator , which was integrated with oscillating bubble valves , to trap concentrated antigen and immunobeads. During the immunoassay process , oscillating bubbles rapidly grew and acted as control valves and to block the microchannel. Thereafter , the trapped preconcentrated antigen plug and antibody-coated nanobeads were preserved in the region between these two valves. Finally , the antigen concentration was quantitatively analyzed by a real-time measurement of Brownian diffusion of the immunobeads. In this work , the test sample used was C-reactive protein ( CRP) which is a risk indicator of coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis.
