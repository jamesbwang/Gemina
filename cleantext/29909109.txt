  This study sought to describe the impact of statins on individual coronary atherosclerotic plaques. Although statins reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events , their long-term effects on coronary atherosclerosis remain unclear. We performed a prospective , multinational study consisting of a registry of consecutive patients without history of coronary artery disease who underwent serial coronary computed tomography angiography at an interscan interval of ≥ 2 years. Atherosclerotic plaques were quantitatively analyzed for percent diameter stenosis ( % DS) , percent atheroma volume ( PAV) , plaque composition , and presence of high-risk plaque ( HRP) , defined by the presence of ≥ 2 features of low-attenuation plaque , positive arterial remodeling , or spotty calcifications. Among 1,255 patients ( 60 ± 9 years of age; 57 % men) , 1,079 coronary artery lesions<symptom> were evaluated in statin-naive patients ( n = 474) , and 2,496 coronary artery lesions<symptom> were evaluated in statin-taking patients ( n = 781). Compared with lesions<symptom> in statin-naive patients , those in statin-taking patients displayed a slower rate of overall PAV progression ( 1.76 ± 2.40 % per year vs. 2.04 ± 2.37 % per year , respectively; p = 0.002) but more rapid progression of calcified PAV ( 1.27 ± 1.54 % per year vs. 0.98 ± 1.27 % per year , respectively; p < 0.001). Progression of noncalcified PAV and annual incidence of new HRP features were lower in lesions<symptom> in statin-taking patients ( 0.49 ± 2.39 % per year vs. 1.06 ± 2.42 % per year and 0.9 % per year vs. 1.6 % per year , respectively; all p < 0.001). The rates of progression to > 50 % DS were not different ( 1.0 % vs. 1.4 % , respectively; p > 0.05). Statins were associated with a 21 % reduction in annualized total PAV progression above the median and 35 % reduction in HRP development. Statins were associated with slower progression of overall coronary atherosclerosis volume , with increased plaque calcification and reduction of high-risk plaque features. Statins did not affect the progression of percentage of stenosis severity of coronary artery lesions<symptom> but induced phenotypic plaque transformation.
