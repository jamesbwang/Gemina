  Chemical sterilization is a non-surgical method of contraception based on compounds injected into the testis to induce infertility<symptom>. However , these injections can cause discomfort and pain able to impair the recovery of animals after this treatment. The objective of this study was to investigate if anti-inflammatories or pain relievers inhibited the sterilizing effect of zinc gluconate-based solution on the testis. Adult rats were treated in groups: G1 ( control) , G2 ( dimethyl sulfoxide + dipyrone); G3 ( dipyrone/zinc); G4 ( dipyrone + celecoxib/zinc); G5 ( dipyrone + meloxicam/zinc) , and G6 ( dipyrone + dexamethasone/zinc) in a single dose per day during 7 days. Animals were analyzed at 7 , 15 , and 30 days after treatments. The zinc-induced a widespread testicular degeneration and decreased testosterone levels even in combination with anti-inflammatories or pain relievers. Testis , epididymis , prostate , and seminal vesicle had a weight reduction. The anti-inflammatory effect of dexamethasone interfered in the desired action of zinc gluconate in the 1 Meloxicam plus dipyrone did not impair the chemical sterilization based on zinc gluconate , and it can be used to reduce nociceptive effects in animals after chemical sterilization.
