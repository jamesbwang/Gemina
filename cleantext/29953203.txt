  Novel oppositely charged polyphosphazene polyelectrolytes containing grafted poly ( ethylene glycol) ( PEG) chains were synthesized as modular components for the assembly of biodegradable PEGylated protein delivery vehicles. These macromolecular counterparts , which contained either carboxylic acid or tertiary amino groups , were then formulated at near physiological conditions into supramolecular assemblies of nanoscale level , below 100 nm. Nanocomplexes with electroneutral surface charge , as assessed by zeta potential measurements , were stable in aqueous solutions , which suggests their compact polyelectrolyte complex `` core ''- hydrophilic PEG `` shell '' structure. Investigation of PEGylated polyphosphazene nanocomplexes as agents for noncovalent PEGylation of the therapeutic protein l-asparaginase ( L-ASP) in vitro demonstrated their ability to dramatically reduce protein antigenicity , as measured by antibody binding using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). Encapsulation in nanocomplexes did not affect enzymatic activity of L-ASP , but improved its thermal stability and proteolytic resistance. Gel permeation chromatography ( GPC) experiments revealed that all synthesized polyphosphazenes exhibited composition controlled hydrolytic degradability in aqueous solutions at neutral pH and showed greater stability at lower temperatures. Overall , novel hydrolytically degradable polyphosphazene polyelectrolytes capable of spontaneous self-assembly into PEGylated nanoparticulates in aqueous solutions can potentially enable a simple and effective approach to modifying therapeutic proteins without the need for their covalent modification.
