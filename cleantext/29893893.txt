  Stopping long-term nucleos ( t) ide analogue therapy increases HBsAg loss rates in HBeAg-negative patients. Viral rebound may induce immune responses facilitating functional cure. We analyzed which factors are associated with timing of virological relapse in 220 Asian HBeAg-negative patients from the prospective ABX203 vaccine study. Unexpectedly , only the type of antiviral therapy was significantly associated with early virological relapse , defined as HBV DNA > 2,000 IU/ml until week 12 and occurred earlier in patients treated with tenofovir versus entecavir ( median time 6 versus 24 weeks , p < 0.0001). This should be considered for future trials and monitoring of patients after treatment discontinuation.
