  Membrane-bound enzymes ( MBEs) , which make up a very high proportion of intracellular enzymes , catalyze a variety of activities that are currently analyzed by various techniques after purification. However , due to their amphipathic character , the purification of MBEs is difficult. Therefore , the most productive approach represents
