  The tetra-phenyl arsonium and tetra-phenyl borate ( TATB) assumption is a commonly used extra-thermodynamic assumption that allows single ion free energies to be split into cationic and anionic contributions. The assumption is that the values for the TATB salt can be divided equally. This is justified by arguing that these large hydrophobic ions will cause a symmetric response in water. Experimental and classical simulation work has raised potential flaws with this assumption , indicating that hydrogen bonding with the phenyl ring may favor the solvation of the TB
