  To compare the difference of mental health ( anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , loneliness , self-esteem , self-confidence , family life satisfaction) and the role of raising people 's identity in happiness relationship between two-parents family children and single parent family children by propensity score matching ( PSM). Datafrom Social Adaptation Database of National Children 's Study of China. Stratified and population-based cluster random sampling method was used to sample , a total of 23 499 subjects were 6-15 year-old children coming from 31 provinces of 100 districts and counties in mainland China. Then the PSM method was used to match 1203 children from two-parents and single parent family children. The data were analyzed by difference tests , variance analysis and regression analysis. There were significant differences in depression<symptom> ( 4. 46 ± 3. 234 vs. 5. 29 ± 3. 808 , P < 0. 001 , d = -0. 237) , self-esteem ( 27. 15 ± 4. 303 vs. 26. 05 ± 4. 838 , P < 0. 001 , d = 0. 241) and family life satisfaction ( 3. 23 ± 0. 570 vs. 3. 02 ± 0. 699 , P < 0. 001 , d = 0. 333) between two-parents and single parent family children in the condition of non-parental support after PSM. The effect of dependent status on depression<symptom> , family life satisfaction and well-being was statistically significant for the two-parents family children ( β = 0. 229 , β = -0. 239 , P < 0. 05). The simple slope test showed that the negative predictive effect of non-parental group on happiness was higher than that of parental group when depression<symptom> was the independent variable and well-being was the dependent variable ( parental group: simple slope = -0. 393 , t = -28. 98 , P < 0. 001; non-parental group: simple slope = -0. 321 , t = -13. 68 , P < 0. 001). The positive predictive effect of parental group on well-being was higher than that of non-parental group when family life satisfaction was the independent variable and well-being was dependent variable ( parental group: simple slope = 1. 474 , t = 15. 78 , P < 0. 001; non-parental group: simple slope = 1. 024 , t = 7. 03 , P < 0. 001). The mental health of two-parents family children is better than that of single parent family children , and children of non-parental supporters have more mental health disparity than that of parental supporters. Their family life satisfaction and depression<symptom> have a greater sense of effect on happiness for two-parents family children of parental supporter.
