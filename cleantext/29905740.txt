  A transverse-electric-mode focusing subwavelength grating coupler ( FSWGC) is proposed and demonstrated for dual-wavelength-band ( DWB) coupling from a single-mode fiber into a suspended-membrane waveguide for the first time , to the best of our knowledge. Location and separation of the two coupling peaks can be flexibly tailored based on a proposed design methodology. As a proof of concept , two DWB FSWGCs working at ( 1486.0 , 1594.5) nm and ( 1481.5 , 1661.5) nm are experimentally demonstrated with coupling efficiencies of ( 18.3 % , 20.1 %) and ( 14.5 % , 17.5 %) , 3-dB bandwidths of ( 55.0 , 30.5) nm and ( 44.0 , > 39.5) nm , respectively. A DWB FSWGC working at ( 1480 , 1830) nm with a wavelength separation of 350 nm and coupling efficiencies of ( 38.0 % , 33.2 %) is also numerically predicted.
