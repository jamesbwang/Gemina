  A major part of the genome is known to be transcribed into non-protein coding RNAs ( ncRNAs) , such as microRNA and long non-coding RNA ( lncRNA). The importance of ncRNAs is being increasingly recognized in physiological and pathological processes. lncRNAs are a novel class of ncRNAs that do not code for proteins and are important regulators of gene expression. In the past , these molecules were thought to be transcriptional `` noise '' with low levels of evolutionary conservation. However , recent studies provide strong evidence indicating that lncRNAs are ( i) regulated during various cellular processes , ( ii) exhibit cell type-specific expression , ( iii) localize to specific organelles , and ( iv) associated with human<disease> diseases<disease>. Emerging evidence indicates an aberrant expression of lncRNAs in diabetes and diabetes-related microvascular complications. In the present review , we discuss the current state of knowledge of lncRNAs , their genesis from genome , and the mechanism of action of individual lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of microvascular complications of diabetes and therapeutic approaches.
