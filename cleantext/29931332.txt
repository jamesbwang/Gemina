  An international team of scientists and veterinarians was assembled in 1999 to develop a monitoring program to determine the susceptibility of cat fleas , Ctenocephalides felis<pathogen> felis<pathogen> ( Bouché) ( Siphonaptera: Pulicidae) , to imidacloprid. Cat flea eggs were collected , shipped to laboratories , and tested for their susceptibility to imidacloprid. Over 3,000 C. felis<pathogen> populations were collected from 2002 to 2017 from 10 different countries. Of these , 66.3 % were collected from cats and 33.7 % from dogs. C. f. felis populations ( n = 2,200) were bioassayed by exposing cat flea eggs and the emerging larvae to a Diagnostic Dose ( DD) of 3 ppm imidacloprid in larval rearing medium. Flea eggs hatched and developed in the untreated controls in 1,837 of the isolates ( 83.5 %) bioassayed. Flea isolates ( n = 61) that had ≥ 5 % survival at the DD of 3 ppm were retested with a second DD of 3 ppm. None of them had ≥ 5 % survival to the second dose of 3 ppm. Of the 1,837 valid C. felis<pathogen> isolates tested , there has been no evidence of a decreased susceptibility to imidacloprid over the past 17 yr. The methods outlined in this article should provide an acceptable protocol for testing many of the new active ingredients that have been registered for cat flea control.
