  Solid-phase extraction coupled online with high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry was successfully applied to determine low concentrations of ceftiofur antibiotic in bovine milk samples. A silica-anchored ionic liquid was applied as sorbent material to be used as extraction phase in the proposed online system. The material was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. In order to improve the system reproducibility , the following experimental parameters were optimized: organic solvent percentage , time and sample loading flow rate. Subsequently , the method was validated presenting satisfactory results as adequate selectivity , good linearity and correlation coefficient higher than 0.98. The limit of detection and quantification were 0.1 and 0.7 Î¼g/L , respectively. The precision of the methodology was evaluated as repeatability and intermediate precision , with relative standard deviation values lower than 15 %. The accuracy of the method ranged from 72.8 to 137 % and the minimum and maximum recovery values were 73.4 and 111.3 % , respectively. After the validation , seven milk samples were analyzed and although ceftiofur was not detected in any of them the method was demonstrated to be efficient when applied to the analysis of milk samples fortified with the pollutant of interest.
