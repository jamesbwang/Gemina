  Simulation in obstetrics is a widely accepted and valuable tool that benefits all levels of learners from medical students to maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists. What began as an adjunct to medical education now has a rapidly expanding role in acquisition of new and innovative procedures , team and unit training , and safety and quality initiatives. The number of obstetric simulation peer-reviewed reports has increased exponentially in recent years , yet only a small percentage of reports primarily addresses clinical outcomes. Studies link simulation to a reduction in neonatal brachial plexus injury , maternal trauma related to forceps delivery , response to postpartum hemorrhage<symptom> , efficiency in performing emergent cesarean delivery , and neonatal mortality. Simulation is a required component in accredited obstetrics and gynecology residency training programs. Obstetric simulation has a role in the certification of physicians , and simulation hands-on courses may be used to meet maintenance of certification requirements. As simulation platforms are validated , they are likely to be incorporated into the certification process as a means of assessing technical and communication skills. Accrediting , certifying , professional , quality , and safety organizations have invested in simulation committees , interest groups , curricula , and continuing medical education courses. Support for research , including large multicenter trials , are needed to inform further implementation. Research and development should lead to lower costs and improved simulators. As the public , government , licensing , and credentialing institutions explore means of improving patient safety , expansion of simulation in obstetrics is inevitable.
