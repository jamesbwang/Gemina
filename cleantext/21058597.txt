  Static balance<symptom> has a relevant influence on athletic performance as well as on reducing the risk of injury. The main goal of this study was to assess soccer athlete versus non-athlete balance<symptom> performance via displacement and velocity parameters extracted from the center-of-pressure ( COP) position time series. In order to accomplish our goal , we investigated standing balance<symptom> in two male groups with unimpaired balance<symptom>: non-athletes (
