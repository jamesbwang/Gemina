  Young men who have sex with men ( YMSM) are disproportionally affected by HIV<pathogen> and exhibit low levels of HIV<pathogen> testing. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between sex education and subsequent HIV<pathogen> testing among YMSM. Data from sexually active men aged 15-24 years at interview in the 2006-2010 or 2011-2015 National Survey of Family Growth. Sex education included three contexts ( formal institutions ( e.g. , schools) , parents , and healthcare providers) and specific topics. Outcome variables were ever- and recent- HIV<pathogen> testing. Multivariate models adjusted for sociodemographics and data were weighted to account for the complex survey sampling design. A total of 323 sexually active YMSM met inclusion criteria. Overall , 42.4 % had ever-tested for HIV<pathogen> and 16.9 % tested in the previous 12 months. YMSM were more likely to have ever-tested for HIV<pathogen> if they talked with a parent/guardian about how to prevent HIV/AIDS ( adjusted prevalence ratio ( aPR) = 1.48; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.07-2.06) , talked with a healthcare provider about how HIV/AIDs is transmitted ( aPR = 1.64; 95 % CI: 1.13-2.38) , sexually transmitted diseases ( aPR = 1.49; 95 % CI: 1.02-2.19) , condom use ( aPR = 1.61; 95 % CI: 1.13-2.30) , and the importance of HIV<pathogen> testing ( aPR = 1.83; 95 % CI: 1.22-2.73). Tailored sex education by parent ( s) and healthcare providers related to HIV/AIDS appears to significantly increase the likelihood of HIV<pathogen> testing among YMSM.
