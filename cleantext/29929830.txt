  Leukemia<disease> is a deadly hematological malignancy that usually affects all age groups and imposes significant burden on public funds and society. The objective of this study was to analyze the cost of illness ( COI) of leukemia<disease> , and to mark out the underlying driving factors , in Japan. COI method was applied to the data from government statistics. We first summed up the direct and indirect costs from 1996 to 2014; then future COI for the year 2017-2029 was projected. Calculated COI showed an upward trend with a 13 % increase from 1996 to 2014 ( 270-305 billion yen). Increased COI was attributed to an increase in direct costs. Although mortality cost accounted for the largest proportion of COI , but followed a downward trend. Decreased mortality costs reflected the effects of aging. Mortality cost per person also decreased , however , the percentage of mortality cost for individuals â‰¥ 65 years of age increased consistently from 1996 to 2014. If a similar trend in health-related indicators continue , COI would remain stable from 2017 to 2029 regardless of models. COI of leukemia<disease> increased from 1996 to 2014 , but was projected to decrease in foreseeable future. With advancement of new therapies , leukemia<disease> has become potentially curable and require long-term care; so direct cost and morbidity cost will remain unchanged. This reveal the further continuing burden on public funds. Thus , the information obtained from this study can be regarded as beneficial to future policy making with respect to government policies in Japan.
