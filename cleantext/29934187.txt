  The present study is focused on heat-induced changes in the structure and antigenic properties of gluten proteins. The thermal dependent behavior of glutenins and gliadins was analyzed through intrinsic fluorescence parameters , phase diagram method , and quenching experiments using acrylamide and iodide. Unfolding events were registered in the phase diagram of glutenins up to 80 °C , followed by partial refolding and aggregation at even higher temperatures. The gliadins structure appeared to be progressively disorganized with the temperature increase up to 100 °C. The thermally denatured proteins exposed different functional groups leading to 64 % reduction of the antigenic properties. No significant differences in terms of residual antigenicity were observed among samples treated at temperatures over 60 °C for 20 or 60 min. Finally , changes in the linear epitopes exposure and location of conformational epitopes of α-/ β- , γ- and ω5-gliadins were highlighted after performing molecular dynamics simulations to heat the proteins from 25 °C to 100 °C.
