  Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes ( NRVMs) have proven to be an ideal research model for cardiac disease. However , the current methods to purify NRVMs have a limitation to obtain high purity. The purpose of this study was to develop a NRVM purification method by using superparamagnetic iron oxide particles ( SIOP). NRVMs were purified by using SIOP ( SIOP group). The differential attachment with or without bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU) treatment served as control and BrdU groups , respectively. The Percoll gradient ( Percoll) and magnetic-activated cell sorting ( MACS) methods were performed to compare the purity and viability of NRVMs with SIOP method. The SIOP group enriched NRVMs up to 93.9 ± 2.0 % purity determined by flow cytometry ( FCM) and 95.6 ± 1.3 % by immunofluorescence count ( IF). In contrast , the control group gave purities of 71.9 ± 2.9 % ( by FCM) and 66.8 ± 8.9 % ( by IF) , and the BrdU group obtained 82.0 ± 1.3 % ( by FCM) and 83.1 ± 2.4 % ( by IF). The purity of SIOP-isolated NRVMs was not different from that of Percoll and MACS groups. However , the cardiomyocytes separated by these methods , except SIOP protocol , were mixed with intrinsic cardiac adrenergic cells. NRVMs purified by SIOP shaped the similar three-dimensional morphology , with no difference in cell yield , viability and cytosolic Ca We first reported an efficient and novel method to purify NRVMs using SIOP , which may help accelerate innovative research in the field of cardiomyocyte biology.
