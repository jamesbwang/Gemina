  T follicular helper ( Tfh) cells are key players in the production of antibody-producing B cells Paired blood and lymph node ( LN) samples were obtained from 61 transplant recipients immediately prior to organ implantation. Living-donor recipients received a week of tacrolimus prior to kidney transplantation. Deceased-donor recipients served as controls , as tacrolimus was not administered until after the transplant operation. Flow cytometry was used to compare LN and circulating cell subsets. The calcineurin inhibitor ( CNIs) tacrolimus specifically suppresses both LN Tfh cells and circulating Tfh cells , but not their regulatory counterparts or other CD4 T cell subsets. Our findings suggest that CNIs may have a more important role in the prevention of antibody formation than previously understood and , therefore , have potential for antibody-associated conditions in which aberrant Tfh function has been implicated in disease.
