  To learn from the experiences of innovative primary care practices that have successfully developed care teams. A 2 1/2- day working conference was convened with representatives from 10 innovative primary care practices , content experts , and researchers to discuss experiences of developing care teams. Qualitative data included observation notes , transcripts of conference sessions and interviews , and narrative summaries of innovations. Case summaries of practices and an analysis matrix were created to identify common themes. Ten practices known nationally for innovations in team-based care participated in the conference represented by 1 to 2 practice members. Two domains emerged related to creating effective teams and funding them. Participants emphasized the importance of making practice values explicit and involving everyone in the change process , standardizing routine processes , and mitigating resistance. They also highlighted that team-based care adds comprehensiveness , not necessarily productivity. They , thus , highlighted the need for a long-term financial vision , including resourcefulness and alternate funding. Team-based care is possible and valuable in primary care. It is difficult to develop and sustain , however , and requires dedicated time and resources. The challenges these highly motivated practices described raise the question of feasibility for more average practices in the current funding environment.
