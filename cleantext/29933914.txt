  Exercise-induced circulating haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell ( HPC) number has been discussed in the context of regeneration in heart disease patients. The aim of this pilot study was to compare the effect of different exercise protocols usually applied in cardiac rehabilitation on the number of acute , exercise-induced HPCs , related to potential mediators , e.g. biomarkers of sympathetic and oxidative stress , and inflammation<symptom>. This is a case series comprising seven patients suffering from coronary heart disease ( CHD) undertaken at the Center for Ambulant Cardiac Rehabilitation. Patients ( n = 6) performed two exercise modes ( constant-load , CLE; high-intensity interval , HIIE) in randomised order. Venous blood was drawn before and immediately after each test to assess CD34 +/ CD45 + HPC number by flow cytometry and biomarkers in blood plasma. The primary outcome was the change in HPC number , the secondary outcomes were changes in sympathetic/oxidative stress and markers of inflammation<symptom>. Both exercise modes resulted in a non-significant increase in HPC number after exercise , even when the results of both tests were combined. Overall , free norepinephrine increased significantly and was positively related to exercise-induced HPC number ( r = 0.70 , p < 0.05). Markers of sympathetic activation ( fNE) , oxidative stress ( myeloperoxidase) and inflammation<symptom> ( interleukin-6) significantly increased after CLE and HIIE with no difference between tests. Interestingly , acute CLE and HIIE did not stimulate significant HPC mobilisation in CHD , although both exercise modes elevated circulating concentrations of sympathetic activation. Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell mobilisation could be blunted due to disease-related bone-marrow
