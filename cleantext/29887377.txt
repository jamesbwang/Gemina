  Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into a 3-dimensional structure in the nucleus. Current methods for studying genome-wide structure are based on proximity ligation. However , this approach can fail to detect known structures , such as interactions with nuclear bodies , because these DNA regions can be too far apart to directly ligate. Accordingly , our overall understanding of genome organization remains incomplete. Here , we develop split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension ( SPRITE) , a method that enables genome-wide detection of higher-order interactions within the nucleus. Using SPRITE , we recapitulate known structures identified by proximity ligation and identify additional interactions occurring across larger distances , including two hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions that are arranged around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles. We show that a substantial fraction of the genome exhibits preferential organization relative to these nuclear bodies. Our results generate a global model whereby nuclear bodies act as inter-chromosomal hubs that shape the overall packaging of DNA in the nucleus.
