  Seasonal influenza<disease> can have serious morbid consequences and can even result in death , particularly in at-risk populations , including healthcare professionals ( HCPs) , elderly and those living with a medical risk condition. Although in Europe recommendations exist for annual influenza<disease> vaccination in these populations in most countries , the vaccination coverage rate ( VCR) is often well below the World Health Organization target of 75 % coverage. In our previous survey in 2009 we showed that some elements of national vaccination policies , e.g. reminder systems , strong official recommendation , and easy access , seemed to contribute to achieving higher influenza<disease> VCRs among elderly. We repeated the survey in 2016 , using the same methodology to assess changes in influenza<disease> VCRs among the elderly and in the impact of policy elements on these VCRs. In addition , we collected information about VCRs among HCPs , and those living with a medical risk condition. The median VCR in the 21 countries that had recommendations for influenza<disease> vaccination in the elderly was 35.3 % , ranging from 1.1 % in Estonia to 74.5 % in Scotland. The average VCRs for HCPs and those living with medical risk conditions , available in 17 and 10 countries , respectively , were 28.3 % ( range 7 % in Czech Republic to 59.1 % in Portugal) and 32.2 % ( range from 20.0 % in the Czech Republic and Hungary to 59.6 % in Portugal) , respectively. Fewer countries were able to provide data from HCP and those living with medical risk conditions. Since the initial survey during the 2007-2008 influenza<disease> season , VCRs have decreased in the elderly in the majority of countries , thus , achieving high VCRs in the elderly and the other target groups is still a major public health challenge in Europe. This could be addressed by the identification , assessment and sharing of best practice for influenza<disease> vaccination policies.
