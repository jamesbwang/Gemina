  Titanate nanotubes ( TiONts) are promising agents for biomedical applications. Microglial activation and associated oxidative burst are major challenges in drug delivery applications across the brain. Here , TiONts were designed for drug delivery systems by functionalizing them with ( 3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane ( APTES) , their interactions and biocompatibility were studied in vitro using murine microglial BV-2 cells. TiONts-APTES exposure resulted in increased ROS production and transient mitochondrial hyperpolarization. However , there was no indication of microglial proliferation in BV-2 cells as suggested by cell cycle analysis and morphology evaluation. The endocytosis as well as passive diffusion mediated TiONts-APTES internalization were proved by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) with and without amiloride , an endocytosis inhibiting agent. In addition , the TiONts-APTES exhibited good biocompatibility on microglial BV-2 cells as revealed by the plasma membrane integrity , lysosmal membrane integrity , morphology and viability analysis.
