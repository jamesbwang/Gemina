  Given the rapid proliferation of trajectory-based approaches to study clinical consequences to stress and potentially traumatic events ( PTEs) , there is a need to evaluate emerging findings. This review examined convergence/divergences across 54 studies in the nature and prevalence of response trajectories , and determined potential sources of bias to improve future research. Of the 67 cases that emerged from the 54 studies , the most consistently observed trajectories following PTEs were resilience ( observed in: n = 63 cases) , recovery ( n = 49) , chronic ( n = 47) , and delayed onset ( n = 22). The resilience trajectory was the modal response across studies ( average of 65.7 % across populations , 95 % CI ( 0.616 , 0.698)) , followed in prevalence by recovery ( 20.8 % ( 0.162 , 0.258)) , chronicity ( 10.6 % , ( 0.086 , 0.127)) , and delayed onset ( 8.9 % ( 0.053 , 0.133)). Sources of heterogeneity in estimates primarily resulted from substantive population differences rather than bias , which was observed when prospective data is lacking. Overall , prototypical trajectories have been identified across independent studies in relatively consistent proportions , with resilience being the modal response to adversity. Thus , trajectory models robustly identify clinically relevant patterns of response to potential trauma , and are important for studying determinants , consequences , and modifiers of course following potential trauma.
