  Several factors including the parental literacy , illness , socioeconomic status , poor sanitation and hygienic practices affect the physical growth of children. The aim of this study was to determine the socio-demographic determinants of malnutrition among primary school aged children in Enugu , Nigeria. A cross-sectional descriptive study involving primary school children in Enugu was carried out over a 3 month period. Subjects were selected using multistage sampling technique. Weight and height were measured using a digital scale and a wooden stadiometer , respectively. Body Mass Index ( BMI) , weight-for-age ( WAZ) , Height-for-age ( HAZ) and BMI-for-age z scores were then derived using the new WHO reference standards. 348 children ( 40.4 %) were recruited from 5 public schools while 512 ( 59.6 %) were recruited from 9 private schools. The mean age of the study participants was 9.2 Â± 1.8 years. 7 ( 0.8 %) children were stunted , 26 ( 3.3 %) wasted and 28 ( 3.3 %) underweight. Of all the study participants , overweight and obesity were observed in 73 ( 8.5 %) and 35 ( 4.1 %) children , respectively. Children of lower socioeconomic class were more stunted , underweight and wasted , while overweight and obesity were more prevalent among children from the upper socioeconomic class. Factors such as age and sex , parental education and socioeconomic class had a significant impact on nutritional status. Overweight and obesity were more prevalent among the children from the upper socioeconomic class , attending private schools , while stunting and wasting were more in children of the lower class attending public schools.
