  To compare the pattern of gene-specific involvement and the spectrum of variants observed in prenatal and postnatal ( mean ± SD , 8.9 ± 9.4 years) cohorts tested for Noonan syndrome<disease> and related conditions. Outcomes of sequencing panel testing were compared between prenatal ( n = 845) and postnatal ( n = 409) cohorts. PTPN11 and SOS1 harbored the majority of observed variants in both prenatal and postnatal cohorts , and BRAF , HRAS , KRAS , MAP2K1 , MAP2K2 , RAF1 , and SHOC2 had similarities in their pattern of involvement in both cohorts. PTPN11 was the largest contributor of pathogenic variants and had the lowest frequency of variants of uncertain significance ( VUS). SOS1 had the highest VUS frequency in both cohorts. The overall VUS frequency was twice as high in prenatal specimens ( 58.1 vs. 29.3 %). PTPN11 and SOS1 had a 1.5-fold higher VUS frequency in the prenatal cohort ( 10.7 vs. 7.4 % and 95 vs. 61.1 % , respectively). The diagnostic yield was 3.7 % for prenatal samples , with a higher yield of 12.3 % in fetuses with cystic hygroma as a sole finding , and 21.3 % for postnatal. Comparison of prenatal versus postnatal specimens demonstrates that the pattern of specific gene involvement is similar , whereas the classification spectrum of observed variants differs considerably.
