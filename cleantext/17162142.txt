  A low-protein diet ( LPD) is believed to be beneficial in slowing the progression of kidney disease. It is reported that low protein diet can improve protein , sugar and lipid metabolism , and reduce the symptoms and complications of renal insufficiency. However , there has been controversial regarding the effects of protein restriction on diabetic nephropathy ( DN). To investigate the efficacy of LPD on renal function in patients with type 1 or 2 DN by meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs). PubMed , MEDLINE , EMBASE and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched. Eleven randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria , of which 10 were English and 1 was Chinese. The primary outcome was a change in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR). The secondary outcome was a change in proteinuria<symptom>. Random-effects models were used to calculate the standardized mean difference ( SMD) and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CI). Subgroup analyses were also performed. Our research indicated that LPD was not associated with a significant improvement in GFR ( 1.59 ml Â· min The present research showed that LPD was not significantly associated with improvement of renal function in patients with either type 1 or 2 diabetic nephropathy. Although these results do not completely eliminate the possibility that LPD is beneficial for patients with diabetic nephropathy , it does not seem to be significant benefit to renal function.
