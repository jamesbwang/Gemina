  To describe the radiological phenotype of HER2-mutant lung cancers on CT at presentation. Eligible patients with lung adenocarcinomas with HER2 mutations were stage-matched with two control groups ( EGFR- and KRAS-mutant groups). Evaluated CT features of the primary tumor included size , location , consistency , contour , presence of pleural tags and pleural retractions. Presence of pleural effusions<symptom> , lung metastases , adenopathy<symptom> , chest wall invasion , and were also recorded. Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher 's exact tests were used to compare continuous and categorical features , respectively. One hundred and fifty-four patients were identified: 50 ( 33 %) harbored HER2 mutations , 56 ( 36 %) harbored KRAS mutations , and 48 ( 31 %) harbored EGFR mutations. Compared with KRAS , HER2 tumors presented as smaller lesions<symptom> ( 2.3 cm versus 2.9 cm , p = 0.005 for length; 1.6 cm versus 2.1 cm , p = 0.002 for width) with the presence of pleural tags ( 74 % vs. 52 % , p = 0.03) , pleural retractions ( 58 % vs. 39 % , p = 0.006) , ipsilateral hilar ( 36 % vs. 16 % , p = 0.03) and scalene/supraclavicular N3 adenopathy<symptom> ( 24 % vs. 7 % , p = 0.03). Compared with EGFR , pleural retractions were more prevalent among the HER2 tumors ( 58 % vs. 37 % , p = 0.05). Lung adenocarcinomas with HER2 gene mutation exhibit an aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom> manifesting by higher incidence of local invasion , compared to KRAS and EGFR mutant controls , and a nodal metastatic spread compared to KRAS-mutant control. This is the first radiogenomics study of HER2 mutations in lung cancer.
