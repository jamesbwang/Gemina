  Pancreatic cancer ( PC) is one of the most devastating human cancers , and despite the significant advances in the current therapeutic options , the overall survival rate for PC has remained static for the past 50 years. Plant-derived bioactive compounds play a vital role in cancer therapeutics by providing new lead compounds for future drug development. Therefore , the isolation , characterization , and identification of new bioactive compounds for the prevention and treatment of cancer continue to be an important aspect of natural product research. Many in vitro and in vivo studies published in the last few decades have established strong links between the phytochemical profile of eucalypts and anticancer activity. However , only a small number of these reports have attempted to demonstrate a relationship between the biological activity of eucalypt extracts and PC. This review focuses on potential anti-PC effects of an array of bioactive compounds present in various species of eucalypts. It also highlights the necessity for further in vitro and in vivo studies to develop a complete understanding of the potential this group of plants has for the development of potent and specific chemotherapeutic drugs for PC.
