  Forty-eight ( N = 48) African-Caribbeans participated in a church-based diabetes care survey in St. Thomas , U.S. Virgin Islands. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether integration was a significant predictor of depressive symptoms and glycemic control in persons with type 2 diabetes among African-Caribbeans in faith-based organizations ( FBO) , controlling for demographic variables. Data were collected on measures of integration of diabetes , acceptance , depressive symptoms , number of hypoglycemic episodes , hemoglobin Alc , and demographic characteristics. The majority of subjects were female. Acceptance and depression<symptom> were negatively correlated , and acceptance and integration were positively correlated. Depression<symptom> and number of mild hypoglycemic episodes were also positively correlated. Surprisingly , integration was not significantly related to hemoglobin Alc , number of hypoglycemic episodes , and depressive symptoms. Implications of these findings are presented.
