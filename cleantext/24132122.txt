  The complete genome sequence of classical swine fever<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( CSFV) strain CSFV-UP-BR-KHG-06 , from genotype 2.2 , was determined. Comparative analysis based on the amino acid sequence of some important B-cell epitopes , T-cell epitopes , glycosylation sites , and conformational residues showed the striking differences between the group 2 virus KHG-06 and the vaccine strains HCLV/India and C-strain.
