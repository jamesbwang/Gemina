  An efficient and targeted treatment for tumor cells is demonstrated. This targeting is based upon the strong affinity between hydroxyl-functional groups on graphene and acidic tumors. The hydroxylated graphene ( GOH) with a unique 2D architecture further improve the targeting capacity of the system via an enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR) process. Polyethylene glycol ( PEG) was employed for better biocompatibility and the antitumor drug doxorubicin ( DOX) was then incorporated. These additions created a biocompatible system with a superior pH-dependent drug release property. Its proficiency was due to its ability to pass through cell membranes<symptom> via a process of endocytosis and exocytosis. The results from a Transwell co-culture system discovered that the PEG-GOH-DOX system had a large impact on tumor cell viability ( less than 10 % survived after treatment) and little influence on normal cells ( more than 80 % survived). An in vitro 3D tumor model study demonstrated that the size of the PEG-GOH-DOX treated tumor was 50 % less than that of the pristine DOX treated tumor. In vivo data indicated that the PEG-GOH-DOX system was able to inhibit the size of tumors by a factor of 6.5 when compared to the untreated tumors.
