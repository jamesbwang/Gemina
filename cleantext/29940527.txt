  A decomposition model with an iterative solving framework is proposed for use in MeV dual energy computed tomography ( DECT). The decomposition model can deal with a broad range of materials and better matches the physics of MeV photons. The proposed iterative solving framework is based on the conventional projection-domain decomposition method , and verified by numerical experiments and experiments. It is shown that images reconstructed with the proposed method have less artifacts and provide more accurate estimates of the atomic number of materials than the conventional projection-domain decomposition method.
