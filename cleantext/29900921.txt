  This study investigated and compared the surface roughness achieved by glazing porcelain samples in a conventional and a microwave oven. Two commercial brands of metal ceramics were used , VITA VMK MASTER and IPS CLASSIC. Sixty samples were fabricated , 30 for each type of ceramic. The samples were sintered in the conventional oven and hand-polished to remove any irregularities. Samples ( n = 10) from each type of ceramic were further divided into three groups as follows: hand-polished ( Group A) , conventional oven glazed ( Group B) , and microwave glazed ( Group C). Each specimen was evaluated for surface roughness by atomic force microscope. Data were statistically analyzed using two-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA) and Tukey 's post hoc test ( a = 0.05). Two-way ANOVA indicated a highly significant difference in surface roughness based on the type of glazing ( P < 0.001) , there was a significant difference based on the metal ceramics ( P = 0.002). There was also a significant interaction between the type of glazing and metal ceramics ( P = 0.009). The images obtained from the atomic force microscope corroborated the measured values. All the results indicate that microwave glazing can be a feasible option for glazing porcelain specimens. It was concluded that surface topography is influenced by surface treatment and microwave glazed ceramic is superior to conventional oven glazed ceramic and hand-polishing showed greater surface roughness when compared to glazing. IPS CLASSIC ceramic showed relatively smooth surface when compared to VITA VMK MASTER irrespective of the surface treatment.
