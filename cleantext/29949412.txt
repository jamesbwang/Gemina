  Unenhanced MRI , indirect MR arthrography , direct MR arthrography , and CT arthrography are each currently used to evaluate patients with recurrent knee pain after meniscus surgery. The purpose of this study is to review the evidence for the use of these examinations in patients with suspected recurrent meniscus tear. Direct and indirect MR arthrography are superior to conventional MRI for the assessment of the postoperative meniscus after meniscus repair or partial meniscectomy involving more than 25 % of the meniscus.
