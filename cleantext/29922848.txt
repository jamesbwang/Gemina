  Head and neck cancer ( HNC) guidelines recommend regular multidisciplinary team ( MDT) monitoring and early intervention to optimize dysphagia<symptom> outcomes; however , many factors affect the ability to achieve these goals. The aims of this study were to explore the barriers/facilitators to establishing and sustaining a MDT HNC care pathway and to examine the dysphagia-related speech-language pathology ( SLP) and dietetic components of the pathway. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research ( CFIR) , a mixed methods study design was used to evaluate an established MDT HNC pathway. Ten MDT members provided perceptions of facilitators/barriers to implementing and sustaining the pathway. Patients attending the SLP and dietetic components of the pathway who commenced treatment between 2013 and 2014 ( n = 63) were audited for attendance , outcome data collected per visit , and swallowing outcomes to 24-month post-treatment. Dysphagia<symptom> outcomes were compared to a published cohort who had received intensive prophylactic dysphagia<symptom> management. Multiple CFIR constructs were identified as critical to implementing and sustaining the pathway. Complexity was a barrier. Patient attendance was excellent during treatment , with low rates of non-compliance ( < 15 %) to 24 months. Collection of clinician/patient outcome tools was good during treatment , but lower post-treatment. Dysphagia<symptom> outcomes were good and comparable to prior published data. The pathway provided patients with access to regular supportive care and provided staff opportunities to provide early and ongoing dysphagia<symptom> monitoring and management. However , implementing and sustaining a HNC pathway is complex , requiring significant staff resources , financial investment , and perseverance. Regular audits are necessary to monitor the quality of the pathway.
