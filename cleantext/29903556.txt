  In the last several decades , the need for 3D images in dentistry have developed. Computerized tomography was first introduced mainly with the advent of implantology , but its use remained limited to a small number of specialists , due to its indications , access and dose radiation. In the late 90 's , a new technology using a cone-shaped beam and a reciprocating detector , which rotates around the patient 360 degrees and acquires projected data in a single rotation , namely the cone beam computerized tomography ( CBCT) , invaded dentistry , making the perception of 3D easily acceptable to dentists and their patients.
