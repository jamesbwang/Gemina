  To evaluate the usual fruit intake of Chinese adults. A total of 12 379 adults aged 18 to 65 years old with both 3 days 24 hours dietary recall data and FFQ data were chosen from China Nutritional Transition Cohort Study ( 2015). The models of fruit consumption probability and amount for Chinese adults were fitted using the National Cancer Institute method ( referred to as NCI) , to evaluate the fruit usual intake of Chinese adults , and to describe the distribution of the consumption. According to 3 consecutive days of 24 hours dietary recall , the probability of consumption of fruit among Chinese adults was 40. 2 % , the median of cosumption was 0 ( 0 , 70. 0) g/d. The frequency of fruit consumption greater than or equal to once a day was17. 4 % in male , which was lower than that of 22. 9 % in female. According to the NCI method , the probability of fruit consumption among Chinese adults reached 98. 7 % , the fruit consumption probability in male was 98. 3 % , slightly lower than that of 99. 1 % in female; the median of average daily consumption of fruit was 6. 4 ( 3. 2 , 58. 3) g/d , it was4. 4 ( 2. 5 , 36. 7) g/d in male , 9. 0 ( 4. 1 , 78. 6) g/d in female. Through the NCI method , the rate of consumption of fruit among Chinese adults has been greatly improved. And the distribution of fruit consumption has been somewhat improved , but was still on the low level , far away from the lowest recommended intake. Some measures should be taken to guide reasonable fruit consumption behavior among Chinese residents. Meanwhile , by combining the FFQ method with dietary recall method , separating the nonconsumers from the un-consumers , and taking into account the correlation between fruit consumption probability and amount , NCI method can reevaluate the usual intake of fruits.
