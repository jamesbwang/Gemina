Workloads of competitive surfing: work-to-relief ratios , surf-break demands , and updated analysis. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-The study provides an in-depth descriptive and quantitative time-motion analysis of competitive surfing , using Global Positioning System ( GPS) units and video synchronization , which serves to extend upon the results of Farley , Harris , and Kilding ( Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research , 26 , 7 ( 2012)). In addition , comparisons between locations and surfers competing in the same heats were performed. Global Positioning System and video data were collected from 41 male competitive surfers ( 23.2 ± 6.1 years , 71 ± 10.3 kg , 177.2 ± 6.4 cm) participating in 3 professional domestic surfing events , with competitive heats of 20-minute duration. Fifty data sets were analyzed across the 3 competitions , with velocities and distances covered , proportion of time spent performing various surfing activities , and total work-to-relief ratio determined. Results revealed surfers paddled 44 % of the total time , followed by stationary periods ( 42 %). Surfers performed at a significantly ( p ≤ 0.05) higher work-to-relief ratio ( 1.7:1) at the Beach-break ( an exposed beach) compared with point-break 1 and 2 ( waves breaking around a rocky point). Point-breaks 1 and 2 had longer continuous durations of paddling , with significantly longer rides at point-break 1 over the Beach-break ( p ≤ 0.01) and point-break 2 ( p ≤ 0.01). The average maximal speed ( 24.8 km · h) from point-break 2 was significantly faster than point-break 1 ( p ≤ 0.01) and Beach-break ( p ≤ 0.05). This information should influence surfing drills and conditioning methods to prepare these athletes for the disparate demands , such as training for a point-break competition involving longer durations of continuous paddling and short , high-intensity workloads for a Beach-break.
