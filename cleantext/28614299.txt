  The precise regulation of fluid and energy homeostasis is essential for survival. It is well appreciated that ingestive behaviors are tightly regulated by both peripheral sensory inputs and central appetite<symptom> signals. With recent neurogenetic technologies , considerable progress has been made in our understanding of basic taste qualities , the molecular and/or cellular basis of taste sensing , and the central circuits for thirst and hunger. In this review , we first highlight the functional similarities and differences between mammalian and invertebrate taste processing. We then discuss how central thirst and hunger signals interact with peripheral sensory signals to regulate ingestive behaviors. We finally indicate some of the directions for future research.
