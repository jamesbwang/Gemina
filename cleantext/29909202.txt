  Lewy body disease ( LBD) is characterized by accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein in the central nervous system as eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions<disease> called Lewy bodies. According to their distribution pattern , it is classified into brainstem LBD , limbic LBD and diffuse neocortical LBD. It has been reported that α-synuclein affects various points in the MAPK cascade but its relationship with FGF receptors , which are the most upstream of the pathway , has not been previously investigated. We discovered that among the four FGFRs , FGFR3 showed neuronal upregulation in LBD brains histopathologically. Further examination using neuron-specific methylome analysis revealed that the gene body of FGFR3 was hypermethylated in LBD , suggesting its increased transcription. Altered methylation was not observed in the non-neuronal genome. Altered methylation status was associated with the severity of α-synuclein pathology.
