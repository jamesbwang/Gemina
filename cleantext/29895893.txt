  Peripheral blood C-reactive protein ( CRP) is a biomarker used clinically to measure systemic inflammation<symptom> and is reproducibly increased in a subset of patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD). Furthermore , increased peripheral blood CRP in MDD has been associated with altered reward circuitry and increased brain glutamate in relation with symptoms of anhedonia. Nevertheless , the relationship between peripheral CRP and other peripheral and central markers of inflammation<symptom> in depressed patients has not been established. Plasma ( n = 89) and CSF ( n = 73) was collected from medically stable , currently unmedicated adult outpatients with MDD. Associations among plasma and CSF CRP and plasma and CSF inflammatory cytokines ( interleukin ( IL) -6 , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF) and IL-1beta) and their soluble receptors/antagonists were examined. Relationships between plasma and CSF inflammatory markers and depressive symptoms including anhedonia and reduced motivation ( RM) were also explored. Plasma CRP was correlated with multiple plasma inflammatory markers ( all p < 0.05) , and a strong correlation was found between plasma and CSF CRP ( r = 0.855 , p < 0.001). CSF CRP in turn correlated with CSF cytokine receptors/antagonists ( all p < 0.05). Principal component analyses revealed clusters of CSF inflammatory markers that were associated with high plasma CRP ( > 3 mg/L) and correlated with depressive symptom severity. These findings were driven by CSF TNF , which correlated with RM ( r = 0.236 , p = 0.045) , and CSF IL-6 soluble receptor , which correlated with anhedonia ( r = 0.301 , p = 0.010) in the sample as a whole and particularly females. CRP appears to be a peripheral biomarker that reflects peripheral and central inflammation<symptom> and seems well-suited for guiding immunotherapies targeting TNF and IL-6 in patients with MDD.
