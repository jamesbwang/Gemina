  Resective surgery is effective in treating drug-resistant focal epilepsy , but it remains unclear whether improved diagnostics influence postsurgical outcomes. Here , we compared practice and outcomes over 2 periods 15 years apart. Sixteen European centers retrospectively identified 2 cohorts of children and adults who underwent epilepsy surgery in the period of 1997 to 1998 ( n = 562) or 2012 to 2013 ( n = 736). Data collected included patient ( sex , age) and disease ( duration , localization and diagnosis) characteristics , type of surgery , histopathology , Engel postsurgical outcome , and complications , as well as imaging and electrophysiologic tests performed for each case. Postsurgical outcome predictors were included in a multivariate logistic regression to assess the strength of date of surgery as an independent predictor. Over time , the number of operated cases per center increased from a median of 31 to 50 per 2-year period ( Improvements in European epilepsy surgery over time are modest but significant , including higher surgical volume , shorter disease duration , and improved postsurgical seizure<symptom> outcomes. Early referral for evaluation is required to continue on this encouraging trend.
