  Interrupted time series analysis ( ITSA) is a popular evaluation methodology in which a single treatment unit 's outcome is studied over time , and the intervention is expected to `` interrupt '' the level and/or trend of the outcome , subsequent to its introduction. The internal validity of this analysis is strengthened considerably if the treated unit is contrasted with a comparable control group. In this paper , we introduce a novel machine learning approach using optimal discriminant analysis ( ODA) to evaluate treatment effects in multiple-group ITSA. We evaluate the effect of California 's Proposition 99 ( passed in 1988) for reducing cigarette sales , by comparing California ( CA) to Montana ( MT)- the best matching control state not exposed to any smoking reduction initiatives. We contrast results from ODA to those of ITSA regression ( ITSAREG)- a commonly used approach for evaluating treatment effects in ITSA studies. Both approaches found CA and MT to be comparable on their preintervention time series , and both approaches equally found CA to have statistically lower cigarette sales in the post-intervention period ( P < 0.0001). The ODA model achieved very high effect strength of sensitivity ( a measure of classification accuracy) of 91.67 % , which remained high ( 75.00 %) after conducting leave-one-out analysis to assess generalizability. The ODA framework achieved results comparable to ITSAREG , bolstering confidence in the intervention effect. In addition , ODA confers several advantages over conventional approaches that may make it a better approach to use in multiple group ITSA studies: insensitivity to skewed data , model-free permutation tests to derive P values , identification of the threshold value which best discriminates intervention and control groups , a chance- and maximum-corrected index of classification accuracy , and cross-validation to assess generalizability.
