  Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors ( MPNSTs) constitute a group of soft tissue neoplasm with neuroectodermal origin. Most cases are small at presentation and only some have been described reaching giant dimensions. We report two cases that were diagnosed and treated as giant MPNST of the scalp. Both patients had extensive lesion<symptom> on the head with intracranial infiltration. Microsurgical resection was indicated and a vascularized free flap was used to cover the defect. During follow-up the tumors recurred and further surgical excision treatment by adjuvant radiation therapy was performed. MPNSTs of the scalp are rare neoplasm of the peripheral nervous system. They are aggressive<symptom> lesion<symptom> that can recur and their management requires a multimodality approach.
