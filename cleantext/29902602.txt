  Vessel wall imaging ( VWI) is emerging as a novel imaging tool for the management and risk stratification of patients with intracranial saccular aneurysms<disease>. Our objective was to compare the rates of wall enhancement in unstable ( ruptured , growing , or symptomatic) and stable aneurysms<disease> and assess the ability of VWI with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging to distinguish between these 2 entities. This study was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines , and eligible studies were identified through a comprehensive literature review. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the association between aneurysm<disease> wall enhancement and aneurysm<disease> instability with the use of a random effects model. The I
