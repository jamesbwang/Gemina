  Impaired cerebellar development is an important determinant of adverse motor and cognitive outcomes in very preterm ( VPT) infants. However , longitudinal MRI studies investigating cerebellar maturation from birth through childhood and associated neurodevelopmental outcomes are lacking. We aimed to compare cerebellar volume and growth from term-equivalent age ( TEA) to 7 years between VPT ( < 30 weeks ' gestation or < 1250 g) and full-term children; and to assess the association between these measures , perinatal factors , and 7-year outcomes in VPT children , and whether these relationships varied by sex. In a prospective cohort study of 224 VPT and 46 full-term infants , cerebellar volumes were measured on MRI at TEA and 7 years. Useable data at either time-point were collected for 207 VPT and 43 full-term children. Cerebellar growth from TEA to 7 years was compared between VPT and full-term children. Associations with perinatal factors and 7-year outcomes were investigated in VPT children. VPT children had smaller TEA and 7-year volumes and reduced growth. Perinatal factors were associated with smaller cerebellar volume and growth between TEA and 7 years , namely , postnatal corticosteroids for TEA volume , and female sex , earlier birth gestation , white and deep nuclear gray matter injury for 7-year volume and growth. Smaller TEA and 7-year volumes , and reduced growth were associated with poorer 7-year IQ , language , and motor function , with differential relationships observed for male and female children. Our findings indicate that cerebellar growth from TEA to 7 years is impaired in VPT children and relates to early perinatal factors and 7-year outcomes.
