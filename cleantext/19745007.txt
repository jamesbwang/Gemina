  A herbal formula , Galgeun-tang-ga-cheongung-sinyi ( GGTCS) , is traditionally used for the treatment of rhinosinusitis in East Asian countries. However , there is a dearth of clinical evidence supporting the effects of this medication. Here , we describe the protocol for a randomized controlled study designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of GGTCS for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS). To investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of GGTCS for the treatment of CRS , a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , clinical trial has been designed. A total of 58 participants with CRS will be recruited and randomly allocated to a GGTCS or placebo group in a 1:1 ratio. The participants will be administered GGTCS or placebo granules 3 times a day for 8 weeks. Data will be collected from the participants at baseline and at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 weeks after random allocation. The primary outcome measure will be the mean change in the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 score from baseline to 8 weeks. The secondary outcomes will include the Total Nasal Symptom Score , EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Levels score , Nasal Endoscopy Index , Lund-Mackay score , and total serum immunoglobulin E level. The key elements for conducting a high-quality randomized clinical trial have been addressed in this protocol. In summary , the findings of this study are expected to provide a base for large-scale randomized controlled trials to confirm the safety and efficacy of GGTCS for the treatment of CRS and may consequently serve to improve future treatment strategies for this condition. This study has been registered at the Korean National Clinical Trial Registry , Clinical Research Information Service ( KCT0002835).
