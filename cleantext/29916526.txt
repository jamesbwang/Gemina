  Autophagy is crucial in cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in the development of malignant tumors. However , the regulatory function of autophagy in cancer remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study , the autophagy-mediated competing endogenous RNA ( ceRNA) ceRNA interaction networks in colorectal cancer ( CRC) were constructed by integrating systematically expression profiles of long nonâ€‘coding RNAs and mRNAs. It was found that a large proportion of autophagy genes were inclined to target hub nodes , including a fraction of autophagy genes , by comparing with other genes within ceRNA networks , and showed preferential interaction with themselves. The present study also revealed that autophagy genes may be used as prognostic markers for cancer therapy. A risk score model based on multivariable Cox regression analysis was then used to capture novel biomarkers in connection with lncRNA for the prognosis of CRC. These biomarkers were confirmed in the test dataset and an additional independent dataset. Furthermore , the prognostic value of biomarkers is independent of conventional clinical factors. These results provide improved understanding of autophagy-mediated ceRNA regulatory mechanisms in CRC and provide novel potential molecular therapeutic targets for the diagnosis and treatment of CRC.
