  Ribosome-inactivating proteins ( RIPs) are potent toxins that inactivate ribosomes by catalytically removing a specific adenine from the & alpha;- sarcin/ricin loop ( SRL) of the large rRNA. Direct assays for measuring depurination activity and indirect assays for measuring the resulting translation inhibition have been employed to determine the enzyme activity of RIPs. Rapid and sensitive methods to measure the depurination activity of RIPs are critical for assessing their reaction mechanism , enzymatic properties , interaction with ribosomal proteins , ribotoxic stress signaling , in the search for inhibitors and in the detection and diagnosis of enteric<disease> infections<disease>. Here , we review the major assays developed for measuring the catalytic activity of RIPs , discuss their advantages and disadvantages and explain how they are used in understanding the catalytic mechanism , ribosome specificity , and dynamic enzymatic features of RIPs.
