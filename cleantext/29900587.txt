  To investigate prognostic value of varices on computed tomography ( CT) and redefine surrogate criteria for clinically significant portal hypertension ( CSPH). We retrospectively enrolled 241 patients with compensated cirrhosis who underwent hepatic venous pressure gradient ( HVPG) measurement from 2008 to 2013. Using CT and upper endoscopy findings obtained within 3 months from HVPG measurement , patients were classified into three groups: presence of standard surrogate for CSPH , defined as presence of varices on upper endoscopy and/or splenomegaly<symptom> associated with thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( Group 1 , n = 139); varices on CT without standard surrogate for CSPH ( Group 2 , n = 41); and free from both ( Group 3 , n = 61). HVPG value and overall survival ( OS) rates were compared among three patient groups. Revised surrogate for CSPH was defined as presence of standard surrogate and/or presence of varices on CT ( i.e. both Group 1 and Group 2). Mean HVPG value in Group 2 was significantly higher than that in Group 3 ( 10.3 mmHg vs 6.5 mmHg , P < 0.001) , but significantly lower than that in Group 1 ( 10.3 mmHg vs 13.1 mmHg , P < 0.001). Seven-year OS rates in Group 2 was similar to those in Group 1 ( 57.0 % vs 62.7 % , P = 0.591) , but significantly poorer than those in Group 3 ( 57.0 % vs 84.0 % , P = 0.015). The presence of revised surrogate for CSPH was a significant predictive factor for OS ( P = 0.025 , Hazard ratio = 2.71 ( 1.14-6.45)) on multivariate analysis whereas standard surrogate for CSPH was not ( P = 0.849). The presence of varices on CT was a significant sign for CSPH , predicting poor OS outcome in patients with compensated cirrhosis.
