  The dendritic growth of Li metal leads to electrode degradation and safety concerns , impeding its application in building high energy density batteries. Forming a protective layer on the Li surface that is electron-insulating , ion-conducting , and maintains an intimate interface is critical. We herein demonstrate that Li plating is stabilized by a biphasic surface layer composed of a lithium-indium alloy and a lithium halide , formed in situ by the reaction of an electrolyte additive with Li metal. This stabilization is attributed to the fast lithium migration though the alloy bulk and lithium halide surface , which is enabled by the electric field across the layer that is established owing to the electron-insulating halide phase. A greatly stabilized Li-electrolyte interface and dendrite-free plating over 400 hours in Li | Li symmetric cells using an alkyl carbonate electrolyte is demonstrated. High energy efficiency operation of the Li
