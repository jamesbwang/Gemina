  Permeabilization of the plasma membrane represents an important threat for any cell , since it compromises its viability by disrupting cell homeostasis. Numerous pathogenic bacteria produce pore-forming toxins that break plasma membrane integrity and cause cell death by colloid-osmotic lysis. Eukaryotic cells , in turn , have developed different ways to cope with the effects of such membrane piercing. Here , we provide a short overview of the general mechanisms currently proposed for plasma membrane repair , focusing more specifically on the cellular responses to membrane permeabilization by pore-forming toxins and presenting new data on the effects and cellular responses to the permeabilization by an RTX ( repeats in toxin) toxin , the adenylate cyclase toxin-hemolysin secreted by the whooping
