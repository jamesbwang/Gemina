  The pathogenesis , clinical course , and response to treatment in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis<disease> ( SJIA) differ from other types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis<disease> and are similar to other interleukin-1 ( IL-1)- mediated diseases. The main cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of SJIA is IL-1Î² , which can be neutralized by targeted anti-IL-1 therapy. In SJIA , no antibodies have been found and there is growing evidence that it is mainly an autoinflammatory and not an autoimmune disease. Before the era of biologic therapy , treatment of SJIA was primarily based on long-term treatment with high doses of glucocorticosteroids ( GCS). The side effects of GCS could have a significant impact on the outcome of the disease and could cause long-term damage. Treatment with anti-IL-1 agents early in the disease course has revolutionized the management principles of SJIA. However , not all SJIA patients respond equally well to anti-IL-1 therapy , and it has been shown that age at the onset of disease , duration of the disease , number of affected joints , neutrophil count , and ferritin level can predict the response to anti-IL-1 therapy. In particular , an elevated ferritin level should prompt testing for macrophage activation syndrome<disease> ( MAS) , the most severe complication of SJIA. Anti-IL-1 therapy has been shown to be effective also in patients with MAS. Although anti-IL-1 agents are currently not recommended as first-line treatment , there is growing evidence that anti-IL-1 agents introduced at the beginning of SJIA could enable lower doses and a shorter duration of GCS therapy , change the long-term disease outcome , and even influence molecular disease patterns. There are currently three anti-IL-1 agents available: anakinra , canakinumab , and rilonacept. In this review , we present the current knowledge on the pathogenesis of SJIA , the rational for anti-IL-1 treatment , and future perspectives on the treatment of SJIA.
