  The PREDIMED ( PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) is a multicentre trial analyzed as a prospective cohort study. A total of 7122 participants ( aged 55-80 years) at high risk of cardiovascular disease in the PREDIMED trial were recruited in 11 centres in Spain. The prevalence of subjects with type 2 diabetes was 50 %. Our objective was to determine the contribution of lifestyle factors to the development of peripheral artery disease ( PAD). Incident clinical PAD in relation to a healthy lifestyle 5-point score defined as adherence to a Mediterranean diet ( MedDiet) , moderate alcohol intake , regular physical activity , normal weight ( BMI < 25) and non-smoking was measured. Eighty-seven incident PAD cases were diagnosed during a median follow-up of 4.8 years. Compared with participants with 0 or 1 healthy lifestyle factor , the multivariable hazard ratio for PAD was 0.65 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.37 to 1.14) for 2 factors , and 0.40 ( 0.22-0.72) for 3 or more. Moderate alcohol consumption , non-smoking , physical activity and following a MedDiet were significantly inversely associated with PAD whereas no association was found for normal weight ( BMI < 25 kg/m Our results demonstrate that a simple healthy lifestyle score is associated with a substantially reduced risk of PAD in a high cardiovascular risk population with a high prevalence ( 50 %) of subjects with type 2 diabetes.
