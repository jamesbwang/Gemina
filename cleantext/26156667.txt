  Balloon pulmonary angioplasty ( BPA) is a treatment option for patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH). In 60 patients with CTEPH , we examined the hemodynamic data before and after BPA. In addition , the sequential ECG findings for right ventricular hypertrophy ( RVH) were assessed. The mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( mPAP) decreased from 38 ± 11 to 20 ± 4 mm Hg ( p < 0.05). The ROC analysis showed that the S waves in V5 , R waves in V1 + S waves in V5 , S waves in I , and QRS axis were significant predictors of an mPAP ≧ 30 mm Hg ( AUC > 0.75 , p < 0.01). The predictive values for the mPAP before the BPA were the S and R waves in lead V6 , and P waves in lead II ( 33.417 + 0.078 × P in II- 0.10 × R in V6 + 0.012 × S in V6). The change in the mPAP ( ΔmPAP) correlated with the change in the amplitudes of the ECGs: ΔS wave in lead I ( R = 0.544 , p < 0.001) , ΔR in V1 + S in V5 ( R = 0.476 , p < 0.001) , and ΔP wave in II ( R = 0.511 , p < 0.001). At 6 months of follow-up , the improvement in an R in V1 + S in V5 of ≧ 10 mm implied a better functional status. BPA therapy reduced the pulmonary arterial pressure in patients with CTEPH and was associated with an improvement in the ECG findings related to RVH.
