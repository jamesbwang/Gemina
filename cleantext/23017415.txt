  In this study , the effects of different pulverizing methods on the chemical attributes and thermal properties of black , white and green pepper were evaluated. Cryogenic grinding minimally damaged the lipid , moisture , crude protein , starch , non-volatile ether extract , piperine , essential oil and the typical pepper essential oil compounds of the spices. The pulverizing methods and storage significantly affected the compositions of the fatty acid in the peppers , except for palmitic acid and lignoceric acid. The amino acid contents and the thermo-gravimetric analysis curve were hardly influenced by the grinding techniques. The use of cryogenic grinding to prepare pepper ensured the highest quality of pepper products. Regardless of grinding technique , the values of moisture , piperine , unsaturated fatty acids , essential oil , monoterpenes , and the absolute concentrations of typical pepper essential oil constituents ( except caryophyllene oxide) decreased , whereas the amino acid , lipid , protein , starch , and non-volatile ether extract content as well as the thermal properties were insignificantly changed after storage at 4 Â°C for 6 months.
