  Aortic valve stenosis ( AVS) is the most common valvular heart disease in the Western world. Therapy based on apolipoprotein A-I ( apoA-I) , the major protein component of high-density lipoproteins , results in AVS regression in experimental models. Nevertheless , apoA-I degradation by proteases might lead to suboptimal efficacy of such therapy. An activatable probe using a quenched fluorescently labeled full-length apoA-I protein was generated to assess apoA-I-degrading protease activity in plasma derived from 44 men and 20 women with severe AVS ( age 65.0 ± 10.4 years) as well as from a rabbit model of AVS. In human and rabbit AVS plasma , apoA-I-degrading protease activity was significantly higher than in controls ( humans: 0.038 ± 0.009 vs 0.022 ± 0.005 RFU/s , p < 0.0001; rabbits: 0.033 ± 0.016 vs 0.017 ± 0.005 RFU/s , p = 0.041). Through the use of protease inhibitors , we identified metalloproteinases ( MMP) as exerting the most potent proteolytic effect on apoA-I in AVS rabbits ( 67 % , p < 0.05 vs control) , while the cysteine protease cathepsin S accounted for 54.2 % of apoA-I degradation in human plasma ( p < 0.05 vs control) with the maximum effect seen in women ( 68.8 % , p < 0.05 vs men). Accordingly , cathepsin S activity correlated significantly with mean transaortic pressure gradient in women ( r = 0.5 , p = 0.04) but not in men ( r =- 0.09 , p = 0.60) , and was a significant independent predictor of disease severity in women ( standardized beta coefficient 0.832 , p < 0.001) when tested in a linear regression analysis. ApoA-I proteolysis is increased in AVS. Targeting circulating cathepsin S may lead to new therapies for human aortic valve disease.
