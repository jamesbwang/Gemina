  As an important way to help express the preference relation between alternatives , distributed preference relation ( DPR) can represent the preferred , non-preferred , indifferent , and uncertain degrees of one alternative over another simultaneously. DPR , however , is unavailable in some situations where a decision maker can not provide the precise degrees of one alternative over another due to lack of knowledge , experience , and data. In this paper , to address this issue , we propose interval-valued DPR ( IDPR) and present its properties of validity and normalization. Through constructing two optimization models , an IDPR matrix is transformed into a score matrix to facilitate the comparison between any two alternatives. The properties of the score matrix are analyzed. To guarantee the rationality of the comparisons between alternatives derived from the score matrix , the additive consistency of the score matrix is developed. In terms of these , IDPR is applied to model and solve multiple criteria group decision making ( MCGDM) problem. Particularly , the relationship between the parameters for the consistency of the score matrix associated with each decision maker and those for the consistency of the score matrix associated with the group of decision makers is analyzed. A manager selection problem is investigated to demonstrate the application of IDPRs to MCGDM problems.
