  Curcumin ( diferuloylmethane) is a natural bioactive compound with many health-promoting benefits. However , its poor water solubility and bioavailability has limited curcumin & rsquo; s biomedical application. In the present study , we encapsulated curcumin into liposomes , formed from natural sources ( salmon lecithin) , and characterized its encapsulation efficiency and release profile. The proposed natural carriers increased the solubility and the bioavailability of curcumin. In addition , various physico-chemical properties of the developed soft nanocarriers with and without curcumin were studied. Nanoliposome-encapsulated curcumin increased the viability and network formation in the culture of primary cortical neurons and decreased the rate of apoptosis.
