  To assess the relationship between rapidly destructive osteoarthritis ( RDOA) of the hip and intra-articular steroid injections. Coding records from 2000 to 2013 were used to identify all subjects who had a fluoroscopy-guided intra-articular hip injection to treat pain associated with primary osteoarthritis. Radiographic measurements from preinjection and postinjection imaging were evaluated with Luquesne 's classification of RDOA to determine diagnosis ( greater than 50 % joint space narrowing or greater than 2 mm of cartilage loss in 1 year with no other forms of destructive arthropathy). Demographic information , health characteristics , and number of injections were collected and analyzed as other potential explanatory variables. Patient outcome assessed by need for total hip arthroplasty ( THA) after injection was also recorded. One hundred twenty-nine injection events met the inclusion criteria in a total of 109 patients. From this sample , 23 cases of RDOA were confirmed representing a 21 % incidence of RDOA. Twenty-one of the patients ( 91 %) with RDOA had a THA at a median time of 10.2 months ( interquartile range: 6.5-11.2) compared with 27 ( 31 %) of those without RDOA at a median time of 24.9 months ( interquartile range: 15.3-65.3). Older patients , patients with more severe osteoarthritis , and patients who identified themselves as white were more likely to have a diagnosis of RDOA ( The potential for RDOA and faster progression to THA raises questions about the use of intra-articular steroid injections for hip osteoarthritis and should be discussed with patients. Additional studies are needed to define a true relationship.
