  The clinical use of left ventricular assist devices ( LVADs) in the growing epidemic of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> has improved quality of life and long-term survival for this otherwise devastating disease. The current generation of commercially available devices offers a smaller profile that simplifies surgical implantation , a design that optimizes blood flow characteristics , with less adverse events and improved durability than their predecessors. Despite this , the risk for adverse events remains significant , as do burdens for patients and their caregivers. Appropriate patient selection remains key to optimal LVAD outcomes.
