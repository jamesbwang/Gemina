  Isoniazid ( INH)- induced peripheral neuritis is not uncommonly reported in adults , especially those with malnutrition and alcoholism , but it is very rare in children. INH leads to peripheral neuritis by causing a deficiency in the serum level of pyridoxine which depends on the dose of INH , duration of treatment and the patient 's nutritional and acetylator status. A 12-year-old girl developed tingling and numbness of the lower limbs after commencing anti-tuberculous therapy which included INH 10 mg/kg/day. The symptoms continued despite the dose being reduced to 5 mg/kg/day. Nerve conduction velocity was normal. Her diet was poor: she consumed little or no fruit and vegetables and ate mostly dal and rice. Discontinuation of INH was advised and her therapy was changed to ofloxacin , rifampicin , ethambutol and pyrazinamide along with a high dose of pyridoxine and multi-vitamins. The tingling and numbness subsided within 15 days , after which INH was prescribed at the dose of 10 mg/kg/day. Although INH-induced neuropathy is rare in children , the World Health Organization recommends pyridoxine prophylaxis for children on INH who are malnourished or have HIV<pathogen> infection.
