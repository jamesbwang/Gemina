  The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between the dietary approaches to stop hypertension ( DASH) and metabolic syndrome<disease> in postmenopausal Korean women without diabetes. Our study enrolled postmenopaual women without diabetes ( n = 6826). We used the DASH-Korean quartile ( KQ) model using six nutrients. For protein , fiber , calcium , and potassium , we scored 1 for the first quartile ( 1Q) , 2 for the second quartile ( 2Q) , 3 for the third quartile ( 3Q) , and 4 for the fourth quartile ( 4Q). For fat and sodium , we scored 4 for the 1Q , 3 for the 2Q , 2 for the 3Q , and 1 for the 4Q. We defined the sum of the six scores as the DASH-KQ score. Participants were divided into four quartiles ( DASH-1Q , DASH-2Q , DASH-3Q , and DASH-4Q) , according to the sum of the six DASH-KQ scores. The number of participants with metabolic syndrome<disease> in DASH-1Q , DASH-2Q , DASH-3Q , or DASH-4Q was 601 ( 37.4 %) , 671 ( 31.1 %) , 440 ( 30.5 %) , and 492 ( 30.3 %) , respectively. The proportion of participants with metabolic syndrome<disease> was greatest in DASH-1Q ( P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that every increase in the DASH-KQ score by 1 exhibited a 0.977-fold odds for metabolic syndrome<disease>. DASH-1Q , by DASH-KQ score , had higher odds for metabolic syndrome<disease> than the other groups. The lowest quartile of the DASH-KQ score was associated with a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome<disease> in postmenopausal Korean women without diabetes.
