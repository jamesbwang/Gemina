  Because of the increase in the number of immunocompromised patients , the incidence of invasive fungal infections is growing , but the treatment efficiency remains unacceptably low. The most potent clinical systemic antifungals ( azoles) are the derivatives of two scaffolds: ketoconazole and fluconazole. Being the safest antifungal drugs , they still have shortcomings , mainly because of pharmacokinetics and resistance. Here , we report the successful use of the target fungal enzyme , sterol 14Î±-demethylase ( CYP51) , for structure-based design of novel antifungal drug candidates by minor modifications of VNI ( ( R)- N- ( 1- ( 2,4-dichlorophenyl) -2- ( 1 H-imidazol-1-yl) ethyl) -4- ( 5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl) benzamide)) , an inhibitor of protozoan CYP51 that cures Chagas disease. The synthesis of fungi-oriented VNI derivatives , analysis of their potencies to inhibit CYP51s from two major fungal pathogens ( Aspergillus<pathogen> fumigatus<pathogen> and Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> , microsomal stability , effects in fungal cells , and structural characterization of A.<pathogen> fumigatus<pathogen> CYP51 in complexes with the most potent compound are described , offering a new antifungal drug scaffold and outlining directions for its further optimization.
