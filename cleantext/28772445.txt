  The present contribution deals with the experimental investigation of the time-dependent behavior of a typical overlay concrete subjected to tensile stresses. The latter develop in concrete overlays , which are placed on existing concrete structures as a strengthening measure , due to the shrinkage of the young overlay concrete , which is restrained by the substrate concrete. Since the tensile stresses are reduced by creep , creep in tension is investigated on sealed and unsealed specimens , loaded at different concrete ages. The creep tests as well as the companion shrinkage tests are performed in a climatic chamber at constant temperature and constant relative humidity. Since shrinkage depends on the change of moisture content , the evolution of the mass water content is determined at the center of each specimen by means of an electrolytic resistivity-based system. Together with the experimental results for compressive creep from a previous study , a consistent set of time-dependent material data , determined for the same composition of the concrete mixture and on identical specimens , is now available. It consists of the hygral and mechanical properties , creep and shrinkage strains for both sealed and drying conditions , the respective compliance functions , and the mass water contents in sealed and unsealed , loaded and load-free specimens.
