  While many studies have examined environmental risk factors for autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) , much of the research focus has been on prenatal or perinatal factors. Yet , the postnatal environment may affect the risk of ASD as well. To determine whether a set of five postnatal variables are associated with ASD. These variables are: acetaminophen exposure , antibiotic exposure , incidence of ear<disease> infection<disease> , decreased duration of breastfeeding , and decreased consumption of oral vitamin D drops. An Internet-based survey was conducted. Participants were parents living in the USA with at least one biological child between 3 and 12 years of age. Potential participants were informed about the survey via postings on social media , websites , and listservs and were offered an opportunity to participate in a raffle as well. Participants were also recruited through the Interactive Autism Network. There were 1,741 completed survey responses. After exclusions , there remained 1,001 responses associated with children with ASD ( cases) and 514 responses associated with children who do not have ASD ( controls). In this data set , doses of postnatal acetaminophen ( adjusted odds ratio ( aOR) 1.016 , CI: 1.003-1.032 , This study adds to evidence that postnatal acetaminophen use , postnatal antibiotic use , incidence of ear<disease> infection<disease> , and early weaning are associated with an increased risk of ASD. It also finds that postnatal oral vitamin D drops are weakly associated with ASD when adjusted for breastfeeding and demographics.
