  Salivary cortisol assay , described for the first time almost forty years ago , has not been expanding until the last decade. Its simplicity , non-invasiveness and the easy repetition of sampling make it an analytical matrix of interest. Since the publication of the recommendations of the American endocrinology society in 2008 , salivary cortisol is recognized as one of the three main tests to screen for Cushing 's syndrome<disease>. In addition , salivary cortisone , the major metabolite of salivary cortisol , still represents a severe potential interferent but could also be a complementary analyte for indications where evaluation of cortisol secretion is sought. Moreover , in the current context of practices and methods harmonization , the problem of lack of standardization presents also for salivary cortisol. This review briefly develops the three main tests of Cushing 's syndrome<disease> screening to explain the reasons for integrating the saliva test into this screening. Then we will develop the variables that can influence salivary cortisol from a pre-analytic , physiopathological and finally analytical point of view.
