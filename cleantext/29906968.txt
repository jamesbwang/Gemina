  In this paper , we investigate the coupled Sasa-Satsuma equations , which describe the simultaneous propagation of two ultrashort pulses in the birefringent or two-mode fiber with the third-order dispersion , self-steepening , and stimulated Raman scattering effects. Darboux-dressing transformation is applied to obtain the dark-bright soliton and semirational rogue-wave solutions. Dark-bright one solitons with the single-hump , double-hump , and even breather-like structures are presented. Interactions between the double-peak breather and different kinds of dark-bright solitons are studied. We show that the double-peak ( or single-peak) rogue wave can coexist and interact with different kinds of dark-bright solitons. Coexistence of the solitons with different velocities and rogue waves is also found. Numerical stabilities of the dark-bright solitons and semirational rogue waves are exhibited. It is expected that those localized wave phenomena can be experimentally observed and have potential applications.
