  Numerous studies have established the effectiveness of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB) for weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and co-morbidity amelioration. However , its safety and efficacy in elderly patients remains controversial. To evaluate outcomes in patients aged ≥ 60 years who underwent RYGB compared with nonsurgical controls with the hypothesis that RYGB provides weight<symptom> loss<symptom> benefits without differences in survival. University-affiliated tertiary center. All patients who underwent RYGB from 1985 to 2015 were identified and divided into elderly ( age ≥ 60) and nonelderly ( age < 60) groups. A nonsurgical elderly control population was identified using a clinical data repository of outpatient visits to propensity match elderly patients 4:1 on demographic characteristics , co-morbidities , and relevant preoperative substance/medication use. Unpaired appropriate univariate analyses compared each stratified group. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were fitted based on social security death data. A total of 2306 patients underwent RYGB. The 107 elderly patients had lower median body mass index ( 47.0 versus 49.9; P = .007) and higher rates of co-morbidities. Rates of complications did not differ between elderly and nonelderly patients. Elderly surgical patients were propensity matched 4:1 ( 10,044 controls) yielding 428 well-matched nonsurgical controls. The elderly group demonstrated significant percent reduction in excess<symptom> body mass index compared with the control group ( 81.8 % versus 10.3 %; P < .001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank test demonstrated no difference in midterm survival ( P = .63). A significant weight reduction benefit was identified after RYGB in elderly patients without a difference in midterm survival compared with propensity-matched controls , suggesting RYGB is a safe and efficacious weight<symptom> loss<symptom> strategy in the elderly.
