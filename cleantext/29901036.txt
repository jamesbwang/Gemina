  We report the first diarylborane-catalysed hydrosilylation of epoxides and cyclic ethers. Mechanistic studies on the in situ generated Piers ' borane ( C6F5) 2BH with hydrosilanes in the presence of an epoxide revealed that an alkyloxy ( diaryl) borane ( C6F5) 2BOR is readily formed as a catalytically competent species for the outer-sphere hydrosilylation of epoxides and cyclic ethers.
