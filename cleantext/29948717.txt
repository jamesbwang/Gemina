  In this study , we investigated the effects of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> ( AMF) Funneliformis mosseae and Diversispora spurcum on the growth , antioxidant physiology , and uptake of phosphorus ( P) , sulfur ( S) , lead ( Pb) , zinc ( Zn) , cadmium ( Cd) , and arsenic ( As) by maize ( Zea mays L.) grown in heavy metal-polluted soils though a potted plant experiment. F. mosseae significantly increased the plant chlorophyll a content , height , and biomass; decreased the H
