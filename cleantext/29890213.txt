  Mood disorders are chronic , recurrent mental diseases that affect millions of individuals worldwide. Although over the past 40 years the biogenic amine models have provided meaningful links with the clinical phenomena of , and the pharmacological treatments currently employed in , mood disorders , there is still a need to examine the contribution of other systems to the neurobiology and treatment of mood disorders. This article reviews the current literature describing the potential role of nitric oxide ( NO) signaling in the pathophysiology and thereby the treatment of mood disorders. The hypothesis has arisen from several observations including ( i) altered NO levels in patients with mood disorders; ( ii) antidepressant effects of NO signaling blockers in both clinical and pre-clinical studies; ( iii) interaction between conventional antidepressants/mood stabilizers and NO signaling modulators in several biochemical and behavioral studies; ( iv) biochemical and physiological evidence of interaction between monoaminergic ( serotonin , noradrenaline , and dopamine) system and NO signaling; ( v) interaction between neurotrophic factors and NO signaling in mood regulation and neuroprotection; and finally ( vi) a crucial role for NO signaling in the inflammatory processes involved in pathophysiology of mood disorders. These accumulating lines of evidence have provided a new insight into novel approaches for the treatment of mood disorders.
