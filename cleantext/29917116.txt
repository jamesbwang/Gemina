  Pediatric supratentorial ependymomas ( SEs) have distinct molecular and behavioral differences from their infratentorial counterparts. To present our experience with pediatric SEs over a 24-yr period. Clinical , operative , and radiographic information was abstracted retrospectively. Our primary outcomes were progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS). Detection of C11orf95-RELA rearrangement was performed using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization ( iFISH). Seventy-three patients were identified ( 41 female , 32 male); median age was 6.7 yrs ( range , 1 mo-18.8 yr); median follow-up was 8.3 yrs ( range , 2.0-26.3). Fifty-eight ( 79.5 %) of 73 patients underwent gross total resection ( GTR); no patient with subtotal resection had greater than 1 cm3 of residual tumor; 42 patients ( 57.5 %) experienced subsequent disease progression with 17 patients ultimately dying of their disease. Median PFS was 3.7 yrs. Molecular analysis was available for 51 patients ( 70 %). On bivariate analysis , PFS and OS were not statistically affected by age , tumor grade , or extent of resection , although there was a clinically significant trend for the latter in favor of aggressive resection on PFS ( P = .061). Children with RELA fusion had significantly higher PFS ( P = .013) than those without , although there was no difference in OS when compared with those with no C11orf95-RELA fusion or C11orf95 gene rearrangement alone. In our series , GTR may be associated with better PFS , but did not impact OS. Surprisingly , RELA fusion was not found to be a negative prognostic factor , raising the possibility that the deleterious effects may be overcome by aggressive resection.
