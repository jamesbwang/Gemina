  The Machine Recognition of Crystallization Outcomes ( MARCO) initiative has assembled roughly half a million annotated images of macromolecular crystallization experiments from various sources and setups. Here , state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms are trained and tested on different parts of this data set. We find that more than 94 % of the test images can be correctly labeled , irrespective of their experimental origin. Because crystal recognition is key to high-density screening and the systematic analysis of crystallization experiments , this approach opens the door to both industrial and fundamental research applications.
