  This study aimed to explore the effects of ticagrelor ( a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor) on interleukin ( IL) -17 and myeloperoxidase ( MPO) expression in coronary thrombus as well as on the coronary blood flow in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) patients following percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). Forty STEMI patients who were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University between August 1 , 2014 and December 30 , 2014 were enrolled in this study according to a set inclusion criteria. They were randomized to ticagrelor and clopidogrel groups and treated with 180 mg ticagrelor and 600 mg clopidogrel before PCI , respectively. Intracoronary thrombus aspiration was performed by a physician during PCI. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were carried out to detect the expression of IL-17 and MPO in the thrombus. Corrected thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count ( CTFC) was used to evaluate blood flow after PCI. Immunohistochemistry results showed that the average positive staining area percentage of IL-17 and MPO in the clopidogrel group was significantly higher than that in the ticagrelor group. Western blot analysis also showed similar results for IL-17 ( clopidogrel 0.71 ± 0.036 , ticagrelor 0.50 ± 0.56) and MPO ( clopidogrel 0.50 ± 0.040; ticagrelor 0.38 ± 0.06). CTFC was lower in the ticagrelor group than that in the clopidogrel group ( P < 0.05). Ticagrelor is more effective than clopidogrel in reducing inflammation<symptom> thrombosis and improving postprocedural PCI blood flow in STEMI patients.
