  We aimed to develop and validate a prognostic score for disability at discharge and functional outcome at three months in patients with acute ischemic stroke based on clinical information available on admission. The Dutch Stroke Score ( DSS) was developed in 1227 patients with ischemic stroke included in the Paracetamol ( Acetaminophen) In Stroke study. Predictors for Barthel Index ( BI) at discharge ( ` DSS-discharge ') and modified Rankin Scale ( mRS) at three months ( ` DSS-3 months ') were identified in multivariable ordinal regression. The models were internally validated with bootstrapping techniques. The DSS-3 months was externally validated in the PRomoting ACute Thrombolysis in Ischemic StrokE study ( 1589 patients) and the Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study ( 2107 patients). Model performance was assessed in terms of discrimination , expressed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC) , and calibration. At model development , the strongest predictors of Barthel Index at discharge were age per decade over 60 ( odds ratio = 1.55 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.41-1.68) , National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ( odds ratio = 1.24 per point , 95 % CI 1.22-1.26) and diabetes ( odds ratio = 1.62 , 95 % CI 1.32-1.91). The internally validated AUC was 0.76 ( 95 % CI 0.75-0.79). The DSS-3 months , additionally consisting of previous stroke and atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> , performed similarly at internal ( AUC 0.75 , 95 % CI 0.74-0.77) and external validation ( AUC 0.74 in PRomoting ACute Thrombolysis in Ischemic StrokE ( 95 % CI 0.72-0.76) and 0.69 in Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study ( 95 % CI 0.69-0.72)). Observed outcome was slightly better than predicted. If further validated , the DSS may contribute to efficient stroke unit discharge planning alongside patients ' contextual factors and therapeutic needs.
