  Several characteristics of the ventricular fibrillation ( VF) waveform during cardiac arrest are associated with defibrillation success , including peak amplitude in the seconds prior to defibrillation. It is not known if immediate pre-defibrillation amplitude is associated with successful defibrillation , return of spontaneous circulation ( ROSC) or survival to hospital discharge ( SHD). We analyzed automated external defibrillation recordings of 80 patients with out-of-hospital VF cardiac arrest who received 284 defibrillations. We recorded the maximum amplitude during 3-second ECG tracings prior to each defibrillation attempt and the amplitude immediately prior to defibrillation. Both the amplitude just prior to defibrillation and the highest amplitude within 3 seconds of the defibrillation were significantly higher in successful vs unsuccessful defibrillations ( 0.21 vs 0.11 mV , P = < .0001 and 0.51 vs 0.36 mV , P = < .0001). Amplitude immediately prior to defibrillation and maximal amplitude within 3 seconds of defibrillation were also higher in defibrillations with ROSC vs. defibrillations without ROSC ( 0.23 vs. 0.12 mV , P < .0001; and 0.52 vs. 0.38 mV , P < .0001). In defibrillations that resulted in SHD , immediate pre-defibrillation amplitude and maximum amplitude were also significantly larger ( 0.20 vs. 0.11 mV , P < .0001; and 0.52 vs. 0.35 mV , P < .0001). Binary logistic regression including both measures showed that only immediate pre-defibrillation amplitude remained significantly associated with ROSC while maximal amplitude did not ( P = .006 and P = .135). Amplitude of the VF waveform at the moment of defibrillation has a strong association with successful defibrillation , ROSC , and SHD.
