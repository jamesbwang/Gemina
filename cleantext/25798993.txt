  Platelets are blood cells with numerous crucial pathophysiological roles in hemostasis , cardiovascular thrombotic events and cancer metastasis. Platelet activation requires the engagement of intracellular signalling pathways that involve protein-protein interactions ( PPIs). A better understanding of these pathways is therefore crucial for the development of selective anti-platelet drugs. New strategies for studying PPIs in human platelets are required to overcome limitations associated with conventional platelet research methods. For example , small molecule inhibitors can lack selectivity and are often difficult to design and synthesise. Additionally , development of transgenic animal models is costly and time-consuming and conventional recombinant techniques are ineffective due to the lack of a nucleus in platelets. Herein , we describe the generation of a library of novel , functionalised stapled peptides and their first application in the investigation of platelet PPIs. Moreover , the use of platelet-permeable stapled Bim BH3 peptides confirms the part of Bim in phosphatidyl-serine ( PS) exposure and reveals a role for the Bim protein in platelet activatory processes. Our work demonstrates that functionalised stapled peptides are a complementary alternative to conventional platelet research methods , and could make a significant contribution to the understanding of platelet signalling pathways and hence to the development of anti-platelet drugs.
