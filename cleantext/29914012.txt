  Improvement of skin microcirculation would be beneficial in transplanted tissues and thus , there is a demand for effective , reliable and harmless angiogenic treatments. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of capsaicin application ( CA) , the remote effect of capsaicin application ( REC) , the impact of remote ischemic conditioning ( RIC) , and the impact of combined remote ischemic conditioning with capsaicin application ( Comb) on human skin microcirculation. Perfusion changes were assessed using a laser Doppler device ( easyLDI , Aimago Lausanne). 30 healthy volunteers were enrolled and divided into two groups: 1) CA and REC: perfusion was assessed on both forearms after application of capsaicin cream on one forearm with an exposure time of 40 minutes. 2) RIC and Comb: perfusion of one forearm was assessed after four cycles of 5 min blood occlusion and 5 min reperfusion using a tourniquet on the contralateral upper arm and application of capsaicin on the ipsilateral forearm. Baseline skin perfusion measurements of both forearms were carried out initially and were used as intra-individual reference. 1) Skin perfusion significantly increased after capsaicin application ( CA = +328.3 % , p > 0.05). There was no remote skin perfusion change due to capsaicin ( REC). 2) RIC significantly improves skin perfusion ( RIC = +20.0 % , p < 0.05). The combination of RIC and CA does not improve skin perfusion compared to CA alone ( Comb). The conditioning techniques RIC and CA showed a significant increase in human skin perfusion , CA being superior to RIC. However , the combination of CA and RIC showed no additional improvement potential as compared to CA alone. Furthermore , a remote effect of capsaicin application could not be demonstrated. These results encourage to analyze if the conditioning treatments are also beneficial for transplanted tissue survival.
