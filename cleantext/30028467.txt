  Fabricating plasmonic nanowire waveguides and circuits by lithographic fabrication methods is highly desired for nanophotonic circuitry applications. Here we report an approach for fabricating metal nanowire networks by using electron beam lithography and metal film deposition techniques. The gold nanowire structures are fabricated on quartz substrates without using any adhesion layer but coated with a thin layer of Al2O3 film for immobilization. The thermal annealing during the Al2O3 deposition process decreases the surface plasmon loss. In a Y-shaped gold nanowire network , the surface plasmons can be routed to different branches by controlling the polarization of the excitation light , and the routing behavior is dependent on the length of the main nanowire. Simulated electric field distributions show that the zigzag distribution of the electric field in the nanowire network determines the surface plasmon routing. By using two laser beams to excite surface plasmons in a Y-shaped nanowire network , the output intensity can be modulated by the interference of surface plasmons , which can be used to design Boolean logic gates. We experimentally demonstrate that AND , OR , XOR and NOT gates can be realized in three-terminal nanowire networks , and NAND , NOR and XNOR gates can be realized in four-terminal nanowire networks. This work takes a step toward the fabrication of on-chip integrated plasmonic circuits.
