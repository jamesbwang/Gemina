  Taxanes are chemotherapeutic drugs employed in the clinic to treat a variety of malignancies. Despite their overall efficacy , cancer cells often display resistance to taxanes. Therefore , new strategies to increase the effectiveness of taxane-based chemotherapeutics are urgently needed. Multiple molecular players are linked to taxane resistance; these include efflux pumps , DNA repair mechanisms , and hypoxia-related pathways. In addition , emerging evidence indicates that both non-coding RNAs and epigenetic effectors might also be implicated in taxane resistance. Here we focus on the causes of taxane resistance , with the aim to envisage an integrated model of the ` taxane resistance phenome '. This model could help the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat taxane-resistant neoplasms.
