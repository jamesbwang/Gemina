  A thermo-sensitive methylcellulose ( MC) hydrogel was prepared using three types of vitamin derivatives with or without phosphate groups. The gelation behavior of each MC hydrogel containing vitamin or vitamin derivatives was monitored using a rheometer. The gelation rate and mechanical strength of the MC hydrogels were improved by vitamin derivatives with phosphate groups due to their salting-out effects , whereas their injectabilities retained proper maximum forces. Also , the vitamin derivatives with phosphate groups were released slower from the MC hydrogel than the vitamins without phosphate groups due to higher physical crosslinking densities. Therefore , this thermo-responsive MC hydrogel containing vitamin derivatives has a great potential as an injectable hydrogel for drug delivery.
