  Influenza<disease> has long been a global public health priority because of the threat of another global pandemic. Although data are available for the annual burden of seasonal influenza<disease> in many developed countries , fewer disease burden data are available for low-income and tropical countries. In recent years , however , the surveillance systems created as part of national pandemic preparedness efforts have produced substantial data on the epidemiology and impact of influenza<disease> in countries where data were sparse. These data are leading to greater interest in seasonal influenza<disease> , including implementation of vaccination programs. However , a lack of quality data on severe influenza<disease> , nonrespiratory outcomes , and high-risk groups , as well as a need for better mathematical models and economic evaluations , are some of the major gaps that remain. These gaps are the focus of multilateral research and surveillance efforts that will strengthen global efforts in influenza<disease> control in the future.
