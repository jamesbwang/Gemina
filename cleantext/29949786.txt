  CD133 + CD44 + cancer stem cells previously isolated from laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( LSCC) cell lines showed strong malignancy and tumorigenicity. However , the molecular mechanism underlying the enhanced malignancy remained unclear. Cell proliferation assay , spheroid-formation experiment , RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq) , miRNA-seq , bioinformatic analysis , quantitative real-time PCR , migration assay , invasion assay , and luciferase reporter assay were used to identify differentially expressed mRNAs , lncRNAs , circRNAs and miRNAs , construct transcription regulatory network , and investigate functional roles and mechanism of circRNA in CD133 + CD44 + laryngeal cancer stem cells. Differentially expressed genes in TDP cells were mainly enriched in the biological processes of cell differentiation , regulation of autophagy , negative regulation of cell death , regulation of cell growth , response to hypoxia , telomere maintenance , cellular response to gamma radiation , and regulation of apoptotic signaling , which are closely related to the malignant features of tumor cells. We constructed the regulatory network of differentially expressed circRNAs , miRNAs and mRNAs. qPCR findings for the expression of key genes in the network were consistent with the sequencing data. Moreover , our data revealed that circRNA hg19_circ_0005033 promotes proliferation , migration , invasion , and chemotherapy resistance of laryngeal cancer stem cells. This study provides potential biomarkers and targets for LSCC diagnosis and therapy , and provide important evidences for the heterogeneity of LSCC cells at the transcription level.
