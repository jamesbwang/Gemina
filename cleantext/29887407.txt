  To describe epidemiological characteristics of outpatients examined by university medical center ophthalmologists in emergency rooms ( ER) , and to determine factors associated with true emergencies. A monocentric cross-sectional study including all patients examined by an ophthalmologist in the ER of in the university hospital of Nancy over a two-month period was conducted. Demographics and medical characteristics were assessed. The visits were categorized by ophthalmologists as true emergencies or not. Among the 1,308 patients included , the median ( IQR) age was 49 ( 32-64) years , and 56 % were males. The main reasons for seeking care were eye redness ( 32.6 %) , eye pain<symptom> ( 30.0 %) , eye trauma ( 26.1 %) , and visual loss ( 23.3 %). Nearly 40 % of the consultations were judged as not truly emergent. Factors significantly associated with true emergencies were: age under 60 , male gender , some reasons for seeking care ( visual loss , eye redness , eye pain<symptom>) , and a period of less than 3 days between symptom occurrence and the ER visit. The proportion of non-emergent ER visits was relatively high , and factors associated with true emergencies have been identified in our study. Standardized protocols may be useful to help emergency physicians and nurses to determine when to refer a patient to an ophthalmologist.
