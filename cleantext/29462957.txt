  Energy saving has become a major concern for the developed society of our days. This paper presents a Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network ( WSAN) designed to provide support to an automatic intelligent system , based on the Internet of Things ( IoT) , which enables a responsible consumption of energy. The proposed overall system performs an efficient energetic management of devices , machines and processes , optimizing their operation to achieve a reduction in their overall energy usage at any given time. For this purpose , relevant data is collected from intelligent sensors , which are in-stalled at the required locations , as well as from the energy market through the Internet. This information is analysed to provide knowledge about energy utilization , and to improve efficiency. The system takes autonomous decisions automatically , based on the available information and the specific requirements in each case. The proposed system has been implanted and tested in a food factory. Results show a great optimization of energy efficiency and a substantial improvement on energy and costs savings.
