  To investigate the effects of capsiate treatment on hepatic hyperplasia<disease> in partially hepatectomized rats. The animals were divided into a Capsiate group ( CPH) , a Capsiate Post-Partial Hepatectomy group ( CPPH) and a Partial Hepatectomy Control group ( PH). CPH and CPPH animals received 60 mg/kg/day Capsiate for 30 days. Next , the rats underwent partial hepatectomy. CPPH animals continued to receive treatment for 48 h after partial hepatectomy. Liver tissue and intracardiac blood samples were obtained 24 or 48 h after PH. Capsiate treatment interfered with hepatic parameters , reducing the number of mitoses and apoptosis and increasing blood ALT and alkaline phosphatase concentrations. Capsiate treatment preceding hepatic surgery may compromise the initial period of postoperative recovery.
