  Positive attitudes toward evaluation among stakeholders are an important precondition for successful evaluation processes. However , empirical studies focusing on stakeholders ' attitudes toward evaluation are scarce. The present paper explores the approach of assessing social representations as indicators of people 's attitudes toward evaluation. In an exploratory study , two groups were surveyed: University students ( n = 60) with rather theoretical knowledge of evaluation and stakeholders ( n = 61) who had shortly before taken part in participatory evaluation studies. Both groups were asked to name their free associations with the term `` evaluation '' , which were subsequently analyzed lexicographically. The results indicate different social representations of evaluation in the two groups. The student group primarily saw evaluation as an `` appraisal '' , whereas the stakeholders emphasized the `` improvement '' resulting from evaluation. Implications for further evaluation research and practice are discussed.
