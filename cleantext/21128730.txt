  Potassium channel tetramerisation domain containing 9 ( KCTD9) , a member of KCTD family with a DNA-like pentapeptide repeat domain , was found to be increased particularly in NK cells of patients with HBV-induced acute-on-chronic liver failure ( HBV-ACLF) and experimental viral fulminant hepatitis<disease>. Knockdown of KCTD9 in immortalized NK cells inhibits cytokines production and cytotoxicity. As NK cell activation was shown to exacerbate liver damage in viral fulminant hepatitis<disease> , we propose that target inhibition of KCTD9 may prohibit NK cells activity and thus ameliorate liver damage in viral fulminant hepatitis<disease>. Hydrodynamic delivery of plasmid expressing short-hairpin RNA against KCTD9 resulted in impaired NK cells function as demonstrated by reduced cytokine production and cytotoxicity , and ameliorated liver injury as manifested by improved liver histology and survival rate. In contrast , delivery of plasmid expressing KCTD9 led to deteriorated disease progression. Interference with KCTD9 expression exert beneficial effect in viral fulminant hepatitis<disease> therapy. Such effect may be mediated by impairment of NK cell activation.
