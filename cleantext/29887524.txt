  The 5 ' end of HIV-1 long terminal repeat ( LTR) promoter plays an essential role in driving viral transcription and productive infection. Multiple host and viral factors regulate LTR activity and modulate HIV-1 latency. Manipulation of the HIV-1 LTR provides a potential therapeutic strategy for combating HIV-1 persistence. In this study , we identified an RNA-/ DNA-binding protein , Scaffold Attachment Factor B ( SAFB1) as a host-cell factor that represses HIV-1 transcription. We found that SAFB1 bound to HIV-1 5 `- LTR and significantly repressed 5 `- LTR-driven-viral transcription and HIV-1 infection of CD4
