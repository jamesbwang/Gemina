  Thymoquinone ( TQ) , as the active constituents of black cumin ( Nigella sativa) seed oil , has been reported to have potential protective effects on the cardiovascular system. This study aimed to investigate the effects and the underlying mechanisms of TQ on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R) injury in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts. Wister rat hearts were subjected to I/R and the experimental group were pretreated with TQ prior to I/R. Hemodynamic parameters , myocardial infarct size , cardiac marker enzymes , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , malondialdehyde ( MDA) content , and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were assayed. Compared with the untreated group , TQ preconditioning significantly improved cardiac function , reduced infarct size , decreased cardiac lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) and creatine kinase-MB ( CK-MB) levels , suppressed enedoxidative stress , and apoptosis. In addition , TQ treatment promoted autophagy , which was partially reversed by chloroquine ( CQ) , a kind of autophagy blocker. Our study suggests that TQ can protect heart against I/R injury , which is associated with anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects through activation of autophagy.
