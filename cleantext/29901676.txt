  The development of delivery systems for small interfering RNA ( siRNA) plays a key role in its clinical application. As the major delivery systems for siRNA , cationic polymer- or lipid-based vehicles are plagued by inherent issues. As proof of concept , a disulfide bond-containing amphiphilic Janus dendrimer ( ssJD) , which could be conveniently synthesized and readily scaled up with high reproducibility , was explored as a siRNA delivery system to circumvent these issues. The cationic hydrophilic head of this Janus dendrimer ensured strong and stable binding with negatively charged siRNA via electrostatic interactions , and the loaded siRNA was rapidly released from the obtained complexes under a redox environment. Therefore , after efficient internalization into tumor cells , redox-sensitive dendrimersome ( RSDs)/ siRNA exhibited significantly improved gene silencing efficacy.
