  Toosendanin ( TSN) is the main active compound in Toosendan Fructus and Meliae Cortex , two commonly used traditional Chinese medicines. TSN has been reported to induce hepatotoxicity , but its mechanism remains unclear. In this study , we demonstrated the critical role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2) in protecting against TSN-induced hepatotoxicity in mice and human normal liver L-02 cells. In mice , administration of TSN ( 10 mg/kg)- induced acute liver injury evidenced by increased serum alanine/aspartate aminotransferase ( ALT/AST) and alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) activities , and total bilirubin ( TBiL) content as well as the histological changes. Furthermore , TSN markedly increased liver reactive oxygen species ( ROS) and malondialdehyde ( MDA) levels , and decreased liver glutathione ( GSH) content and Nrf2 expression. In L-02 cells , TSN ( 2 Î¼M) time-dependently reduced glutamate-cysteine ligase ( GCL) activity and cellular expression of the catalytic/modify subunit of GCL ( GCLC/GCLM). Moreover , TSN reduced cellular GSH content and the increased ROS formation , and time-dependently decreased Nrf2 expression and increased the expression of the Nrf2 inhibitor protein kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 ( Keap1). Pre-administration of quercetin ( 40 , 80 mg/kg) effectively inhibited TSN-induced liver oxidative injury and reversed the decreased expression of Nrf2 and GCLC/GCLM in vivo and in vitro. In addition , the quercetin-provided protection against TSN-induced hepatotoxicity was diminished in Nrf2 knock-out mice. In conclusion , TSN decreases cellular GSH content by reducing Nrf2-mediated GCLC/GCLM expression via decreasing Nrf2 expression. Quercetin attenuates TSN-induced hepatotoxicity by inducing the Nrf2/GCL/GSH antioxidant signaling pathway. This study implies that inducing Nrf2 activation may be an effective strategy to prevent TSN-induced hepatotoxicity.
