  Atopic dermatitis<disease> is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that arises because of complex environmental , immunological , and genetic interactions. Adipokines are bioactive mediators secreted from adipocytes of white adipose tissue and are known to have a role in body metabolism and regulation of immune responses. Leptin is a proinflammatory adipokine that functions mainly to regulate food intake and energy expenditure. Few studies have implicated adipokines in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis<disease>. In this study , we investigated the association of three leptin gene polymorphisms: -2548 G > A ( rs7799039) , -188 C/A ( rs791620) , and A19G ( rs2167270) , with the incidence of atopic dermatitis<disease>. One hundred and sixty-four patients and one hundred and sixty-seven age- and gender-matched controls were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism procedure. A significant association was found between rs2167270 and the incidence of atopic dermatitis<disease> (
