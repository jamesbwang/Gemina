  Birch reductions of aromatic hydrocarbons by means of single-electron-transfer steps depend on alkali metals , ammonia<pathogen> , and cryogenic reaction conditions. In contrast , 2-naphthoyl-coenzyme A ( 2-NCoA) and 5,6-dihydro-2-NCoA ( 5,6-DHNCoA) reductases catalyze two two-electron reductions of the naphthoyl-ring system to tetrahydronaphthoyl-CoA at ambient temperature. Using a number of substrate analogues , we provide evidence for a Meisenheimer complex-analogous intermediate during 2-NCoA reduction , whereas the subsequent reduction of 5,6-dihydro-2-NCoA is suggested to proceed via an unprecedented cationic transition state. Using vibrational circular dichroism ( VCD) spectroscopy , we demonstrate that both enzymatic reductions are highly stereoselective in D
