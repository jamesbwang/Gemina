  Controversy exists regarding whether the kinesiology tape application direction affects muscle strength. Eighteen healthy volunteers ( 12 men , 6 women) participated. Kinesiology tape was randomly applied to the quadriceps muscles either from origin to insertion or from insertion to origin. A Biodex isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure the peak torque of the quadriceps pre-and post-taping. There was a significant difference in muscle strength after taping , regardless of the kinesiology tape application direction. There were no significant differences in the peak torque of the quadriceps between the 2 kinesiology tape application directions. The application of kinesiology tape application to the rectus<pathogen> femoris , vastus medialis , and vastus lateralis of the quadriceps increased the muscle torque , regardless of the tape application direction. Therefore , to enhance quadriceps strength , we recommend the application of kinesiology tape to 3 of the muscles of the quadriceps ( specifically , the rectus<pathogen> femoris , vastus medialis and vastus lateralis) , irrespective of the tape application direction.
