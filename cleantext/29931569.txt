  Many studies have evaluated the interplay of gravicentric , egocentric , and visual cues for our perception of the vertical , but little is known about their interplay for motor control. Thirty-five participants flipped a switch `` down '' in experimental conditions which systematically varied body posture<symptom> ( upright; tilted 45 ° left-ear-down) , visually indicated vertical ( absent; aligned with the long body axis; rotated 45 ° counterclockwise with respect to the long body axis) , and egocentric tactile information provided by a handhold ( absent; present). Since we were interested in the participants ' habitual rather than an instructed motor vertical , we did not specify which cues they should rely on. Our data revealed two response categories. Type-1 responses depended moderately on switch position; they relied mainly on gravicentric and egocentric cues , but only marginally on visual cues. Type-2 responses depended strongly on switch position; they relied on egocentric , but not on gravicentric or visual cues. We interpret the dependence on switch position as evidence that egocentric cues for type-2 responses may be anchored in the participants ' arm rather than in their long body axis. In conclusion , the habitual motor vertical can vary when available cues are not aligned , and this variability can compromise manual performance of human operators.
