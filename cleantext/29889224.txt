  Classrooms are characterized by interactions in a range of genres. The concise language required by expository interactions can be challenging for children who have atypical language , including children who are deaf and hard of hearing ( DHH). This study compared the way three groups of upper primary school students ( aged 8-13 years) taught a peer to play a new unfamiliar board game: ( a) DHH `` experts '' teaching a `` novice '' hearing peer; ( b) hearing experts teaching a DHH novice; and ( c) a hearing expert teaching a hearing novice. All DHH students were enrolled in mainstream schools and used spoken language as the main mode of communication. All three groups were able to convey game rules and purpose , and navigate clarifications. Differences emerged in the accuracy of the use of referents when instructing their peers how to play the game. The specific content vocabulary and the need to emphasize new concise information also challenged the DHH children. This study highlights the importance of including expository tasks in language support and intervention for children who are DHH.
