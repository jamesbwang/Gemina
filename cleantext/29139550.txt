  Mitral valve regurgitation ( MVR) is the reverse passage of blood through the mitral valve when the valve fails to close during ventricle contraction. Transcatheter mitral valve repair and replacement ( TMVR) is a recent technology that can benefit MVR patients as an alternative , minimally invasive , and safer solution than conventional open-heart surgical approaches. TMVR uses a catheter guided by ultrasonography to replace or repair the defective valve and has provided better clinical outcomes , decreased hospital stay , and reduced mortality rates. Therefore , TVMR should be made possible worldwide , especially in South-Asian regions where heart conditions such as atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and stroke are major contributing factors in a high postoperative mortality rate.
