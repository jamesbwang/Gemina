  To explore the interaction between alcohol-drinking and other factors of lifestyles on the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2 DM). From June2015 to February 2016 , 320 patients diagnosed with T2 DM in Huainan Eastern Hospital and 640 healthy cases at the same time in local medical examination center were randomlychosen to carry out the investigation , the differences between the two groups about demography , alcohol-drinking , smoking , physical activities and dietary habits were compared. Non-conditional logistic regression and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction ( GMDR) were used for statistical analysis. ( 1) Data from logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusting confounding factors , compared with Q1 , the intake marks of grains ( OR = 0. 310 , 95 % CI 0. 153-0. 628) , vegetables-fruits ( OR = 0. 444 , 95 % CI 0. 245-0. 806) , milk or dairy products ( OR = 0. 510 , 95 % CI 0. 329-0. 790) , beans ( OR = 0. 434 , 95 % CI 0. 212-0. 901) , red meat ( OR = 0. 461 , 95 % CI0. 229-0. 926) , western food ( OR = 0. 223 , 95 % CI 0. 076-0. 652) , sugary drinks ( OR = 0. 150 , 95 % CI 0. 035-0. 643) were Q5 and the BMI less than 24. 0 ( OR = 0. 189 , 95 % CI 0. 109-0. 329) were protective factors of T2 DM. However , frequent drinking ( OR = 3. 936 , 95 % CI 1. 145-8. 734) and moderate physical activities which were equal to or more than five times per week ( OR = 1. 558 , 95 % CI 1. 013-2. 876) were risk factors of T2 DM. There were multiplied interaction between frequent drinking and intake of grains ( Q5) ( OR = 0. 852 , 95 % CI 0. 765-0. 949) or vegetables-fruits ( Q5) ( OR = 0. 862 , 95 % CI 0. 757-0. 982) or adequate moderate physical activities ( OR = 0. 613 , 95 % CI 0. 468-0. 803). There were additive interactions between frequent drinking and high intake of red meat or sugary drinks or adequate moderate physical activities. GMDR analysis showed that interaction among sugary drinks , red meat and frequent drinking on the risk of T2 DM may exist ( P = 0. 001). Frequent drinking and some other controllable factors have combined effect to increase the risk of T2 DM.
