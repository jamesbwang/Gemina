  Some major changes have occurred in emergency department ( ED) organization since the early 2000s , such as the establishment of triage nurses and short-track systems. The objectives of this study were to describe the characteristics of French EDs organization and users , based on a nationwide cross-sectional survey. The French Emergency Survey was a nationwide cross-sectional survey. All patients presenting to all EDs during a 24-hr period of June 2013 were included. Data collection concerned ED characteristics as well as patient characteristics. Among the 736 EDs in France , 734 were surveyed. Triage nurses and short-track systems were respectively implemented in 73 % and 41 % of general EDs. The median proportion of patients aged > 75 years was 14 % and median hospitalisation rate was 20 %. During the study period , 48,711 patients presented to one of the 734 EDs surveyed. Among them , 7 % reported having no supplementary health or universal coverage ( for people with lower incomes). Overall , 50 % of adult patients had been seen by the triage nurse in less than 5 minutes , 74 % had a time to first medical contact shorter than one hour and 55 % had an ED length of stay shorter than 3 hours. The French Emergency Survey is the first study to provide data on almost all EDs in France. It underlines how ED organization has been redesigned to face the increase in the annual census. French EDs appear to have a particular role for vulnerable people: age-related vulnerability and socio-economic vulnerability with an over-representation of patients without complementary health coverage.
