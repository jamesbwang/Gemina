  The highly valued medicinal tiger milk mushroom ( also known as The mechanism involved in the cytotoxic activities of F5 against MCF7 cells was elucidated by flow cytometry-based apoptosis detection , caspases activity measurement , and expression profiling of apoptosis markers by western blotting. Molecular attributes of F5 were further mined from Apoptosis induction in MCF7 cells by F5 may involve a cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways with upregulation of caspase-8 and -9 activities and a marked decrease of Bcl-2. On the other hand , the levels of pro-apoptotic Bax , BID , and cleaved BID were increased accompanied by observable actin cleavage. At gene level , F5 composed of three predicted non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms ( T > C) and an alternative 5 ' splice site. Findings from this study provide an advanced framework for further investigations on cancer therapeutics development from
