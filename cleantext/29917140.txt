  Aromatase inhibitors improve disease-free survival compared with tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational ( TEAM) trial compared exemestane monotherapy with sequential therapy of tamoxifen followed by exemestane. The trial failed to show a statistically significant difference between treatment arms. A robust translational program was established to investigate predictive biomarkers. A tissue microarray was retrospectively constructed using a subset of patient tissues ( n = 4631) from the TEAM trial ( n = 9766). Immunohistochemistry was performed for biomarkers , classed into three groups: MAPK pathway , NF-kappa B pathway , and estrogen receptor ( ER) phosphorylation. Expression was analyzed for association with relapse-free survival ( RFS) at 2.5 and 10 years and treatment regimen using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. In univariate analysis , ER167 ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 0.71 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.59 to 0.85 , P < .001) , IKKα ( HR = 0.74 , 95 % CI = 0.60 to 0.92 , P = .005) , Raf-1338 ( HR = 0.64 , 95 % CI = 0.52 to 0.80 , P < .001) , and p44/42 MAPK202/204 ( HR = 0.77 , 95 % CI = 0.64 to 0.92 , P = .004) were statistically significantly associated with improved RFS at 10 years in patients receiving sequential therapy. Associations were strengthened when IKKα , Raf-1338 , and ER167 were combined into a cumulative prognostic score ( HR = 0.64 , 95 % CI = 0.52 to 0.77 , P < .001). Patients with an all negative IKKα , Raf-1338 , and ER167 score favored exemestane monotherapy ( odds ratio = 0.56 , 95 % CI = 0.35 to 0.90). In multivariable analysis , the IKKα , Raf-1338 , and ER167 score ( P = .001) was an independent prognostic factor for RFS at 10 years in patients receiving sequential therapy. The IKKα , Raf-1338 , and ER167 score is an independent predictive biomarker for lower recurrence on sequential therapy. Negative expression may further offer predictive value for exemestane monotherapy.
