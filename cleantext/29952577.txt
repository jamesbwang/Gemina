  Alter and Hershfield ( 2014) recently published a set of studies suggesting that people often search for existential meaning as they approach a new decade in chronological age. The purpose of the current research was to replicate their experimental study ( Study 2 in their article) and extend their findings using additional operational measures of search for meaning. Study 1 was a replication comparing the two conditions used in the original study ( i.e. , experimental and baseline control) , whereas Studies 2 and 3 were direct replications of the original methods using all three conditions ( i.e. , experimental , baseline control , and birthday control). All replications found general support for the original claims with important caveats. Specifically , whereas Studies 1 and 3 replicated their main findings , Study 2 did not. Importantly , however , a factor analysis of Alter and Hershfield 's meaning-seeking measure revealed two factors underlying a search for meaning: life-reflection and perceived value of meaning. Across all studies , findings suggest that people are significantly more likely to engage in a life review as they begin a new epoch in their lives while there were no differences in their perceived value of meaning. A reinterpretation of Alter and Hershfield 's findings is discussed. ( PsycINFO Database Record
