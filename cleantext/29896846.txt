  Fibrinogen ( Fg) adsorption is an important mechanism underlying cell adhesion to biomaterials and was the major focus of the author 's research career. This article summarizes our work on Fg adsorption , with citations of related work as appropriate. The molecular properties of Fg that promote adsorption and cell adhesion will be described. In addition , the adsorption behavior of Fg from buffer , binary solutions with other proteins , and blood plasma will be discussed , including the Vroman effect. Studies of platelet adhesion to surfaces preadsorbed with blood plasmas selectively deficient in Fg , vitronectin ( Vn) , fibronectin ( Fn) , or von Willebrand 's factor ( vWf) will be reviewed. These studies clearly showed a major role for Fg in platelet adhesion under static conditions and both Fg and vWf for adhesion from flowing suspensions , but no significant role for Vn or Fn. However , it was also shown that platelet adhesion was poorly correlated with the total amount of adsorbed Fg , but very well correlated with the binding of antibodies specific to the cell binding domains of Fg. A brief overview of nonfouling surfaces for prevention of Fg adsorption will be given. A more extensive discussion of structural changes in Fg after its adsorption is included , including changes detected with both physicochemical and biological methods. A short discussion of the state of the art of structural determination of adsorbed proteins with computational methods is also given. A final section identifies Fg adsorption as the single most important event determining the biocompatibility of implants in soft tissue and in blood. This article is protected by copyright.
