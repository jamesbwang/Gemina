  The formation of correct synaptic structures and neuronal connections is paramount for normal brain development and a functioning adult brain. The integrin family of cell adhesion receptors and their ligands play essential roles in the control of several processes regulating neuronal connectivity- including neurite outgrowth , the formation and maintenance of synapses , and synaptic plasticity- that are affected in neurodevelopmental disorders , such as autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs) and schizophrenia. Many ASD- and schizophrenia-associated genes are linked to alterations in the genetic code of integrins and associated signalling pathways. In non-neuronal cells , crosstalk between integrin-mediated adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton , and the regulation of integrin activity ( affinity for extracellular ligands) are widely studied in healthy and pathological settings. In contrast , the roles of integrin-linked pathways in the central nervous system remains less well defined. In this Review , we will provide an overview of the known pathways that are regulated by integrin-ECM interaction in developing neurons and in adult brain. We will also describe recent advances in the identification of mechanisms that regulate integrin activity in neurons , and highlight the interesting emerging links between integrins and neurodevelopment.
