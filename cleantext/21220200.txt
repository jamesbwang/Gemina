  Agricultural production combined with planting and breeding , which can reduce chemical fertilizer and pesticide applications , reduce losses due to natural disasters , and improve the output and quality of agricultural products , is an important way to achieve green , circular and efficient production. To assess effects on soil bacterial community structure , a vegetable-eel-earthworm integrated planting and breeding platform ( VEE-IPBP) combined with experiment planting was established at Chongming Island , Shanghai and compared to traditional planting. High-throughput sequencing to reveal soil bacterial community structure was performed on samples collected at 0 , 3 and 6 years after implementation of the two models. Over time , the Shannon index first increased and then decreased in the VEE-IPBP system and was reduced by 3.2 % compared to the traditional planting ( In the same time and space scale , the single-degree planting method of dryland vegetables under mechanical cultivation is adopted) ( p < 0.05). In contrast , Chao and Ace indices were increased by 2.4 % and 3.2 %. Thus , soil bacterial diversity was markedly different in the two planting models. The abundance of Proteus<pathogen> , Cyanophyta and Cyanophyta in soil increased after 6 years , and the proportion of Lysinibacillus<pathogen> increased significantly , contributing to improvement in soil disease resistance. Redundancy analysis ( RDA) showed that the soil pH and water content were the main factors influencing the change in soil bacterial community structure in the two planting models , and the dominant species of soil bacteria were Lysobacter and Bacillus.
