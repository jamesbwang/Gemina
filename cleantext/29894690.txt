  The co-engagement of fragment crystallizable ( Fc) gamma receptors ( FcγRs) with the Fc region of recombinant immunoglobulin monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) and its contribution to therapeutic activity has been extensively studied. For example , Fc-FcγR interactions have been shown to be important for mAb-directed effector cell activities , as well as mAb-dependent forward signaling into target cells via receptor clustering. Here we identify a function of mAbs targeting T cell-expressed antigens that involves FcγR co-engagement on antigen-presenting cells ( APCs). In the case of mAbs targeting CTLA-4 and TIGIT , the interaction with FcγR on APCs enhanced antigen-specific T cell responses and tumoricidal activity. This mechanism extended to an anti-CD45RB mAb , which led to FcγR-dependent regulatory T cell expansion in mice.
