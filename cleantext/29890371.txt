In this descriptive phenomenological research study , 10 undergraduate nursing faculty participated in semi-structured interviews at a public university in the North-Eastern region of United States. Observations and semi-structured interviews were conducted. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. Colaizzi seven steps analysis framework was used to identify major themes in the collected data. The clear , detailed , and sequential procedural processes in both data collection and analysis ensured rigorous and trustworthy results. Five mitigating OSCE strategies utilized by the faculty included: administrative and technical supports , use of clinical instructors during evaluation , faculty OSCE education , limitation of validation to the required skills essential for professional practice , and collaboration among all course faculty members.
