  Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance ( MGUS) is the most frequent plasma cell disorder that commonly affects elderly patients. Although it is an asymptomatic condition , as well as smoldering myeloma ( SMM) , the risk of progression to multiple myeloma requiring therapy or other B-cell disorders varies greatly for individual patients , remaining low for MGUS ( 1 % per year) , while higher and not uniform for SMM patients ( 10 % per year). This scenario implies some special considerations regarding assessment and follow-up , especially in the elderly. In this review , we provide the updated diagnostic criteria of monoclonal gammopathies proposed by the International Myeloma Working Group ( IMGW); the current recommendations for the assessment of asymptomatic plasma cell disorders , with some concerns about the need of geriatric evaluation in the elderly population , the importance of distinguishing myeloma-related symptomatology from signs or symptoms caused by multiple chronic conditions typically found in the elderly. Finally , the identification of predictor markers of progression has enabled a proposal of risk-adapted follow-up strategies in MGUS and SMM that should be implemented in clinical practice. Although the standard of care is observation for MGUS and SMM patients as well , a recent randomized trial targeting high-risk SMM showed the clinical benefit of early intervention. The change of the treatment paradigm is also very promising and feasible for elderly patients , as long as a comprehensive geriatric assessment is conducted to optimize early treatment and reach maximum benefit with minimum toxicity , in other words , to ensure a better quality of life for these patients.
