  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the macular choroidal thickness in obese children with and without insulin resistance ( IR). Thirty-six patients with obesity and 26 healthy volunteers were included in this cross-sectional study. The choroidal thickness was measured with enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography ( EDI-OCT) at the fovea and at positions 500 μm , 1000 μm , 1500 μm nasal and temporal to the fovea. The choroidal thickness measurements of the groups were compared and the correlation between the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR) and choroidal thickness values was evaluated. The average choroidal thickness in the obese group was significantly lower than that of controls at locations 1000 μm ( 303.31 ± 58.52 vs. 340.58 ± 69.47 , p = 0.026) and 1500 μm ( 284.14 ± 65.06 vs. 336.85 ± 71.37 , p = 0.004) temporal to the fovea. A subgroup analysis depending on the presence of IR revealed that the choroidal thickness measurements at all positions were thinner in obese children without IR compared to children with IR and healthy controls. This thinning reached a statistical significance at locations 500 μm temporal , 1000 μm temporal and 1500 μm temporal to the fovea ( p = 0.03 , p = 0.009 and p = 0.006; respectively). There was a moderate correlation between the choroidal thickness measurements and HOMA-IR values ( r-values between 0.37 and 0.48; p < 0.05). Our results suggest that obesity and IR may have an influence on the choroidal thickness in children. Longitudinal studies will clarify whether these choroidal changes are progressive and are a sign of microvascular dysfunction in childhood obesity.
