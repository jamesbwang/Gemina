  Nurse practitioners ( NPs) are helping to bridge the gap not only in primary care but also in specialty practice. In an outpatient , neurosurgical spinal clinic in the midwest , patient volume exceeded provider availability , and to rectify this problem , a proposal for an NP triage system and an NP-led spinal clinic was presented. The aim of this project was to use NPs to facilitate patient triage in an outpatient neurosurgical practice to expedite patients ' access to care and ultimately improve patient satisfaction , outcomes , and healthcare expenditure. A prospective comparison study was conducted in which NP patient triaging involved surgeons and NPs simultaneously reviewing patient cases over a 1-month period , with a total number of reviews equaling 100 reviews per NP , for a grand total of 200 test reviews. Data were analyzed for a comparison of NP and surgeon input , in reference to patient diagnosis and appropriate NP referral for surgical consultation. Institutional review board approval was sought and granted. Nurse practitioner and surgeon diagnoses were congruent 100 % of the time. Patients triaged were correctly referred to the clinic for surgical consultation , with a sensitivity of 95.7 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 90.8 % -98.4 %) and a specificity of 73.8 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 60.9 % -84.2 %). Utilization of NPs to facilitate triage and treatment of the outpatient neurosurgical spine patient is a sustainable patient-centered care delivery model that leads to improvements in access and ensures exceptional quality outcomes.
