  A sensitive , fast , and effective method , field-amplified sample stacking ( FASS) in capillary electrophoresis , has been established for the separation and determination of corynoxine and corynoxine B. Hydroxypropyl-β-CD ( HP-β-CD) and tetrabutylammonium-L-glutamic acid ( TBA-L-Glu) were used as additives in the separation system. Electrokinetic injection was chosen to introduce sample from inlet at 10 kV for 50 s after a water plug ( 0.5 psi , 4 s) was injected to permit FASS. The running buffer ( pH 6.1) was composed of 40 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate solution , 130 mM HP-β-CD , and 10 mM TBA-L-Glu and the separation voltage was 20 kV. Under the optimum conditions , corynoxine and corynoxine B were successfully enriched and separated within 12 min and the sensitivity was improved approximately by 700-900 folds. Calibration curves were in a good linear relationship within the range of 62.5-5.00 × 10
