  In general , exploitation of rock materials , such as limestone or granite exploitation , can cause serious damage to the environment near a mine area. With economic development and the ever-increasing demand for ore resources , mining activities have induced very serious environmental issues in China. Therefore , environmental restoration work around mines in China is urgently required. This study explores the Chuankou open-pit limestone quarry in Tongchuan City , Shaanxi Province , Northwest China , as the engineering case. The environmental issues caused by over 40 years of limestone exploitation , including land degradation , land occupation , dust pollution and potential geological disasters , were investigated. Combining the characteristics of this quarry with a summary of previous studies on environmental restoration work , this paper proposes a novel and systematic method that was comprehensively carried out through engineering and revegetation measures. The engineering measure , that is , the construction of an artificial slope by using local abandoned construction materials , solved the environmental problems in this quarry and provided site conditions favourable for revegetation. The revegetation measure restored the local ecosystem. This method provides both a new idea for the sustainable development of a mining area and a useful reference for analogous engineering cases.
