  The aim of the study was to evaluate bone regeneration using a canine model with surgically created periodontal defects filled for 12 weeks using a stratified biomaterial consisting in a biphasic calcium phosphate ( BCP) covered with a crosslinking hydrogel acting as polymer membrane of silated hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ( Si-HPMC) as the tested new concept. Bilateral , critical-sized , defects were surgically created at the mandibular premolar teeth of six adult beagle dogs. The defects were randomly allocated and: ( i) left empty for spontaneous healing or filled with: ( ii) BCP and a collagen membrane; ( iii) BCP and hydrogel Si-HPMC membrane. At 12 weeks , the experimental conditions resulted in significantly enhanced bone regeneration in the test BCP/Si-HPMC group. Within the limits of this study , we suggest that the hydrogel Si-HPMC may act as an occlusive barrier to protect bone area from soft connective tissue invasion and then effectively contribute to enhance bone regeneration.
