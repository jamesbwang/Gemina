  The clastogenic effects of water samples in seven locations of Lake Sevan ( Armenia) with the application of Trad-MCN ( micronuclei) bioassay using Tradescantia ( clone 02) were investigated. A significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei in tetrads of pollen microspores and tetrads with micronuclei exposed to the test samples compared to the control has been revealed. A multivariate analysis indicated linkage between the frequencies of occurrence of micronuclei in the cells and Ni and Co ions. The results were compared with the endpoints of another Tradescantia-based test system ( stamen hair mutation test) performed on the same water samples and generation of the plant: occurrences of micronuclei in sporogenic cells coincided with that of non-surviving stamen hair.
