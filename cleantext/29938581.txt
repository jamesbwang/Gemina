  In most cases , macroautophagy/autophagy serves to alleviate cellular stress and acts in a pro-survival manner. However , the effects of autophagy are highly contextual , and autophagic cell death ( ACD) is emerging as an alternative paradigm of ( stress- and drug-induced) cell demise. AT 101 ( (-)- gossypol) , a natural compound from cotton seeds , induces ACD in glioma cells as confirmed here by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of ATG5 that partially , but significantly rescued cell survival following AT 101 treatment. Global proteomic analysis of AT 101-treated U87MG and U343 glioma cells revealed a robust decrease in mitochondrial protein clusters , whereas HMOX1 ( heme oxygenase 1) was strongly upregulated. AT 101 rapidly triggered mitochondrial membrane depolarization , engulfment of mitochondria within autophagosomes and a significant reduction of mitochondrial mass and proteins that did not depend on the presence of BAX and BAK1. Conversely , AT 101-induced reduction of mitochondrial mass could be reversed by inhibiting autophagy with wortmannin , bafilomycin A ACD , autophagic cell death; ACN , acetonitrile; AT 101 , (-)- gossypol; BAF , bafilomycin A
