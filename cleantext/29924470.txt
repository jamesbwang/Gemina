  The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of congenital fetal anomalies reported among infertile Iranian women treated with letrozole compared to those treated with Clomiphene Citrate ( CC). This retrospective case-control study was performed based on information available from infertile patients referred to the Akbar-Abadi Hospital IVF Center , Tehran , Iran , undergoing ovulation induction ( OI) or intrauterine insemination ( IUI) cycles from 2007 to 2014. We compared sonographic findings , fertility results , pregnancy complications and congenital anomalies in two groups of women treated with letrozole and CC. Overall , the results of the 2009 cycles including 1237 CC cycles and 772 letrozole cycles were evaluated. In spite of a higher chance of ovulation following CC treatment , overall fertility rates were similar in the two treatment groups. The frequency of adverse outcomes of pregnancy was similar in the two groups , except for the incidence of first trimester abortion<disease> , which was significantly higher in the CC-treated group. The frequency of fetal anomalies and major chromosomal abnormalities in the Letrozole group was 4.76 % ( five cases) , and in the CC group , it was 2.12 % ( three cases). This difference was not statistically significant. Based on the findings of this study , it seems that the incidence of congenital anomalies in offspring after OI with letrozole is not increased compared to the CC group.
