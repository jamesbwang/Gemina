  Circular RNAs ( circRNAs) are a large class of RNAs that have previously been identified to be involved in certain diseases , including the development of cancer. However , the role of circ_001569 in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) remains unknown. In the present study , it was demonstrated that expression levels of circ_001569 were significantly increased in NSCLC tissues compared with in adjacent normal tissues. Increased circ_001569 expression was closely associated with tumor differentiation , lymph node metastasis and Tumor-Node-Metastasis classification in NSCLC. Patients that exhibited higher circ_001569 expression demonstrated a poorer survival outcome compared with patients with lower circ_001569 expression. Functional assay results indicated that the knockdown of circ_001569 inhibited the cell proliferation ability of NSCLC
