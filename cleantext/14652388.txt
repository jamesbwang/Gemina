  Revision total hip arthroplasty in the setting of severe femoral bone loss can be challenging , with salvage options often limited to modular tapered stems , allograft prosthetic composites , and megaprostheses. This case highlights a 79-year-old woman with 2 years of thigh pain who is 8 years status post a revision proximal femoral allograft prosthetic composite reconstruction. Radiographs demonstrated significant stem subsidence into the femoral condyle. In an attempt to avoid a total femoral replacement and spare her functioning native knee , a tibial cone was used in conjunction with a proximal femoral replacement to structurally fill the flaring femoral canal and serve as a stable pedestal for the megaprosthesis body and provide the potential for biologic ingrowth. At 12-month follow-up , she ambulates with a cane , and radiographs reveal stable implant position.
