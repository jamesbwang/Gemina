  Prior studies have shown a close link between exercise and development of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. How much exercise restriction reduces ventricular arrhythmia ( VA) , how genotype modifies its benefit , and whether it reduces risk sufficiently to defer implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( ICD) placement in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy are unknown. We interviewed 129 arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy patients ( age: 34.0 Â± 14.8 years; male: 60 %) with ICDs ( 36 % primary prevention) about exercise participation. Exercise change was defined as annual exercise duration and dose in the 3 years before clinical presentation minus that after presentation. The primary outcome was appropriate ICD therapy for VA.. During the 5.1 years ( interquartile range: 2.7-10.8 years) after presentation , 74 % ( 95/129) patients reduced exercise dose and 85 ( 66 %) patients experienced the primary outcome. In multivariate analyses , top tertile reduction in exercise duration and dose were both associated with less VA ( duration: hazard ratio: 0.23 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.07-0.81); dose: hazard ratio: 0.14 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.04-0.44)). Greater reduction in exercise dose conferred greater reduction in VA ( Exercise restriction should be recommended to all arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy patients with ICDs. Patients who are `` gene-elusive '' and those with primary-prevention devices may particularly benefit. Exercise reduction is unlikely to reduce arrhythmia sufficiently in high-risk patients to alter decision-making regarding ICD implantation.
