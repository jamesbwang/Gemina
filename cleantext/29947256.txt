  The use of mesenchymal stromal cell ( MSC) transplantation to repair the injured spinal cord has shown consistent benefits in preclinical models. However , the low survival rate of grafted MSC is one of the most important problems. In the injured spinal cord , transplanted cells are exposed to hypoxic conditions and exposed to nutritional deficiency caused by poor vascular supply. Also , the transplanted MSCs face cytotoxic stressors that cause cell death. The aim of this study was to compare adipose-derived MSCs ( AD-MSCs) and bone marrow-derived MSCs ( BM-MSCs) isolated from individual C57BL6/J mice in relation to: ( i) cellular characteristics , ( ii) tolerance to hypoxia , oxidative stress and serum-free conditions , and ( iii) cellular survival rates after transplantation. AD-MSCs and BM-MSCs exhibited a similar cell surface marker profile , but expressed different levels of growth factors and cytokines. To research their relative stress tolerance , both types of stromal cells were incubated at 20.5 % O
