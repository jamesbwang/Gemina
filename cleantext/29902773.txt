  Intrinsic and extrinsic factors are responsible for the transition of soluble proteins into aggregated form. Trifluoroethanol is among such potent extrinsic factor which facilitates the formation of aggregated structure. It disrupts the interactive forces and destabilizes the native structure of the protein. The present study investigates the effect of trifluoroethanol ( TFE) on garlic cystatin. Garlic cystatin was incubated with increasing concentration of TFE ( 0-90 % v/v) for 4 h. Incubation of GPC with TFE induces structural changes thereby resulting in the formation of aggregates. Inactivation of garlic phytocystatin was confirmed by cysteine proteinase inhibitory activity. Garlic cystatin at 30 % TFE exhibits native-like secondary structure and high ANS fluorescence , thus suggesting the presence of molten globule state. Circular dichroism and FTIR confirmed the transition of the native alpha-helical structure of garlic cystatin to the beta-sheet structure at 60 % TFE. Furthermore , increased ThT fluorescence and redshift in Congo red absorbance assay confirmed the presence of aggregates. Rayleigh and turbidity assay was also performed to validate the aggregation results. Scanning electron microscopy was followed to analyze the morphological changes which confirm the presence of sheath-like structure at 60 % TFE. The study sheds light on the conformational behavior of a plant protein when kept under stress condition induced by an extrinsic factor.
