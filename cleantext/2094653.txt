  The individuals who have been afflicted with mandibular defects involving soft and hard tissue loss are subjected to functional , psychological and social consequences. Rehabilitation is of prime importance in restoring self confidence and improving the quality of life. Complex mandibular defects can be successfully rehabilitated with the three dimensional ( 3D) computerized diagnostic technique ( Simplant-Dentsply sirona implant). one of the important tools for measuring the oral health status by scale knows as oral health impact profile ( OHIP). OHIP is a scale particularly designed to measure the quality of life and its influence pertaining to functional and psychological aspects. This report describes the prosthetic rehabilitation posttraumatic mandibular defect with 3D SimPlant software and stereolithography. With the application of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing technology , guided implant prosthesis could definitely improve masticatory performance and esthetics , thereby enhancing oral health-related quality of life.
