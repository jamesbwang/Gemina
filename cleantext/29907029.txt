  Attempts to establish an absolute single-ion hydration free energy scale have followed multiple strategies. Two central themes consist of ( 1) employing bulk pair thermodynamic data and an underlying interfacial-potential-free model to partition the hydration free energy into individual contributions ( Marcus , Latimer , and tetraphenyl-arsonium/tetraphenyl-borate ( TATB) methods) or ( 2) utilizing bulk thermodynamic and cluster data to estimate the free energy to insert a proton into water , including in principle an interfacial potential contribution ( the cluster pair approximation ( CPA)). While the results for the hydration free energy of the proton agree remarkably well between the three approaches in the first category , the value differs from the CPA result by roughly +10 kcal/mol , implying a value for the effective electrochemical surface potential of water of -0.4 V. This paper provides a computational re-analysis of the TATB method for single-ion free energies using quasichemical theory. A previous study indicated a significant discrepancy between the free energies of hydration for the TA cation and the TB anion. We show that the main contribution to this large computed difference is an electrostatic artifact arising from modeling interactions in periodic boundaries. No attempt is made here to develop more accurate models for the local ion/solvent interactions that may lead to further small free energy differences between the TA and TB ions , but the results clarify the primary importance of interfacial potential effects for analysis of the various free energy scales. Results are also presented , related to the TATB assumption in the organic solvents dimethyl sulfoxide and 1,2-dichloroethane.
