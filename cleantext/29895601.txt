  Because of shared risk factors between coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease , patients with a history of transient ischemic attack ( TIA) or stroke are at greater risk of developing coronary artery disease , which may require percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). However , there remains a paucity of research examining outcomes after PCI in these patients. We analyzed consecutive patients who underwent PCI between January 1 , 2013 , and March 31 , 2016 , at 47 Michigan hospitals and identified those with a history of TIA/stroke. We used propensity score matching to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics and compared in-hospital outcomes between patients with and without a history of TIA/stroke. We compared rates of 90-day readmission and long-term mortality in a subset of patients. Among 98730 patients who underwent PCI , 10915 had a history of TIA/stroke. After matching ( n = 10618 per group) , a history of TIA/stroke was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital stroke ( adjusted odds ratio , 2.04; 95 % confidence interval , 1.41-2.96; A history of TIA/stroke was common in patients who underwent PCI and was associated with increased risks of in-hospital stroke , 90-day readmission , and long-term mortality. Given the devastating consequences of post-PCI stroke , patients with a history of TIA/stroke should be counseled on this increased risk before undergoing PCI.
