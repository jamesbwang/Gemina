  Analyze the effectiveness of a BPCI ( Bundle Payments for Care Improvement) initiative for patients who would be included in a future potential Surgical Hip and Femur Fracture Treatment ( SHFFT) bundle. Retrospective cohort SETTING:: Single Academic Institution PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS:: Patients discharged with operative fixation of a hip or femur fracture ( DRG codes 480-482) between 1/2015 - 10/2016 were included. A BPCI initiative based upon an established program for BPCI Total Joint Arthroplasty ( TJA) was initiated for patients with hip and femur fractures in January 2016. Patients were divided into non-bundle ( care before initiative) and bundle ( care with initiative) cohorts. Application of BPCI principles MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:: Length of stay , location of discharge , readmissions RESULTS:: 116 patients participated in the `` institutional bundle , '' and 126 received care prior to the initiative. There was a trend towards decreased mean length of stay , ( 7.3 ± 6.3 days vs. 6.8 ± 4.0 days , p = 0.457) and decreased readmission within 90 days ( 22.2 % vs. 18.1 % , p = 0.426). The number of patients discharged home doubled ( 30.2 % vs. 14.3 % , p = 0.008). There was no difference in readmission rates in bundle vs. non-bundle patients based on discharged home status; however , bundle patients discharged to SNF trended towards less readmissions than non-bundle patients discharged to SNF ( 37.3 % vs. 50.6 % , p = 0.402). Mean episode cost reduction due to initiative was estimated to be $ 6,450 using Medicare reimbursement data. This study demonstrates the potential success of a BPCI initiative at one institution in decreasing post-acute care facility utilization and cost of care when used for a hip and femur fracture population.
