  New materials of the ornithischian dinosaur Manidens condorensis highlight a strong heterodonty between the upper and lower dentitions and reveal a novel occlusion type previously unreported in herbivorous dinosaurs. The diamond-shaped maxillary teeth have prominent cingular entolophs in a V- to Z-shaped configuration that are absent in dentary teeth. These cingular entolophs bear denticles and serrations with vertical wear that is coplanar with the apical wear facets , supporting their involvement in chewing. The separated apical and basal wear in dentary teeth is consistent with the apical and cingular wear in maxillary teeth , indicating an alternate occlusion , an orthal jaw motion , and shearing interactions between marginal and cingular edges in a double occlusion. Measurements of the length and wear area along the marginal and cingular edges indicate that the latter are functionally equivalent to adding eight teeth to a maxillary toothrow of ten , almost doubling the lengths of cutting edges and the degree of intraoral processing , while maintaining a plesiomorphic skull anatomy , an adaptation to herbivory unique in Ornithischia.
