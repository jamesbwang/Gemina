  Spectral detector computed tomography ( SDCT) is a new CT technology that uses a dual-layer detector to perform energy separation. We aim to assess 3 clinical concepts using a phantom model: noise profile across the virtual monoenergetic ( VME) spectrum , accuracy of iodine quantification , and virtual noncontrast ( VNC) reconstructions ' ability to remove iodine contribution to attenuation. Six vials containing varying concentrations of iodinated contrast ( 0-6 mg/mL) diluted in water were placed in a water bath and scanned on an SDCT scanner. Virtual monoenergetic ( 40-200 keV at 10-keV increments) , iodine-no-water , and VNC reconstructions were created. Attenuation ( in Hounsfield units ( HU)) , VME noise at each energy level , CT-derived iodine concentration , and VNC attenuation were recorded. Virtual monoenergetic noise was improved at all energies compared with conventional images ( conventional , 9.8-11.2; VME , 7.5-9.5). Noise profile showed a slightly higher image noise at 40 keV , but was otherwise relatively flat across the energy spectrum. On iodine-no-water reconstructions , measured varied from actual iodine concentration by Â± 0.1 mg/mL ( SD , 0.16-0.36). Virtual noncontrast attenuation was within 5 HU of water attenuation at all iodine concentrations. Reconstructions of SDCT show lower VME image noise , accurate iodine quantification , and VNC attenuation values within 5 HU of expected in a phantom model.
