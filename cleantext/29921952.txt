  To report surgical outcomes and endothelial cell density ( ECD) trends up to 2 years post-operatively in the first cohort of eyes undergoing Descemet 's membrane endothelial keratoplasty ( DMEK) for low-to-moderate risk indications at our UK centre. Tight corneal sutures were used to ensure high intraoperative pressure from intracameral air for 10-min and to maintain a good post-operative air fill. Outcomes were compared to a prior series at our unit of similar eyes having Descemet 's stripping endothelial keratoplasty ( DSEK). Retrospective , interventional series. Inclusions<disease>: all DMEKs with a minimum of 1-month follow-up. prior glaucoma surgery , penetrating keratoplasty or anterior chamber lens. 88 DMEKs met inclusion. Median follow-up: 332 days. Main indication: Fuchs dystrophy ( 90 %). re-bubbling 2 % , primary failure 6 % , retinal detachment 2 % , rejection 3 %. At 3 months , BCVA ≥ 6/6 and ≥ 6/9 were 67 % and 86 % , respectively. Graft survival at both 1 and 2 years was 94 ± 2 %. Mean ( ± SD) cell-loss at 1 month , 3 months , 6 months , 12 months and 24 months: 30 ± 15 % , 29 ± 16 % , 33 ± 17 % , 35 ± 17 % and 48 ± 16 % , respectively. Compared to a prior series at our unit of 210 low-to-moderate risk DSEKs , cell loss was lower for DMEK at all time-points ( p < 0.001) through to 12 months but was not statistically different at 24 months. Mixed-modelling of ECD over time demonstrated the convergence of DMEK and DSEK curves by 2 years. DMEK using tissue from UK eye-banks resulted in high survival and excellent visual acuity. ECD through 1 year was superior to DSEK in a similar cohort. Our low re-bubble rate ( 2 %) may be attributable to use of intracameral air at temporarily elevated intraocular pressure.
