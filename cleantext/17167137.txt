  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death throughout the world. Despite new chemotherapeutic , immunomodulating and molecularly targeted agents , patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease still have a poor prognosis. This trial looked to combine antiangiogenic therapy with a first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy doublet , hoping to extend median progression-free survival ( PFS) while minimizing toxicity in patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). In this single institution , single-arm study , 51 patients ( age > 18 yo) were followed from 2007 to 2012. Patients with stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC and patients with recurrent unresectable disease ( nonradiation candidates) were eligible. Treatment consisted of carboplatin AUC 5 IV 30-60 minutes , pemetrexed 500/mg
