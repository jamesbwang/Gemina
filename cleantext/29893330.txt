  Breast cancer is a major cause of mortality in young women in the developing countries. Early diagnosis is the key to improve survival rate in cancer patients. In this paper an intelligent system is proposed to breast cancer tumor type recognition. The proposed system includes three main module: The feature selection module , the classifier module and the optimization module. Feature selection plays an important role in pattern recognition systems. The better selection of features usually results in higher accuracy rate. In the proposed system we used a new graph based feature selection approach to select the best features. In the classifier module , the radial basis function neural network ( RBFNN) is used as classifier. In RBF training , the number of RBFs and their respective centers and widths ( Spread) have very important role in its performance. Therefore , artificial bee colony ( ABC) algorithm is proposed for selecting appropriate parameters of the classifier. The RBFNN with optimal structure and the selected feature classified the tumors with 99.59 % accuracy. The proposed system is tested on Wisconsin breast cancer database ( WBCD) and the simulation results show that the recommended system exhibits a high accuracy. The proposed system has a high recognition accuracy and therefore we recommend the proposed system for breast cancer tumor type recognition.
