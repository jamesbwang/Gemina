  Idiopathic scoliosis ( IS) is a structural lateral spinal curvature of ≥ 10 that affects up to 3 % of otherwise healthy children and can lead to life-long problems in severe cases. It is well-established that IS is a genetic disorder. Previous studies have identified genes that may contribute to the IS phenotype , but the overall genetic etiology of IS is not well understood. We used exome sequencing to study five multigenerational families with IS. Bioinformatic analyses identified unique and low frequency variants ( minor allele frequency ≤ 5 %) that were present in all sequenced members of the family. Across the five families , we identified a total of 270 variants with predicted functional consequences in 246 genes , and found that eight genes were shared by two families. We performed GO term enrichment analyses , with the hypothesis that certain functional annotations or pathways would be enriched in the 246 genes identified in our IS families. Using three complementary programs to complete these analyses , we identified enriched categories that include stereocilia and other actin-based cellular projections , cilia and other microtubule-based cellular projections , and the extracellular matrix ( ECM). Our results suggest that there are multiple paths to IS and provide a foundation for future studies of IS pathogenesis.
