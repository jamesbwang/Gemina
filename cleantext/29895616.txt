  The spontaneous rhythmic action potentials generated by the sinoatrial node ( SAN<pathogen>) , the primary pacemaker in the heart , dictate the regular and optimal cardiac contractions that pump blood around the body. Although the heart rate of humans is substantially slower than that of smaller experimental animals , current perspectives on the biophysical mechanisms underlying the automaticity of sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells ( SANCs) have been gleaned largely from studies of animal hearts. Using human SANCs , we demonstrated that spontaneous rhythmic local Ca
