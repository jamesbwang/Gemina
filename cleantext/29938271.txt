  Escape of a granular chain from a pore in a wall in the presence of diffusing granular particles on one side of the wall is studied experimentally. The escape time shows power-law behavior as a function of the chain length ( τ ∝ Nα). A Langevin dynamics simulation of a polymer chain in a similar geometry is also performed and similar results to those for a granular system are obtained. A simple scaling argument and an energetic argument ( based on the Onsager principle) are introduced which explain our results very well. Experiments ( simulations) show that by increasing the number of particles on one side of the wall from zero , the exponent α decreases from 2.6 ± 0.1 ( 3.1 ± 0.1) to about 2. Both scaling and the Onsager principle argument predict α = 2 at high particle concentration , in agreement with the experiments and simulations. In the absence of particles , the scaling predicts τ = N2 .5 ( in agreement with the experimental result for the granular chain) and the Onsager principle predictsτ = N3 ln N , supporting the simulation result for the polymer chain. Experiments , simulations , scaling , and the Onsager principle confirm an inverse relation between τ and the density of particles on one side of the wall.
