  Evolution in computed tomography technology and image reconstruction have significantly changed practice. Dual energy computed tomography is being increasingly adopted owing to benefits of material separation , quantification , and improved contrast-to-noise ratio. The radiation dose can match that from single energy computed tomography. Spectral information derived from a polychromatic x-ray beam at different energies yields in image reconstructions that reduce the number of phases in a multiphasic examination and decrease the absolute amount of contrast media. This increased analytical and image processing capability provides new avenues for addressing radiation dose and iodine exposure concerns.
