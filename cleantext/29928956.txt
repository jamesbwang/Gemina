  The present study aimed to compare the ventricular enhancement time between humeral intraosseous access ( HIO) and brachial intravenous access ( BIV) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR) in adult humans. To our knowledge , this is the first such study during CPR in adult humans. This prospective single-centre observational cohort study assessed the medical records of patients who underwent CPR between January 2018 and March 2018. The primary endpoints were the left and right ventricular enhancement ( LVE and RVE , respectively) times after administration of a microbubble contrast agent via HIO or BIV. Continuous variables are reported as means and standard deviations depending on normal distribution , while categorical variables are reported as frequencies and percentages. The paired t-test and analysis of variance were used to compare HIO and BIV. Differences were considered significant at a P-value < 0.05. The study included 10 patients. The HIO time ( 15.60 ± 6.45 s) was significantly lower than the BIV time ( 20.80 ± 7.05 s; P = 0.009). The RVE time was significantly lower with HIO ( 5.60 ± 1.71 s) than with BIV ( 15.40 ± 3.24 s; P < 0.001). Additionally , the LVE time was significantly lower with HIO ( 120.20 ± 4.18 s) than with BIV ( 132.00 ± 3.09 s; P < 0.001). Our results indicated that the arrival times of a drug at the right and left ventricles are significantly lower with HIO than with BIV in an adult cardiac arrest model.
