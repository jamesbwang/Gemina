  The respiratory epithelium is a barrier against pathogens and allergens and a target for therapy in respiratory allergy , asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). We investigated barrier-damaging factors and protective factors by real-time measurement of respiratory cell barrier integrity. Barrier integrity to cigarette smoke extract ( CSE) , house dust mite ( HDM) extract , interferon-γ ( IFN-γ) or human rhinovirus<pathogen> ( HRV) infection alone or in combination was assessed. Corticosteroids , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) , and nasal mucus proteins were tested for their ability to prevent loss of barrier integrity. Real-time impedance-based measurement revealed different patterns of CSE- , HDM- , IFN-γ- and HRV-induced damage. When per se non-damaging concentrations of harmful factors were combined , a synergetic effect was observed only for CSE and HDM. Betamethasone prevented the damaging effect of HRV and CSE , but not damage caused by HDM or IFN-γ. Real-time impedance-based measurement of respiratory epithelial barrier function is useful to study factors , which are harmful or protective. The identification of a synergetic damaging effect of CSE and HDM as well as the finding that Betamethasone protects against HRV- and CSE-induced damage may be important for asthma and COPD.
