  Rotavirus<pathogen> infection has emerged as an important cause of complications in organ transplantation recipients and might play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD). 6-Thioguanine ( 6-TG) has been widely used as an immunosuppressive drug for organ recipients and treatment of IBD in the clinic. This study aims to investigate the effects and mode-of-action of 6-TG on rotavirus<pathogen> replication. Human intestinal Caco2 cell line , 3D model of human primary intestinal organoids , laboratory rotavirus<pathogen> strain ( SA11) and patient-derived rotavirus<pathogen> isolates were used. We have demonstrated that 6-TG significantly inhibits rotavirus<pathogen> replication in these intestinal epithelium models. Importantly , gene knockdown or knockout of Rac1 , the cellular target of 6-TG , significantly inhibited rotavirus<pathogen> replication , indicating the supportive role of Rac1 for rotavirus<pathogen> infection. We have further demonstrated that 6-TG can effectively inhibit the active form of Rac1 ( GTP-Rac1) , which essentially mediates the anti-rotavirus effect of 6-TG. Consistently , ectopic over-expression of GTP-Rac1 facilitates but an inactive Rac1 ( N17) or a specific Rac1 inhibitor ( NSC23766) inhibits rotavirus<pathogen> replication. In conclusion , we have identified 6-TG as an effective inhibitor of rotavirus<pathogen> replication via the inhibition of Rac1 activation. Thus , for transplantation patients or IBD patients infected with rotavirus<pathogen> or at risk of rotavirus<pathogen> infection , the choice of 6-TG as a treatment appears rational.
