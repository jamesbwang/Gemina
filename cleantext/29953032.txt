  The intense liver uptake of technetium-99-sestamibi ( Tc-MIBI) and photon scattering from the liver cause problems in quantitative perfusion interpretation. Hence , Tc-MIBI is a substrate for P-glycoprotein pump; variations in P-glycoprotein levels may affect liver clearance. Adult female Wistar rats were divided into seven main groups ( control and St. John 's Wort ( SJW) treated) and each SJW-treated group included three subgroups that were killed at 15 , 30 , and 45 min after Tc-MIBI injection. Treated groups received an SJW extract suspension at two doses of 100 and 400 mg/kg once daily for 5 , 10 , and 14 days , respectively. Tc-MIBI was injected intravenously to all rats 24 h after the final treatment. The rats were anesthetized at the mentioned time after tracer injection , and heart and liver tissues were removed , weighed , and their radioactivity was counted. One rat from each group was selected randomly for myocardial perfusion imaging. A significant increase in liver clearance and heart-to-liver ratio was observed in all SJW-treated groups compared with the control , especially at 10 days after SJW treatment. The heart radioactivity decreased in SJW-receiving groups at 14 days after SJW treatment. This study showed that SJW extract accelerates the liver clearance of Tc-MIBI and significantly reduces photon scattering from the liver.
