  Adherence of bacteria to teeth surface is considered an important step in the development of caries<disease> and the use of fissure sealants is crucial for the prevention of caries<disease> in occlusal surfaces of molars and premolars. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the adherence of The tested materials were Fissurit , Fissurit FX , Grandio Seal<disease> , Fuji Triage , Constic. Bacterial suspension was deposited onto each material and the adhesion was evaluated trough the colony forming units ( CFUs) determination with or without acidic drink exposure. The tested materials showed different behaviors with significant differences. Bacterial adherence values of the untreated materials were very dissimilar: Fuji Triage and Constic materials showed the better results ( Surface alteration after acidic drink exposure , changed the bacterial adhesion ( except for Grandio Seal<disease>): Fissurit , Fissurit FX and Fuji Triage decreased their susceptibility to be colonized by
