  Frontal meningioma is often asymptomatic and patient may present with psychiatric symptoms. We report a case of 45- year-old female patient with no premorbid medical illness presented with 6 months history of depressive symptoms and changes in personality. Her worsening cognitive impairment brought her to psychiatry clinic and led to further investigation with contrast-enhanced computed tomography ( CECT) Brain. The result showed well defined markedly enhancing lesion<symptom> in the frontal region measuring 5.5 cm X5 .2 cm X 4.4 cm with mass effect to the adjacent brain parenchyma and associated surrounding edema<symptom>. Diagnosis of bifrontal tumour-olfactory Groove Meningioma was made. Patient underwent bifrontal craniotomy and tumour excision. The quality of life improved after surgical excision.
