  Gallbladder duplication is a rare congenital disorder , which could cause an increasing risk of complications during surgery. The coexistence of cholangiocarcinoma with double gallbladder is extremely rare , which might lead to an even higher possibility of misdiagnosis and postsurgery complications. A 58-year-old female was presented with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and jaundice. Abdominal ultrasonography showed duplication of gallbladder , one of which with a thickened wall and a rough surface. This was also confirmed by an abdominal computed tomography ( CT) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP) scan. During the surgery , we found a tumor inside one bile duct. The postsurgery pathology showed adenosquamous carcinoma. Gallbladder duplication , cholangiocarcinoma. The tumor was removed by surgery. The patient died of tumor relapse six months after surgery. This is the first reported case with coexistence of gallbladder duplication and cholangiocarcinoma , which was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound , CT and MRCP , as well as further confirmed in surgery and pathology. This case emphasized the importance of a thorough examination of gallbladder before surgery , especially in those cases with suspected double gallbladder , since each gallbladder could have the possibility of an independent cholangiocarcinoma.
