  On-surface synthesis represents a successful strategy to obtain designed molecular structures on an ultra-clean metal substrate. While metal surfaces are known to favor adsorption , diffusion , and chemical bonding between molecular groups , on-surface synthesis on non-metallic substrates would allow the electrical decoupling of the resulting molecule from the surface , favoring application to electronics and spintronics. Here , we demonstrate the on-surface generation of hexacene by surface-assisted reduction on a H-passivated Si ( 001) surface. The reaction , observed by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy , is probably driven by the formation of Si-O complexes at dangling bond defects. Supported by density functional theory calculations , we investigate the interaction of hexacene with the passivated silicon surface , and with single silicon dangling bonds.
