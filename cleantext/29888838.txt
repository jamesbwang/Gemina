  CircRNAs exert gene regulatory effects by sequestering target microRNAs ( miRNAs) and play a vital role in the onset and development of disease. Until recently , little has been known about the expression , regulation and biological function of circRNAs in both health and chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( CHB). To identify hepatic circRNAs associated with CHB , we performed RNA sequencing using liver biopsies from untreated CHB patients and controls. We then established a bioinformatics pipeline for identification of CHB-associated circRNAs and in silico analysis of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA pathways. We used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) to confirm these results. The profiles of hepatic circRNA expression were significantly different in CHB compared with controls , with a total of 99 dysregulated circRNAs identified to be correlated with CHB. Computational analysis of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA pathways revealed a large number of miRNAs ( 665) , which were putatively targeted by the differentially expressed hepatic circRNAs. Interestingly , four of the predicted CHB-related circRNA-miRNA-mRNA pathways were found to be involved in the pathogenesis of HBV infection and progression of HBV-associated liver disease. Among these pathways , regression analysis of gene expression revealed a strong positive correlation between hsa_circ_0000650 and TGFβ2 and a negative correlation between hsa_circ_0000650 and miR-6873-3p , which hinted that hsa_circ_0000650 interacted with TGFβ2 mediated by miR-6873-3p. This study firstly demonstrates that patients with CHB present different profiles of hepatic circRNAs and circRNA/miRNA interactions. Thus , circRNAs have promise as novel mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and progression of CHB.
