  Maximum standard uptake value ( SUVmax) of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography ( FDG-PET/CT) is reportedly useful for evaluating regional lymph nodes ( RLNs) of non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) to predict malignancy. However , it is difficult for clinicians to measure SUVmax ( mSUVmax) as calculated by a workstation.We assessed the utility of simplified SUVmax ( sSUVmax) in screening RLNs for pathologic malignancy. The highest color was visually defined in the region of interest. The resulting color can be quantified using the color bar , and interpreted as sSUVmax. Patients in respiratory medicine and surgery who underwent both contrast-enhanced CT and FDG-PET/CT within 3 months before radical lobectomy were evaluated retrospectively. The correlation was examined by regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analyses.Participants comprised 69 patients with NSCLC treated between May 2009 and April 2016. Medical group comprised 22 patients from respiratory medicine. The prediction model could be written as a linear relationship ( mSUVmax = 1.019 Ã— sSUVmax; R = 0.930). A total of 316 RLNs resected by surgery in total cohort were pathologically determined. From ROC curves , area under curve for sSUVmax was 0.72 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.61-0.83; P < .0002). The cutoff sSUVmax was 2.42 ( sensitivity , 52 %; specificity , 88 %; accuracy , 85 %). The sSUVmax allows quantification of colors from FDG-PET/CT and shows a close correlation to mSUVmax. This value may have potential in screening for RLNs , and thoracic clinicians can readily determine the value. These findings may facilitate better planning of therapeutic strategy in the real world.
