  <bibitemÂ lang="en"> The anti-influenza virus drug oseltamivir has been reported to have several pharmacological actions including blocking of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor channels and activation of the dopaminergic system. These pharmacological actions highly overlap those of amantadine , another anti-influenza virus drug authorized in Japan , and ester-type local anesthetics. Moreover , oseltamivir and amantadine can clinically induce similar adverse neuropsychiatric reactions. In the present study , from the database of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ( PMDA) , we surveyed 2,576 drugs for which neuropsychiatric side effects similar to those of oseltamivir , amantadine and local anesthetics ( abnormal<symptom> behavior<symptom> , confusion<symptom> , consciousness<symptom> disturbance , convulsion<symptom> , delirium<symptom> , delusion , hallucination , myoclonus , tremor<symptom>) are listed as `` clinically significant adverse reactions '' , and found 327 that had at least one of these adverse reactions. Other neuraminidase inhibitors ( laninamivir , peramivir and zanamivir) did not elicit such adverse reactions. By discussing the pharmacological effects of drugs that elicit these adverse reactions , we propose that the similarity of adverse neuropsychiatric reactions between oseltamivir and amantadine is possibly attributable to their common pharmacological effects.
