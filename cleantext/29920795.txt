  Highly active , stable , and cheap Pt-free catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) are facing increasing demand as a result of their potential use in future energy-conversion systems. However , the development of HER electrocatalysts with Pt-like or even superior activity , in particular ones that can function under alkaline conditions , remains a significant challenge. Here , the synthesis of a novel carbon-loaded ruthenium nanoparticle electrocatalyst ( Ru@CQDs) for the HER , using carbon quantum dots ( CQDs) , is reported. Electrochemical tests reveal that , even under extremely alkaline conditions ( 1 m KOH) , the as-formed Ru@CQDs exhibits excellent catalytic behavior with an onset overpotential of 0 mV , a Tafel slope of 47 mV decade
