  Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is a multi-factorial neurodegenerative disorder with abnormal accumulation of amyloid-β ( Aβ) plaques , neuroinflammation and impaired neurogenesis. Mounting evidences suggest that single-target drugs have limited effects on clinical treatment and alternative or multiple targets are required. In recent decades , natural compounds and their derivatives have gained increasing attention in AD drug discovery due to their inherently enormous chemical and structural diversity. In this study , we demonstrated that naringin dihydrochalcone ( NDC) , a widely used dietary sweetener with strong antioxidant activity , improved the cognitive function of transgenic AD mice. Pathologically , NDC attenuated Aβ deposition in AD mouse brain. Furthermore , NDC reduced periplaque activated microglia and astrocytes , indicating the inhibition of neuroinflammation. It also enhanced neurogenesis as investigated by BrdU/NeuN double labeling. Additionally , the inhibition of Aβ level and neuroinflammation by NDC treatment was also observed in an AD cell model or a microglia cell line. Taken together , our study indicated that NDC might be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD against multiple targets that include Aβ pathology , neuroinflammation and neurogenesis.
