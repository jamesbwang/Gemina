  This study examined the temporal relation between self-competence ( academic , social , athletic , physical appearance , and close friend) and depressive symptoms in a large , diverse community sample of 636 adolescents. Surveys were administered to all 10th- and 11th-grade students at participating high schools at baseline ( mean age = 16.10 , SD = .71) and 1 year later. Girls reported higher levels of self-competence in close friendships and more depressive symptoms , whereas boys reported higher levels of self-competence in athletics and physical appearance. However , there were no gender differences in the associations between self-competence and depressive symptoms. Results from autoregressive , cross-lagged path analyses indicated that depressive symptoms predicted self-competence more consistently than self-competence predicted depressive symptoms during middle-late adolescence. Implications for prevention are discussed.
