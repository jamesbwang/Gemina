  Genomic data from various organisms have been used to study how sexual selection has shaped genetic diversity in reproductive proteins , and in particular , to elucidate how mating systems may have influenced evolution at the molecular and phenotypic levels. However , large-scale proteomic data including protein identifications and abundances are only now entering the field of evolutionary and comparative genomics. Variation in both protein sequence and expression level may play important roles in the evolution of sexual traits and behaviors. Here , we broadly analyze the components of seminal fluid from primates with diverse mating systems ranging from monogamous to polygynous , and include genomics , proteomics , phylogenetic and quantitative characters into our framework. Our analyses show that seminal fluid proteins are undergoing rapid evolution and some of these quickly evolving proteins may be influenced by sexual selection. Through evolutionary analyses and protein abundance differences , we identified 84 genes whose evolutionary rates or expression levels were correlated with mating system and other sexual characters. We found that many proteins differ in abundance between monogamous and polygynous primate mating systems. Many of these proteins are enriched in the copulatory plug pathway , which suggests that post-zygotic selective barriers are important regardless of mating system type. This work is the first to comprehensively compare seminal fluid proteins between human and non-human primates using high-throughput proteomics. Our findings highlight the impact of mating system variation on seminal fluid protein evolution and abundance.
