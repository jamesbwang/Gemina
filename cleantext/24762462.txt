  There is a lack of data regarding hyperkalemia after liver transplantation. To evaluate the prevalence of hyperkalemia after liver transplantation and its associated factors. This retrospective cohort study evaluated 147 consecutive post-transplant patients who had at least one year of outpatient medical follow up. The data collection included gender , age , potassium values , urea , creatinine , sodium and medication use at 1 , 6 and 12 months after. Hyperkalemia was defined as serum potassium concentrations higher than 5.5 mEq/l. Hiperkalemia was observed in 18.4 % , 17.0 % and 6.1 % of patients 1 , 6 and 12 months after tranplantation , respectively. Older age ( p = 0.021) , low creatinine clearance ( p = 0.007) , increased urea ( p = 0.010) and hypernatremia ( p = 0.014) were factors associated with hyperkalemia , as well as the dose of prednisone at six months ( p = 0.014). Hyperkalemia was prevalent in less than 20 % of patients in the 1st month after liver transplantation and decreased over time. Considering that hyperkalemia does not affect all patients , attention should be paid to the routine potassium intake recommendations , and treatment should be individualized.
