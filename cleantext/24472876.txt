  None A cluster randomized controlled trial ( RCT) will be conducted including 428 high-school students aged 18-14 years in two regions of Chile. Study procedures will take place as follows: ( 1) design of the intervention model and creation of prototype; ( 2) selection and randomization of the participating public schools; ( 3) implementation of the 3-month intervention and evaluation at baseline , post-intervention period , and a 2-month follow-up. Suicidal ideation at the 2-month follow up is the primary outcome in this study. Secondary outcomes include negative psychological outcomes ( e.g. , stigma , depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom>) as well as a number of protective psychological and social factors. Indicators regarding the study implementation will be also gathered. Here we describe a novel program based on technological devices and aimed to target youth suicide in Chile. This is the first clinical trial of such a program in Latin America , and to our knowledge , the first of its kind in any middle income country.
