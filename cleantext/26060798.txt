  Both white matter hyperintensities ( WMHs) and lacunar infarctions ( LIs) are magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) markers of cerebral small vessel disease ( SVD). However , the association between WMH and LI remains unclear. In this study , we asked whether WMH progression is related to LI occurrence using retrospective data. Overall , 8475 WMH patients with at least two MRI images were screened , and 187 patients were included in the final study; 76 patients had WMH with LI ( WL) , and 111 patients had WMH without LI ( WOL). The 187 patients were divided into three groups according to WMH progression: Group 1 ( no progression) , Group 2 ( 0-53.64 % WMH progression) and Group 3 ( â‰¥ 53.64 % WMH progression). We found that both WMH volumes and Fazekas scores were higher in WL patients compared with those in WOL patients according to the 1
