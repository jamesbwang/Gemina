  The use of ` marginal ' hearts , such as from donors with diabetes mellitus ( DM) , could offer an opportunity to expand the donor pool in cardiac transplantation. Previous studies have shown that the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K)/ Akt pathway is altered after ischaemia/reperfusion injury in the diabetic myocardium. We hypothesized that DM-induced cardiac dysfunction in donors is further impaired after heart transplantation and that PI3K/Akt-pathway alterations may be one of the underlying pathomechanisms. In the donor rats , DM was induced with a single dose of streptozotocin. Non-diabetic rats only received citrate buffer. After 8 weeks , the donor left ventricular ( LV) cardiac function was measured. Then , the hearts were heterotopically transplanted into non-diabetic recipients. We evaluated LV graft function 1.5 h after transplantation via a Millar catheter system at different LV volumes. Histological analyses were performed , and the expression of 84 genes involved in PI3K/Akt signalling was profiled. DM was associated with significantly decreased LV contractility and impaired relaxation. After transplantation , in the DM group , the grafts ' systolic function ( LV systolic pressure 112 ± 31 vs 155 ± 60 mmHg; dP/dtmax 2676 ± 896 vs 3584 ± 1779 mmHg/s , P < 0.05) and diastolic function ( dP/dtmin 924 ± 205 vs 1748 ± 512 mmHg/s , P < 0.05) were significantly reduced at an intraventricular volume of 170 µl. The expression of 10 genes involved in PI3K/Akt signalling , as well as the phosphorylated Akt/total Akt protein expression ratio , were significantly down-regulated in the diabetic heart after transplantation. DM-induced cardiac dysfunction is further impaired after transplantation. Targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway may result in a functional amelioration of the a priori-diseased myocardia , which could increase the number of potential cardiac donors.
