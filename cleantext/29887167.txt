  Biologic drugs are usually prescribed as second-line treatment for psoriasis , that is , after the patient has first been treated with a conventional psoriasis drug. There are , however , cases where , depending on the characteristics of the patient or the judgement of the physician , biologics may be chosen as first-line therapy. No studies to date have analyzed the demographics or clinical characteristics of patients in this setting or the safety profile of the agents used. The main aim of this study was to characterize these aspects of first-line biologic therapy and compare them to those observed for patients receiving biologics as second-line therapy. We conducted an observational study of 181 patients treated in various centers with a systemic biologic drug as first-line treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis between January 2008 and November 2016. All the patients were registered in the Spanish Registry of Adverse Events Associated with Biologic Drugs in Dermatology. The characteristics of the first- and second-line groups were very similar , although the patients receiving a biologic as first-line treatment for their psoriasis were older. No differences were observed for disease severity ( assessed using the PASI) or time to diagnosis. Hypertension , diabetes , and liver disease were all more common in the first-line group. There were no differences between the groups in terms of reasons for drug withdrawal or occurrence of adverse effects. No major differences were found between patients with psoriasis receiving biologic drugs as first- or second-line therapy , a finding that provides further evidence of the safety of biologic therapy in patients with psoriasis.
