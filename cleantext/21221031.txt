  Despite being widely used , ventriculoperitoneal ( VP) shunt placement is a procedure often associated with complications and revision surgeries. Many neurosurgical centers routinely perform early postoperative cranial computer tomography ( CT) to detect postoperative complications ( e.g. , catheter malposition , postoperative bleed , over-drainage). Because guidelines are lacking , our study aimed to evaluate the yield of early routine postoperative CT after shunt placement for adult hydrocephalus<symptom>. We retrospectively reviewed 173 patients who underwent frontal VP shunting for various neurosurgical conditions. Radiological outcomes were proximal catheter malposition , and ventricular width in preoperative and postoperative imaging. Clinical outcomes included postoperative neurological outcome , revision surgery because of catheter malposition or other causes , mortality , and finally surgical , non-surgical , and overall morbidity. In only 3 ( 1.7 %) patients did the early routine postoperative CT lead to revision surgery. Diagnostic ratios for CT finding 1 asymptomatic patient who eventually underwent revision surgery per total number to scan were 1:58 for shunt malposition , 1:86 for hygroma , and 1:173 for a cranial bleed. Five ( 2.9 %) patients with clinically asymptomatic shunt malposition or hygroma underwent intervention based on early postoperative CT ( diagnostic ratio 1:25). Shunt malposition occurred in no patient with normal pressure hydrocephalus<symptom> and 2 ( 40 %) patients with stroke. Lower preoperative Evans ' Index was a statistically significant predictor for high-grade shunt malposition. We found a rather low yield for early routine postoperative cranial CT after frontal VP-shunt placement. Therefore , careful selection of patients who might benefit , considering the underlying disease and preoperative radiological findings , could reduce unnecessary costs and exposure to radiation.
