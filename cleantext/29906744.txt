  MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) contribute to tumorigenesis and progression via acting as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in human cancer. Aberrant expression of miR-302c has been reported in various types of cancer except colorectal cancer ( CRC). Thus , our study was aimed to verify the expression of miR-302c and its functional role in CRC. We found a significant reduced expression of miR-302c in CRC tissues compared to tumor-adjacent tissues. Low miR-302c level was remarkably correlated with deeper tumor invasion , lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stage. Importantly , low miR-302c expression was identified as an independent indicator for poor prognosis of CRC patients. Overexpression of miR-302c repressed migration and invasion capacities of SW620 and SW480 cells in vitro. Mechanistically , miR-302c inversely regulated transcription factor AP4 ( TFAP4) abundance in both SW620 and SW480 cells , and it negatively correlated with TFAP4 mRNA expression in CRC samples. Herein , TFAP4 , a regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) , was recognized as a direct target gene of miR-302c in CRC. Otherwise , miR-302c overexpression increased E-cadherin expression and reduced the levels of Vimentin and SNAI1 , suggesting an inhibitory effect of miR-302c on EMT of CRC cells. Notably , our findings established that the EMT and metastasis of Caco-2 cells were enhanced by miR-302c knockdown , and subsequently reversed by TFAP4 silencing. Collectively , these data indicate that miR-302c represses EMT and CRC metastasis possibly by targeting TFAP4 , and it may serve as a potential prognostic factor and therapeutic target for CRC.
