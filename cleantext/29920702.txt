  The utility of exercise-induced ST-segment depression<symptom> for diagnosing ischemic heart disease ( IHD) in women is unclear. Based on evidence that IHD pathophysiology in women involves coronary vascular dysfunction , we hypothesized that coronary vascular dysfunction contributes to exercise electrocardiography ( Ex-ECG) ST-depression in the absence of obstructive CAD , so-called `` false positive '' results. We tested our hypothesis in a pilot study evaluating the relationship between peripheral vascular endothelial function and Ex-ECG. Twenty-nine asymptomatic women without cardiac risk factors underwent maximal Bruce protocol exercise treadmill testing and peripheral endothelial function assessment using peripheral arterial tonometry ( Itamar EndoPAT 2000) to measure reactive hyperemia<symptom> index ( RHI). The relationship between RHI and Ex-ECG ST-segment depression<symptom> was evaluated using logistic regression and differences in subgroups using two-tailed t-tests. Mean age was 54 ± 7 years , body mass index 25 ± 4 kg/m Our pilot study demonstrates a high prevalence of exercise-induced ST-segment depression<symptom> in asymptomatic , middle-aged , overweight women. Peripheral vascular endothelial dysfunction did not predict Ex-ECG ST-segment depression<symptom> Further work is needed to investigate the utility of vascular endothelial testing and Ex-ECG for IHD diagnostic and management purposes in women.
