  Tens of millions of rural `` left-behind children ( LBC) '' in China grow up experiencing prolonged separation from their migrant worker parents. This study aimed to explore how children are affected by parental migration , from the perspectives of children , parents , and grandparents , focusing on the experiences of prolonged parent-child separation and relationship dynamics in the extended family. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted in a migrant-sending rural area of eastern China. Participants included 25 children ( aged 7 to 14) , 17 parents , and 13 grandparents , from 30 families , as well as 24 key informants from the communities. Data analysis followed a grounded theory approach. The results showed that despite the original purpose of benefiting children , parental migration resulted in challenges in child psychosocial well-being , due to the emotional impacts from prolonged parent-child separation. Parental absence also led to inadequate care and support for left-behind children. The negative effects of parental migration may be exacerbated by other vulnerabilities such as parents ' divorce , poverty and grandparent caregivers ' frailty. Concerns about child well-being made some migrants decide to return home permanently , because of the altered trade-offs of migration. Prolonged separation following migration often disrupts parent-child relationships and results in psychosocial difficulties in LBC , especially among those who live with multiple adversities in the family. Community-based interventions may help migrant parents and co-resident caregivers to better engage children and promote their resilience.
