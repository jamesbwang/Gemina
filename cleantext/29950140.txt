  Impairment of antioxidant defense system and increase in metabolic rate and production of reactive oxygen species have been demonstrated in strenuous exercise. Both at rest and during contractile activity , skeletal muscle generates a very complex set of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species; the main generated are superoxide and nitric oxide. The nature of the contractile activity influences the pattern and the magnitude of this reactive oxygen and nitrogen species ( ROS) generation. The intracellular pro-oxidant/antioxidant homeostasis undergoes alteration owing to strenuous exercise and the major identified sources of intracellular free radical generation during physical activity are the mitochondrial electron transport chain , polymorphoneutrophil , and xanthine oxidase. Reactive oxygen species increased tissue susceptibility to oxidative damage and pose a serious threat to the cellular antioxidant defense system. The possible dangerous consequences of the aging process and human wellness are emphasized in this review.
