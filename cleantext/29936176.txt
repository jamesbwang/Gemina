  The underlying work was conducted aiming at cancer targeted therapy using the sono-photodynamic therapy ( SPDT) in combination with sonnelux ( SLux) as a sono-photosensitizer loaded on folic acid conjugated nanographene oxide nanoparticles ( FA-NGO-SLux) as an up-to-date treating cancer modality. Study was conducted on A total of 130 male Swiss albino mice with age 60-65 day , weighing 20 Â± 25 g , inoculated with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma ( EAC) subdivided into 13 group. Two sources of energy were used; namely infrared laser and Ultrasound ( pulsed and continuous wave mode). Results revealed that Nano-SLux is a potential photosensitizer and sonosensitizer for photodynamic or sonodynamic treatment of Ehrlich ascites tumor tissue. Nano-SLux can play important roles in inhibiting tumor growth and even inducing cell death , which might be attributed to Photo and/or sono-chemical activation mechanism. Infra-red laser in combination with ultrasound in the presence of Nano - SLux has a potential antitumor effect. Sonocation followed by light photon irradiation proves its excellent efficiency as an anticancer therapy. The results suggest that folic acid-conjugated nano-graphene oxide loaded with sono-photo-sensitizers ( FA-NGO-SPSs) could be used as a novel nanomaterial with great potential as effective drug delivery system in targeting sono-photo-dynamic-therapy ( SPDT).
