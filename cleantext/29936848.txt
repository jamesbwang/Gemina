  Interfacing DNA with liposomes has produced a diverse range of programmable soft materials , devices , and drug delivery vehicles. By simply controlling liposomal composition , bilayer fluidity , lipid domain formation , and surface charge can be systematically varied. Recent development in DNA research has produced not only sophisticated nanostructures but also new functions including ligand binding and catalysis. For noncationic liposomes , a DNA is typically covalently linked to a hydrophobic or lipid moiety that can be inserted into lipid membranes<symptom>. In this article , we discuss fundamental biointerfaces formed between DNA and noncationic liposomes. The methods to prepare such conjugates and the interactions at the membrane interfaces are also discussed. The effect of DNA lateral diffusion on fluid bilayer membranes<symptom> and the effect of membrane on DNA assembly are emphasized. DNA hybridization can be programmed to promote fusion of lipid membranes<symptom>. Representative applications of this conjugate for drug delivery , biosensor development , and directed assembly of materials are briefly described toward the end. Some future research directions are also proposed to further understand this biointerface.
