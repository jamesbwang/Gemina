  Microbes can engage in social interactions ranging from cooperation to warfare. Biofilms are structured , cooperative microbial communities. Like all cooperative communities , they are susceptible to invasion by selfish individuals who benefit without contributing. However , biofilms are pervasive and ancient , representing the first fossilized life. One hypothesis for the stability of biofilms is spatial structure: Segregated patches of related cooperative cells are able to outcompete unrelated cells. These dynamics have been explored computationally and in bacteria; however , their relevance to eukaryotic microbes remains an open question. The complexity of eukaryotic cell signaling and communication suggests the possibility of different social dynamics. Using the tractable model yeast ,
