  The breeding of new soft-seeded pomegranate cultivars provides new products for the market and increases farmers ' incomes , yet the genetic architecture mediating seed hardness is largely unknown. Here , the seed hardness and hundred-seed weights of 26 cultivars were determined in 2 successive years. We conducted miRNA and mRNA sequencing to analyse the seeds of two varieties of Punica granatum: soft-seeded Tunisia and hard-seeded Sanbai , at 60 and 120 d after flowering. Seed hardness was strongly positively correlated with hundred-seed weight. We detected 25 and 12 differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA pairs with negative regulatory relationships between the two genotypes at 60 and 120 d after flowering , respectively. These miRNA-mRNA pairs mainly regulated seed hardness by altering cell wall structure. Transcription factors including NAC1 , WRKY and MYC , which are involved in seed hardness , were targeted by differentially expressed mdm-miR164e and mdm-miR172b. Thus , seed hardness is the result of a complex biological process regulated by a miRNA-mRNA network in pomegranate. These results will help us understand the complexity of seed hardness and help to elucidate the miRNA-mediated molecular mechanisms that contribute to seed hardness in pomegranate.
