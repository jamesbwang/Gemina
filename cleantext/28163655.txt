  This paper evaluates self-tracking practices in connection with ideas of objectivity via exploration of confrontations with personal data , particularly with reference to physiological stress and recovery measurements. The discussion departs from the notion of ` mechanical objectivity ' , seeking to obtain evidence that is ` uncontaminated by interpretation '. The framework of mechanical objectivity tends , however , to fall short when people translate physiological measurements to fit their expectations and everyday experiences. We develop the concept of ` situated objectivity ' with the goal of highlighting the everyday as a domain of interpretation , reflection and ambiguity , proposing that the concept offers an analytical entry point to a more profound understanding of how people engage with their personal data. Everyday data encounters are not methodical and systematic , but combine knowledge in an eclectic manner. Framed in this way , self-tracking practices are less occupied with ` facts of life ' than translating and transforming life based on earlier experiences , cultural understandings and shared expectations. Paradoxically , new measurement devices and software , which are supposed to be based on sound<symptom> , universal and generalisable principles , hard facts and accurate descriptions , become raw material for daily decisions , as people seek bespoke answers and craft personalised theories of health and life. From this perspective , self-tracking measurements can be used to experiment and learn , gaining value in relation to the communicative processes that they promote and contributing to possibilities for rethinking health knowledge and health promotion.
