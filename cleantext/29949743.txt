  We previously demonstrated that the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent meloxicam has neuroprotective effects in an oxygen and glucose deprivation model ( OGD) of rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. We wondered if GABAergic transmission changed the neuroprotective effects of meloxicam and if meloxicam was able to modulate endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ER stress) in this model. Mortality was measured using propidium iodide. Western blot assays were performed to measure levels of cleaved and non-cleaved caspase-3 to quantify apoptosis , while levels of GRP78 , GRP94 and phosphorylated eIF2α were used to detect unfolded protein response ( UPR). Transcript levels of GRP78 , GRP94 and GABAergic receptor α , β , and γ subunits were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR). In the present study , we show that the presence of meloxicam in a 30 min OGD assay , followed by 24 h of normoxic conditions , presented an antiapoptotic effect. The simultaneous presence of the GABA
