  The African baobab is the biggest and longest-living angiosperm tree. By using radiocarbon dating we identified the stable architectures that enable baobabs to reach large sizes and great ages. We report that 9 of the 13 oldest and 5 of the 6 largest individuals have died , or at least their oldest parts/stems have collapsed and died , over the past 12 years; the cause of the mortalities is still unclear.
