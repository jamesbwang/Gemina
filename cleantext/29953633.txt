  Microalgae have emerged as promising biosorbents for the treatment of malachite green in wastewater. However , the underlying mechanism for the biosorption of malachite green onto microalgae is still unclear and needs further intensive study. In this work , synchrotron Fourier-transform infrared ( synchrotron-FTIR) microspectroscoy in combination with biochemical assay is employed to evaluate malachite green removal efficiency ( 95.2 % , 75.6 % and 66.5 %) by three stages of Haematococcus pluvialis. Meanwhile , the various vital changes of algal cells including lipids , proteins , polysaccharides and carotenoids , is distinguished and quantified in situ. This study illustrates that synchrotron-FTIR microspectroscopy is an effective and powerful tool to scrutinize the mechanism for the interactions between the malachite green dye and microalgal cells and it even provides an effective and none-invasive new approach to screen potentially proper biosorbents for the removal of dyes from wastewater.
