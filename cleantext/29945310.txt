  Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>) is a versatile pathogen found in many environments and can cause nosocomial infections in the community and hospitals. S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> infection is an increasingly serious threat to global public health that requires action across many government bodies , medical and health sectors , and scientific research institutions. In the present study , S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> N315 genes that have been shown in the literature to be pathogenic were extracted using a bibliometric method for functional enrichment analysis of pathways and operons to statistically discover novel pathogenic genes associated with S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> N315. A total of 383 pathogenic genes were mined from the literature using bibliometrics , and subsequently a few new pathogenic genes of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> N315 were identified by functional enrichment analysis of pathways and operons. The discovery of these novel S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> N315 pathogenic genes is of great significance to treat S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> induced diseases and identify potential diagnostic markers , thus providing theoretical fundamentals for epidemiological prevention.
