  The trans femoral osteotomy was initially described by Wagner in 1987 and the extended trochanteric osteotomy ( ETO) was described by Younger et al. in 1995 and is considered to be the gold standard technique for removal of well-fixed femoral stems in revision total hip arthroplasty ( THA). The purpose of this report is: to compare the different types of fixation metallic wires , cables , metallic reinforcement plate ( MRP) we have used in revision THA where an ETO was performed; analyse the clinical and radiological outcomes of these devices at 1 year; analyse the complication. It is a retrospective continuous monocentric series of 157 patients where an ETO was performed. It was fixed by an MRP in 17 patients , cables in 43 , metallic wires in 97. The main outcome was the consolidation of the osteotomized femoral flap ( OFF). Secondary outcomes were Postel Merle d'Aubigne score and complications occurred at 1 year follow up. Qualitative variable was presented as percentage , quantitative variables as mean or median , standard deviation and range. 157 patients ( 73-46 , 5 % females) were included. Mean age at surgery was 66.7 year ( sd = 10.63). Mean interval between index surgery and revision was 11.07 year ( sd = 5.67). Causes for revision and bone defects were comparable. At 1 year OFF is healed without displacement in 82 % with metallic wires , 70 % with cables , 88 % with MRP. Not significant. Fixation of the femoral flap is a technical issue in ETO. Metallic wires and cables are the most commonly used to secure the fixation. Fixation with a metallic plate is reported in a few number of articles and may be helpful specially when a fracture of the OFF occurred during surgery.
