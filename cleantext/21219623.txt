  Salivary melatonin levels have been analyzed in many research fields , including physiological anthropology. Although various devices have been utilized for saliva collection , cotton swabs are among the most common. However , previous studies have reported that cotton swabs may interfere with melatonin assay results , whereas synthetic swabs may not. These studies compared only mean melatonin levels between passive and synthetic-polymer swab collection methods but did not evaluate relative and proportional biases. Our study examines the effects of using swabs made of materials other than cotton , such as polypropylene-polyethylene polymer , on salivary melatonin assay results using a Bland-Altman ( BA) plot. The effects of the saliva collection method were analyzed using two concentrations of melatonin , lower ( < 6 pg/ml) and higher ( > 6 pg/ml) , because the threshold of dim light melatonin onset was lower than 6 pg/ml in many studies. Differences detected between passive and polypropylene-polyethylene polymer swab methods of saliva collection were not significant in both lower ( < 6 pg/ml) and higher ( > 6 pg/ml) melatonin levels detected. All correlations between the collection methods were significant , and 95 % confidence intervals for differences in melatonin levels in all samples detected using passive and non-cotton swab saliva collection methods included zero in the BA plots. Averages and differences between non-cotton and passive saliva collection obtained from the BA plots were not significantly correlated at lower and higher melatonin levels. Our findings demonstrate that swabbing methods , including the use of polypropylene-polyethylene polymer , do not affect salivary melatonin assay results. Therefore , the authors suggest that polypropylene-polyethylene polymer swab methods are appropriate for the assessment of dim light melatonin onset and dose response of the circadian system to light.
