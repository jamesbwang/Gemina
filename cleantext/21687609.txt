  The aim of this work was to establish a process for the heterotrophic growth of green microalgae using forest<pathogen> biomass hydrolysates. To provide a carbon source for the growth of the green microalgae , two forest<pathogen> biomasses ( Norway spruce and silver birch) were pretreated with a hybrid organosolv-steam explosion method , resulting in inhibitor-free pretreated solids with a high cellulose content of 77.9 % w/w ( birch) and 72 % w/w ( spruce). Pretreated solids were hydrolyzed using commercial cellulolytic enzymes to produce hydrolysate for the culture of algae.<pathogen> The heterotrophic growth of To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of using organosolv pretreated wood biomass hydrolysates for the growth and lipid production of microalgae in the literature. The pretreatment process used in this study provided high saccharification of biomass without the presence of inhibitors. Moreover , the lipid profile of this microalga showed similar contents to vegetable oils which improve the biodiesel properties.
