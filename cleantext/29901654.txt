  Although existing data suggest marked variability in interhospital transfer ( IHT) , little is known about specific factors that may impact the quality and safety of this care transition. We aimed to explore transferred patients ' and involved physicians ' experience with IHT to better understand the components of the transfer continuum and identify potential targets for improvement. We performed a qualitative study using individual interviews of adult patients recently transferred to cardiology , general medicine , and oncology services at a tertiary care academic medical center , as well as their transferring physician , accepting attending physician , and accepting/admitting resident physician. We conducted a thematic analysis , using an inductive approach and an a priori framework from pre-established domains. Participants included 10 hospitalized adults ( 6 cardiology , 2 general medicine , and 2 oncology) , 9 accepting attending physicians , 12 accepting and/or admitting resident physicians , and 5 transferring physicians ( N = 36). Emergent themes demonstrated that participants held a shared understanding of the reason for transfer ( most commonly access to more specialized care) , and relayed a general dissatisfaction regarding the timing and lack of advanced notification of transfer. We also found distinct differences in IHT experience by stakeholder group: physician participants relayed discontent with intrahospital chains of communication and interhospital information exchange , and patient participants focused more readily on the physical aspects of IHT. This study offers insight into IHT from the perspective of those most affected by this process , thereby identifying potential targets in addressing the quality and safety of this transition.
