  Namenamicin is a rare natural product possessing potent cytotoxic properties that may prove useful as a lead compound for payloads of antibody-drug conjugates ( ADCs). Its scarcity , coupled with the uncertainty of its full absolute configuration , elevates it to an attractive synthetic target. Herein we describe the total synthesis of the two C7 '- epimers of namenamicin and assign its complete structure , opening the way for further chemical and biological studies toward the discovery of potent payloads for ADCs directed toward targeted cancer therapies.
