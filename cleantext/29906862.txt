  A direct observation of the stratified electrothermal instability on the surface of thick metal is reported. Aluminum rods coated with 70μm Parylene-N were driven to 1 MA in 100ns , with the metal thicker than the skin depth. The dielectric coating suppressed plasma formation , enabling persistent observation of discrete azimuthally correlated stratified thermal perturbations perpendicular to the current whose wave numbers , k , grew exponentially with rate γ ( k) = 0.06 ns ^ ( -1)- ( 0.4 ns ^ ( -1) μm ^ ( 2) rad ^ ( -2)) k ^ ( 2) in ∼ 1g/cm ^ ( 3) , ∼ 7000K aluminum.
