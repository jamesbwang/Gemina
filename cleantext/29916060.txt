  Previous research shows that larger interference is observed in contexts associated with a high proportion of congruent trials than in those associated with a low proportion of congruent trials. Given that one of the most relevant contexts for human beings is social context , researchers have recently explored the possibility that social stimuli could also work as contextual cues for the allocation of attentional control. In fact , it has been shown that individuals use social categories ( i.e. , men and women) as cues to allocate attentional control. In this work , we go further by showing that individual faces ( instead of the social categories they belong to) associated with a high proportion of congruent trials can also lead to larger interference effects compared to individual faces predicting a relatively low proportion of congruent trials. Furthermore , we show that faces associated with a high proportion of congruent trials are more positively evaluated than faces associated with a high proportion of incongruent trials. These results demonstrate that unique human faces are potential contextual cues than can be employed to apply cognitive control when performing an automatic task.
