  Critical aortic stenosis ( AS) is an unusual cardiac pathology in pregnancy , but has significant impact on the fetal and maternal outcomes of pregnancy. Pregnant patients with aortic stenosis and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> represent a major challenge for the heart team and anesthesiologist who should balance the risks and benefits of different treatment strategies and their effects on the mother and fetus. We present a 26-year-old parturient who underwent cesarean section at 30 weeks of gestation under general anesthesia in the presence of cardiac surgical team followed by deferred aortic valve replacement after two weeks. This report describes the importance of multidisciplinary preoperative evaluation , and careful surgical and anesthetic planning to avoid the deterioration of perioperative cardiac condition in such patients.
