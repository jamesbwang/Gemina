  The aim of the study was to investigate the frequency and characteristics of peripheral nervous system ( PNS) and central nervous system ( CNS) involvement in COPD. The study included 41 COPD patients and 41 healthy volunteers. Electrophysiological studies were carried out: electromyography ( EMG) and visual evoked potentials ( VEPs). The median nerve , ulnar nerve , common peroneal nerve , and tibial nerve were evaluated for latency , amplitude , and conduction velocity. The mean age of patients with COPD was 61.8 years and disease duration 10.3 years. There was no difference between patient and control groups in terms of age , BMI , smoking status , or biochemical parameters. Upon VEP examination , latencies were significantly prolonged and amplitudes shortened in the patient group compared to the control group. In EMG measurements , conduction velocity and amplitudes in all nerves were low in the patient group. Similarly , latencies in all nerves were higher in patients with COPD. Central and peripheral nervous system involvement could develop in patients with moderate-severe COPD , and these patients should be monitored for neuropathic changes in combination with neurological examination.
