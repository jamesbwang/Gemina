  The regulatory role of long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) in various biological functions has been demonstrated. However , their role in fat deposition and lipid metabolism in pigs remains less understood. To explore the expression profile of lncRNAs in Jinhua and Landrace pigs , we investigated the expression levels of lncRNAs in intramuscular adipose tissues obtained from these pigs. Results showed that the expression levels of lncRNAs in these pig breeds significantly ( Fold Change â‰¥ 2.0 , FDR < 0.05) differed. A total of 4910 lncRNAs were identified , and 119 of these lncRNAs were differentially expressed. Of these differentially expressed lncRNAs , 60 and 59 were up- and down-regulated , respectively. The differentially expressed lncRNAs are involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) signaling pathway , Ras signaling pathway , PI3k-Akt signaling pathway. We then compared these differentially expressed lncRNAs with mRNAs and found that six of the co-expressed lncRNAs were implicated in pathways related to fat deposition and lipid metabolism. Overall , our results revealed a remarkable difference in fat metabolism in intramuscular adipose tissues of pigs , and provide a basis for subsequent research on fat deposition.
