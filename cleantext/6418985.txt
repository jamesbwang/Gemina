  Diagnostic codes are crucial for analyses of electronic health record ( EHR) data but their accuracy and precision are often lacking. Although providers enter precise diagnoses into progress notes , billing standards may limit the particularity of a diagnostic code. Variability also arises from the creation of multiple descriptions for a particular diagnostic code. We hypothesized that the variability of diagnostic codes would be greater before surgical pathology results were recorded in the medical record. A well annotated cohort of patients with brain neoplasms was studied. After diagnostic pathology reporting , the odds of more distinct diagnostic descriptions were 2.30 times higher ( p = 0.00358) , entropy in diagnostic sequences was 2.26 times higher ( p = 0.0259) and entropy in diagnostic precision scores was 15.5 times higher ( p = 0.0324). Although diagnostic codes became more distinct on average after diagnostic pathology reporting , there was a paradoxical increase in the variability of the codes selected. Researchers must be aware of the inconsistencies and variability in particularity in structured diagnostic coding despite the presence of a definitive diagnosis.
