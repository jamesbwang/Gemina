  Patulous Eustachian tube is a distressing condition characterised by chronic patency of the Eustachian tube and its failure to close. Patients typically present with symptoms of autophony and aural fullness. In patients requiring surgical intervention , a variety of different procedures have been demonstrated ( both transtympanic and endonasal) , with limited success. Evidence of the effectiveness of a number of surgical interventions is limited to small case series only. This paper describes a novel treatment for patulous Eustachian tube using a 3 mm VortX Diamond endovascular coil.Case reportA transnasal endoscopic approach was adopted , with cannulation of the Eustachian tube orifice using a Relieva sinus guide suction tube from a balloon sinuplasty set. The coil was deployed 1.5 cm deep into the Eustachian tube. Post-operative imaging was used to confirm correct positioning. Regular follow up was arranged. The patient reported complete resolution of her symptoms. The technique has so far proved highly effective and minimally invasive. It will be employed in more patients to fully establish its effectiveness in treating patulous Eustachian tube.
