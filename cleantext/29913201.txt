  Methylmercury ( MeHg) induces site-specific cerebrocortical neuronal cell death. In our previous study using an in vivo mouse model , we reported that MeHg-induced cerebrocortical neuronal cell death may be due to neural hyperactivity triggered by activation of kinase pathways. However , the detailed molecular mechanism remained to be completely understood. In this study , we analyzed detailed signaling pathways for MeHg-induced neuronal cell death using all-trans-retinoic acid ( RA) differentiated SH-SY5Y cells , which show neuron-like morphological changes and express neuron/synapse markers for cerebrocortical neurons. Time course studies revealed that MeHg-induced upregulation of c-fos , a marker of neural activation , preceded neuronal cell death. These results were similar to those observed in a MeHg-intoxicated mouse model. We observed early expression of the oxidative stress marker thymidine glycol followed by activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) and p38 MAPK , and an increase in cAMP response element binding protein ( CREB). Investigation of the effects of specific kinase inhibitors revealed that SB203580 , a specific inhibitor for p38 MAPK , significantly blocked the upregulation of c-fos and the subsequent neuronal cell death. In contrast , PD98059 and U0126 , specific inhibitors for p44/p42 MAPK , showed no effects on MeHg-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore , the antioxidants Trolox and edaravone significantly suppressed MeHg-induced thymidine glycol expression , p38 MAPK-CREB pathway activation , and neurotoxicity. Altogether , these results suggest that MeHg-induced oxidative stress and subsequent activation of the p38 MAPK-CREB pathway contribute to cerebrocortical neuronal hyperactivity and subsequent neuronal cell death.
