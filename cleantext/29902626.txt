  Our aim was to study the effects of glyphosate , tilling practice and cultivation history on mycorrhizal colonization and growth of target ( weeds) and non-target ( crops) plants. Glyphosate , the world 's most widely used pesticide , inhibits an enzyme found in plants but also in microbes. We examined the effects of glyphosate treatment applied in the preceding fall on growth of a perennial weed , Elymus repens<pathogen> ( target plant) and a forage grass , Festuca pratensis ( non-target plant) and their arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal ( AMF) root colonization in a field pot experiment. Non-target plants were sown in the following spring. Furthermore , we tested if glyphosate effects depend on tillage or soil properties modulated by long cultivation history of endophyte symbiotic grass ( E + grass). AMF root colonization , plant establishment and growth , glyphosate residues in plants , and soil chemistry were measured. Glyphosate reduced the mycorrhizal colonization and growth of both target and non-target grasses. The magnitude of reduction depended on tillage and soil properties due to cultivation history of E + grass. We detected glyphosate residues in weeds and crop plants in the growing season following the glyphosate treatment. Residues were higher in plants growing in no-till pots compared to conspecifics in tilled pots. These results demonstrate negative effects of glyphosate on non-target organisms in agricultural environments and grassland ecosystems.
