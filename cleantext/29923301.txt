  Reflux precipitation polymerization ( RPP) represents an effective approach that enables to prepare various types of polymeric nanogels with precise control over the morphology and structure. Owing to facile loading or modification by a variety of functional moieties , rationally designed nanogels pose the possibility to attain a platform for tailoring functional properties that could be widely used for various biomedical applications , such as multifunctional drug delivery , enrichment of functional peptides , separation of specific proteins , as well as detection of circulating tumor cells. This feature article highlights RPP as a promising polymerization strategy that provides access to facile generation of modular nanostructures or multifunctional properties in a diverse range of biomedical applications , proving that RPP has great potential to become one of the most attractive polymerization techniques in polymer chemistry.
