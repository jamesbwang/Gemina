  To investigate patients for positive culture rates with or without IRC PPs and to examine changes in culture positive isolates found in patients presenting overt clinical infection. Cultures were obtained from PPs immediately upon surgical exposure of the pump. 236 patients were broken down into 2 groups , with each further divided into 2 groups. The non-infected group included 208 patients: 133 with uncoated PPs and 75 with IRC implants. The infected group included 28 patients: 16 with uncoated PP and 12 with IRC IPP. Additionally , sensitivity to the combination of tetracycline and rifampin were evaluated on all cultures. In the non-infected group , culture positive isolates were found in 85 patients with uncoated PP 's and in 32 patients with IRC implants ( p-value = 0.0003). Cultures positive for Staphylococcus<pathogen> genus were found in 75 uncoated PP patients , while 20 patients with IRC implants had an isolate of this genus. In the infected group , culture positive isolates were found in 7 patients with uncoated PP and 6 patients with IRC IPPs ( p-value = 1.000). Positive cultures for Staphylococcus<pathogen> genus were found in 6 patients with uncoated PP , while 3 patients with IRC IPP had an isolate of this genus. All bacterial isolates were sensitive to the combination of tetracycline and rifampin. Positive bacterial cultures have been shown to be present on clinically uninfected IPPs at time of revision surgery. Culture isolates grown from patients with IRC IPPs reveal a non-traditional bacterial profile: fewer cultured isolates of Staphylococcus<pathogen> genus.
