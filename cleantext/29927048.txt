  The aim of the present randomized controlled trial ( RCT) was therefore the tridimensional evaluation of soft tissue changes after rapid maxillary expansion in growing patients. Treated group comprised 17 patients ( 10 males and 7 females) with a mean age of 9.8 ± 1.2 years , and control group comprised 17 patients ( 13 males and 4 females) with a mean age of 9.1 ± 2.1 years. All patients of the treated group underwent maxillary expansion with Haas-type expander while patients of the control group underwent no treatment. 3D facial scans were acquired at T1 , at the beginning of treatment or observation period , and at T2 , 18 months apart. The mean interval between the timepoints was 18.2 ± 0.4 months. The main differences between groups were reported in the nasal area. Nasal width ( Alr-All) significantly increased in the treated group compared with the control. The increase in intereye and mouth<symptom> width in the study group did not show differences with the control group. No significant differences were reported for lips ' protrusion , angular measurements and facial heights between groups. The total nose volume difference was significantly higher in the treated group compared with control , and this result was related mainly to the significant increase in the nasal dorsum volume. Maxillary expansion produced significant increase in the nasal base and nasal volumes , but its clinical relevance is still questionable.
