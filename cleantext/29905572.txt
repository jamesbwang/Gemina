  Cysteine protease is a superfamily of widespread proteolytic enzymes and plays a major role in larval invasion , migration , exsheathing , survival and immune evasion in parasites. In the present study , the gene coding cysteine proteinase of the nematode Trichinella spiralis ( Owen , 1835) was cloned into pQE-80L and subsequently expressed in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> JM109. The rTsCP was purified and its antigenicity was identified by Western blot and ELISA. Using anti-rTsCP serum the native TsCP was identified in muscle larval crude proteins. The results of quantitative real-time PCR and immunofluorescence test demonstrated that the TsCP was expressed in all stages of T. spiralis and located mainly in cuticle , stichosome and reproductive organs. The immunisation of mice with rTsCP elicited Th2-predominant immune responses. Anti-rTsCP antibodies could partially inhibit the in vitro larval invasion of intestinal epithelial cells and kill the newborn larvae by an antibody-dependent cell-mediated dose-dependent cytotoxicity. The vaccinated mice exhibited a 54 % reduction of adults and a 33 % reduction of muscle larvae following challenge infection. The results suggested that the TsCP might be an indispensable protein in Trichinella invasion , development and survival of T. spiralis in hosts , and could be a potential vaccine target against infection.
