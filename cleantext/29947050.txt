  To explore the indications and diagnostic outcomes of fetal exomes in a single referral center. 77 unrelated fetal samples underwent exome sequencing between 2012-2017. Indications , turnaround time , diagnostic rates , and pregnancy outcomes were investigated. The most common indication for fetal exome sequencing was multiple malformations ( 21/77 , 27 %) , followed by isolated brain malformations ( 15/77 , 19 %). Twelve fetuses ( 15 %) were referred for isolated increased nuchal translucency ( IINT). Exome analysis was diagnostic for 16 fetuses ( 21 %); when sub-classified to fetal malformations vs. IINT it became clear that exome analysis did not reveal any known or probable pathogenic variants in IINT whereas among the remaining fetuses , a molecular diagnosis was reached in 16/65 ( 25 %). Proband-only cases received a diagnosis more often than trio exomes. Exome sequencing has the potential to provide molecular diagnoses in cases where conventional prenatal cytogenetic testing is negative. A referral bias of consanguineous cases could account for the high diagnostic rate for proband-only sequencing. Syndrome-specific prognostic information enables parents to make informed decisions , whereas challenges include time limitations and variant interpretation in the setting of non-specific fetal findings. As we report only established disease-gene associations , further segregation and functional studies in a research setting are expected to significantly increase the diagnostic yield.
