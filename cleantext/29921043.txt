  Adverse drug reactions can cause considerable discomfort. They can be life-threatening in severe cases , requiring or prolonging hospitalization , impeding proper treatment , and increasing treatment costs considerably. Although the incidence of severe cutaneous adverse reactions ( SCARs) is low , they can be serious , have permanent sequelae , or lead to death. A recent pharmacogenomic study confirmed that genetic factors can predispose an individual to SCARs. Genetic markers enable not only elucidation of the pathogenesis of SCARs , but also screening of susceptible subjects. The human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) genotypes associated with SCARs include HLA-B * 57:01 for abacavir ( Caucasians) , HLA-B * 58:01 for allopurinol ( Asians) , HLA-B * 15:02 ( Han Chinese) and HLA-A * 31:01 ( Europeans and Koreans) for carbamazepine , HLA-B * 59:01 for methazolamide ( Koreans and Japanese) , and HLA-B * 13:01 for dapsone ( Asians). Therefore , prescreening genetic testing could prevent severe drug hypersensitivity<disease> reactions. Large-scale epidemiologic studies are required to demonstrate the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of screening tests because their efficacy is affected by the genetic differences among ethnicities.
