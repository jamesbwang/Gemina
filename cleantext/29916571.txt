  Health workers , particularly those working in palliative care , are confronted daily with situations that increase stress and emotional fatigue<symptom> , since constantly exposed to the disease and the death of patients. The proximity to the pain and the feelings of psychological suffering of patients submits them to a very intense emotional charge , making them susceptible to burnout. The skills required for those involved in this type of assistance are very specific and it is therefore necessary training that is aimed at providing the healthcare professional knowledge and basic skills , both professional and empathic , because the service is of good quality. Psychological support for nursing staff is a key factor in giving voice to the anxieties that inevitably rise in palliative care. The paper reports the evaluation of a psychological intervention for health workers ( doctors and nurses) of a Hospice of Central Italy. It was measured the level of burnout and alexithymia of the workers in order to investigate possible relationships between the two constructs and assess the change in scores after the psychological intervention. The results showed a positive correlation between the total score of alexithymia and emotional exhaustion<symptom> subscale ( r = .44 , p = .023) and an inverse correlation between the total score of alexithymia and Personal fulfilment subscale ( r =- 0:55 , p = .003). In addition , there is a reduction of the scores in both alexithymia dimensions and emotional exhaustion<symptom> subscale. The results show the effectiveness of the intervention and invite us to continue to search for further relations between the construct of burnout and alexithymia and other variables.
