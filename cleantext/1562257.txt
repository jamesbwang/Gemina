  Aniridia-associated glaucoma is often refractory to medical treatment. Glaucoma drainage device surgery is often considered after failed angle surgery. However , the potential complications of tube surgery in young children are not negligible. The failure rate of conventional trabeculectomy may be high and can require close and multiple postoperative follow-up visits. Here , we describe a child with aniridia who achieved good short-term results with deep sclerectomy. A 14-month-old girl was referred to our unit following bilateral trabeculotomies for aniridia-associated glaucoma and persistent uncontrolled intraocular pressure ( IOP) in both eyes. She underwent sequential bilateral deep sclerectomies with microperforations. The patient achieved normalized IOP in both eyes after 6-month follow-up without any complications. Deep sclerectomy , with microperforations , may be a reasonable surgical procedure to perform in children with aniridia with failed angle surgery before contemplating tube shunt surgery.
