  Isaacs syndrome<disease> is a rare peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndrome<disease>. The painful discharges in Isaacs syndrome<disease> are abolished by the blockade of the neuromuscular junction but not by peripheral nerve blocks ( PNB). However , the efficacy of PNB for intraoperative and postoperative analgesia among those with Isaacs syndrome<disease> is unknown. A 41-year-old woman with Isaacs syndrome<disease> underwent open reduction and internal fixation of radius fractures. Ultrasound-guided bilateral axillary brachial plexus blocks were performed , followed by general anesthesia. The patient required only a single low dose of rocuronium for intubation and surgery.
