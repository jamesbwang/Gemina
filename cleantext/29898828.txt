  To highlight the magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) signs associated with spinal dural arteriovenous fistula<disease> ( SDAVF) through categorisation of sources of radiological error and investigation of the delay to radiological diagnosis. This was a retrospective , observational study of cases referred to a neuroscience centre over 11 years. All patients who underwent spinal digital subtraction angiography ( DSA) with a subsequent diagnosis of SDAVF were identified. Prior imaging was reviewed and compared with the formal reports issued. Thirty-seven patients with SDAVF were initially imaged in seven institutions. Radiological abnormalities including intradural vessels ( 37/37 , 100 %) , cord T2 signal change ( 34/37 , 91.9 %) , and cord expansion ( 26/37 , 70.2 %) were present on prior MRI. These signs were not recognised in 22/37 ( 59.5 %) , 7/34 ( 20.5 %) , and 15/26 ( 57.7 %) of cases , respectively. Increased T2 signal in the cord was the most commonly identified sign ( 27/34; 79.4 %) , but prompted either no diagnosis ( 7/34; 20.5 %) or differential diagnoses including ischaemic , inflammatory , or neoplastic aetiologies or a syrinx in 11/34 ( 32.4 %). An appropriate diagnosis was made on initial MRI in 15 patients ( 40.5 %). The time from initial imaging to diagnosis was significantly delayed for those patients who did not have an arteriovenous vascular aetiology included in the initial differential diagnosis ( 281 ( 423.3) days versus 22 ( 15.7) days , p = 0.03). SDAVF have imaging features that are frequently missed or misinterpreted. This results in a significant delay to definitive diagnosis and therefore treatment.
