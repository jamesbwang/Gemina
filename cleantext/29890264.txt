  We evaluated the utilization of brachytherapy ( BT) in addition to external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT) and the resulting impact on survival in patients with cervical cancer after hysterectomy with positive surgical margins. Patients with cervical cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2015 who underwent hysterectomy followed by adjuvant EBRT were identified using the National Cancer Data Base. Only patients with positive surgical margins were included for analysis. Logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of BT utilization and for propensity score matching. Survival was compared between patients receiving EBRT alone and EBRT combined with BT for adjuvant treatment. Survival analysis using log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards modeling was performed in the overall and propensity score-matched cohorts. We identified 1,719 patients who received hysterectomy with positive surgical margins followed by adjuvant radiation therapy , of which 778 patients ( 45.3 %) received additional BT. Predictors of increased receipt of BT included age > 55 years , private rather than government insurance , radiation treatment duration ≥ 7 weeks , external beam radiation dose ≥ 4500 cGy , and time between radiation and surgery ≤ 9 weeks. With a median follow-up of 3.8 years , 3-year overall survival was 79.4 % in patients receiving BT compared to 71.9 % in patients receiving EBRT alone ( log-rank p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis , EBRT and BT was associated with significantly improved survival ( hazard ratio 0.77; 95 % confidence interval 0.64-0.92; p = 0.003) compared to EBRT alone. The survival benefit of combining EBRT and BT persisted on propensity score-matched analysis ( log-rank p = 0.005). In women with positive margins after hysterectomy for cervical cancer , the combination of EBRT and BT showed significantly improved overall survival compared to EBRT alone. However , only 45.3 % of patients in our cohort received BT.
