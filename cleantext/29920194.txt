  To evaluate the outcomes of neglected pilon fractures treated by the Ilizarov fixator and to determine whether this technique was successful in avoiding an ankle arthrodesis. Retrospective case series. Level I university trauma center. Between January 2003 and March 2015 , 18 patients ( mean age of 42.17 years) with an untreated pilon fracture with late presentation ( > 1 month) were evaluated. Six patients were women and 12 were men. The mean duration from trauma to management was 11.17 weeks ( range: 7-15). All fractures were OTA/AO 43 type C. Four cases were open fractures. Closed fracture reduction , correction of deformity , and restoration of alignment by the Ilizarov fixator. The radiographs were evaluated for tibial alignment , quality of reduction , and development of arthrosis. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ( AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scale was used for functional assessment. The follow-up period ranged from 18 to 168 months ( mean; 38.00). The quality of reduction was excellent in 2 cases , satisfactory in 13 cases , and poor in 3 cases. The external fixator period averaged 29.06 weeks ( range: 6.1-7.5 months). All fractures healed without deep infection. Ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion averaged 8.67 and 25.67 degrees , respectively , in 15 cases. Arthrodesis was performed for the remaining 3 cases. The mean AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot score was 82.67. One case had mild anterior translation , and another 1 had a procurvatum of 5 degrees. Arthrosis developed in 6 ankles. A satisfactory outcome was achieved after management by the Ilizarov fixator while avoiding arthrodesis in most cases of this series of neglected pilon fractures. Therapeutic Level IV.
