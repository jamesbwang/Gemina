  Psychological resilience reflects the capacity to bounce back from stress , which plays an important role in health and well-being. However , less is known about the neural substrate for psychological resilience and the underlying mechanism for how psychological resilience enhances subjective well-being in the healthy brain. To investigate these issues , we employed fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations ( fALFF) measured with resting-state fMRI in 100 young healthy adults. The correlation analysis found that higher psychological resilience was related to lower fALFF in the left orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC) , which is involved in reward-related processing and emotion regulation. Furthermore , the mediation analysis indicated that psychological resilience acted as a full mediator of the association between the fALFF in left OFC and subjective well-being indicators ( i.e. , life satisfaction and hedonic balance<symptom>). Importantly , these results remained significant after controlling for the effect of gray matter volume and regional homogeneity in the region. Overall , the present study provides the further evidence for functional neural substrates of psychological resilience and reveals a potential mechanism that psychological resilience mediates the effect of spontaneous brain activity on subjective well-being.
