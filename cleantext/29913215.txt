  Due to the inhibitory microenvironment and reduced intrinsic growth capacity of neurons , neuronal regeneration of central nervous system remains challenging. Neurons are highly energy demanding and require sufficient mitochondria to support cellular activities. In response to stimuli , mitochondria undergo fusion/fission cycles to adapt to environment. It is thus logical to hypothesize that the plasticity of mitochondrial dynamics is required for neuronal regeneration. In this study , we examined the role of mitochondrial dynamics during regeneration of rat hippocampal neurons. Quantitative analysis showed that injury induced mitochondrial fission. As mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases , we tested the possibility that the mitochondrial therapy may promote neuronal regeneration. Supplying freshly isolated mitochondria to the injured hippocampal neurons not only significantly increased neurite re-growth but also restored membrane potential of injured hippocampal neurons. Together , our findings support the importance of mitochondrial dynamics during regeneration of injured hippocampal neurons and highlight the therapeutic prospect of mitochondria to the injured central nervous system.
