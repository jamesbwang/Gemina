  After severe ( primary) brain injury , Dutch physician-based helicopter emergency medical services start therapy to lower the intracranial pressure ( ICP) on scene to stop or delay secondary brain injury. In some cases , helicopter transportation to the nearest level 1 trauma center is indicated. During transportation , the head-down position may counteract the ICP-lowering strategies because of venous blood pooling in the head. To examine this theory , we measured the optic nerve sheath diameter ( ONSD) during helicopter transport in healthy volunteers. The ONSD was measured by ultrasound in healthy volunteers during helicopter liftoff and acceleration in the supine position or with a raised headrest. In this proof-of-principle study , the ONSD increased during helicopter acceleration ( -9 ° Trendelenburg , mean = 5.6 ± .3 mm) from baseline ( 0 ° supine position , mean = 5.0 ± .4 mm). After headrest elevation ( 20 ° -25 °) , the ONSD did not increase during helicopter acceleration ( mean ONSD = 5.0 ± .5 mm). ONSD and ICP seem to increase during helicopter transportation in -9 ° head-down ( Trendelenburg) position. By raising the headrest of the gurney before liftoff , these effects can be prevented.
