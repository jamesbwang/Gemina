  To establish normal reference ranges and In a prospective study , 268 preterm infants who fulfilled the criteria for inclusion were examined. Echocardiograms were performed to measure the ascending aorta , transverse aorta , and aortic isthmus diameters on 0 days to 6 days of life and at weekly intervals until the babies reached 36 weeks. Body surface area was divided into 13 groups from 0.07 m The mean gestational age was 29.8 ( ± 2.38 standard deviation ( SD)) weeks , ranging from 24 weeks to 35 weeks. The mean body<symptom> weight was 1479 ( ± 413 SD) g , ranging from 588 g to 3380 g , and the mean body surface area was 0.13 m The ascending aorta , transverse aorta , and aortic isthmus diameters exhibited a significant correlation with the body surface area and body<symptom> weight. This study provides reference data with
