  The socioeconomic burden of chronic back pain related to intervertebral disc ( IVD) disease is high and current treatments are only symptomatic. Minimally invasive strategies that promote biological IVD repair should address this unmet need. Notochordal cells ( NCs) are replaced by chondrocyte-like cells ( CLCs) during IVD maturation and degeneration. The regenerative potential of NC-secreted substances on CLCs and mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs) has already been demonstrated. However , identification of these substances remains elusive. Innovatively , this study exploits the regenerative NC potential by using healthy porcine NC-derived matrix ( NCM) and employs the dog as a clinically relevant translational model. NCM increased the glycosaminoglycan and DNA content of human and canine CLC aggregates and facilitated chondrogenic differentiation of canine MSCs
