  To gain insight into the opinions and working methods of diabetes care providers after using a diabetes web portal for 4 years in order to understand the role of the provider in patients ' web portal use. Survey among physicians and nurses from general practices and an outpatient clinic , correlated with data from the common web portal. One hundred twenty-eight questionnaires were analysed ( response rate 56.6 %). Responders ' mean age was 46.2 Â± 9.8 years and 43.8 % were physicians. The majority was of opinion that the portal improves patients ' diabetes knowledge ( 90.6 %) and quality of care ( 72.7 %). Although uploading glucose diary ( 93.6 %) and patient access to laboratory and clinical notes ( 91.2 and 71.0 %) were considered important , these features were recommended to patients in only 71.8 and 19.5 % respectively. 64.8 % declared they informed their patients about the portal and 45.3 % handed-out the information leaflet and website address. The portal was especially recommended to type 1 diabetes patients ( 78.3 %); those on insulin ( 84.3 %) and patients aged < 65 years ( 72.4 %). Few found it timesaving ( 21.9 %). Diabetes care providers ' opinions were not associated with patients ' portal use. Providers are positive about patients web portals but still not recommend or encourage the use to all patients. There seems room for improvement in their working methods.
