  Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) is a lifelong , progressive disease that has disabling impacts on patient 's lives. Given the complex nature of the diagnosis of IBD and its management there is consequently a large economic burden seen across all health care systems. Quality indicators ( QI) have been created to assess the different fa√ßades of disease management including structure , process and outcome components. Their development serves to provide a means to target and measure quality of care ( QoC). Multiple different QI sets have been published in IBD , but all serve the same purpose of trying to achieve a standard of care that can be attained on a national and international level , since there is still a major variation in clinical practice. There have been many recent innovative developments that aim to improve QoC in IBD including telemedicine , home biomarker assessment and rapid access clinics. These are some of the novel advancements that have been shown to have great potential at improving QoC , while offloading some of the burden that IBD can have vis-a-vis emergency room visits and hospital admissions. The aim of the current review is to summarize and discuss available QI sets and recent developments in IBD care including telemedicine , and to give insight into how the utilization of these tools could benefit the QoC of IBD patients. Additionally , a treating-to-target structure as well as evidence surrounding aggressive management directed at tighter disease control will be presented.
