  Background/aim: This study aimed to evaluate the facial nerve ( FN) and internal auditory canal ( IAC) on three-dimensional fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition ( 3D-FIESTA) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) to define possible structural differences in cases of Bell 's palsy ( BP). Materials and methods: Fifty-six patients presenting with BP were included in this study. The measurements of the diameters and the cross-sectional areas ( CSAs) of the FNs and IACs obtained on 3D-FIESTA MRI both on the affected and unaffected sides of all patients were compared. Results: A significant difference was found between affected and unaffected sides of the patients in terms of the mean CSA of the FN and IAC ( P < 0.001). The CSAs of the FN were larger and the CSAs of the IAC were smaller on the affected sides than the equivalents on the unaffected sides of the patients , respectively. The difference in terms of the ratios of IAC CSA to FN CSA between affected and unaffected sides of the patients was also found to be statistically significant ( P < 0.001). Conclusion: We have found that FN and IAC size differ on the affected sides of patients with BP. These anatomical differences may contribute to the risk for this disease.
