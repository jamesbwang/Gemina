  A rapid analytical method had been developed for the screening of three halogenated salicylanilines in cosmetics using ambition ionization coupled with ion mobility spectrometry. Without time-consuming pretreatment , cosmetic samples of lotion , lipstick and powder were added or smudged onto a Grade 3MM chromatography paper for paper spray ionization , cosmetic samples of cream and shampoo were simply loaded with a metal wire probe for extraction nano-electrospray. The limits of detection ( LODs) for the three halogenated salicylanilides were 50 Î¼g/kg. The instrumental analysis time for a single ion mobility spectrometry run was less than 15 ms. The suspected positive samples were subjected to further verification by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The method is simple , rapid , and with low cost and is suitable for rapid , on-site screening of cosmetics.
