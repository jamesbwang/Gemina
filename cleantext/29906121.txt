  The combination of chlorine and UV ( i.e. , chlorine-UV process) has been attracting more attention in recent years due to its ready incorporation into existing water treatment facilities to remove PPCPs. However , limited information is available on the impact of total ammonia<pathogen> nitrogen ( TAN). This study investigated two model PPCPs , N,N-diethyl-3-toluamide ( DEET) and caffeine ( CAF) , in the two stages of the chlorine-UV process ( i.e. , chlorination and UV/chlor ( am) ine) to elucidate the impact of TAN. During chlorination , the degradation of DEET and CAF was positively correlated with the overall consumption of total chlorine by TAN. Reactive nitrogen intermediates , including HNO/NO
