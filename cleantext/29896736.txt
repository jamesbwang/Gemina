  To carry out phylogenetic analysis for drug-resistance genes from clinical isolates of Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori ( Hp) among patients with gastric diseases from Tibet , China. Hp strains were isolated and cultured from saliva and gastric mucosal tissues derived from patients with gastric diseases. Nine strains ( including 5 isolated from oral tissues , 1 isolated from gastric tissues , and 3 representative strains of SS international standard strains used for animal models) were tested for common antibiotic resistance. Together with an ACTT 11637 international standard strain , these were subjected to re-sequencing to obtain drug-resistance genes. Such genes from various sources were compared with the resistance genes of Hp strains recorded by the NCBI website. Combined with results of drug-resistance experiments , correlation between molecular evolution and drug-resistance was analyzed. Testing of gastric mucosal tissues and salivary samples from 217 patients has found 89 Hp strains , which yielded a total infection rate of 41.01 %. The resistance rates of 9 representative Hp strains for clarithromycin , amoxicillin , metronidazole , levofloxacin and tetracycline were 77.8 % , 77.8 % , 44.4 % , 77.8 % , and 77.8 % , respectively. Compared with the reference strain , the similarity between clarithromycin-resistance genes was 99 % , and that between amoxicillin- and metronidazole-resistance genes was 96 % -97 %. A2143G mutation was also found in clarithromycin-resistant genes of three Hp strains. The sensitivity of Hp to metronidazole is much higher in patients from Tibet region , and the sensitivity of Hp to clarithromycin , amoxicillin , levofloxacin and tetracycline is poor. Resistance mutations are consistent with drug resistance.
