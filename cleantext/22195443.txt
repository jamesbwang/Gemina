  As healthcare costs rise and reimbursements decrease , healthcare organization leadership and clinical providers must collaborate to provide high-value healthcare. Medications are a key driver of the increasing cost of healthcare , largely as a result of the proliferation of expensive specialty drugs , including biologic agents. Such medications contribute significantly to the inpatient diagnosis-related group payment system , often with minimal or unproved benefit over less-expensive therapies. To describe a systematic review process to reduce non-evidence-based inpatient use of high-cost medications across a large multihospital academic health system. We created a Pharmacy & Therapeutics subcommittee consisting of clinicians , pharmacists , and an ethics representative. This committee developed a standardized process for a timely review ( < 48 hours) and approval of high-cost medications based on their clinical effectiveness , safety , and appropriateness. The engagement of clinical experts in the development of the consensus-based guidelines for the use of specific medications facilitated the clinicians ' acceptance of the review process. Over a 2-year period , a total of 85 patient-specific requests underwent formal review. All reviews were conducted within 48 hours. This review process has reduced the non-evidence-based use of specialty medications and has resulted in a pharmacy savings of $ 491,000 in fiscal year 2016 , with almost 80 % of the savings occurring in the last 2 quarters , because our process has matured. The creation of a collaborative review process to ensure consistent , evidence-based utilization of high-cost medications provides value-based care , while minimizing unnecessary practice variation and reducing the cost of inpatient care.
