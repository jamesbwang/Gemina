  Drosophila melanogaster is a new model organism for studies in exercise biology. To date , two main exercise systems , the Power Tower and the Treadwheel have been described. However , a method to measure the amount of additional animal activity induced through the exercise treatment has been lacking. The Rotating Exercise Quantification System ( REQS) fills this need , providing a measure of animal activity for animals experiencing rotational exercise. This protocol details how to use the REQS to assess animal activity during rotational exercise and illustrates the type of data that can be generated. Here , we demonstrate how the REQS is used to measure sex- and strain-specific differences in exercise induced activity. The REQS can also be used to evaluate the impact of various other experimental parameters such as age , diet , or population size on exercise induced activity. In addition , it can be used to compare the efficacy of different exercise training protocols. Importantly , it provides an opportunity to standardize exercise treatments between strains , allowing the researcher to achieve equal amounts of activity between groups if needed. Thus , the REQS is a notable new resource for exercise biologists working with the Drosophila model system and complements existing exercise systems.
