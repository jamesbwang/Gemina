  Despite emerging evidence suggesting harmful influences of accurate weight perception on psychological health among individuals with obesity , little is known about the association in Asian populations. The aim of this study was investigate the association between body<symptom> weight perception and depressive symptoms among Korean adults , and potential differential associations across gender. We used data from the sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2014 , comprising 3,318 female ( n = 1,876) and male ( n = 1,442) participants , aged 19-65 years , with no history of depression<symptom> and a body-mass index ( BMI) > = 18.5 kg/m2. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Korean version. Weight perception patterns were categorized by comparing self-perceived and objectively measured weight<symptom> status<symptom>. Gender-stratified four-level multilevel linear models adjusted for age , BMI , menopause , education , income , marital status , urbanicity , chronic conditions , exercise , smoking , and alcohol use. Subgroup analyses were performed across BMI category. Among women with obesity , those who underperceived their weight<symptom> status<symptom> reported fewer depressive symptoms compared to those who accurately perceived their weight<symptom> status<symptom> ( β = -1.25 , p < 0.05). Among women with normal weight , those who overperceived their weight<symptom> status<symptom> reported more depressive symptoms compared to those who accurately perceived their weight<symptom> status<symptom> ( β = 1.00 , p < 0.05). The same associations were not found in men. Awareness-oriented strategies for obesity prevention and weight management focused on providing information on weight<symptom> status<symptom> may need to consider unintended consequences of accurate weight perception on mental health among individuals with obesity , particularly among women.
