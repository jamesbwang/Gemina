  In order to enrich the library of SSR and provide more powerful tools for molecular marker-assisted breeding in Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus , simple sequence repeats ( SSR) loci in its transcriptome were searched in 18 040 unigenes ( > = 1 kb) by using MISA. SSR loci information was analyzed and SSR primers were designed by Primer 3. Furthermore , 110 pairs of primers were randomly selected for the polymorphic analysis on 20 plants collected from different habitats. A total of 5 640 SSRs were found in the transcriptome of A. membranaceus var. mongholicus , distributed in 4 462 unigenes with the distribution frequency of 31.26 %. SSR loci occurred every 6 514 bp. Mono-nucleotide repeat was the main type , accounted for as much as 36.72 % of all SSRs , followed by tri-nucleotide ( 32.57 %) and di-nucleotide ( 27.73 %) repeat motif. Among all 75 repeat types , A/T ( 2 026) was the predominant one followed by AG/CT ( 1 179) , AAG/CTT ( 477). For validating the availability of the SSR primers designed using Primer 3 , 110 pairs of primers were randomly selected for PCR amplification. Among them , 97 pairs of primers ( 88.18 %) produced clear and reproductive bands. Using 19 pairs of primers showed polymorphism , 20 plants were divded into two groups by UPGMA. There are numerous SSRs in A. membranaceus var. mongholicus transcriptome with high frequency and various types , this will provide the abundant candidate molecular markers for genetic diversity , molecular identification , and marker-assisted breeding study for this plant.
