  One of the most frequent complications of transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI) is the occurrence of atrioventricular ( AV) conduction disorders secondary to AV node or His bundle injury leading to permanent pacemaker implantation ( PPI). The objective was to quantify the rate of ventricular pacing ( VP) , according to post-TAVI indication for PPI using recorded pacemaker memory. From October 2009 to January 2017 ' all patients who had PPI following TAVI performed at Rouen University Hospital were included. Indications for PPI were: ≥ 1 episode of complete atrioventricular block ( CAVB) or 2:1 atrioventricular block , and new-onset persistent left bundle branch block ( NOP-LBBB) with either prolonged PR interval ( > 200 ms) or HV interval ( > 70 ms). The primary endpoint was VP percentage at the first pacemaker interrogation ( a VP percentage ≥ 1 % was considered as significant). Out of 936 TAVI patients ( Sapien-3 ' n = 379 ( Edwards Lifesciences , Irvine , CA , USA); Sapien-XT ' n = 513; CoreValve ' n = 44 , Medtronic , Minneapolis , MN , USA) , 87 ( 9.3 %) had PPI. Eighty of these 87 patients were followed-up and analyzed. At the first pacemaker interrogation , a significant VP percentage was observed in 60/80 followed-up patients ( 75 %) , in 46/51 patients ( 90.2 %) implanted for CAVB , and 12/23 patients ( 52.2 %) implanted for NOP-LBBB associated with either prolonged PR or HV interval. No clinical predictive factor of significant VP percentage was found. In the post-TAVI period , our data support PPI in patients with CAVB even if paroxysmal. Our data also suggest PPI may be considered in patients with NOP-LBBB associated with either prolonged PR or HV interval.
