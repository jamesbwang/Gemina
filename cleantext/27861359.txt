  This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( PNMES) for treating neck<symptom> pain<symptom> in patients with cervical spondylosis ( CS). One hundred and twenty four patients with neck<symptom> pain<symptom> of CS were included , and then they were randomly divided into a PNMES group and a control group in a ratio of 1:1. All patients received PNMES or sham PNMES 30 minutes daily , 3 times weekly for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was assessed by the visual analog scale ( VAS). The secondary outcomes were evaluated by the cervical range of motion ( ROM) , neck disability index ( NDI) score , as well as the adverse events ( AEs). All outcome measurements were measured at the end of 12-week treatment , and 4-week follow-up after treatment. At the end of the 12-week treatment , and 4-week follow-up , the patients receiving PNMES exhibited more decrease in the mean VAS ( P < .01) , and NDI ( P < .01) respectively , compared with the patients receiving sham PNMES. Additionally , the increase in the mean ROM was also significantly higher in the PNMES group than that in the sham PNMES group at the end of the 12-week treatment , and 4-week follow-up , respectively ( P < .01). No AEs were found in either group. The results of this study demonstrated that PNMES is more effective than Sham PNMES for neck<symptom> pain<symptom> relief in patients with CS.
