  Study habits of medical students contribute to better understanding learner achievement and success. This study examines the relationship between study habits , including gender and nonacademic factors that affect learning , to investigate their relationship with performance outcomes. This study was conducted in March 2015 at the College of Medicine and Applied Medical Science at Taif University. A survey was administered , measuring study habits such as study time , study partners , source of study , breaks , study interruptions , difficulty concentrating , study activity , and delayed study. Comparisons were examined by high and low grade point average ( GPA) and by gender. A total of 257 students completed the questionnaire ( 59 % high GPA and 41 % low GPA; 50 % males and 50 % females). Results indicated significant differences for time of study , study materials , study interruptions , study enjoyment between students of high and low GPAs. Gender differences were found for study time , study methods , study breaks , student activity , and delayed study time. This study found that study habits differ by gender and also have significant impact on performance outcomes of learners. Given that students ' academic success is an important outcome for medical schools , these findings call for implementing these results to enhance curricular changes and promote better learning outcomes.
