  Thromboembolism is the most frequent complication in endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms<disease> , causing disability and death. As stent retrievers have achieved high rates of arterial recanalization in the management of ischemic stroke , these devices were tested as rescue therapy of thromboembolism during aneurysm<disease> embolization. We retrospectively analyzed 10 consecutive patients with transprocedural arterial occlusion , treated with mechanical thrombectomy at a single center. Good angiographic recanalization was achieved in eight cases , mTICI 3 , 2b and 2a in five , three and two patients , respectively , without additional complications or any deaths. Five patients showed complete recovery ( mRS 0) and all patients showed improvement of disability ( average mRS 1.1) over a mean follow-up period of 31 months. Eight patients had good clinical recovery , while two remained with deficits ( mRS 3 and 4). The study found that the stent retriever is a valuable , rapid and effective tool for restoring blood flow , improving the safety of endovascular treatment.
