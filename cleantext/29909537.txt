  Sustainable agriculture ensures food security and prevents starvation. However , the need to meet the increasing food demands of the growing population has led to poor and unsustainable agricultural practices , which promote environmental degradation. Given the contributions of agricultural ecosystems to environmental pollution , we investigated the impact of the agricultural ecosystem on environmental pollution in China using time series data from 1960 to 2014. We employed several methods for econometric analysis including the unit root test , Johansen test of cointegration , Granger causality test , and vector error correction model. Evidence based on the long-run elasticity indicates that a 1 % increase in the emissions of carbon dioxide ( CO
