  The benefits of renin angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors ( RAASi) are well-established in the general population , particularly among those with diabetes , congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( CHF) , or coronary artery disease ( CAD). However , conflicting evidence from trials and concerns about hyperkalemia limit RAASi use in hemodialysis patients , relative to other antihypertensive agents , including beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. Therefore , we investigated prescription patterns and associations with mortality for RAASi and other antihypertensive agents using data from the international Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study ( DOPPS). Cox regression was used to estimate the effect of the prescription of RAASi and other antihypertensive agents at study entry on mortality in 11,421 incident ( 120 days or less) hemodialysis and 37,124 prevalent ( over 120 days) hemodialysis patients from DOPPS phases 2-5 ( 2002-2015). Over 95 % of RAASi were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. RAASi prevalence was 39 % and varied minimally by CHF and CAD. The adjusted hazard ratio for RAASi ( vs. no RAASi) was 0.89 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.80-0.99) among incident and 0.94 ( 0.90-0.99) among prevalent hemodialysis patients , with no convincing evidence of interaction with diabetes , CAD or CHF. Inverse associations with mortality were also observed for beta blockers and calcium channel blockers , and were stronger for angiotensin receptor blockers than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors , but this latter finding requires further study. Thus , our observations suggest a relatively small survival benefit of RAASi and other antihypertensive agents in hemodialysis patients , though randomized prospective studies are needed to potentially change prescribing criteria.
