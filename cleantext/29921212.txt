  Dantrolene , a ryanodine receptor antagonist , is primarily known as the only clinically acceptable and effective treatment for malignant hyperthermia<symptom> ( MH). Inhibition of ryanodine receptor ( RyR) by dantrolene decrease the abnormal calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR) or endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) , where RyR is located on. Recently , emerging researchs on dissociated cells , brains slices , live animal models and patients demonstrate that altered RyR expression and function can also play a vital role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). Therefore , dantrolene is now widely studied as a novel treatment for AD , targeting the blockade of RyR channels or other alternative pathway , such as the inhibitory effects of NMDA glutamate receptors and the effects of ER-mitochondria connection. However the therapeutic effects are not consistent. In this review , we focus on the relationship between the altered RyR expression and function and the pathogenesis of AD , and the potential application of dantrolene as a novel treatment for the disease.
