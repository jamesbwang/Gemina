  The haustorium in parasitic plants is an organ specialized for invasion and nutrient uptake from host plant tissues. Despite its importance , the developmental processes of haustoria are mostly unknown. To understand the dynamics of cell fate change and cellular lineage during haustorium development , we performed live imaging-based marker expression analysis and cell-lineage tracing during haustorium formation in the model facultative root parasite
