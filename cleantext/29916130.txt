  Near occlusion ( NO) of the internal carotid artery ( ICA) with full collapse ( NOFC) is a rare condition , with a prevalence of around 1 %. Guidelines on carotid stenosis recommend a conservative treatment in patients with a single-event ipsilateral to a NOFC , but the optimal treatment for patients with recurrent symptoms associated with NOFC remains uncertain. We describe a consecutive series of patients with recurrent symptoms associated with NOFC ( RSNOFC) who underwent carotid endarterectomy ( CEA). From 2008 to 2017 , 17 consecutive patients with RSNOFC were treated according to our standardized multidisciplinary work-up and protocol and included for this single-center cohort study. NO was defined according to the angiographic North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria. Only patients with NOFC were included in this study. Standard longitudinal CEA was performed in 15 patients , whereas in 2 patients the ICA was ligated with concomitant endarterectomy of the ECA. Within 30 postoperative days , one patient died from a hemorrhagic infarction. During follow-up ( median 23 months) one patient died of unknown cause 90 days after CEA. No TIA , stroke , myocardial infarction or re-stenosis occurred in the remaining patients. In patients with RSNOFC , CEA may be considered a potential treatment option. Although procedural risks in this small subgroup may be higher as compared to patients with low-to-moderate risk anatomy , this risk may outbalance the natural course.
