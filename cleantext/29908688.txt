  Several studies have demonstrated that honey consumption has beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease indicators. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of honey consumption compared with sucrose on lipid profile among young healthy subjects. Sixty healthy subjects , aged 18-30 years , were randomly recruited into this double blind randomized trial and assigned into two groups: honey ( received 70 g honey per day) and sucrose ( received 70 g sucrose per day) groups. Total cholesterol , TG , LDL and HDL were measured in the control and intervention groups at the beginning and end of study. In this trial , the baseline FBS , SBP and DBP were not different between honey and sucrose groups ( P > 0.3). We found evidence indicating consumption of honey can decrease total cholesterol , TG and LDL and increase HDL in healthy young subjects , but intake of sucrose increase total cholesterol , TG and LDL and decreased HDL. In all of these analyses , confounding variable including age , physical activity and some nutrient intake were adjusted. Honey consumption can improve the lipid profile such as; total cholesterol , TG and LDL and increase HDL , but consumption of sucrose increases total cholesterol , TG and LDL and decreases HDL. Further clinical trial studies are required to confirm our findings.
