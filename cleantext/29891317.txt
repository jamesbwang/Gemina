  To assess the immunomodulatory and antioxidant activities of a Se-polysaccharide from Se-enriched G. frondosa ( Se-GFP-22) , immunosuppressed mice models were generated by cyclophosphamide ( CTX) administration and then treated with Se-GFP-22. Results showed that Se-GFP-22 could increase thymus and spleen indices , phagocytic index , co-mitogenic ( ConA- or LPS-stimulated) activities on splenocytes , DTH reaction , serum hemolysin formation and immunoglobulin ( Ig G , Ig A and Ig M) levels in CTX-treated mice. Se-GFP-22 significantly enhanced the antioxidant activity in CTX-treated mice , as shown by the evaluation of GSH-Px , SOD and CAT activities , as well as MDA levels in serum , liver and kidney. Se-GFP-22 strongly stimulated inflammatory cytokines ( IL-2 and IFN-γ) and NO productions by up-regulating mRNA expressions of IL-2 , IFN-γ and iNOS. Se-GFP-22 possessed the immunomodulatory activity by up-regulating various transcription factors ( JNK , ERK , and p38) in MAPKs signaling pathways. This study suggested that Se-GFP-22 may provide an alternative strategy in lessening chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression.
