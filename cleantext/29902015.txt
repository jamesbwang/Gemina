  A catalytic , metal-free intramolecular rearrangement of benzyl phenyl ethers using nitrosonium salt as a catalyst is described. The optimized reaction conditions enabled a catalytic and metal-free Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction with benzylic alcohols , producing water as the stoichiometric byproduct. A comprehensive scope ( > 50 examples) for both approaches and application in drug synthesis were demonstrated. Mechanistic studies suggest a Lewis acid-based mechanism for the metal-free Friedel-Crafts reaction.
