  Sarcoidosis is believed to be caused by both genetic and environmental risk factors , but the proportion of the susceptibility to sarcoidosis which is mediated by genetics remains unknown. We aimed to estimate the familial aggregation and heritability of sarcoidosis using a case-control-family study design and population-based Swedish registers.We identified 23 880 individuals with visits for sarcoidosis in the National Patient Register using ICD codes ( 1964 2013). Information Löfgren 's syndrome<disease> was available for a subset diagnosed at Karolinska University Hospital. General population controls were matched to cases ( 10:1). Relatives of cases and controls were identified from the Multi-Generation Register and ascertained for sarcoidosis in the Patient Register. We estimated familial relative risks ( RR) for sarcoidosis using conditional logistic regression and the heritability using biometric models.Having ≥ 1 first degree relative with sarcoidosis was associated with a 3.7-fold increase in the risk for sarcoidosis ( 95 % CI 3.4-4.1). The RR increased in those with ≥ 2 relatives ( RR 4.7) and in Löfgren 's syndrome<disease> ( RR 4.1). The heritability was 39 % ( 95 % CI 12-65). This large investigation showed that having a relative with sarcoidosis is a very strong risk factor for the disease. Genetic variation is an important , albeit partial , contributing factor to the risk for sarcoidosis.
