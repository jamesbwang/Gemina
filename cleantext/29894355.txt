  Stroke due to atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> has been associated with a high risk of disability and mortality. Percutaneous left atrial appendage ( LAA) closure has been established as an alternative strategy for stroke prevention in patients not eligible for oral anticoagulation. The LAmbre is a novel occluder , specifically designed for LAA closure adaptive to various LAA anatomies. The aim of this study was to demonstrate feasibility and initial experience in a nonprescreened patient cohort for LAA occlusion using the novel LAmbre occluder. The device was implanted in 11 patients with nonvalvular atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. Follow-up included transesophageal echocardiography and an outpatient visit at 6 weeks and 6 months after implantation. All devices were implanted successfully. Device sizes ranged from 16/22 to 22/34 mm. Patients ' mean CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores were 3.3 ± 1.0 and 3.2 ± 1.0 , respectively. Two out of 11 patients had previously been rejected for Watchman occluder implantation by reasons of too small LAA. At 6 weeks and 6 months , there were no deaths , strokes , systemic thromboembolism or severe<symptom> bleeding<symptom> complications. There was no device-related thrombus or pericardial<symptom> effusion<symptom> seen with transesophageal echocardiography. In one out of 11 patients , a minimal peridevice flow ( less than 5 mm) was present at 6-week follow-up. The LAmbre occluder is a novel LAA-closure device with features that provide many options for LAA-closure to physicians , particularly in patients with challenging anatomies. From our initial experience , implantation is associated with a good success rate and clinical outcome.
