  With the growth in co-development deals between pharmaceutical companies and the increased use of contract research organizations ( CROs) in drug development , more and more employees are encountering projects that require working across different companies. Navigating the mix of corporate cultures as well as variations in standards and procedures can lead to unanticipated challenges and delays. The development of ertugliflozin , a recently approved medicine for type 2 diabetes mellitus , involved both co-development and CRO engagement across 4 companies. Challenges to combining processes and systems across the 4 companies were encountered and resolved. Early decisions for adoption of standards and processes as well as the organization of committees and communication pathways were key to the success of this ambitious program. Here we share our experiences and lessons learned with respect to the analysis and reporting of clinical trial results.
