  The formation of a regular lattice of quantized vortices in a fluid under rotation is a smoking-gun signature of its superfluid nature. Here we study the vortex lattice in a dilute superfluid gas of bosonic atoms at zero temperature along the crossover from the weak-coupling regime , where the inter-atomic scattering length is very small compared to the average distance between atoms , to the unitarity regime , where the inter-atomic scattering length diverges. This study is based on high-performance numerical simulations of the time-dependent nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation for the superfluid order parameter in three spatial dimensions , using a realistic analytical expression for the bulk equation of state of the system along the crossover from weak-coupling to unitarity. This equation of state has the correct weak-coupling and unitarity limits and faithfully reproduces the results of an accurate multi-orbital microscopic calculation. Our numerical predictions of the number of vortices and root-mean-square sizes are important benchmarks for future experiments.
