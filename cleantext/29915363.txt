  Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG) is an effective bariatric surgery to treat obesity , and involves removal of the gastric fundus where ghrelin is mainly produced. Ghrelin stimulates appetite<symptom> and regulates food intake through its effect on the hypothalamus and hippocampus ( HIPP). While ghrelin 's role on the hypothalamus has been explored , little is known about its role on HIPP. We tested the hypothesis that LSG-induced reductions in ghrelin levels would be associated with changes in HIPP activity. Brain activity was measured with amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations ( ALFF) captured with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) in 30 obese participants , both before and after 1-month of LSG , and in 26 obese controls without surgery that were studied at baseline and 1-month later. A two-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA) was performed to model the group and time effects on ALFF and resting-state functional connectivity. One-month post-LSG there were significant decreases in appetite<symptom> , body mass index ( BMI) , fasting plasma ghrelin and leptin levels , anxiety<symptom> , and ALFF in HIPP and ALFF increases in posterior cingulate cortex ( PCC , P These findings suggest that ghrelin effects in HIPP modulate connectivity with the insula , which processes interoception and might be relevant to LSG-induced reductions in appetite/anxiety. Role of LSG in PCC and its enhanced connectivity with DLPFC in improving self-regulation following LSG requires further investigation.
