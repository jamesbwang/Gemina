  To analyze the national treatment trends of patients diagnosed with benign intracranial meningioma. Data was obtained from the National Cancer Database ( NCDB) for patients with WHO grade I meningioma tumors between 2004 and 2014 ( 190,527 patients) , diagnosed by either surgical specimen or diagnostic imaging. Univariable and multivariable analyses ( binary logistic models) were performed to generate odds ratios ( OR) and investigate factors associated with definitive initial treatment compared to initial observation. Initial treatments considered included surgical resection and/or radiation , including either fractionated external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS). The rate of observation increased over time , from 37 % in 2004 to 55 % in 2014 ( p < 0.001). Conjointly , the rate of resection decreased from 50 % to 37 % from 2004 to 2014 ( p < 0.001). The utilization of radiotherapy , including SRS , remained generally stable over time at 6 % or less. SRS was more frequently utilized , compared to EBRT , as definitive treatment ( 4.6 % versus 1.7 % , respectively , p < 0.001). Compared to Community Cancer programs , patients at Academic/Research programs were more likely to receive definitive initial treatment over observation ( OR = 2.909 , each p < 0.001). There is a national trend favoring initial observation for radiographically diagnosed WHO grade I meningioma. However , patients presenting to academic facilities are more likely to receive definitive initial treatment. Further research into differing approaches among treatment facilities for this common tumor may help clarify this trend.
