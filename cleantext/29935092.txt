  The effect of short-chain inulin on the rheological and sensory properties of reduced fat set coconut milk yoghurt was studied with whole fat coconut milk yoghurt as reference. The concentration of short-chain inulin was varied at 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 % w/v respectively. All the yoghurt samples displayed higher elastic modulus G ' than viscous modulus G ''. However , 15 % inulin yoghurt had the highest value for G ' & G ''. The 15 and 20 % inulin yoghurts displayed high yield stress ( 1036.7 ± 2.39 & 368.23 ± 0.30 Pa). Addition threshold of 15 % was established , beyond this level there was a significant decrease in the yield stress , firmness , cohesiveness and consistency values of the reduced fat yoghurts. Using Pearson correlation analysis , no correlation was observed between firmness and yield stress , Similarly , there was significant correlation between the yield stress and instrumental viscosity r = 0.957; p < 0.01. Furthermore , all yoghurt samples displayed strain thinning behavior except whole fat yoghurt. Carbohydrate was affected by inulin incorporation. Addition of short chain inulin improved sensorial characteristics such as taste , and flavor , but did not display significant difference in color and odor of yoghurt samples.
