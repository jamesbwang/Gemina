  Lung squamous cell carcinoma ( LSCC) is a common type of non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) and lacks effective treatment. Regorafenib , an oral multikinase inhibitor , has demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in various solid tumors. To study whether regorafenib inhibits LSCC cells , we investigate the compound in several LSCC cell lines and explore the possible mechanism. In this study , we confirmed that regorafenib had anti-proliferation effect on LSCC cell lines by inducing G0/G1 arrest. In addition , glycogen synthase kinase 3β ( GSK3β) remained at the same level and Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β decreased with increasing incubation time and increasing regorafenib concentration in LSCC cells. GSK3β inhibition enhanced the anti-tumor activity of regorafenib. Thus , GSK3β activation restricted the anti-cancer effect of regorafenib on LSCC. In conclusion , regorafenib might be a promising drug for LSCC therapy. GSK3β might be a potential target to increase the anti-tumor effect of regorafenib in LSCC cells.
