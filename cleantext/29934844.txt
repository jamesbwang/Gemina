  Cancer is developed by rapid , uncontrolled , and abnormal cell proliferation and one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide in human beings. For the remedial measures of preventing different types of cancers , one of the research domains that have gained substantial importance in medical science is the development of new metallo-drugs and their investigations as potential anticancer drug agents by using various analytical techniques. Since metal-based complexes show weak absorption bands , electrochemical methods are considered more feasible and preferable over spectroscopic methods for easy characterization. Due to closer resemblance of electrochemical and biological processes , cyclic voltammetry among different electrochemical methods is considered the most versatile for the study of in-vitro metal-based drug-DNA interactions in terms of changes in the redox activities. Current potential data of a metal complex leads to determine binding kinetics in terms of binding constant and binding site size that involve determining the binding mode of drug with DNA , i.e. , electrostatic interactions , intercalation , or minor-major groove binding. Binding parameters and modes of interactions , further , help to develop the mechanism of action of drug with the DNA. In this review , we emphasize on cyclic voltammetric DNA binding studies on some metal complexes that have been carried out in the last three decades for the investigation of their anticancer potentials.
