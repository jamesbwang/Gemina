  To study the feasibility of cardiovascular disease risk factor ( CVDRF) screening at an HIV<pathogen> clinic in Swaziland. A sample of HIV-positive patients at least 40 years on antiretroviral treatment was screened for hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidemia , and tobacco smoking. A total of 1826 patients were screened; 684 ( 39 %) had at least one CVDRF. Screening volume varied markedly , and was limited by staffing , space , and supplies. CVDRF screening was feasible and prevalence of risk factors in people living with HIV<pathogen> at least 40 years was high.
