  Aside from the ability of plants to remove domestic-industrial wastewater contaminants from various types of water , macrophytes can also serve as an alternative source of energy. The goal of the present study was to test the viability of biogas production using aquatic macrophyte species-Eichhornia crassipes<pathogen> and Pistia stratiotes-contaminated with cadmium ( Cd) after the phytoremediation process. The plants were transferred to a nutrient solution contaminated with 0.8 mg L
