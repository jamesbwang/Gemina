  The use of Monte Carlo ( MC) simulations remains a powerful tool to study the biological effects induced by ionizing radiation on living beings. Several MC codes are commonly used in research fields such as nanodosimetry , radiotherapy , radiation protection , and space radiation. This work presents an enhancement of an existing model ( 1) for radiobiological purposes , to account for the indirect DNA damage induced by ionizing particles. The Geant4-DNA simulation toolkit was used to simulate the physical , pre-chemical , and chemical stages of early DNA damage induced by protons and Î±-particles. Liquid water was used as the medium for simulations. Two phase-space files were generated , one containing the energy deposition events and another with the position of chemical species produced by water radiolysis from 0.1 ps up to 1 ns. These files were used as input in the radiobiological code that contains the genetic material model with atomic resolution , consisting of several copies of 30 nm chromatin fibers. The B-DNA configuration was used. This work focused on the indirect damage produced by the hydroxyl radical ( OH) attack on the sugar-phosphate group. The approach followed to account for the indirect DNA damage was the same as those used by other radiobiological codes ( 2,3). The critical parameter considered here was the reaction radius , which was calculated from the Smoluchowski 's diffusion equation. Single , double , and total strand break yields produced by direct , indirect , and mixed mechanisms are reported. The obtained results are consistent with experimental and calculation data sets published in the literature.
