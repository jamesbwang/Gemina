  In Asian countries , breast densities and the proportion of younger women with breast cancer are higher than those in Western countries. This study was designed to determine differences in stage at diagnosis of breast cancer among Korean women according to screening history. The study population was derived from the Korea National Cancer Screening Program ( KNCSP). The study cohort comprised 17,689 women who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 and were invited to undergo breast cancer screening via the KNCSP between 2002 and 2011. Ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS) and localized breast cancer were most frequent in both ever-screened and never-screened patients. Late stage cancer was significantly more frequent in never-screened patients , compared with ever-screened patients. Compared to never-screened women , the odds ratio ( OR) for being diagnosed with early stage breast cancer among screened women was 1.41 ( 95 % Confidence Interval ( CI) = 1.28-1.55). The OR for being diagnosed with early stage breast cancer was highest among patients who underwent screening three times or more ( aOR = 1.89 , 95 % CI = 1.57-2.29). Screening by mammography was associated with diagnosis of early stage breast cancer in Korean women. However , significant increases in the diagnosis of DCIS and localized breast cancers among ever-screened patients suggest the possibility of overdiagnosis due to screening.
