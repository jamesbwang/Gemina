  Causes of peritoneal carcinomatosis ( PC) in patients with a history of breast carcinoma include both metastatic breast carcinoma ( MBC) and primary peritoneal/ovarian carcinoma ( PPOC). The origin of PC is important to determine the appropriate treatment strategy. Cytological examination of the peritoneal fluid ( PF) , which may be the first diagnostic approach to PC , is of distinct value in confirming the presence of malignant cells and determining the origin of PC. We analyzed the clinicopathological and cytomorphological characteristics of 33 patients with a history of breast carcinoma whose PF cytology contained malignant cells. Cases showing positive immunoreactivity for PAX8 and a lack of GATA3 expression were considered as PPOC. Sixteen patients developed PC caused by PPOC. PPOC patients were characterized by early-stage primary breast carcinoma , absence of non-peritoneal MBC before PC , and normal serum levels of CEA and CA15-3. Fourteen PPOC patients had pathogenic germline BRCA mutations. Cytological examination revealed that most of the PPOC cases had a dominant papillary arrangement of the tumor cells with severe nuclear pleomorphism , occasional bizarre nuclei , and atypical mitotic figures. Patients with PPOC who underwent cytoreductive surgery had a significantly longer survival time compared to those who did not , or MBC patients. In patients with a history of breast carcinoma presenting with PC , the presence of early-stage primary breast carcinoma , no prior non-peritoneal MBC , and a dominant papillary cellular arrangement pattern in the PF cytology were independent predictors of PPOC. Cytoreductive surgery significantly improved survival for patients with PPOC.
