  Toll-like receptors ( TLRs) of the human immune mechanism play important role in the detection of invading pathogens. TLRs specifically recognize the pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs) from pathogens and start the effective response. Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) in the TLRs can mediate their functions. Present study evaluated the importance of rs4986790 polymorphism of Blood samples of 228 malaria<disease> patients and 226 healthy volunteers were selected for the study. Sample collection was completed during Sep 2013 to Sep 2015 from different hospitals of Punjab , Pakistan. Patient 's samples were divided into Results indicate the protective role of AA genotype against the susceptibility of rs4986790 polymorphism of
