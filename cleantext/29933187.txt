  In this study , the effect of pre-treatments including alkaline , acid and hydrogen peroxide on continuous hydrogen and methane production was investigated. Two different substrates as potatoes and bean wastes were used. Pre-treatment showed positive effect on bio-hydrogen and bio-methane production; higher bio-hydrogen and bio-methane production results using pre-treated samples than the control bioreactors ( without pre-treatment) , were recorded. In case of potatoes wastes , the hydrogen yield ranged between 126.4 and 252.7 mL-H
