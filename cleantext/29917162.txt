  The N-terminal domain ( NTD) of nuclear human uracil DNA glycosylase ( hUNG2) assists in targeting hUNG2 to replication forks through specific interactions with replication protein A ( RPA). Here , we explored hUNG2 activity in the presence and absence of RPA using substrates with ssDNA-dsDNA junctions that mimic structural features of the replication fork and transcriptional R-loops. We find that when RPA is tightly bound to the ssDNA<pathogen> overhang of junction DNA substrates , base excision by hUNG2 is strongly biased toward uracils located 21 bp or less from the ssDNA-dsDNA junction. In the absence of RPA , hUNG2 still showed an 8-fold excision bias for uracil located < 10 bp from the junction , but only when the overhang had a 5 ' end. Biased targeting required the NTD and was not observed with the hUNG2 catalytic domain alone. Consistent with this requirement , the isolated NTD was found to bind weakly to ssDNA<pathogen>. These findings indicate that the NTD of hUNG2 targets the enzyme to ssDNA-dsDNA junctions using RPA-dependent and RPA-independent mechanisms. This structure-based specificity may promote efficient removal of uracils that arise from dUTP incorporation during DNA replication , or additionally , uracils that arise from DNA cytidine deamination at transcriptional R-loops during immunoglobulin class-switch recombination.
