  To identify health and physiological measures , depressive symptoms and locus of control ( LOC) in adherence to a low salt ( 1,500 mg sodium) , diet in African American ( AA) adults with hypertension ( HTN). Adherence determinants to self-management behaviours among AA adults with HTN is essential in prevention of outcomes such as stroke. A low-salt diet is one key factor in the successful management of HTN. A cross-sectional correlational design. Systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , co-morbidities , serum creatinine , potassium , education , depression<symptom> , LOC and social support were examined in relationship to self-reported adherence to a low-salt diet in a sample of AA adults ( N = 77) aged 55-84. Demographic and physiologic data were collected in addition to diet adherence on a 100 mm visual analog scale. Standardised tools included Multidimensional Health LOC scale and the Patient Health Question-9 Depression<symptom> Instrument. Lower adherence to a low-salt diet was more prevalent in females ( n = 27; 73 %). A moderate negative correlation ( r = -0.294; p < 0.01) was found with low-salt diet adherence in the PHQ-9 ( r = -0.294; p < 0.01). Both multiple regression , models significantly influenced adherence to low salt diet , with both models explaining 24 % of the variance; internal LOC ( F = 2.599 ( 8 , 68); p = 0.02) and external LOC ( F = 2.667 ( 8 , 68); p = 0.013). Increasing awareness of factors affecting adherence to a low-salt diet is important for clinicians for effective management of HTN in AA adults. Nurses are encouraged to adopt a comprehensive assessment of those with HTN to identify psychosocial needs , in particular depressive symptoms , as a potential secondary prevention measure.
