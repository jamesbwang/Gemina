  Phosphodiesterases ( PDEs) are a superfamily of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds of 3 ' ,5 ' cyclic adenosine and guanosine monophosphate ( cAMP and cGMP). PDEs control hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotides in many cells and tissues. Inhibition of PDEs by selective or nonselective PDE inhibitors represents an effective targeted strategy for the treatment of various diseases including respiratory disorders. Recent data have demonstrated that PDE inhibitors can also be of benefit in respiratory distress in neonates. This article outlines the pharmacological properties of nonselective and selective PDE inhibitors and provides up-to-date information regarding their use in experimental models of neonatal respiratory distress as well as in clinical studies.
