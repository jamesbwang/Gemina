  The introduction into clinical practice of contrast-enhanced ultrasonographic examination made it possible to assess patency of tibial arteries and perfusion of crural muscles in patients with occlusive lesions<symptom> of lower-limb arteries. These findings are important for planning optimal treatment policy and assessing efficacy of operative or medicamentous treatment. The study was aimed at investigating a possibility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination for assessment of patency of tibial arteries and quantitative assessment of perfusion of crural muscles in patient with occlusive lesions<symptom> of lower-limb arteries. We examined a total of 30 patients presenting with atherosclerotic-genesis occlusive lesions<symptom> of lower limb arteries and symptomatic intermittent claudication. Five patients were examined in the postoperative period. All patients were subjected to quantitative analysis of crural muscle perfusion in the pre- and postoperative periods , determining the time of onset of contrast medium accumulation and the time to the peak of intensity. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination demonstrated that in patients with occlusive lesions<symptom> of lower-limb arteries the start of contrast medium accumulation appeared to occur later than in apparently healthy people: on second 30-88 , depending on the degree of limb ischaemia. The contrasting time-to-peak was also increased ( from 36 to 120 s). In the postoperative period all patients were found to have improved perfusion of the crural muscles , which was confirmed by a decrease in time-to-peak contrasting. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonographic examination is currently the only non-invasive , safe method of determining perfusion of crural muscles , which may be used many times for assessment of viability of the ischaemised extremity , as well as for assessment of efficacy of the treatment performed.
