  We report the synthesis and the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of six mononuclear iridium ( iii) and ruthenium ( ii) complexes bearing S , S '- extended phenanthroline ligands. Starting from 5,6-dibromide-1,10-phenanthroline , the dithiine derivatives N , N ' -1,10-phenanthrolinedithiino ( 2,3-b) quinoxaline and N , N ' -1,10-phenanthrolinedithiino ( 2,3-b) benzene were prepared by primary N , N '- complexation of the dibromo derivative and subsequent nucleophilic substitution at the complex. The photoluminescence of the phenanthroline-dithiine containing complexes shows distinctively increased lifetimes for all Ir ( iii) and Ru ( ii) complexes. The activity of the series of Ir ( iii) and Ru ( ii) complexes as photosensitizers in visible-light photocatalytic water reduction is demonstrated by dihydrogen evolution with a ( Fe3 ( CO) 12) catalyst and triethylamine as a sacrificial donor.
