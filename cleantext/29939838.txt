  Purpose To update evidence-based guideline recommendations for practicing oncologists and others on systemic therapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2)- positive advanced breast cancer to 2018. Methods An Expert Panel conducted a targeted systematic literature review ( for both systemic treatment and CNS metastases) and identified 622 articles. Outcomes of interest included overall survival , progression-free survival , and adverse events. Results Of the 622 publications identified and reviewed , no additional evidence was identified that would warrant a change to the 2014 recommendations. Recommendations HER2-targeted therapy is recommended for patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer , except for those with clinical congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> or significantly compromised left ventricular ejection fraction , who should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Trastuzumab , pertuzumab , and taxane for first-line treatment and trastuzumab emtansine for second-line treatment are recommended. In the third-line setting , clinicians should offer other HER2-targeted therapy combinations or trastuzumab emtansine ( if not previously administered) and may offer pertuzumab if the patient has not previously received it. Optimal duration of chemotherapy is at least 4 to 6 months or until maximum response , depending on toxicity and in the absence of progression. HER2-targeted therapy can continue until time of progression or unacceptable toxicities. For patients with HER2-positive and estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer , clinicians may recommend either standard first-line therapy or , for selected patients , endocrine therapy plus HER2-targeted therapy or endocrine therapy alone.
