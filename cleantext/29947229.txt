  Industrial facilities can be point sources of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ( PFASs) emission to the surrounding environment. In this study , 25 neutral and ionizable PFASs were analyzed in 94 multimedia samples including air , rain , outdoor settled dust , soil , plant leaves , river water , surface sediment , and shallow groundwater from two fluorochemical manufacturing parks ( FMPs) in Fuxin , China , to elucidate the multimedia distribution and transfer pattern of PFASs from a point source. The concentrations of individual PFASs in air , outdoor settled dust , and surface river water decreased exponentially as the distance increases from the FMPs , whereas the concentrations of short-chain ( C2-C4) perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids ( PFCAs) remained high ( 3000 ng/L) in the surface water 38 km away. At FMPs , air concentrations of fluorotelomer alcohols and iodides were found dominant with levels of up to 7900 pg/m
