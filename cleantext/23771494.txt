  Several glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are administered as weekly injections for treatment of type 2 diabetes ( T2D). These medications vary in their injection processes , and a recent study in the UK found that these differences had an impact on patient preference and health state utilities. The purpose of this study was to replicate the UK study in Italy to examine preferences of an Italian patient sample , while allowing for comparison between utilities in the UK and Italy. Participants with T2D in Italy valued health states in time trade-off interviews. All health states had the same description of T2D , but differed in description of the treatment process. As in the original UK study , the first health state described an oral treatment regimen , while additional health states added a weekly injection. The injection health states differed in three injection-related attributes: requirements for reconstituting the medication , waiting during medication preparation , and needle handling. Interviews were completed by 238 patients ( 58.8 % male; mean age = 60.2 years; 118 from Milan , 120 from Rome). The oral treatment health state had a mean ( SD) utility of 0.90 ( 0.10). The injection health states had significantly ( Disutilities associated with the injection device characteristics were similar to those reported with the UK sample. Results suggest that injection device attributes may be important to some patients with T2D , and it may be useful for clinicians to consider these attributes when choosing medication for patients initiating these weekly treatments.
