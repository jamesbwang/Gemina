  The management of posterior deep endometriosis is not consensual. This is due to a great heterogeneity of data from the literature. Many series were small and overall , predictors of pregnancy were not all included and analyzed by multivariate analysis. We conducted this study to evaluate the factors associated with pregnancy during the first two in vitro fertilization ( IVF) attempts in infertile women with posterior deep endometriosis. 230 women were included in this retrospective observational study , between January 1th , 2007 and September 30th , 2013 , at the University Hospital of Lille. A large set of variables were recorded and their association with the chance of pregnancy was analysed by multivariate analysis ( MVA) , including patients ' features , endometriosis items , surgery procedures and IVF data. After 2 IVF attempts , 48.7 % of the 230 women achieved a pregnancy , including 39.1 % of ongoing pregnancies. Logistic regression analysis retained five variables significantly associated to the chance of pregnancy: oocyte retrieval number ( OR = 0.468 ( 0.296-0.739) p = 0.001) , age ( OR = 0.888 ( 0.811-0.974) p = 0.011) , single embryo transfer number ( OR = 1.494 ( 1.036-2.153) p = 0.031) , presence of a recto-uterine nodule<disease> ( OR = 0.454 ( 0.235-0.877) p = 0.019) and IVF technique ( OR = 0.509 ( 0.272-0.951) p = 0.034). The presence of a recto uterine nodule<disease> is associated with a lower chance of pregnancy after IVF. It has to be checked by prospective studies whether the finding of a recto-uterine nodule<disease> whose pejorative effect has not been reported so far should encourage to perform surgery before IVF in patients with deep endometriosis.
