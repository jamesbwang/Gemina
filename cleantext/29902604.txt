  The anterior clinoidal meningiomas often engulf/ encase or compress Internal Carotid artery ( ICA) and its branches , Optic nerve ( ON) and structures passing through superior orbital fissure ( SOF). The trans-sylvain route of excising tumour poses a difficulty in exposing and safeguarding encased vessels. In addition , it may jeopardize the bulging brain and stretched veins , especially in large tumors. The objective is to present an operative video to demonstrate the technique of ` centrifugal opening ' and removal of anterior clinoidal meningiomas. The ICA , Optic nerve and Superior orbital fissure are exposed after extradural anterior clinoidectomy. The dural base is devascularized and incised radially , cuts starting proximally from these neurovascular structures. The tumor is then debulked and removed by tracing these structures from proximal to distal. The arachnoid and veins are preserved. Early identification of ICA , ON and SOF gives a better control and allow preservation of these structures despite their engulfment , encasement or compression. The perforators and arteries are skeletonized in a step wise manner to achieve maximal safe resection. Even with brain edema<symptom> , the arachnoid and adjacent veins can be preserved. The technique was used by the authors in over 15 cases with good outcome. Thus , the discussed technique imparts a better control of neurovascular structure with minimal handling of adjacent brain and veins thereby allowing a more aggressive resection.
