  Objective To investigate trends in breast cancer mortality in New Zealand women , to corroborate or negate a causal association with service screening mammography. Method Cumulated mortality rates from breast cancer deaths individually linked to incident cases diagnosed before and after screening commencement were compared , in women aged 50-64 ( from 2001) and aged 45-49 and 65-69 ( from 2006). Trends and differences in aggregate invasive breast cancer mortality ( 1975-2013) were assessed in relation to introduction of mammography screening targeting women aged 50-64 and 45-69. Joinpoint analysis was also undertaken. Results The reduction in incidence-based cumulated breast cancer mortality before and after the introduction of screening was -15 % ( p = 0.006) for women aged 45-69 , and 17 % ( p = 0.005) for those aged 50-64. Aggregate mortality declined by -34 % ( 2005-13 compared with 1992-98) in the age group 50-64 , and by -28 % among women aged 45-49 and -25 % among women aged 65-74. For women aged 50-64 the 2-joinpoint model shows a 1990 turning point , from prior rising mortality to a mean -1.8 % decline per annum , coinciding with improvements in primary treatment of breast cancer; and a steepening of the decline ( -3.0 % p.a.) from the late 1990s , coinciding with the introduction of service mammography screening. Conclusion Breast cancer mortality declines occurring since the advent of screening mammography in New Zealand are consistent with other incidence-based and aggregate studies of screening mammography in populations , individual-based cohort studies , and randomized controlled trials.
