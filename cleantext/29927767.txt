  The purpose of this article is to identify practical issues in implementing a culturally tailored technology-based intervention among Asian American survivors of breast cancer. In a large-scale technology-based breast cancer intervention study , research team members wrote memos on issues in implementing a culturally tailored technology-based intervention and plausible reasons for the issues. Then , the content of the research diaries was analyzed , along with written records of the research team. The practical issues found in the research process included those related to ( 1) technology literacy and preferences; ( 2) language issues; ( 3) cultural attitudes , beliefs , and values; ( 4) intervention staff competence; ( 5) security and confidentiality issues; and ( 6) time and geographical constraints. Based on the issues , several recommendations are proposed for future research using culturally tailored technology-based interventions among racial and ethnic minorities.
