  The Pacific Island region is geographically the most isolated region in the world representing a diverse population of indigenous peoples , migrated groups and new-comers. Rates of chronic<disease> disease<disease> are predominately high in populations identified as Pacific Islander. The practice of dietetics , defined as nutrition education for the prevention of disease and medical nutrition therapy for the treatment of chronic<disease> diseases<disease> , proves challenging with the unique cultural diversity in the region. There is a need to describe dietetics practice , populations served , and needs for resources identified by nutrition-related topic and cultural relevance for Registered Dietitian Nutritionists in the Pacific Island region. An online survey was distributed to all members of the Hawai'i Affiliate of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in 2013-2014. The online survey yielded 104 usable responses. Most participants were female and lived and worked in the Hawaiian Island region. One-third of practicing Registered Dietitian Nutritionists saw > 100 patients or clients per month. Most prevalent populations served were identified as Asian and Pacific Islanders. Culturally relevant resources of the highest need were relevant to Asian and Pacific Islander cultures , specifically addressing weight control and diabetes. Dietetics practice in the Pacific Island region is unique given the prevalence of Asians and Pacific Islanders served by Registered Dietitian Nutritionists. Findings will inform the development of new , culturally appropriate online nutrition resources , to enhance dietetics practice in the region. Making these resources available online will be useful for Registered Dietitian Nutritionists and other health care practitioners working in the Pacific Island region.
