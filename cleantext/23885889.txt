  Non Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer ( NMIBC) is among the most frequent malignant cancers worldwide. NMIBC is treated by transurethral resection of the bladder tumor ( TURBT) and intravesical therapies , and has the highest recurrence rate among solid tumors. It requires a lifelong patient monitoring based on repeated cystoscopy and urinary cytology , both having drawbacks that include lack of sensitivity and specificity , invasiveness and care costs. We conducted an investigative clinical study to examine changes in the urinary metabolome of NMBIC patients before and after TURBT , as well during the subsequent surveillance period. Adjusting by prior probability of recurrence per risk , discriminant analysis of UPLC-MS metabolic profiles , displayed negative predictive values for low , low-intermediate , high-intermediate and high risk patient groups of 96.5 % , 94.0 % , 92.9 % and 76.1 % respectively. Detailed analysis of the metabolome revealed several candidate metabolites and perturbed phenylalanine , arginine , proline and tryptophan metabolisms as putative biomarkers. A pilot retrospective analysis of longitudinal trajectories of a BC metabolic biomarkers during post TURBT surveillance was carried out and the results give strong support for the clinical use of metabolomic profiling in assessing NMIBC recurrence.
