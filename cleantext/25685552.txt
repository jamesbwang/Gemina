  Primary malignancies of the female urethra are rare , accounting for less than 1 % of genitourinary malignancies. Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the urethra ( CCAU) occurs more infrequently , accounting for 0.003 % of malignancies of the female urogenital tract. Definitive clinical diagnosis of CCAU is difficult and must be differentiated from tumors of the vagina. Currently , there is limited understanding of the causes of CCAU and there is no established standard of care for treatment. Immunohistochemistry and pathologic analysis can be used to identify the origin of the tumor.
