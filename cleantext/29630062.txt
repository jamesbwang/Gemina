  Single molecule localization microscopy can generate 3D super-resolution images without scanning by leveraging the axial variations of normal or engineered point spread functions ( PSF). Successful implementation of these approaches for extended axial ranges remains , however , challenging. We present Zernike Optimized Localization Approach in 3D ( ZOLA-3D) , an easy-to-use computational and optical solution that achieves optimal resolution over a tunable axial range. We use ZOLA-3D to demonstrate 3D super-resolution imaging of mitochondria , nuclear pores and microtubules in entire nuclei or cells up to ~ 5 Î¼m deep.
