  The feasibility of utilizing the cell surface chemokine receptor CXCR4 for human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HIV<pathogen>) entry inhibition and as an intracellular portal for targeted drug delivery was evaluated. Novel DV3 ligands ( 1DV3 , 2DV3 , and 4DV3) were designed , synthesized and conjugated to various probes ( fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC) or biotin) and cargos with sizes ranging from 10 to 50 nm ( polyethylene glycol ( PEG) , streptavidin , and a polymeric nanoparticle). 4DV3 conjugated probes inhibited HIV-1 entry into the CXCR4-expressing reporter cell line TZM-bl ( IC
