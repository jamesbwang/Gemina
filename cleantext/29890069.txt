  Antibiotic resistance has become increasingly prevalent over the past few decades , and this combined with a dearth in the development of new classes of antibiotics to treat multidrug resistant Gram-negative infections has led to a significant global health problem and the increased usage of colistin as the last resort antibiotic. Colistin , however , presents dose dependent toxicity in the clinic. One potential approach to combatting this problem is the use of an antibiotic adjuvant , a compound that is nontoxic to the bacteria that enhances the potency of colistin and ultimately allows for reducing dosing. Herein , we present a new urea-containing class of 2-aminoimidazole-based adjuvants that potentiates colistin activity against colistin-sensitive Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> Lead compounds enabled 1000-fold reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentration of colistin in vitro and showed efficacy in a Galleria mellonella infection model , representing the first step toward validating the potential of employing these adjuvants to lower colistin dosage.
