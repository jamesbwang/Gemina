  To describe the age-standardized average intake of dietary sodium in Chinese adults of 18 years old and over in 2010-2012. Data was from the China Nutrition and Health Surveillance in 2010-2012. A stratified multistage cluster sampling was used from 31 provinces ( autonomous regions and municipalities) and selected 150 districts/counties. The sample was selected through the method of probability proportion to size ( PPS). The sample participants were adults aged 18 and over. The average sodium intake was calculated based on dietary data collected using the method of 3 consecutive day edible oil and seasonings weighting and 3 days 24-hour dietary recall. The result were calculated using the complex weight based on national census from the National Bureau of Statistics in 2009. The mean intake of sodium was ( 5335. 7 ± 95. 3) mg/d and it was higher for men ( ( 5744. 9 ± 117. 8) mg/d) than for women ( ( 4918. 9 ± 79. 4) mg/d). The age groups of 40-49 ( ( 5602. 3 ± 152. 7) mg/d) , 50-59 ( ( 5640. 0 ± 113. 8) mg/d) and 60-69 ( ( 5363. 5 ± 100. 8) mg/d) had higher sodium intake than those of other age groups. The sodium intake among the adults in rural ( ( 5352. 3 ± 121. 7) mg/d) area was similar with that of urban ( ( 5319. 5 ± 145. 9) mg/d). Overall , the mean intake of sodium in medium and small cities ( ( 5378. 4 ± 170. 3) mg/d) , general rural ( ( 5369. 8 ± 142. 7) mg/d) and poor rural areas ( ( 5335. 9 ± 231. 6) mg/d) was similar while big city was lowest ( ( 4993. 8 ± 150. 3) mg/d). In2010-2012 , the mean sodium intake among Chinese adults was still in a very high level. It was necessary to monitor the population sodium intakes and the strategies should be developed to reduce national salt/sodium intakes.
