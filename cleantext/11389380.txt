  Stab-wound injuries to the spinal cord are rare and currently , do not have a well-established management in the literature despite its strong association with neurological injury. We report a case of a patient with a stab-wound injury with a knife in the lumbar region , who underwent direct removal in the operating room without surgical exploration. Upon admission , the patient had no neurological deficit. The X-rays and CT scan before removal showed the involvement of > 50 % of the intramedullary canal at L2. The removal was performed in the operating room with a surgical team available and ready in case there was neurological deterioration during the procedure. We concluded that any neurologic deficit in a patient with a stab-wound injury in the spine must mandate surgical exploration and in patients without neurological deficit , direct removal of the stabbing object is a safe and effective method without adding the risks of a surgical exploration.
