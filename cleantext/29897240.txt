  Duplication of a single β-strand that forms part of a β-sheet in photoactive yellow protein ( PYP) was found to produce two approximately isoenergetic protein conformations , in which either the first or the second copy of the duplicated β-strand participates in the β-sheet. Whereas one conformation ( big-loop) is more stable at equilibrium in the dark , the other conformation ( long-tail) is populated after recovery from blue light irradiation. By appending a recognition motif ( E-helix) to the C-terminus of the protein , we show that β-strand duplication , and the resulting possibility of β-strand slippage , can lead to a new switchable protein-protein interaction. We suggest that β-strand duplication may be a general means of introducing two-state switching activity into protein structures.
