  The halophytes have evolved several strategies to survive in saline environments; however , an additional support from their associated microbiota helps combat adverse conditions. Hence , our driving interests to investigate the endophytic bacterial community richness , diversity , and composition associated to roots of Salicornia europaea<pathogen> from two test sites with different origins of soil salinity. We assumed that salinity will have a negative effect on the diversity of endophytes but simultaneously will permit the high occurrence of halophylic bacteria. Further , to establish the role of the host and its external environment in determining the endophytic diversity , we analyzed the physico-chemical parameters of root zone soil and the concentration of salt ions in the plant roots. The results based on the Miseq Illumina sequencing approach revealed a higher number of endophytic bacterial OTUs at naturally saline test site with a higher level of soil salinity. Proteobacteria and Bacteriodetes were the dominant endophytic phyla at both analyzed sites; additionally , the high occurrence of Planctomycetes and Acidobacteria at more saline site and the occurrence of Firmicutes , Actinobacteria , and Chloroflexi at less saline site were recorded. The salinity in the root zone soil was crucial in structuring the endophytic community of S. europaea<pathogen> , and the significant prevalence of representatives from the phyla Deltaproteobacteria , Acidobacteria , Caldithrix , Fibrobacteres , and Verrucomicrobia at the more saline test site suggest domination of halophylic bacteria with potential role in mitigation of salt stress of halophytes.
