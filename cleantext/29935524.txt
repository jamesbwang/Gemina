  Water in the subcritical and supercritical states has remarkable properties that make it an excellent solvent for oxidation of hazardous chemicals , waste separation , and green synthesis. Molecular simulations are a valuable complement to experiments in order to understand and improve the relevant sub- and super-critical reaction mechanisms. Since water molecules under these conditions can act not only as a solvent but also as a reactant , dissociative force fields are especially interesting to investigate these processes. In this work , we evaluate the capacity of the ReaxFF force field to reproduce the microstructure , hydrogen bonding , dielectric constant , diffusion , and proton transfer of sub- and super-critical water. Our results indicate that ReaxFF is able to simulate water properties in these states in very good quantitative agreement with the existing experimental data , with the exception of the static dielectric constant that is reproduced only qualitatively.
