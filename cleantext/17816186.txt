  Soil salinization is a major factor limiting crop growth and development in many areas. Switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum L.) is an important warm-season grass species used for biofuel production. The objective of this study was to investigate antioxidant metabolism , proline , and protein variation associated with alkali-salt tolerance among 30 switchgrass lines and identify metabolic markers for evaluating alkali-salt tolerance of switchgrass lines. The grass lines were transplanted into plastic pots containing fine sand. When the plants reached E5 developmental stage , they were subjected to either alkali-salt stress treatment ( 150 mM Na + and pH of 9.5) or control ( no alkali-salt stress) for 20 d. The 30 switchgrass lines differed in alkali-salt tolerance as determined by the level of leaf malondialdehyde ( MDA) , antioxidant enzyme activity ( ( superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , catalase ( CAT) , ascorbate peroxidase ( APX)) , proline and protein. Alkali-salt stress increased MDA , proline , SOD , reduced CAT activity , but its effect on protein and APX varied depending on lines. Wide variations in the five parameters existed among the 30 lines. In general , the lines with higher CAT activity and lower proline content under alkali-salt stress had less MDA , exhibiting better alkali-salt tolerance. Among the five parameters , CAT can be considered as valuable metabolic markers for assessment of switchgrass tolerance to alkali-salt stress.
