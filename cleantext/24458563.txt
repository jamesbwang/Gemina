  ʟ-Ornithine is an important amino acid with broad applications in pharmaceutical and food industries. Despite lagging ʟ-ornithine productivity and cost reduction , microbial fermentation is a promising route for sustainable ʟ-ornithine production and thus development of robust microbial strains with high stability and productivity is essential. Previously , we systematically developed a new strain , SO1 originate from Corynebacterium<pathogen> glutamicum S9114 , for ʟ-ornithine production. In this work , overexpression of cg3035 encoding N-acetylglutamate synthase ( NAGS) using a plasmid or by inserting a strong P These results clearly demonstrated that enhancing the expression of NAGS promoted ʟ-ornithine production and provide a promising alternative systematic blueprint for developing ʟ-ornithine-producing C. glutamicum strains.
