  The aim of this study has been to evaluate the physical , psychological , and social well-being in a large group of Sardinian adult patients with transfusion-dependent beta-Thalassemia when compared with a group of healthy subjects of the same age and geographical extraction. Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age with Thalassemia major on regular transfusion at Thalassemia Center in Cagliari ( Italy) were requested to complete the World Health Organization Quality of life-BREF ( WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. The WHOQOL-BREF was also made available online to age- and sex-matched non-thalassemic adult subjects living in Sardinia. Two hundred and seven subjects with Thalassemia were invited to participate in the study. The questionnaire was also completed by 211 age- and sex-matched non-thalassemic subjects living in Sardinia. Scores suggestive of a good quality of life were obtained in all the areas investigated. Thalassemia patients had scores at least as good as those of non-thalassemic subjects in all items and the percentage of those with a score ≥ 60 was higher among patients. The analysis of demographic actually highlights that the disease has a little effect on their personal and social lives. There was a positive association between subjective well-being and effective clinical conditions. Moreover , the association between health perception and adherence to treatment suggests that compliance with treatment contributes to the well-being of the patient , both physically and psychologically. Adult subjects with Thalassemia who live in Western countries have a good quality of life in accordance with the advances in the management of the disease.
