  The activation and expansion of bipotent liver progenitor cells ( LPCs) are indispensable for liver regeneration after severe or chronic liver injury. However , the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating LPCs and LPC-mediated liver regeneration remain elusive. Hepatic brain-expressed X-linked 1 ( BEX1) expression was evaluated using microarray screening , real-time polymerase chain reaction , immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. LPC activation and liver injury were studied following a choline-deficient , ethionine-supplemented ( CDE) diet in wild-type ( WT) and Bex1 Hepatic BEX1 expression was increased during CDE diet-induced liver injury and was highly elevated primarily in LPCs. Bex1 Our findings indicate that BEX1 plays a pivotal role in LPC activation and expansion during liver regeneration , potentially providing novel targets for liver regeneration and chronic liver disease therapies.
