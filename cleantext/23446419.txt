  Cell size uniformity in healthy tissues suggests that control mechanisms might coordinate cell growth and division. We derived a method to assay whether cellular growth rates depend on cell size , by monitoring how variance in size changes as cells grow. Our data revealed that , twice during the cell cycle , growth rates are selectively increased in small cells and reduced in large cells , ensuring cell size uniformity. This regulation was also observed directly by monitoring nuclear growth in live cells. We also detected cell-size-dependent adjustments of G1 length , which further reduce variability. Combining our assays with chemical/genetic perturbations confirmed that cells employ two strategies , adjusting both cell cycle length and growth rate , to maintain the appropriate size. Additionally , although Rb signaling is not required for these regulatory behaviors , perturbing Cdk4 activity still influences cell size , suggesting that the Cdk4 pathway may play a role in designating the cell 's target size.
