  We used a suture-and-open technique with a biatrial incision for primary sutureless repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection ( TAPVC). With this technique , the common pulmonary venous sinus and its branching pulmonary veins are opened after completion of suturing of the left atrial incision to the pericardium around the common pulmonary venous sinus and its branching veins. The technique allows the primary sutureless repair of TAPVC to be done in a less bloody field under full-flow cardiopulmonary bypass. We have performed this technique in our recent 5 consecutive TAPVC patients without significant complications.
