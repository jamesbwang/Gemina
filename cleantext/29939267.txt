  ` Last-line ' antimicrobial usage has promoted the emergence of MDR bacteria. Production of Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> carbapenemases ( KPCs) is increasingly common and leads to resistance to most antimicrobials. However , ceftazidime/avibactam demonstrates activity against KPC-producing strains. Ceftazidime/avibactam in the empirical setting remains unknown. Strains underwent genetic analysis evaluating blaKPC presence/production and MICs were determined. Four strains were assessed in an in vitro , one-compartment pharmacokinetic ( PK)/ pharmacodynamic ( PD) model for 96 h. The following bolus dosing exposures were tested: 2.5 g of ceftazidime/avibactam every 8 h , 2 g of meropenem every 8 h , 1.25 mg/kg polymyxin B every 12 h , amikacin ` once-daily dosing ' ( peak of 70-80 mg/L) , tigecycline at 200 mg × 1 dose followed by 100 mg every 12 h , and a drug-free growth control. Thirty blaKPC-producing strains were evaluated; 97 % of strains were ceftazidime/avibactam susceptible with MIC50/MIC90 values of 0.38/ 1.5 mg/L ( range 0.032-16 mg/L). Two K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> strains , one Klebsiella<pathogen> oxytoca<pathogen> strain and one Citrobacter<pathogen> freundii<pathogen> strain underwent further analysis in PK/PD models. Ceftazidime/avibactam displayed potent activity with a reduction of 4.23 ± 0.42 cfu/mL from the initial inoculum at 96 h. Against susceptible isolates , amikacin displayed similar activity compared with ceftazidime/avibactam at 96 h , although this was not demonstrated against all strains. Polymyxin B produced comparable activity to ceftazidime/avibactam against two strains. Neither meropenem nor tigecycline produced effective killing and were comparable to the drug-free growth control at 96 h. blaKPC-producing organisms demonstrated susceptibility to ceftazidime/avibactam and bactericidal activity was observed in the PK/PD model. Based on these data , ceftazidime/avibactam is a valuable agent for treating KPC-producing organisms and should be considered for treatment of infections caused by these pathogens.
