  The impact of age- , gender- , and race-based differences on safety and efficacy in phase I clinical trials has not been well studied. We analyzed data from phase I clinical trials evaluating targeted biologic agents in patients with advanced solid malignancies. Race and gender distribution of enrolled patients was compared to the referral population demographics at the city , metro , and state levels. The association between age , gender , and race with type , frequency , and severity of treatment-emergent toxicities and clinical benefit was assessed using univariate and multivariable models. Data from 117 eligible patients- Blacks/Caucasians/Others ( 27/85/5); male/female ( 66/51)- were obtained. Blacks were younger than Caucasian patients ( median age of 56 vs. 62 years , p = 0.004). Nausea/vomiting was more frequent in female patients ( 43 vs. 24 % , p = 0.03) , while hematologic toxicity was more likely in Whites. While median time on treatment was comparable ( 113 vs. 91; p = 0.840) , the median overall survival was significantly shorter for Blacks versus Caucasians ( 7.4 vs. 11.4 months; p = 0.0227). Black race ( HR 2.11; 95 % CI 1.24-3.60; p = 0.006) and older age ( HR 1.03; 95 % CI 1.00-1.06; p = 0.029) were associated with an increased risk of death. Age- , gender- , and race-based disparities were observed with specific toxicity and survival outcomes on phase I clinical trials of anticancer agents.
