  A thorough and fully application of the principles of gender mainstreaming , in accordance with the European Community guidelines , to the health and safety at work , implies the systematic review of the whole prevention from the gendered point of view. This means that both biology- and gender-based differences between male and female workers should be conceived not only as determinants of health but also as factors affecting either positively or negatively the health and safety risk prevention. In this evolutionary cultural step the role of the occupational physician is particularly important. In this paper we propose some operative tools that can concretely implement gender perspective in all the various areas of prevention , where the occupational physician has a leading , if not even exclusive , role such as risk assessment , training and health medical surveillance.
