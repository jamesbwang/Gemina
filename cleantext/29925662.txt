  VIRIP has been identified as natural HIV-1 inhibitor targeting the gp41 fusion peptide. An optimized analogue ( VIR-576) was effective in a phase I/II clinical trial and initial studies showed that HIV-1 resistance to VIRIP-based inhibitors has a high genetic barrier. Partially resistant CXCR4 ( X4)- tropic HIV-1 NL4-3 variants could be obtained , however , after more than 15 months of passaging in MT-4 cells in the presence of another derivative ( VIR-353). Sequence analysis identified the accumulation of seven mutations across the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein but outside of the gp41 fusion peptide. The authors suggested that the three initial alterations conferred resistance , while subsequent changes restored viral fitness. Here , we introduced these mutations individually and in combination into X4- and CCR5 ( R5)- tropic HIV-1 constructs and determined their impact on VIR-353 and VIR-576 susceptibility , viral infectivity , replication fitness , and fusogenicity. We found that essentially all seven mutations contribute to reduced susceptibility to VIRIP-based inhibitors. HIV-1 constructs containing â‰¥ 4 changes were substantially more resistant to both VIRIP-based inhibitors and the VRC34 .01 antibody targeting the fusion peptide. However , they were also much less infectious and fusogenic than those harboring only the three initial alterations. Furthermore , the additional changes attenuated rather than rescued HIV-1 replication in primary human cells. Thus , the genetic barrier to HIV-1 resistance against VIRIP-based inhibitors is higher than previously suggested and mutations reducing viral susceptibility come at a severe fitness cost that was not rescued during long-term cell culture passage.
