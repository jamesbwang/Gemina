  Weight gain and metabolic disturbances such as dyslipidemia , are frequent side effects of second-generation antipsychotics , including olanzapine. This study examined the metabolic effects of chronic olanzapine exposure. In addition , we investigated the hepatic fatty acid effects of olanzapine in female C57BL/6J mice fed a normal diet. Female C57BL/6J mice orally received olanzapine or normal saline for 7 weeks. The effects of long-term olanzapine exposure on body<symptom> weight changes , food efficiency , blood glucose , triglyceride ( TG) , insulin , and leptin levels were observed. Hepatic TG and abdominal fat mass were investigated , and fat cell morphology was analyzed through histopathological methods. The levels of protein markers of fatty acid regulation in the liver , namely fatty acid synthase ( FAS) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 ( SCD-1) , were measured. Olanzapine treatment increased the food intake of the mice as well as their body<symptom> weight. Biochemical analyses showed that olanzapine increased blood TG , insulin , leptin , and hepatic TG. The olanzapine group exhibited increased abdominal fat mass and fat cell enlargement in abdominal fat tissue. Western blotting of the mouse liver revealed significantly higher ( 1.6-fold) levels of SCD-1 in the olanzapine group relative to the control group; by contrast , FAS levels in the two groups did not differ significantly. Enhanced lipogenesis triggered by increased hepatic SCD-1 activity might be a probable peripheral mechanism of olanzapine-induced dyslipidemia. Some adverse metabolic effects of olanzapine may be related to the disturbance of lipid homeostasis in the liver.
