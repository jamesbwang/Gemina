  Ovarian carcinoma is a fatal malignancy in gynecological malignancies , and the prognosis still remains poor due to the lack of effective therapeutic targets. This study demonstrated that centromere protein U ( CENPU) was up-regulated in ovarian cancer. The ectopic expression of CENPU in ovarian cancer cells expedited the proliferation , migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Besides , the over-expression of CENPU markedly advanced the tumorigenicity of ovarian cancer cells in vivo whereas knocked-down CENPU resulted in opposite outcome. In addition , high mobility group box 2 ( HMGB2) identified as a down-target of CENPU in ovarian cancer cells was positively correlated with the expression level of CENPU in ovarian cancer tissues. Finally , it was demonstrated that CENPU could enhance the aggressiveness ability of the ovarian cancer cells by regulating HMGB2. This research provided new insight for CENPU , promoted the progression of ovarian cancer and represented a novel target for anti-ovarian cancer therapy.
