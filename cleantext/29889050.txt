  Atomic force microscopy ( AFM) allows us to reconstruct the topography of surfaces with resolution in the nanometer range. The exceptional resolution attainable with the AFM makes this instrument a key tool in nanoscience and technology. The core of a standard AFM set-up relies on the detection of the change of the mechanical motion of a micro-oscillator when approaching the sample to image. This is despite the fact that AFM is nowadays a very common instrument for both fundamental and applied research. The fabrication of the micrometric scale mechanical oscillator is still a very complicated and expensive task requiring dedicated platforms. Being able to perform AFM with a macroscopic oscillator would make the instrument more versatile and accessible for an even larger spectrum of applications and audience. Here , we present atomic force imaging with a centimetric oscillator , an aluminum tuning fork of centimeter size as a sensor on which an accelerometer is glued on one prong to measure the oscillations. We show that it is possible to perform topographic images of nanometric resolution with a gram tuning fork. In addition to the stunning sensitivity , we show the high versatility of such an oscillator by imaging both in air and liquid. The set-up proposed here can be extended to numerous experiments where the probe has to be heavy and/or very complex , and so too the environment.
