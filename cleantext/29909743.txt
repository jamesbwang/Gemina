  Sacubitril/valsartan reduced heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF)- admissions and cardiovascular mortality in the PARADIGM-HF-trial. However , real-world patients are often frailer and less able to tolerate high doses of sacubitril/valsartan. We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients prescribed sacubitril/valsartan in a single tertiary HF-clinic between December 2016 and January 2018. HF-admissions were assessed in a paired fashion , comparing the amount of antecedent HF-episodes with incident HF-episodes after the initiation. Baseline risk for adverse events was assessed by the EMPHASIS-HF-risk-score Results: A total of 201-HF-patients were retrospectively identified ( age = 68 ± 11 years , ejection fraction = 29 ± 8 %). Real world patients were older , had higher serum creatinine and a higher New-York Heart-Association ( NYHA)- class ( p < .05 for all) than in the PARADIGM-HF trial. Over a mean duration of 221 ± 114 days after initiation of sacubitril/valsartan a total of 23-individual patients experienced at least one HF-episodes. Over the same time period preceding initiation of sacubitril/valsartan , 51 individual patients experienced a HF-episodes ( p < .001). Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the rate of incident vs. antecedent HF-admissions , in patients with low or high baseline NYHA-class ( II vs. III and IV; p value = 0.019 respectively p = .004) or patients with an EMPHASIS-HF risk score below or above the mean ( p = .002 respectively p = .016). Patients older than 75-years exhibited a trend towards HF-reduction. Higher doses of sacubitril/valsartan were associated with more reduction in incident versus antecedent HF-episodes. Despite being frailer and older , real-world patients exhibit a significant and early reduction in incident HF-hospitalisations following initiation of sacubitril/valsartan. Higher doses might be associated with more reduction in HF-admissions , underscoring the importance of dose uptitration.
