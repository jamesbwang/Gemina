  Recently , several randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) explored the effects of α-blockers with or without phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors ( PDE5-Is) for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> ( LUTS/BPH). However , the results were inconsistent. We performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the role of combination therapy ( α-blockers and PDE5-Is) in patients with LUTS/BPH. Databases including PubMed , Cochrane library , Web of Science , and Embase were searched for qualified RCTs. Pooled mean differences ( MDs) and odds ratios ( ORs) were calculated to measure the effects and adverse events in combination therapy. Moreover , subgroup analyses of ethnicity , dosage of PDE5-Is , treatment duration , and severity of LUTS/BPH were performed. In addition , trial sequential analyses ( TSAs) were used to assess whether the evidence for the results was sufficient. Overall , this study identified 11 eligible RCTs , including 855 LUTS/BPH patients. Patients receiving combination therapy had better improvement in international prostate symptom score ( IPSS: MD: 1.66 , 95 % CI- 3.03 to- 0.29) , maximum urinary flow rate ( Q Our results indicated that combination therapy can significantly improve IPSS , Q
