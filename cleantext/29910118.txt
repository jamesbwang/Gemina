  A proven , but underutilized , method to increase current low vaccination rates is reminder/recall. Centralized reminder/recall using an Immunization Information System reduces the burden of an individual practice conducting reminder/recall. The objectives were to assess the effectiveness of centralized vaccine reminder/recall on improving adult vaccination rates using Colorado 's Immunization Information System. This study is a pragmatic RCT. Denver Health patients were divided into three strata: 25,039 individuals aged 19-64 years without a high-risk condition for pneumococcal disease , 16,897 individuals aged 19-64 years with a high-risk condition , and 5,332 individuals aged ≥ 65 years. Data were collected from October 2015 to April 2016 and analyzed between September 2016 and June 2017. Adults aged 19-64 years without a high-risk condition who needed influenza<disease> or tetanus<disease> , diphtheria<disease> , acellular pertussis<disease> vaccine or both , and adults with a high-risk condition and adults aged ≥ 65 years who needed influenza<disease> , or tetanus<disease> , diphtheria<disease> , acellular pertussis<disease> , or pneumococcal vaccine , or all three vaccines were randomized to receive up to three reminder/recalls or usual care. Documentation of receipt of any needed vaccine in Immunization Information System ≤ 6 months after the reminder/recall was the primary outcome. A secondary outcome included implementation costs of the reminder/recall effort. A mixed effects model assessed the association between the intervention and receipt of any needed vaccine while controlling for gender , age , race , ethnicity , insurance type , and history of vaccine refusal. The intervention was associated with receipt of any needed vaccine in the adults aged ≥ 65 years population ( AOR = 1.15 , 95 % CI = 1.02 , 1.30) , but not the other two populations. Influenza<disease> vaccine was the source of this difference , with 32.0 % receiving a vaccine in intervention versus 28.6 % in usual-care groups ( p ≤ 0.01). Start-up and implementation costs per person were $ 0.86. In the population aged ≥ 65 years , 29.4 patients would need to be contacted to gain one additional vaccination. Centralized reminder/recall was effective at increasing influenza<disease> vaccination rates in adults aged ≥ 65 years over a short time period , without burdening the practices , and at a reasonable cost.
