  The aim of the present study is to explore , through a mediation model , the relationship among self-esteem , coping strategies , and the risk of Internet addiction in a sample of 300 Italian university students. We submitted the data to a descriptive , mediational comparison between variables ( t-test) , and correlational statistical analyses. The results confirmed the effect of self-esteem on the risk of Internet addiction. However , we found that the introduction of coping strategies as a mediator gives rise to partial mediation. A low level of self-esteem is a predictor of avoidance-oriented coping that , in turn , affects the risk of Internet addiction.
