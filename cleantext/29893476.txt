  Indications for surgical resection of non-colorectal , non-neuroendocrine ( NCNNE) liver metastases are unclear. This study analysed the influence of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the presence of extrahepatic disease ( EHD) on outcomes. Patients who underwent hepatic resection for NCNNE liver metastases and who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy at a single centre between 1982 and 2016 were analysed retrospectively. Patients were classified as having no EHD , controlled EHD or non-controlled EHD. Hepatic resection was performed in 199 patients ( 81 · 2 per cent) after partial or complete response to chemotherapy or disease stabilization , and 46 patients ( 18 · 8 per cent) after tumour progression. Patients with progressive disease after chemotherapy had worse overall survival than those without ( 23 versus 50 · 4 per cent at 5 years; P = 0 · 004). Median survival was 63 · 6 ( range 31 · 1-94 · 8) months for patients without EHD , 34 · 8 ( 19 · 2-49 · 2) months for those with controlled EHD and 7 · 2 ( 1 · 2-13 · 2) months for patients with non-controlled EHD ( P = 0 · 004). In multivariable analysis , EHD ( P = 0 · 004) , response to chemotherapy ( P = 0 · 004) and resection margins ( P = 0 · 002) were all independent predictors of overall survival , regardless of primary tumour site. The prognosis of patients with NCNNE liver metastases is influenced by preoperative chemotherapy and resectability.
