  The systematic control over association mechanisms of self-assembled materials has been demonstrated through the rational design and synthesis of a series of amphiphilic dinuclear alkynylplatinum ( II) bzimpy ( bzimpy = 2,6-bis ( N-alkylbenzimidazol-2 '- yl) pyridine) complexes containing the shape-persistent oligo ( p-phenyleneethynylene) s. Multistage morphological transformations from plates to fibers and to spherical nanostructures under different solvent compositions have been demonstrated. The subtle balances<symptom> between multiple noncovalent interactions including Pt · · · Pt , hydrophobic , hydrophilic , and π-π stacking interactions are found to have profound impact on the supramolecular assembly of the system , in which a change in the association mechanism from isodesmic to cooperative and back to isodesmic growth has been observed upon increasing hydrophilicity of the complexes.
