  Following an initial mechanical insult , traumatic spinal cord injury ( SCI) induces a secondary wave of injury , resulting in a toxic lesion<symptom> environment inhibitory to axonal regeneration. This review focuses on the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF) and its application , in combination with other factors and cell transplantations , for repairing the injured spinal cord. As studies of recent decades strongly suggest that combinational treatment approaches hold the greatest therapeutic potential for the central nervous system ( CNS) trauma , future directions of combinational therapies will also be discussed.
