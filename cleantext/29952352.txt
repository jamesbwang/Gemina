  The migration and invasion of vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs) caused by advanced aging play an important role in diffuse intimal thickening , facilitate adverse arterial remodeling and contribute to the initiation and progression of cardiovascular diseases. The inhibitory function of Buyang Huanwu decoction ( BYHWD) has been found on aortic intimal hyperplasia<disease> and VSMC proliferation , but its effect on age-associated migration and invasion remains unknown. Here , we used an in vitro angiotensin II ( Ang II)- induced senescence model to study the effects of serum containing BYHWD ( BYHWS) on the migratory and invasive capacities , matrix metalloprotease type 2 ( MMP-2) expression and modulation of sirtuin1 ( SIRT1) signaling in human aorta VSMCs ( HA-VAMCs). Our results showed that BYHWS was able to inhibit Ang II-induced migration and invasion , with down-regulation of MMP-2. In addition , manipulation of SIRT1 by either over-expression or siRNA knockdown ameliorated or promoted cellular migration and invasion , respectively. Moreover , BYHWS reversed senescence-mediated decrease of SIRT1 levels and SIRT1 was required for BYHWS regulation on migration and invasion of senescent HA-VAMCs. In summary , our data demonstrated that BYHWS suppressed the migration and invasion of age-associated VSMC via an increase of the SIRT1 level , which provides novel insights for the therapy of age-associated cardiovascular diseases.
