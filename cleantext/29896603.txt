  Nanoparticles are functional materials able to offer improved or new synergetic properties. By manipulating the interfacial properties , we demonstrate an innovative sandwich-interface method capable of forming various monodispersed nanostructures including metals , semiconductors , and inorganic and coordinated nanoparticles. By analysing of the reaction mechanism , we show that reaction time , the height of transition and presence of surfactant have the greatest influence on the formation of the products. These advances in the sandwich-interface synthesis significantly extend the scope of interface synthetic methods , facilitating a new level of structural-architectural control which may lead to future developments in the field of crystallography.
