  Industrial dye effluents with low biodegradability are highly toxic and carcinogenic on both human and aquatic lives , thus they are detrimental to the biodiversity of environment. Herein , this data set presents the potential of cationic Nickel based MOFs in the adsorption of charged and neutral dye molecules. Data set include a concise description of experimental conditions for the synthesis of imidazolium ligands , 1,3-bis ( 4-carboxyphenyl) imidazolium chloride ( H
