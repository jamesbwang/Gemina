  Sequencing technologies have undergone a paradigm shift from bulk to single-cell resolution in response to an evolving understanding of the role of cellular heterogeneity in biological systems. However , single-cell sequencing of large populations has been hampered by limitations in processing genomes for sequencing. In this paper , we describe a method for single-cell genome sequencing ( SiC-seq) which uses droplet microfluidics to isolate , amplify , and barcode the genomes of single cells. Cell encapsulation in microgels allows the compartmentalized purification and tagmentation of DNA , while a microfluidic merger efficiently pairs each genome with a unique single-cell oligonucleotide barcode , allowing > 50,000 single cells to be sequenced per run. The sequencing data is demultiplexed by barcode , generating groups of reads originating from single cells. As a high-throughput and low-bias method of single-cell sequencing , SiC-seq will enable a broader range of genomic studies targeted at diverse cell populations.
