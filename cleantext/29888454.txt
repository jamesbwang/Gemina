  To explore if clinical effects and hypoglycaemia risks associated with insulin glargine 300 U/mL ( Gla-300) and 100 U/mL ( Gla-100) differed by sulphonylurea and/or glinide ( SU/G) treatment. A post hoc subgroup analysis of 12-month treatment data from the EDITION Japan 2 trial , a randomized , open-label , phase 3 study of Japanese people with type 2 diabetes receiving once-daily Gla-300/ Gla-100 + oral antihyperglycaemic drugs. Participants previously receiving SU/G ( + SU/G) were compared with those not taking SU/G (- SU/G). Endpoints included HbA1c , hypoglycaemia and body<symptom> weight. For + SU/G ( n = 152 , 63 %) , HbA1c was reduced from baseline to month 12 for Gla-300 ( 8.1 % to 7.6 %) and Gla-100 ( 8.2 % to 7.8 %). For- SU/G ( n = 89 , 37 %) , reductions were 7.8 % to 7.4 % , and 7.9 % to 7.5 % for Gla-300 and Gla-100 , respectively. A lower annualized rate of hypoglycaemia with Gla-300 versus Gla-100 was observed at night ( 00:00-05:59 hours; p = 0.0001) and any time of day ( 24 hour; p = 0.0015). Irrespective of the insulin used , the incidence and rate of confirmed ( ≤ 3.9 mmol/L ( ≤ 70 mg/dL)) or severe hypoglycaemia appeared higher in + SU/G versus- SU/G; overall , a reduced incidence of nocturnal hypoglycaemia , and rate of hypoglycaemia at any time , was observed in- SU/G versus + SU/G. In the- SU/G subgroup , body<symptom> weight gain differences were observed between Gla-300 and Gla-100 ( p < 0.0001). Participants with prior and continued SU/G use had similar therapeutic responses with basal insulin but greater risk of hypoglycaemia than those not using SU/G; hypoglycaemia risk was lower with Gla-300 than Gla-100 in both subgroups.
