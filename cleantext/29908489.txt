  Work-related deaths represent an important social problem. We report all the occupational fatal injuries recorded by the Brescia Institute of Forensic Medicine from 1982 to 2015. A total of 426 post-mortem examinations due to accidental work injuries were retrospectively analysed according to temporal distribution ( year , month and day of the workplace accident); workers ' characteristics ( sex , age , nationality); type of occupation; cause of death; anatomical region of fatal injuries and timing of death. The accidental occupational events occurred with a mean of 12.5 cases per year. Almost all the workers were male ( 99 %) and Italians ( 87 %) , aged between 35 and 49 years old ( 34.27 %). The occupation with more fatalities was construction ( 36.62 %) , followed by mechanical industry ( 19.25 %) and agriculture ( 13.15 %). Most of deaths were connected to a mechanical trauma ( 77.69 %) such as falls , machinery-related events , blunt forces or explosions. The predominant site of the lethal wound<disease> was the head ( 33.56 %) , with a high percentage of death resulting from a traumatic brain injury. In 30.75 % of cases death occurred after a short period of hospitalization.
