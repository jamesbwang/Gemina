  The study investigated the influence of religion and locus of control on perception of mental illness. Specifically , the study explored the relationship between religiosity and perception of mental illness , differences in perception by internals and externals , the effect of knowledge on perception of mental illness and the interactive effect of religiosity and locus of control on perception of mental illness. Data were collected from 200 participants in the Volta Region of Ghana. Three hypotheses were tested in the study using a battery of tests. It was observed that people with internal locus of control perceive mental patients positively than those with external locus of control. A significant interactive effect between religiosity and locus of control on perception of mental illness was observed. Religiosity significantly relates to perception of mental illness. The results and implications are discussed for further studies.
