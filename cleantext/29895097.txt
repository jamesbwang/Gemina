  Skin cancers are extremely common and the incidence increases with age. Care for patients with multiple or complicated skin cancers often require multidisciplinary input involving a general practitioner , dermatologist , plastic surgeon and/or radiation oncologist. Timely , efficient care of these patients relies on precise and effective communication between all parties. Until now , descriptions regarding the location of lesions<symptom> on the scalp have been inaccurate , which can lead to error with the incorrect lesion<symptom> being excised or biopsied. A novel technique for accurately and efficiently describing the location of lesions<symptom> on the scalp , using a coordinate system , is described ( the ` scalp coordinate system ' ( SCS)). This method was tested in a pilot study by clinicians typically involved in the care of patients with cutaneous malignancies. A mannequin scalp was used in the study. The SCS significantly improved the accuracy in the ability to both describe and locate lesions<symptom> on the scalp. This improved accuracy comes at a minor time cost. The direct and indirect costs arising from poor communication between medical subspecialties ( particularly relevant in surgical procedures) are immense. An effective tool used by all involved clinicians is long overdue particularly in patients with scalps with extensive actinic damage , scarring or innocuous biopsy sites. The SCS provides the opportunity to improve outcomes for both the patient and healthcare system.
