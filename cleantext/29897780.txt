  A highly potent donor-acceptor biaryl thermally activated delayed fluorescence ( TADF) dye is accessible by a concise two-step sequence employing two-fold Ullmann arylation and a sequentially Pd-catalyzed Masuda borylation-Suzuki arylation ( MBSA). Photophysical investigations show efficient TADF at ambient temperature due to the sterical hindrance between the donor and acceptor moieties. The photoluminescence quantum yield amounts to Î¦
