  Various forms of overcrowding are common in heifer-rearing operations. Our objectives for this study were to evaluate the effects of overstocking at the feedbunk ( 100 , 133 , 160 , or 200 % of capacity) on the growth performance , feedbunk sorting behaviors , and hygiene of 128 gravid Holstein heifers ( 475 ± 55.3 kg) consuming an alfalfa haylage and corn silage diet diluted with processed wheat straw at an inclusion rate of 25.2 % ( DM basis). In this study , heifers were overstocked only at the feedbunk , and not with respect to available freestalls or pen area. Heifers were blocked by weight , and subsequently assigned to 1 of 16 identical research pens. A total mixed ration was distributed at 1000 h daily for 91 d via a drive-through feed alley , with heifers allowed access to the feedbunk through head-locking feeding gates. Mean weights for the 4 blocks ( 32 heifers/block) were 406 ± 14.9 , 453 ± 15.3 , 493 ± 17.6 , and 548 ± 21.9 kg. Generally , nutrient intakes were not affected by stocking rate at the feedbunk; mean intakes of dry matter , neutral detergent fiber , and total digestible nutrients across all feedbunk stocking rates were 10.63 , 5.19 , and 6.29 kg/d , respectively. Overall , the effects of competition at the feedbunk on heifer growth performance were minor , with a collective average daily gain of 1.02 kg/d across all treatments. Only trends for linear increases in total weight gain and BCS were observed with overstocking at the feedbunk. Collectively , overstocked rates also exhibited a trend for better feed-to-gain ratio than pens stocked at 100 % of feedbunk capacity ( 10.3 vs. 11.0 kg: kg). We observed solid evidence that heifers collectively sorted against large ( > 19 mm) particles , and also exhibited preference for short ( > 1.18 and < 8 mm) and fine ( < 1.18 mm) feed particles; however , these responses were not affected by feedbunk stocking rate. Additionally , heifers sorted against neutral detergent fiber as the concentration of neutral detergent fiber remaining in the feedbunk increased during the 24-h period following feeding; conversely , they preferred crude protein , as indicated by a decreasing concentration of this nutrient over time. Heifer hygiene was not affected by competition at the feedbunk. Under the experimental conditions established for this trial , overstocking at the feedbunk did not affect heifer growth performance , but it should not be practiced blindly without attention to other critical components of animal welfare.
