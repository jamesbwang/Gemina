  Treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg has been associated with gallbladder-related adverse events. To conduct a single-centre , double-blind , 12-week trial comparing the effect of 0.6 mg liraglutide and steady-state liraglutide 3.0 mg with placebo on gallbladder emptying in adults with body mass index ( BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m Participants were randomized 1:1 to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide ( n = 26) or placebo ( n = 26) , starting at 0.6 mg with 0.6-mg weekly increments to 3.0 mg , with nutritional and physical activity counselling. A 600-kcal ( 23.7 g fat) liquid meal test was performed at baseline , after the first dose and after 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the 12-week maximum postprandial gallbladder ejection fraction ( GBEF Baseline characteristics were similar between groups ( mean ± SD overall age 47.6 ± 10.0 years , BMI 32.6 ± 3.4 kg/m Treatment with liraglutide did not affect the GBEF
