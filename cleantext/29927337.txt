  Tomosynthesis is proposed to improve breast cancer assessment and staging as a complementary role to its detection capability. We examine the accuracy of tomosynthesis in measuring tumor size relative to pathology and compared with other tests. Areas covered: A systematic literature search identified studies of tomosynthesis in estimating the size of newly diagnosed breast cancers. Descriptive analyses were performed due to heterogeneity in patients , technology , and methods between studies. Eight studies were eligible ( 678 patients). Mean differences ( MDs) between measurements ( tomosynthesis-pathology) were generally small; overestimation ( MDs of 1-3 mm) and underestimation ( -1 mm) were reported. Limits of agreement ( LOA) ranged between ± 10 mm and ± 28 mm. MDs did not differ in high and low breast densities. Large underestimation ( -11 mm) and wide LOA ( ± 41 mm) were reported for invasive lobular carcinoma. MDs and LOA were lower for tomosynthesis than mammography , but differences between tests were small. Expert commentary: Although tomosynthesis is a promising technology for assessing breast cancer size , few studies in that context had limitations ( small sample sizes , heterogeneous populations , and technologies). Studies using current technology and appropriate statistical methods are required to establish the magnitude of improvement in measurement accuracy , and patients for whom the test may be of most benefit.
