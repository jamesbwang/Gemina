  Brown adipose tissue ( BAT) undergoes pronounced changes after birth coincident with the loss of the BAT-specific uncoupling protein ( UCP) 1 and rapid fat growth. The extent to which this adaptation may vary between anatomical locations remains unknown , or whether the process is sensitive to maternal dietary supplementation. We , therefore , conducted a data mining based study on the major fat depots ( i.e. epicardial , perirenal , sternal ( which possess UCP1 at 7 days) , subcutaneous and omental) ( that do not possess UCP1) of young sheep during the first month of life. Initially we determined what effect adding 3 % canola oil to the maternal diet has on mitochondrial protein abundance in those depots which possessed UCP1. This demonstrated that maternal dietary supplementation delayed the loss of mitochondrial proteins , with the amount of cytochrome C actually being increased. Using machine learning algorithms followed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis , we demonstrated that each depot could be segregated into a unique and concise set of modules containing co-expressed genes involved in adipose function. Finally using lipidomic analysis following the maternal dietary intervention , we confirmed the perirenal depot to be most responsive. These insights point at new research avenues for examining interventions to modulate fat development in early life.
