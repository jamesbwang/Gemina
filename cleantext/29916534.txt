  The aim of the present study was to investigate the key genes , miRNAs and pathways in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( HPSCC) and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying HPSCC development. The gene and microRNA ( miRNA) expression profiles of HPSCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues from three subjects were obtained. Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) and differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in HPSCC. Functional annotation and protein‑protein interaction ( PPI) network were conducted to elucidate the biological functions of DEGs. A total of 160 DEGs ( 16 upregulated and 144 downregulated genes) and 79 differentially expressed miRNAs ( 48 upregulated and 31 downregulated miRNAs) were identified in HPSCC. The deregulated genes were significantly involved in spliceosome , cell cycle and RNA degradation. In the PPI network , S‑phase kinase associated protein 1 ( SKP1) , non‑POU domain containing octamer binding ( NONO) and zinc activated ion channel ( ZACN) were identified as hub proteins. On the whole , the present study may help to gain a comprehensive understanding of tumorigenesis in HPSCC and provide valuable information for early diagnosis and drug design of HPSCC in future research.
