  To compare the effects of switching tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF) or treatment with an intravenous bisphosphonate on bone mineral density ( BMD) in HIV-positive adults with low bone mass. Two-year , randomised , open-label study at 10 sites in Australia and Spain. Of 112 adults on TDF-based antiretroviral therapy ( ART) screened , 87 with low BMD ( T-score < -1.0 at hip or spine by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) and undetectable plasma HIV<pathogen> viral load were randomised to either switch TDF to another active antiretroviral drug or to continue TDF-based ART and receive intravenous zoledronic acid ( ZOL) 5 mg annually for 2 years. Change in lumbar spine BMD at 24 months by intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included changes in femoral neck and total hip BMD , fractures , safety , and virological failure. 44 subjects were randomised to TDF switch and 43 to ZOL , mean age 50 years ( SD 11) , 96 % men , mean TDF duration 5.9 years ( SD 3.1) , and mean spine and hip T-scores -1.6 and -1.3 , respectively. At 24 months , mean spine BMD increased by 7.4 % ( SD 4.3 %) with ZOL vs. 2.9 % ( SD 4.5 %) with TDF-switch ( mean difference 4.4 % , 95 % CI 2.6-6.3; p < 0.001). Mean total hip BMD increased by 4.6 % ( 2.6 %) and 2.6 % ( 4.0 %) , respectively ( mean difference 1.9 % , 95 % CI 0.5-3.4; p = 0.009). There was 1 fracture in the ZOL group versus 7 fractures in 4 TDF-switch subjects. Virological failure occurred in 1 TDF-switch subject. Other safety endpoints were similar. ZOL is more effective than switching TDF at increasing BMD in HIV-positive adults with low bone mass.
