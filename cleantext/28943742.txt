  Scientific education and a clinical background allow orthopaedic surgeons to perform leading research. Several resources , skills and techniques may be developed to maximize their research potential.Surgeon-researchers should develop Specific , Measurable , Achievable , Realistic , and Time-defined ( SMART) goals. It is critical to define a timeline- which can be 1 year , 3 years , 5 years- to re-evaluate goals and to plan and identify potential obstacles.Physician-scientists are a product of training , funding , resources , practice setting , context , environment , and infrastructure. Although orthopaedic surgery has difficulty in recruiting surgeon-scientists , these are essential for the promotion of advances in technologies and treatment , as they have unique abilities to raise questions from the bedside and the operating room.The most critical personal traits necessary to succeed as a surgeon-scientist are persistence , resilience , and passion for research. These traits may be innate or acquired through mentorship and from role models.Mentors can improve mentees ' research efficiency and help them to persevere.Clinical researchers and surgeon-scientists should focus their research interests and efforts in their areas of clinical expertise.For surgeon-researchers to succeed they must have passion for research , persistence in working toward a goal , collaboration/teamwork skills , resilience , research training/experience , a track record of publications , clear goals and expectations , and a defined research plan as well as being clinically excellent. A formal research degree is desirable.Having non-clinician scientists in the team brings added expertise and value.Funding and protected research time are important. To provide outstanding clinical care and improve the quality of the care delivered , surgeons must be leaders in innovation and research. Cite this article:
