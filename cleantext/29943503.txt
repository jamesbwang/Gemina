  The main goal of our study was to investigate whether a selective antagonism of the adenosine A All experiments were carried out on male Albino Swiss mice. The forced swim test and the tail suspension test were used to evaluate the antidepressant-like potential. Drug concentrations in animals ' serum and brains were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The antidepressant potential of moclobemide ( 1.5 mg/kg) , venlafaxine ( 1 mg/kg) and bupropion ( 10 mg/kg) was enhanced by a co-administration with 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine ( DMPX; an antagonist of adenosine A Blockage of the adenosine receptors ( particularly the A
