  3-Isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine ( IBMP) is a potent odorant present in grapes and wines that is reminiscent of green capsicum. Suprathreshold concentrations can lead to obvious vegetative characters and suppress desirable fruity aroma nuances in wines , but options to manage IBMP concentrations are limited. This work investigated pre- and postfermentation addition of a putative imprinted magnetic polymer ( PIMP) as a remedial treatment for elevated concentrations of IBMP in Cabernet Sauvignon grape must in comparison to nonimprinted magnetic polymer ( NIMP) and to a commercially available polylactic acid ( PLA) based film added postfermentation. Chemical and sensory analyses of wines showed that PIMP treatments were more effective than PLA film for decreasing `` fresh green '' aroma nuances without negatively impacting overall aroma profiles and that postfermentation addition of a magnetic polymer removed up to 74 % of the initial IBMP concentration compared to 18 % for PLA. Prefermentation addition of magnetic polymers removed 20-30 % less IBMP compared to that of postfermentation addition but also had less of an effect on other wine volatiles and color parameters.
