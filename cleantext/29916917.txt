  The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the detection rate of Ga-PSMA PET/CT in biochemical recurrence ( BCR) of prostate cancer and its impact on patient management. Patients with BCR after curatively intended treatment of prostate cancer were included. Each patient underwent a Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Changes in patient management based on the results of Ga-PSMA PET/CT were assessed. Seventy patients were included. Sixty-four patients ( 91 %) had radical prostatectomy , of whom 17 patients ( 24 %) received salvage radiation therapy due to first biochemical relapse. Six patients ( 9 %) underwent radiation therapy as the primary treatment. Ga-PSMA PET/CT detected recurrent disease in 37 patients ( 53 %). The detection rate was 22 % for prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) levels up to 0.5 ng/mL compared with 83 % for PSA levels greater than 0.5 ng/mL. Pathological uptake of Ga-PSMA was observed in 4 ( 16 %) of 21 , 4 ( 44 %) of 9 , 0 of 1 , 7 ( 70 %) of 10 , and 22 ( 88 %) of 25 patients with PSA levels from 0.2 to 0.3 ng/mL , 0.31 to 0.4 ng/mL , 0.41 to 0.5 ng/mL , 0.51 to 1 ng/mL , and greater than 1 ng/mL , respectively. Prostate-specific antigen was significantly higher in PSMA-positive patients than in PSMA-negative patients. In 15 ( 22 %) of 69 patients , the results caused a definite change in patient management , and in another 15 ( 22 %) of 69 patients , Ga-PSMA PET/CT guided the choice of treatment. Ga-PSMA PET/CT detects lesions<symptom> in a large proportion of patients with BCR. Detection rates at low PSA levels ( < 0.5 ng/mL) were notably below the values reported in previous retrospective studies; however , detection rates improved with increasing PSA levels.
