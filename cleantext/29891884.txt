  RASA1-related disorders are vascular malformation syndromes<disease> characterized by hereditary capillary malformations ( CM) with or without arteriovenous malformations ( AVM) , arteriovenous fistulas<disease> ( AVF) , or Parkes Weber syndrome<disease>. The number of cases reported is relatively small; and while the main clinical features are CMs and AVMs/AVFs , the broader phenotypic spectrum caused by variants in the RASA1 gene is still being defined. Here , we report the clinical and molecular findings in 69 unrelated cases with a RASA1 variant identified at ARUP Laboratories. Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were primarily used to evaluate RASA1. Several atypical cases were evaluated using next-generation sequencing ( NGS) and array-comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH). Sixty individuals had a deleterious RASA1 variant of which 29 were novel. Nine individuals had a variant of uncertain significance. Five large RASA1 deletions were detected , giving an overall deletion/duplication rate of 8.3 % ( 5/60) among positive cases. Most ( 75.4 %) individuals with a RASA1 variant had CMs , and 44.9 % had an AVM/AVF. Clinical findings in several cases expand the RASA1 phenotype. Our data suggest that screening for large RASA1 deletions and duplications in this disorder is important and suggest that NGS multi-gene panel testing is beneficial for the molecular diagnosis of cases with complex vascular phenotypes.
