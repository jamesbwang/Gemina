  Transcriptional enhancers constitute a subclass of regulatory elements that facilitate transcription. Such regions are generally organized by short stretches of DNA enriched in transcription factor-binding sites but also can include very large regions containing clusters of enhancers , termed super-enhancers. These regions increase the probability or the rate ( or both) of transcription generally in
