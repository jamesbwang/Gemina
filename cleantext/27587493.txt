  Congenital aortic stenosis ( AS) is a rare disease. Treatment options for newborns are challenging. Newborns may have higher reintervention rate and mortality. The study aimed to identify the factors predictive of reintervention following balloon aortic valvuloplasty ( BAV) for AS during infancy. Retrospectively , between 2001 and 2016 , echocardiography ( echo) and cardiac catheterization data for infants with AS were analyzed , including follow-ups and reinterventions. Percentage reduction was defined as the ratio between the drop of aortic valve ( AV) peak gradient and the baseline peak gradient. Sixty infants were included and 48 were followed up. Sixteen ( 27 %) patients were neonates. Peak-to-peak gradient at AV was 64 ± 27 mmHg , which was reduced to 27 ± 13 mmHg. Percentage reduction was 53 % ± 24 %. Forty-nine ( 82 %) patients had adequate results ( residual AV gradient < 35 mmHg). There was no significant aortic insufficiency ( AI) before procedure , while 6 ( 10 %) patients had increased AI immediately after BAV. Of 48 patients , 14 ( 29 %) required an additional BAV. Of 48 patients , 8 ( 17 %) required surgical interventions following BAV. Reintervention was associated more with small left ventricular outflow tract ( LVOT) , high residual AV , and low percentage reduction. Mortality was 8.3 %. BAV in infancy has a reasonable success rate ( 82 %) with high rate of reintervention. Patent ductus arteriosus-dependent neonates carried the highest risk of mortality. Small LVOT , high AV residual gradient , and low percentage reduction resulted in more reinterventions.
