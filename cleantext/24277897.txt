  Extranodal extension in cervical lymph nodes is an important risk factor for the progression and prognosis of papillary thyroid cancer. The purpose of this study was to identify the common and characteristic preoperative ultrasonography features that are associated with the pathologic extranodal extension of metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma. We retrospectively assessed and compared clinicopathologic and ultrasound features between 60 papillary thyroid cancer patients with extranodal extension and 120 control patients with papillary thyroid cancer without extranodal extension. With respect to the pathological N stage and clinicopathologic features , N1b stage papillary thyroid carcinomas were more frequently found in patients who were extranodal extension-positive , in comparison with those who were extranodal extension-negative ( 78.3 % Common ultrasound features may indicate the presence of extranodal extension in patients with metastatic cervical lymph nodes of papillary thyroid carcinoma.
