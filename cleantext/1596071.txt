  Reconstruction<pathogen> of complex abdominal wall<pathogen> defects<pathogen> is both challenging and technically demanding for plastic surgeon<pathogen>. Objectives<pathogen> in abdominal wall<pathogen> reconstruction<pathogen> are consistent and include restoration<pathogen> of abdominal wall<pathogen> integrity<pathogen> , protection<pathogen> of intra<pathogen> abdominal viscera<pathogen> and prevention<pathogen> of herniation<pathogen>. We conducted a retrospective study<pathogen> on five patients<pathogen> in whom lateral thigh<pathogen> flaps<pathogen> such as anterolateral thigh<pathogen> ( ALT<pathogen>) flaps<pathogen> and tensor<pathogen> fascia<pathogen> lata<pathogen> ( TFL) myocutaneous flaps<pathogen> as pedicled<pathogen> or free flaps<pathogen> were used for complex abdominal wall<pathogen> Type<pathogen> II defects<pathogen> over a 5- years<pathogen> period<pathogen> between 2007 and 2012. In two patients<pathogen> , free flaps<pathogen> were used for reconstruction<pathogen> of the upper abdomen<pathogen> and both were ALT<pathogen>. In three patients<pathogen> of lower abdominal defects<pathogen> , one patient<pathogen> had bilateral pedicled ALT<pathogen> flaps<pathogen> , one pedicled TFL myocutaneous and one free TFL myocutaneous in view<pathogen> of ipsilateral electric burn scars<pathogen>. There were no flap<pathogen> losses<pathogen>. Patients<pathogen> were followed up beyond 6 months<pathogen> and found to have a good abdominal contour<pathogen> and only one of five had clinical evidence<pathogen> of herniation<pathogen>. It can be concluded that flap<pathogen> from the Lateral thigh<pathogen> ( ALT<pathogen> or TFL) is flap<pathogen> of choice<pathogen> for large Type<pathogen> II abdominal defects<pathogen>. Including vascularised fascia<pathogen> in the flap<pathogen> maintains abdominal wall<pathogen> integrity<pathogen> and use<pathogen> of synthetic mesh<pathogen> is not necessary. Upper<pathogen> abdominal defects<pathogen> need free flaps<pathogen> and in lower abdominal defects<pathogen> a pedicled flap<pathogen> suffices.
