  Only a few cases of infantile anti-red blood cell alloantibody production have been reported. A 7-month-old girl with acute lymphoid leukemia<disease> developed anti-E alloantibody 13 days after transfusion of E-positive red blood cells. Antibody screening was performed before and at 2 , 6 , 13 , 18 , 27 , 34 , and 49 days after red blood cell transfusion. Identification test , direct immunoglobulin test , acid elution , and dithiothreitol test were also performed. Anti-E alloantibody was detected in the blood 13 days after the first transfusion. The detected antibody was IgM and it decreased below detectable levels within 49 days after the first transfusion. Follow-up testing for the presence of post-transfusion alloantibody at appropriate times is important , even in infants.
