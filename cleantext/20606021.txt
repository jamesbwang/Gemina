  The study aimed at determining the relationship between refraction and anthropometric measurements and the relationship between the level of education and refractive status in a Nigerian young adult population. Healthy volunteers from the students and staff of a teaching hospital in South-Western Nigeria were studied. Demographic profiles including participants ' highest educational status , parental educational level , and the age at first formal school enrollment were documented. The height and weight of the participants were measured. Noncycloplegic objective refraction was determined with autorefractor , and the spherical equivalent refraction ( SER) of the right eye was used for analysis. SPSS 16 was used to explore the relationships between refraction , height , weight , and body mass index and the educational status of the participants. Two hundred and thirty-nine adults with a mean age of 28.4 ± 6.5 years comprising 116 males and 123 females were studied. The mean height , weight , body mass index , and right eye SER were 1.7 ± 0.1 m , 64.4 ± 12.2 kg , 23.6 ± 4.3 kg/m This study demonstrated a significant positive relationship between height and myopia in male participants but not in females. Individual as well as parental higher levels of education have also shown a positive association with myopic tendency.
