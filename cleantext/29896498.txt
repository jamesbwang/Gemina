  Hot tensile test data of Gas Tungsten Arc Welded ( GTAW) autogenous joints of Super 304HCu tubes tested at their operating temperature are presented along with the microstructure of the weld joint. The GTAW joints exhibited lower tensile strength than the parent metal and the failure occurred in the weld metal region for all test temperatures. Constant load Stress Corrosion Cracking ( SCC) test data of the GTAW weld joints tested in boiling MgCl
