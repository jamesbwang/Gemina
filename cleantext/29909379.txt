  To report percutaneous transcranial puncture , embolisation and occlusion of a very symptomatic hypoglossal canal/anterior condylar vein dural arteriovenous fistula<disease> ( DAVF) using syngo iGuide navigational software in a patient in whom transarterial and transvenous embolisation and surgery had failed. After unsuccessful arterial and venous embolisation and surgical treatment of a symptomatic hypoglossal canal DAVF , a 47-year-old man was transferred for further management. With exquisite anatomic detail provided by C-arm cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT) equipment ( Artis zee Biplane , Dyna CT VC21H , Siemens Healthcare GmbH , Germany) and syngo iGuide needle guidance navigational software ( Siemens Healthcare GmbHy) for planning a safe direct approach , the hypoglossal/anterior condylar vein , the dominant outflow vein of the fistula<disease> , was needle punctured percutaneously at the hypoglossal foramen and occluded with ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer liquid embolic agent ( Onyx , Medtronic , Minneapolis , Minnesota , USA) after placing two anchoring platinum coils ( Target detachable coils , Stryker Neurovascular , Fremont , California , USA). After a year of progressively severe left eye proptosis , chemosis and increased intraocular pressure , the symptoms quickly subsided after this embolisation and the patient was symptom free at his 3-month and later checkups. With guidance and imaging provided by CBCT and syngo iGuide navigational software , an otherwise untreatable DAVF was successfully embolised and obliterated by an aggressive unique percutaneous trans-cranial needle puncture of the dominant outflow vein in the hypoglossal canal.
