  Introduction Persistent idiopathic facial<symptom> pain<symptom> is a refractory and disabling condition of unknown mechanism and etiology. It has been suggested that persistent idiopathic facial<symptom> pain<symptom> patients have not only peripheral generators of pain , but also central nervous system changes that would contribute to the persistence of symptoms. We hypothesized that persistent idiopathic facial<symptom> pain<symptom> would have changes in brain cortical excitability as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation compared to healthy controls. Methods Twenty-nine persistent idiopathic facial<symptom> pain<symptom> patients were compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls and underwent cortical excitability measurements by transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the cortical representation of the masseter muscle of both hemispheres. Single-pulse stimulation was used to measure the resting motor threshold and suprathreshold motor-evoked potentials. Paired-pulse stimulation was used to assess short intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation. Clinical pain and associated symptoms were assessed with validated tools. Results Spontaneous<symptom> pain<symptom> was found in 27 ( 93.1 %) and provoked pain was found in two ( 6.9 %) persistent idiopathic facial<symptom> pain<symptom> patients. The motor-evoked potentials at 120 % and 140 % were significantly lower for both hemispheres compared to controls. Persistent idiopathic facial<symptom> pain<symptom> patients had lower short-interval intracortical inhibition compared with controls. These changes were correlated with some aspects of quality of life , and higher mood symptoms. These neurophysiological alterations were not influenced by analgesic medication , as similar changes were observed in patients with or without central-acting drugs. Conclusions Persistent idiopathic facial<symptom> pain<symptom> is associated with changes in intracortical modulation involving GABAergic mechanisms , which may be related to certain aspects of the pathophysiology of this chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> condition.
