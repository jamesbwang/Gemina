  Baclofen has shown promise in the treatment of alcohol dependence. However , its precise ( neuro-) psychological working mechanism is still under debate. This study aimed to get a better understanding of baclofen 's working mechanism by examining the effect of baclofen on cognitive biases. It was hypothesized that baclofen , compared to placebo , would lead to weaker cognitive biases. Furthermore , given a suggested anxiolytic effect of baclofen , we expected that anxiety<symptom> would moderate this effect. From a larger randomized clinical trial ( RCT) with 151 participants , a subset of 143 detoxified alcohol-dependent patients , either taking baclofen or placebo , was examined. Attentional bias for alcohol ( 500 and 1500 ms) , alcohol approach tendencies , implicit alcohol-relaxation associations and trait anxiety<symptom> were assessed before the administration of baclofen or placebo. Four weeks later , 94 patients were still abstinent ( 53 in the baclofen and 41 in the placebo condition) and cognitive biases were assessed again. At baseline , patients showed a vigilance-avoidance pattern for the attentional bias ( at 500 and 1500 ms , respectively) and alcohol-negative associations. After 4 weeks , an indication for an attentional bias away from alcohol at 500 ms was found only in the baclofen group; however , cognitive biases did not differ significantly between treatment groups. No moderating role of anxiety<symptom> on cognitive biases was found. Baclofen did not lead to a differential change in cognitive biases compared with placebo , and trait anxiety<symptom> levels did not moderate this. A better understanding of the working mechanism of baclofen and predictors of treatment success would allow prescribing of baclofen in a more targeted manner.
