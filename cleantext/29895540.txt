  Oral lesions<symptom> can have widely variable aetiology , hence , the importance of a comprehensive history and oral examination. We describe the case of a 47-year-old man who presented with an incidental erythematous lesion<symptom> of the soft palate. The diagnosis was established during a routine dental examination. We found the lesion<symptom> to be associated with the practice of fellatio. Oral sex is a very common sexual practice , and as clinicians we should consider it as a potential cause of palatal lesions<symptom> in our differential diagnosis. This should also raise our suspicion for sexually transmitted diseases in high-risk patients.
