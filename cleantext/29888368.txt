  We report a series of Eu-substituted methylammonium lead tribromide quantum dots ( MAPb1-xEuxBr3 QDs). The crystallinity of these QDs increases with increasing Eu content , while there is only a small change in the lattice constant , and the morphology of the MAPb1-xEuxBr3 QDs is unaffected by the Eu content. This demonstrates that Eu is a suitable element for substituting Pb while retaining the original crystal structure. We observe blue photoluminescence ( PL) consistent with Eu2 + , which , at high Eu content ( x = 0.3) , contributes luminescence intensity equal to the green PL of unsubstituted MAPbBr3 QDs. As Eu is a less toxic substitute for Pb , that also provides blue luminescence , MAPb1-xEuxBr3 QDs may prove to be a valuable optoelectronic material.
