  Rational planning of community policies and programs ( CPPs) to prevent obesity requires an understanding of CPP objectives associated with dietary behaviours. The objective of the study is to identify objectives of CPPs associated with healthful dietary behaviours. An observational study identified 4026 nutrition CPPs occurring in 130 communities in the prior 6 years. Dietary intakes of fruits and vegetables , added sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages , among others , were reported among 5138 children 4-15 years of age from the communities , using a Dietary Screener Questionnaire with children age 9 years and older ( parent assisted) or parent proxies for younger children. CPPs were documented through key informant interviews and characterized by their intensity , count , and objectives including target dietary behaviour and food environment change strategy. Associations between dietary intakes and CPP objectives were assessed using hierarchical statistical models. CPPs with the highest intensity scores that targeted fast food or fat intake or provided smaller portions were associated with greater fruit and vegetable intake ( 0.21 , 0.19 , 0.23 cup equivalents/day respectively with p values < 0.01 , 0.04 , 0.03). CPPs with the highest intensity scores that restricted the availability of less healthful foods were associated with lower child intakes of total added sugar ( -1.08 tsp/day , p < 0.01) and sugar from sugar-sweetened beverages ( -1.63 tsp/day , p = 0.04). Similar associations were observed between CPP count and dietary outcomes. No other significant associations were found between CPP target behaviours or environmental strategies and dietary intakes/behaviours. CPPs that targeted decreases in intakes of less healthful foods and/or aimed to modify the availability of less healthful foods and portions were associated with healthier child dietary behaviours.
