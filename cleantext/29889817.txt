  It was demonstrated that α1 adrenergic receptor ( α1-AR) activation by phenylephrine ( PE) attenuated cardiac dysfunction in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- challenged mice. However , it is unclear whether PE suppresses sepsis-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Here , we investigated the effects of PE on cardiomyocyte apoptosis in LPS-treated adult rat ventricular myocytes ( ARVMs) and septic rats induced by cecal ligation and puncture. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis and caspase activity were detected by TUNEL and spectrophotometrical assay , respectively. Bax , Bcl-2 and cytochrome c ( Cyt c) as well as IκBα , ERK1/2 , p38 MAPK , JNK and cardiac troponin I ( cTnI) phosphorylation were analyzed by Western blotting , and TNF-α concentration was analyzed by ELISA. PE inhibited LPS-induced caspase-3 activation in ARVMs , which was reversed by prazosin ( a membrane permeable α1-AR antagonist) , but not by CGP12177A ( a membrane impermeable α1-AR antagonist). PE up-regulated phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Bcl-2 contents , decreased TNF-α and Bax levels , Cyt c release , caspase-8/ -9 activities as well as IκBα , p38MAPK and JNK phosphorylation in LPS-treated ARVMs , all of which were abolished by prazosin. Treatment with U0126 ( a specific ERK1/2 inhibitor) reversed the effects of PE on IκBα , p38MAPK and JNK phosphorylation as well as caspase-3/ -8/ -9 activation in LPS-treated ARVMs. In septic rats , PE not only inhibited myocardial apoptosis as well as IκBα , p38MAPK and JNK phosphorylation , but also up-regulated myocardial phosphorylated ERK1/2. Furthermore , PE inhibited myocardial cTnI phosphorylation and improved cardiac function in septic rats. Taken together , our data suggest that α1-AR activation by PE inhibits sepsis-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction via activating ERK1/2 signal pathway.
