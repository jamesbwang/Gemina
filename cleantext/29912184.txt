  Dendritic cells ( DC) are heterogeneous cell populations that differ in their cell membrane markers , migration patterns and distribution , and in their antigen presentation and T cell activation capacities. Since most vaccinations of experimental tumor models require millions of DC , they are widely isolated from the bone<disease> marrow or spleen. However , these DC significantly differ from blood and tumor DC in their responses to immune complexes ( IC) , and presumably to other Syk-coupled lectin receptors. Importantly , given the sensitivity of DC to danger-associated molecules , the presence of endotoxins or antibodies that crosslink activation receptors in one of the isolating steps could result in the priming of DC and thus affect the parameters , or at least the dosage , required to activate them. Therefore , here we describe a detailed protocol for isolating MoDC from blood and tumors while avoiding their premature activation. In addition , a protocol is provided for MoDC activation with tumor IC , and their subsequent analyses.
