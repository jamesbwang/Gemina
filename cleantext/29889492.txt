  Manipulating nanoscopic objects by external stimuli is the cornerstone of nanoscience. Here , we report the implementation of dynamic covalent chemistry in the reversible binding and directional motion of fluorescent nanodiamond particles at a functionalized graphene surface via imine linkages. The dynamic connections allow for controlling the formation and rupture of these linkages by external stimuli. By introduction of pH gradients , the nanoparticles are driven to move along the gradient due to the different rates of the imine condensation and hydrolysis in the two environments. The multivalent nature of the particle-to-surface connection ensures that particles remain attached to the surface , whereas its dynamic character allows for exchange reaction , thus leading to displacement yet bound behavior in two-dimensional space. These results open a pathway for thermodynamically controlled manipulation of objects on the nanoscale.
