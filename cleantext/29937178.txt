  Evidence supporting adjuvant therapy for resected pancreatic cancer is limited primarily to head tumors. We analyzed data from the National Cancer Database ( NCDB) to evaluate the relationship of tumor site with benefit from adjunctive ( adjuvant , neoadjuvant , perioperative) therapy ( Rx). All NCDB patients with clinical stage I and II pancreatic cancer , diagnosed from 2003 to 2013 , who underwent surgical resection and had data on site of primary were included. Overall survival ( OS) analyses with hazard ratios ( HR) , 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) , and two-sided p-values are presented. A total of 27,930 patients met inclusion criteria; median age 66 years , 51 % males , 86 % white. Primary site was coded as head ( 74.4 %) , body ( 9.3 %) , or tail ( 16.3 %). Pathologic stage was predominantly stage II ( 77 %); 81 % had negative margins. Perioperative Rx was used in 4 % , neoadjuvant in 8 % , adjuvant in 48 %. Median OS for the cohort was 24 months; for head , body and tail tumors , it was 21.6 , 34.5 , and 42.5 months , respectively. In univariable analyses , adjunctive Rx was associated with improved OS in head tumors ( HR , any Rx vs. no Rx: 0.87; 95 % CI 0.84-0.91; p < 0.0001) but not in body ( 1.82; 1.59-2.08; < 0.0001) and tail ( 2.28; 2.05-2.53; < 0.0001) tumors; multivariable models including statistically significant predictors ( Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score , tumor grade and stage , positive resection margin) confirmed these results. Our study suggests that the benefit of adjunctive Rx is restricted to pancreatic head tumors; body and tail tumors have a much better prognosis. These results warrant further evaluation in prospective studies.
