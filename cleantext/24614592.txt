  Verinurad ( RDEA3170) is a selective uric acid reabsorption inhibitor in clinical development for treatment of gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. This study evaluated verinurad pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , and tolerability in healthy Japanese and non-Asian adult male subjects. This was a Phase I , randomized , single-blind , placebo-controlled study. Panels of 8 Japanese subjects were randomized to receive oral verinurad ( 2.5-15 mg) or placebo administered as a single dose in a fasted and fed state and as once-daily doses for 7 days in a fed state. Eight non-Asian subjects received verinurad 10 mg as a single dose ( fasted and fed) and multiple doses in the fed state. Serial plasma/serum and urine samples were assayed for verinurad and uric acid. Safety was assessed by adverse events and laboratory data. Of 48 randomized subjects , 46 ( Japanese , 39; non-Asian , 7) completed the study. Following single or multiple doses in Japanese subjects , maximum plasma concentration ( Verinurad monotherapy lowered serum urate and was well tolerated in both healthy Japanese and non-Asian males , while small differences in plasma pharmacokinetics were observed. These data support further evaluation of once-daily verinurad as a treatment for gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia.
