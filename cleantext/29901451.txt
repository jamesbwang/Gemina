  Highly crystalline indium tin oxide ( ITO) nanowires were grown via a vapor-liquid-solid method , with thermal tolerance up to ∼ 1300 °C. We report the electric and thermoelectric properties of the ITO nanowires before and after heat treatments and draw conclusions about their applicability as thermoelectric building blocks in nanodevices that can operate in high temperature conditions. The Seebeck coefficient and the thermal and electrical conductivities were measured in each individual nanowire by means of specialized micro-bridge thermometry devices. Measured data was analyzed and explained in terms of changes in charge carrier density , impurities and vacancies due to the thermal treatments.
