  The non-invasive biomarkers of migraine can help to develop the personalized medication of this disorder. In testing of the antimigraine drugs the capsaicin-induced skin redness with activated TRPV1 receptors in sensory neurons associated with the release of the migraine mediator CGRP has already been widely used. Fourteen migraine patients ( mean age 34.6 ± 10.2 years) and 14 healthy volunteers ( mean age 29.9 ± 9.7 years) participated in the experiment. A new arrangement of imaging photoplethysmography recently developed by us was used here to discover novel sensitive parameters of dermal blood flow during capsaicin applications in migraine patients. Blood pulsation amplitude ( BPA) observed as optical-intensity waveform varying synchronously with heartbeat was used for detailed exploration of microcirculatory perfusion induced by capsicum patch application. The BPA signals , once having appeared after certain latent period , were progressively rising until being saturated. Capsaicin-induced high BPA areas were distributed unevenly under the patch , forming `` hot spots. '' Interestingly the hot spots were much more variable in migraine patients than in the control group. In contrast to BPA , a slow component of waveforms related to the skin redness changed significantly less than BPA highlighting the latter parameter as the potential sensitive biomarker of capsaicin-induced activation of the blood flow. Thus , in migraine patients , there is a non-uniform ( both in space and in time) reaction to capsaicin , resulting in highly variable openings of skin capillaries. BPA dynamics measured by imaging photoplethysmography could serve as a novel sensitive non-invasive biomarker of migraine-associated changes in microcirculation.
