  Magnification of visual feedback ( VF) impairs force control in older adults. In this study , we aimed to determine whether the age-associated increase in force variability with magnification of visual feedback is a consequence of increased amplitude or speed of visual feedback. Seventeen young and 18 older adults performed a constant isometric force task with the index finger at 5 % of MVC. We manipulated the vertical ( force gain) and horizontal ( time gain) aspect of the visual feedback so participants performed the task with the following VF conditions: ( 1) high amplitude-fast speed; ( 2) low amplitude-slow speed; ( 3) high amplitude-slow speed. Changing the visual feedback from low amplitude-slow speed to high amplitude-fast speed increased force variability in older adults but decreased it in young adults ( P < 0.01). Changing the visual feedback from low amplitude-slow speed to high amplitude-slow speed did not alter force variability in older adults ( P > 0.2) , but decreased it in young adults ( P < 0.01). Changing the visual feedback from high amplitude-slow speed to high amplitude-fast speed increased force variability in older adults ( P < 0.01) but did not alter force variability in young adults ( P > 0.2). In summary , increased force variability in older adults with magnification of visual feedback was evident only when the speed of visual feedback increased. Thus , we conclude that in older adults deficits in the rate of processing visual information and not deficits in the processing of more visual information impair force control.
