  One of the newly developed methods for Assimilable organic carbon ( AOC) determination is leveraged on the cell enumeration by flow cytometry ( FC) which could provide a rapid and automated solution for AOC measurement. However , cell samples staining with fluorescence dye is indispensable to reduce background and machine noise. This step would bring additional cost and time consuming for this method. In this study , a green fluorescence protein ( GFP) tagged strain derived of AOC testing strain Pseudomonas<pathogen> fluorescens<pathogen> P-17 ( GFP-P17) was generated using Tn5 transposon mutagenesis. Continuous culture of this mutant GFP-P17 showed stable expression of eGFP signal detected by flow cytometry without staining step. In addition , this GFP-P17 strain displayed faster growth rate and had a wider range of carbon substrate utilization patterns as compared with P17 wild-type. With this strain , the capability of a new FC method with no dye staining was explored in standard acetate solution , which suggests linear correlation of counts with acetate carbon concentration. Furthermore , this FC method with GFP-P17 strain is applicable in monitoring GAC/BAC efficiency and condition as similar trends of AOC level in water treatment process were measured by both FC method and conventional spread plating count method. Therefore , this fast and easily applicable GFP-P17 based FC method could serve as a tool for routine microbiological drinking water monitoring.
