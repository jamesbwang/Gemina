  Natural killer ( NK) cells have exhibited promising efficacy in inhibiting cancer growth. We aimed to explorer the effect of NK cells on oxaliplatin-resistant colorectal cancer and the underlying molecular mechanism. Oxaliplatin-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines were co-cultured with NK cells to evaluate the effect on viability , proliferation , migration and invasion
