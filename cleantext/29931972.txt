  Here , we report the synthesis of ( multi)- layered zeolitic imidazolate framework ( ZIF-8/ -67) composite particles via a sequential deconstruction-reconstruction process. We show that this process can be applied to construct ZIF-8-on-ZIF-67 composite particles whose cores are the initially etched particles. In addition , we demonstrate that introduction of functional inorganic nanoparticles ( INPs) onto the crystal surface of etched particles does not disrupt ZIF particle reconstruction , opening new avenues for designing ( multi)- layered ZIF-on-INP-on-ZIF composite particles comprising more than one class of inorganic nanoparticles. In these latter composites , the location of the inorganic nanoparticles inside each single metal-organic framework particle as well as of their separation at the nanoscale ( 20 nm) is controlled. Preliminary results show that ( multi)- layered ZIF-on-INP-on-ZIF composite particles comprising a good sequence of inorganic nanoparticles can potentially catalyze cascade reactions.
