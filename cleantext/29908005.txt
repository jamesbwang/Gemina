  To introduce the Laboratory Quality Stepwise Implementation ( LQSI) tool and provide data about its roll-out , usage and effectiveness in assisting laboratories with quality improvement. The LQSI tool , a freely available stepwise guide , was developed by WHO to assist laboratories with efficiently implementing a quality management system. Since the tool 's launch in 2014 , it has been accessed by 130 986 unique users from 195 of 206 listed states. Of 35 respondents to a survey , 12 ( 34 %) indicated that their laboratory had been able to achieve accreditation/certification/licensing as a result of using the tool. The LQSI tool , currently being used worldwide and available in English , French , Russian , Spanish , Arabic and Turkish , positively impacts the quality of services provided by clinical and public health laboratories , leading to improved clinical care and disease surveillance capacity as required by the IHR ( 2005) and envisioned by the Global Health Security Agenda.
