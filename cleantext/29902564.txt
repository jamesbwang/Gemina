  Our study proposes the use of a frequency-modulated acquisition which suppresses banding artefacts in combination with a phase-sensitive water-fat separation algorithm. The performance of the phase-sensitive separation for standard bSSFP , complex sum combination thereof , and frequency-modulated bSSFP were compared in in vivo measurements of the upper and lower legs at 1.5 and 3 T. It is shown , that the standard acquisition suffered from banding artefacts and major swaps between tissues. The dual-acquisition bSSFP could alleviate banding artefacts and only minor swaps occurred , but it comes at the expense of a doubled acquisition. In the frequency-modulated acquisitions all banding artefacts and the associated phase jumps were eliminated and no swaps between tissues occurred. It therefore provides a means to robustly separate water and fat , in one single radial bSSFP scan , using the phase-sensitive approach , even in the presence of high field inhomogeneities.
