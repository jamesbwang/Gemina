  Direct evidence of paleoecological processes is often rare when the fossil record is poor , as in the case of the Cretaceous of eastern North<pathogen> America. Here , I describe a femur and partial tibia shaft assignable to theropods from two Late Cretaceous sites in New Jersey. The former , identifiable as the femur of a large ornithomimosaur , bears several scores interpreted as shark feeding traces. The tibia shaft has punctures and flaked bone from the bites of mid-sized crocodyliforms , the first documented occurrence of crocodyliform traces on dinosaur bone from the Maastrichtian of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The surface of the partial tibia is also littered with indentations interpreted as the traces of invertebrates , revealing a microcosm of biological interaction on the coastal seafloor of the Cretaceous Atlantic Ocean. Massive crocodyliforms , such as
