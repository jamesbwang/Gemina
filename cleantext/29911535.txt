  A 22-year-old student presented with a 3-year history of hyperpigmented , minimally pruritic skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> over his trunk. They had begun as small discrete macules over the left side of the trunk , with some coalescing to form patches. He had had right-sided segmental vitiligo ( SV) for the previous 7 to 8 years ( Figure 1A) , and this had started to cross the midline , covering a margin over the left side of the chest and back. This coincided with the onset and spread of the hyperpigmented patches. He denied any history of drug intake , or history of inflammatory dermatoses at either the vitiliginous or the hyperpigmented sites.
