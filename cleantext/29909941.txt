  To explore the clinical characteristics and motor activity profile during sleep periods of children and adolescents presenting with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder ( DMDD). Twenty-one youths ( mean age ± standard deviation , 11.7 ± 3 years) wore a wrist actigraph for 9 consecutive days ( including both school days and non-school days) , to measure sleep parameters: sleep latency , sleep efficiency and the number and duration of periods of wakefulness after sleep onset ( WASO). We divided the night-time actigraphy recording sessions into three sections and compared the first and last thirds of the night. All the study participants had a psychiatric comorbidity ( primarily attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , depressive disorder or anxiety<symptom> disorder). On non-school days , bedrest onset and activity onset were shifted later by about 1h. There was no significant difference between school days and non-school days with regard to the total sleep time. Sleep efficiency was significantly greater on non-school days. Sleep was fragmented on both school days and non-school days. The mean number of episodes of WASO was 24.9 for school days and 30.9 for non-school days. Relative to the first third of the night , we observed a significantly greater number of episodes of WASO during the last third of the night , a period associated with a larger proportion of rapid eye movement<symptom> ( REM) sleep. Sleep appeared to be fragmented in the study population of youths with DMDD. The greater frequency of WASO in the last third of the night points to a possible impairment of the motor inhibition normally associated with REM sleep.
