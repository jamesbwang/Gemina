  The curing of a testicular tumour is currently feasible in more than 95 % of patients , and in 80 % of those with metastases. Until now , there has been no study or series of cases that describe the ocular changes of the posterior segment associated with testicular cancer. To evaluate patients with a diagnosis of testicular cancer in order to determine the presence of changes in the posterior segment and the relationship to the stage. An observational , cross-sectional , and descriptive study was conducted on 21 male patients ( 42 eyes) with a diagnosis of testicular cancer. Age , histological type , time of evolution , stage , treatment , and comorbidities were recorded , as well as visual acuity measurement ( LogMAR) , biomicroscopy of the anterior segment , and photographic records of the posterior pole and peripheral retina. The mean age was 29 years ( 18-43 years). All ( 100 %) of the patients were treated surgically. The most frequent histological type was classic seminoma ( 42.8 %) , followed by the mixed germinal tumour ( 38.0 %). At the time of evaluation , 42.8 % of patients had a stage II , and 23.8 % had distant metastasis. The changes in the posterior segment were: vascular tortuosity ( 14.2 %) , retinopathy associated with cancer ( 9.5 %) , choroidal metastasis ( 9.5 %) , pigmentary changes of the retinal pigment epithelium ( 9.5 %) , and retinal metastasis ( 4.7 %). It is possible to find changes at the level of retinal pigment epithelium , as well as vascular tortuosity , retinopathy associated with cancer , and choroidal and/or retina metastases.
