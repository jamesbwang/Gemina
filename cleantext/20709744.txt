  Dabigatran , a new oral anticoagulant , is a direct thrombin inhibitor used as an alternative to warfarin to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism with nonvalvular atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. We report a case of a man who resumed dabigatran after 6 weeks of prior therapy and began experiencing hematuria<symptom> with worsening kidney function. Renal biopsy with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy showed mesangial deposits consistent with immunoglobulin A nephropathy. With discontinuation of dabigatran and addition of methylprednisolone , the gross hematuria<symptom> cleared and urine output improved.
