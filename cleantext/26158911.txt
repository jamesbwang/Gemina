  Urban trees have long been valued for providing ecosystem services ( mitigation of the `` heat island<disease> '' effect , suppression of air pollution , etc.); more recently the potential of urban forests to store significant above ground biomass ( AGB) has also be recognised. However , urban areas pose particular challenges when assessing AGB due to plasticity of tree form , high species diversity as well as heterogeneous and complex land cover. Remote sensing , in particular light detection and ranging ( LiDAR) , provide a unique opportunity to assess urban AGB by directly measuring tree structure. In this study , terrestrial LiDAR measurements were used to derive new allometry for the London Borough of Camden , that incorporates the wide range of tree structures typical of an urban setting. Using a wall-to-wall airborne LiDAR dataset , individual trees were then identified across the Borough with a new individual tree detection ( ITD) method. The new allometry was subsequently applied to the identified trees , generating a Borough-wide estimate of AGB. Camden has an estimated median AGB density of 51.6 Mg ha Over the coming century global populations are predicted to become increasingly urbanised , leading to an unprecedented expansion of urban land cover. Urban areas will become more important as carbon sinks and effective tools to assess carbon densities in these areas are therefore required. Using multi-scale LiDAR presents an opportunity to achieve this , providing a spatially explicit map of urban forest<disease> structure and AGB.
