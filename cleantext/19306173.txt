  To identify potentially actionable dosimetric predictors of local control ( LC) for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) brain metastases treated with single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS). Patients with NSCLC brain metastases treated with single-fraction SRS were identified. Eligible patients had at least 1 follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scan and were without prior metastasectomy or SRS to the same lesion<symptom>. LC and overall survival ( OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate ( UVA) and multivariate analysis ( MVA). Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) analysis was used to identify optimal cut points for dose-volume histogram metrics relative to LC. A total of 612 NSCLC brain metastasis were identified in 299 patients with single-fraction SRS between 1999 and 2014. Median follow-up was 10 months. Median OS from time of SRS was 11 months. Overall LC was 75 % and 66 % at 1 and 2 years , respectively. On UVA , increasing dose by any measure was associated with improved LC. On MVA , volume receiving at least 32 Gy ( V32; hazard ratio ( HR) , 0.069; Volume , prescription isodose line , and V32 are independent predictors of LC. V32 represents an actionable SRS treatment planning parameter for NSCLC brain metastases.
