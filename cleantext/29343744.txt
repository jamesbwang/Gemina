  The AlGaN/GaN heterostructure field-effect transistors with different gate lengths were fabricated. Based on the chosen of the Hamiltonian of the system and the additional polarization charges , two methods to calculate PCF scattering by the scattering theory were presented. By comparing the measured and calculated source-drain resistances , the effect of the different gate lengths on the PCF scattering potential was confirmed.
