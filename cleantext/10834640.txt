  3D printed patient specific vascular models provide the ability to perform precise and repeatable benchtop experiments with simulated physiological blood flow conditions. This approach can be applied to CT-derived patient geometries to determine coronary flow related parameters such as Fractional Flow Reserve ( FFR). To demonstrate the utility of this approach we compared bench-top results with non-invasive CT-derived FFR software based on a computational fluid dynamics algorithm and catheter based FFR measurements. Twelve patients for whom catheter angiography was clinically indicated signed written informed consent to CT Angiography ( CTA) before their standard care that included coronary angiography ( ICA) and conventional FFR ( Angio-FFR). The research CTA was used first to determine CT-derived FFR ( Vital Images) and second to generate patient specific 3D printed models of the aortic root and three main coronary arteries that were connected to a programmable pulsatile pump. Benchtop FFR was derived from pressures measured proximal and distal to coronary stenosis using pressure transducers. All 12 patients completed the clinical study without any complication , and the three FFR techniques ( Angio-FFR , CT-FFR , and Benchtop FFR) are reported for one or two main coronary arteries. The Pearson correlation among Benchtop FFR/Angio-FFR , CT-FFR/ Benchtop FFR , and CT-FFR/ Angio-FFR are 0.871 , 0.877 , and 0.927 respectively. 3D printed patient specific cardiovascular models successfully simulated hyperemic blood flow conditions , matching invasive Angio-FFR measurements. This benchtop flow system could be used to validate CT-derived FFR diagnostic software , alleviating both cost and risk during invasive procedures.
