  The corneal epithelium is the most important structure of the ocular optical system. Recurrent corneal erosions can result from inflammation<symptom> , trauma , degeneration and dystrophies. Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy ( EBMD) , epithelial recurrent erosion dystrophy ( ERED) and Francheschetti and Meesmann 's epithelial corneal dystrophy ( MECD) can all- besides other signs and symptoms- result in more or less frequent corneal erosions. The pathomechanisms involved however are different. In EBMD , corneal erosions are facultative and clinical signs are often subtle. Aberrant basement membrane structures are associated with thinning of the epithelium and can be clinically identified as maps or fingerprints. In ERED , recurrent corneal erosions are- predominantly in the first decades of life- always present. A defect in the COL17A1 gene results in a dysfunctional hemidesmosome. In MECD , punctate corneal erosions are less frequent and result from intraepithelial microcysts which open spontaneously onto the ocular surface. Usually lubricants , therapeutic contact lenses and sometimes epithelial debridement and phototherapeutic keratectomy are the mainstay for treating corneal erosions in these three dystrophies.
