  Conflicts arise when members of one religion apply their norms to members of another religion. Two studies explored how one hundred 9- to 15-year-old Hindu and Muslim children from India reason about the scope of religious norms. Both Hindus and Muslims from a diverse Hindu-Muslim school ( Study 1) and Hindus from a homogeneous Hindu school ( Study 2) more often judged it wrong for Hindus to violate Hindu norms , compared to Muslim norms , and said the opposite for Muslims. In contrast , children judged it wrong for both Hindus and Muslims to harm others. Thus , even in a setting marred by religious conflict , children can restrict the scope of a religion 's norms to members of that religion , providing a basis for peaceful coexistence.
