  Psychoactive substance use aiming at increased performance at work or while studying , usually referred to as pharmacological cognitive enhancement ( PCE) , has been extensively researched in recent years. While large scale national studies have tried to assess the prevalence of PCE among the general population , cross-cultural comparisons have been hampered by the different definitions and designs included. In addition , the non-medical use of prescription drugs indicated to treat the symptoms of the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD) has been the focus of discussion , yet no study has addressed the association between ADHD rates , prescribing behaviour and PCE yet. The Global Drug Survey is an annually conducted anonymous web survey on substance use. Two data sets from male and female Global Drug Survey ( GDS) participants aged 16 to 65 years with no previous ADHD diagnosis were analysed to assess12-month PCE in 15 countries. GDS2015 ( n = 79,640) examined the patterns of and motives for stimulant PCE , while GDS2017 ( n = 29,758) focused on both the use of stimulant and sedative drugs for PCE RESULTS: When comparing the study samples 2015 and 2017 , PCE with prescription and illegal stimulants and modafinil increased across all countries. People who used stimulant drugs and modafinil for PCE rated the perceived effect on cognitive performance most beneficial , while alcohol was the substance with the most adverse effect. The analysis of data on stimulant use for PCE in the largest global sample highlights relatively low-risk PCE use patterns except for participants with illegal stimulant use for PCE. The globalisation of ADHD , physicians ' prescribing behaviour and changes in drug policy are likely to influence the country-specific rate of PCE among non-ADHD individuals what calls for further investigation.
