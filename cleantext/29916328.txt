  The authors of this article integrate two historically parallel yet disparate fields of nursing , caring science theory and nursing quantum leadership science. Through a nursing , discipline-specific unitary paradigm lens , intersecting principles of caring science and quantum leadership science are uncovered. The result is a model for unitary , discipline-specific , nursing healthcare leadership: Quantum Caring Healthcare Leadership. Ontological congruence is uncovered among the philosophical-ethical-theoretical principles of caring science and the unifying disciplinary structural concepts from quantum leadership. The result is a model for discipline-specific , healthcare leadership. This convergence is potentially theory-generating for both unitary science and healthcare leadership. In this model , both quantum leadership and caring science are transformed and metamorphosed into a new unitary , discipline-specific entity to guide further advancement of knowledge , theory , and discipline-specific healthcare leadership and practice.
