  As inorganic nitrogen compounds are essential for basic building blocks of life ( e.g. , nucleotides and amino acids) , the role of biological nitrogen-fixation ( BNF) is indispensible. All nitrogen fixing microbes rely on the same nitrogenase enzyme for nitrogen reduction , which is in fact an enzyme complex consists of as many as 20 genes. However , the occurrence of six genes viz. ,
