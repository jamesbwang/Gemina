  The standard addition method ( SAM) based on gravimetric sample preparation was investigated as an approach for the removal or cancelling of matrix effects in measurements by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS). Deduction of the equations and experimental confirmation of the method are both given in the present work. After measuring both spiked and non-spiked samples by ICP-MS , the concentration of an element could be calculated based on the signal intensity ratio to an internal standard. A practical example was provided for the measurement of Fe in a certified reference material ( CRM) , i.e. NMIJ CRM 7512-a ( milk powder). The validity of the method had been confirmed by the results of international comparisons with various kinds of matrix , including bioethanol , human serum , biodiesel fuel , drinking water , infant formula milk power , and seafood. The suggested method had been applied to measurements of multiple elements in three CRMs , including tap water , milk powder , and tea leave powder , respectively.
