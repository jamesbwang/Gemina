  The mechanical environment can influence cell behaviour , including changes to transcriptional and proteomic regulation , morphology and , in the case of stem cells , commitment to lineage. However , current tools for characterizing substrates ' mechanical properties , such as atomic force microscopy ( AFM) , often do not fully recapitulate the length and time scales over which cells ` feel ' substrates. Here , we show that an immortalised , clonal line of human mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) maintains the responsiveness to substrate mechanics observed in primary cells , and can be used as a reporter of stiffness. MSCs were cultured on soft and stiff polyacrylamide hydrogels. In both primary and immortalised MSCs , stiffer substrates promoted increased cell spreading , expression of lamin-A/C and translocation of mechano-sensitive proteins YAP1 and MKL1 to the nucleus. Stiffness was also found to regulate transcriptional markers of lineage. A GFP-YAP/RFP-H 2B reporter construct was designed and virally delivered to the immortalised MSCs for in situ detection of substrate stiffness. MSCs with stable expression of the reporter showed GFP-YAP to be colocalised with nuclear RFP-H2B on stiff substrates , enabling development of a cellular reporter of substrate stiffness. This will facilitate mechanical characterisation of new materials developed for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.
