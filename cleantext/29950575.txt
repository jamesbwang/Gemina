  This paper addresses an important topic , energy poverty in healthcare facilities. We try to provide an interesting perspective on bringing together two SDGs. The SDG 7 , which seeks to ensure access to affordable , sustainable , and modern energy for all , is interlinked with Goal 3 on Health. The literature studies as well as data on the subject are sparse. Nevertheless , a systematic documentation of the levels and variation in access to energy at the health-facility level is important for designing effective policies to improve the quality of healthcare and the ultimate health of the population. Using the 2012-2013 Senegal Service Provision Assessment ( SCSPA) , we assessed energy access in health facilities and health systems ' performance. Data were also geocoded using ArcGIS 10.3 to give a snapshot of the situation.
