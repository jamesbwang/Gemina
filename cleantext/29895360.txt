  Wilson disease ( WD) is a rare genetic disorder of the copper metabolism leading to systemic copper accumulation , predominantly in the liver. The therapeutic approach in WD patients is the generation of a negative copper balance<symptom> and the maintenance of copper homeostasis , currently by the use of copper chelators such as D-penicillamine ( D-PA). However , in circumstances of delayed diagnosis , poor treatment compliance , or treatment failure , mortality is almost certain without hepatic transplantation. Moreover , even after years of D-PA treatment , high liver copper levels are present in WD patients. We have recently suggested the use of the bacterial peptide Methanobactin ( MB) , which has an outstanding binding affinity for copper , as potentially efficient and patient-friendly remedy against copper damage in WD. Here we substantiate these findings considerably , by demonstrating a significant removal of copper from liver samples of WD rats upon short , one week only , MB treatments. Using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry with a spatial resolution down to 4 Î¼m , we demonstrate that only small copper hotspots remain in MB treated animal livers. We further demonstrate in WD rat liver , seven weeks after the stopped MB treatment , a lower liver copper concentration as compared to untreated control animals. Thus , MB highly efficiently depletes liver copper overload with a sustained therapeutic effect.
