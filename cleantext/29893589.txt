  The study investigated different sport field properties influence on muscular recruitment patterns and metabolic response during a series of running and agility drills. Eleven male athletes were fitted with a standard multi-purpose training shoe. The test protocol consisting of four high-intensity trials with 60 seconds rest between trials performed on two fields with different properties. Time-dependent field properties were recorded using ASTM protocol ( F-1936). A 30-meter pretest and posttest sprint determined fatigue<symptom> and player performance. EMG recorded muscle activity for vastus medialis ( VM) , biceps femoris ( BF) , gastrocnemius medial head ( MG) , and tibialis anterior ( TA); and metabolic activity analyzed maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2max) , heart rate ( HR) , respiratory exchange ratio ( RER) , metabolic equivalent ( MET) , and energy expenditure ( EE). A difference was calculated for muscle activity across trials ( ρ = .01) for both surfaces. Muscle activity was < 13 % on the field with less energy return ( ρ = .01). Metabolic components ( VO Our findings indicate field mechanical properties influence muscle activation patterns. The field demonstrating the greatest magnitude of energy return produces the lowest sprint and agility course times , however , performing on a field exhibiting unfamiliar mechanical properties could cause the athlete to produce atypical movement patterns that might contribute to overuse of the neuromuscular system.
