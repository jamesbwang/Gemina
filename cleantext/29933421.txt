  Unveil the perception of students from basic education about drugs. Phenomenological study based on Maurice Merleau-Ponyt , conducted with 14 students of a school in Bahia , Brazil , through the Focus Group , in the months of April to June of 2013. The reports have been analyzed based on the Ambiguity Analytics technique. They have been presented in the form of three categories: common sense and scientific knowledge occupy opposite locus; drug addicts; the good and evil of legal and illegal drugs. The students ' perception of drugs intertwined with scientific knowledge and at the same time placing it at the center of the phenomenon , separating the lawful as good and illicit as bad , which points to the need for socio-educational measures among educators , students and family members , aimed at the decentralization of the drug place in the context in which the phenomenon happens so that we understand the complexity involved in the theme.
