  The skeletal musculature of gnathostomes , which is derived from embryonic somites , consists of epaxial and hypaxial portions. Some hypaxial muscles , such as tongue and limb<symptom> muscles , undergo de-epithelialization and migration during development. Delamination and migration of these myoblasts , or migratory muscle precursors ( MMPs) , is generally thought to be regulated by hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF) and receptor tyrosine kinase ( MET) signaling. However , the prevalence of this mechanism and the expression patterns of the genes involved in MMP development across different vertebrate species remain elusive. We performed a comparative analysis of Our results indicate that the expressions and functions of both
