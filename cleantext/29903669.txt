  Coronary artery dilatation ( CAD) is a great concern with Kawasaki disease ( KD). This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP) levels and CAD in patients with the hyperacute phase ( ≤ 4 days of fever<disease> of KD. Serum NT-proBNP levels were compared between patients with and those without CAD , who underwent transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE) within 24 h of the hyperacute phase of KD in the pediatric emergency department ( PED). Electronic medical records of patients aged 1 month to 15 years who visited the PED were retrospectively assessed from January 2010 to December 31 , 2014. One hundred nine patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty-three of those patients had CAD within 24 h of TTE. Median serum NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in patients with CAD ( 824.1 pg/ml; interquartile range ( IQR) , 515.4-1570.0184.8-767.8 pg/ml) than in patients without CAD ( 396.4 pg/ml; IQR , 184.8-767.8 pg/ml) ( p ≤ 0.001). The cutoff value of serum NT-proBNP , which predicted CAD during the hyperacute phase of KD , was 515.4 pg/ml , which yielded sensitivity of 78.26 % and specificity of 61.63 %. The area under the curve for NT-proBNP for predicting CAD during hyperacute KD was 0.749 ( 95 % CI , 0.642-0.856). Serum NT-proBNP might be an additional laboratory marker for detecting early CAD during the hyperacute phase of KD in the PED.
