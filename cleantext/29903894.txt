  Acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) is a rapidly progressive , poor-prognosis malignancy arising from hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The long history of successful use of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( alloHCT) in AML indicates that this disease is immunoresponsive , leading to optimism that novel immunotherapies such as bispecific antibodies , chimeric antigen receptor T cells , and immune checkpoint inhibitors will generate meaningful disease control. However , emerging data on the immunoevasive tactics employed by AML blasts at diagnosis and at relapse indicate that optimism must be tempered by an understanding of this essential paradox. Furthermore , AML has a low mutational burden , thus presenting few neoantigens for attack by autologous T cells even after attempted reversal of inhibitory receptor/ligand interactions. In this review we outline the known AML targets , explore immune evasion mechanisms , and describe recent data and current clinical trials of single and combination immunotherapies.
