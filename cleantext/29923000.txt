  The dynamics of LPO marker malondialdehyde formation and peroxidase-destroying activity was studied in homogenized organs of guinea pigs , immunized with thermoextracts from S and L forms Brucella<pathogen> abortus I-206. The L form brucella<pathogen> thermoextract exhibited a lower reactogenicity and adequately activated the antioxidant system , due to which the destructive effects of ROS could be partially neutralized during the vaccinal process.
