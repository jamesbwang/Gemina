  In vivo , tip-growing plant cells need to overcome a series of physical barriers; however , researchers lack the methodology to visualize cellular behavior in such restrictive conditions. To address this issue , we have developed growth chambers for tip-growing plant cells that contain a series of narrow , micro-fabricated gaps ( ~ 1 µm) in a poly-dimethylsiloxane ( PDMS) substrate. This transparent material allows the user to monitor tip elongation processes in individual cells during microgap penetration by time-lapse imaging. Using this experimental platform , we observed morphological changes in pollen tubes as they penetrated the microgap. We captured the dynamic changes in the shape of a fluorescently labeled vegetative nucleus and sperm cells in a pollen tube during this process. Furthermore , we demonstrated the capability of root hairs and moss protonemata to penetrate the 1 µm gap. This in vitro platform can be used to study how individual cells respond to physically constrained spaces and may provide insights into tip-growth mechanisms.
