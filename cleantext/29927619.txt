  The aims of this study were to extend the current literature on school climate that is focused on understanding how teacher , administrator , and student perceptions about driving-focused aspects of the social , educational , and institutional climate of schools can affect students ' achievement , behavior , and adjustment towards the development of the concept of school safe driving climate ( SSDC) and initiate the development of tools and processes for assessing SSDC. A mixed-methods approach was used to develop an initial version of a survey-based measure of SSDC that involved self-report surveys ( students) and in-depth interviews ( teachers). Exploratory factor analytic procedures identified SSDC constructs and a regression framework was used to examine associations among SSDC constructs and self-reported driver behaviors. Qualitative data were subjected to inductive analysis , with a goal of elucidating teachers ' perspectives on SSDC and an SSDC intervention. The study sample consisted of 947 adolescents ( 48 % male) from one large high school and 44 teacher advisors. Participants were recruited from a school participating in a state-wide effort to promote transportation safety through peer-led programming. Two SSDC factors were identified: Administrative Contributions to School Safety and Value of School Safety , which were associated with adolescents ' perceptions of their driving behaviors. Adolescents ' perceived that the intervention affected administrative safety. Teacher interviews contextualized these results and provided guidance on program revisions. Safe driving climate may be an important , modifiable , and measurable aspect of school climate. Additional research is needed to refine the assessment tool and to use it in longitudinal and experimental studies.
