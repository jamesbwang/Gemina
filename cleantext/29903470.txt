  The adaption of an parallel-path poly ( tetrafluoroethylene) ( PTFE) ICP-nebulizer to an evaporative light scattering detector ( ELSD) was realized. This was done by substituting the originally installed concentric glass nebulizer of the ELSD. The performance of both nebulizers was compared regarding nebulizer temperature , evaporator temperature , flow rate of nebulizing gas and flow rate of mobile phase of different solvents using caffeine and poly ( dimethylsiloxane) ( PDMS) as analytes. Both nebulizers showed similar performances but for the parallel-path PTFE nebulizer the performance was considerably better at low LC flow rates and the nebulizer lifetime was substantially increased. In general , for both nebulizers the highest sensitivity was obtained by applying the lowest possible evaporator temperature in combination with the highest possible nebulizer temperature at preferably low gas flow rates. Besides the optimization of detector parameters , response factors for various PDMS oligomers were determined and the dependency of the detector signal on molar mass of the analytes was studied. The significant improvement regarding long-term stability made the modified ELSD much more robust and saved time and money by reducing the maintenance efforts. Thus , especially in polymer HPLC , associated with a complex matrix situation , the PTFE-based parallel-path nebulizer exhibits attractive characteristics for analytical studies of polymers.
