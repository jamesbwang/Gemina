  During joint action tasks , expectations for outcomes of one 's own and other 's actions are collectively monitored. Recent evidence suggests that trait empathy levels may also influence performance monitoring processes. The present study investigated how outcome expectation and empathy interact during a turn-taking piano duet task , using simultaneous electroencephalography ( EEG) recording. During the performances , one note in each player 's part was altered in pitch to elicit the feedback-related negativity ( FRN) and subsequent P3 complex. Pianists memorized and performed pieces containing either a similar or dissimilar sequence as their partner. For additional blocks , pianists also played both sequence types with an audio-only computer partner. The FRN and P3a were larger in response to self than other , while P3b occurred only in response to self , suggesting greater online monitoring of self- compared to other-produced actions during turn-taking joint action. P3a was larger when pianists played a similar sequence as their partner. Finally , as trait empathy level increased , FRN in response to self decreased. This association was absent for FRN in response to other. This may reflect that highly-empathetic musicians during joint performance could use a strategy to suppress exclusive focus on self-monitoring.
