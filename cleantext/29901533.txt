  There is a lack of consensus regarding the yield and safety of transbronchial cryobiopsies for diagnosing diffuse parenchymal lung diseases ( DPLD). The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the diagnostic yield and safety profile of transbronchial cryobiopsies in DPLD. A literature search of MEDLINE , EMBASE databases , and Google Scholar was performed in August 2017. The quality of included studies was assessed using Quality Assessment , Data Abstraction and Synthesis-2 tool. Meta-analysis was performed using MedCalc ( version 17.2). Inverse variance weighting was used to aggregate diagnostic yield proportions across studies , with the number of subjects in each study representing its weight. Random effects model was used when significant heterogeneity was observed ( I > 40 %). A total of 31 studies were included in the review. Of these , 27 studies with 1443 patients reported data on the performance of cryobiopsies for diagnosing DPLD. The diagnostic yield was 72.9 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 67.9 % -77.7 %). The pooled mean specimen size obtained by cryobiopsies was 23.4 mm ( 95 % CI , 9.6-37.3 mm). The overall complication rate was 23.1 % with bleeding and pneumothoraces being the most commonly reported complications. The incidence of significant bleeding was 14.2 % ( 95 % CI , 7.9 % -21.9 %) , whereas pneumothorax was seen in 9.4 % ( 95 % CI , 6.7 % -12.5 %) of patients. Overall reported mortality was 0.3 %. Our meta-analysis shows that cryobiopsies have a good diagnostic yield but a significant risk for complications. Cryobiopsy outcomes vary markedly among different centers. Further research is needed to standardize the procedure and improve its safety profile.
