  To compare the outcome of the Epley maneuver ( EM) in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo<symptom> of the posterior canal ( CSP-BPPV) depending on the definition used for recovery. Multicenter observational prospective study. Otoneurology Units of 5 tertiary reference hospitals. All patients presenting with unilateral CSP-BPPV assisted for 1-year period. Spontaneous nystagmus<symptom> , positive McClure-Pagnini maneuver , positive bilateral Dix-Hallpike maneuver ( DHM) , positive DHM for vertigo<symptom> but negative for nystagmus<symptom> and atypical nystagmus<symptom>. Response to EM was measured after 7 days in 3 different outcomes: disappearance of nystagmus<symptom> during the DHM in the follow-up visit , disappearance of vertigo<symptom> during the DHM and general status ( GS) during daily life activities. 264 patients were recruited ( 68 male/166 female , mean age 62 years). After the EM , nystagmus<symptom> disappeared in 67 % of them , vertigo<symptom> in 54 % and 36 % were asymptomatic in their daily life. These outcomes were strongly correlated , but they were not concordant in a clinically significant group of cases; only the 26 % of patients met all of them. The healing process follows the next sequence: negativization of positional nystagmus<symptom> , then disappearance of positional vertigo<symptom> and , finally , the improvement of GS during daily life activities. Nowadays , healing criteria for the resolution of an PSC-BPPV episode have not been specifically defined yet. Provided that other otoneurological disorders have been ruled out , the next resolution criterion is proposed: absence of nystagmus<symptom> and specifically during control DHM and disappearance of symptoms during daily life activities.
