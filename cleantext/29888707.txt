  Cell delivery and leakage during injection remains a challenge for cell-based intervertebral disc regeneration strategies. Cellular microencapsulation may offer a promising approach to overcome these limitations by providing a protective niche during intradiscal injection. Electrohydrodynamic spraying ( EHDS) is a versatile one-step approach for microencapsulation of cells using a high voltage electric field. The primary objective of this work was to characterise key processing parameters such as applied voltage ( 0 , 5 , 10 or 15 kV) , emitter needle gauge ( 21 , 26 or 30 G) , alginate concentration ( 1 % , 2 % or 3 %) and flow rate ( 50 , 100 , 250 or 500 Î¼l min
