  Water-soluble polymers have been extensively used in all sections of the oil and gas upstream industry , but their inherent thermothinning behaviour has limited their applications in harsh environments. To address this issue , thermoviscosifying ( or `` thermothickening '') polymers ( TVPs) whose aqueous solution viscosity automatically increases upon increasing the temperature were introduced in the early 1990s. This review first recalls the background for developing such smart materials , followed by demonstrating the mechanism of thermothickening. Next , three major TVPs including N-alkyl substituted acrylamide copolymers , grafted polyethers , and cellulose derivatives are summarized with respect to their structure-property relationship , then their practical trials or potential uses in oil and gas drilling fluids , cementing slurries , hydraulic fracturing , steam flooding , and enhanced oil recovery are discussed. Finally , the advantages and disadvantages of the current TVPs are commented and future prospects are discussed to close this review.
