  Head and neck cancers consist of a heterogeneous group of cancers that are difficult to treat successfully. Limited screening options result in patients being diagnosed at advanced stages at presentation , and difficulty with treatment options and post-treatment surveillance can lead to poor outcomes. In this setting , tools for early and precise detection of disease will be highly valuable. Liquid biopsies , or use of analytes in blood , saliva , and other body fluid samples , provide new avenues for cancer screening with the potential for early detection , treatment modification , and surveillance of head and neck cancers. Early studies of liquid biopsies in specific head and neck cancers have had encouraging results. Nevertheless , various challenges remain before its routine adoption into clinical use is feasible. With continued advancement in the field of liquid biopsies , there is great promise for clinical implementation and significant improvement in head and neck cancer care.
