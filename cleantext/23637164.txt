  Accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates is a common pathology associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases and selective autophagy plays a critical role in their elimination. Although aging-related decreases in protein degradation properties may enhance protein aggregation , it remains unclear whether proteasome dysfunction is indispensable for ubiquitinated-protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases. Here , we show that N-oleoyl-dopamine and N-arachidonyl-dopamine , which are endogenous brain substances and belong to the N-acyldopamine ( AcylDA) family , generate cellular inclusions<disease> through aggresome formation without proteasome inhibition. Although AcylDA itself does not inhibit proteasome activity in vitro , it activates the rearrangement of vimentin distribution to form a vimentin cage surrounding aggresomes and sequesters ubiquitinated proteins in aggresomes. The gene transcription of p62/SQSTM1 was significantly increased by AcylDAs , whereas the transcription of other ubiquitin-dependent autophagy receptors was unaffected. Genetic depletion of p62 resulted in the loss of ubiquitinated-protein sequestration in aggresomes , indicating that p62 is a critical component of aggresomes. Furthermore , AcylDAs accelerate the aggregation of mutant huntingtin exon 1 proteins. These results suggest that aggresome formation does not require proteasome dysfunction and AcylDA-induced aggresome formation may participate in forming cytoplasmic protein
