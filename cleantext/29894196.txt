  In this study , a detailed calibration of the performance of modern ab initio wave function methods in the domain of X-ray absorption spectroscopy ( XAS) is presented. It has been known for some time that for a given level of approximation , for example , using time-dependent density functional theory ( TD-DFT) in conjunction with a given basis set , there are systematic deviations of the calculated transition energies from their experimental values that depend on the functional , the basis set , and the chosen treatment of scalar relativistic effects. This necessitates a linear correlation for a given element/functional/basis set combination to be established before chemical applications can be performed. This is a laborious undertaking since it involves sourcing trustworthy experimental data , lengthy geometry optimizations , and detailed comparisons between theory and experiment. In this work , reference values for the element-specific shifts of all the first-row transition metal atoms and the main group elements C , N , O , F , Si , P , S , and Cl have been computed by using a protocol that is based on the complete active space configuration interaction in conjunction with second-order N-electron valence state perturbation theory ( CASCI/NEVPT2). It is shown that by extrapolating the results to the basis set limit of the method and taking into account scalar relativistic effects via the second-order Douglas-Kroll-Hess ( DKH2) corrections , the predicted element shifts are on average less than 0.75 eV across all the absorption edges and a very good agreement between theory and experiment in all the studied XAS cases is observed. The transferability of these errors to molecular systems is thoroughly investigated. The constructed CASCI/NEVPT2 database of element shifts is used to evaluate the performance and to automatically calibrate prior to comparison with the experiment two commonly used methods in X-ray spectroscopy , namely , DFT/Restricted open shell configuration interaction singles ( DFT/ROCIS) and TD-DFT methods.
