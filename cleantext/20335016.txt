  Bone is the preferential site of metastasis for breast and prostate tumor. Cancer cells establish a tight relationship with the host tissue , secreting factors that stimulate or inhibit bone cells , receiving signals generated from the bone remodeling activity , and displaying some features of bone cells. This interplay between tumor and bone cells alters the physiological bone remodeling , leading to the generation of a vicious cycle that promotes bone metastasis growth. To prevent the skeletal-related events ( SRE) associated with bone metastasis , approaches to inhibit osteoclast bone resorption are reported. The bisphosphonates and Denosumab are currently used in the treatment of patients affected by bone lesions<symptom>. They act to prevent or counteract the SRE , including pathologic fractures , spinal cord compression , and pain associated with bone metastasis. However , their primary effects on tumor cells still remain controversial. In this review , a description of the mechanisms leading to the onset of bone metastasis and clinical approaches to treat them are described.
