  In a seminal theory piece , Weisz and colleagues argued that control over one 's environment was less attainable and desirable in Japan than in America. Subsequently , many scholars have extrapolated from this argument to claim broad-based cultural differences in control: that Western/individualist cultures perceive and desire more personal control over their environment than do Eastern/collectivist cultures. Yet surprisingly little empirical research has put this claim to the test. To test this notion , in Study 1 we examined perceived control over one 's life in 38 nationally representative samples ( N = 48,951). In Study 2 , we measured desire for control in community samples across 27 nations ( N = 4,726). Together , the studies show lower levels of perceived and desired control in Japan than in any other nation. Over and above the Japan effect , there was no evidence for differences in perceived or desired control between individualist and collectivist nations , or between holistic and nonholistic nations.
