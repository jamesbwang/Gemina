  Decompressive craniectomy ( DC) is a therapeutic alternative for reducing intracranial pressure after a middle cerebral artery stroke. If thrombolytic therapy is administered , craniectomy is usually postponed for at least 24 hours due to a risk of severe<symptom> bleeding<symptom>. We describe a case in which DC was performed on a 38-year-old man who received thrombolytic therapy for an ischemic stroke involving the middle cerebral artery. His neurological and hemodynamic status worsened during its administration , and DC was performed 6 hours after thrombolysis was performed. Fibrinolytic coagulopathy was successfully managed by monitoring fibrinogen levels and with the administration of cryoprecipitate and tranexamic acid.
