  Nasopharyngeal lymphoepithelioma is an undifferentiated carcinoma in a dominated lymphoplasma-histiocyte stroma. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the breast is the mammary counterpart of the lymphoepithelioma of the nasopharynx and is characterised by proliferation of poorly differentiated malignant cells within a prominent lymphoid infiltrate. It is a very rare primary carcinoma of the breast first reported in 1994 by Kumar and Kumar. Fewer than 40 cases have been reported in the English literature. In this manuscript a case of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the breast in a 57-year-old patient is reported along with a literature review on this rare entity.
