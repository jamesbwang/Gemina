  An impairment in the visual attention span ( VAS) has been suggested to hamper reading performance of individuals with dyslexia. It is not clear , however , if the very nature of the deficit is visual or verbal and , importantly , if it affects spelling skills as well. The current study investigated VAS by means of forced choice tasks with letters and symbols in a sample of third and fourth graders with age-adequate reading and spelling skills ( n = 43) , a typical dyslexia profile with combined reading and spelling deficits ( n = 26) and isolated spelling deficits ( n = 32). The task was devised to contain low phonological short-term memory load and to overcome the limitations of oral reports. Notably , eye-movements were monitored to control that children fixated the center of the display when stimuli were presented. Results yielded no main effect of group as well as no group-related interactions , thus showing that children with dyslexia and isolated spelling deficits did not manifest a VAS deficit for letters or symbols once certain methodological aspects were controlled for. The present results could not replicate previous evidence for the involvement of VAS in reading and dyslexia.
