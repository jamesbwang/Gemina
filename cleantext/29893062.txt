  Tonsils form the topographically first immune barrier of an organism against the invasion of pathogens. We used histology to study the development of tonsils of pigs after birth. At birth , the tonsils consist of diffuse lymphoid tissue without any lymphoid follicle aggregations. At the age of 7 days , lymphoid follicles appeared in the soft palate tonsil. The lymphoid layer of the nasopharyngeal tonsil , soft palate tonsil , and lingual tonsil became thicker , and lymphoid follicles in the lamina propria were clearly visible at the age of 21 days. Secondary lymphoid follicles were present in the nasopharyngeal tonsil at the age of 50 days , and in the soft palate tonsil at the age of 120 days. Dendritic cells ( DCs) , CD3
