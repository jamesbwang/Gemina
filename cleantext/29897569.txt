  Aortic calcification is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events in renal transplant recipients. This study focused on the association of abdominal aortic calcification ( AAC) and cardiovascular events assessed using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA) scoring methodology for AAC. From 2008 to 2014 , renal transplant recipients referred for a DXA procedure within 6 months after transplantation were included in a retrospective , single-centre study. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of cardiovascular events , defined as myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident or transient ischaemic attack , after transplantation. AAC was quantified using an 8-point scoring system and patients were divided into three groups; a control group ( AAC = 0) , a low AAC group ( AAC = 1-3) and a high AAC group ( AAC = 4-8). We evaluated 701 patients , 267 ( 38.1 %) had detectable calcifications ( low AAC 190 patients , high AAC 77 patients) and 434 ( 61.9 %) had no calcifications. Cardiovascular events were seen in 37 ( 8.5 %) patients in the control group , in 18 ( 9.5 %) in the low AAC group and in 20 ( 26.0 %) in the high AAC group. Univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis of the high AAC score showed a hazard ratio ( HR) of 4.23 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 2.44-7.33; P < 0.01) for cardiovascular events , while results were not significant for the low AAC score. Multivariate analysis showed an independent significant association between a high AAC score and cardiovascular events ( HR 2.78 ( 95 % CI 1.05-7.64); P = 0.04). Assessment of the continuous net reclassification index ( NRI) , comparing the combined clinical variables with a model of both AAC scoring and clinical variables , showed an NRI of 0.76 ( 95 % CI 0.65-0.86; P < 0.01). An independent association between a high AAC score , assessed by DXA , and cardiovascular events was identified and provides an opportunity for early cardiovascular risk stratification in renal transplant recipients.
