  The arrow is one of the oldest weapons invented that has ties back to ancient civilization. With the advancement of modern weaponry , literature concerning the management of this traumatic wound<disease> has dwindled. However , there are older written accounts that have led to our understanding of how we manage injuries inflicted by the arrow. One of the more comprehensive accounts was produced in the 19th century by a United States ( US) Lieutenant Colonel named JH Bill. Recent cases in forensic pathology , as well as instances of trauma concerning arrowhead injuries , have documented a lack of comprehensive literature for the management of such injuries. Thus , the goal of our review is to evaluate the literature and provide a record of the different presentations , complications , and ways to manage arrow injuries.
