  Here , we present a procedure for the synthesis of bulk and thin film multicomponent ( Mg0 .25 ( 1-x) CoxNi0 .25 ( 1-x) Cu0 .25 ( 1-x) Zn0 .25 ( 1-x)) O ( Co variant) and ( Mg0 .25 ( 1-x) Co0 .25 ( 1-x) Ni0 .25 ( 1-x) CuxZn0 .25 ( 1-x)) O ( Cu variant) entropy-stabilized oxides. Phase pure and chemically homogeneous ( Mg0 .25 ( 1-x) CoxNi0 .25 ( 1-x) Cu0 .25 ( 1-x) Zn0 .25 ( 1-x)) O ( x = 0.20 , 0.27 , 0.33) and ( Mg0 .25 ( 1-x) Co0 .25 ( 1-x) Ni0 .25 ( 1-x) CuxZn0 .25 ( 1-x)) O ( x = 0.11 , 0.27) ceramic pellets are synthesized and used in the deposition of ultra-high quality , phase pure , single crystalline thin films of the target stoichiometry. A detailed methodology for the deposition of smooth , chemically homogeneous , entropy-stabilized oxide thin films by pulsed laser deposition on ( 001)- oriented MgO substrates is described. The phase and crystallinity of bulk and thin film materials are confirmed using X-ray diffraction. Composition and chemical homogeneity are confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The surface topography of thin films is measured with scanning probe microscopy. The synthesis of high quality , single crystalline , entropy-stabilized oxide thin films enables the study of interface , size , strain , and disorder effects on the properties in this new class of highly disordered oxide materials.
