  Orbital lesions<symptom> are traditionally managed through external approaches when laterally located , and through a transnasal approach or other external approaches when medially located. However , when the lesion<symptom> is superomedially located , it may determine a technical challenge. In this study , we present the case of a patient with a superomedial intraconal venous malformation of the left eye. We addressed the mass through a combined approach , using the transnasal route as the main approach , and the superior eyelid approach to push down the lesion<symptom> to facilitate the excision. We have called this approach `` push-pull technique. '' We achieved a complete resection of the lesion<symptom> and did not observe any intraoperative or postoperative complications. The last follow-up at 6 months postoperatively showed no recurrence , and the patient was satisfied and completely recovered. According to our experience , the `` push-pull '' technique seems to be a safe procedure and might be considered a valid alternative to address selected superomedial intraconal
