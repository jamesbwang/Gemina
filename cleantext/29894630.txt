  Engineered silicon-based materials can display photoelectric and photothermal responses under light illumination , which may lead to further innovations at the silicon-biology interfaces. Silicon nanowires have small radial dimensions , promising as highly localized cellular modulators , however the single crystalline form typically has limited photothermal efficacy due to the poor light absorption and fast heat dissipation. In this work , we report strategies to improve the photothermal response from silicon nanowires by introducing nanoscale textures on the surface and in the bulk. We next demonstrate high-resolution extracellular modulation of calcium dynamics in a number of mammalian cells including glial cells , neurons , and cancer cells. The new materials may be broadly used in probing and modulating electrical and chemical signals at the subcellular length scale , which is currently a challenge in the field of electrophysiology or cellular engineering.
