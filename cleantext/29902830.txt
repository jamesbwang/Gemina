  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO) has become a routine method in thoracic surgery. Recent developments in lung transplantation have led to its widespread acceptance. Firstly , ECMO is increasingly being used to bridge patients to transplantation. The best results in this setting have been described with `` awake ECMO ''. Secondly , ECMO has replaced cardio-pulmonary bypass as the intraoperative standard device in most centres and is used for treatment and prevention of primary graft dysfunction. Refinements of the devices in use and the cannula design allow an individualised approach tailored to the respiratory and haemodynamic situation of the patients and the anticipated duration of ECMO support.
