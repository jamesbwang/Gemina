  Identifying the factors dominating ecosystem water flux is a critical step for predicting evapotranspiration ( ET). Here , the fuzzy rough set with binary shuffled frog leaping ( BSFL-FRSA) was used to identify both individual factors and multi-factor combinations that dominate the half-hourly ET variation at evergreen needleleaf forests ( ENFs) sites across three different climatic zones in the North<pathogen> America. Among 21factors , air temperature ( TA) , atmospheric CO
