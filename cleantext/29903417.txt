  Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) has challenged the assumed knowledge regarding the pathobiology of flaviviruses. Despite causing sporadic and mild disease in the 50 years since its discovery , Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> has now caused multiple outbreaks in dozens of countries worldwide. Moreover , the disease severity in recent outbreaks , with neurological disease in adult and devastating congenital malformations in fetuses , was not previously seen. One hypothesis is that the virus has acquired mutations that have increased its virulence. Indeed , mutations in other arboviruses , such as West<pathogen> Nile<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( WNV) , chikungunya<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( CHIKV) , and Venezuelan<pathogen> equine<pathogen> encephalitis<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( VEEV<pathogen>) , have enhanced outbreaks. This possibility , as well as alternative hypotheses , are explored here.
