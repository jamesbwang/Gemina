  The ShcA adaptor protein transduces oncogenic signals downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. We show here that breast tumors engage the ShcA pathway to increase their metabolism. ShcA signaling enhanced glucose catabolism through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation , rendering breast cancer cells critically dependent on glucose. ShcA signaling simultaneously increased the metabolic rate and flexibility of breast cancer cells by inducing the PGC-1α transcription factor , a central regulator of mitochondrial metabolism. Breast tumors that engaged ShcA signaling were critically dependent on PGC-1α to support their increased metabolic rate. PGC-1α deletion drastically delayed breast tumor onset in an orthotopic mouse model , highlighting a key role for PGC-1α in tumor initiation. Conversely , reduced ShcA signaling impaired both the metabolic rate and flexibility of breast cancer cells , rendering them reliant on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic reprogramming exposed a targetable metabolic vulnerability , leading to a sensitization of breast tumors to inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I ( biguanides). Genetic inhibition of ShcA signaling in the Polyoma virus middle T ( MT) breast cancer mouse model sensitized mammary tumors to biguanides during the earliest stages of breast cancer progression. Tumor initiation and growth were selectively and severely impaired in MT/ShcA-deficient animals. These data demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming is a key component of ShcA signaling and serves an unappreciated yet vital role during breast cancer initiation and progression. These data further unravel a novel interplay between ShcA and PGC-1α in the coordination of metabolic reprogramming and demonstrate the sensitivity of breast tumors to drugs targeting oxidative phosphorylation.
