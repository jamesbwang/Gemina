  Limited data from prospective studies are available to understand the natural history of ABCA4-related Stargardt disease ( STGD1). Such data are important for determining appropriate outcome measures for future STGD1 trials. To estimate the rate of loss of best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) during 2 years and to estimate the associations of BCVA loss with foveal phenotype and genotype in patients with STGD1. This multicenter prospective cohort study included 259 participants ( 489 study eyes) with molecularly confirmed STGD1 who were 6 years or older. The participants were enrolled at 9 centers in the United States and Europe and were followed up every 6 months for 2 years. Baseline BCVA and presence and type of foveal lesion<symptom> ( determined via fundus autofluorescence images) and genotype ( classified into 4 groups based on the number and pathogenicity of ABCA4 mutations). Rate of BCVA change per year. The mean ( SD) age was 33 ( 15) years. Of 259 the participants , 141 ( 54 %) were female , and 222 ( 85 %) were white. The overall rate of BCVA loss was 0.55 ( 95 % CI , 0.20-0.90) letters per year during the 2 years. Eyes with baseline BCVA worse than 20/200 showed an improvement of 0.65 ( 95 % CI , 0.1-1.2) letters per year. At baseline , the mean BCVA for eyes without foveal lesion<symptom> was 20/32 , and their BCVA change rate over time was 0.1 ( 95 % CI , -1.2 to 1.35) letters per year ( P = .89). Eyes with a foveal lesion<symptom> but having BCVA of 20/70 or better at baseline lost BCVA at a rate of 3 ( 95 % CI , 1.5-4.4) letters per year ( P < .001). Genotype was neither associated with baseline BCVA nor with the rate of BCVA change during the follow-up. A clinically small BCVA loss was observed during 2 years , and the change rate varied depending on baseline BCVA. Eyes without lesion<symptom> in the fovea had better BCVA at baseline and showed minimal change of BCVA throughout 2 years. Eyes with no or modest acuity impairment but with a foveal lesion<symptom> at baseline had the fastest loss rate. For trials of STGD1 with 2 years of duration , it may be difficult to show efficacy using BCVA as an end point owing to its slow rate of change over this time.
