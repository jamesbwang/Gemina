  The frequency of invasive fungal<disease> diseases<disease> ( IFDs) has increased in recent years. Within a context where both treatments and guidelines are fast evolving , we aim to shed new light on IFD management in hematologic departments in France. A multicenter cross-sectional observational study was prospectively conducted in 24 French centers in September and October 2013. Four hundred ninety-four hospitalized children and adult patients suffering from hematologic malignancy were enrolled: 147 ( 30 %) were allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT) recipients , 131 ( 27 %) were patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia<disease> or myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> ( MDS) , 71 ( 14 %) were patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> who did not undergo allogeneic HSCT , and the 145 ( 29 %) remaining patients did not belong to the three above groups. Two hundred forty-six patients ( 50 %) received antifungal treatment , which was prophylactic in 187 ( 76 %) treated patients. These rates were similar across all groups ( 63-80 %). Patients received prophylaxis with an azole ( 79 %) , intravenous amphotericin B formulation ( 10 %) , echinocandin ( 9 %) , or two combination drugs ( 2 %). Results indicate that prophylaxis is the leading antifungal strategy in French hematology units , regardless of the disease condition , representing 76 % of prescriptions for antifungal therapy.
