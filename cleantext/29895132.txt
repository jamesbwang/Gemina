  We are reporting a case of endometrial lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma ( LELC) in a 63-year-old female. Microscopically , the tumor consisted of groups of tumor cells surrounded by dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Immunohistochemically , the tumour cells were positive for cytokeratins AE1/AE3 , EMA , PAX8 , p16 , and estrogen receptors. Protein p53 showed an aberrant type of expression. Molecular genetic analysis revealed mutations in the TP53 and PIKP53CA genes. Based on our results , we believe that the tumor represents an unusual morphological variant of endometrial serous carcinoma.To the best of our knowledge , only six cases of LELC arising in endometrium have been reported in literature to date.
