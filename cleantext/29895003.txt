  Frailty and depression<symptom> both contribute to malnutrition and adverse clinical outcome of peritoneal dialysis ( PD) patients. However , their interaction is incompletely defined. We studied 178 adult Chinese PD patients. Physical frailty was assessed by a validated in-house questionnaire; depressive symptoms was screened by the Geriatric Depression<symptom> Scale; nutritional status was determined by subjective global assessment ( SGA) and malnutrition inflammation<symptom> score ( MIS). All patients were followed for up to 24 months for survival and hospitalization analysis. There were 111 patients ( 62.4 %) physically frail , amongst those 48 ( 43.2 %) had depressive symptoms. Only 1 patient had depressive symptoms without frailty. There was an additive effect of depressive symptoms and physical frailty on nutritional status. For the groups with no frailty , frail but no depressive symptoms , and frail with depressive symptoms , serum albumin decreased in a stepwise manner ( 35.8 ± 5.6 , 34.9 ± 4.4 , and 32.9 ± 5.3 g/L , respectively , p = 0.025); overall SGA score was 5.75 ± 0.61 , 5.41 ± 0.59 , and 5.04 ± 0.77 , respectively ( p < 0.0001) , and MIS was 5.12 ± 2.30 , 7.13 ± 3.22 , and 9.48 ± 3.97 , respectively ( p < 0.0001). At 24 months , patient survival was 86.6 % , 71.4 % , and 62.5 % for patients with no frailty , frail but no depressive symptoms , and frail with depressive symptoms , respective ( p = 0.001). The median number of hospital stay was 8.04 ( inter-quartile range ( IQR) 0.91- 19.42) , 14.05 ( IQR 3.57- 37.27) , and 26.62 ( IQR 10.65- 61.18) days per year of follow up , respectively ( p < 0.0001). Physical frailty and depressive symptoms are both common in Chinese PD patients , and they have additive adverse effect on the nutritional status and clinical outcome.
