  Ultrasound can be used to assess diaphragm movement. Existing methods focus on movement at a single point at the hemidiaphragm and may not consider the anatomic and functional complexity. We aimed to develop an ultrasound method , the Area method , to assess movement of the entire hemidiaphragm dome and to compare it with existing methods to evaluate accuracy , inter-rater agreement , and feasibility. Movement of the diaphragm was evaluated by ultrasonography in 19 healthy subjects and correlated with simultaneously performed spirometry. Two existing methods , the M-mode excursion at the posterior part of diaphragm and the B-mode at the top of the diaphragm , were compared with the Area method. Two independent raters reviewed film clips to analyze inter-rater agreement. Feasibility was tested by novice ultrasound operators. Correlation with expired lung volume was higher with the Area method , 0.88 ( 95 % CI 0.81-0.95) , p < 0.001 , and with the M-mode measurement , 0.84 ( 95 % CI 0.75-0.92) , p < 0.001 , than with the B-mode measurement , 0.71 ( 95 % CI 0.59-0.83) , p < 0.001. Inter-rater agreement was highest with the Area method , 0.9 , p < 0.001 , and M-mode measurement 0.9 , p < 0.001 , and lower with the B-mode measurement , 0.8 , p < 0.001. The M-mode measurement could be done in only 20 % at the left side. The Area method could be performed in all participants at both hemidiaphragms , and novice operators found it easy to perform. A new method to evaluate diaphragm movement is introduced. Accuracy and inter-rater agreement are high. The Area method is equally feasible at both hemidiaphragms in contrast to existing methods. However , additional studies should include more participants , different types of pulmonary diseases , and investigate the role of patient position to validate the Area method fully.
