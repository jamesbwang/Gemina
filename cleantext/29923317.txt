  The major objective of the present study was to determine the ability of a triazole fungicide tebuconazole to induce cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases , oxidative stress , and endocrine-disrupting activity using male rats treated with tebuconazole at 10 , 25 , and 50 mg/kg p.o. once daily for 28 days. In liver , tebuconazole dose-dependently increased microsomal contents of cytochrome P450 and cytochrome b
