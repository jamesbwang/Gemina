  Apigenin , a flavonoid with multiple physiological and pharmacological activities , is associated with the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The present study aimed to examine the roles and mechanisms of apigenin in the apoptosis of H9C2 rat cardiomyocytes , which were subjected to myocardial ischemia‑reperfusion ( MI/R) injury. Cell viability , reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP) and cellular apoptosis were evaluated using cell counting kit‑8 assays and flow cytometry. The content/activity of oxidative stress markers was determined using commercial kits. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to measure protein and mRNA expression , respectively. The results demonstrated that apigenin had limited cytotoxicity on the viability of H9C2 rat cardiomyocytes. Apigenin reduced the oxidative stress , ROS production and cellular apoptotic capacity of MI/R induced H9C2 cells. Apigenin additionally increased the MMP level of MI/R induced H9C2 cells. Furthermore , apigenin modulated apoptosis‑associated protein expression and phosphatidylinositol 3 '- kinase ( PI3K)/ RAC‑α serine/threonine protein kinase ( Akt) signaling in MI/R induced H9C2 cells. Treatment with LY294002 reversed the anti‑apoptotic effect of apigenin. In conclusion , apigenin suppressed the apoptosis of H9C2 cells that were subjected to MI/R injury by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. It was suggested that apigenin may be effective as an MI/R therapy.
