  Bladder cancer is the ninth common cancer in the world , the third common cancer among men in the Arabic and Western Asian countries , and the second in some regions of Iran ( a country in the Middle<pathogen> East). There was no study on the epidemiological and histological trend of bladder cancer in Iran. This study aimed to the epidemiological and histological trend of bladder cancer in Iran. In this study , data were extracted from annual cancer registry reports of Iranian Ministry of Health between 2003 and 2008. Standardized incidence rates were calculated using the world standard population and incidence rate was calculated by age groups , sex , and histological type. Data on epidemiologic trend and histology were analyzed using Joinpoint software package. A total of 23,291 cases were reported. Almost 17.70 % ( 4127 cases) were women and 82.30 % ( 19,170 cases) men. The sex ratio ( male to female) was 4.65. Joinpoint analysis showed the significant increased trend of age-standardized incidence rate ( ASIR) for both sexes. The annual percentage change of standardized incidence rate was 11.5 ( confidence interval ( CI): 9.0-14.0) in women and 10.8 ( CI: 8.0-13.6) in men. Two histological types of transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC) , not otherwise specified and papillary TCC included 43.89 % and 49.86 % of all cancer cases , respectively. According to this study the trend of ASIR of bladder cancer in Iran is rising , so it is necessary to conduct further researches in future to provide accurate information on the cancer and investigate related risk factors and implement prevention programs in Iran.
