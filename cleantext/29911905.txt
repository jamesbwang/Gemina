  To determine upper incisor root resorption , volume loss , and the relationship between root volume loss and tooth movement after 1 year of orthodontic treatment in patients with marginal bone loss. A total of 30 women ( 46.3 ± 5.4 years old) with moderate upper incisor bone loss who required intrusion during orthodontic treatment were recruited. Pre- and post-treatment cone beam computed tomography images were reconstructed. Upper<symptom> incisors at pre- and post-treatment were superimposed; labio- and palato-apical , middle , and coronal third root volumes were assessed. Tooth movement and alveolar bone height were measured from lateral cephalometric radiographs and cone beam computed tomography. Changes in root volume/alveolar bone height were compared using paired-sample t-tests , percentage root volume loss for each tooth/segment was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance , and the relationship between percentage root loss and degree of tooth movement was assessed by linear regression. Mean root volume significantly decreased on the labio- and palato-apical aspects of 12 and labio-apical aspects of 21 and 22 ( P ≤ .024). Palato-apical segment volume loss was greater on lateral than central incisors ( P ≤ .016). Two-dimensional root length and cementoenamel junction-bone crest distance did not change between T0 and T1 , with no significant relationship between tooth movement amount and percentage root volume loss. Delivery of 40 g intrusive force to the four upper incisors using a T-loop and the leveling phase lead to more apical root volume loss on lateral than central incisors. There was no relationship between extent of tooth movement and upper incisor root volume loss.
