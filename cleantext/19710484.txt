  High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T ( hsTnT) was recently approved for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration. The transition from contemporary to hsTnT assays requires a thorough understanding of the clinical differences between these assays. HsTnT may provide a more accurate prognostic stratification than contemporary cardiac troponin I ( cTnI) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes<disease> ( NSTE-ACS). HsTnT and cTnI were measured in 644 patients with CK-MB negative NSTE-ACS who were enrolled in the prospective multicenter SPAI ( Stratificazione Prognostica dell ` Angina Instabile) study. Patients were stratified at the 99th percentile reference limit for each assay. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular death ( CVD) or non-fatal myocardial infarction ( MI); the secondary endpoint was the occurrence of unstable angina ( UA). Follow-up lasted 180 days. Patients with hsTnT â‰¥ 99th percentile were at higher risk of CVD/MI ( 30-day: 5.9 % vs 0.8 % , Our investigation on a real-world NSTE-ACS population showed good prognostic performance of hsTnT in the risk stratification of the hard endpoint , but did not demonstrate the improved prognostic ability of hsTnT over contemporary cTn. Neither troponin assay predicted the recurrence of UA , suggesting the acute rise of cardiac troponin as a marker of severity , but not the occurrence of future coronary instability.
