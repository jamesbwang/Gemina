  Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder. With proper treatment and self-care , persons with hemophilia can maintain an active , productive lifestyle. Hemophilia can be mild , moderate , or severe , depending on the degree of plasma clotting factor deficiency. The aim of the study was to assess the utility of ISTH-BAT in diagnosis , determining severity of the bleeding condition in newly diagnosed and known hemophilia patients , compare the bleeding score ( BS) in adult and pediatric groups and investigate its association with plasma factor levels. ISTH-BAT was used to assess BS in a total of 115 patients , 78 with hemophilia A , and 37 with hemophilia B and in 100 controls. BS was significantly higher in HA and HB patients as compared to controls , with no significant difference between HA and HB. The BS was very similar in newly diagnosed compared to known hemophilia patients , lower in pediatric compared to adult and higher in severe compared to mild HA patients. The ISTH BAT can help identify hemophilia patients. Therefore it is a useful tool to distinguish between affected and unaffected individuals with bleeding. Moreover , an important finding of our study is that there is no major difference between the scores in known and newly diagnosed patients.
