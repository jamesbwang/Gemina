  As obligate intracellular parasites , virus reproduction requires host cell functions. Despite variations in genome size and configuration , nucleic acid composition , and their repertoire of encoded functions , all viruses remain unconditionally dependent on the protein synthesis machinery resident within their cellular hosts to translate viral messenger RNAs ( mRNAs). A complex signaling network responsive to physiological stress , including infection , regulates host translation factors and ribosome availability. Furthermore , access to the translation apparatus is patrolled by powerful host immune defenses programmed to restrict viral invaders. Here , we review the tactics and mechanisms used by viruses to appropriate control over host ribosomes , subvert host defenses , and dominate the infected cell translational landscape. These not only define aspects of infection biology paramount for virus reproduction , but continue to drive fundamental discoveries into how cellular protein synthesis is controlled in health and disease.
