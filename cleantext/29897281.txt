  AKI ( Acute Kidney Injury) occurs frequently in hospitals worldwide , the therapeutic options are limited. Diabetes mellitus ( DM) affects more and more people around the globe , the disease worsens the prognosis of AKI even further. In recent years , cell-based therapies have increasingly been applied in experimental AKI. Aim of the study was to utilize two established autophagy inducers for pharmacological preconditioning of so-called proangiogenic cells ( PACs) in PAC treatment of diabetic AKI. Insulin-dependent DM was induced in male C57/Bl6N mice by i.p. injections of streptozotocine. Six weeks later , animals underwent bilateral renal ischemia for 45 minutes , followed by i.v. injections of either native or zVAD ( benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoro-methylketone)- or MG132 ( Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al)- pretreated syngeneic murine PACs. Mice were analyzed 48 hours ( short-term) and 6 weeks ( long-term) later , respectively. DM worsened post-ischemic AKI and PAC preconditioning with zVAD and MG132 resulted in a further decline of excretory kidney function. Injection of native PACs reduced fibrosis<disease> in non-diabetic mice but cell preconditioning promoted interstitial matrix accumulation significantly. Both substances aggravated EndoMT ( Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition) under diabetic conditions , these effects occurred either exclusively in the short- ( zVAD) or in the short- and long-term ( MG132). Preconditioned cells stimulated the autophagocytic flux in intrarenal endothelial cells and all experimental groups displayed increased endothelial abundances of SA-b-Gal ( Senescence associated beta-Galactosidase) , a marker of premature cell senescence. Pharmacological autophagy activation may most likely not serve as effective strategy for improving PAC competence in diabetic AKI in general. On the contrary , several outcome parameters ( excretory function , fibrosis<disease> , EndoMT) may even be worsened.
