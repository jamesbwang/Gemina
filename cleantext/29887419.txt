  O-linked Î²-N-acetyl glucosamine modification ( O-GlcNAcylation) is a dynamic , reversible posttranslational modification of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. O-GlcNAcylation depends on nutrient availability and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway ( HBP) , which produces the donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc. O-GlcNAcylation is mediated by a single enzyme , O-GlcNAc transferase ( OGT) , which adds GlcNAc and another enzyme , O-GlcNAcase ( OGA) , which removes O-GlcNAc from proteins. O-GlcNAcylation controls vital cellular processes including transcription , translation , the cell cycle , metabolism , and cellular stress. Aberrant O-GlcNAcylation has been implicated in various pathologies including Alzheimer 's disease , diabetes , obesity , and cancer. Growing evidences indicate that O-GlcNAcylation plays crucial roles in regulating immunity and inflammatory responses , especially under hyperglycemic conditions. This review will highlight the emerging functions of O-GlcNAcylation in mammalian immunity under physiological and various pathological conditions.
