  The thyroid hormones act through their nuclear receptor TRs that are T3-modulated transcription factors. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms at the basis of specific physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> to TH-TR , in vitro approaches are commonly used to demonstrate the activation or repression of target genes. These approaches allow identifying direct transcriptional targets of TRs which can eventually be confirmed by using in vivo chromatin binding assays.Here , we describe two classical approaches in vitro and in cell lines such as Electro-Mobility Shift Assay and thyroid-hormone-responsive Luciferase-reporter assay ( EMSA and Luc , respectively) we have been largely using to investigate TRÎ±1-driven TH-TRs intestinal epithelium cell autonomous action.
