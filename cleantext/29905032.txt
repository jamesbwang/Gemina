  Eukaryotic chromatin structure and dynamics play key roles in genomic regulation. In the current study , the secondary structure and intramolecular dynamics of human histone H4 ( hH4) in the nucleosome core particle ( NCP) and in a nucleosome array are determined by solid-state NMR ( SSNMR). Secondary structure elements are successfully localized in the hH4 in the NCP precipitated with Mg
