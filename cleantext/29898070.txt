  The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cyclic<symptom> fatigue<symptom> of two anatomic finishing files: XP-Endo Finisher and XP-Clean. Roughness pattern and the micro-hardness of the files were also assessed. Instruments were subjected to cyclic<symptom> fatigue<symptom> resistance measuring the time to fracture in an artificial stainless-steel canal with a 60 Â° angle and a 5-mm radius of curvature. The fracture surface of all fragments was examined with a scanning electron microscope. The roughness of the working parts was quantified by using a profilometer and the micro-hardness test was carried out using a Vickers hardness tester. Results were statistically analyzed using a student 's t-test at a significance level of P < 0.05. Weibull analysis was also performed. XP-Endo Finisher presented significantly longer cyclic<symptom> fatigue<symptom> life than XP-Clean instruments ( P < 0.05). XP-Endo Finisher was able to withstand 1000 % more cycles to fracture when compared to XP-Clean instruments. SEM visual inspection of the fracture surfaces revealed fractographic characteristics of ductile fracture in all tested instruments; wide-ranging forms of dimples were identified and no plastic deformation in the helical shaft of the fractured instruments was observed. When mean life was compared XP-Endo Finisher lasted longer than XP-Clean with a probability of 99.9 %. XP-Endo Finisher instruments also exhibited significantly lower roughness than XP-Clean instruments ( P < 0.05). No differences in the micro-hardness was observed between the files ( P > 0.05). It can be concluded that XP-Endo Finisher instruments showed improved performance when compared with XP-Clean instruments , demonstrating higher cyclic<symptom> fatigue<symptom> resistance and lower roughness.
