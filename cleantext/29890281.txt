  Evidence from clinical studies suggests that patients with low testosterone levels are at increased cardiovascular disease risk. Even though the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood , low plasma testosterone is associated with a pro-atherogenic lipid profile , insulin resistance and increased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators , and vascular dysfunction which is typically observed in patients with hypogonadism. Furthermore , recent evidence suggests that testosterone deficiency has also direct adverse effects on endothelium and nitric oxide bioavailability. Observations from studies in patients with hypogonadal hypogonadism imply that the mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction related with testosterone-deficiency may involve changes in asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA) levels , a known endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. Evidence suggests that testosterone replacement therapy is not only a safe , but also an effective means to reduce atherosclerotic risk and reverse endothelial dysfunction in patients with hypogonadal hypogonadism. Further research in the field is expected to clarify whether changes in ADMA metabolism constitute the central mechanism via which low testosterone leads to endothelial dysfunction.
