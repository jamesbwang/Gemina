  In modern swine husbandry systems , antibiotics have been used as growth promoters for piglets during suckling or weaning period. However , while early colonization of intestinal microbiota has been regarded crucial for the host 's later life performance and well-being , little is known about the impact of antibiotics on intestinal microbiota in suckling piglets. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of early antibiotics exposure on gut microbiota and microbial metabolism of suckling piglets. Sixteen litters of suckling piglets were fed a creep feed diet with ( Antibiotic) or without ( Control) antibiotics from postnatal days 7-23 (
