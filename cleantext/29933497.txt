  One of the hallmarks of ventral midbrain dopamine-releasing neurons is membrane hyperpolarization in response to stimulation of somato-dendritic D We performed single-unit extracellular recordings with a multi-electrode array device and conventional patch-clamp recordings on midbrain mouse slices. While continuous dopamine ( 100 Î¼M) perfusion gave rise to firing inhibition that recovered in 10 to 15 min , the same effect was not obtained with the D Our results indicate that the DAT plays a major role in DIR , mediating it under conditions of sustained dopamine exposure , and point to DAT as an important target for pharmacological therapies leading to prolonged enhancement of the dopaminergic signal.
