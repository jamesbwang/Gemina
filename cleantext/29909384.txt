  Common femoral artery aneurysms<disease> are rare , and surgical repair is indicated if they are significantly large , or if they are symptomatic ( thrombosis causing limb ischaemia and compression of surrounding structures). Synthetic grafts are preferred , especially in cases involving large aneurysms<disease> , or the bifurcation of the common femoral artery. We present a case of bilateral common femoral artery aneurysms<disease> extending into the bifurcation repaired using a synthetic graft which is traditionally used for an axillobifemoral bypass. This technique was employed due to the specific anatomical relationship between the profunda<disease> femoris and the superficial femoral artery in our patient. We will also review the current literature on the operative approaches to repair of common femoral artery
