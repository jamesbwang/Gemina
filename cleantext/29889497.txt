  To accurately monitor the variations of lysosomal nitric oxide ( NO) under physiological condition remains a great challenge for understanding the biological function of NO. Herein , we developed a new chemotype probe , namely , MBTD , for acid-promoted and far-red fluorescence imaging of lysosomal NO in vitro and ex vivo. MBTD was rationally designed by incorporating o-phenylenediamino ( OPD) moiety into the donor-acceptor-donor ( D-A-D) type fluorophore based on a dual intramolecular charge transfer ( ICT) mechanism. Compared to previously reported OPD-based NO probes , MBTD displays several distinct advantages including large stroke shift , huge on-off ratio with minimal autofluorescence , and high NO specificity. Particularly , MBTD exhibits an acid-promoted response to NO with high acid tolerance , which greatly improves the spatial resolution to lysosomal NO by excluding the background noise from other nonacidic organelles. Furthermore , MBTD displayed much longer-lived and more stable fluorescence emission in comparison with the commercialized NO probe. MBTD was employed for ratiometric examination of the exogenous or endogenous NO of macrophages. More importantly , MBTD was able to detect the variation of lysosomal NO level in an acute liver injury mouse model ex vivo , implying the potential of MBTD for real-time monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of drug candidates for the treatment of acute liver injury. MBTD as a novel type of NO probe might open a new avenue for precisely sensing lysosomal NO-related pathological and therapeutic process.
