  To observe the effect of electroacupuncture ( EA) preconditioning on acute myocardial ischemia ( MI) and expression of Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR 4) , myeloid differentiation factor 88 ( MyD 88) and nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB) mRNAs in the `` Neiguan '' ( PC 6) area of rats with MI-reperfusion injury ( MIRI) , so as to explore its mechanisms underlying improvement of MIRI. Forty-eight male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control , control ＋ EA , sham operation , model , EA and sham EA groups ( Compared with the control group , the height of ECG J-point was significantly increased in the model group ( EA preconditioning can improve myocardial ischemia and reduce the expression of TLR 4 , MyD 88 and NF-κB mRNAs in PC 6 area of MIRI rats , suggesting an involvement of the regional cutaneous TLR 4/MyD 88/NF-κB signaling suppression in the initiation-transfer-amplification of EA stimulating signal inputs for relieving MIRI.
