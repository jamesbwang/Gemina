  Although photons have been repeatedly shown to affect the functioning of the nervous system , their effects on neurotransmitter release have never been investigated. We exploited in vitro models that allow effects involving neuron-astrocyte network functioning to be detected ( mouse cerebrocortical slices) and dissected these effects at cerebrocortical nerve endings and astrocyte processes. Infrared light proved able to induce glutamate release by stimulating glutamatergic nerve endings. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
