  The transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4 ( TRPM4) channel influences calcium homeostasis during many physiological activities such as insulin secretion , immune response , respiratory reaction , and cerebral vasoconstriction. This calcium-activated , monovalent , selective cation channel also plays a key role in cardiovascular pathophysiology; for example , a mutation in the TRPM4 channel leads to cardiac conduction disease. Recently , it has been suggested that the TRPM4 channel is also involved in the development of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury , which causes myocardial infarction. In the present review , we discuss the physiological function of the TRPM4 channel , and assess its role in cardiovascular pathophysiology.
