  The profile of essential and non-essential elements was traced in the edible sea hares Aplysia depilans Gmelin , Aplysia fasciata Poiret and Aplysia punctata Cuvier. Manganese ( Mn) , iron ( Fe) , zinc ( Zn) , copper ( Cu) and selenium ( Se) were identified as the major essential elements. Risk assessment evidenced that the levels of cadmium ( Cd) and lead ( Pb) did not exceed the maximum limit value established by the European Regulation , the contents of chromium ( Cr) , nickel ( Ni) and arsenic ( As) being also below the levels established by the FDA guide. A correlation between trace elements levels and desaturation-elongation indexes of fatty acids was found. While Cd , Se and molybdenum ( Mo) seem to promote the desaturation-elongation process involved on the production of C20: 4n-6c , Ni , Cr and Fe may potentiate the conversion of C18: 3n-3c to C20: 5n-3c. Furthermore , cobalt ( Co) , Ni and Cu appear to decrease Î”9 desaturation index. Besides the suggested biosynthetic switch modulated by trace elements , the nutritional value of the species is further strengthened.
