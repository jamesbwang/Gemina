  S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent 2 '- O-methylati-on of the 3 '- terminal nucleotide plays important roles in biogenesis of eukaryotic small non-coding RNAs , such as siRNAs , miRNAs and Piwi-interacting RNAs ( piRNAs). Here we demonstrate that , in contrast to Mg2 +/ Mn2 +- dependent plant and bacterial homologues , the Drosophila DmHen1 and human HsHEN1 piRNA methyltransferases require cobalt cations for their enzymatic activity in vitro. We also show for the first time the capacity of the animal Hen1 to catalyse the transfer of a variety of extended chemical groups from synthetic analogues of the AdoMet cofactor onto a wide range ( 22-80 nt) of single-stranded RNAs permitting their 3 '- terminal functionalization and labelling. Moreover , we provide evidence that deletion of a small C-terminal region of the DmHen1 protein further increases its modification efficiency and abolishes a modest 3 '- terminal nucleotide bias observed for the full-length protein. Finally , we show that fluorophore-tagged ssRNA molecules are successfully detected in fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays both individually and in a total RNA mixture. The presented DmHen1-assisted RNA labelling provides a solid basis for developing novel chemo-enzymatic approaches for in vitro studies and in vivo monitoring of single-stranded RNA pools.
