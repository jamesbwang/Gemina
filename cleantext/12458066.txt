  To reduce the risk of patient damage and complications during the cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR) process in emergency situations , it is necessary to monitor the status of the patient and the quality of CPR while CPR processing without additional bio-signal measurement devices. In this study , an algorithm is proposed to estimate the mechanical impedance ( MI) between an actuator of the CPR machine and the chest of the patient , and to estimate the power delivered to the chest of the patient during the CPR process. Two sensors for force and depth measurement were embedded into a custom-made CPR machine and the algorithm for MI and power estimation was implemented. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by comparing the results from the kinetic model , the conventional discrete Fourier transform ( DFT) , and the proposed method. The estimations of the proposed method showed similar increasing/decreasing trends with the calculations from the kinetic model. In addition , the proposed method showed statistically equivalent performance in the MI estimation , and at the same time , showed statistically superior performance in the power estimation compared with the calculations from the conventional DFT. Furthermore , the MI and power estimation could be performed almost in real-time during the CPR process without excessive hands-off periods , and the intensity of random noise contained in the input signals did not seriously affect the MI and power estimations of the proposed method. We expect that the proposed algorithm can reduce various CPR-related complications and improve patient safety.
