  A vast range of insulating , semiconducting , and metallic nanomaterials have been studied over the past several decades with the aim of understanding how continuous-wave or pulsed laser radiation can influence their chemical functionality and local environment. Many fascinating observations have been made during laser irradiation including , but not limited to , the superheating of solvents , mass-transport-mediated morphology evolution , photodynamic therapy , morphology dependent resonances , and a range of phase transformations. In addition to laser heating , recent experiments have demonstrated the laser cooling of nanoscale materials through the emission of upconverted , anti-Stokes photons by trivalent rare-earth ions. This focus review outlines the analytical modeling of photothermal heat transport with an emphasis on the experimental validation of anti-Stokes laser cooling. This general methodology can be applied to a wide range of photothermal applications , including nanomedicine , photocatalysis , and the synthesis of new materials. The review concludes with an overview of recent advances and future directions for anti-Stokes cooling.
