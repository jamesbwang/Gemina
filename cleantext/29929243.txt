  Climate change and socioeconomic factors have increased the complexity of urban water supply systems. Thus , fresh water sources are being gradually diversified to improve the reliability and resilience of the systems. However , as the number of source blending options grows , optimization tools are needed to design drinking water supply systems that comply with indicators of cost , resilience , and water quality. This paper proposes a pioneering methodological approach , based on an ant-colony-optimization ( ACO) algorithm , to optimize the blending of drinking water from different sources to minimize operational costs of a given system originating from a number of impaired water sources while complying with water quality standards. To evidence the potential of the ACO algorithm to solve such a system , a virtual case study was designed that considers eight fresh water sources , including seawater desalination and potable reuse. Seven scenarios were developed with different weightings to service outage , water conveyance and treatment costs while complying with water quality goals in regard to total organic carbon , nitrates , and total dissolved solids. It was shown that the cost per volumetric unit of water can vary considerably depending on the weightings of the three cost items. This paper provides a rigorous scientific approach to propose a methodology supporting the decision-making process of selecting a mixture of different sources to achieve the overall lowest system cost. Hence , this work contributes to improving the resilience and sustainability of urban water supplies.
