  In this paper , the research related to the formation of optical dissipative structures in Kerr-nonlinear whispering-gallery mode resonators pumped with continuous-wave lasers is reviewed. Pattern formation in these systems can be analysed using the paradigmatic Lugiato-Lefever model , which is a partial differential equation ruling the dynamics of the intra-cavity laser field. Various dissipative structures such as Turing rolls , solitons , breathers and spatio-temporal chaos can emerge in the resonator depending on the laser power and frequency. The bifurcation analysis enables a classification of these patterns , and also permits identification of their basins of attraction.This article is part of the theme issue ` Dissipative structures in matter out of equilibrium: from chemistry , photonics and biology ( part 1) '.
