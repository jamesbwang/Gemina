  Accurate modeling of human neuronal cell biology has been a long-standing challenge. However , methods to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs) to neurons have recently provided experimentally tractable cell models. Numerous methods that use small molecules to direct iPSCs into neuronal lineages have arisen in recent years. Unfortunately , these methods entail numerous challenges , including poor efficiency , variable cell type heterogeneity , and lengthy , expensive differentiation procedures. We recently developed a new method to generate stable transgenic lines of human iPSCs with doxycycline-inducible transcription factors at safe-harbor loci. Using a simple two-step protocol , these lines can be inducibly differentiated into either cortical ( i
