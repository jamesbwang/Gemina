  Considering the crucial role of biothiols in many biological processes , which turns them into highly valuable biomarkers for the early diagnosis of various diseases , the development of an affordable , sensitive and portable probe for the identification and discrimination of these compounds is of great importance. Herein , we developed a ratiometric fluorescent ( RF) sensor array with a wide color emissive variation , on a bacterial cellulose ( BC) nanopaper substrate for the visual discrimination of biothiols. To this aim , RF sensing elements including N-acetyl l-cysteine capped green CdTe quantum dots-rhodamine B ( GQDs-RhB) and red CdTe QDs-carbon dots ( RQDs-CDs) at two different NaOH concentrations ( 0 and 5 mM) were utilized as sensor elements for the discrimination of biothiols. Owing to the high affinity of the thiol group ( SH) to the surface of CdTe QDs and the aggregation of the QDs , the fluorescence ( FL) emission of the QDs changed while the emission of the CDs and rhodamine B remained almost unchanged upon the addition of biothiols. Accordingly , characteristic rainbow-like FL fingerprint patterns were created for each biothiol which were then distinguished both visually and spectroscopically. Hierarchical cluster analysis ( HCA) and linear discriminant analysis ( LDA) pattern recognition techniques were employed for the identification and discrimination of biothiols. Based on the designed RF sensor array , convenient test strips were fabricated on BC nanopaper for the visual discrimination of biothiols. It has been shown that this probe can successfully identify biothiols in human plasma as well. Altogether , the developed nanopaper-based sensor array offers an efficient biothiol discrimination tool that can be potentially exploited in the near future in theranostic and point-of-care applications.
