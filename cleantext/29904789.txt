  Visual working memory contents can be selectively weighted according to differences in their task-relevance. In the present study , we examined the influence of two more indirect selection biases established by a concurrent task or learned reward associations: action relevance and motivational value. In three experiments , memory performance was assessed with the same color<symptom> change<symptom> detection task. Potential action relevance and motivational value were each determined by a specific feature of the memory items ( location or shape , respectively) and manipulated orthogonally. Investigated separately ( Experiments 1A and 1B) , both selection biases modulated visual working memory. In combination ( Experiment 2) , action relevance and motivational value still each exerted an influence , but not in a fully independent and additive manner. While action relevance impacted performance irrespective of the reward associated with the items , an effect of motivational value was only observed for action-relevant items. These results support the notion that visual working memory is automatically biased as an inherent part of action planning. More generally , these findings highlight the versatile nature of visual working memory: Contents can be flexibly weighted to reflect differences in their importance , taking into account several sources of information.
