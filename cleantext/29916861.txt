  Intraoperative hypotension<symptom> is associated with postoperative mortality. Early detection of hypotension<symptom> by continuous hemodynamic monitoring might prompt timely therapy , thereby reducing intraoperative hypotension<symptom>. We tested the hypothesis that continuous noninvasive blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> monitoring reduces intraoperative hypotension<symptom>. Patients â‰¥ 45 years old with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status III or IV having moderate-to-high-risk noncardiac surgery with general anesthesia were included. All participating patients had continuous noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring using a finger cuff ( ClearSight , Edwards Lifesciences , Irvine , CA) and a standard oscillometric cuff. In half the patients , randomly assigned , clinicians were blinded to the continuous values , whereas the others ( unblinded) had access to continuous blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> readings. Continuous pressures in both groups were used for analysis. Time-weighted average for mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg was compared using 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Hodges Lehmann estimation of location shift with corresponding asymptotic 95 % CI. Among 320 randomized patients , 316 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. With 158 patients in each group , those assigned to continuous blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> monitoring had significantly lower time-weighted average mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg , 0.05 ( 0.00 , 0.22) mm Hg , versus intermittent blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> monitoring , 0.11 ( 0.00 , 0.54) mm Hg ( P = .039 , significance criteria P < .048). Continuous noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring nearly halved the amount of intraoperative hypotension<symptom>. Hypotension<symptom> reduction with continuous monitoring , while statistically significant , is currently of uncertain clinical importance.
