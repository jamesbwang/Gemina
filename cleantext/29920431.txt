  Previous research has established that child sexual abuse ( CSA) and other forms of child maltreatment can have lasting and profound implications for survivors in terms of externalizing symptomatology. Few studies , however , have examined long-term consequences of CSA and maltreatment among adopted children. Guided by a polyvictimization framework , the present study investigated: ( a) rates of co-occurrence of pre-adoptive CSA and maltreatment among adopted children , and ( b) the relative impact of pre-adoptive CSA and maltreatment on externalizing behaviors at 14 years post-adoption. Analyses were based on four waves of data from the California Long-Range Adoption Study ( CLAS) ( n = 522); outcomes were measured using an adapted version of the Behavioral Problems Index ( BPI). The diverse sample ( 36 % non-White) was evenly divided by gender ( 50 % female/male) and included a large number of children adopted from foster care ( 42.1 %). Results indicated that 24.3 % ( n = 127) of children experienced at least one form of maltreatment; of those children , nearly half ( 46.5 %; n = 59) experienced multiple abuse types ( e.g. , neglect , sexual , physical). Among cases of CSA ( 7.7 %; n = 40) , the vast majority ( 92.5 %; n = 37) occurred with other forms of maltreatment. Hierarchical linear mixed models indicated that pre-adoptive CSA was associated with nearly a full unit increase in BPI scores ( .92; p < .01). Neglect was associated with nearly a half unit increase in BPI ( .48; p < .05). Gender was also significant; girls had lower BPI scores than boys ( -0.57; p < .001). Implications for future research and practice are discussed.
