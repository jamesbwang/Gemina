  The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of biostimulation lasers and ozone therapy on osseointegration of immediately loaded implants. A total number of 100 implants ( DTI Implant Systems) were applied to 25 patients evenly. Temporary crowns were applied to each patient on the same session as the surgery. Implants were divided into four treatment groups ( Group 1: low-level laser therapy ( LLLT) group , Group 2: ozone therapy group , Group 3: different protocol of ozone therapy group , and Group 4: control group) each with 25 implants. The irradiations were performed with a gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode low-level laser ( Laser BTL-4000) to Group 1. Ozone therapy was performed using an ozone generator ( OzoneDTA) with an intraoral probe to Group 2 and Group 3. In this study , the overall implant survival rate was 92 % after a 6-month observation period. The implant stability quotient values were found significantly higher in Group 1 ( LLLT group) and Group 3 ( different protocol of ozone therapy group) than the other groups ( P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in Group 2 ( ozone therapy group) and the control group ( P > 0.05). Our results suggest that both LLLT and ozone therapy with prolonged application time are promising methods to enhance bone healing around immediately loaded implants and increase implant stability; however , there is a need for more studies on this subject for these methods to become routine applications.
