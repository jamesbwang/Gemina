  Crown architecture usually is heterogeneous as a result of foraging in spatially and temporally heterogeneous light environments. Ecologists are only beginning to identify the importance of temporal heterogeneity for light acquisition in plants , especially at the diurnal scale. Crown architectural heterogeneity often leads to a diurnal variation in light interception. However , maximizing light interception during midday may not be an optimal strategy in environments with excess light. Instead , long-lived plants are expected to show crown architectures and leaf positions that meet the contrasting needs of light interception and avoidance of excess light on a diurnal basis. We expected a midday depression<symptom> in the diurnal course of light interception both at the whole-crown and leaf scales , as a strategy to avoid the interception of excessive irradiance. We tested this hypothesis in a population of guava trees (
