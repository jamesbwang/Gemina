  To evaluate whether a teleconference-based lecture provides similar understanding of seizure<symptom> semiology to a face-to-face lecture for physicians. Subjects were 66 physicians consisting of adult and pediatric neurologists , neurosurgeons , psychiatrists , and general practitioners. All attended the 30-minute lecture to introduce various types of seizure<symptom> semiology using video-clips by one of the authors ( Yo.K.) and then joined the comprehensive case conference which discussed three cases in 1.5 h. Group A received the lecture and conference using a teleconference system ( N = 43) and Group B attended in person ( N = 23) for geographical reasons. After the conference , 32 subjects ( 23 in Group A and nine in Group B) scored their own post-lecture understanding of seizure<symptom> semiology using the four-point Likert scale from 1 ( not at all) to 4 ( very well) as well as the estimated pre-lecture score. Data was analyzed to assess whether their understanding was improved after the lecture. No significant difference was found in improvement of understanding after the lecture between Group A ( 43 %) and Group B ( 22 %; p = 0.42). Pre-lecture score of subjects with improved understanding was significantly lower ( 2.3 +/- 0.2) than those without improvement ( 3.7 +/- 0.1) ( p < 0.05). Teleconference-based lectures can be a useful tool to educate seizure<symptom> semiology for physicians , especially at the inexperienced level , by overcoming geographical limitations.
