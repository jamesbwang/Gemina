  Both plants and animals must contend with changes in their environment. The ability to respond appropriately to these changes often underlies the ability of the individual to survive. In plants , an early response to environmental stress is an alteration in plasmodesmatal permeability with accompanying changes in cell to cell signaling. However , the ways in which plasmodesmata are modified , the molecular players involved in this regulation , and the biological significance of these responses are not well understood. Here , we examine the effects of nutrient scarcity and excess on plasmodesmata-mediated transport in the Arabidopsis thaliana root and identify two CALLOSE SYNTHASES and two Î²-1,3-GLUCANASES as key regulators of these processes. Our results suggest that modification of plasmodesmata-mediated signaling underlies the ability of the plant to maintain root growth and properly partition nutrients when grown under conditions of excess nutrients.
