  To examine the spectrum of scleritis in four tertiary institutions across the Asia-Pacific. Clinical records from 354 patients were reviewed from centers in Australia , Singapore , and India , excluding those with insufficient data ( n = 24). Indian patients presented younger ( 41.5 ± 13.4 years) than Australians ( 50.8 ± 17.5) and Singaporeans ( 48.6 ± 15.9) , with fewer women ( 49 % vs 62 %/ 57 %). Diffuse disease was universally most common. Autoimmune and infectious<disease> disease<disease> proportions were similar in Australia ( 31 %/ 10.3 %) and Singapore ( 27.5 %/ 8.3 %) but reversed in India ( 8.3 %/ 30 %). Necrotizing scleritis was most frequently associated with infection ( 27.3 %). Presumed ocular tuberculosis<disease> accounted for 75 % of infectious cases in India. Posterior scleritis had the highest complication rate ( 82.4 %) and immunosuppressants used per patient ( 0.98 ± 0.31 95 % CI). Clinical presentations of scleritis vary across the Asia-Pacific , particularly in endemic regions for tuberculosis<disease> such as India , where it affects younger men with a predominance of nodular and
