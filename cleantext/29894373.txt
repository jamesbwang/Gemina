  The Supportive Care Nursing Clinical Protocol ( SCNCP) was developed to guide holistic nursing care for seriously ill hospitalized patients. The SCNCP uses national guidelines and evidence-based interventions as its foundation. Seriously ill patients may require palliative care , which is synonymous with supportive care. Acute care nurses may not be proficient in providing holistic supportive care for patients with life-limiting illness. At a 670-bed public acute care hospital , palliative care consultation requires a physician order and palliation may arrive late in an illness. Independent nursing interventions can contribute to the alleviation of suffering. Evidence-based interventions used in the SCNCP include using computer applications for breathing exercise ( relaxation and mindfulness) , topical applications for alleviating thirst , and hand-held fans for dyspnea<symptom>. The SCNCP is projected for implementation ( Spring 2017). The SCNCP will be evaluated for effectiveness after 6 months of implementation. Key indicators for successful implementation include increased nursing knowledge of supportive care and the frequency of protocol implementation as evidenced in the electronic health record. Eventually , the SCNCP will be implemented as the standard for supportive care of the seriously ill for all hospitals in the health system network.
