  This study proposes different markers associations for the discrimination of organically and conventionally grown carrots , as well as for the geographical origin differentiation. It was shown that one of the most powerful differentiation markers proved to be Mn content. Along with manganese concentrations , isotope ratios of nitrogen and a high number of Rare Earth-Elements ( REEs) were able to differentiate the organically grown carrots samples in a percent of 83.3 % ( initial classification) and 81 % ( cross-validation) , respectively. It was observed that some of the obtained discrimination markers were interlinked , for instance Mn content being positively correlated with some REEs ( i.e. Sc , La , Ce , Pr , Nd , Lu , Th). One of the best markers that could differentiate the carrot samples grown in Transylvania , Romania , from those either grown in other side of the country or foreign samples is represented by Mn content along with another REE , particularly terbium ( Tb).
