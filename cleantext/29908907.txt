  Apoptotic cell receptors contribute to the induction of tolerance by modulating dendritic cell function following the uptake of apoptotic cells or microparticles. Dendritic cells that have bound or ingested apoptotic cells produce only low amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and fail to prime effector T cell responses. Specifically , ligation of the apoptotic cell receptor CR3 ( CD11 b/CD18) on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells ( moDC) down-modates proinflammatory cytokine secretion , but the consequences for human Th17 cell homeostasis and effector responses remain unknown. Here , we aimed to establish whether CD11b-ligated moDC modulate Th17 cell effector reponses to assess their potential for future use in moDC-based suppressive immunotherapy. We generated a bead-based surrogate system to target CD11b on monocyte-derived human dendritic cells and examined the effects of CD11b ligation on Th17-skewing cytokine secretion , priming , expansion and functional plasticity in DC/T cell co-culture systems at the poly- and monoclonal level. We show that Th17 cell expansion within the human memory CD4 Overall , our findings underline the potential of targeted CD11b ligation on human dendritic cells for the engineering of suppressive immunotherapy for Th17-related autoimmune disorders.
