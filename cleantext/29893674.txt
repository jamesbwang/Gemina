  The use of the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system and red cell distribution width ( RDW) as post-op Atrial<symptom> Fibrillation<symptom> ( POAF) predictors may be promising for the identification of patients that are at a higher risk of POAF. A total of 358 patients ( 57 patients with POAF , and 301 patients with non-POAF) with sinus rhythm undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG) operation were included in the study retrospectively. Preoperative RDW levels and electrocardiograms with sinus rhythm were recorded. Patients with at least one 12-lead electrocardiogram with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> in the postoperative period , with or without medical or electrical cardioversion , were considered to have postoperative atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. A CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc score was calculated for all of the patients. RDW levels were significantly higher in POAF group. RDW levels were significantly correlated with CHADS2 ( r = 0.15 , P = .007) and CHA2DS2-VASc ( r = 0.19 P = .0001) scores. CHA2DS2-VASc scores were significantly higher in patients with POAF , whereas CHADS2 scores did not differ between groups. In multivariate analysis , left atrial diameter ( LAD) ( OR: 2.44 ( 95 % CI 1.16- 5.1) , P = .018) , age ( OR: 1.04 ( 95 % CI 1.01- 1.08) , P = .01) , and RDW ( OR: 1.16 ( 95 % CI 1.0- 1.36) , P = .05) were found to be predictive for POAF. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of RDW was 0.65 ( 0.57- 0.72 , P = .0001) with 68.4 % sensitivity and 51.2 % specificity to predict POAF. Our study showed that age , LAD , and the reduced probability of RDW are predictors of POAF , and that RDW is strongly associated with the thromboembolic risk as determined by CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores.
