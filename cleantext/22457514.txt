  We have long known that rod and cone signals interact within the retina and can even contribute to color<symptom> vision<symptom> , but the extent of these influences has remained unclear. New results with more powerful methods of RNA expression profiling , specific cell labeling , and single-cell recording have provided greater clarity and are showing that rod and cone signals can mix at virtually every level of signal processing. These interactions influence the integration of retinal signals and make an important contribution to visual perception.
