  Several studies have suggested that neurotensin receptors ( NTRs) and neurotensin ( NT) greatly affect the growth and survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC). Developing NTR-targeted PET probes could therefore be important for the management of a pancreatic cancer patient by providing key information on the NTR expression profile noninvasively. Despite the initial success on the synthesis of
