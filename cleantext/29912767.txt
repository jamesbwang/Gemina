  Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) amplification is one of the common alterations in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. It is frequently associated with EGFRvIII mutation. To evaluate the correlation between EGFR overexpression , gene amplification , and EGFRvIII mutation , we performed immunohistochemical ( IHC) analysis , fluorescence in situ hybridization by Vysis LSI EGFR/CEP7 dual color probe , and polymerase chain reaction studies in 76 patients diagnosed with glioblastomas ( 67 IDH-wildtype and 9 IDH-mutant). EGFR expression was scored ranging from 0 to 3 +. Using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections , real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was carried out with primers specific for EGFRvIII and EGFR wildtype. In addition , we evaluated the impact of EGFR status on prognosis. EGFR gene amplifications and EGFRvIII mutations were identified in 30.3 % and 15.5 % of all cases , respectively. All the EGFR-amplified or EGFRvIII mutant cases were IDH-wildtype glioblastomas and tested positive with IHC. The sensitivity and specificity of EGFR IHC predicting EGFR gene amplification status were 100.0 % and 46.5 % , respectively. The EGFR-amplified cases tended to show more intense immunostaining ( 3 +) in a considerable number of tumor cells ( â‰¥ 50 %). Survival analyses of 37 IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients revealed that none of the EGFR alterations significantly affected prognosis. EGFR IHC displayed high sensitivity and low specificity in predicting EGFR gene amplification , and interpretation of IHC results is a challenge. Therefore , EGFR IHC represents a possible screening tool for evaluation of EGFR gene amplification in clinical neuropathology , and both the intensity and proportion score facilitate interpretation of EGFR IHC.
