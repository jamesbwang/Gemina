  Experimental evolution is a critical tool in many disciplines , including metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. However , current methods rely on the chance occurrence of a key step that can dramatically accelerate evolution in natural systems , namely increased gene dosage. Our studies sought to induce the targeted amplification of chromosomal segments to facilitate rapid evolution. Since increased gene dosage confers novel phenotypes and genetic redundancy , we developed a method , Evolution by Amplification and Synthetic Biology ( EASy) , to create tandem arrays of chromosomal regions.
