  A 45-year woman , carrying an IUD for 2 years , was referred to our emergency unit for pelvic pain and bleeding. At vaginal examination , the strings of the IUD were not identified. Laboratory parameters were unremarkable. The abdominal radiography documented the presence of IUD in the abdominal cavity ( FIG. 1). During laparoscopy , the surgeon was unable to localize the IUD and an intraoperative ultrasound examination was requested. Using a sterile transabdominal probe the presence of a tubular hyperechoic structure in the abdominal cavity was confirmed and a precise localization within the bowel loops was defined ( FIG 2 and Video 1).
