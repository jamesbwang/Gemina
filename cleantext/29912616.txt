  The potential mechanism of miRNA released from adipose-derived stem cell ( ADSC)- derived micro vesicle ( MV) onthe modulation of proliferation , migration and invasion of endothelial cells were explored. In this study , miR-210 level was detected by qT-PCR. Alix , VEGF and RUNX3 expressions were detected by Western blot. The proliferation , migration and invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) were observed by MTT assay and Transwell assay. Luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to validate the targeting activity of MVs-released miR-210 on RUNX3. We found hypoxia significantly increased the expression of MVs-released miR-210. MVs released from ADSCsin hypoxic group significantly promoted the proliferation , migration and invasion of HUVECs. Overexpression of miR-210 significantly upregulated VEGF expression , and promoted the proliferation , migration and invasion of HUVECs. Besides , RUNX3 was identified as the direct of miR-210 in HUVECs. Overexpression of miR-210 decreased RUNX3 expression and promoted the proliferation , migration and invasion of HUVECs , while overexpression of RUNX3 inhibited these promotion effects. In vivo experiment showed that MVs derived from ADSCs under hypoxia increased miR-210 level and capillary density , and inhibition of miR-210 decreased capillary density. We also found MVs downregulated RUNX3 expression , and inhibition of miR-210 upregulated RUNX3 expression. Therefore , miR-210 released from ADSCs-derived MVs promoted proliferation , migration and invasion of HUVECs by targeting RUNX3 , which revealed one of the mechanisms of ADSCs-derived MVs on the promotion of proliferation , migration and invasion of HUVECs.
