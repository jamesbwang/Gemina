  We performed a prospective study to quantify changes in various aspects of upright posture<symptom> intolerance in patients with intracranial hypotension<symptom>. Six patients were provided a standard questionnaire before , immediately after epidural blood patch injection and at follow-up visit within 1 month after epidural blood<symptom> injection<symptom> inquiring: ( a) How long can they stand straight without any support? ( b) Do they feel any sense of sickness when they sit or lie down after standing? ( c) How long do they have to wait before they are comfortable standing again after they have stood straight? ( d) How effectively and fast can they get up from sitting or lying position to stand straight? and ( e) Rate their activities in upright posture<symptom> without support on a standard vertical visual analogue scale between 100 ( can do everything) and 0 ( can not do anything). All patients responded that they could not stand straight for ≥ 30 min ( four responding < 5 min) on pretreatment evaluation. All patients reported improvement in this measure immediately postprocedure with two reporting ≥ 30 min. At follow-up , three patients reported further improvement and one patient reported worsening in this measure. The magnitude of improvement ranged from 10 to 80 points increase immediately postprocedure in their ability to perform activities , while they are standing without any support on visual analogue scale. At follow-up , four patient reported additional improvement in their ability to perform activities , while they are standing without any support ( ranged from 10 to 20 points increase compared with immediately postprocedure rating). We present semiquantitative data on various aspects of upright posture<symptom> intolerance in patients with intracranial hypotension<symptom> before and after epidural
