  Drought stress is one of the most important abiotic stresses. Cotton is classified as drought tolerant crop but the regulatory mechanism is unknown. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) have been implicated important roles in stress responses in many plants. However , the study of miRNAs in cotton responsive to drought stress is limited , especially in early-maturing cotton. In this study , we performed deep sequencing of small RNAs to identify known and novel miRNAs involved in the regulation of drought stress and understand the expression profile of miRNAs in early-maturing cotton. Three cotton small RNA libraries: non-stressed Shizao1 ( early-maturing cotton variety) library ( NSS) , drought-stressed Shizao1 library ( DSS) and non-stressed Jimian958 ( medium-maturing cotton variety) library ( NSJ) were constructed for deep sequencing. As a result , we identified a total of 64 known and 67 novel miRNAs in the 3 libraries and 88 of them were dramatically differentially expressed ( greater than twofold) during drought stress. In addition , we found the expression of 41 miRNAs increased or reduced more than twofold in early-maturing cotton variety compared with that in medium-maturing cotton variety. Our results significantly increased the number of miRNAs in cotton and revealed for the first time the expression profile of miRNAs for early-maturing cotton.
