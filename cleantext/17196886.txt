  This work was designed to investigate biological impacts at 3 dates ( day 0 , day 7 and day 21) on black scallops ( Mimachlamys varia) in the three ports areas of La Rochelle town in winter 2017. In order to assess the biological effects on the wild population of black scallops , bivalves were place in four different locations: in the three ports ( semi-closed areas) , and in a marshland uncontaminated site ( closed area). Biomarkers of effects ( heavy metals) and exposure ( oxidative stress and immunological effects) were assessed in the digestive glands of specimens in order to compare two techniques of sampling: `` pool '' technique and `` inter-subject '' technique. Our findings reported in the both techniques show significant modulation of GST ( detoxification) , SOD ( antioxidant response) and MDA ( lipid peroxidation) in bivalves exposed to a specific contamination in each port. Laccase-type enzyme also highlighted an important aspect in terms of biomarker response of the immune function at the 7th day of exposition. Overall , our study demonstrated that the `` pool '' technique using the same quality indicator M. varia could be used to obtain reliable results at lower costs. In contrast , in fundamental context , the `` inter-subject '' technique could bring more precise results to light. However , it requires burdensome and costly handling.
