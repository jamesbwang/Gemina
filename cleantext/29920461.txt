  Biogeochemical hotspots are pervasive at terrestrial-aquatic interfaces , particularly within groundwater-surface water mixing zones ( hyporheic zones) , and they are critical to understanding spatiotemporal variation in biogeochemical cycling. Here , we use multi ` omic comparisons of hotspots to low-activity sediments to gain mechanistic insight into hyporheic zone organic matter processing. We hypothesized that microbiome structure and function , as described by metagenomics and metaproteomics , would distinguish hotspots from low-activity sediments by shifting metabolism towards carbohydrate-utilizing pathways and elucidate discrete mechanisms governing organic matter processing in each location. We also expected these differences to be reflected in the metabolome , whereby hotspot carbon ( C) pools and metabolite transformations therein would be enriched in sugar-associated compounds. In contrast to expectations , we found pronounced phenotypic plasticity in the hyporheic zone microbiome that was denoted by similar microbiome structure , functional potential , and expression across sediments with dissimilar metabolic rates. Instead , diverse nitrogenous metabolites and biochemical transformations characterized hotspots. Metabolomes also corresponded more strongly to aerobic metabolism than bulk C or N content only ( explaining 67 % vs. 42 % and 37 % of variation respectively) , and bulk C and N did not improve statistical models based on metabolome composition alone. These results point to organic nitrogen as a significant regulatory factor influencing hyporheic zone organic matter processing. Based on our findings , we propose incorporating knowledge of metabolic pathways associated with different chemical fractions of C pools into ecosystem models will enhance prediction accuracy.
