  Australian efforts to address food insecurity are delivered by a charitable food system ( CFS) which fails to meet demand. The scope and nature of the CFS is unknown. This study audits the organisational capacity of the CFS within the 10.9 square kilometres of inner-city Perth , Western Australia. A desktop analysis of services and 12 face-to-face interviews with representatives from CFS organisations was conducted. All CFS organisations were not-for ‚Åª profit and guided by humanitarian or faith-based values. The CFS comprised three indirect services ( IS) sourcing , banking and/or distributing food to 15 direct services ( DS) providing food to recipients. DS offered 30 different food services at 34 locations feeding over 5670 people/week via 16 models including mobile and seated meals , food parcels , supermarket vouchers , and food pantries. Volunteer to paid staff ratios were 33:1 ( DS) and 19:1 ( IS). System-wide , food was mainly donated and most funding was philanthropic. Only three organisations received government funds. No organisation had a nutrition policy. The organisational capacity of the CFS was precarious due to unreliable , insufficient and inappropriate financial , human and food resources and structures. System-wide reforms are needed to ensure adequate and appropriate food relief for Australians experiencing food insecurity.
