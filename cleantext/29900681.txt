  The growing incidence of brain-related pathologies and the problems that undermine the development of efficient and effective treatments have prompted both researchers and the pharmaceutical industry to search for novel therapeutic alternatives. Polymer therapeutics ( PT) display properties well suited to the treatment of neuro-related disorders , which help to overcome the many hidden obstacles on the journey to the central nervous system ( CNS). The inherent features of PT , derived from drug ( s) conjugation , in parallel with the progress in synthesis and analytical methods , the increasing knowledge in molecular basis of diseases , and collected clinical data through the last four decades , have driven the translation from `` bench to bedside '' for various biomedical applications. However , since the approval of Gliadel Â® wafers , little progress has been made in the CNS field , even though brain targeting represents an ever-growing challenge. A thorough assessment of the steps required for successful brain delivery via different administration routes and the consideration of the disease-specific hallmarks are essential to progress in the field. Within this review , we hope to summarize the latest developments , successes , and failures and discuss considerations on designs and strategies for PT in the treatment of CNS disorders.
