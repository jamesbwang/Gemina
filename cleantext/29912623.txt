  Saxagliptin as one of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4) inhibitors can effectively improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus , and nesfatin-1 is regarded as a very important factor in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. In this trial , we observed the effect of saxagliptin on regulating nesfatin-1 secretion and ameliorating insulin resistance and metabolic profiles in type 2 diabetes mellitus. One hundred two type 2 diabetes participants ( M/F = 48/54) were investigated. Fifty-one ( M/F = 24/27) of them as the treatment group were treated with oral glucose-lowering agents including saxagliptin , the other 51 ( M/F = 24/27) as the control group were treated with oral glucose-lowering agents excluding any DPP-4 inhibitors. The parameters of serum nesfatin-1 , C-peptide , homeostasis model assessment-β ( HOMA-β) function , HOMA insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR) , glycosylated hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) , body mass index ( BMI) , and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) at baseline , month 3 , 6 , and 12 were observed and compared respectively. Saxagliptin significantly upregulated nesfatin-1 secretion ( P < 0.001 at 3- , 6- , and 12-months vs. baseline) , increased serum C-peptide ( P < 0.05 , 0.001 , and 0.001 at 3- , 6- , and 12-months vs. baseline) , improved HOMA-IR and function of HOMA-β ( P < 0.001 at 3- , 6- , and 12-months vs. baseline) and metabolic profiles ( P < 0.001 with HbA1c at 3- , 6- and 12-months; P < 0.001 with LDL-C at 6- and 12-months; P < 0.001 and 0.01 with HDL-C at 6- and 12-months vs. baseline) , declined BMI ( P < 0.05 at 6- and 12-months vs. baseline) and BP ( P < 0.001 with systolic BP ( SBP) , and mean BP at 6- and 12-months , P < 0.01 with diastolic BP at 6- and 12-months vs. baseline). Saxagliptin could upregulate nesfatin-1 secretion and ameliorate insulin resistance and metabolic profiles in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Saxagliptin had the potential to play fundamental by upregulating nesfatin-1 secretion besides lowering glucose by inhibiting the degradation of glucagon-like peptide-1.
