  Over expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) in many human epithelial tumors has been correlated with disease progression and poor prognosis. EGFR-inhibiting immunotherapy has already been introduced in cancer therapy. Peptide displaying phage particles in eukaryotic hosts can behave as antigen carriers , able to activate the innate immune system and to elicit adaptive immunity. Herein , the M13-pAK8-VIII phagemid plasmid was engineered to contain the sequences for an EGFR mimotope along with the L2 extracellular domain of EGFR ( EM-L2) which would produce the final peptide-phage vaccine. The prophylactic and therapeutic effects of this novel vaccine were evaluated on the Lewis lung carcinoma induced mouse ( C57/BL6) model. The recombinant peptide was confirmed to be displayed on the surface of M13 phage as an extension for phage 's PVIII protein. Immunization of mice with peptide-phage vaccine resulted in antibody production against EM-L2 and significant reduction of tumor growth rate by nearly 25 percent. In conclusion , EM-L2 displaying phage particles could be deemed as an encouraging strategy in contemporary cancer immunotherapy.
