  A 12-year-old boy in an asylum-seeking family suffered from extreme regression. A few days after a minor traffic accident , he regressed to the developmental stage of a young toddler. The rare diagnosis pervasive refusal syndrome<disease> ( prs) was made. This is considered to be an extreme form of a conversion disorder. We provided multidisciplinary , supportive and stimulating treatment , taking into account potentially influential factors. The boy recovered slowly , resuming adequate functionality two years later. Additional reports of similar cases are necessary to improve the knowledge on prs.
