  Goal-directed hemostatic resuscitation based on thrombelastography has a survival benefit compared to conventional coagulation assays. While thrombelastography transfusion thresholds for patients at risk for massive transfusion ( MT) have been defined , similar cutoffs do not exist for the other commonly used viscoelastic assay , rotational thromboelastometry ( ROTEM). The purpose of this study was to develop ROTEM blood product thresholds in patients at risk for MT. ROTEM was assessed in trauma activation patients admitted from 2010 to 2016 ( n = 222). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to test the predictive performance of ROTEM measurements in patients requiring MT. The Youden Index defined optimal thresholds for ROTEM-based resuscitation. Patients who required MT ( n = 37 , 17 %) were more severely injured. EXTEM clotting time ( CT) was longer in patients with MT compared to non-MT ( 87 versus 64 s , P < 0.0001). EXTEM angle was shallower in MT patients compared to non-MT ( 54 째 versus 69 째 , P < 0.0001). Clot amplitude after 10 min ( CA10) was less in MT compared to non-MT patients ( 30.5 versus 50 mm , P < 0.0001). Clot lysis index 60 min ( CLI60) was lower in patients who had MT than non-MT ( 47 versus 94 % , P = 0.0006). EXTEM CT yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUROC) = 0.7116 and a cut point of > 78.5 s. EXTEM angle had an AUROC = 0.865 and a cut point of < 64.5 째. EXTEM CA10 had an AUROC = 0.858 , with a cut point of < 40.5 mm. CLI60 had an AUROC = 0.6788 with a cut point at < 74 %. We have identified ROTEM thresholds for transfusion of blood components in severely injured patients requiring an MT. Based on our analysis , we propose plasma transfusion for EXTEM CT > 78.5 s , fibrinogen for angle < 64.5 째 , platelet transfusion for CA10 < 40.5 mm , and antifibrinolytics for CLI60 < 74 %.
