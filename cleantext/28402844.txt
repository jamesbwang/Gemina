  In this study , tetradecanol/graphene aerogel form-stable composite phase change materials were prepared by physical absorption. Two kinds of graphene aerogels were prepared using vitamin C and ethylenediamine to enhance the thermal conductivity of tetradecanol and prevent its leakage during phase transition. The form-stable composite phase change material exhibited excellent thermal energy storage capacity. The latent heat of the tetradecanol/graphene aerogel composite phase change materials with 5 wt. % graphene aerogel was similar to the theoretical latent heat of pure tetradecanol. The thermal conductivity of the tetradecanol/graphene aerogel composite phase change material improved gradually as the graphene aerogel content increased. The prepared tetradecanol/graphene aerogel composite phase change materials exhibited good thermal reliability and thermal stability , and no chemical reaction occurred between tetradecanol and the graphene aerogel. In addition , the latent heat and thermal conductivity of the tetradecanol/ethylenediamine-graphene aerogel composites were higher than those of tetradecanol/vitamin C-graphene aerogel composites , and the flexible shape of the ethylenediamine-graphene aerogel is suitable for application of the tetradecanol/ethylenediamine-graphene aerogel composite.
