  Accumulation of heavy metals results in soil degradation and impairs the normal functioning of ecosystems. Thus , monitoring of heavy metals is essential in both pristine and polluted soils. Concentrations of heavy metals were determined in a pristine tropical agricultural soil using acid digestion procedures. The soil samples were also analyzed for physico-chemical parameters and biochar toxicity to earthworms. Data shows that the soil is acidic , with low organic matter content. The level of heavy metals ranged from < 0.06 ± 0.0 to 595.8 ± 2.8 µg g
