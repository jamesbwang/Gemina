  Hepatic artery thrombosis ( HAT) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after orthotopic liver transplantation , occurring in 5 % of cases ( Piardi et al , 2016). HAT is the second main cause of graft loss after primary nonfunction , the leading cause of graft failure in the immediate postoperative period ( < 1 month) , and is associated with a mortality rate of up to 60 % without intervention ( Piardi et al , 2016; Pareja et al. , 2010; Crossin et al. , 2003). Although retransplantation is the preferred therapy , the limited availability of donor organs can necessitate urgent , alternative treatment. These patients present physicians with an often-severe clinical picture , which requires consideration of endovascular approaches as opposed to the more traditional , invasive surgical interventions. The following case study presents a novel mechanical therapy that uses an endovascular approach for revascularization-a stent retriever device.
