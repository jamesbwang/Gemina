  Lateral femoral prosthesis perforation is an uncommon periprosthetic fracture. Periprosthetic fractures may be fixed with open reduction and internal fixation , or with revision arthroplasty , depending on the type of fracture , the condition of the host bone in the proximal femur , the stability of the implant , and occasionally the medical co-morbidities of the patient. Proximal femoral replacement is a complex and challenging procedure but provides a better chance of early mobilisation. We describe a case of treating a 71-year-old woman who presented with an unusual type of periprosthetic fracture , treated with a revision arthroplasty procedure using a proximal femur replacement.
