  The formation of complex dendritic arbors is crucial for the assembly of functional networks as abnormal dendrite formation underlies several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Many extracellular factors have been postulated as regulators of dendritic growth. Wnt proteins play a critical role in neuronal development and circuit formation. We previously demonstrated that Wnt7b acts through the scaffold protein dishevelled 1 ( Dvl1) to modulate dendrite arborisation by activating a non-canonical Wnt signalling pathway. Here , we identify the seven-transmembrane frizzled-7 ( Fz7 , also known as FZD7) as the receptor for Wnt7b-mediated dendrite growth and complexity. Importantly , Fz7 is developmentally regulated in the intact hippocampus , and is localised along neurites and at dendritic growth cones , suggesting a role in dendrite formation and maturation. Fz7 loss-of-function studies demonstrated that Wnt7b requires Fz7 to promote dendritic arborisation. Moreover ,
