  Studies analyzing risk factors of weaning failure in neurological and neurosurgical early rehabilitation ( NNER) patients are rare. The aim of this study was to identify clinical factors influencing the weaning of NNER patients. An observational , retrospective data analysis of a German multi-center study was performed. Inpatient ventilated NNER patients ( n = 192) were enrolled in the study. Demographical data , main diagnosis , medical devices , special medical care and assessment instruments of functional abilities , consciousness<symptom> and independence in activities of daily living were accrued and compared between patients with and without successful weaning. The prognostic power of factors associated with weaning success/failure was analyzed using binary logistic regression. In total , 75 % of the patients were successfully weaned. Colonization with multi-drug resistant bacteria and the need for dialysis were independent predictors of weaning failure. Successfully weaned patients had a shorter length of stay , better functional outcome , and lower mortality than non-successfully weaned patients. Successfully weaned patients differ from patients with weaning failure in several clinical variables. All these variables are associated with the morbidity of the patient , indicating that the weaning process is strongly influenced by disease burden. Functional abilities , level of consciousness<symptom> , independence in activities of daily living , colonization with multi-drug resistant bacteria , need for dialysis and disease duration might help to predict the weaning process of NNFR.
