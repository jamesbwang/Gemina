  Until recently , the mainstay of treatment in the majority of hormone receptor ( HR)- positive , human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor ( HER2)- negative advanced breast cancer ( ABC) has consisted of single-agent endocrine therapy ( ET). However , as understanding of endocrine resistance has grown , newer targeted agents have come to the fore. Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase complexes 4 and 6 ( CDK4/6) combined with ET has shown significant activity in HR + HER2- ABC , with impressive results in terms of progression-free survival ( PFS) when compared with ET alone. This review summarizes the seminal findings pertaining to CDK4/6 inhibition in this population , specifically focusing on abemaciclib , contrasted with palbociclib and ribociclib. Potential directions for future studies are discussed , as a way of addressing outstanding issues such as establishing optimal treatment sequencing and agent combinations , appropriate patient selection to derive maximal benefits , predictive biomarkers and the employment of CDK4/6 inhibition beyond the ABC setting.
