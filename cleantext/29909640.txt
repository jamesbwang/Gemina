  The reverse camber shoe is commonly used after hallux valgus corrective surgery to offload the forefoot but is associated with back pain and poor compliance. Recent designs of postoperative shoes may obviate the need for a reverse camber. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a reverse camber shoe and a noncambered shoe with transitional rigidity after hallux valgus correction. A cohort of 80 feet was prospectively studied undergoing surgery at a single NHS trust. The first 40 feet received the reverse cambered Jura Medical Off-loader Heel shoe and the subsequent 40 feet received the noncambered DonJoy Podalux shoe. No demographic differences existed between the groups and data were collected at 2 weeks , 6 weeks , and 6 months. The Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire ( MOXFQ) , a 5-question survey and dichotomous question about back pain was used to assess clinical outcome and radiographs were reviewed by 2 orthopaedic surgeons to monitor for loss of correction. Both groups experienced comparable improvements in MOXFQ and shoe satisfaction from 2 weeks compared with 6 weeks. Six patients experienced back pain in the reverse cambered shoe group and none in the noncambered shoe group. Five patients stopped using the reverse cambered shoe during the first 6 weeks after surgery and none stopped using their prescribed noncambered shoe. No loss of corrections were observed in either group. Both shoe designs gave equal foot specific functional and radiological outcomes , but the noncambered shoe with transitional rigidity was associated with less back pain and better compliance. Level II: Prospective comparative study.
