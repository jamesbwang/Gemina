  Chinese giant salamander ( CGS) has high medicinal value and long history of clinical use in ancient China. In this study , CGS skin ( CGSS) collagen was extracted and purified to prepare collagen sponge by freeze-drying. TEMPO oxidized microfibrillated cellulose ( TEMPO-MFC) and genipin were adopted to improve the mechanical properties of collagen sponge. The hygroscopicity , porosity , mechanical properties , hemostatic performance , morphology , and biodegradability of the resultant sponges were investigated in detail. The results indicated that CGSS collagen was type I collagen with intact triple-helical structure , and the prepared sponge had porous structure and excellent hemostatic performance with procoagulant ratio of 53.28 %. However , the CGSS collagen sponge showed low tensile strength ( TS) of 98.80 KPa , compression strength ( CS) of 1.48 KPa , and elongation at break ( E) of 4.72 %. Incorporating 2.5 % TEMPO-MFC into the native CGSS collagen sponge resulted in an increase of 188.26 % in TS to 284.80 KPa , 166.89 % in CS to 3.95 KPa , and 73.52 % in E to 8.19 %. The improvements were attributed to the physical filling of TEMPO-MFC in cavity and cavity wall of collagen sponge and the stable chemical linkage between carboxyl of TEMPO-MFC and amino group of collagen which effectively improved the toughening of sponge and formed good interface bonding , respectively. Subsequent 0.3 % genipin treatment further improved the TS to 605.00 KPa and the CS to 8.66 KPa as a result of crosslinking reaction. Moreover , the composite reinforcing also improved the anti-degradation ability and procoagulant ratio of collagen sponge. All results suggested that the TEMPO-MFC toughened and genipin crosslinked CGSS composite collagen sponge is a promising rapid hemostatic material with high-strength and can be applicated in biomedical field.
