  To evaluate the effect of psychosis on prognosis as measured by the course of a manic episode , symptoms severity and time to remission and identify existing differences in positive and negative symptoms between psychotic and non-psychotic patients. 40 bipolar patients presenting with a diagnosis of acute mania were enrolled ( 18 psychotic patients and 22 non psychotic patients) in this cross-sectional study. Subjects were required to complete two self-reported questionnaires , the Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS) for manic symptoms , and Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale ( PANSS) for psychotic symptoms. Rating scales were administered at baseline and then again after three weeks of pharmacologic treatment. There were no difference in socio-demographic characteristics between psychotic and non-psychotic subjects. Psychosis was associated with higher scores on the YMRS and PANSS ( increased symptoms severity) , compared to non-psychotic patients. Both groups demonstrated clinical improvement and remission , with scores amongst psychotic patients remaining higher. Groups were similar in symptomatology except with regards to psychotic symptoms ( the content , insight , delusions , hallucinations , grandiosity , poor rapport , unusual thoughts). Psychosis can be considered a severity index in bipolar disorder , with decreased severity and overall clinical improvement and remission taking place in response to pharmacotherapy.
