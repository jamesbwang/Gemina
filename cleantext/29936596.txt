  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) is currently the world 's most common liver disease , estimated to affect up to one-fourth of the population. Hallmarked by hepatic steatosis , NAFLD is associated with a multitude of detrimental effects and increased mortality. This narrative review investigates the molecular mechanisms of hepatic steatosis in NAFLD , focusing on the four major pathways contributing to lipid homeostasis in the liver. Hepatic steatosis is a consequence of lipid acquisition exceeding lipid disposal , i.e. , the uptake of fatty acids and de novo lipogenesis surpassing fatty acid oxidation and export. In NAFLD , hepatic uptake and de novo lipogenesis are increased , while a compensatory enhancement of fatty acid oxidation is insufficient in normalizing lipid levels and may even promote cellular damage and disease progression by inducing oxidative stress , especially with compromised mitochondrial function and increased oxidation in peroxisomes and cytochromes. While lipid export initially increases , it plateaus and may even decrease with disease progression , sustaining the accumulation of lipids. Fueled by lipo-apoptosis , hepatic steatosis leads to systemic metabolic disarray that adversely affects multiple organs , placing abnormal lipid metabolism associated with NAFLD in close relation to many of the current life-style-related diseases.
