  To investigate whether heat-induced fiber degradation and loss of power output , which occurred during GreenLight laser vaporization ( LV) of the prostate using the first- and second-generation 80 and 120 W laser , are still an issue during LV using the upgraded third generation 180 W GreenLight XPS ™ laser. Laser beam power output of 53 laser fibers was measured at baseline and after every 25 kJ of delivered energy during routine 180 W GreenLight XPS ™ LV in 47 patients with prostatic bladder outflow obstruction. After the procedures , the fiber tips were microscopically examined. The median applied energy per patient was 178 kJ ( interquartile range ( IQR): 106-247). Loss of power output during the procedure was detectable in all fibers. After the application of 25 , 150 , and 250 kJ , the median power output decreased to 77 % ( IQR 59-87) , 57 % ( IQR 32-71) , and 51 % ( IQR 37-64) of the baseline value. Nine fibers ( 17 %) remained on a relatively high power output level ( > 80 % of the initial output) , while 13 fibers ( 25 %) showed an end-of-procedure power output of less than 20 %. Microscopy of the fiber tip revealed mild-to-moderate overall degradation and increasing degradation with higher energy delivered. Despite changes in fiber design , heat-induced fiber damage and loss of power output remain an issue during 180 W GreenLight XPS ™ LV. Whether modifications of the surgical technique can prevent impairment of fiber performance needs to be further evaluated.
