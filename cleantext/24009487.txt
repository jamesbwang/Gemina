  This study explores the perceived barriers to primary health care as identified among a sample of Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender , and Queer ( LGBTQ) identified individuals and health care providers in Nova Scotia , Canada. These findings , based on a province-wide anonymous online survey , suggest that additional efforts are needed to improve pathways to primary health among LGBTQ populations and in deepening our understanding of how to advance the unique primary health needs of these populations. Data were collected from the LGBTQ community through an online , closed-ended anonymous survey. Inclusion criteria for participation were self-identifying as LGBTQ , offering primary health care to LGBTQ patients , being able to understand English , being 16 years of age or older , and having lived in Nova Scotia for at least one year. A total of 283 LGBTQ respondents completed the online survey which included sociodemographic questions , perceptions of respondents ' health status , and their primary health care experiences. In addition , a total of 109 health care providers completed the survey based on their experiences providing care in Nova Scotia , and in particular , their experiences and perceptions regarding LGBTQ access to primary health care and physician-patient interactions. Our results indicate that , in several key areas , the primary health care needs of LGBTQ populations in Nova Scotia are not being met and this may in turn contribute to their poor health outcomes across the life course. A framework of intersectionality and health equity was used to interpret and analyze the survey data. The key findings indicate the need to continue improving pathways to primary health care among LGBTQ populations , specifically in relation to additional training and related supports for health care providers who work with these populations.
