  The use of idiofonic ethnical istruments known as `` Tibetan Singing Bowls '' , characterized by a fascinating sound<symptom> and a deep vibration , have been for millennials part of a culture including music , rythuals , theory of Chakra and oriental Ayurvedical medicine. The practice of utilization of the Bowls is related to Sound Therapy rather than to Music Therapy , since the therapeutic effects appears to be a consequence of the vibrations of the Bowls , and not from their music. Besides , the lack of a therapeutic relationship ( terapist/patient) makes not possible to include this kind of treatment in the field of Music Therapy. Therapeutic use of the Bowls has been especially focused in the treatment of `` pain ''. Up to know , not enough research has been developed in this field.
