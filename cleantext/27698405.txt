  Geminiviruses are major plant pathogens that threaten food security globally. They have a unique architecture built from two incomplete icosahedral particles , fused to form a geminate capsid. However , despite their importance to agricultural economies and fundamental biological interest , the details of how this is realized in 3D remain unknown. Here we report the structure of Ageratum yellow vein virus at 3.3 Ã… resolution , using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy , together with an atomic model that shows that the N-terminus of the single capsid protein ( CP) adopts three different conformations essential for building the interface between geminate halves. Our map also contains density for ~ 7 bases of single-stranded DNA bound to each CP , and we show that the interactions between the genome and CPs are different at the interface than in the rest of the capsid. With additional mutagenesis data , this suggests a central role for DNA binding-induced conformational change in directing the assembly of geminate capsids.
