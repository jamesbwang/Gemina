  Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( Cdk1) is indispensable for embryonic stem cell ( ESC) maintenance and embryo development. Even though some reports have described a connection between Cdk1 and Oct4 , there is no evidence that Cdk1 activity is directly linked to the ESC pluripotency transcription program. We recently reported that Aurkb/PP1-mediated Oct4 resetting is important to cell cycle maintenance and pluripotency in mouse ESCs ( mESCs). In this study , we show that Cdk1 is an upstream regulator of the Oct4 phosphorylation state during cell cycle progression , and it coordinates the chromatin associated state of Oct4 for pluripotency-related gene expression within the cell cycle. Upon entry into mitosis , Aurkb in the chromosome passenger complex becomes fully activated and PP1 activity is inhibited downstream of Cdk1 activation , leading to sustaining Oct4 ( S229) phosphorylation and dissociation of Oct4 from chromatin during the mitotic phase. Cdk1 inhibition at the mitotic phase abnormally results in Oct4 dephosphorylation , chromosome decondensation and chromatin association of Oct4 , even in replicated chromosome. Our study results suggest a molecular mechanism by which Cdk1 directly links the cell cycle to the pluripotency transcription program in mESCs.
