  Discrimination is associated with worse health. Although interventions have been developed to improve coping with general stressors and chronic illness , no literature to date has reported the development and testing of an intervention specifically to address coping with discrimination. We examined the feasibility , acceptability , and preliminary effects of Still Climbin ' , a pilot intervention created to improve coping with discrimination experienced by HIV-positive Black sexual minority men , who face significant HIV-related disparities. Still Climbin ' was culturally tailored using community stakeholder input and formative qualitative research. Still Climbin ' consists of 8 weekly group sessions and a graduation session , based on principles of cognitive behavior therapy. Sixty-four HIV-positive Black sexual minority men were recruited from community venues; 38 were randomized to the intervention and 26 to a wait-list control group. Participants completed assessments at baseline and 3- and 6-months postbaseline. Intervention participants completed postsession feedback forms. Repeated-measures regressions indicated significant intervention effects on improved coping in response to discrimination , including functional ( problem-solving) coping ( b ( SE) = 0.39 ( 0.19) , p = .04) , humor ( b ( SE) = 0.48 ( 0.22) , p = .03) , and cognitive/emotional debriefing ( b ( SE) = 0.30 ( 0.14) , p = .04) , a culturally relevant form of coping that includes self-protective strategies ( e.g. , strategic avoidance of certain places or people). Intervention participants rated the sessions positively in response to closed- and open-ended questions. Still Climbin ' was feasible and acceptable to participants , and showed promise for improving coping with discrimination , which ultimately can lead to better health outcomes and reduced disparities.
