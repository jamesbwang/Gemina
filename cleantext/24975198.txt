  To characterize the seasonal variation , over one year , in water-quality , antibiotic residue levels , antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotic resistance in Water and sediment samples were collected from seven selected points from the Kshipra River in the Indian city of Ujjain in the summer , rainy season , autumn and winter seasons in 2014. Water quality parameters ( physical , chemical and microbiological) were analyzed using standard methods. High-performance liquid chromatography ‚Åª tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine the concentrations of antibiotic residues. In river water and sediment samples , antibiotic resistance and multidrug resistance patterns of isolated In river water , seasonal variation was significantly associated with various water quality parameters , presence of sulfamethoxazole residues , bacteria resistant to ampicillin , cefepime , meropenem , amikacin , gentamicin , tigecycline , multidrug resistance and CTX-M-1 gene. The majority of the Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase ( ESBL)- producing Antibiotic pollution , resistance and resistance genes in the Kshipra River showed significant seasonal variation. Guidelines and regulatory standards are needed to control environmental dissemination of these & ldquo; pollutants & rdquo; in this holy river.
