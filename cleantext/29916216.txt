  We present a fiber-optic dual-confocal laser caliper method for noncontact high-precision sensing and measuring thickness and refractive index of intraocular lens ( IOL) implants. The principle of the method is based on sensing and measuring the confocal intensity response of the laser beam reflection from the opposite object surfaces , which provides the advanced feature of having no limitations on the object shape , thickness , and transparency. Using single-mode optical fibers and a 658-nm laser source , the thickness measurement accuracy was assessed to be as high as 5 Î¼m. In addition , refractive index of a transparent object with thickness smaller than the working distance of the focusing lenses can be measured. The thickness and refractive index of a planoconvex IOL were measured with a high accuracy.
