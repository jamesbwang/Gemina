  High-grade B-cell lymphomas with MYC , BCL2 , and/or BCL6 rearrangements , `` double hit '' or `` triple hit '' lymphomas ( DTHL) , are aggressive neoplasms associated with a poor prognosis. A t ( 3; 8) ( q27; q24) rarely occurs in B-cell lymphomas that results in a unique `` pseudo-double hit '' BCL6-MYC fusion , indistinguishable by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) from more conventional DTHL with independent MYC and BCL6 translocations. Reports of t ( 3; 8) ( q27; q24) lymphomas are sparse , and to better characterize their pathologic , cytogenetic , and clinical features , 6 new cases from 2 institutions and 19 previously published cases were reviewed. All new cases displayed aggressive morphologic features , and most previously published cases were classified as aggressive lymphomas. Collectively , all t ( 3; 8) ( q27; q24) cases had a germinal center ( GC) phenotype and most had complex karyotypes ( 22/24 , 92 %) , including frequent concomitant BCL2 rearrangements ( 17/24 , 71 %). When compared to two large published DTHL cohorts , t ( 3; 8) ( q27; q24) lymphomas less often expressed BCL2 ( p < .01) , had a greater likelihood of extranodal involvement ( p < .01) , and more frequently appeared triple hit by FISH analysis ( p < .01). Despite presenting with aggressive clinicopathologic features , 100 % ( 6/6) of t ( 3; 8 ;-RRB- ( q27; q24) patients achieved complete remission after intensive induction regimens , and 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 63 % ( 10/16) and 57 % ( 8/14) , respectively. These findings suggest that lymphomas with t ( 3; 8) ( q27; q24) may represent a subset of GC B-cell lymphomas distinct from conventional DTHL. Our results further highlight the value of routine karyotype assessment in aggressive B-cell lymphomas , and the importance of recognizing the t ( 3; 8) ( q27; q24) so that its clinical significance can be more fully explored.
