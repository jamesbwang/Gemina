  Repair of large soft tissue defects in meningomyelocele is difficult and its morbidity is high. By applying unilateral lumbar artery perforator transposition flap for closing these defects , we aimed to investigate effects on the repair procedure , duration of surgery and recovery period , with the rates of bleeding and morbidity. Our report was conducted in 38 patients between the years 2013 and 2017. All soft tissue defects were repaired with unilateral lumbar artery perforator flap ( LAPF) in meningomyelocele. Fourteen patients were female and 24 patients were male. The youngest patient was a 5.5 month premature female baby and weighing 570 g. The oldest was weighing 3,700 g and at 1.5 months old. Mean flap size was 32 Â± 29.4 cm As a result , unilateral lumbar perforator flap can be performed successfully in every center. This report suggests using LAPF for reconstruction of meningomyelocele by surgeons as a safe and reliable option , allowing surgeons strong results.
