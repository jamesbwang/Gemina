  Poor<symptom> clinical responses to checkpoint blockade with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies in melanoma have recently been associated with acquired IFNγ resistance that protects tumor cells from the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic cytokine activity. IFNγ-resistant melanoma cells very often lack functional expression of the IFNγ signaling pathway gene JAK2 due to gene deletions or inactivating gene mutations. Analyzing melanoma cell lines ( n = 46 , applying next-generation targeted sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays) as well as available genomic data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA) tumor tissue samples ( cutaneous melanoma n = 367 , lung squamous cell carcinoma n = 501 , bladder urothelial carcinoma n = 408 , breast invasive carcinoma n = 768 , colorectal adenocarcinoma n = 257) , we demonstrate that the frequent chromosomal losses of the tumor suppressor CDKN2A in melanoma and other tumor entities enhance the susceptibility to IFNγ resistance by concomitant deletion of the JAK2 gene ( odds ratio = 223.17 , 95 % confidence interval = 66.91 to 1487.38 , two-sided P = 7.6 × 10-46). Tumors with JAK2 mutations or homozygous JAK2 deletions demonstrate allelic losses covering both CDKN2A and JAK2. This suggests that patients with tumor chromosomal CDKN2A losses are susceptible to developing immunotherapy resistance and should be screened for JAK2 deficiency prior to and under immune checkpoint blocking therapy.
