  The limited host tropism of numerous viruses causing disease in humans remains incompletely understood. One example is Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) , an RNA virus that has reemerged in recent years. Here , we demonstrate that ZIKV efficiently infects fibroblasts from humans , great apes , New and Old World monkeys , but not rodents. ZIKV infection in human-but not murine-cells impairs responses to agonists of the cGMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of IFN genes ( cGAS/STING) signaling pathway , suggesting that viral mechanisms to evade antiviral defenses are less effective in rodent cells. Indeed , human , but not mouse , STING is subject to cleavage by proteases encoded by ZIKV , dengue<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , West<pathogen> Nile<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , and Japanese<pathogen> encephalitis<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , but not that of yellow<pathogen> fever<pathogen> virus<pathogen> The protease cleavage site , located between positions 78/79 of human STING , is only partially conserved in nonhuman primates and rodents , rendering these orthologs resistant to degradation. Genetic disruption of STING increases the susceptibility of mouse-but not human-cells to ZIKV. Accordingly , expression of only mouse , not human , STING in murine STING knockout cells rescues the ZIKV suppression phenotype. STING-deficient mice , however , did not exhibit increased susceptibility , suggesting that other redundant antiviral pathways control ZIKV infection in vivo. Collectively , our data demonstrate that numerous RNA viruses evade cGAS/STING-dependent signaling and affirm the importance of this pathway in shaping the host range of ZIKV. Furthermore , our results explain-at least in part-the decreased permissivity of rodent cells to ZIKV , which could aid in the development of mice model with inheritable susceptibility to ZIKV and other flaviviruses.
