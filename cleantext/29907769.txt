  Cancer cells have been found to frequently express genes that are normally restricted to the testis , often referred to as cancer/testis ( CT) antigens or genes. Because germ cell-specific antigens are not recognized as `` self '' by the innate immune system , CT-genes have previously been suggested as ideal candidate targets for cancer therapy. The use of CT-genes in cancer therapy has thus far been unsuccessful , most likely because their identification has relied on gene expression in whole testis , including the testicular somatic cells , precluding the detection of true germ cell-specific genes. By comparing the transcriptomes of micro-dissected germ cell subtypes , representing the main developmental stages of human spermatogenesis , with the publicly accessible transcriptomes of 2617 samples from 49 different healthy somatic tissues and 9232 samples from 33 tumor types , we here discover hundreds of true germ cell-specific cancer expressed genes. Strikingly , we found these germ cell cancer genes ( GC-genes) to be widely expressed in all analyzed tumors. Many GC-genes appeared to be involved in processes that are likely to actively promote tumor viability , proliferation and metastasis. Targeting these true GC-genes thus has the potential to inhibit tumor growth with infertility<symptom> being the only possible side effect. Moreover , we identified a subset of GC-genes that are not expressed in spermatogonial stem cells. Targeting of this GC-gene subset is predicted to only lead to temporary infertility<symptom> , as untargeted spermatogonial stem cells can recover spermatogenesis after treatment. Our GC-gene dataset enables improved understanding of tumor biology and provides multiple novel targets for cancer treatment.
