  To investigate the effects of apple polyphenol on cell proliferation and migration of breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 , and explore the potential mechanism. The breast cancer cells in the logarithmic phase were treated with 0 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 400 and 800 μg/m L of apple polyphenol for 24 , 48 and 72 h , then Trypan blue staining was employed to detect cell vitality; CCK8 kit was used to determine cell growth and proliferation; cell migration ability was observed by scratch experiment , and the change of proteins expression level was assessed by Western blot. Apple polyphenol could content-dependently inhibit breast cancer cell 's vitality and proliferation between 0 and 800 μg/m L , decrease the proteins level of ubiquitinlike with PHD and ring finger domain 1 ( UHRF1) and matrix metalloproteinases-2 ( MMP2) , and the protein levels of DNA methyltransferases 3 a ( DNMT3 a) and DNMT3 b , themolecular targets of UHRF1 , also decreased. Apple polyphenol inhibition of cell 's migration was more significant between 400 and 800 μg/mL. Apple polyphenol inhibited the vitality , cell growth and proliferation , and migration of breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 by decreasing the proteins expression of UHRF1 and MMP2 , and the downstream targets of UHRF1 , DNMT3 a and DNMT3 b , also decreased.
