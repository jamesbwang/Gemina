  To study if programmed death-ligand 1 ( PL-L1) expression in breast cancer cell activates PD-L1/ PD-1 pathway in dendritic cells to inhibit dendritic cell maturation. Human monocytes were induced to differentiate into immature dendritic cells using GM-CSF and IL-4 , and further to mature dendritic cells using TNF-α. PD-L1-expressing breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was co-cultured in contact with the dendritic cells to observe the effects of the breast cancer cells on the maturation of the dendritic cells. A PD-L1 blocking antibody was applied to the co-culture , and the changes in the inhibitory effect of the MDA-MB-231 cells on dendritic cell maturation was observed. TNF-α-induced dendritic cells were treated with a recombinant human PD-L1 protein to study the effect of PD-L1/ PD-1 pathway activation on the maturation of dendritic cells. The expression of PD-L1 in MDA-MB-231 cells and the dendritic cell maturation marker HLA-DR and CD83 were analyzed using flow cytometry. MDA-MB-231 cell line showed PD-L1 positivity on the cell membrane cells at a rate as high as ( 99.7 ∓ 0.15) %. In mature dendritic cells , the positivity rates for HLA-DR and CD83 were ( 88.8 ∓ 6.96) % and ( 18.36 ∓ 3.07) % , respectively , but in the co-culture system , the positivity rates of the dendritic cells were significantly decreased to ( 42.76 ∓ 10.52) % ( P < 0.01) and ( 9.93 ∓ 2.74) % ( P < 0.05) , respectively , indicating that MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited the maturation of dendritic cells. Following treatment with a PD-L1 antibody isotype control , the percentages of HLA-DR- and CD83-positive cells in the co-culture were ( 45.17 ∓ 10.19) % and ( 10.15 ∓ 2.54) % , which were significantly increased to ( 63.46 ∓ 1.72) % and ( 16.46 ∓ 2.58) % after treatment with PD-L1 antibody , respectively ( both P < 0.05). Compared with the mature dendritic cell controls , the cells treated with the recombinant human PD-L1 protein exhibited significantly lowered percentages of HLA-DR-positive ( from ( 84.23 ∓ 4.18) % to ( 2.56 ∓ 2.39) % , P < 0.05) and CD83-positive cells ( ( 87.26 ∓ 1.54) % to ( 60.67 ∓ 1.63) % , P < 0.05). The effect of PD-L1 antibody therapy on triple negative breast cancer can be partially mediated by blocking PD-L1 expression on breast cancer cell membrane , which attenuates the inhibition of dendritic cell maturation in the cancer microenvironment.
