  Ulvan , a marine sulfated polysaccharide isolated from green algae<pathogen> , has been recently recognized as a natural biopolymer of biomedical interest. A series of lysozyme/ulvan complexes prepared under various charge ratios at physiological pH were studied. The resulting complexes were examined with light scattering techniques in order to characterize the size , the distribution and the Î¶-potential of the nanocarriers , which were found to depend on the charge ratio employed. Increased complexation efficiency of lysozyme was observed for certain charge ratios , while ATR-FTIR data suggested that the protein structure after complexation was retained. Bacterial growth studies showed that lysozyme once complexed with ulvan not only retains its antibacterial activity against the Gram positive strain Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , but actually exhibits increased levels of activity. In this model study , the results highlight the potential of ulvan as a promising nanocarrier for positively charged bioactive molecules.
