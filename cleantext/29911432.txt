  In 2 distinct entities , left ventricular noncompaction ( LVNC) and peripartum cardiomyopathy ( PPCM) , routine anticoagulation therapy is often used in current practices. However , our systematic review showed that LVNC itself was not associated with the increase in thromboembolism event rates and therapeutic anticoagulation therapy should not be considered only for LVNC , unless there is risk factor for thromboembolism. Current literature justifies prophylactic therapeutic anticoagulation in LVNC with low left ventricular ejection fraction ( EF < 40 %) and/or atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. Although not specifically studied , the presence of intracardiac thrombi by echocardiography or other imaging studies should also prompt anticoagulation therapy. There is limited evidence available for the use of anticoagulation in patients with PPCM , but our systematic review showed that anticoagulation should be recommended only for patients with PPCM especially with an EF < 35 % until EF is recovered , as well as for patients with PPCM treated with bromocriptine.
