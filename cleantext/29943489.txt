  Metformin is an oral anti-diabetic therapy ( ADT) to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) , and has been reported to have potential anti-tuberculosis ( TB) effects. This study investigates the risk of active TB among persons with T2DM who were treated with various ADT and insulin therapies. We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study using the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database , including 49028 T2DM patients who were metformin users ( n = 44002) or non-users ( n = 5026). A total of 5026 propensity score-matched pairs of metformin users and non-users with T2DM were evaluated from 1998 to 2010. The data were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models. Patients with T2DM had a significantly higher rate of incident TB than did the control subjects ( adjusted hazard ratio: 2.01; 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI): 1.80-2.25). After adjusting for comorbidities , diabetes complications , ADT type and statin use , metformin use was an independent factor for predicting a reduced risk of active TB ( adjusted relative risk ( aRR): 0.24; 95 % CI: 0.18-0.32). The association between metformin use and active TB risk was also consistent in most subgroup analyses , except for patients with metabolic disorders ( aRR: 0.46; 95 % CI: 0.11-1.87). This protective effect of metformin was dose-dependent but diminished gradually in the elderly population. Among all types of ADT and insulin therapies , metformin is the only agent with a decreased risk of active TB in the T2DM population. However , this effect was diminished in the elderly population and was not observed in patients with metabolic disorders.
