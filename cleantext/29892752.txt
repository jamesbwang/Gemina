  The in vivo toxicity of QDs in animals has been broadly studied; however , their reproductive toxicity towards lactating rodents is currently unknown. This study therefore aims to assess the potential toxicity against dams and offspring after postnatal QD exposure at two doses ( 5 and 1 nmol per rat) and unravel whether QDs can translocate to pups via breastfeeding. The dose-dependent systemic toxicity of QDs in dams was observed by examining the body<symptom> weight , hematology , biochemistry , histopathological changes , and sex hormone levels. It was found that the QDs primarily accumulated in the liver and spleen of dams at 1 day post injection ( dpi) , but the highest concentrations were found in the kidneys at 18 dpi. A few QDs were detected in breast milk and stomach and intestine of pups; this suggested that the QDs were transmitted to breast milk via blood circulation and then transferred to pups via breastfeeding. High-dose QDs induced severe growth inhibition and a 71.08 % offspring mortality , while pups showed growth restriction within 90 dpi in the low-dose group. Moreover , the hematology , biochemistry , and histology results showed limited chronic toxicity against offspring in the long term. This study provides a theoretical foundation for the exposure assessment of nanomaterials in lactating animals and for the advancement of QDs in the biomedical field.
