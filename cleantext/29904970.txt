  Registered nurses working in the area of mental health complete either a psychiatric/mental health or comprehensive/generalist nursing program , and their education preparation influences their physical health care nursing practices. The differences in educational preparation may be a contributory factor to nurses ' delivery of physical health care to young people experiencing first episode psychosis. This paper addresses an identified gap in nursing practices related to physical health care of young mental health service users. To examine the relationship between the educational preparation of nurses and attitudes , confidence level , perceived barriers and physical health care nursing practices. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2015 with 207 nurses using the modified Physical Health Attitude Scale for Mental Health Nurses ( PHASe). Comprehensive/generalist prepared nurses were more likely to provide education on heart disease prevention and sexual health and support young people to stop cigarette smoking than psychiatric/mental health nurses. However , as the length of service progresses , the propensity for psychiatric/mental health nurses to be involve in smoking cessation increases. It is important to identify how nurses ' educational preparation affects their nursing practices so as to address the gaps in their physical health literacy. This article is protected by copyright.
