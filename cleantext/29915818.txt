  Herein , we report the detailed structural characterization and photoluminescence ( PL) properties of two new isostructural coordination polymers ( CPs) based on 2-aminonicotinate ( 2ani) ligand and zinc ( ii) or cadmium ( ii) metal ions , namely , ( M ( μ-2ani) 2) n ( MII = Zn ( 1) and Cd ( 2)). These compounds are characterized as chiral 2D-layered structures , resulting from the bridging of the 2ani ligands in the MN2O4 coordination shell. Also , strong supramolecular interactions are found to sustain the overall crystal structure , which endows these materials with high stability. The single crystals of 1 exhibit waveguiding behaviour along some preferred orientations. The examination of the polycrystalline samples of both compounds under UV light also shows that the samples exhibit remarkably strong PL emissions , which consist of blue fluorescence and green phosphorescence involving long-lasting phosphorescence ( LLP) at low temperature. Fitting of the decay curves confirms the occurrence of short ( in the order of nanoseconds) and very large lifetimes ( τ ≈ 320 and 560 ms for 1 and 2 , respectively) of the wavelengths responsible for their blue and green emissions , respectively , which have been studied using DFT calculations.
