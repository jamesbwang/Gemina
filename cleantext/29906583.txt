  To evaluate the prevalence , incidence , morbidity , and mortality rates of cervical ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament ( OPLL) , using data from a 12-year national cohort of 1,025,340 Korean people. A nested case-control cohort study was performed using the insurance claims database , during 2002 to 2013 , provided by the National Health Insurance Service. We examined the prevalence and incidence of cervical OPLL. Age/sex-matched controls were randomly extracted , with 10 times the number of OPLL cases. The differences in sex , co-morbidity , and relative survival rate , compared with controls , were assessed. The cumulative prevalence was 20,960 per 1,025,340 people for 12 years. The annual incidence was approximately 199 to 371 per 1 million people. Overall , the crude mortality rate was 7.64 %. The relative survival rate of OPLL cases was not significantly different from that of control cases. Diabetes , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , and cerebrovascular disease , except renal disease , correlated significantly with OPLL , compared with controls ( p < 0.001). Additionally , between dead and surviving patients among the OPLL cases , all co-morbidities correlated more significantly with death ( p < 0.001). Further , between the surgery and non-surgery cases of OPLL , diabetes , hypertension , and renal disease ( p < 0.05) were significantly associated with surgery. The annual incidences of OPLL were from 199 to 371 per 1,025,340 people for 10 years. Diabetes , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , and cerebrovascular disease , except renal disease , correlated significantly with OPLL , compared with controls. Especially , diabetes , hypertension , and renal disease were associated with OPLL patients who underwent surgery.
