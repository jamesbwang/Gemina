  Exposure is an effective intervention in the treatment of pathological anxiety<symptom> , but it is insufficiently disseminated. Therapists ' negative attitudes towards exposure might be of relevance when considering factors contributing to the non-application of this intervention. In order to be able to measure concerns in German-speaking therapist populations , the study aimed at validating a German version of the Therapist Beliefs about Exposure Scale. The scale was translated into the German language and validated in a sample of 330 German licensed cognitive behavioural therapists. In the present sample , the mean total score was significantly lower than in the original study including US-American therapists. Confirmatory factor analysis did not confirm the proposed one-factor model , while the exploratory factor analysis indicated that more than one factor is necessary to explain the structure of negative attitudes towards exposure. The internal consistency was high. Higher scores ( more negative beliefs) were significantly correlated with older age , holding a master 's degree ( vs PhD) , not being specialized in the treatment of anxiety<symptom> disorders and with less experience with performance of exposure gained during clinical training. Negative beliefs about exposure were further associated with the self-reported average number of sessions spent on exposure in current treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and panic disorder , and with negative attitudes towards application of exposure sessions presented in case vignettes. The German adaptation provides the opportunity of measuring concerns regarding application of exposure in German-speaking therapist populations. However , the presented data reveal suggestions for further scale development.
