  Peony seed oil has recently been introduced as a high-quality food oil. Because the high price of peony seed oil may tempt unscrupulous merchants to dilute it with cheaper substitutes , a rapid detection method for likely adulterants is required. In this study , the fatty acid composition of peony seed oil and four less expensive edible oils ( soybean oil , corn oil , sunflower oil , and rapeseed oil) were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Peony oil adulterated by other edible oils was assessed using iodine values to estimate the extent of adulteration. Adulteration was also measured using an electronic nose ( E-nose) combined with principal component analysis ( PCA) or linear discriminant analysis ( LDA). Results indicated that peony seed oil was highly enriched in Î±-linolenic acid. Although the iodine value can be used to detect some adulterants by measuring unsaturation , it was not able to detect all four potential adulterants. In contrast , the E-nose can rapidly identify adulterated peony seed oil by sampling vapor. Data analyses using PCA and LDA show that LDA more effectively clusters the data , discriminates between pure and adulterated oil , and can detect adulteration at the 10 % level. E-nose combined with LDA suitable for detection of peony seed oil adulteration.
