  Studies have previously shown that mutant calreticulin ( CALR) , found in a subset of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPNs) , interacts with and subsequently promotes the activation of the thrombopoietin receptor ( MPL). However , the molecular mechanism behind the activity of mutant CALR remains unknown. Here we show that mutant , but not wild-type , CALR interacts to form a homomultimeric complex. This intermolecular interaction among mutant CALR proteins depends on their carboxyl-terminal domain , which is generated by a unique frameshift mutation found in patients with MPN. With a competition assay , we demonstrated that the formation of mutant CALR homomultimers is required for the binding and activation of MPL. Since association with MPL is required for the oncogenicity of mutant CALR , we propose a model in which the constitutive activation of the MPL downstream pathway by mutant CALR multimers induces the development of MPN. This study provides a potential novel therapeutic strategy against mutant CALR-dependent tumorigenesis via targeting the intermolecular interaction among mutant CALR proteins.
