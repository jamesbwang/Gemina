  Melanoma is the most lethal type of skin cancer , with increasing incidence and mortality rates worldwide. Multiple studies have demonstrated a link between cancer development/progression and circadian disruption; however , the complex role of tumor-autonomous molecular clocks remains poorly understood. With that in mind , we investigated the pathophysiological relevance of clock genes expression in metastatic melanoma. We analyzed gene expression , somatic mutation , and clinical data from 340 metastatic melanomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas , as well as gene expression data from 234 normal skin samples from genotype-tissue expression. Findings were confirmed in independent datasets. In melanomas , the expression of most clock genes was remarkably reduced and displayed a disrupted pattern of co-expression compared to the normal skins<disease> , indicating a dysfunctional circadian clock. Importantly , we demonstrate that the expression of the clock gene aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 ( Overall , our data corroborate previous reports regarding the impact of
