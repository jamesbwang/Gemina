  T follicular helper CD4 cells ( Tfh) are essential for the development and maintenance of germinal center ( GC) reactions , a critical process that promotes the generation of long-lived high affinity humoral immunity. It is becoming increasingly evident that GC-Tfh cells are heterogeneous in nature with some cellular characteristics associated with a Th1 , Th2 , and Th17 phenotype. Emerging studies suggest that GC-Tfh cells are directed to differentiate into distinct phenotypes during chronic HIV/SIV infection and these changes in GC-Tfh cells can greatly impact the B cell response and subclass of antibodies generated. Studies in HIV-infected humans have shown that certain Tfh phenotypes are associated with the generation of broadly neutralizing antibody responses. Moreover , the susceptibility of particular GC-Tfh subsets to HIV<pathogen> infection within the secondary lymphoid sites can also impact GC-Tfh/B cell interactions. In this review , we discuss the recent advances that show Tfh heterogeneity during chronic HIV/SIV infection. In particular , we will discuss the dynamics of GC-Tfh cells , their altered differentiation state and function , and their impact on B cell responses during HIV/SIV infection. In addition , we will also discuss the potential role of a recently described novel subset of follicular homing CXCR5
