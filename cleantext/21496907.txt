  An estimated 2.6 million stillbirths<symptom> occur every year , with the majority occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Understanding the cause of and factors associated with stillbirth<symptom> is important to help inform the design and implementation of interventions aimed at reducing preventable stillbirths<symptom>. Population-based surveillance with identification of all stillbirths<symptom> that occurred either at home or in a health facility was introduced in four districts in Bangladesh. Verbal autopsy was conducted for every fifth stillbirth<symptom> using a structured questionnaire. A hierarchical model was used to assign likely cause of stillbirth<symptom>. Six thousand three hundred thirty-three stillbirths<symptom> were identified for which 1327 verbal autopsies were conducted. 63.9 % were intrapartum stillbirths<symptom>. The population-based stillbirth<symptom> rate obtained was 20.4 per 1000 births; 53.9 % of all stillbirths<symptom> occurred at home. 69.6 % of mothers had accessed health care in the period leading up to the stillbirth<symptom>. 48.1 % had received care from a highly trained healthcare provider. The three most frequent causes of stillbirth<symptom> were maternal hypertension or eclampsia ( 15.2 %) , antepartum haemorrhage ( 13.7 %) and maternal infections ( 8.9 %). Up to 11.3 % of intrapartum stillbirths<symptom> were caused by hypoxia. However , it was not possible to identify a cause of death with reasonable certainty using information obtained via verbal autopsy in 51.9 % of stillbirths<symptom>. Introducing surveillance for stillbirths<symptom> at community level is possible. However , verbal autopsy yields limited data , and the questionnaire used for this needs to be revised and/or combined with information obtained through case note review. Most women accessed and received care from a qualified healthcare provider. To reduce the number of preventable stillbirths<symptom> , the quality of antenatal and intrapartum care needs to be improved.
