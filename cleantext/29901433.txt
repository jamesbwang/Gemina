  Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension<symptom> ( NOH) , is a cardinal feature of autonomic dysfunction. The cortical autonomic network ( CAN) is a network of brain regions associated with autonomic function. Therefore , our objective was to investigate whether impairment of CAN structures is involved in the pathophysiology of NOH. Fifteen controls ( 63 ± 13 years) and fifteen NOH patients ( 67 ± 6 years; p = 0.2) with peripheral autonomic dysfunction completed standard tests of parasympathetic ( Deep Breathing ( DB)) and sympathetic ( Valsalva maneuver ( VM)) activation during a functional MRI. Blood-oxygen level dependent ( BOLD) contrasts were obtained and contrasted. Hemodynamics: Compared to controls , patients had significantly smaller heart rate responses to DB ( C: 15.23 ± 9.6 vs. NOH: 5.7 ± 2.1) and Valsalva ratios ( C: 2.1 ± 0.47 vs. NOH: 1.2 ± 0.1; p < 0.001). NOH patients had absent adrenergic phases ( late phase II and phase IV) during VM as per a qualitative analysis. BOLD: During VM , controls had greater activation in the right hippocampus ( T-value: 8.03) , left posterior cingulate ( T NOH patients have significantly less CAN activation during sympathetic , but not parasympathetic , activation. Impaired cortical autonomic networks associated with sympathetic activation may be involved in the pathophysiology of NOH.
