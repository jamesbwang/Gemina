  The functional impact of modifications of cellular RNAs , including mRNAs , miRNAs and lncRNAs , is a field of intense study. The role of such modifications in cancer has started to be elucidated. Diverse and sometimes opposite effects of RNA modifications have been reported. Some RNA modifications promote , while others decrease the growth and invasiveness of cancer. The present manuscript reviews the current knowledge on the potential impacts of N6-Methyladenosine , Pseudouridine , Inosine , 2 ` O-methylation or methylcytidine in cancer 's RNA. It also highlights the remaining questions and provides hints on research avenues and potential therapeutic applications , whereby modulating dynamic RNA modifications may be a new method to treat cancer.
