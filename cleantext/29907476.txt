  Tubulinopathies include a wide spectrum of disorders ranging from abnormal ocular movement to severe brain malformations , and typically present as diffuse agyria or perisylvian pachygyria with microcephaly , agenesis of the corpus callosum , and cerebellar hypoplasia. They are caused by the dysfunction of tubulins encoded by tubulin-related genes , and the TUBA1A gene encoding alpha-1A tubulin is most frequently responsible for this clinical entity. Porencephaly is relatively rare among patients with the TUBA1A mutations. Mild case of tubulinopathy associated with porencephaly caused by a novel TUBA1A mutation. The patient , a 10-month-old girl , presented with gross motor delay at 4 months of age and convulsions<symptom> at 7 months of age. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed porencephaly , occipital polymicrogyria , hypoplasia of the corpus callosum , volume loss of the white matter , dysgenesis of anterior limbs of internal capsules , non-separative basal ganglia , cerebellar hypoplasia , and dysplastic brainstem. We identified a novel de novo heterozygous missense mutation in the TUBA1A gene , c. 381C > A ( p.Asp127Glu) , by whole-exome sequencing. Microtubules composed of tubulins regulate not only neuronal migration but also cell division or axon guidance. Accordingly , tubulinopathy affects the cortical lamination , brain size , callosal formation , and white matter as seen in the present case. In contrast to the previously reported cases , the present case showed milder cortical dysgenesis with a rare manifestation of porencephaly. The genotype-phenotype correlation is still unclear , and this study expands the phenotypic range of tubulinopathy.
