  Recent changes in lung cancer care , including new approvals in first line and the introduction of high-throughput molecular technologies in routine testing led us to question ourselves on how deeper molecular testing may be helpful for the optimal use of targeted drugs. In this article , we review recent results in the scope of personalized medicine in lung cancer. We discuss biomarkers that have a therapeutic predictive value in lung cancer with a focus on recent changes and on the clinical value of large scale sequencing strategies. We review the use of second- and third-generation EGFR and ALK inhibitors with a focus on secondary resistance alterations. We discuss anti-BRAF and anti-MEK combo , emerging biomarkers as NRG1 and NTRKs fusions and immunotherapy. Finally , we discuss the different technical issues of comprehensive molecular profiling and show how large screenings might refine the prediction value of individual markers. Based on a review of recent publications ( 2012 ‚Åª 2018) , we address promising approaches for the treatment of patients with lung cancers and the technical challenges associated with the identification of new predictive markers.
