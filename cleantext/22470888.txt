  This study aimed to formulate and characterize Medicated The results revealed that drugs and polymers were compatible to formulate. All formulations were light yellow , clear and syringeable except formulation having 2.5 % w/v chitosan. pH was in the range of 6.20 to 6.74. 1.0 % w/v and 1.5 % w/v chitosan formulations showed gelation temperature 37 ± 0.32 °C and 34 ± 0.21 °C. Further , mucoadhesive strength indicated mucoadhesivity of gel. In conclusion , optimized 1.5 % w/v chitosan
