  Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) have been known to be suffering from coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ10) deficiency which results in some complications in them. The purpose of this clinical trial study was to evaluate the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on serum values of adiponectin ( A) , leptin ( L) , 8-isoprostane , malondialdehyde ( MDA) , the A/L ratio in women with T2DM. Sixty-eight women with T2DM were enrolled in the current study and were randomly divided into drug ( n = 34) and placebo ( n = 34) groups who were consuming 100 mg CoQ10 and 100 mg cellulose acetate per day for 12 weeks , respectively. Measurements were performed at the beginning and after the intervention. Serum values of adiponectin ( p = .001) and the A/L ratio ( p = .001) were increased while values of leptin ( p = .041) , MDA ( p = .023) , 8-isoprostane ( p = .004) were decreased significantly in drug group after intervention. This study had shown that CoQ10 supplementation in women with T2DM was effective in elevation of adiponectin and the A/L ratio and reduction of leptin , MDA and 8-isoprostane which could result in improving insulin resistance and modulating oxidative stress situation.
