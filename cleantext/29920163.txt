  Schistosomiasis is one of the major communicable diseases of public health and socioeconomic importance in the developing world. It is a waterborne disease in which Biomphalaria alexandrina snails are known to be the intermediate molluscan host for Schistosoma mansoni: the causative agent of human intestinal schistosomiasis. Therefore , snail control is one of the cornerstones of schistosomiasis control programs. Several methods have been used to eliminate snail hosts. One of these methods is chemical molluscicides , which have undesirable effect to nontarget organisms. Consequently , the search for biologically derived molluscicides to complement the use of synthetic molluscicides is a top priority. In this concern , this study is the first to evaluate the molluscicidal potency of Cyanobacterial Phycocyanin ( C-PC) as a virtually untapped source. Laboratory assessment of three freshwater Cyanobacterial strains: Anabaena oryzae<pathogen> SOS13 , Nostoc muscorum SOS14 , and Spirulina platensis SOS13-derived C-Phycocyanin as a biocontrol agent against freshwater mollusks; B. alexandrina snails were performed. Also , the safety of tested C-PC on nontarget organisms ( Tilapia fish) was assessed. Results reveal that C-PC extracted from all tested Cyanobacteria strains showed a promising molluscicidal activity ( the mortality rate was 100 % at 100 Î¼g/mL concentration). Out of the examined strains , A.<pathogen> oryzae<pathogen> SOS13 phycocyanin was found to be the most potent strain ( LC
