  Basophils are blood granulocytes and normally constitute less than 1 % of blood peripheral leukocytes. Basophils share some morphological and functional similarities with mast cells , and basophils were once regarded as redundant and negligible circulating mast cells. However , recent studies reveal the indispensable roles of basophils in various diseases , including allergic and pruritic diseases. Basophils may be involved in itch through the mediation of a Th2 immune response , interaction with other cells in the skin , and secretion of a wide variety of itch-related mediators , e.g. , histamine , cytokines and chemokines ( IL-4 , IL-13 , IL-31 , and TSLP) , proteases ( cathepsin S) , prostaglandins ( PGE2 and PGD2) , substance P , and platelet-activating factor. Not only pruritic skin diseases ( e.g. , atopic dermatitis<disease> , irritant contact dermatitis<disease> , chronic urticaria , prurigo , papulo-erythroderma of Ofuji , eosinophilic pustular folliculitis , scabies , tick bites , and bullous pemphigoid) but also pruritic systemic<disease> diseases<disease> ( e.g. , primary sclerosing cholangitis and polycythemia vera) may be affected by basophils.
