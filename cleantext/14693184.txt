  Recent studies have suggested that temporal dynamics rather than symmetrical motion-direction contribute to mirror-symmetry perception. Here we investigate temporal aspects of symmetry perception and implicitly , its temporal flexibility and limitations , by examining how symmetrical pattern elements are combined over time. Stimuli were dynamic dot-patterns consisting of either an on-going alternation of two images ( sustained stimulus presentation) or just two images each presented once ( transient stimulus presentation) containing different amounts of symmetry about the vertical axis. We varied the duration of the two images under five temporal-arrangement conditions: ( a) whole patterns in which a symmetric pattern alternated with a noise pattern; ( b) delayed halves-the halves of the symmetric and noise patterns were presented with temporal delay; ( c) matched-pairs-two alternating images each containing equal amounts of symmetrical matched-pairs; ( d) delayed matched-pairs-the same as arrangement ( c) , but with matched-pairs presented with delay; and ( e) static-both images presented simultaneously as one. We found increased sensitivity in sustained compared to transient stimulus presentations and with synchronous compared to delayed matched-pairs stimuli. For the delayed conditions , sensitivity decreased gradually with longer image durations ( > 60 ms) , prominently for the transient stimulus presentations. We conclude that spatial correlations across-the-symmetry-midline can be integrated over time ( ∼ 120 ms) , and symmetry mechanisms can tolerate temporal delays between symmetric dot-pairs of up to ∼ 60 ms.
