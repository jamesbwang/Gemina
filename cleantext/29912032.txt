  Spinopelvic dissociation is a rare injury resulting in discontinuity between the spine and pelvis. We review the English- language literature and discuss critical treatment controversies. We present a series of spinopelvic dissociation cases from a level I trauma center. In this retrospective review of 18 consecutive cases treated surgically over a period of 4 years , we collected patient , injury , and surgical demographics and clinical and radiographic outcome measures. Twelve patients had associated injuries , five were intubated on arrival , and six had neurologic deficits at presentation. No patient had spinal decompression , and all patients underwent closed reduction and percutaneous fixation. There were no cases of iatrogenic nerve injury , despite the use of partially threaded sacroiliac screws and closed reduction techniques. Five patients showed progressive neurologic improvement postoperatively. After reduction , eight patients ( 44 %) had radiographic loss of the sacrococcygeal angle at the latest follow-up , but correction of fracture translation was preserved in all. Spinopelvic dissociation represents a heterogeneous group of injuries often in the context of polytraumatized patients with other injuries. Our closed reduction and fixation technique resulted in satisfactory outcomes. We present a treatment algorithm for these rare injuries.
