  In sickle cell disease ( SCD) , ` disease severity ' associates with increased RBC adhesion to quiescent endothelium , but the impact on activated endothelium is not known. Increased concentrations of free heme result from intravascular hemolysis<symptom> in SCD. Heme is essential for aerobic metabolism , and plays an important role in numerous biological processes. Excess free heme induces reactive oxygen species generation and endothelial activation , which are associated with cardiovascular disorders including atherosclerosis , hypertension , and thrombosis. Here , we utilized an endothelialized microfluidic platform ( Endothelium-on-a-chip) to assess adhesion of sickle hemoglobin-containing red blood cells ( HbS RBCs) , from adults with homozygous SCD , to heme-activated human endothelial cells ( EC) in vitro. Confluent EC monolayers in microchannels were treated with pathophysiologically relevant levels of heme in order to simulate the highly hemolytic intravascular milieu seen in SCD. RBC adhesion to heme-activated ECs varied from subject to subject , and was associated with plasma markers of hemolysis<symptom> ( LDH) and reticulocytosis , thereby linking those RBCs that are most likely to adhere with those that are most likely to hemolyze. These results re-emphasize the critical contribution made by heterogeneous adhesive HbS RBCs to the pathophysiology of SCD. We found that adhesion of HbS RBCs to heme-activated ECs varied amongst individuals in the study population , and associated with biomarkers of hemolysis<symptom> and inflammation<symptom> , age , and a recent history of transfusion. Importantly , the microfluidic approach described herein holds promise as a clinically feasible Endothelium-on-a-chip platform with which to study complex heterocellular adhesive interactions in SCD.
