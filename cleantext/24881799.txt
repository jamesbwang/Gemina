  Previous research in various species has shown that granulocyte-colony stimulating factor stimulates the production and release of neutrophils from bone<disease> marrow. The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of polyethylene glycol-bound bovine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( pegbovigrastim; Imrestor , Elanco) on circulating leukocyte counts. Thirty-four Holstein cows were randomly assigned to receive 2 injections of either physiologic saline ( n = 16) or pegbovigrastim ( n = 18) , 7 days before expected calving ( d -7) and within 24 hours after calving ( d 0). Cows were sampled at d -7 , d -6 , d 0 , d +1 , d +7 , and d +21 , relative to calving. Only cows for which the interval from the first injection to calving was ≥ 4 d and ≤ 10 d were included , such that the interval ( mean ± SD) from first treatment to calving was 6.7 ± 1.9 d. Treatment effects were assessed with mixed linear regression models. After the first injection , neutrophil counts ( × 109/ L) in pegbovigrastim-treated cows increased from 4.3 ( 95 % CI 3.8 to 4.8) at d -7 to 18.2 ( CI 16.3 to 20.3) at d -6 ( P < 0.0001). Their counts then decreased from d -6 to d 0 , when the second injection was administered , at a rate of -0.31 × 109 neutrophils/L/day ( P < 0.0001). After the second injection , neutrophil counts increased from 16.4 ( CI 13.7 to 19.6) at d 0 to 32.8 ( CI 25.2 to 42.7) at d +1 ( P < 0.0001) , after which counts decreased at a rate of -3.73 × 109 neutrophils/L/day until d +7 ( P < 0.0001). Counts continued to decrease from d +7 to d +21 at a slower rate of -0.43 × 109 neutrophils/L/day ( P < 0.0001) , until baseline levels were reached. Conversely , in control cows , neutrophil counts were unchanged from d -7 to d -6 ( P = 0.86) after the first injection and then decreased from 6.1 ( CI 5.0-7.3) at d 0 , to 3.2 ( CI 2.4-4.2) at d +1 ( P < 0.0001) after the second injection. Neutrophil count was greater ( P < 0.001) in pegbovigrastim-treated than in control cows at days -6 , 0 , +1 and +7. Area under the curve ( cells × 109/ L per 28 d) for neutrophil counts in the pegbovigrastim group was 429 , versus 99 in the control group ( P < 0.0001). The response to each injection of pegbovigrastim was additive and consisted of 95 % segmented neutrophils , suggesting that the effect of the treatment was to release mature neutrophils from a substantial pool available in the bone<disease> marrow. The sustained increase in circulating neutrophil count around the time of calving may contribute to improved health during the peripartum transition period.
