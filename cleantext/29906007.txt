  Myopericytoma is a soft-tissue tumor of perivascular cells ( pericytes). It is slow-growing , usually asymptomatic , and generally benign , although a malignant variant has been described. The etiology is unknown , but it has been associated with local trauma. The most common location is on the distal extremities. Histologically , it is characterized by a well-circumscribed , non-encapsulated proliferation of spindle shaped cells similar to myofibroblasts with oval nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm , arranged in perivascular concentric rings. There are few mitoses and no necrosis<symptom> is reported. The immunohistochemical analysis is positive for smooth muscle actin and negative or weakly positive for desmin. A low Ki-67 proliferation index is typical. Treatment is surgical excision with free margins. Recurrences after adequate excision are uncommon. We describe a 48-year-old woman with a myopericytoma in an unusual location ( next to the inner corner of her left eye) who was treated with surgical excision; there has been no recurrence after 5 years of follow up.
