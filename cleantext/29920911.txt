  Reports detailing the morbidity-mortality after left colectomy are sparse and do not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn. We aimed to identify risk factors for anastomotic leakage , perioperative mortality and complications following left colectomy for colonic malignancies. We undertook a STROBE-compliant analysis of left colectomies included in a national prospective online database. Forty-two variables were analysed as potential independent risk factors for anastomotic leakage , postoperative morbidity and mortality. Variables were selected using the ` least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ' ( LASSO) method. We analysed 1111 patients. Eight per cent of patients had a leakage and in 80 % of them reoperation or surgical drainage was needed. A quarter of patients ( 24.9 %) experienced at least one minor complication. Perioperative mortality was 2 % , leakage being responsible for 47.6 % of deaths. Obesity ( OR 2.8 , 95 % CI 1.00-7.05 , P = 0.04) and total parenteral nutrition ( TPN) ( OR 3.7 , 95 % CI 1.58-8.51 , P = 0.002) were associated with increased risk of leakage , whereas female patients had a lower risk ( OR 0.36 , 95 % CI 0.18-0.67 , P = 0.002). Corticosteroids ( P = 0.03) and oral anticoagulants ( P = 0.01) doubled the risk of complications , which was lower with hyperlipidaemia ( OR 0.3 , P = 0.02). Patients on TPN had more complications ( OR 4.02 , 95 % CI 2.03-8.07 , P = 0.04) and higher mortality ( OR 8.7 , 95 % CI 1.8-40.9 , P = 0.006). Liver disease and advanced age impaired survival , corticosteroids being the strongest predictor of mortality ( OR 21.5 , P = 0.001). Requirement for TPN was associated with more leaks , complications and mortality. Leakage was presumably responsible for almost half of deaths. Hyperlipidaemia and female gender were associated with lower rates of complications. These findings warrant a better understanding of metabolic status on perioperative outcome after left colectomy.
