  Stroke is a major cause of disability worldwide , and is the second leading cause of death after ischemic heart disease. Until recently , tissue-type plasminogen activator ( t-PA) was the only treatment for acute ischemic stroke. If administered within 4.5 h of symptom onset , t-PA improves the outcome in stroke patients. Mechanical thrombectomy is now the preferred treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke resulting from a large-artery occlusion in the anterior circulation. However , the widespread use of mechanical thrombectomy is limited by two factors. First , only 10 % of patients with acute ischemic stroke have a proximal large-artery occlusion in the anterior circulation and present early enough to undergo mechanical thrombectomy within 6 h; an additional 9-10 % of patients presenting within the 6-24-h time window may also qualify for the procedure. Second , not all stroke centers have the resources or expertise to perform mechanical thrombectomy. Nonetheless , patients who present to hospitals where thrombectomy is not an option can receive intravenous t-PA , and those with qualifying anterior circulation strokes can then be transferred to tertiary stroke centers where thrombectomy is available. Therefore , despite the advances afforded by mechanical thrombectomy , there remains a need for treatments that improve the efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy. In this review , we discuss: ( i) current treatment options for acute ischemic stroke; ( ii) the mechanism of action of fibrinolytic agents; and ( iii) potential strategies to manipulate the fibrinolytic system to promote endogenous fibrinolysis or to enhance the efficacy of fibrinolytic therapy.
