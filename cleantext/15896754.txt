  Pulsatility seems to have a teleological role because evolutionary hierarchy favors higher ordered animals with more complex , multichamber circulatory systems that generate higher pulse pressure compared with lower ordered animals. Yet despite years of such natural selection , the modern generation of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices ( CF-LVADs) that have been increasingly used for the last decade have created a unique physiology characterized by a nonpulsatile , nonlaminar blood flow profile with the absence of the usual large elastic artery Windkessel effect during diastole. Although outcomes and durability have improved with CF-LVADs , patients supported with CF-LVADs have a high rate of complications that were not as frequently observed with older pulsatile devices , including gastrointestinal bleeding from arteriovenous malformations , pump thrombosis , and stroke. Given the apparent fundamental biological role of the pulse , the purpose of this review is to describe the normal physiology of ventricular-arterial coupling from pulsatile flow , the effects of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> on this physiology and the vasculature , and to examine the effects of nonpulsatile blood flow on the vascular system and potential role in complications seen with CF-LVAD therapy. Understanding these concomitant vascular changes with CF-LVADs may be a key step in improving patient outcomes as modulation of pulsatility and flow characteristics may serve as a novel , yet simple , therapy for reducing complications.
