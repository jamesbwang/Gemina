  The aim was to capture interdisciplinary expertise from a large group of clinicians , reflecting practice from across the UK and further , to inform subsequent development of a national consensus guidance for optimal management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( IIH). Between September 2015 and October 2017 , a specialist interest group including neurology , neurosurgery , neuroradiology , ophthalmology , nursing , primary care doctors and patient representatives met. An initial UK survey of attitudes and practice in IIH was sent to a wide group of physicians and surgeons who investigate and manage IIH regularly. A comprehensive systematic literature review was performed to assemble the foundations of the statements. An international panel along with four national professional bodies , namely the Association of British Neurologists , British Association for the Study of Headache , the Society of British Neurological Surgeons and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists critically reviewed the statements. Over 20 questions were constructed: one based on the diagnostic principles for optimal investigation of papilloedema and 21 for the management of IIH. Three main principles were identified: ( 1) to treat the underlying disease; ( 2) to protect the vision; and ( 3) to minimise the headache<symptom> morbidity. Statements presented provide insight to uncertainties in IIH where research opportunities exist. In collaboration with many different specialists , professions and patient representatives , we have developed guidance statements for the investigation and management of adult IIH.
