  Mixed-lineage leukemia<disease> ( MLL) with multifarious partner genes leads to aggressive leukemia<disease> with dismal outcomes. Using panel-based targeted sequencing , we examined 90 cases with MLL-rearranged ( MLL-r) childhood acute leukemia<disease> , including 55 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL) and 35 with acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML). MLL breakpoints and complete rearrangements were identified. A total of 37.8 % ( 34/90) of patients displayed a single direct MLL fusion gene , 15.6 % ( 14/90) carried a single reciprocal fusion , and 27.8 % ( 25/90) had both reciprocal MLL fusion alleles. The remaining 17 MLL-r cases exhibited complex translocations with homozygous disruptions on chromosome 11 or two breakpoints on the same MLL allele with a deletion of functional regions. A total of 77 patients ( 45 ALL and 32 AML) received chemotherapy with a median follow-up of 2.5 years. Unexpectedly , we identified children with reciprocal MLL fusions who exhibited relatively favorable outcomes compared with those in children with complex translocations or a single direct MLL fusion allele ( 66.1 % vs. 24.6 % and 27.6 % , P = 0.001). Reciprocal MLL fusion may be functionally rescued by a partially truncated MLL protein. Comprehensive MLL-r analysis by targeted next-generation sequencing can provide detailed molecular information and is helpful for precise stratified treatment and clinical prognosis determination.
