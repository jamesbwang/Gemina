  The Betulaceae family comprises two subfamilies , Betuloideae and Corylaceae. The subfamily Betuloideae contains two genera , Alnus Mill. and Betula L. Twenty putative long terminal repeat ( LTR) retrotransposons were mined from 171 scaffolds containing 5,208,995 bp of dwarf birch ( Betula nana) genome sequences. Five retrotransposons were finally selected after filtering the retrotransposon canonical features and nucleotide similarities between left and right LTR sequences. Of the five retroelements , three elements were found to be Ty1/Copia retrotransposons; identity of the other two elements could not be ascertained due to sequence undetermined 'N' bases in the sequence database. Inter-retrotranposon amplified polymorphism ( IRAP) analysis , based on the LTR sequences of the mined LTR-retrotransposons , produced 179 discernible IRAP bands among the Alnus and Betula genera. Sequence analysis revealed no size homoplasy among the homologous IRAP bands. Phylogenetic and principle coordinate analysis , based on the band sharing among the taxa , showed the species in two different genera were clearly separated. The subgenera in each genus of Alnus and Betula were also distinguishable from the IRAP profiles. In the genus Betula , the species in subgenus Betula showed mixed clustering between species. This is incongruent with the phylogeographical distribution of the species.
