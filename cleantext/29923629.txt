  With the increasing concerns regarding the toxic effects of bisphenol A ( BPA) , BPA has been gradually replaced by its analogues in the industrial applications , such as bisphenol S ( BPS). As comparative toxicity evaluation of bisphenol analogs is scarce , it is necessary to conduct the comparative analysis. In this study , the model animal Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> ( C. elegans<pathogen>) was used to evaluate low-concentration BPS toxicity , and 72-h exposure from L1 larvae was conducted. Multiple indicators at the physiological , biochemical and molecular levels were tested. At the physiological level , BPS exposure resulted in significantly negative effects above 1 µM , and head thrash was the most sensitive endpoint. At the biochemical level , BPS exposure induced no significant oxidative stress , but significantly increased apoptosis degrees only at 1 µM. At the molecular level , BPS exposure induced a small but significant variations in most stress-related genes expressions at all the doses. In addition , transgenic nematode TJ375 with green fluorescent protein ( GFP) based reporter hsp-16.2 was applied to show stress responses , but TJ375 was not sensitive towards BPS exposure. Compared to the effects of BPA in the previous study , the overall results proved that BPS was less noxious to C. elegans<pathogen> than BPA. The toxicity data of BPS could provide foundation to evaluate the comparative toxicity of BPA alternatives. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
