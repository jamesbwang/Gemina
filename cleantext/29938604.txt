  Exercise combined with adipose tissue lipolytic inhibition augments intramuscular lipid and glycogen use in type 2 diabetes patients. The present study investigates the impact of adipose tissue lipolytic inhibition during exercise on subsequent postprandial glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients. Fourteen male type 2 diabetes patients ( age 65 Â± 2 years , HbA Sixty minutes of endurance-type exercise ( at 45 % W Collectively , exercise with adipose tissue lipolytic inhibition reduces postprandial blood glucose and insulin excursions and , as such , further improves glycemic control in male type 2 diabetes patients.
