  Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) is a neuro-behavioral syndrome<disease> with a broad spectrum of different mechanisms and etiologies that are caused by abnormal brain development. To date , no highly reliable and effective diagnostic biomarker to assess ASD is available so far. The present study investigated the predictivity potential of some suggested markers in ASD diagnosis focusing onto the relative ratios of several plasma biomarkers of electron transport chain function , and mitochondrial metabolism in 41 patients with ASD evaluated for behavior deficits measured using Childhood Autism Rating Scales ( CARS). The control matched for further 41 healthy subjects. The relation of these relative ratios to ASD severity was also examined , as well as their ability to distinguish ASD children from neurotypical children. All predictive ratios were found to be markedly altered and correlated in ASD patients. However , no ratio was connected with autism severity. Interestingly , MRCC-I/caspase -7 , GSH/GST , and MRCC-I/COQ10 were the most distinctive relative ratios between neurotypical controls and ASD patients and may thereby be useful biomarkers for early diagnosis of ASD. Overall , this investigation proves that relative ratios of numerous mitochondrial biomarkers might be predictive and efficient to differentiate between neurotypical children and ASD.
