  Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists ( GLP-1 RAs) have been found efficacious in the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( T2D) , demonstrating the ability to lower HbA1c , and having the potential for inducing weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and reducing the risk of hypoglycemia , compared with other antihyperglycemic agents. Currently , 4 once-weekly ( OW) GLP-1 RAs are approved: albiglutide , dulaglutide , exenatide ER , and recently , semaglutide. This review compares the relative safety of OW GLP-1 RAs , as well as their safety in comparison to other antihyperglycemic agents , using safety data reported in key sponsor-led phase 3 studies of the 4 OW GLP-1 RAs. The favorable safety profiles of OW GLP-1 RAs , added to their efficacy and the favorable weekly dosing regimen , make these agents appropriate options for patients with T2D. However , there are key differences within this class of drugs in macrovascular , microvascular , gastrointestinal and injection-site reaction adverse events , and these should be considered when healthcare providers are prescribing therapy.
