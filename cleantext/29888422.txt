  The study determined the correlation between Irrational Parenthood Cognitions ( IPC) and marital quality by demographic variables in infertile women. A correlational study with a census method was conducted on all primary infertile women , who had a file in Zanjan , Iran. A 47 % significant positive correlation was showed between IPC and marital quality ( p < 0.001). The highest correlation was observed in the subsets of women aged 31-40 years , with high level of education , those at third socioeconomic classes , those with less than 10 years of married life , and women whose husband had no children from their previous marriage ( all ps < 0.05). Providing counseling services to women with primary infertility<symptom> , especially high-risk women may help to reduce IPC and to improve marital quality.
