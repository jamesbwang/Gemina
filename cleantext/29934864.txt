  Genome-wide association studies have shed light on the association between natural genetic variation and cardiovascular traits. However , linking a cardiovascular trait associated locus to a candidate gene or set of candidate genes for prioritization for follow-up mechanistic studies is all but straightforward. Genomic technologies based on next-generation sequencing technology nowadays offer multiple opportunities to dissect gene regulatory networks underlying genetic cardiovascular trait associations , thereby aiding in the identification of candidate genes at unprecedented scale. RNA sequencing in particular becomes a powerful tool when combined with genotyping to identify loci that modulate transcript abundance , known as expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTL) , or loci modulating transcript splicing known as splicing quantitative trait loci ( sQTL). Additionally , the allele-specific resolution of RNA-sequencing technology enables estimation of allelic imbalance , a state where the two alleles of a gene are expressed at a ratio differing from the expected 1:1 ratio. When multiple high-throughput approaches are combined with deep phenotyping in a single study , a comprehensive elucidation of the relationship between genotype and phenotype comes into view , an approach known as systems genetics. In this review , we cover key applications of systems genetics in the broad cardiovascular field.
