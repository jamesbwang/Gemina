  According to most studies , the incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome<disease> increases with age , with a peak incidence occurring between 70 and 80 years of age. The objective of this study is to describe the incidence ( overall and by sex and age group) and clinical characteristics of Guillain-Barré syndrome<disease> in Osona ( Barcelona , Spain). We performed a retrospective , descriptive , population-based study covering the period 2003 to 2016. The global incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome<disease> is 2.07 cases per 100,000 person-years. Incidence increases with age , except for small peaks during childhood and between 40 and 50 years , and reaches a maximum of 6.26 cases per 100,000 person-years above the age of 80. The incidences of the different variants were: AIDP , 72.1 %; AMAN , 16.3 %; ANSAN , 4.7 %; and Miller Fisher syndrome<disease> , 4.7 %. A total of 41.9 % of patients had a history of respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> , and 20.9 % had a history of gastrointestinal<disease> infections<disease> Protein in the cerebrospinal fluid was found in 76.7 %. EMG findings suggested demyelination in 73.7 % of the patients and axonal degeneration in 26.3 %. A total of 20.9 % of patients needed ventilatory support. Six-month mortality was 9.3 %. Variables associated with worse prognosis were age over 80 years , delay in admission , previous gastrointestinal<disease> infection<disease> , and AMAN variant. The incidence observed in our study is in the upper range of estimated incidence rates reported in European and North American studies. The syndrome<disease> may be underdiagnosed in elderly patients; physicians must be vigilant to the possibility of the disease , which is associated with a high mortality rate if it is not treated early.
