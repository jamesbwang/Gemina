  The lactic acid bacteria ( LAB) Leuconostoc<pathogen> citreum<pathogen> are non-sporulating hetero-fermentative bacteria that play an important role in the fermented food industry. In this study , for the enhanced and reliable production of recombinant proteins in L.<pathogen> citreum<pathogen> , we developed a bicistronic design ( BCD) expression system which includes a short leader peptide ( 1
