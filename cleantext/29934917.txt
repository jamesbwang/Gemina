  Fetal liver ( FL) is an intricate and highly vascularized hematopoietic organ , which can support the extensive expansion of hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs) without loss of stemness , as well as of the downstream lineages of HSCs. This powerful function of FL largely benefits from the niche ( or microenvironment) , which provides a residence for HSC expansion. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the FL niche consists of heterogeneous cell populations that associate with HSCs spatially and regulate HSCs functionally. At the molecular level , a complex of cell extrinsic and intrinsic signaling network within the FL niche cells maintains HSC expansion. Here , we summarize recent studies on the analysis of the FL HSCs and their niche , and specifically on the molecular regulatory network for HSC expansion. Based on these studies , we hypothesize a strategy to obtain a large number of functional HSCs via 3D reconstruction of FL organoid ex vivo for clinical treatment in the future.
