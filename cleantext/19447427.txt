  Radical cystectomy ( RC) is an effective but underused treatment for bladder cancer in elderly patients. This study performed analysis of propensity scores ( PSs) to determine the outcomes of RC for elderly patients , with results generalizable at the population-based level. We conducted a population-based , retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent RC in Taiwan during 2000-2010. Multivariable logistic regression was implemented to evaluate 30- and 90-day mortality and readmission rates , length of intensive care unit ( ICU) stay , length of hospital stay ( LOS) , and cost. Enrolled patients were divided into younger ( â‰¤ 75 years) and older groups ( > 75 years) who were matched according to their PSs. We identified 430 patients with bladder cancer who underwent RC between 2000 and 2010. Older age was not significantly associated with 30-day readmission ( odds ratio ( OR) = 0.80 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.38-1.70) , 90-day readmission ( OR = 1.10 , 95 % CI = 0.60-2.00) , 30-day mortality ( OR = 3.07 , 95 % CI = 0.31-30.0) , or 90-day mortality ( OR = 2.98 , 95 % CI = 0.91-9.70) in the PS-matched group. Similar trends were also observed for both groups regarding the mean length of ICU stay , LOS , and overall medical expenditure within the same admission. No significant differences existed between the older and younger groups for 30-and 90-day mortality and readmission rates , length of ICU stay , LOS , and medical expenditure in patients undergoing RC for bladder cancer. Some healthy elderly patients may be good candidates for this extensive curative treatment.
