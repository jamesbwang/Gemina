  Physical properties of primary cilia membranes<symptom> in living cells were examined using two independent , high-spatiotemporal-resolution approaches: fast tracking of single quantum dot-labeled G protein-coupled receptors and a novel two-photon super-resolution fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of protein ensemble. Both approaches demonstrated the cilium membrane to be partitioned into corralled domains spanning 274 ± 20 nm , within which the receptors are transiently confined for 0.71 ± 0.09 s. The mean membrane diffusion coefficient within the corrals ,
