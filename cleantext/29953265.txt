  Rhythms can be observed at all levels of the biologic integration in humans. The observation that a biological or physiological variable shows a circadian rhythm can be explained by several multifactorial systems including external ( exogenous) , internal ( endogenous) and psychobiological ( lifestyle) mechanisms. Our body clock can be synchronized with the environment by external factors , called `` synchronizers '' , i.e. the light-dark cycle , but it is also negatively influenced by some pathological conditions or factors , called `` chronodisruptors , '' i.e. aging or low physical activity ( PA). The desynchronization of a 24-h rhythm in a chronic manner has been recently defined `` chronodisruption '' or `` circadian disruption. '' A very large number of hormonal variables , such as adrenal and gonadal stress steroids , are governed by circadian rhythmicity. Such hormones , in normal conditions , show a peak in the first part of the day , while their typical diurnal fluctuations are totally out of sync in subjects affected by cancer or metabolic diseases , such as obesity , diabetes and metabolic syndrome<disease>. In general , a flatter slope with altered peaks in cortisol and testosterone circadian rhythms has been observed in pathological individuals. PA , specifically chronic exercise , seems to play a key role as synchronizer for the whole circadian system in such pathologies even if specific data on steroids circadian pattern are still sparse and contradictory. Recently , it has been proposed that low-intensity chronic PA could be an effective intervention to decrease morning cortisol levels in pathological subjects. The standardization of all confounding factors is needed to reach more clear evidence-based results.
