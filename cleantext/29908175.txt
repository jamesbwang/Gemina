  For young individuals ( < 40) without strong family histories that would put them at risk for genetic colorectal cancer syndromes<disease> , it is unclear if national Multi-Society Task Force surveillance recommendations apply or if endoscopists follow these guideline recommendations when such patients are incidentally found to have adenoma ( s) on colonoscopy. We reviewed records on young ( < 40-year-old) patients , with either no family history or only a `` moderate '' family history ( one first-degree family member with colorectal cancer at age ≥ 50) , who were found to have neoplastic polyp ( s) on their index colonoscopy. We assessed the pattern of endoscopist surveillance recommendations , whether endoscopist recommendations adhered to national guidelines , and compliance with surveillance recommendations. 141 subjects were included , of whom 19 ( 13.5 %) had a moderate family history of colorectal cancer. For patients with non-high-risk findings , 27.7 % were asked to repeat their colonoscopy in ≤ 3 years , and 99.0 % within 5 years. Endoscopist surveillance recommendation adherence rates to national guidelines were > 65.0 % for low-risk neoplasia , but lower for high-risk ( 40.0 %) , nonpolypoid ( 44.2 %) and serrated neoplasia ( 54.2 % , p < 0.001 for all). 96 % of subjects whose endoscopist recommendations were `` nonadherent '' to guidelines were recalled too early. Only 24.7 % of subjects were actually compliant with endoscopist surveillance recommendations. For young patients with neoplastic polyp ( s) but no strong family history , most endoscopists adhered to national guidelines and recommended repeat colonoscopy in 3 to 5 years. However , relatively few patients were compliant with repeat colonoscopy recommendations. For most cases that were `` nonadherent '' to guidelines , patients were recalled too early as opposed to too late.
