  Since 2009 , all eligible persons in England have been entitled to an NHS Health Check. Uncertainty remains about who attends , and the health-related impacts. To review quantitative evidence on coverage ( the proportion of eligible individuals who attend) , uptake ( proportion of invitees who attend) , and impact of NHS Health Checks. A systematic review and quantitative data synthesis. Included were studies or data reporting coverage or uptake and studies reporting any health-related impact that used an appropriate comparison group or before- and-after study design. Eleven databases and additional internet sources were searched to November 2016. Twenty-six observational studies and one additional dataset were included. Since 2013 , 45.6 % of eligible individuals have received a health check. Coverage is higher among older people , those with a family history of coronary heart disease , those living in the most deprived areas , and some ethnic minority groups. Just under half ( 48.2 %) of those invited have taken up the invitation. Data on uptake and impact ( especially regarding health-related behaviours) are limited. Uptake is higher in older people and females , but lower in those living in the most deprived areas. Attendance is associated with small increases in disease detection , decreases in modelled cardiovascular disease risk , and increased statin and antihypertensive prescribing. Published attendance , uptake , and prescribing rates are all lower than originally anticipated , and data on impact are limited , with very few studies reporting the effect of attendance on health-related behaviours. High-quality studies comparing matched attendees and non-attendees and health economic analyses are required.
