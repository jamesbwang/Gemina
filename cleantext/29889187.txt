  Bacteria , one of the most important causative agents of various plant diseases , secrete a set of effector proteins into the host plant cell to subvert the plant immune system. During infection cytoplasmic effectors are delivered to the host cytosol via a type III secretion system ( T3SS). After delivery into the plant cell , the effector ( s) targets the specific compartment ( s) to modulate host cell processes for survival and replication of the pathogen. Although there has been some research on the subcellular localization of effector proteins in the host cells to understand their function in pathogenicity by using fluorescent proteins , investigation of the dynamics of effectors directly injected from bacteria has been challenging due to the incompatibility between the T3SS and fluorescent proteins. Here , we describe our recent method of an optimized split superfolder green fluorescent protein system ( sfGFP
