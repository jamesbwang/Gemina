  Tumor heterogeneity within various cancer types including breast carcinoma is pivotal in the manifestations of tumor hallmarks. Tumor heterogeneity is seen as a common landscape where intra-tumoral components including cellular and non-cellular factors create interface with outside environment that lead to the unique identity of a specific cancer type. Among various contributors to tumor heterogeneity , cellular heterogeneity immensely plays a role in drug resistance and relapse of cancer. Within cellular heterogeneity of tumor , tumor-associated macrophages ( TAMs) are pro-tumor type of immune cells that promote growth , metastasis and drug resistance in breast carcinoma and other cancer types. Revealing the molecular aspects of TAMs can provide a breakthrough to remove therapeutics blockade to existing drugs and these understanding in future pave the way a new class of cancer immunotherapeutic. This review addresses current understanding on the role of TAMs in breast carcinoma hallmarks and clarifies the current scenario on pre-clinical drugs directed to tame pro-cancer TAMs.
