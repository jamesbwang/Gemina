  To determine the between-visit reliability of an accelerometer as a measure of lower-extremity impact acceleration at a variety of gait speeds in children. Absolute reliability assessment. Ten children with no known gait pathology attended two testing sessions , three weeks apart. A tri-axial accelerometer was fixed to the child 's distal tibia to measure peak positive acceleration responses while walking and running on the treadmill at three different speeds ( comfortable walking , threshold walking , and jogging). Reliability of the average and standard deviation Peak Positive Acceleration ( avgPPA and sdPPA , respectively) was calculated by intra-class correlation coefficients ( ICC) and Minimum Detectable Change ( MDC). Excellent reliability was indicated with ICC values for avgPPA of 0.90 , 0.95 , and 0.81 for comfortable walking , threshold walking , and jogging , respectively. Moderate reliability was found for the sdPPA measures. MDC values were calculated to be 18 % , 26 % , and 23 % for comfortable walking , threshold walking , and jogging , respectively , indicating the amount by which an avgPPA value would need to change to ensure that the change is greater than a measurement error. An accelerometer attached to the distal tibia is practical for use in a clinical environment to collect lower extremity acceleration data in children. Clinicians can utilise this technique for assessing a change following an intervention , such as biofeedback gait retraining.
