  To use radiofrequency ablation ( RFA) in the resection of C4 cervical chordoma with a giant paravertebral tumor mass to achieve tumor-free exposed margins and perform a gross total excision. A gross total excision using combined posterior and anterior approaches was performed. In the posterior stage , the C4 posterior arch was removed and the C4/C5 nerve roots and vertebral artery were released from the tumor. In the anterior stage , the giant soft mass of tumor from C3 to C6 was treated with RFA to make it shrink and solidify visually to achieve tumor-free exposed margins before resecting the tumor. Finally , a gross total excision was performed followed by the implantation of titanium plate and mesh filled with allograft bone. A gross total excision was performed with tumor-free exposed margins and radiotherapy. The patient survived more than 5 years without recurrence. RFA can help achieve tumor-free exposed margins. A gross total excision combined with RFA can improve the local relapse-free survival of patients with cervical chordoma. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.
