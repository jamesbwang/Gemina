  Achieving clear microscopic resection margins following pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD) is challenging particularly in borderline resectable pancreatic carcinoma ( BRPC). Positive resection margins has been identified as a major independent prognostic factor. Irreversible electroporation ( IRE) has emerged as a promising non-thermal ablative method that could be used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer as an adjunct to chemotherapy and surgery. This case report describes the successful simultaneous intraoperative IRE and PD in a patient with BRPC , achieving clear microscopic resection margins. Technical aspects and histology showing the effect of IRE are presented. The role of IRE in the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma should be further evaluated in prospective studies.
