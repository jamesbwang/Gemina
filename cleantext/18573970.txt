  Ischemic penile gangrene<disease> is an uncommon urologic condition associated with significant morbidity. Etiology of the disease is due to vasculogenic ischemia of the penile tissue. Presented are a series of images from a case of a 51-year-old morbidly obese male truck driver with idiopathic ischemic penile gangrene<disease>. The patient was evaluated with penile angiography and treated with urinary diversion via suprapubic catheter placement and serial debridement of the necrotic tissue.
