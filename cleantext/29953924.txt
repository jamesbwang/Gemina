  Many studies have reported that MTHFR C677T ( rs 1801133) polymorphism is associated with the risk of alcohol dependence ( AD). However , there are conflicting results regarding this relationship. In this article , we performed a meta-analysis of case-control studies to assess synthetically the influence of MTHFR C677T polymorphism on the risk of AD. All relevant studies were searched from Cochrane Library , EmBase , PubMed , and Web of science. 7 studies were included to evaluate the strength of associations between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and AD by pooled odds ratios ( ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). The present meta-analysis evaluated a total of 1066 AD patients and 1049 controls and showed that MTHFR C677T polymorphism was not significantly associated with AD susceptibility in all five genetic models ( Allelic , T vs C: OR = 1.04,95 % CI: 0.83-1.31 , P = 0.73; Homozygous , TT vs CC: OR = 0.98,95 % CI: 0.57-1.68 , P = 0.94; Heterozygous , TT vs CT: OR = 0.87,95 % CI: 0.64-1.19 , P = 0.39; Dominant , TT + CT vs CC: OR = 1.12,95 % CI: 0.92-1.35 , P = 0.26; Recessive , TT vs CT + CC: OR = 0.93,95 % CI: 0.58-1.47 , P = 0.74). On subgroup analysis by ethnicity , there was still insignificant association was detected in the Caucasians and Asians under the five genetic models respectively. In conclusion , the present data revealed that MTHFR C677T polymorphism may not be associated with AD susceptibility. Further well designed studies in a larger population and biological functional analysis of MTHFR are needed to elucidate the role of MTHFR C677T Gene polymorphism in AD.
