  Group face-to-face and individual internet-based mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ( MBCT and eMBCT) have been demonstrated to reduce psychological distress for distressed cancer patients in a randomized controlled trial ( RCT). This study focused on the long-term effects of this RCT during the nine-month follow-up period , and on possible predictors , moderators and working mechanisms. Distressed cancer patients ( n = 245) were randomized to MBCT or eMBCT. Data were collected at baseline , post-treatment , three- and nine-month follow-up. Data were analyzed with linear mixed effect models and ( hierarchical) linear regressions. Analyses revealed long-term reductions in psychological distress and rumination , and long-term increases in positive mental health and mental health-related quality of life ( QoL) in both interventions over the course of the nine-month follow-up. Interestingly , patients reported less psychological distress in the follow-up period after eMBCT in comparison to MBCT. Less psychological distress , rumination and neuroticism , and more extraversion and agreeableness at baseline predicted less psychological distress at the nine-month follow-up after both interventions. Less mindful and conscientious patients at baseline benefited more from eMBCT than from MBCT. Regarding working mechanisms , changes in mindfulness skills , fear of cancer recurrence and rumination during both interventions predicted less psychological distress at follow-up. Our findings suggest most improvements in cancer patients ' increase over time after both interventions. Furthermore , patients seemed to benefit more from eMBCT than MBCT based on psychological distress levels , especially those patients with low levels of mindfulness skills and conscientiousness.
