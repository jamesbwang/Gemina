  This project aimed to use education sessions and exercise classes to improve exercise self-efficacy in individuals with type 1 diabetes and in diabetes care providers ( DCPs). We recruited 12 adults with type 1 diabetes and 12 DCPs who participated in 4 weekly group sessions to learn about exercise physiology and to experience various exercise types. We provided participants who had type 1 diabetes with real-time continuous glucose monitors and heart rate monitors to enhance experiential learning. Both groups completed questionnaires before and after the study to assess confidence concerning exercise. Following the study , focus groups assessed the impact of the study on knowledge and self-efficacy. There was an improvement in DCPs ' attitudes toward exercise ( p = 0.004). DCPs ' confidence in providing clients with advice regarding the time , type and intensity of exercise ( p = 0.005) and strategies for overcoming barriers to exercise ( p = 0.016) improved significantly. We found no significant changes in results in the questionnaires of participants with type 1 diabetes. Focus group analysis suggested that the study improved awareness of the importance of exercise as well as knowledge about the effects of exercise in type 1 diabetes by both DCPs and participants. Continuous glucose monitor use alleviated fear of hypoglycemia by participants with type 1 diabetes. These findings suggest that a 4-week education- and exercise-focused program improves DCPs ' self-efficacy in providing exercise advice to patients. People with type 1 diabetes did not experience an improvement in exercise self-efficacy; however , the study supports the use of continuous glucose monitoring and the grouping of DCPs and individuals with type 1 diabetes to facilitate experiential learning.
