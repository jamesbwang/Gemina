  Facial nerve deficits cause significant functional and social consequences for those affected. Existing techniques for dynamic restoration of facial nerve function are imperfect and result in a wide variety of outcomes. Currently , there is no standard objective instrument for facial<symptom> movement<symptom> as it relates to restorative techniques. To determine what objective instruments of midface movement are used in outcome measurements for patients treated with dynamic methods for facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom>. Database searches from January 1970 to June 2017 were performed in PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Library , Web of Science , and Scopus. Only English-language articles on studies performed in humans were considered. The search terms used were ( `` Surgical Flaps '' ( Mesh) OR `` Nerve Transfer '' ( Mesh) OR `` nerve graft '' OR `` nerve grafts '') AND ( face ( mh) OR facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom> ( mh)) AND ( innervation ( sh)) OR ( `` Face '' ( Mesh) OR facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom> ( mh)) AND ( reanimation ( tiab)). Two independent reviewers evaluated the titles and abstracts of all articles and included those that reported objective outcomes of a surgical technique in at least 2 patients. The presence or absence of an objective instrument for evaluating outcomes of midface reanimation. Additional outcome measures were reproducibility of the test , reporting of symmetry , measurement of multiple variables , and test validity. Of 241 articles describing dynamic facial reanimation techniques , 49 ( 20.3 %) reported objective outcome measures for 1898 patients. Of those articles reporting objective measures , there were 29 different instruments , only 3 of which reported all outcome measures. Although instruments are available to objectively measure facial<symptom> movement<symptom> after reanimation techniques , most studies do not report objective outcomes. Of objective facial reanimation instruments , few are reproducible and able to measure symmetry and multiple data points. To accurately compare objective outcomes in facial reanimation , a reproducible , objective , and universally applied instrument is needed.
