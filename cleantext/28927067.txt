  Ovarian cancer ( OC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy , with a low 5-year survival rate. Most patients with ovarian cancer are diagnosed in late-stages. A rising number of non-coding RNAs ( ncRNAs) have been found to act as key regulators of gene expression by applying novel high-thought methods , such as next generation sequencing ( NGS). Non-coding RNAs not only play important roles in carcinogenesis , but also affect the clinical treatment strategies. One of the biggest challenge in OC treatment was chemoresistance , which causes poor prognosis and high recurrence rate after applying traditional remedies. Of note , it has been proved that ncRNAs were deeply correlated with chemoresistance in several cancers , which made ncRNAs considered to be potential therapeutic targets in ovarian cancer. Among of all ncRNAs , the studies of miRNAs and lncRNAs in ovarian cancer chemoresistance were much clearer. In this study , we reviewed the most relevant researches in this field , and described the relationships between ncRNAs and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.
