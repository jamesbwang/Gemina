  Recently , long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) were involved in promoting gastric cancer ( GC) initiation and progression. In the current study , we revealed that the expression level of LINC02163 was elevated in GC cell lines and tissues. Knockdown of LINC02163 inhibited GC cells growth and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanismly , LINC02163 exerted as a ceRNA and negatively regulated miR-593-3p expression. In addition , FOXK1 was identified as a down-stream target of miR-593-3p. The miR-593-3p/ FOXK1 axis mediated LINC02163 's effect on GC. To the best of our knowledge , our findings provided the first evidence that LINC02163 functioned as an oncogene in GC. LINC02163 may be a candidate prognostic biomarker and a target for new therapies in GC patients.
