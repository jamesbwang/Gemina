  The aim of this study was to propose a novel , comprehensive , macroscopic classification for bile duct lesions<symptom>. A two-stage protocol was designed. In Stage I , a retrospective study ( September 2013 to September 2015) of patients with bile duct lesions<symptom> detected by peroral cholangioscopy ( POCS) was performed. A total of 315 images with at least 6 months of follow-up were recorded , analyzed , and correlated to histology , and were classified as non-neoplastic ( one of three types , 1- 3) or neoplastic ( one of four types , 1- 4) based on morphological and vascular patterns. In Stage II , a prospective , nonrandomized , double-blind study was performed from December 2015 to December 2016 to validate the proposed classification. Sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive values ( PPV and NPV , respectively) , and positive and negative likelihood ratios ( LR + and LR- , respectively) were calculated ( gold standard: 6-month follow-up). Inter- and intraobserver agreement ( kappa value , κ) among experts and non-experts were calculated. 171 patients were included ( 65 retrospective; 106 prospective). In Stage I , 28/65 cases were neoplastic and 37/ 65 were non-neoplastic , according to the final diagnosis. In Stage II , 56/106 were neoplastic with a sensitivity , specificity , PPV , NPV , LR + , and LR- for neoplastic diagnosis of 96.3 % , 92.3 % , 92.9 % , 96 % , 12.52 , and 0.04 , respectively. The proposed classification presented high reproducibility among observers , for both neoplastic and subtypes categories. However , it was better for experts ( κ > 80 %) than non-experts ( κ 64.7 %- 81.9 %). The novel classification system could help physicians to distinguish non-neoplastic from neoplastic bile duct
