  Germinal centers ( GCs) are the primary sites of antibody affinity maturation , sites where B-cell antigen-receptor ( BCR) genes rapidly acquire mutations and are selected for increasing affinity for antigen. This process of hypermutation and affinity-driven selection results in the clonal expansion of B cells expressing mutated BCRs and acts to hone the antibody repertoire for greater avidity and specificity. Remarkably , whereas the process of affinity maturation has been confirmed in a number of laboratories , models for how affinity maturation in GCs operates are largely from studies of genetically restricted B-cell populations competing for a single hapten epitope. Much less is known about GC responses to complex antigens , which involve both inter- and intraclonal competition for many epitopes. In this review , we ( i) compare current methods for analysis of the GC B-cell repertoire , ( ii) describe recent studies of GC population dynamics in response to complex antigens , discussing how the observed repertoire changes support or depart from the standard model of clonal selection , and ( iii) speculate on the nature and potential importance of the large fraction of GC B cells that do not appear to interact with native antigen.
