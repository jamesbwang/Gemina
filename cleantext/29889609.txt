  The long-term management and prevention of Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> requires understanding of reproductive and sexual health behaviours , including mechanisms of partnered decision-making. In this article , we report on a qualitative study conducted before the arrival of Zika in Iquitos , Peru. We assessed existing patterns of reproductive decision-making among partnered men and women in a community under threat of Zika and discuss how these may impact Zika prevention in the long-term. We used a rapid qualitative assessment methodology , including in-depth semi-structured interviews with partnered women ( 28) and men ( 21). Deeply unequal gender role expectations limit discussion of reproductive decisions until after a first child is born. Women needed to perform a domestic ` of-the-house ' role to be considered suitable partners , leading them to hide their knowledge of sexual and reproductive health. Condoms symbolise risk and are unused with partners in committed relationships. A shared perception that men must take care of female partner 's sexual health , translates into male sexual and reproductive preferences overcoming female desires. Existing decision-making patterns lead to an increased risk of Zika exposure. Long-term response should expand Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> information and preventive messages to men and young people , in addition to engaging with broader societal challenges to gender inequity.
