  PACAP has opposing roles ranging from activation to inhibition of tumor growth and PACAP agonists/antagonists could be used in tumor therapy. In this study , the effect of PACAP stimulation on signaling pathways was investigated in MCF-7 human adenocarcinoma breast cancer cells. Results showed that MCF-7 cells express VPAC1 and VPAC2 , but not PAC1 , receptors. In addition , PACAP increased the phosphorylation levels of STAT1 , Src and Raf within seconds , confirming their involvement in early stages of PACAP signaling whereas maximal phosphorylation of AKT , ERK and p38 was reached 10 to 20 min later. Moreover , selective inhibition of Src or PI3K resulted in a significant decrease in the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT , but not p38 , demonstrating that PACAP signaling follows Src/Raf/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. On the other hand , selective inhibition of PLC or PKA resulted in a significant decrease in the phosphorylation of p38 , but not AKT or ERK , indicating that PACAP signaling also follows the PLC and PKA/cAMP pathways. Furthermore , PACAP induced ROS through H ₂ O ₂ production whereas pretreatment with NAC inhibitor decreased AKT and ERK phosphorylation , but not p38. Selective NOX2 inhibition affected Src/Raf/Erk and PI3K/Akt pathways , without affecting the p38/PLC/PKA pathway whereas other inhibitors ( ML171 , VAS2870) had no effect on PACAP induced ROS generation. On the other hand , PACAP induced calcium release , which was decreased by pretreatment with PLC inhibitor. Finally , PACAP stimulation promoted apoptosis by increasing Bax and decreasing Bcl2 expression. In conclusion , we demonstrated that PACAP signaling in MCF-7 cells follows the Src/Raf/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways and is VPAC1 dependent in a ROS dependent manner , whereas it follows PLC and PKA/cAMP pathways and is VPAC2 dependent through p38 MAP kinase activation involving calcium.
