  Serotonin syndrome<disease> ( SS) is a life-threatening condition , usually precipitated by a combination of serotonergic agents. Data regarding the incidence and management of SS in obstetrics are limited. This study presents a case of SS provoked by an atypical antipsychotic in a second trimester , singleton gestation , and reviews the management of SS in an obstetric patient. We present a case of a schizophreniform , pregnant patient with a singleton gestation admitted to a community , military hospital for serotonin syndrome<disease>. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit ( ICU) by the obstetrics team , where she was managed conservatively. The cornerstones of therapy were as follows: discontinuation of offending agent , intravenous fluids , supplemental oxygen , telemetry , and hourly neurological assessments. Fetal status was monitored daily. After stabilization , the patient was transferred from the ICU to inpatient psychiatry for continued care. Although serotonin syndrome<disease> is infrequently encountered in obstetrics , it is paramount that all obstetricians are familiar with its recognition and management , particularly in community hospital settings. The low incidence of reported SS is largely attributed to under-recognition , as the syndrome<disease> can mimic other more common obstetric diagnoses such as preeclampsia. Given the increasing prevalence of mental health disorders , it is essential for obstetricians to be aware of the potential for SS in our patient population.
