  Currently , there is only limited knowledge on the protein types and structures of the cottonseed proteins. In this work , water-soluble cottonseed proteins ( CSPw) and alkali-soluble cottonseed proteins ( CSPa) were sequentially extracted from defatted cottonseed meal. Proteins of the two fractions were separated by 4-20 % gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE); There were 7 and 12 polypeptide bands on SDS-PAGE of CSPa and CSPw , respectively. These individual bands were then excised from the gel and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. There were total 70 polypeptides identified from the proteins of the two cottonseed preparations , with molecular weights ranging from 10 to 381 kDa. While many proteins or their fragments were found in multiple bands , 18 proteins appeared only in one SDS-PAGE band ( 6 in CSPa , 12 in CSPw). Putative functions of these proteins include storage , transcription/translation , synthesis , energy metabolism , antimicrobial activity , and embryogenesis. Among the most abundant are legumin A ( 58 kDa) , legumin B ( 59 kDa) , vicilin C72 ( 70 kDa) , vicilin GC72-A ( 71 kDa) , and vicilin-like antimicrobial peptides ( 62 kDa). This work enriched the fundamental knowledge on cottonseed protein composition , and would help in better understanding of the functional and physicochemical properties of cottonseed protein and for enhancing its biotechnological utilization.
