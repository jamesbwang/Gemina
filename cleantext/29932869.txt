  Schwann cells actively interact with axons of dorsal root ganglia ( DRG) neurons. Exosomes mediate intercellular communication by transferring their biomaterials , including microRNAs ( miRs) into recipient cells. We hypothesized that exosomes derived from Schwann cells stimulated by high glucose ( HG) exosomes accelerate development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and that exosomal cargo miRs contribute to this process. We found that HG exosomes contained high levels of miR-28 , -31 a , and -130 a compared to exosomes derived from non-HG-stimulated Schwann cells. In vitro , treatment of distal axons with HG exosomes resulted in reduction of axonal growth , which was associated with elevation of miR-28 , -31 a , and -130 a and reduction of their target proteins of DNA methyltransferase-3Î± , NUMB ( an endocytic adaptor protein) , synaptosome associated protein 25 , and growth-associated protein-43 in axons. In vivo , administration of HG exosomes to sciatic nerves of diabetic db/db mice at 7 wk of age promoted occurrence of peripheral neuropathy characterized by impairment of nerve conduction velocity and induction of mechanic and thermal hypoesthesia , which was associated with substantial decreases in intraepidermal nerve fibers. Our findings demonstrate a functional role of exosomes derived from HG-stimulated Schwann cells in mediating development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.-Jia , L. , Chopp , M. , Wang , L. , Lu , X. , Szalad , A. , Zhang , Z.
