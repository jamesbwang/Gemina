  We investigated the association of thiazolidinedione and its dose effect with the risk of Parkinson 's disease ( PD) in patients with diabetes mellitus ( DM). This study enrolled 38,521 patients with newly-diagnosed DM , between 2001 and 2013 , and compared them to the matched subjects without DM. The hazard ratios ( HRs) for PD were compared between the thiazolidinedione-treated and non-thiazolidinedione-treated groups of the study cohort , and between subgroups who received different cumulative dosages of thiazolidinedione. We observed that 544 ( 1.4 %) patients developed PD during the follow-up median duration of 6.2 years in patients with newly-diagnosed DM or had a higher risk for PD than patients without DM ( HR = 1.150). In the study cohort , the risk of PD was significantly lower in the thiazolidinedione-treated group ( HR = 0.399) compared to the non-thiazolidinedione-treated group. Thiazolidinedione reduced the risk of PD in a dose-dependent manner , with HRs ranging from 0.613 to 0.081 with defined daily doses of 0-90 to > 720 , respectively. Thiazolidinedione use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of PD in patients with newly-diagnosed DM. Further studies to elucidate the common mechanism of PD and DM may provide novel therapies for these two diseases. Key messages Newly-diagnosed diabetes mellitus slightly increases the risk for Parkinson 's disease. Thiazolidinedione is associated with a lower risk of Parkinson 's disease in a dose-dependent manner in patients with newly-diagnosed diabetes mellitus.
