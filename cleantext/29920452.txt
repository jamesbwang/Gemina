  Sudden cardiac death in the young ( SCDY) spans gender , race , ethnicity , and socioeconomic class. The loss of any pediatric patient is a matter of national and international public health concern , and focused efforts should be aimed at preventing these burdensome tragedies. Prepared by members of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium , this White Paper summarizes and reports the dialogue at the second Think Tank related to the issues and the proposed solutions for the development of a national resource for screening and prevention of SCDY. This Think Tank , sponsored by the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium and the United States Food and Drug Administration , convened on February 18 , 2016 , in Miami , FL , to identify and resolve the barriers that prevent early identification of patients at risk for SCDY. All potential stakeholders including national and international experts from industry , medicine , academics , engineering , and community advocacy leaders had an opportunity to share ideas and collaborate.
