  This study aimed to evaluate the difference and consistency between single-photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography ( SPECT-CT) and MRI in diagnosing osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures ( OVCFs) and identifying active lesions<symptom>. All 46 patients underwent SPECT-CT and MRI examinations. The pain vertebral body and pain sites were determined using both MRI and SPECT-CT during percutaneous kyphoplasty ( PKP). The differences before and after treatment were assessed using visual analog scale scores and evaluated using a paired t-test. Furthermore , the difference and conformity of SPECT-CT and MRI in diagnosing OVCFs were determined using the McNemar test and the κ-statistic , and by calculating the accuracy index of SPECT-CT diagnosis. Among all 46 patients , MRI showed 79 segments that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for fresh OVCFs , whereas SPECT-CT showed 83 segments , and a total of 77 affected vertebral bodies were treated with PKP. Paired t-test evaluation showed that PKP was effective , suggesting that the affected sites were determined accurately ( P < 0.05). Furthermore , the κ-statistics indicated that these two methods were highly consistent ( P < 0.05) and the McNemar test indicated that the efficacy of these two diagnostic methods was closely correlated ( P > 0.05). In different stages of fractures , especially the acute phase , the consistency of SPECT-CT and MRI in the diagnosis of fresh OVCFs was high. SPECT-CT is the preferred method for imaging diagnosis when patients with suspected OVCFs have contraindications to MRI , particularly for patients with acute fractures.
