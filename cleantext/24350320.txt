  There are few proven strategies to reduce the frequency of potentially preventable hospitalizations and Emergency Department ( ED) visits. To facilitate strategy development , we documented these events among complex patients and the factors that contribute to them in a large care-improvement initiative. Observational study with retrospective audits and selective interviews by the patients ' care managers among 12 diverse medical groups in California , Minnesota , Pennsylvania , and Washington that participated in an initiative to implement collaborative care for patients with both depression<symptom> and either uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , or both. We reviewed information about 373 adult patients with the required conditions who belonged to these medical groups and had experienced 389 hospitalizations or ED visits during the 12-month study period from March 30 , 2014 , through March 29 , 2015. The main outcome measures were potentially preventable hospitalizations or ED visit events. Of the studied events , 28 % were considered to be potentially preventable ( 39 % of ED visits and 14 % of hospitalizations) and 4.6 % of patients had 40 % of events. Only type of insurance coverage; patient lack of resources , caretakers , or understanding of care; and inability to access clinic care were more frequent in those with potentially preventable events. Neither disease control nor ambulatory care-sensitive conditions were associated with potentially preventable events. Among these complex patients , patient characteristics , disease control , and the presence of ambulatory care-sensitive conditions were not associated with likelihood of ED visits or hospital admissions , including those considered to be potentially preventable. The current focus on using ambulatory care-sensitive conditions as a proxy for potentially preventable events needs further evaluation.
