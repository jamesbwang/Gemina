  Survival alone is no longer an adequate outcome for persons with brain tumors; the quality of the survivorship experience should be viewed with equal importance. Symptom management is a significant component of quality survivorship care. Regardless of their histology , brain tumors and therapies used to treat them produce symptoms that affect an individual 's ability to function in everyday life. Common symptoms include fatigue<symptom> , cognitive impairment , distress , and sleep disturbance. Symptom-based interventions for persons with brain tumors focus on prevention , self-management and prescriptive interventions targeted to these problems. Unfortunately , little evidence exists to support many interventions , making it challenging for clinicians to provide concrete recommendations. Research is needed to provide evidence in support of symptom-based interventions while novel approaches to these challenging problems are developed.
