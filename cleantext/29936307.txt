  Nontuberculous mycobacteria ( NTM) are ubiquitous in the environment and human exposure is likely to be pervasive; yet , the occurrence of NTM-related diseases is relatively infrequent. This discrepancy suggests that host risk factors play an integral role in vulnerability to NTM infections. Isolated NTM lung disease ( NTM-LD) is often due to underlying anatomical pulmonary or immune disorders , either of which may be acquired or genetic. However , many cases of NTM-LD have no known underlying risk factors and may be multigenic and/or multicausative. In contrast , extrapulmonary visceral or disseminated NTM diseases almost always have an underlying severe immunodeficiency , which may also be acquired or genetic. NTM cell wall components play a key role in pathogenesis and as inducers of the host immune response.
