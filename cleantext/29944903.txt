  Studies suggest that leukocyte telomere length is an index of systemic ageing. Here , we discuss telomere length as a marker of biological ageing in relation to residential landscape ( greenness) , residential air pollution and work-related exposures. Telomere lengths are memories of cumulative oxidative and inflammatory stress , and show to have inverse associations with the risk of non-communicable diseases. For this reason , telomeres are considered as markers of biological ageing. Studies at birth , in children , young adulthood , and elderly show that residential green space , lower traffic exposure and long-term lower exposure to particulate air pollution are associated with longer telomeres. Work-related exposures including exposure to toxic metals , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and particulate matter are associated with shorter telomeres for a given age. In contrast to chronic exposures , evidence is present of the observation that recent exposure is associated with longer telomeres. Our overview shows that the magnitude of residential and work-related environmental factors on telomere length are often as important as many classical lifestyle factors.
