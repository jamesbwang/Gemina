  This population-based cohort study examined the relationship between level of continuity of primary care and subsequent emergency department ( ED) visits for adults with ( n = 66,484) and without intellectual and developmental disabilities ( IDD) ( n = 2,760,670). Individuals with IDD were more likely than individuals with no IDD to visit the ED ( 33.96 % versus 20.28 % , p < 0.0001). For both groups receiving greater continuity of primary care was associated with less ED use , but this relationship was more marked for adults with IDD. While continuity of primary care can reduce ED use for populations with and without IDD , it is a higher priority for individuals with IDD whose cognitive and adaptive impairments may complicate help-seeking , diagnosis , and treatment. Improving primary care can have far-reaching implications for this complex population.
