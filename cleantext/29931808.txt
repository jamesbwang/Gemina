  Claspin was discovered as a Chk1-interacting protein necessary for Chk1 phosphorylation and activation by the upstream kinase , ATR , in response to DNA synthesis inhibition in Xenopus oocyte extracts. Subsequent investigations have defined a molecular model in which Claspin acts as an adaptor or scaffold protein to facilitate activation of Chk1 by ATR within a multiprotein complex that forms on single-stranded DNA at stalled replication forks and sites of DNA damage. Interestingly , Claspin is an unstable protein whose degradation via the proteasome is tightly regulated via ubiquitination and controlled by multiple ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases. As a result , Claspin levels fluctuate during the cell cycle , contributing to the regulation of checkpoint proficiency and playing a key role in terminating checkpoint-mediated cell cycle arrest. In addition to its role in signalling genotoxic stress , Claspin is required to maintain normal rates of replication fork progression during unperturbed DNA replication and may contribute to the regulation of replication origin firing. Consistent with this , Claspin can bind directly to DNA , with particular affinity for branched or forked molecules , and it interacts with multiple protein components of the replisome. As expected for a protein with key roles in checkpoint signalling and genome duplication , aberrations of Claspin expression and structure have been observed in cancer. Claspin is furthermore targeted to facilitate viral replication and plays a role in suppressing cellular DNA synthesis in response to nongenotoxic endoplasmic reticulum stress. Here , we review the functions and regulation of Claspin with a focus on areas of active research.
