  Perceptions of peer food and beverage consumption norms may predict personal consumption. Yet actual peer norms may be misperceived. Data were collected from adolescents in grades 6-12 ( n = 5841) in 13 schools across six regionally diverse states via an anonymous online survey. The male and female averages for the number of sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSBs) personally consumed per day were significantly lower than average perceptions of the typical number of SSBs consumed by peers. Inversely , the male and female averages for the number of fruit and vegetable ( FV) servings personally consumed per day were significantly higher than average perceptions of typical FVs consumed by peers. Among the majority of male and female grade cohorts , the median SSB consumption was 1 drink per day and the median FV intake was 3 servings per day. Regression analyses found a strong relationship between personal consumption and perceived peer norms about male and female consumption ( β = 0.56 , p < .001 for perceived male norm among male students and β = 0.52 , p < .001 for perceived female norm among female students about SSB consumption , for example) , adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and actual consumption norms. Overall , 65 % and 67 % of students overestimated average SSB consumption among males and females in their grade cohort , respectively , while less than 5 % underestimated these norms. In addition , 49 % and 52 % of students underestimated average FV intake among males and females in their grade cohort , respectively , while only about 25-30 % overestimated the norm. There was little difference in male and female students ' estimations of peer norms. Unhealthy misperceptions of SSB norms and FV norms existed across all student categories and grade cohorts , which may contribute to unhealthy personal dietary patterns.
