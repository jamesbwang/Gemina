  SrTiO _ ( 3) exhibits a superconducting dome upon doping with Nb , with a maximum critical temperature T _ ( c) ≈ 0.4 K. Using microwave stripline resonators at frequencies from 2 to 23 GHz and temperatures down to 0.02 K , we probe the low-energy optical response of superconducting SrTiO _ ( 3) with a charge carrier concentration from 0.3 to 2.2 × 10 ^ ( 20) cm ^ ( -3) , covering the majority of the superconducting dome. We find single-gap electrodynamics even though several electronic bands are superconducting. This is explained by a single energy gap 2Δ due to gap homogenization over the Fermi surface consistent with the low level of defect scattering in Nb-doped SrTiO _ ( 3). Furthermore , we determine T _ ( c) , 2Δ , and the superfluid density as a function of charge carrier concentration , and all three quantities exhibit the characteristic dome shape.
