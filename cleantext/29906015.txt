  Store-and-forward teledermatology involves transmission of a patient 's images to a healthcare provider and subsequent response from the provider about the diagnosis or management. Furthermore , teledermatology in which mobile phones ( e.g. smartphones) are utilized for communication between the patient and their provider is referred to as mobile-teledermatology. In this study , we investigate the use of mobile-teledermatology in the management of actinic keratoses. We demonstrate that mobile-teledermatology may enhance communication between the patient and their provider when managing cutaneous<disease> disease<disease> and that even individuals in older age groups are highly satisfied with this type of follow up.
