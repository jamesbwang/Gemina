  Graphical representation of results are a central component of original research articles in sports medicine. There has been recent criticism in the scientific community of a heavy reliance on simple bar graphs and line graphs to illustrate results because they often fail to clearly represent the measures and changes to interventions of individual participants. This article aims to suggest alternatives to bar and line graphs , including those that emphasize the illustration of ( 1) individual subject measures and data set distribution , ( 2) magnitude of group differences , ( 3) the relationships between multiple variables , and ( 4) unique ways of displaying time series data.
