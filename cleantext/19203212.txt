  Honokiol is a natural compound with small molecular structure and extracted from bark of magnolia trees. The biological activities of honokiol include anti-oxidation , anti-inflammation as well as anti-tumor. However , their mechanism remains unknown. In this study , A549 cell line and EGFR-mutant cell line PC-9 with higher expression level of Lyn than A549 cells were used to assess the anti-tumor effects of honokiol. As shown in this study , honokiol is an effective drug on inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis depended on Lyn and EGFR signal pathway regulated by Lyn , and its efficacy is stronger in PC-9 cells than A549 cells. In addition , this anti-tumor effect in PC-9 cells was weakened by Lyn-knockdown. Taken together , this study indicated the mechanism of honokiol on lung adenocarcinoma and provides a possibility of honokiol as an effective anti-tumor medicine.
