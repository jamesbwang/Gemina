  We seeked for specific cerebellar contribution within the dorsal attentional network ( DAN) , using Independent Component Analysis ( ICA). ICA-based analysis was performed on brain resting-state functional images of 19 volunteers. We confirmed that DAN includes bilaterally: lobules VI-VII ( crus I) and VIIB-VIIIA , as previously reported by Region-Of-Interest ( ROI)- based functional connectivity studies. We also found that lobule IX ( tonsillae) , and as well as the superior and , likely , inferior colliculi. Also belong to DAN. The part of lobule IX in relation to DAN is located more caudally and laterally , and less extensive than the more rostral part of this lobule belonging to the default-mode network ( DMN). Rostral and caudal tonsillae partake in the DMN and DAN , respectively. The latter could subserve either eye movement<symptom> control in relation to the oculomotor parieto-frontal network , partially congruent with the DAN , or more cognitive functions due to functional reallocation within the DAN.
