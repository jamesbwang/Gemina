  The aim of the study was to evaluate the association of the body mass index ( BMI) with the clinical-pathological characteristics and the recurrence of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The cohort consisted of 208 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma diagnosed in 2003-2014 , in Buenos Aires , Argentina. The patients were grouped according to the BMI as follows: BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 ( low weight); BMI ≥ 18.5 and < 25 kg/m2 ( normal weight); BMI ≥ 25 and < 30 kg/m2 ( overweight); BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 ( obesity). Two experienced pathologists reviewed and cross-checked all pathology specimens to confirm diagnosis , tumor characteristics and extent of the disease. All patients were followed every 6 months for 2 years , and annually thereafter. Recurrences were searched by using diagnostic imaging and histological confi rmation when necessary. Regression analysis was applied to defi ne associations of BMI with clinical , pathological , and prognosis features of the disease. A 5-point increase in BMI was significantly associated with tumor size ( OR 1.21; 95 % CI 1.1-1.5; p = 0.01) and greater extranodal extension in cervical metastases ( OR 1.11; 95 % CI 1.06-1.21; p = 0.03). The analysis of prognostic variables showed no association between increase in BMI and risk of recurrence ( HR 1.11; 95 % CI 0.91-1.22). In conclusion , we found that BMI relates directly with tumor size and extranodal extension , but not with recurrence.
