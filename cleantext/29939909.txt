  Elevated neurokinin A ( NKA) levels are associated with poor prognosis in patients with small bowel neuroendocrine tumors. We hypothesized that patients with NKA levels that remain elevated despite treatment with surgical cytoreduction have a poor prognosis. Patients diagnosed with small bowel neuroendocrine tumors who underwent surgical cytoreduction at our institution were identified. Demographics , histopathologic characteristics , and biochemical data were collected. Patients were grouped by the trend of their NKA levels ( group 1 , continuously normal; group 2 , transiently elevated but normalized after therapy; group 3 , remained elevated despite therapy). Survival rates were calculated from the date of the patient 's first NKA level. Serial NKA values after surgical cytoreduction were monitored in 267 patients. Kaplan-Meier 2-year , 5-year , and 10-year survival rates were as follows: group 1 ( n = 157) , 97 % , 89 % , and 62 %; group 2 ( n = 78) , 99 % , 90 % , and 78 %; and group 3 ( n = 32) , 88 % , 69 % , and 0 %. Survival rates were statistically significant between groups 1 and 3 and between groups 2 and 3 ( P < 0.01). Serial monitoring of plasma NKA levels is useful in identifying patients who have a poor prognosis. Elevated NKA levels can indicate the need for immediate therapeutic intervention.
