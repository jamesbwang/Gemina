  Transforming growth factor & beta; ( TGF- & beta ;-RRB- signaling transduces immunosuppressive biochemical and mechanical signals in the tumor microenvironment. In addition to canonical SMAD transcription factor signaling , TGF- & beta; can promote tumor growth and survival by inhibiting proinflammatory signaling and extracellular matrix ( ECM) remodeling. In this article , we review how TGF- & beta; activated kinase 1 ( TAK1) activation lies at the intersection of proinflammatory signaling by immune receptors and anti-inflammatory signaling by TGF- & beta; receptors. Additionally , we discuss the role of TGF- & beta; in the mechanobiology of cancer. Understanding how TGF- & beta; dampens proinflammatory responses and induces pro-survival mechanical signals throughout cancer development is critical for designing therapeutics that inhibit tumor progression while bolstering the immune response.
