  One of the widespread problems of oral health is bruxism and is defined as a parafunctional habit with involuntary grinding and gnashing of the teeth occurring during sleep. However , bruxism is connected to anxiety<symptom> and stress , but the published literature on bruxism among prison inmates is scanty. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of active sleep bruxism and its impact on oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQoL) among inmates in Central Penal Institution , Mysore. The study was cross sectional and conducted among eligible male inmates at Central Penal Institution , Mysore. The information on active sleep bruxism and OHRQoL was collected using a predesigned structured questionnaire by means of personal interview by a trained investigator. The active sleep bruxism was assessed using the criteria of American Academy of Sleep Medicine and OHRQoL through modified oral health impact profile ( OHIP-14). The data analysis was done using descriptive statistics , Chi-square test , t-test , analysis of variance , and linear regression model. A total of 212 male inmates aged between 18 and 80 years were considered for the study. The prevalence of active sleep bruxism among the study population was 31.6 %. The mean OHIP-14 score was significantly higher ( P < 0.001) among the inmates having active sleep bruxism ( 38.52 ± 12.8) suggesting a high oral health impact as compared to inmates without this disorder ( 31.67 ± 12). The prevalence of active sleep bruxism was higher among the inmates of penal institution as compared to the general population. The active sleep bruxism had a negative impact on OHRQoL.
