  Wiki platform use has potential to improve student learning by improving engagement with course material. A student-created wiki was established to serve as a repository of study tools for students in a medical school curriculum. There is a scarcity of information describing student-led creation of wikis in medical education. The aim is to characterize website traffic of a student-created wiki and evaluate student perceptions of usage via a short anonymous online survey. Website analytics were used to track visitation statistics to the wiki and a survey was distributed to assess ease of use , interest in contributing to the wiki , and suggestions for improvement. Site traffic data indicated high usage , with a mean of 315 ( SD 241) pageviews per day from July 2011 to March 2013 and 74,317 total user sessions. The mean session duration was 1.94 ( SD 1.39) minutes. Comparing Fall 2011 to Fall 2012 sessions revealed a large increase in returning visitors ( from 12,397 to 20,544 , 65.7 %) and sessions via mobile devices ( 831 to 1560 , 87.7 %). The survey received 164 responses; 88.0 % ( 162/184) were aware of the wiki at the time of the survey. On average , respondents felt that the wiki was more useful in the preclinical years ( mean 2.73 , SD 1.25) than in the clinical years ( mean 1.88 , SD 1.12; P < .001). Perceived usefulness correlated with the percent of studying for which the respondent used electronic resources ( Spearman ρ = .414 , P < .001). Overall , the wiki was a highly utilized , although informal , part of the curriculum with much room for improvement and future exploration.
