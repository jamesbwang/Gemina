  MolArt fills the gap between sequence and structure visualization by providing a light-weight , interactive environment enabling exploration of sequence annotations in the context of available experimental or predicted protein structures. Provided a UniProt ID , MolArt downloads and displays sequence annotations , sequence-structure mapping and relevant structures. The sequence and structure views are interlinked , enabling sequence annotations being color overlaid over the mapped structures , thus providing an enhanced understanding and interpretation of the available molecular data. MolArt is released under the Apache 2 license and is available at https://github.com/davidhoksza/MolArt. The project web page https://davidhoksza.github.io/MolArt/ features examples and applications of the tool. Supplementary Data are available at Bioinformatics online.
