  We tested the amyloid fibril formation inhibitory effect of seven teas diluted in 55 % ethanol at pH 7.0 at a protein concentration of 0.15 mg/ml Î±-chymotrypsin. In the experiments we investigated the formation and inhibition of amyloid fibrils by turbidity measurements , aggregation kinetics experiments and Congo red binding assay. The results suggest that the different teas effectively inhibit the formation of amyloidlike fibrils. The two most potent inhibitors were peppermint and melilot , extracts which almost completely inhibited the formation of aggregates in 5-fold dilution. The inhibitory effect on the aggregation formation of melilot and peppermint extracts was concentration dependant. The extent of inhibition was found to be proportional with the total concentration of phenolic compounds.
