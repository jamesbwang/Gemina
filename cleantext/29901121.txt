  Long noncoding RNA AFAP1‑AS1 has been shown to promote tumor progression in several human cancer types , such as thyroid cancer , tongue squamous cell carcinoma and lung cancer. However , the role of AFAP1‑AS1 in osteosarcoma ( OS) has not been investigated. In the present study , the expression of AFAP1‑AS1 was significantly upregulated in OS tissues and cell lines. Moreover , AFAP1‑AS1 expression was negatively correlated with OS patient prognosis. Besides , AFAP1‑AS1 knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of OS cells in vitro. Furthermore , in vivo xenograft experiments indicated that AFAP1‑AS1 depletion delayed tumor growth. Regarding the underlying mechanism , AFAP1‑AS1 served as a sponge to repress the level of microRNA ( miR) 4695‑5p , which targeted transcription factor ( TCF) 4 , a pivot effector of Wnt/β catenin signaling pathway. It was demonstrated that overexpression of AFAP1‑AS1 inhibited the expression of miR‑4695‑5p , while miR‑4695‑5p overexpression decreased TCF4 expression and reduced activation of Wnt/β catenin pathway. Through rescue assays , it was demonstrated that restoration of TCF4 expression reversed the effects of AFAP1‑AS1 knockdown or miR‑4695‑5p overexpression on OS cells. Taken together , these findings demonstrated that the AFAP1‑AS1/ miR‑4695‑5p/ TCF4‑β‑catenin axis played an important role in OS progression.
