  Certain cellular components of the eye , such as neural retina , are unable to regenerate and replicate after destructive inflammation<symptom>. Ocular immune privilege provides the eye with immune protection against intraocular inflammation<symptom> in order to minimize the risk to vision integrity. The eye and immune system use strategies to maintain the ocular immune privilege by regulating the innate and adaptive immune response , which includes immunological ignorance , peripheral tolerance to eye-derived antigens , and intraocular immunosuppressive microenvironment. In this review , we summarize current knowledge regarding the molecular mechanism responsible for the development and maintenance of ocular immune privilege via regulatory T cells ( Tregs) , which are generated by the anterior chamber-associated immune deviation ( ACAID) , and ocular resident cells including corneal endothelial ( CE) cells , ocular pigment epithelial ( PE) cells , and aqueous humor. Furthermore , we examined the therapeutic potential of Tregs generated by RPE cells that express transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-
