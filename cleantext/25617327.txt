  Memory reminders can return a memory into an unstable state such that it will decay unless actively restabilized into long-term memory through reconsolidation. Exposure to a memory reminder , however , does not always lead to destabilization. The ` trace dominance ' principle posits that the extent of exposure to memory reminders governs memory susceptibility to disruption. Here , we provide a first systematic investigation of reminder duration effects on threat memory modification in humans. Reminder duration was parametrically varied across 155 participants in a three-day protocol. We found that short reminders ( 1 s and 4 s) made the memory prone to interference from post-retrieval extinction , suggesting that the memory had been updated. In contrast , no reminder or long reminders ( 30 s and 3 min) made the memory resistant to such interference , and robustly return. Reminder duration therefore influences memory stability and may be a critical determinant of therapeutic efficacy.
