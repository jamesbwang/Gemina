  The aim of this systematic review was to compare outcomes between surgical and non-surgical treatment of actinic cheilitis ( AC). A systematic review and meta-analysis based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline was performed. A search of PubMed/MEDLINE , Web of Science , and Cochrane Library databases was conducted. Articles were selected based on the inclusion criteria: randomized clinical trials , prospective/retrospective studies , and case series with at least 10 patients , with a minimum follow-up period of 6 months. A Weighted Remission Rate ( RER) and Recurrence Rate ( RR) with a 95 % confidence interval was performed. Data analysis was performed using a comprehensive meta-analysis software. A total of 283 ACs in 10 studies were included. About 2.5 % surgically treated cases underwent malignant transformation. The Weighted Remission Rate was higher for surgical ( 92.8 %) compared to non-surgical treatment ( 65.9 %). The Recurrence Rate was lower for surgical ( 8.4 %) compared to non-surgical treatment ( 19.2 %). In this systematic review , the surgical treatment was more favorable than non-surgical for AC. Meanwhile , further studies are needed that should maximize methodological standardization and have greater rigor of the data collection process. This article is protected by copyright.
