  Controlling the interactions between plant proteins and polysaccharides can lead to the development of novel electrostatic complexed structures that can give unique functionality. This in turn can broaden the diversity of applications that they may be suitable for. Overwhelmingly in the literature , work and reviews relating to coacervation have involved the use of animal proteins. However , with the increasing demand for plant-based protein alternatives by industry and consumers , a greater understanding of how they interact with polysaccharides is essential to control structure , functionality and applicability. This review discusses the factors governing the nature of protein polysaccharide interactions , their functional attributes and industrial applications with special attention given to plant proteins.
