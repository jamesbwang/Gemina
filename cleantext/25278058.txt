  The objective of this study was to assess the clinical significance of increased fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ( F-FDG) uptake on PET/CT in joints for evaluation of symptomatic osteoarthritis ( OA) and prediction of progression. In this prospective study , shoulder , hip , and knee joints were imaged in 65 patients undergoing routine F-FDG PET/CT imaging. Patients completed the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC) questionnaire to assess joint<symptom> pain<symptom> , stiffness , and physical function. Standardized uptake values ( SUVs) were measured in hip , knee , acromioclavicular ( AC) , and glenohumeral ( GH) joints. Scout PET/CT images were evaluated for OA using the Kellgren and Lawrence ( K/L) system. Patients were followed-up for 5 years to determine the progression of OA on the basis of follow-up imaging or surgical intervention. SUV of knee ( r = 0.309 , P = 0.0003) , hip ( r = 0.260 , P = 0.0027) , AC ( r = 0.186 , P = 0.0313) , and GH ( r = 0.191 , P = 0.0271) joints correlated with WOMAC overall scores. Furthermore , SUV of knee ( r = 0.410 , P < 0.0001) , hip ( r = 0.203 , P = 0.0199) , and AC ( r = 0.364 , P < 0.0001) joints correlated with K/L scores. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for SUV were 0.734 ( knee) , 0.678 ( hip) , 0.661 ( AC) , and 0.544 ( GH) for symptomatic OA detection based on WOMAC overall z-score greater or equal to 2. Compared with K/L score ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 0.798 , P = 0.5324) , age ( HR = 0.992 , P = 0.8978) , and WOMAC overall score ( HR = 1.089 , P = 0.1265) , only SUV ( HR = 5.653 , P = 0.0229) was an independent predictor of OA progression in the knees. F-FDG PET/CT may be helpful with localization of painful abnormalities in the inflamed regions of the joints , which could potentially be used to direct individualized treatment in moderate and severe OA. Furthermore , SUV measurement on F-FDG PET/CT could serve as an inflammation<symptom> activity index in the knees that may be predictive of outcomes and progression rate of OA.
