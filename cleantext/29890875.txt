  There has been increasing interest in dietary health promotion in the workplace. Although many previous studies have focused on dietary habits in specific occupations , variation between occupational groups requires clarification. The present study aimed to examine differences in food and nutrient intake between occupational groups , using detailed classification. A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the Japan Environment and Children 's Study. The study included 38,721 employed Japanese expectant fathers aged between 20 and 65 years. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Occupations were categorized into 11 categories according to the Japan Standard Occupational Classification. Analysis of variance and analysis of covariance were performed to compare dietary intake of occupational groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the differences in adherence to dietary recommendations across occupations. Dietary intake differed significantly between occupations. Specific dietary intake was observed in security and agricultural workers , who tended to exhibit higher consumption levels for numerous foods and nutrients. In addition , relative to other workers , security workers showed higher intake of dairy products and calcium , and agricultural workers consumed larger amounts of pickles and salt. The study categorized occupations into detailed categories using the Japan Standard Occupational Classification , which facilitated the clarification of overall dietary trends across occupations and identification of specific dietary characteristics in individual occupations. The findings could aid in workplace health promotion.
