  Tobacco hornworm ( Manduca sexta , THW) is a voracious pest of tomato and potato. StZFP2 is a Q-type C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor ( TF) that is induced upon wounding and infestation. Previous work has shown that Q-type C2H2 TFs are involved in stress responses and when over expressed , can enhance protection against drought , salinity or pathogen infection. Twelve transgenic lines ( S1-S12) were tested that over-express StZFP2. Feeding S6 or S8 to THW significantly lowered larval weight ( 21-37 %) as well as increased expression of StPIN2 in comparison to untransformed Kennebec. The increase in StPIN2 , a classic marker for insect defense in potato , is consistent with the decreases in larval weight gain.
