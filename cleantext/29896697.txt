  Studies focusing on the teratogenicity of a series of new chemicals that are produced in a daily basis represent an important focus in toxicological/pharmaceutical research , particularly due to the risks arising from occupational exposure of the subjects. However , the complex mating procedures , scheduling of treatments , requirements for trained personnel , and elevated costs of traditional teratological assays with mammals hamper this type of assessments. Accordingly , the use of Drosophila melanogaster as a model for teratological studies has received considerable attention. Here some general protocols about Drosophila exposure-at different stages of their life cycle-to any chemical with putative teratological activity are presented. Importantly , some details about D. melanogaster embryonic , larval , pupal , or adult endpoints , that can be used to assess teratogenicity using flies as a model organism , are presented.
