  The impression among the attending physicians at their Burn Centre is that the number of contact burns caused by glass-fronted stoves is increasing , particularly in the youngest group of patients. It is an interesting subgroup , as these injuries are preventable. The authors ' aim of this study was to find out whether the incidence of burns after contact with glass-fronted stoves has increased.The authors included all patients aged between 0 and 3.9 years who presented to the National Burn Centre during the period 2008-2015 with contact burn injuries caused by glass-fronted stoves. The change in incidence over time was calculated from national records and analyzed with simple linear regression.Fifty-six patients were included , of whom 20 were treated during the past 2 years of the study. Thirty-seven of the 56 were boys ( 66 %) , median ( 10-90 percentiles) age was 1.1 ( 0.7-2.5) years , percentage total body surface area burned was 0.6 % ( 0.1-2.0) , 12 were admitted for overnight stay in hospital , and seven needed operations. The incidence was 0.34/ 100 000 children-years during the first 2 years , and it was three times as high during the past 2 years. The increase in incidence was 0.24/ 100 000 children-years by each 2-year period ( P = .02). The authors ' results indicate that contact burns among children caused by glass-fronted stoves are increasing in Sweden. The authors propose that there should be a plan for their prevention put in place.
