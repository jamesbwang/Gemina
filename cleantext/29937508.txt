  The accelerating process of urbanization in China has led to considerable opportunities for the development of construction projects , however , environmental issues have become an important constraint on the implementation of these projects. To quantitatively describe the environmental management capabilities of such projects , this paper proposes a 2-dimensional Environmental Management Maturity Model of Construction Program ( EMMMCP) based on an analysis of existing projects , group management theory and a management maturity model. In this model , a synergetic process was included to compensate for the lack of consideration of synergies in previous studies , and it was involved in the construction of the first dimension , i.e. , the environmental management index system. The second dimension , i.e. , the maturity level of environment management , was then constructed by redefining the hierarchical characteristics of construction program ( CP) environmental management maturity. Additionally , a mathematical solution to this proposed model was derived via the Analytic Hierarchy Process ( AHP)- entropy approach. To verify the effectiveness and feasibility of this proposed model , a computational experiment was conducted , and the results show that this approach could not only measure the individual levels of different processes , but also achieve the most important objective of providing a reference for stakeholders when making decisions on the environmental management of construction program , which reflects this model is reasonable for evaluating the level of environmental management maturity in CP. To our knowledge , this paper is the first study to evaluate the environmental management maturity levels of CP , which would fill the gap between project program management and environmental management and provide a reference for relevant management personnel to enhance their environmental management capabilities.
