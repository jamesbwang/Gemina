  Light-chain amyloidosis is caused by deposition of immunoglobulin light chains within multiple organs , including the gastrointestinal ( GI) tract. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage<symptom> is a less frequent presentation. Endoscopic findings are nonspecific , and bleeding mucosal polyps are rare. We report a 59-year-old Hispanic woman with a history of gastric polyps who presented with recurrent GI hemorrhage<symptom> from mucosal polyps. She had periorbital purpura and macroglossia. Biopsy of the gastric polyp confirmed amyloid deposition. Bonemarrow biopsy revealed plasma cell myeloma. She was treated with endoscopic intervention and arterial embolization to control the bleeding , and with chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.
