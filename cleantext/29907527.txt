  Photoinhibition , or cell damage caused by excessively intense light is a major issue for the industrial use of cyanobacteria. To investigate the mechanism of responses to extreme high light intensity , gene expression analysis was performed using the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.. PCC 6803 ( PCC 6803) cultured under various light intensities. The culture profile data demonstrated that , in contrast to the slow cell growth observed under low light intensities ( 30 and 50 Î¼mol m
