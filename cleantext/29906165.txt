  The dispersion law for plasma oscillations in a two-dimensional electron gas in the hydrodynamic approximation interpolates between Ω ∝ sqrt ( q) and Ω ∝ q dependences as the wave vector q increases. As a result , downstream of a charged impurity in the presence of a uniform supersonic electric current flow , a wake pattern of induced charge density and potential is formed whose geometry is controlled by the Mach number M. For 1 < M ≤ sqrt ( 2) , the wake consists of transverse wave fronts confined within a sector , whose angle is given by the classic Mach condition. An additional wake of a larger angle resembling the Kelvin ship wake , and consisting of both transverse and diverging wave fronts , is found outside the Mach sector for M > sqrt ( 2). These wakes also trail an external charge , traveling supersonically , a fixed distance away from the electron gas.
