  During consumption of fruits , the breakdown of the fruit tissue due to oral processing ( chewing , mixing with saliva) may activate or increase the rate of endogenous enzyme activities via the disruption of the cell wall , cellular decompartmentalization , and particle size reduction allowing the enzymes to reach their substrates. The aim of this study was to investigate the activity of one such endogenous fruit enzyme ( pectin methylesterase ( PME) ( E.C. 3.1.1.11)) during in vitro oral processing of raw tomatoes and associated changes in viscosity and microstructure. Oral processing of tomatoes purees was examined in the presence of artificial saliva ( AS) at 37 Â°C. in vitro oral processing was followed using immunofluorescence microscopy , apparent viscosity measurements , spectrophotometric , and titrimetric techniques. The results demonstrated that PME had slight but significant activity in the tomato fruit during in vitro oral processing generating methanol as a function of oral processing time , which was further evidenced using immunolabeling techniques to detect methylated pectin epitopes. A significant shear-thinning behavior of the tomato puree was observed due to dilution and/or endogenous fruit enzyme activity. These results suggest that activity of other fruit enzymes , such as polygalacturonase , which catalyzed the depolymerization of unmethylated pectin chains , might have resulted in a decrease in viscosity , which compensated for the increased potential for gel formation ( if any) caused by PME. These interesting insights into the role of endogenous fruit enzymes might pave the way to the understanding of fruit viscosity modification occurring in the mouth<symptom> and help in rational design of new fruit-based products.
