  Overgeneral memory ( OGM) , difficulty in retrieving specific autobiographical memories , is a robust phenomenon related to the onset and course of depressive and posttraumatic stress disorders. Inhibitory mechanisms are theorized to underlie OGM; however , empirical support for this link is equivocal. The current study examines the differential roles of two aspects of inhibitory control in association with OGM: suppression of prepotent responses and resistance to proactive interference ( PI). Only resistance to PI was expected to be negatively related to OGM , whereby individuals with greater ability to resist PI would have reduced OGM. Participants ( n = 49) completed a self-report measure of depressive symptoms and engaged in two tasks aimed at assessing resistance to PI and suppression of prepotent responses. Participants also completed a task assessing overgeneral autobiographical memory. As hypothesized , resistance to PI , but not suppression of prepotent responses negatively predicted OGM above and beyond the influence of depressive symptoms. Because a double dissociation was not examined , we can not address the potential independence of the submechanisms of inhibitory control that we assessed. Results exemplify the differential associations of two components of inhibition and OGM , suggesting that resistance to PI , in particular , may contribute to the development and/or maintenance of OGM and associated depressive disorders. Directions for future research are discussed.
