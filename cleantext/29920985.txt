  Three molecular photosensitizers ( PSs) with carboxylic acid anchors for attachment to platinized titanium dioxide nanoparticles were studied for light-driven hydrogen production from a fully aqueous medium with ascorbic acid ( AA) as the sacrificial electron donor. Two zinc ( II) porphyrin ( ZnP)- based PSs were used to examine the effect of panchromatic sensitization on the photocatalytic H
