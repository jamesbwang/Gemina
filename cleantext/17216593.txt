  Diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA) is an acute and major life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Fluid resuscitation , insulin therapy , and electrolyte replacement are essential for DKA treatment. Rarely , life threatening allergic reactions might develop in a patient treated with insulin. If anaphylaxis develops after insulin , the DKA treatment options are restricted. A limited number of case reports have been reported in patients with severe anaphylactic reactions to human insulin who were then treated with synthetic insulin analogues. We present a case of a 45-year-old male patient with allergic reactions to human insulin. The patient was successfully treated with insulin aspart and hemodialysis.
