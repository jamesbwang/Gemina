  The paxillin and M2 macrophage are all involved in cell proliferation and tumor progression , and this study aims to explore the interaction between them in colon cancer and the role of paxillin in cancer progression. Expression of mRNAs and proteins was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) and Western blot , separately. Endogenous expression of genes was modulated by recombinant plasmids and cell transfection. The levels of cytokines were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). The cell viability , invasion and migration were detected using the MTT assay , the transwell assay and the wound-healing cell migration assay , respectively. A nude mouse model for human colon cancer was constructed for tumor orthotopic expression. Paxillin was up-regulated in tumor-associated macrophages ( TAMs). Paxillin was up-regulated in process of M2 macrophage polarization. M2 macrophage polarization was inhibited with paxillin suppressed. Down-regulated paxillin inhibited cell proliferation and invasion in colon cancer through suppressing M2 macrophage polarization. PI3k/Akt inhibitor repressed M2 macrophage polarization through down-regulating paxillin. PI3k/Akt inhibitor inhibited the function of the macrophage in promoting cell proliferation and invasion of colon cancer through down-regulating paxillin. Down-regulated paxillin in macrophages inhibited tumor growth of colon cancer. With the PI3K/AKT pathway inhibited , down-regulated paxillin suppressed colon cancer cell proliferation and invasion by inhibiting the M2 macrophage polarization , thereby restraining the tumor progression.
