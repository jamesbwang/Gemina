  Physical forces are transduced into chemical reactions , thereby ultimately making a large impact on the whole-animal level phenotypes such as homeostasis , development and behavior. To understand mechano-chemical transduction , mechanical input should be quantitatively delivered with controllable vibration properties ‚Åª frequency , amplitude and duration , and its chemical output should be noninvasively quantified in an unconstrained animal. However , such an experimental system has not been established so far. Here , we develop a noninvasive and unconstrained mechanochemical imaging microscopy. This microscopy enables us to evoke nano-scale nonlocalized vibrations with controllable vibration properties using a piezoelectric acoustic transducer system and quantify calcium response of a freely moving
