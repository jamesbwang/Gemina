  RNA interference ( RNAi) is an endogenous , sequence-specific gene silencing mechanism elicited by small RNA molecules. RNAi is a powerful reverse genetic tool , and is currently being utilized for managing insects and viruses. Widespread implementation of RNAi-based pest management strategies is currently hindered by inefficient and highly variable results when different insect species , strains , developmental stages , tissues , and genes are targeted. Mechanistic studies have shown that double-stranded ribonucleases ( dsRNases) , endosomal entrapment , deficient function of the core machinery , and inadequate immune stimulation contribute to limited RNAi efficiency. However , a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms limiting RNAi efficiency remains elusive. The recent advances in dsRNA stability in physiological tissues , dsRNA internalization into cells , the composition and function of the core RNAi machinery , as well as small-interfering RNA/double-stranded RNA amplification and spreading mechanisms are reviewed to establish a global understanding of the obstacles impeding wider understanding of RNAi mechanisms in insects.
