  Nonrestorative sleep ( NRS) is one of the cardinal symptoms of insomnia and can occur independent of other components of insomnia. Among the sleep disturbances , NRS has been little studied in the general population , even though this symptom plays an important role in several medical conditions associated with chronic inflammation<symptom> such as heart disease , fibromyalgia , and chronic<symptom> fatigue<symptom> syndrome<symptom> , as well as various sleep disorders. There is paucity in the literature about effective treatments for NRS. Ashwagandha ( Withania somnifera) has been demonstrated to reduce anxiety<symptom> and stress , allowing the body<symptom> to settle down and prepare for sleep. This study will be a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled interventional study in NRS population.The NRS participants are identified using Restorative Sleep Questionnaire-weekly version ( RSQ-W) questionnaire. Actigraphy and polysomnography are used for the objective assessment of sleep. The other assessments used are Hamilton Anxiety<symptom> Depression<symptom> Scale ( HADS) , World Health Organization Quality of Life ( WHOQOL) scales , and C-reactive protein. Routine blood and urine analyses will be conducted to assess the safety of treatment. Duration of study for each participant will be 50 days with `` day one '' for screening followed by randomization for the treatment. The duration for medicine/placebo intake shall be 42 days.Primary outcome will be to evaluate effect of daily supplement of ashwagandha extract compared with placebo in subjects with NRS at 6 weeks from baseline , as assessed by the total score of RSQ-W.
