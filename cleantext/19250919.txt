  Celiac disease is a chronic gluten-initiated autoimmune disorder that predominantly damages the mucosa of the small intestine in genetically-susceptible individuals. It affects a large and increasing number of the world & rsquo; s population. The diagnosis of this disease and monitoring the response of patients to the therapy , which is currently a life-long gluten-free diet , require the application of reliable , rapid , sensitive , selective , simple , and cost-effective analytical tools. Celiac disease biomarker detection in full blood , serum , or plasma offers a non-invasive way to do this and is well-suited to being the first step of diagnosis. Biosensors provide a novel and alternative way to perform conventional techniques in biomarker sensing , in which electrode material and architecture play important roles in achieving sensitive , selective , and stable detection. There are many opportunities to build and modify biosensor platforms using various materials and detection methods , and the aim of the present review is to summarize developments in this field.
