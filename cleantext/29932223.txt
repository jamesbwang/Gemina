  Lauroyltransferase gene ( lpxL) , Myristoyltransferase gene ( lpxM) and palmitoyltransferase gene ( crcA) of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> BL21 were independently disrupted by the insertional mutations. The knockout mutant of two transferase genes ( lpxL and crcA) produced lipid A with no lauric or palmitic acids and only a little amount of myristic acid. The mutant was susceptible to polymyxin B , but showed comparable growth with the wild-type strain at 30 Â°C. The palmitoyltransferase gene from E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( crcA) or Salmonella<pathogen> ( pagP) was amplified by PCR , cloned in pUC119 , and transferred into the double-knockout mutant by transformation. The transformant contained palmitic acid in the lipid A , and recovered resistance to polymyxin B. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that palmitic acid was linked to the hydroxyl group of 3-hydroxymyristic acid at C-2 position of proximal ( reducing-end) glucosamine. LPS from the double-knockout mutant showed reduced IL-6-inducing activity to macrophage-like line cells compared to that of the wild-type strain , and the activity was only slightly restored by the introduction of palmitic acid to the lipid A. These results suggested that the introduction of one palmitic acid was enough to recover the integrity of the outer membrane , but not enough for the stimulation of macrophages.
