  Investigation of membrane fluidity by metabolic functional imaging opens up a new and important area of translational research in type 1 diabetes mellitus , being a useful and sensitive biomarker for disease monitoring and treatment. We investigate here how data on membrane fluidity can be used for diabetes monitoring. We present a decision support system that distinguishes between healthy subjects , type 1 diabetes mellitus patients , and type 1 diabetes mellitus patients with complications. It leverages on dual channel data computed from the physical state of human red blood cells membranes<symptom> by means of features based on first- and second-order statistical measures as well as on rotation invariant co-occurrence local binary patterns. The experiments were carried out on a dataset of more than 1000 images belonging to 27 subjects. Our method shows a global accuracy of 100 % , outperforming also the state-of-the-art approach based on the glycosylated hemoglobin. The proposed recognition approach permits to achieve promising results.
