  This large-scale study cross-sectionally examined the periodontal status and prevalence of `` red complex '' bacteria ( Porphyromonas<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> , Treponema<pathogen> denticola<pathogen> , and Tannerella<pathogen> forsythia<pathogen> in Japanese adults. A total of 977 participants were enrolled in the study. Probing depth ( PD) , bleeding on probing ( BOP) , and bone crest level ( BCL) were recorded , and the presence of red complex bacteria in the saliva was examined using polymerase chain reaction. The mean BCL value and the percentage of sites with a PD ≥ 4 mm or the presence of BOP were significantly higher in older participants. The detection rates of P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> , T.<pathogen> denticola<pathogen> , and T.<pathogen> forsythia<pathogen> were 46.3 % , 76.4 % , and 61.1 % , respectively. The P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> detection rate significantly increased with age , while those of T.<pathogen> denticola<pathogen> and T.<pathogen> forsythia<pathogen> were comparably high for all age groups. A close correlation between P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> and the percentage of sites with PD ≥ 4 mm was indicated by nonlinear canonical correlation analysis. Current smokers exhibited a more advanced disease condition and a significantly higher P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> detection rate than non-smokers. In conclusion , periodontal condition worsens with age , and P.<pathogen> gingivalis<pathogen> appears to be the red complex bacterium<pathogen> most closely associated with
