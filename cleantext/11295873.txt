  The data presented in this article are related to the research article entitled `` Microembolism of single cortical arterioles can induce spreading depression<symptom> and ischemic injury; a potential trigger for migraine and related MRI lesions<symptom> '' ( Donmez-Demir et al. , 2018) ( 1). This article presents data showing that thrombosis of a small ascending cortical vein ( 25 µm) in the mouse may also trigger spreading depression<symptom> as does penetrating arteriole occlusion , although less frequently ( 22 % vs. 100 %).
