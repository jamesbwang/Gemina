  To investigate the relationship between metabolic glutamate receptor 7 gene ( GRM7) polymorphisms and the susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss ( NIHL) in Chinese Han occupational population. Using a nested case-control study with a 1 ∶ 1 matching , a total of 277 cases of contacting noise workers were selected from a cohort in a steel factory. According to the matching criteria: the same sex , the same type of work , the age difference ≤ 5 years , contact noise length ≤ 2 years , 277 controls were selected. The 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) of the GRM7 gene , rs3749380 , rs11928865 , rs9877154 , rs3828472 , rs9819783 , rs11920109 , rs1485175 and rs9826579 , were detected by SNPscanTMmethod. The 4 gene models , the additive model , dominant model , recessive model , codominant model , were constructed to explore the biological association with NIHL susceptibility. The possible diplotype of each subject was constructed using Phase 2. 0. 2 to analyze its relationship with NIHL. According to the layered cumulative noise exposure ( CNE) , the interactions between the influencing factor were analyzed. The relationship between the GRM7 gene and NIHL was analyzed by single factor and multivariate factors conditional logistic regression analysis. The comparison of general demographic characteristics between the hearing loss group and control group showed that smoking could increase the risk of developing NIHL by 2. 051 times ( 95 % CI 1. 456-2. 891 , P < 0. 001). No statistically significant difference was found in the analysis of GRM7 polymorphisms and the susceptibility to NIHL. Smoking may increase the risk of NIHL. The relationship between GRM7 polymorphisms and the susceptibility to NIHL has not been found in this study.
