  Randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) exist along a spectrum , from explanatory , designed to evaluate interventions under ideal conditions , to pragmatic , designed to reflect usual care. This study assessed the pragmaticism of RCTs of advanced therapeutics in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). A systematic review was conducted to identify RA RCTs comparing biologic or targeted synthetic therapy in combination with methotrexate , to placebo or any other DMARD ( s). Trials were rated using the PRECIS-2 ( PRagmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary-2) tool in 9 domains , each rated from 1 ( very explanatory) to 5 ( very pragmatic). Latent class and regression analyses examined the heterogeneity in PRECIS-2 scores and relationship to trial characteristics. 96 trials were included. Eligibility , follow-up , and flexibility of delivery of the intervention were rated as explanatory , with mean ( SD) PRECIS-2 scores of 2.0 ( 0.7) , 2.0 ( 1.1) , and 2.1 ( 0.7) , reflecting strict inclusion criteria , intensive follow-up and rigid protocols. Studies were rated as pragmatic in setting ( 3.6 ( 1.5)) as many were international , multi-centre trials , and in primary analysis ( 4.1 ( 1.3)) as most used intention-to-treat analyses. In latent class analyses , two groups were identified; the majority ( 74 %) were rated as explanatory for most domains assessed. These trials had larger sample sizes , were more likely to be industry-funded , and enrolled patients with higher DAS-28 and HAQ-DI scores , but were less likely to be at high risk of bias. RCTs of biologic DMARD treatment in combination with methotrexate for RA were rated as predominantly explanatory , which may affect the generalizability of trial results to clinical practice.
