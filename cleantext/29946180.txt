  Statins may reduce mortality from esophageal cancer by both reducing incidence but also improving prognosis. However , prior studies of statin use and mortality have reported conflicting results. We identified 7882 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC) and 3868 with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC) from the VA Central Cancer Registry diagnosed between 2002 and 2016. We identified prescriptions for statins that were filled before and after cancer diagnosis. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios ( HR) and 95 % CIs for mortality risk. We used a time-varying exposure to avoid immortal-time bias and a 3 month lag ( following patients from 3 months after cancer diagnosis) to reduce reverse causation. A sensitivity analysis was conducted varying the lag duration between date of cancer diagnosis and start of follow-up. Statin use after diagnosis was recorded in 27.4 % of EAC and 17.1 % of ESCC patients. In EAC patients , statin use after diagnosis was associated with a decreased risk of cancer specific ( HR , 0.79; 95 % CI 0.70-0.88) and all-cause mortality ( HR , 0.80; 95 % CI 0.74-0.86). Similarly , statin use after diagnosis of ESCC was associated with a decreased risk of cancer specific ( HR , 0.77; 95 % CI 0.63-0.92) and all-cause mortality ( HR , 0.83; 95 % CI 0.74-0.95). The inverse associations were attenuated towards the null with a 6-month lag. Post-diagnosis statin use was associated with reduced mortality in esophageal cancer patients; however , the effect may be partially due to reverse causality as patients with poor prognosis are unlikely to initiate statin therapy.
