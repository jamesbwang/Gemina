  The Ets-1 transcription factor plays an important role in various physiological and pathological processes. These diverse roles of Ets-1 are likely to depend on its interaction proteins. We have previously showed that Ets-1 interacted with DNA-dependent protein kinase ( DNA-PK) complex<pathogen> including its regulatory subunits , Ku70 and Ku86 and with poly ( ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( PARP-1). In this study , the binding domains for the interaction between Ets-1 and these proteins were reported. We demonstrated that the interaction of Ets-1 with DNA-PK was mediated through the Ku70 subunit and was mapped to the C-terminal region of Ets-1 and the C-terminal part of Ku70 including SAP domain. The interactive domains between Ets-1 and PARP-1 have been mapped to the C-terminal region of Ets-1 and the BRCA1 carboxy-terminal ( BRCT) domain of PARP-1. The results presented in this study may advance our understanding of the functional link between Ets-1 and its interaction partners , DNA-PK and PARP-1.
