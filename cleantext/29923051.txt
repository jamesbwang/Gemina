  The Indo-Gangetic Basin ( IGB) experiences one of the highest aerosol loading over the globe with pronounced inter-/ intra-seasonal variability. Four-year ( January 2011-December 2014) continuous MICROTOPS-II sun-photometer measurements at Varanasi , central Ganges valley<disease> , provide an opportunity to investigate the aerosol physical and optical properties and their variability. A large variation in aerosol optical depth ( AOD: from 0.23 to 1.89 , mean of 0.82 ± 0.31) and Ångström exponent ( AE: from 0.19 to 1.44 , mean of 0.96 ± 0.27) is observed , indicating a highly turbid atmospheric environment with significant heterogeneity in aerosol sources , types and optical properties. The highest seasonal means of both AOD and AE are observed in the post-monsoon ( October-November) season ( 0.95 ± 0.31 for AOD and 1.16 ± 0.14 for AE) followed by winter ( December , January , February; 0.97 ± 0.34 for AOD and 1.09 ± 0.20 for AE) and are mainly attributed to the accumulation of aerosols from urban and biomass/crop residue burning emissions within a shallow boundary layer. In contrast , during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons , the aerosols are mostly coming from natural origin ( desert and mineral dust) mixed with pollution in several cases. The spectral dependence of AE , the aerosol `` curvature '' effect and other graphical techniques are used for the identification of the aerosol types and their mixing processes in the atmosphere. Furthermore , the aerosol source-apportionment assessment using the weighted potential source contribution function ( WPSCF) analysis reveals the different aerosol types , emission sources and transport pathways.
