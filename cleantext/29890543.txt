  Prevalence of papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC) is increased in patients with acromegaly. We aimed to determine the protein expression of BRAF , RAS , RET , insulin like growth factor 1 ( IGF1) , Galectine 3 , CD56 in patients with PTC related acromegaly and to compare the extensity of these expressions with normal PTC patients and benign thyroid nodules<symptom>. We studied 313 patients with acromegaly followed in Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty , Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinic between 1998 and 2015. On the basis of availability of pathological specimen of thyroid tissues , thyroid samples of 13 patients from 19 with acromegaly related PTC ( APTC) , 20 normal PTC and 20 patients with multinodulary goiter ( MNG) were histopathologically evaluated. Protein expressions were determined via immunohistochemical staining in ex-vivo tumor samples and benign nodules<symptom>. The incidence of PTC in acromegaly patients were 6 % ( n = 19). Among patients with PTC , APTC and MNG , all the immunohistochemical protein expressions we have studied were higher in papillary thyroid cancer groups ( p < 0.01 , for all). Between PTC group without acromegaly and APTC , galectin 3 and IGF1 expression was significantly higher in acromegalic patients ( p < 0.01 for all) while RAS was predominantly higher in PTC patients without acromegaly ( p < 0.01). BRAF expression was not higher in PTC with acromegaly patients compared to PTC patients without acromegaly. Galectine 3 and IGF1 were expressed more intensively in APTC. These positive protein expressions may have more influence on determining malign nodules<symptom> among acromegaly patients.
