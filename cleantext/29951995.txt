  Due to difference in radiation sources ( electron beam from electron accelerator , gamma ray from Aerobic plate counts ( APC) as well as yeast and mold counts of non-irradiated samples were 7.12 log CFU/g and 6.62 log CFU/g , respectively. EB and GR reduced these by 2-3 log CFU/g. Lower dose rate ( 1 kGy/s) of EB was more effective for microbial reduction than higher dose rate ( 5 kGy/s). In contrast , higher dose rate ( 9 kGy/h) of GR efficiently decreased APC compared to lower dose rate ( 1.8 kGy/h). Higher EB and GR dose rates significantly decreased the capsanthin content and Hunter 's red color ( a Low EB ( kGy/s) and high GR ( kGy/h) dose rates are recommended for microbiological safety of RPP with negligible changes in color attributes visible to human eye , in contrast to the measured values. Thus , the study demonstrates that the influence of absorbed dose is dependent on the applied dose rates. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
