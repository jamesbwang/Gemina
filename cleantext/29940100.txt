  Protein prenylation involves the attachment of a hydrophobic isoprenoid moiety to the C-terminus of proteins. Several small GTPases , including members of the Ras and Rho subfamilies , require prenylation for their normal and pathological functions. Recent work has suggested that SmgGDS proteins regulate the prenylation of small GTPases in vivo. Using RhoA as a representative small GTPase , we directly test this hypothesis using biochemical assays and present a mechanism describing the mode of prenylation regulation. SmgGDS-607 completely inhibits RhoA prenylation catalyzed by protein geranylgeranyltransferase I ( GGTase-I) in an in vitro radiolabel incorporation assay. SmgGDS-607 inhibits prenylation by binding to and blocking access to the C-terminal tail of the small GTPase ( substrate sequestration mechanism) rather than via inhibition of the prenyltransferase activity. The reactivity of GGTase-I with RhoA is unaffected by addition of nucleotides. In contrast , the affinity of SmgGDS-607 for RhoA varies with the nucleotide bound to RhoA; SmgGDS-607 has a higher affinity for RhoA-GDP compared to RhoA-GTP. Consequently , the prenylation blocking function of SmgGDS-607 is regulated by the bound nucleotide. This work provides mechanistic insight into a novel pathway for the regulation of small GTPase protein prenylation by SmgGDS-607 and demonstrates that peptides are a good mimic for full-length proteins when measuring GGTase-I activity.
