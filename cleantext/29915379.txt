  Superoxide is a reactive oxygen species produced during aerobic metabolism in mitochondria and prokaryotes. It causes damage to lipids , proteins and DNA and is implicated in cancer , cardiovascular disease , neurodegenerative disorders and aging. As protection , cells express soluble superoxide dismutases , disproportionating superoxide to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Here , we describe a membrane-bound enzyme that directly oxidizes superoxide and funnels the sequestered electrons to ubiquinone in a diffusion-limited reaction. Experiments in proteoliposomes and inverted membranes<symptom> show that the protein is capable of efficiently quenching superoxide generated at the membrane in vitro. The 2.0 Ã… crystal structure shows an integral membrane di-heme cytochrome b poised for electron transfer from the P-side and proton uptake from the N-side. This suggests that the reaction is electrogenic and contributes to the membrane potential while also conserving energy by reducing the quinone pool. Based on this enzymatic activity , we propose that the enzyme family be denoted superoxide oxidase ( SOO).
