  In nature , arthropods have evolved to utilize a multiaperture vision system with a micro-optical structure which has advantages , such as compact size and wide-angle view , compared to that of a single-aperture vision system. In this paper , we present a multiaperture imaging system using a microlens array fabricated by a patterned-layer integrating soft lithography ( PLISL) process which is based on a molding technique that can transfer three-dimensional structures and a gold screening layer simultaneously. The imaging system consists of a microlens array , a lens-adjusting jig , and a conventional ( charge-coupled device) CCD image sensor. The microlens array has a light screening layer patterned among all the microlenses by the PLISL process to prevent light interference. The three-dimensionally printed jig adjusts the microlens array on the conventional CCD sensor for the focused image. The manufactured imaging system has a thin optic system and a large field-of-view of 100 degrees. The developed imaging system takes multiple images at once. To show its possible applications , multiple depth plane images were reconstructed based on the taken subimages with a single shot.
