  When observing an ostracism episode , observers may wish to know whether ostracism is justified or not. If ostracism appears unjustified , observers will likely blame the sources and sympathize with the target; if it appears justified , observers will likely blame and devalue the target. Here we introduce the `` social dissimilarity rule , '' which holds that observers base their moral judgments on dissimilarities between the members of the observed group. In five studies , participants either recalled observed ostracism episodes or observed group interactions in which one group member was ostracized ( e.g. , in a chat or a group-working task). Results show that if similar persons exclude a dissimilar target ( target is an `` odd-one-out '') , observers attribute ostracism to malicious motives of the ostracizers , such as ingroup favoritism , and devalue the ostracizers. However , if ostracism can not be explained by social dissimilarity between the sources and the target , observers assume that the target is being punished for a norm deviation ( punitive motive) and devalue the target. Use of the social dissimilarity rule was neither moderated by cognitive load ( Study 3) nor by the perceived essentiality of the group distinction ( Study 4). But if participants knew that the target previously deviated from a norm , knowledge about the situation had a stronger effect on moral judgments ( Study 5) than social dissimilarity. These findings further our understanding of how observers make moral judgments about ostracism , which is important given that an observer 's moral judgment can strongly impact bystander behavior and thus target recovery and well-being.
