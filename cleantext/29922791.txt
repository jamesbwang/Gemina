  Three copper-based ligand-originated MOF isomers ( ZJNU-81 , ZJNU-82 and ZJNU-83) derived from methyl-functionalized V-shaped diisophthalate ligands were solvothermally synthesized and structurally characterized. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the position of the methyl group in the central phenyl spacer of diisophthalate ligands exerted a significant effect on determining the final structures of the resulting MOFs , which was rationalized to result from the steric effect imposed by the methyl group controlling the conformational structures of the ligands during the self-assembly process. Furthermore , their gas adsorption properties with respect to C2H2 , CO2 , and CH4 were systematically investigated and comparatively analyzed. Gratifyingly , the three MOFs exhibited respectable C2H2 and CO2 uptake capacities as well as impressive C2H2/CH4 and CO2/CH4 adsorption selectivities. Although the disparity is small , the different gas uptake capacities and adsorption selectivities exhibited by the three MOFs demonstrate that the position of the methyl group has a certain impact on gas adsorption properties. This work not only reported three MOFs with promising potential for C2H2/CH4 and CO2/CH4 separations , but also more importantly afforded a fundamental understanding of the positional effect of functional groups on the structures and gas adsorption properties of the resulting MOFs , which provides valuable guidance for future design and synthesis of porous MOFs displaying better performance.
