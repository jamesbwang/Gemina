  Citrus pomace is a huge agro-food industrial waste mostly composed of peels and traditionally used as compost or animal feed. Owing to its high content of compounds beneficial to humans ( e.g. , flavonoids , phenol-like acids , and terpenoids) , citrus waste is increasingly used to produce valuable supplements , fragrance , or antimicrobials. However , such processes require sustainable and efficient extraction strategies by solvent-free techniques for environmentally-friendly good practices. In this work , we evaluated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of water extracts of three citrus peels ( orange , lemon , and citron) against ten different sanitary relevant bacteria. Both conventional extraction methods using hot water ( HWE) and microwave-assisted extraction ( MAE) were used. Even though no extract fully inhibited the growth of the target bacteria , these latter ( mostly pseudomonads) showed a significant reduction in biofilm biomass. The most active extracts were obtained from orange and lemon peel by using MAE at 100 & deg; C for 8 min. These results showed that citrus peel water infusions by MAE may reduce biofilm formation possibly enhancing the susceptibility of sanitary-related bacteria to disinfection procedures.
