  The generation of cellular heterogeneity is an essential feature of immune responses. Understanding the heritability and asymmetry of phenotypic changes throughout this process requires determination of clonal-level contributions to fate selection. Evaluating intraclonal and interclonal heterogeneity and the influence of distinct fate determinants in large numbers of cell lineages , however , is usually laborious , requiring familial tracing and fate mapping. In this study , we introduce a novel , accessible , high-throughput method for measuring familial fate changes with accompanying statistical tools for testing hypotheses. The method combines multiplexing of division tracking dyes with detection of phenotypic markers to reveal clonal lineage properties. We illustrate the method by studying in vitro-activated mouse CD8
