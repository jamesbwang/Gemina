  Despite more effective chemotherapy combined with limb-salvage surgery for the osteosarcoma treatment , survival rates for osteosarcoma patients have stagnated over the past three decades due to the poor prognosis. Osteosarcoma cancer stem cells ( OSCs) are responsible for the growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma. The existence of OSCs offers a theoretical explanation for therapeutic failures including tumor recurrence , metastasis , and drug resistance. Understanding the pathways that regulate properties of OSCs may shed light on mechanisms that lead to osteosarcoma and suggest better modes of treatment. In this study , we showed that the expression level of Kruppel-like factor 4 ( KLF4) is highly associated with human osteosarcoma cancer stemness. KLF4-overexpressed osteosarcoma cells displayed characteristics of OSCs: increased sphere-forming potential , enhanced levels of stemness-associated genes , great chemoresistance to adriamycin and CDDP , as well as more metastasis potential. Inversely , KLF4 knockdown could reduce colony formation in vitro and inhibit tumorigenesis in vivo , supporting an oncogenic role for KLF4 in osteosarcoma pathogenesis. Furthermore , KLF4 was shown to activate the p38 MAPK signaling pathway to promote cancer stemness. Altogether , our studies uncover an essential role for KLF4 in regulation of OSCs and identify KLF4-p38 MAPK axis as a potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma treatment.
