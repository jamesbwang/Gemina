  Zinc ( ii) and platinum ( ii) complexes ( M ( X-4-C18-salmmen)) ( M = Zn ( 1) and Pt ( 2) , X = R , S ( optical isomer) and rac ( racemate) , salmmen = N , N '- monomethylenebis-salicylideneimine) were synthesized and investigated. The series of compounds represented by 1 ( R , S and rac forms) display liquid crystalline state behaviour at 413 K , and exhibit both ferroelectric and fluorescence properties , while the compounds represented by 2 ( R and S , and rac forms) do not display liquid crystal behaviour but do exhibit ferroelectric and fluorescence properties. The ferroelectric behaviour was confirmed by second harmonic generation ( SHG) experiments. It is considered that the motion and fluctuation of the long alkyl chains in these complexes results in the observed ferroelectric properties.
