  The intense environmental degradation in tropical regions suitable for agriculture has decreased native forest<disease> populations of plants with important fruits and medicinal properties. Alibertia edulis is a native tree from the Brazilian Cerrado. Knowledge about the effects of drying and storage on the physiological behavior of its seeds may aid in its sustainable exploitation and conservation. The goal of the present study was to determine which fruit ripening stage results in A. edulis seeds with higher tolerance to desiccation , and to investigate the effectiveness of polyethylene glycol ( PEG) induced osmotic stress in combination with abscisic acid ( ABA) in increasing seed desiccation tolerance during storage. Seeds were dried in activated silica gel ( fast) or under ambient conditions ( slow). Seeds originating from mid-ripe or fully ripe fruits exhibited better physiological performance than those obtained from green fruits. Slow drying resulted in seeds with high physiological potential. Seeds may be stored for up to 180 days without losing viability when treated with -0.73 MPa PEG without ABA.
