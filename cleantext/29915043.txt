  Secondary active transporters belonging to the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion ( MATE) family harness the potential energy of electrochemical ion gradients to export a broad spectrum of cytotoxic compounds , thus contributing to multidrug resistance. The current mechanistic understanding of ion-coupled substrate transport has been informed by a limited set of MATE transporter crystal structures from multiple organisms that capture a 12-transmembrane helix topology adopting similar outward-facing conformations. Although these structures mapped conserved residues important for function , the mechanistic role of these residues in shaping the conformational cycle has not been investigated. Here , we use double-electron electron resonance ( DEER) spectroscopy to explore ligand-dependent conformational changes of NorM from
