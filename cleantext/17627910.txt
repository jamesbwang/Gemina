  Unlike conventional manufacturing techniques , additive manufacturing ( AM) can form objects of complex shape and geometry in an almost unrestricted manner. AM & rsquo; s advantages include higher control of local process parameters and a possibility to use two or more various materials during manufacture. In this work , we applied one of AM technologies , selective laser melting , using Ti6Al7Nb alloy to produce biomedical functional structures ( BFS) in the form of bone implants. Five types of BFS structures ( A1 , A2 , A3 , B , C) were manufactured for the research. The aim of this study was to investigate such technological aspects as architecture , manufacturing methods , process parameters , surface modification , and to compare them with such functional properties such as accuracy , mechanical , and biological in manufactured implants. Initial in vitro studies were performed using osteoblast cell line hFOB 1.19 ( ATCC CRL-11372) ( American Type Culture Collection). The results of the presented study confirm high applicative potential of AM to produce bone implants of high accuracy and geometric complexity , displaying desired mechanical properties. The experimental tests , as well as geometrical accuracy analysis , showed that the square shaped ( A3) BFS structures were characterized by the lowest deviation range and smallestanisotropy of mechanical properties. Moreover , cell culture experiments performed in this study proved that the designed and obtained implant & rsquo; s internal porosity ( A3) enhances the growth of bone cells ( osteoblasts) and can obtain predesigned biomechanical characteristics comparable to those of the bone tissue.
