  Alterations in cellular and extracellular matrix components play an important role during tumorigenesis; proteoglycans are included among these components. Ameloblastomas are odontogenic tumors distinguished as invasive and infiltrative neoplasms and are divided into different histological types , the most common of which are the unicystic ameloblastoma and the conventional ameloblastoma. The aim of this study was to identify the presence of two proteoglycans , perlecan and biglycan , in different types of ameloblastoma. Using immunohistochemistry , we determined the presence of both proteins in 28 unicystic ameloblastomas and 23 conventional ameloblastomas. We identified the cytoplasmic and nuclear presence of perlecan and the cytoplasmic presence of biglycan in both types of ameloblastoma. The mean values of immunoexpression were higher in the conventional type compared to the unicystic type. Neither the presence of biglycan in ameloblastomas nor the nuclear presence of perlecan in any odontogenic tumor has previously been reported. The differential immunoexpression of perlecan and biglycan in these types of ameloblastomas suggests their participation in the developmental process of these tumors.
