  The microenvironment of peripheral nerve regeneration consists of multiple neurotrophic factors , adhesion molecules , and extracellular matrix molecules , secreted by unique glial cells in the peripheral nerve system ( PNS)- Schwann cell ( SCs). Following peripheral nerve injury ( PNI) , local IGF-1 production is upregulated in SCs and denervated muscle during axonal sprouting and regeneration. Regulation of IGF-1/ IGF-1R signaling is considered as a potentially targeted therapy of PNI. We previously identified a group of novel miRNAs in proximal nerve following rat sciatic nerve transection. The present work focused on the role of miR-129 in regulation of IGF-1 signaling after sciatic nerve injury. The temporal change profile of the miR-129 expression was negatively correlated with the IGF-1 expression in proximal nerve stump and dorsal root ganglion ( DRG) following sciatic nerve transection. An increased expression of miR-129 inhibited proliferation and migration of SCs , and axonal outgrowth of DRG neurons , which was inversely promoted by silencing of the miR-129 expression. The IGF-1 was identified as one of the multiple target genes of miR-129 , which exerted negative regulation of IGF-1 by translational suppression. Moreover , knockdown of IGF-1 attenuated the promoting effects of miR-129 inhibitor on proliferation and migration of SCs , and neurite outgrowth of DRG neurons. Overall , our data indicated that miR-129 own the potential to regulate the proliferation and migration of SCs by targeting IGF-1 , providing further insight into the regulatory role of miRNAs in peripheral nerve regeneration. The present work not only provides new insight into miR-129 regulation of peripheral nerve regeneration by robust phenotypic modulation of neural cells , but also opens a novel therapeutic window for PNI by mediating IGF-1 production. Our results may provide further experimental basis for translation of the molecular therapy into the clinic.
