  To determine the extent to which ( 1) optic nerve tissue is displaced following mild acute elevation of intraocular pressure , and ( 2) clinically accessible measures at the anterior eye can be used as a surrogate for such displacements. We imaged the optic disc of 21 healthy subjects before and after intraocular pressure ( IOP) elevation of ~ 10 mmHg delivered by ophthalmodynamometry. Steady-state tissue displacement during IOP elevation was assessed axially from OCT data , and laterally from SLO data. Recovery from IOP elevation was assessed by tracking a single vertical B-scan through the cup centre. Anatomical structures were demarcated by three masked clinicians to determine lateral shifts for temporal cup edge and central disc vessels , and axial shifts of disc surface and anterior lamina cribrosa. Spatial maps of deformation were constructed within the demarcated cup and disc to assess within-tissue displacement. Measured displacements were correlated with corneal hysteresis , corneal thickness , and IOP. The temporal cup edge moved more temporally with higher baseline IOP ( R Mild acute elevation of IOP produces large and rapidly reversible shifts in optic nerve tissue in young , healthy eyes. The resulting degree , direction and spatial distribution of cup movement are associated with IOP status and corneal thickness , but not corneal hysteresis.
