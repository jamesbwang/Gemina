  While several molecular targets are under consideration , mechanistic underpinnings of the transition from uncomplicated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH) remain unresolved. Here we apply multiscale chemical profiling technologies to mouse models of deranged hepatic ketogenesis to uncover potential NAFLD driver signatures. Use of stable-isotope tracers , quantitatively tracked by nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) spectroscopy , supported previous observations that livers of wild-type mice maintained long term on a high-fat diet ( HFD) exhibit a marked increase in hepatic energy charge. Fed-state ketogenesis rates increased nearly 3-fold in livers of HFD-fed mice , a greater proportionate increase than that observed for tricarboxylic acid ( TCA) cycle flux , but both of these contributors to overall hepatic energy homeostasis fueled markedly increased hepatic glucose production ( HGP). Thus , to selectively determine the role of the ketogenic conduit on HGP and oxidative hepatic fluxes , we studied a ketogenesis-insufficient mouse model generated by knockdown of the mitochondrial isoform of 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase ( HMGCS2). In response to ketogenic insufficiency , TCA cycle flux in the fed state doubled and HGP increased more than 60 % , sourced by a 3-fold increase in glycogenolysis. Finally , high-resolution untargeted metabolomics and shotgun lipidomics performed using ketogenesis-insufficient livers in the fed state revealed accumulation of bis ( monoacylglycero) phosphates , which also accumulated in livers of other models commonly used to study NAFLD. In summary , natural and interventional variations in ketogenesis in the fed state strongly influence hepatic energy homeostasis , glucose metabolism , and the lipidome. Importantly , HGP remains tightly linked to overall hepatic energy charge , which includes both terminal fat oxidation through the TCA cycle and partial oxidation via ketogenesis.
