  Intervertebral disc degeneration ( IDD) is closely related with aging , whereas mitochondrial dysfunction is a common feature of aging in which results cell senescence. Phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN)- induced putative kinase protein 1 ( PINK1) is a mitochondrial-targeted serine/threonine kinase , which plays a protective role against mitochondrial dysfunction with mitochondrial quality control by activating PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy. This study aimed to investigate the protective role of PINK1 against mitochondrial dysfunction and human nucleus pulposus cell ( NPC) senescence. We found that mitochondrial dysfunction and NPC senescence could be induced under sublethal oxidative stress by 150 Î¼M H
