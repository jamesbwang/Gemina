  Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is now the standard of care for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis patients who are at high-surgical risk. Percutaneous approach without a surgical cut down has been increasingly adapted by some centers in USA. Percutaneous approach seems to be associated with shorter hospital stay , similar short and late vascular complications , less disabling stroke , similar mortality as well as significantly less hospital cost. However , this technique also requires operators to be able to manage any vascular complications using advanced endovascular interventions to achieve complete hemostasis.
