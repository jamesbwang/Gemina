  The essential oil extracted from fruit of Micromelum integrrimum were evaluated through gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. 52 compounds were identified from the fruit oil representing 99.98 % of the oil. The major components of the total fruit oil are monoterpene hydrocarbons ( 72.23 %) , oxygenated monoterpenes ( 14.78 %) and sesquiterpene ( 11.54 %) which were predominated by terpinolene ( 32.21 %) , α-pinene ( 17.24 %) , β-pinene ( 17.24 %) , and camphene ( 4.05 %). Moreover , other components that present in 1.45 % were aromatic compounds , fatty acid , etc.. The essential oil exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity which is concentration dependent and 100 μL of the fruit oil showed the inhibition zones ranging from 7-16 mm. Fruit oil exhibited strong inhibition activity compared to standard anti-bacterial drug neomycin B ( 22 mm) against Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> MTCC 441 and Bacillus<pathogen> spizizenii ATCC 6633. This is the first hand report on the chemical profiles and promising anti-microbial activity of Micromelum integrrimum fruit essential oil towards Basillus Sp..
