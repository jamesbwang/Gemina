  Nanodiamonds have demonstrated potential as powerful sensors in biomedicine , however , their translation into routine use requires a comprehensive understanding of their effect on the biological system being interrogated. Under normal fabrication processes , nanodiamonds are produced with a graphitic carbon shell , but are often oxidized in order to modify their surface chemistry for targeting to specific cellular compartments. Here , we assessed the biological impact of this purification process , considering cellular proliferation , uptake , and oxidative stress for graphitic and oxidized nanodiamond surfaces. We show for the first time that oxidized nanodiamonds possess improved biocompatibility compared to graphitic nanodiamonds in breast cancer cell lines , with graphitic nanodiamonds inducing higher levels of oxidative stress despite lower uptake.
