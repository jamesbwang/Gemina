  To evaluate the role of 30-day readmission rate as a quality of care metric in patients undergoing ovarian cancer surgery. We performed a retrospective cohort study of women diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 with advanced-stage , high-grade , serous carcinoma who underwent primary treatment. Using the National Cancer Database , we compared the performance of hospital risk-adjusted 30-day readmission rate to other quality of care metrics ( risk-adjusted 30- and 90-day mortality , rates of adherence to guideline-based care , and overall survival) within hospitals categorized by yearly case volume ( 10 or less , 11-20 , 21-30 , and 31 cases per year or more). A total of 42,931 patients met the inclusion criteria. The overall unplanned 30-day readmission rate was 6.36 % ( 95 % CI 6.13-6.59). After adjusting for comorbidity , stage , histology , and sociodemographic and treatment factors , hospitals performing 31 cases per year or more had a 24 % higher likelihood of readmission ( adjusted odds ratio ( OR) 1.25 , 95 % CI 1.06-1.46) when compared with those performing 10 cases per year or less. However , hospitals performing 31 cases per year or more had a significantly lower risk-adjusted 90-day mortality ( adjusted OR 0.74 , 95 % CI 0.60-0.91) despite higher rates of complex surgical procedures and higher rates of guideline-concordant care delivery ( 86 % vs 77 % , P < .001). In the Cox proportional hazards regression model , care at a high-volume hospital was independently predictive of lower hazard of death ( adjusted hazard ratio 0.86 , 95 % CI 0.82-0.90). Hospitals with 31 cases per year or more have a lower 30- and 90-day mortality despite performing more complex surgeries , are more likely to be adherent to guideline-based care , and achieved higher overall survival.
