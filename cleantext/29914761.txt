  Chronic kidney disease ( CKD) is a public health problem worldwide. We aimed to estimate the CKD prevalence in Spain and to examine the impact of the accumulation of cardiovascular risk factors ( CVRF). We performed a nationwide , population-based survey evaluating 11,505 individuals representative of the Spanish adult population. Information was collected through standardised questionnaires , physical examination , and analysis of blood and urine samples in a central laboratory. CKD was graded according to current KDIGO definitions. The relationship between CKD and 10CVRF was assessed ( age , hypertension , general obesity , abdominal obesity , smoking , high LDL-cholesterol , low HDL-cholesterol , hypertriglyceridaemia , diabetes and sedentary lifestyle). Prevalence of CKD was 15.1 % ( 95 % CI: 14.3-16.0 %). CKD was more common in men ( 23.1 % vs 7.3 % in women) , increased with age ( 4.8 % in 18-44 age group , 17.4 % in 45-64 age group , and 37.3 % in â‰¥ 65) , and was more common in those with than those without cardiovascular disease ( 39.8 % vs 14.6 %); all P < .001. CKD affected 4.5 % of subjects with 0-1CVRF , and then progressively increased from 10.4 % to 52.3 % in subjects with 2 to 8-10CVRF ( P trend < .001). CKD affects one in seven adults in Spain. The prevalence is higher than previously reported and similar to that in the United States. CKD was particularly prevalent in men , older people and people with cardiovascular disease. Prevalence of CKD increased considerably with the accumulation of CVRF , suggesting that CKD could be considered as a cardiovascular condition.
