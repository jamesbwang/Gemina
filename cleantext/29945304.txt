  Adaptive enrichment designs have recently received considerable attention as they have the potential to make drug development process for personalized medicine more efficient. Several statistical approaches have been proposed so far in the literature and the operating characteristics of these approaches are extensively investigated using simulation studies. In this paper , we improve on existing adaptive enrichment designs by assigning unequal weights to the significance levels associated with the hypotheses of the overall population and a prespecified subgroup. More specifically , we focus on the standard combination test , a modified combination test , the marginal combination test , and the partial conditional error rate approach and explore the operating characteristics of these approaches by a simulation study. We show that these approaches can lead to power gains , compared to existing approaches , if the weights are chosen carefully.
