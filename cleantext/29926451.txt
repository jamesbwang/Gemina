  Peptide microarrays are becoming a promising alternative to protein microarrays due to the challenges associated with protein immobilization and purification. Here , we put forward a novel experimental-based approach that combines DNA-directed immobilization , nanografting , and atomic force height measurements to immobilize computationally designed cyclic peptide on an ultra-flat gold substrate. This procedure yields peptide-DNA nanoarrays , which can bind to the solvent-exposed site on the Beta-2-microglobulin ( Î²2m).
