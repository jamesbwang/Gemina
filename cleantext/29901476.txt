  Modafinil may affect autonomic functions in healthy subjects. The aim of the study was to assess the long-term modafinil administration influence on the cardiac autonomic reactivity to orthostatic load in patients with narcolepsy type 1. In 15 patients ( 4 male; 11 female; median age , 47 years; range , 18-70 years) with narcolepsy type 1 treated with modafinil in daily dose of 100 to 300 mg , the short-term spectral analysis of heart rate variability ( HRV) in supine-standing-supine test was performed before and after 72 hours of modafinil discontinuation. The sympathovagal reactivity to orthostatic load was not modified by modafinil treatment; nevertheless , the parasympathetic activity expressed by length of R-R interval and high-frequency component of HRV is reduced in supine position in patients taking modafinil. We conclude that long-term use of modafinil does not influence the cardiac autonomic reactivity to orthostatic load expressed by the HRV changes in supine-standing-supine test in narcolepsy type 1 patients , but the parasympathetic cardiac activity may be reduced in quiet supine position in patients with narcolepsy taking modafinil.
