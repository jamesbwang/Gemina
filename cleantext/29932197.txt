  The impact of the linking group in hydrogen-bonded liquid crystals is systematically studied by a modular approach. POM and DSC results exhibited tremendous differences in the mesomorphic behaviour of the assemblies , due to the versatile linkages of the side chains , which were correlated with structural features and the elctronical nature of the side chains.
