  The growth hormone ( GH) plays a key role in the regulation of metabolic processes in an organism. Determination of the correct structure and functioning of the growth hormone receptor ( GHR) allowed for a more detailed research of its post-receptor regulators , which substantially influences its signal transduction. This review is focused on the description of the post-receptor inhibitors of the GHR-JAK2-STAT pathway , which is one of the most important pathways in the transduction of the somatotropic axis signal. The aim of this review is the short characterization of the main post-receptor inhibitors , such as: cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein ( CIS) , Suppressors of Cytokine Signaling ( SOCS) 1 , 2 and 3 , sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1) , protein inhibitors of activated STAT ( PIAS) 1 , 3 and PIAS4 , protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTP) 1B and H1 , Src homology 2 ( SH2) domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase ( SHP) 1 , 2 and signal regulatory protein ( SIRP) & alpha; 1. The equilibrium between these regulators activity and inhibition is of special concern because , as many studies showed , even slight imbalance may disrupt the GH activity causing serious diseases. The regulation of the described inhibitors expression and activity may be a point of interest for pharmaceutical industry.
