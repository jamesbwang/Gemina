  Direct current ( DC) potently increases the excitability of myelinated afferent fibers in the dorsal columns , both during DC polarization of these fibers and during a considerable ( > 1 hour) post-polarization period. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether similarly long-lasting changes in the excitability of myelinated nerve fibers in the dorsal columns may be evoked by field potentials following stimulation of peripheral afferents and by subthreshold epidurally applied current pulses. The experiments were performed in deeply anaesthetized rats. The effects were monitored by changes in nerve volleys evoked in epidurally stimulated hindlimb afferents and in the synaptic actions of these afferents. Both were found to be facilitated during as well as following stimulation of a skin nerve and during as well as following epidurally applied current pulses of 5-10 ms duration. The facilitation occurring up to 2 min after skin nerve stimulation could be linked to both primary afferent depolarization ( PAD) and large dorsal horn field potentials while the subsequent changes ( up to 1 hour) were attributable to effects of the field potentials. The findings lead to the conclusion that the modulation of spinal activity evoked by DC does not require long-lasting polarization and that relatively short current pulses and intrinsic field potentials may contribute to plasticity in spinal activity. These results suggest the possibility of enhancing the effects of epidural stimulation in human subjects by combining it with polarizing current pulses and peripheral afferent stimulation and not only with continuous DC.
