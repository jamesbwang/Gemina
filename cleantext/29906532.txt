  TMZ is the only drug that has improved survival of GBM patients although minimally. However , a number of GBM patients did not respond to TMZ-based chemotherapy. Here , we found that miR-505 inhibited tumorigenesis as a tumor suppressor in glioblastoma. In addition , TMZ could increase the levels of miR-505 and combination with pri-miR-505 and TMZ promoted the suppressive role mediated by miR-505 in GBM cells. Furthermore , miR-505 inactivated the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway by directly targeting and inhibiting WNT7B. In conclusion , our results demonstrated that the induction of miR-505 in combination with TMZ treatment could be a useful therapeutic strategy for suppressing GBM.
