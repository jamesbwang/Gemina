  ELABELA is a newly discovered peptide hormone that appears to be implicated in the mechanisms leading to preeclampsia , independently of angiogenic factors. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether women with early- or late-onset preeclampsia have altered ELABELA plasma concentrations compared to gestational-age-matched normal pregnant women. This retrospective cross-sectional study focused on the maternal plasma samples collected from 232 women with a singleton pregnancy who were allocated into the following groups: ( 1) early-onset preeclampsia ( < 34 weeks of gestation , N = 56); ( 2) late-onset preeclampsia ( ≥ 34 weeks of gestation , N = 57); and ( 3) gestational-age-matched controls with a normal pregnancy ( ( < 34 weeks of gestation , N = 59); ( ≥ 34 weeks of gestation , N = 60)). ELABELA plasma concentrations were determined using a validated enzyme immunoassay. ( 1) ELABELA plasma concentrations are higher in patients with late-onset preeclampsia compared with those from gestational-age-matched controls with a normal pregnancy ( median: 7.99 ng/mL ( IQR , 5.3-13.95 ng/mL) versus median: 4.17 ng/mL ( IQR , 3-11.19 ng/mL) , p = .001); ( 2) ELABELA plasma concentrations in patients with early-onset preeclampsia do not differ from those of normal pregnant women ( median: 6.09 ng/mL ( IQR , 2.8-10.66 ng/mL) versus median: 4.02 ng/mL ( IQR , 3.26-7.49) , p = .32); and ( 3) ELABELA plasma concentrations are higher in patients with late-onset preeclampsia compared to those with early-onset preeclampsia ( median: 7.99 ng/mL ( IQR , 5.3-13.95 ng/mL) versus median: 6.09 ng/mL ( IQR , 2.8-10.66 ng/mL) , p = .01). ELABELA plasma concentrations are higher in patients with late-onset preeclampsia than in those with a normal pregnancy. However , women with early-onset preeclampsia have similar ELABELA plasma concentrations to those with a normal pregnancy. These findings provide insight into the ELABELA axis during the human<disease> syndrome<disease> of preeclampsia. In addition , these data support the concept that different pathophysiologic mechanisms are implicated in early- and late-onset preeclampsia.
