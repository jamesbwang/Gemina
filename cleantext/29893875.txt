  The highly polymorphic genes of the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC) play a key role in adaptive immunity. Divergent allele advantage , a mechanism of balancing selection , is proposed to contribute to their exceptional polymorphism. It assumes that MHC genotypes with more divergent alleles allow for broader antigen-presentation to immune effector cells , by that increasing immunocompetence. However , the direct correlation between pairwise sequence divergence and the corresponding repertoire of bound peptides has not been studied systematically across different MHC genes. Here , we investigated this relationship for five key classical human MHC genes ( human leukocyte antigen; HLA-A ,- B ,- C ,- DRB1 , and- DQB1) , using allele-specific computational binding prediction to 118,097 peptides derived from a broad range of human pathogens. For all five human MHC genes , the genetic distance between two alleles of a heterozygous genotype was positively correlated with the total number of peptides bound by these two alleles. In accordance with the major antigen-presentation pathway of MHC class I molecules , HLA-B and HLA-C alleles showed particularly strong correlations for peptides derived from intracellular pathogens. Intriguingly , this bias coincides with distinct protein compositions between intra- and extracellular pathogens , possibly suggesting adaptation of MHC I molecules to present specifically intracellular peptides. Eventually , we observed significant positive correlations between an allele 's average divergence and its population frequency. Overall , our results support the divergent allele advantage as a meaningful quantitative mechanism through which pathogen-mediated selection leads to the evolution of MHC diversity.
