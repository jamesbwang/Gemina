  The effect of direct brain responsive neurostimulation on the frequency of electrographic seizures<symptom> in patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy has not been evaluated by chronic ambulatory electrocorticographic monitoring. This was a retrospective study of 9 patients who underwent implantation of the responsive neurostimulator ( RNS) system from 2015 to 2017 at the University of California , Irvine. Leads were placed at the ictal onset zone as determined by intracranial electroencephalography ( EEG). The neurostimulator was programmed to detect and deliver stimulation following identification of the individual 's epileptiform patterns. Electrographic seizures<symptom> were determined by review of all detections. The electrocorticography ( ECoG) seizure<symptom> frequency baseline was the average of the first 2 months postimplantation. The patient-reported seizure<symptom> frequency baseline was the average of the 2 most recent months prior to RNS implantation. Seizure<symptom> control was assessed at 3 months , 6 months , and 12 months. Nine patients were included in the study. All 9 patients have been treated with responsive stimulation for at least 3 months , 7/9 for 6 months , and 4/9 for 12 months. The mean change in seizure<symptom> frequency was -10 % , -19 % , and -56 % at 3 , 6 , and 12 months , respectively , using a self-reported seizure<symptom> frequency baseline compared with -85 % , -71 % , and -56 % at 3 , 6 , and 12 months , respectively , using the ECoG seizure<symptom> frequency baseline. Chronic ECoG may provide a more accurate estimate of seizure<symptom> frequency and provide additional insight into the true efficacy of the RNS system.
