  Metal ion transporters of the Zrt- and Irt-like protein ( ZIP , or SLC39A) family transport zinc , iron , manganese and/or cadmium across cellular membranes<symptom> and into the cytosol. The 14 human ZIP family proteins are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and function in many different cellular processes. Many of these proteins ( including ZIP1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6/10 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 14) are situated , at least some of the time , on the plasma membrane , where they mediate metal ion uptake into cells. Their level on the cell surface can be controlled rapidly via protein trafficking in response to the ions they transport. For example , the cell surface level of many ZIPs ( including ZIP1 , 3 , 4 , 8 and 12) is mediated by the available concentration of zinc. Zinc depletion causes a decrease in endocytosis and degradation , resulting in more ZIP on the surface to take up the essential ion. ZIP levels on the cell surface are a balance<symptom> between endocytosis , recycling and degradation. We review the trafficking mechanisms of human ZIP proteins , highlighting possible targeting motifs and suggesting a model of zinc-mediated endocytic trafficking. We also provide two possible models for ZIP14 trafficking and degradation.
