  The effect of freeze- and spray-drying on physico-chemical characteristics , phenolics compounds and antioxidant activity of papaya pulp was investigated. The frozen pulp was freeze dried at- 62 Â°C during 48 h. Papaya pulp with 14 % DE maltodextrin was also dried in a spray dryer. The organic acids , sugars , color , total soluble solids , pH , carotenoids , phenolic and flavonoid compounds , and antioxidant capacity values were determined. The changes in color , pH and lycopene were negligible. However , lower retention ( 86.5 %) of vitamin C and sugars ( glucose-79.7 % and fructose-66.1 %) was observed in spray dried products. Phenolic and flavonoid compounds were identified and quantified in dried papaya products by UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS. Spray dried products presented a higher retention of phenolic and flavonoid compounds compared to the freeze dried products. Despite some variations in the parameters studied , the use of freeze- and spray-drying has proven viable options for the drying of papaya pulp.
