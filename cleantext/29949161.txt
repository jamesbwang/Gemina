  miRNAs have been confirmed to be related to cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this study , we detected the potential effect of miR-448 on glioma cell proliferation and apoptosis. miR-448 and CTTN expression levels were detected in glioma cell lines with quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR). Cells were transfected with miR-448 mimics and inhibitor by using lipofectamine 2000 respectively. The proliferative ability of transfected cells was detected via methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT) and cell counting kit-8 ( CCK8) assays. Cell apoptosis and cell-cycle were tested using flow cytometry. The regulatory correlation between miR-448 and CTTN was explored by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. Lower expression of miR-448 and higher level of CTTN were detected in glioma cells. MiR-448 could regulate cell proliferation , cell apoptosis , and cell cycle. CTTN was negatively regulated by miR-448. miR-448 downregulates CTTN to inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis in glioma , which indicates a potential therapeutic target of glioma.
