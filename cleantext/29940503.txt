  With advances in soft material design and engineering , naturally resourced polysaccharides have frequently been used to construct hydrogels because of their unique properties such as renewability , biodegradability and biocompatibility. In this work , we use a water-soluble microbial polysaccharide , salecan as a trapped natural polymer , poly ( acrylamide-co-diallyldimethylammonium chloride) ( PAD) as a functional matrix to prepare salecan/PAD hydrogels through a facile one-pot method. We employed a variety of spectroscopic techniques to probe the physicochemical properties of the designed hydrogels. The results demonstrated that salecan not only tuned the polarity of the PAD hydrogels , but also endowed them with adjustable water content. Subsequently , the adsorption performance of these hydrogels to methyl orange ( MO) dye was investigated in detail. It was found that the salecan/PAD had the ability to remove MO from the surrounding aqueous solutions. In addition , adsorption kinetic data were nicely described by pseudo-second-order model and the adsorption isotherm data fitted well with the Freundlich equation. Having tailorable physicochemical properties coupled with the ability to uptake dye , these salecan-incorporated hydrogels could be promising platform for wastewater treatment and removal of heavy metal ions.
