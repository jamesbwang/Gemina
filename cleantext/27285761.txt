  The aim of the present study was to examine the diagnosis of methylation of CDX2 gene promoter in colorectal cancer ( CRC) and assessed its value in the prediction of treatment efficacy. Sixty patients who were diagnosed as CRCs for the first time , 60 patients with hyperplastic polyps ( HPs) and adenomas , and 60 patients with inflammatory lesions<symptom> or healthy patients ( control group) were included in the present study. The methylation levels of CDX2 gene promoter were detected by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction ( MSP) , and the expression levels of CDX2 mRNA were detected by fluorescence quantitative PCR. Treatment options , such as surgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy , were chosen on the basis of TNM staging of CRC patients. The tumor-free survival , relapse rate and mortality were also recorded. The methylation rate was 71.67 % ( 43/60) and significantly higher in the CRC group as compared to the HP/adenoma and control groups , P < 0.05. Moreover , they showed further increase with higher degree of TNM staging. The expression levels of CDX2 mRNA was significantly lower in the CRC group in comparison to HP/adenoma and control groups , P < 0.05 , and showed a further decrease with a higher degree of TNM staging. The tumor-free survival was shorter , and the relapse rate and mortality were higher in patients with positive methylation in the CRC group , P < 0.05. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that TNM staging and positive methylation were independent risk factors of mortality. In conclusion , higher methylation degree of CDX2 gene promoter resulted in decreased expression of
