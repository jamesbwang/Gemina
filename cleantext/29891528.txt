  Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC) is a neuroendocrine skin cancer. The clinical impact of MCC has been increasing due to steadily rising incidence rates. Since 2001 , more than 24,000 cases of MCC have been reported to the US National Program of Cancer Registries database , and in 2018 , more than 2,500 incident cases are expected. MCC is highly aggressive , and one-third of patients will either present with or develop metastatic disease. Outcomes in patients with metastatic MCC have historically been poor; median time to progression with cytotoxic chemotherapy is only 3 months. MCC has long been appreciated to be immunogenic , with reports of spontaneous regression and responsiveness to immunotherapy. However , the mechanisms of this immunogenicity have only been understood over the past decade , with approximately 80 % of cases in the United States associated with the Merkel cell polyomavirus<pathogen> ( MCPyV) and expression of viral antigens ( virus-positive ( VP) MCC) , and the remaining 20 % of cases caused by UV radiation-induced damage leading to a high mutational burden and expression of neoantigens ( virus-negative ( VN) MCC). These insights have led to multiple successful trials of immunotherapies for MCC. PD-1 axis checkpoint inhibitors are now regarded as the preferred frontline systemic therapy in eligible patients ( including both VP- and VN-MCC) , with impressive frequency , durability , and depth of objective responses , which compare favorably to those of most solid tumors. This article reviews the safety and efficacy data from the key clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors for metastatic MCC , and discusses several issues relevant to the clinical use of these agents. Finally , emerging immunotherapies for MCC , including cellular therapies and adjuvant systemic therapies , are reviewed.
