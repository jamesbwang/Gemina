  Iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula<disease> is a unique complication during pacemaker implantation. A 55-year-old man was posted for pacemaker implantation for recurrent unexplained syncope with trifascicular AV block. After axillary/subclavian venous puncture and introduction of RV lead , arterial spurting was immediately noticed as the the sheath was peeled away. After dissecting the overlying pectoralis muscle , deep sutures and manual compression achieved hemostasis. However , Subclavian arteriogram revealed an arteriovenous fistula<disease> from a lateral thoracic artery branch to the innominate vein. Hilal coils were deployed near the fistulous orifice , leading to complete resolution of the leak. After 3 days , pacemaker was implanted from right side. A multidisciplinary approach was the key to successful outcome.
