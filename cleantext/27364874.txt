  We performed an e-Survey and reviewed the literature on the prevalence of use of brachytherapy in head and neck cancers in order to understand the patterns of care and probable application of this modality. A five-point questionnaire was prepared and sent to 300 oncologists through a web-based survey engine. This was done in preparation for my lecture on `` Ongoing Research and Potential Research Avenues '' in IBSCON held in Chennai in August 2016. SPSS software was used for the statistical analysis. Of a total of 300 emails that were sent out for the survey , 120 replies were received , which is 40 %. Among the results of various questions , ( i) 65 % of the oncologists felt that there were > 300 ongoing studies in brachytherapy and out of them only 10-20 were on head and neck brachytherapy; ( ii) 58 % of the responders felt that external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT) advances followed by lack of training and experience are the reasons for declining role of brachytherapy; ( iii) among the responders , numbers of head and neck brachytherapy performed stand<symptom> third after gynecological and breast brachytherapy. This survey shows that brachytherapy in head and neck cancers is an essential tool , but seldom practiced. If no path-breaking event happens , we may be dealing with it as a dying art.
