  The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha ( CEBPA) is lineage-specific transcription factor in the hematopoietic system. In this study , we aimed on the clinical features and the prognostic significance associated with CEBPA mutations in 30 pediatric patients with acute leukemia<disease>. In addition , the association between found variants and mutations of Ten-Eleven-Translocation 2 ( TET2) , Kirsten rat sarcoma<disease> viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS) , and Casitas B-cell lymphoma ( CBL) , FLT3 ( Fms-Related Tyrosine Kinase) , JAK2 ( Januse Kinase-2) and Nucleophosmin 1 ( NPM1) were analyzed , which are important prognostic risk factors for pediatric acute leukemia<disease> patients. The entire CEBPA coding region was screened using the NGS method. CEBPA mutations were detected in 16 ( 53.3 %) of 30 patients. In total , ten distinct of nucleotide changes were identified in 30 patients , including 6 novel and 4 known mutations by sequencing the entire CEBPA gene. We found 6 frame shift mutations , 1 missense mutation , 3 synonymous variants. The most common mutation was the c. 487del G resulting p.Glu163Ser in 5 cases. Three patients carried CEBPA double mutations. The detected variants in this article seemed to be the first screening results of genes studied by NGS in pediatric acute leukemia<disease> patients. Our results also showed some degree of association between FLT3-ITD , TET2 , KRAS , CBL and CEBPA mutations ( Tab. 4 , Fig. 1 , Ref. 24).
