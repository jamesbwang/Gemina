  The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between muscle cross-sectional area ( CSA) , maximal strength , power output , and maximum potentiation characteristics. The vastus lateralis and biceps femoris CSA , one repetition maximum ( 1RM) back squat , 1RM concentric-only half-squat ( COHS) strength , static jump power output , and maximum potentiation characteristics of 17 resistance-trained men was assessed during several testing sessions. Pearson 's correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationships between CSA , strength , power output , and maximum potentiation measures. Moderate-to-strong relationships existed between CSA and strength measures (
