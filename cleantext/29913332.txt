  In studying the ecophysiology of fungal phytopathogens , several stages are involved ( in vitro , greenhouse , in planta). Most in vitro studies extensively utilise the general growth media such as Potato Dextrose Agar and Malt Extract Agar. Although the crop components in these media serve as excellent carbon sources and yield luxuriant growth , they are not naturally contaminated with Aspergillus<pathogen> flavus<pathogen> and thus might result in under- or overestimation of its actual toxigenic potentials. Empirical data on the formulation of semi-synthetic growth medium mimicking the natural crop commonly contaminated by A.<pathogen> flavus<pathogen> for the ecophysiological studies in vitro are scarce. The present work was aimed at investigating the ecophysiology of A.<pathogen> flavus<pathogen> on commercial growth media ( PDA , MEA); formulating maize- and peanut-based semi-synthetic growth media using two methods of raw material preparation ( milling , hot water extraction) at different concentrations ( 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 % w/v) , and comparing the ecophysiological parameters between commercial and formulated growth media. Growth rates were obtained by computing the hyphal expansion data into y = mx + c equation. AFB
