  Childhood sexual abuse ( CSA) has been reported to be disproportionately higher among young men who have sex with men ( YMSM) than among heterosexual men. Most research and public health programs among YMSM CSA survivors have been mainly infectious disease-based , and research on the physical sexual health among this group is limited. This study sought to further understand components of physical sexual health among YMSM with CSA histories. Sixteen participants were recruited , and through a phenomenological approach , semi-structured interviews were conducted. Four themes were found , participants ( 1) reported a one-dimensional definition of sexual health; ( 2) had limitations in health insurance hindering preventative care; ( 3) described reoccurring anal pain during sexual intercourse; and ( 4) conveyed a positive perception of sexual satisfaction. These findings indicate a need for healthcare providers , health educators , and researchers to increase awareness about the comprehensive needs of YMSM with CSA histories.
