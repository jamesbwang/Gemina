  No effective targeted therapy exists for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC) , the major cell type of esophageal cancer. The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin ( IL) -6 is associated with adverse prognosis of some cancers , and the open reading frame of IL-6 contains an miR-608 microRNA-targeted site. We investigated the correlation of circulating IL-6 levels with prognosis and with the mir608: rs4919510 genetic polymorphism in ESCC. A total of 213 patients with primary ESCC were enrolled. Plasma IL-6 levels of ESCC patients were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). The patients ' genotypes of mir608: rs4919510 were analyzed using the MassARRAY system , and functional assays were performed by transient overexpression in cells. The cytotoxicity of IL-6 signaling blockers in ESCC cells was analyzed by MTT assay. We found that plasma IL-6 levels significantly correlated with overall survival ( p = 0.019) , disease recurrence ( p = 0.003) , and postoperative complications ( p = 0.002). Patients with the GG genotype of mir608: rs4919510 had a 4.56-fold increased risk of high expression of IL-6 compared with patients with the CC genotype ( odds ratio 4.56 , 95 % confidence interval 1.87-11.09; p = 0.001). Transient overexpression of the miR-608 C ( miR-608_C) and G variants ( miR-608_G) in cancer cells revealed that the miR-608_G variant was less efficient in regulating the expression of IL-6 compared with miR-608_C. Finally , the IL-6 signaling blocker ruxolitinib exhibited effective cytotoxicity in ESCC cells. The results of this study provide a novel direction for a biomarker-based targeted therapy for ESCC.
