  The most widely used type II pyrethroid is β-cypermethrin ( β-CYP) , and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid ( 3-PBA) is one of its primary metabolites. Although CYP has been shown to pose toxic effects in some immune cells , as of now the immunotoxicity of CYP on immune progenitor cells has not been well studied. In this study , we evaluated the immunotoxicity of β-CYP and 3-PBA on the human promyelocytic leukemia<disease> cell line , HL-60. Both β-CYP and 3-PBA reduced cell viability. In addition , both β-CYP and 3-PBA stimulated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a dose- and time-dependent manner , while only β-CYP induced cell cycle arrest in G1 stage. Moreover , exposure to β-CYP and 3-PBA at 100 μM inhibited all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA)- induced mRNA expressions of the granulocytic differentiation-related genes , CD11b and CSF-3R. Furthermore , exposure to β-CYP and 3-PBA resulted in a downregulation of the granulocytic differentiation promoting transcriptional factors , PU .1 and C/EBPε. Furthermore , we found that β-CYP and 3-PBA exposure led to elevated levels of cellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , and that pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine ( NAC) blocked the toxic effects caused by β-CYP and 3-PBA. The results obtained in the present study provide evidence showing the immunotoxic effects of β-CYP and 3-PBA on promyelocytic cells as well as its possible underlying mechanism.
