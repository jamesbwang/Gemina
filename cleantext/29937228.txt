  Pain , depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , sleep disturbances , and constipation<symptom> were reported in different symptom clusters at different stages of breast cancer. Managing symptom clusters rather than individual symptoms can improve performance status. The study examined the effect of pain symptom<symptom> cluster ( pain and constipation<symptom>) on performance when mediated by the psychoneurological symptom cluster ( depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , and sleep disturbances) using age as a moderator. A secondary analysis. Palliative care center at a tertiary medical center in northeast Ohio. Eighty-six women diagnosed with advanced breast cancer. A quantitative cross-sectional approach. Ordinal logistic regression showed that pain symptom<symptom> cluster did not have a significant mediation effect on performance. Odds ratio indicated that subjects with pain symptom<symptom> cluster were 63 % more likely to be bedridden ( odds ratio = 1.63 , confidence interval = .69-3.84). Women who reported pain symptom<symptom> cluster were 5 % more likely to have psychoneurological symptom cluster ( odds ratio = 1.05 , confidence interval = .400-2.774). Stratified analysis of age showed no differences in performance. Post-hoc analysis showed that the components of pain symptom<symptom> cluster had a significant effect on psychoneurological symptom cluster ( odds ratio: 3 ( 1.18-7.62)). Pain , constipation<symptom> , depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , and sleep disturbances were highly prevalent in women with advanced breast cancer. However , they tended to cluster in different symptom clusters. Although some findings were not significant , they all supported the direction of the tested hypotheses. Variations in symptom clusters research , including methodology , instruments , statistical tests , and chosen symptom cluster correlation coefficient , should be addressed.
