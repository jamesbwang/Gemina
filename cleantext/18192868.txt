  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC) has a dismal prognosis. To improve outcomes , there is a critical need for improved tools for detection , accurate staging , and resectability assessment. This could improve patient stratification for the most optimal primary treatment modality. Molecular imaging , used in combination with tumor-specific imaging agents , can improve established imaging methods for PDAC. These novel , tumor-specific imaging agents developed to target specific biomarkers have the potential to specifically differentiate between malignant and benign diseases , such as pancreatitis<disease> When these agents are coupled to various types of labels , this type of molecular imaging can provide integrated diagnostic , noninvasive imaging of PDAC as well as image-guided pancreatic surgery. This review provides a detailed overview of the current clinical imaging applications , upcoming molecular imaging strategies for PDAC , and potential targets for imaging , with an emphasis on intraoperative imaging applications.
