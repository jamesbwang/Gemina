  Placental abruption is an important cause of feto-maternal hemorrhage<symptom> , with significant impact on both fetal and maternal mortality. In most cases , it presents with abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and vaginal bleeding. However , vaginal bleeding may be absent with concealed intra-amniotic hemorrhage<symptom> , as in cases with placenta previa , hence confounding this diagnosis. In such cases , imaging studies may be obtained to evaluate for abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> in pregnancy; hence , radiologists should be aware of the ultrasound and magnetic resonance ( MR) imaging appearance of intra-amniotic hemorrhage<symptom>. This includes presence of markedly echogenic amniotic fluid on US. Hemorrhage<symptom> signal intensity on MR imaging varies with the duration of bleeding. In acute to subacute cases , it will present as T1 isointense and T2 hypointense amniotic fluid. This case is the first report of MR imaging findings of acute concealed intra-amniotic
