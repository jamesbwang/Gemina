  In this review , we discuss the opportunity for repurposing drugs for use in l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia ( LID) in Parkinson 's disease. LID is a particularly suitable indication for drug repurposing given its pharmacological diversity , translatability of animal-models , availability of Phase II proof-of-concept ( PoC) methodologies and the indication-specific regulatory environment. A compound fit for repurposing is defined as one with appropriate human safety-data as well as animal safety , toxicology and pharmacokinetic data as found in an Investigational New Drug ( IND) package for another indication. We first focus on how such repurposing candidates can be identified and then discuss development strategies that might progress such a candidate towards a Phase II clinical PoC. We discuss traditional means for identifying repurposing candidates and contrast these with newer approaches , especially focussing on the use of computational and artificial intelligence ( AI) platforms. We discuss strategies that can be categorised broadly as: in vivo phenotypic screening in a hypothesis-free manner; in vivo phenotypic screening based on analogy to a related disorder; hypothesis-driven evaluation of candidates in vivo and in silico screening with a hypothesis-agnostic component to the selection. To highlight the power of AI approaches , we describe a case study using IBM Watson where a training set of compounds , with demonstrated ability to reduce LID , were employed to identify novel repurposing candidates. Using the approaches discussed , many diverse candidates for repurposing in LID , originally envisaged for other indications , will be described that have already been evaluated for efficacy in non-human primate models of LID and/or clinically.
