  Women with HIV<pathogen> face an increased risk of human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) acquisition and persistence , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , and invasive cervical cancer. Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of different cervical cancer screening strategies among women with HIV<pathogen> in South Africa. We modified a mathematical model of HPV<pathogen> infection and cervical disease to reflect co-infection with HIV<pathogen>. The model was calibrated to epidemiologic data from HIV-infected women in South Africa. Clinical and economic data were drawn from in-country data sources. The model was used to project reductions in the lifetime risk of cervical cancer and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ( ICERs) of Pap and HPV<pathogen> DNA screening and management algorithms beginning at HIV<pathogen> diagnosis , at one- , two- , or three-year intervals. Strategies with an ICER below South Africa 's 2016 per capita GDP ( US$ 5,270) were considered ` cost-effective. ' HPV<pathogen> testing followed by treatment ( test-and-treat) at two-year intervals was the most effective strategy that was also cost-effective , reducing lifetime cancer risk by 56 Â· 6 % with an ICER of US$ 3,010 per year of life saved ( YLS). Other cost-effective strategies included Pap ( referral threshold: HSIL +) at one- , two- , and three-year intervals , and HPV<pathogen> test-and-treat at three-year intervals. Pap ( ASCUS +) , HPV<pathogen> testing with 16/18 genotyping , and HPV<pathogen> testing with Pap or visual triage of HPV-positive women were less effective and more costly than alternatives. Considering per capita GDP as the benchmark for cost-effectiveness , HPV<pathogen> test-and-treat is optimal in South Africa. At lower cost-effectiveness benchmarks , Pap ( HSIL +) would be optimal.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 ( CC BY) , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original work is properly cited.
