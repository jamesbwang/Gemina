  For optoelectronic devices , an attractive research field involves the flexible adjustment of the band gap in semiconductor quantum well ( QW) structures by strain engineering. However , rigid wafer-based technology enables lattice-misfit strain during epitaxial growth , which is biaxial , unchangeable , and not sufficient for the devices fitted on various irregular surfaces. Therefore , exploiting the strain produced by externally deformed configurations offers unique opportunities to continuously and non-defectively tune the QW 's band structure. Here , we propose a strategy to induce uniaxially distributed strain in elaborately designed wavy quantum well nanoribbons ( QWNRs). Meanwhile , a numerically solved strain-photonic coupling model based on the theory of elasticity and the eight-band k · p method is established to illustrate the strain distribution coupled with the strain-induced band gap shift of the wavy QWNR. The μ-photoluminescence measurements reveal a periodically varied band gap in the QW along the uniaxial tensile direction , which is consistent with the result of theoretical calculations. This model demonstrates the potential application of a wrinkled configuration in arbitrarily controlling and tuning the band gap and thus the optoelectronic performances of quantum well systems.
