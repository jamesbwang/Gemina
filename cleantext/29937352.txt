  The ability to represent the world accurately relies on simultaneous coarse and fine-grained neural information coding , capturing both gist and detail of an experience. The longitudinal axis of the hippocampus may provide a gradient of representational granularity in spatial and episodic memory in rodents and humans ( 1-8). Rodent place cells in the ventral hippocampus exhibit significantly larger place fields and greater autocorrelation than those in the dorsal hippocampus ( 1 , 9-11) , which may underlie a coarser and slower changing representation of space ( 10 , 12). Recent evidence suggests that properties of cellular dynamics in rodents can be captured with fMRI in humans during spatial navigation ( 13) and conceptual learning ( 14). Similarly , mechanisms supporting granularity along the long axis may also be extrapolated to the scale of fMRI signal. Here , we provide the first evidence for separable scales of representation along the human hippocampal anteroposterior axis during navigation and rest by showing ( 1) greater similarity among voxel time courses and ( 2) higher temporal autocorrelation in anterior hippocampus ( aHPC) , relative to posterior hippocampus ( pHPC) , the human homologs of ventral and dorsal rodent hippocampus. aHPC voxels exhibited more similar activity at each time point and slower signal change over time than voxels in pHPC , consistent with place field organization in rodents. Importantly , similarity between voxels was related to navigational strategy and episodic memory. These findings provide evidence that the human hippocampus supports an anterior-to-posterior gradient of coarse-to-fine spatiotemporal representations , suggesting the existence of a cross-species mechanism , whereby lower neural similarity supports more complex coding of experience.
