  Water-soluble , highly fluorescent host-guest chromophore-cucurbit ( 8) uril supramolecular polymer bundles are investigated by polarized time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy , structural methods , and quantum chemistry to fully reveal structural organization and heterogeneity but , in particular , energy-transfer dynamics , being of crucial importance for the design of supramolecular artificial light-harvesting systems.
