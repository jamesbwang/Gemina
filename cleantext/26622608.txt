  The aim of the present study was to determine whether acetazolamide ( Ace) treatment enhances the chemosensitivity of Hep-2 laryngeal cells to cisplatin ( Cis). At the logarithmic growth phase , Hep-2 cells were treated with Ace , Cis or both , and cell viability was detected using an MTT assay. The degree of apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry. Expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins , including BCL2 apoptosis regulator ( bcl-2) , BCL2 associated X ( bax) and caspase-3 , and of proliferation-related proteins , including proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA) and tumor protein p53 ( P53) , were detected using western blotting. mRNA expression levels of aquaporin-1 ( AQP1) in each group were detected using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Compared with the drugs used alone , treatment with both Ace and Cis displayed synergistic effects on the growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in Hep-2 cells. The Ace/Cis combination decreased the expression of PCNA but increased the expression of p53. In addition , the combination treatment decreased the ratio of bcl-2/ bax and increased the expression of caspase-3 , as well as decreased the expression of AQP1. These results demonstrated that the combined use of Ace and Cis enhanced the chemosensitivity of laryngeal carcinoma cells.
