  Background Aging is associated with change in health status and decreasing functional capacity affecting the general well-being of individuals with increase in the prevalence of chronic noncommunicable diseases. Objective This study aimed to assess the quality of life ( QoL) and its determinants in elderly patients attending a general practice clinic in Southwest Nigeria. Method Descriptive cross-sectional study of consenting elderly patients completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire on QoL and its determinants. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential analysis. Logistic regression was done to identify predictors of QoL. Results A total of 216 older adults were interviewed. Only 25 % had good QoL with majority having multiple morbidities which was associated with poorer QoL. Predictors of QoL were family support ( odds ratio = 0.249 , 95 % confidence interval ( 0.079 , 0.850) , p = .026) and socioeconomic class ( odds ratio = 3.66 , 95 % confidence interval ( 1.47 , 7.87) , p = .004) of the respondents. Conclusion QoL was found to be poor among the study population and worst in those with multiple morbidities. There is a need for policy direction to advocate for preventive strategies for risk of chronic<disease> diseases<disease> as well as provide better access to primary care through National Health Insurance Scheme ( NHIS).
