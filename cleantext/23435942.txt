  Dioxoisoindolines have been included as a pharmacophore group in diverse drug-like molecules with a wide range of biological activity. Various reports have shown that phthalimide derivatives are potent inhibitors of AChE , a key enzyme involved in the deterioration of the cholinergic system during the development of Alzheimer 's disease. In the present study , 2- ( 2- ( 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) ethyl) isoindoline-1,3-dione was synthesized , crystallized and evaluated as an AChE inhibitor. The geometric structure of the crystal and the theoretical compound ( from molecular modeling) were analyzed and compared , finding a close correlation. The formation of the C6-H6 · · · O19 interaction could be responsible for the non-negligible out of phenyl plane deviation of the C19 methoxy group , the O3 from the carbonyl group lead to C16-H16 · · · O3
