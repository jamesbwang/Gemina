  Researchers in data-rich disciplines-think of computational genomics and observational cosmology-often wish to mine large bodies of ( Formula: see text)- values looking for significant effects , while controlling the false discovery rate or family-wise error rate. Increasingly , researchers also wish to prioritize certain hypotheses , for example , those thought to have larger effect sizes , by upweighting , and to impose constraints on the underlying mining , such as monotonicity along a certain sequence. We introduce
