  Grapheme-color synesthesia is a condition in which objectively achromatic graphemes induce concurrent color experiences. While it was long thought that the colors emerge during perception , there is growing support for the view that colors are integral to synesthetes ' cognitive representations of graphemes. In this work , we review evidence for two opposing theories positing either a perceptual or cognitive origin of concurrent colors: the cross-activation theory and the conceptual-mediation model. The review covers results on inducer and concurrent color processing as well as findings concerning the brain structure and grapheme-color mappings in synesthetes and trained mappings in nonsynesthetes. The results support different aspects of both theories. Finally , we discuss how research on memory colors could provide a new perspective in the debate about the level of processing at which the synesthetic colors occur.
