  For many years , researchers in the field of autoimmunity have focused on the role of the immune components in the etiopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. However , some studies have demonstrated the importance of target tissues in their pathogenesis and the breach of immune tolerance. The immune system as well as target tissue cells ( plasmatic , β-pancreatic , fibroblast-like synoviocytes , thyroid follicular and epithelial cells of the lachrymal glands , salivary glands , intestine , bronchioles and renal tubules) share the characteristic of secretory cells with an extended endoplasmic reticulum ( ER). The function of these cells depends considerably on a normal ER function and calcium homeostasis , so they can produce and secrete their main components , which include glycoproteins involved in antigenic presentation such as major histocompatibility complex ( MHC) class I and II. All these proteins are synthesized and modified in the ER , and for this reason disturbances in the normal functions of this organelle such as protein folding , protein quality control , calcium homeostasis and redox balance<symptom> , promote accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins , a condition known as ER stress. Autoimmune diseases are characterized by inflammation<symptom> , which has been associated with an ER stress condition. Interestingly , patients with these diseases contain circulating auto-antibodies against chaperone proteins ( such as Calnexin and GRP94) , thus affecting the folding and assembly of MHC class I and II glycoproteins and their loading with peptide. The main purpose of this article is to review the involvement of the protein quality control and unfolded protein response ( UPR) in the ER protein homeostasis ( proteostasis) and their alterations in autoimmune diseases. In addition , we describe the interaction between ER stress and inflammation<symptom> and evidences are shown of how autoimmune diseases are associated with an ER stress condition , with a special emphasis on the second most prevalent autoimmune rheumatic disease , Sjögren 's
