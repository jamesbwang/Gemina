  The successful treatment of chronic dermal wounds<disease> , such as diabetic foot ulcers<disease> ( DFU) , depends on the development of safe , effective , and affordable regenerative tools that the surgeon can rely on to promote wound<disease> closure. Although promising , strategies that involve cell-based therapies and the local release of exogenous growth factors are costly , require very long development times , and result in modest improvements in patient outcome. We describe the development of an antioxidant shape-conforming regenerative wound<disease> dressing that uses the laminin-derived dodecapeptide A5G81 as a potent tethered cell adhesion- , proliferation- , and haptokinesis-inducing ligand to locally promote wound<disease> closure. A5G81 immobilized within a thermoresponsive citrate-based hydrogel facilitates integrin-mediated spreading , migration , and proliferation of dermal and epidermal cells , resulting in faster tissue regeneration in diabetic wounds<disease> This peptide-hydrogel system represents a paradigm shift in dermoconductive and dermoinductive strategies for treating DFU without the need for soluble biological or pharmacological factors.
