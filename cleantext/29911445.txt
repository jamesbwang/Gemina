  Despite the enormous resources spent by states in the United States on bridging the gap between criminal justice and behavioral health services , there have been relatively few statewide evaluations of drug treatment client recidivism. We present the results of an evaluation of recidivism outcomes for a sample of individuals ( n = 1,274) referred to the Treatment Accountability for Safer Communities ( TASC) program in North Carolina from 2007 to 2008. The methodology accounted for both client and offense characteristics drawn from TASC , court , and corrections records. Multivariate analyses indicated that program completion is the most important predictor of re-arrest in the 3-year follow-up period , followed by a number of protective and risk factors. More specifically , being female , older at the time of program entry , as well as higher levels of educational attainment decreased the odds of re-arrest , whereas using crack/cocaine increased the odds of re-arrest. Suggestions for future research and policy implications are provided.
