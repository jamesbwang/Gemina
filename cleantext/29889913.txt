  Flap management is one of the key elements for success in periodontal surgeries and bone regeneration for dental implants. The aim of this article is to introduce a releasing incision method for effective flap advancement to obtain tension-free primary closure. The ` upward-motion scissors technique ' ( UMST) involves the use of surgical scissors handled with an upward motion to create multiple shallow incisions. The use of UMST is demonstrated in an anatomically challenging case requiring bone augmentation. This technique provides a novel approach for flap advancement and may reduce potential complications involved in releasing incisions. The true benefit of UMST needs to be evaluated in future studies.
