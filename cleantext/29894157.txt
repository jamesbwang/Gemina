  During the past decade , the research field of computational X-ray spectroscopy has witnessed an advancement triggered by the development of advanced synchrotron light sources and X-ray free electron lasers that in turn has enabled new sophisticated experiments with needs for supporting theoretical investigations. Following a discussion about fundamental conceptual aspects of the physical nature of core excitations and the concomitant requirements on theoretical methods , an overview is given of the major developments made in electronic-structure theory for the purpose of simulating advanced X-ray spectroscopies , covering methods based on density-functional theory as well as wave function theory. The capabilities of these theoretical approaches are illustrated by an overview of simulations of selected linear and nonlinear X-ray spectroscopies , including X-ray absorption spectroscopy ( XAS) , X-ray natural circular dichroism ( XNCD) , X-ray emission spectroscopy ( XES) , resonant inelastic X-ray scattering ( RIXS) , and X-ray two-photon absorption ( XTPA).
