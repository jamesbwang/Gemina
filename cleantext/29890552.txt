  Co-inhibitory receptors ( IR) , such as TIGIT and FCRL3 , provide a checkpoint against highly destructive immune responses. Co-expression of TIGIT and FCRL3 , in particular , has been linked to the HELIOS Thirty patients with AT ( encompassing spontaneously euthyroid ( euAT) , hypothyroid-untreated and L-thyroxine-treated cases)) and 10 healthy controls ( HC) were recruited. FCRL3 , TIGIT , HELIOS and FOXP3E2 mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood ( PB) T cells were measured via quantitative real-time PCR and compared to clinicopathological factors. The TIGIT and FCRL3 expression levels from T cells of AT cases were inversely related to the thyroid volume , and were significantly increased in hypothyroid patients ( on + off L-thyroxine) , but not euAT cases. The FCRL3 expression in PB T cells positively correlated with thyroid-peroxidase autoantibody levels; by contrast , T cells from aged AT patients and combined samples ( AT+HC) accumulated more TIGIT mRNA. The patients with higher TIGIT mRNA levels had a greater prevalence of hypothyroidism , showing higher peak thyrotropin levels at diagnosis or at follow-up. Multiple IR , namely FCRL3 and TIGIT , but not the transcription factors HELIOS and FOXP3E2 , showed increased mRNA levels in PB T cells from end-stage , long-standing and/or more aggressive AT , in proportion to disease severity. A relation with major clinical subphenotypes was observed , thereby identifying IR as potentially important players in AT.
