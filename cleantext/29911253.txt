  A potential role of marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( ω-3 PUFAs) has been suggested in memory , learning , and cognitive processes. Therefore , ω-3 PUFAs might be a promising treatment option , albeit controversial , for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). Among the different mechanisms that have been proposed as responsible for the beneficial effects of ω-3 PUFAs , inhibition of JNK stands as a particularly interesting candidate. In the present work , it has been studied whether the administration of two different PUFAs ( docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA)) and a DHA-derived specialized pro-resolving lipid mediator ( MaR1) is able to reverse cognitive deficits in the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 ( SAMP8) mouse model of sporadic AD. The novel object recognition test ( NORT) test showed that recognition memory was significantly impaired in SAMP8 mice , as shown by a significantly decreased discrimination index that was reversed by MaR1 and DHA. In the retention phase of the Morris water maze ( MWM) task , SAMP8 mice showed memory deficit that only DHA treatment was able to reverse. pJNK levels were significantly increased in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice compared to SAMR1 mice , and only DHA treatment was able to significantly reverse these increased pJNK levels. Similar results were found when measuring c-Jun , the main JNK substrate. Consequently to the increases in tau phosphorylation after increased pJNK , it was checked that tau phosphorylation ( PHF-1) was increased in SAMP mice , and this effect was reversed after DHA treatment. Altogether , DHA could represent a new approach for the treatment of AD through JNK inhibition.
