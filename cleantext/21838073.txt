  Introduction Practice management and health policy have generally not been considered integral to orthopaedic resident education. Our objective was to evaluate residents ' current experience and knowledge , formal training , and desire for further education in practice management and health policy. Methods We developed a 29-question survey that was divided into three sections: practice management , initial employment opportunity , and health policy. Within each section , questions were directed at a resident 's current experience and knowledge , formal training , and interest in further education. The survey was distributed at the end of the academic year through an Internet-based survey tool ( www.surveymonkey.com) to orthopaedic residents representing multiple programs and all postgraduate years. Results The survey was distributed to 121 residents representing eight residency programs. Of those , 87 residents responded , resulting in a 72 % response rate. All postgraduate years were represented. Regarding practice management , 66 % had `` no confidence '' or `` some confidence '' in coding clinical encounters. When asked if practice models , finance management , and coding should be taught in residency , 95 % , 93 % , and 97 % responded `` yes , '' respectively. When evaluating first employment opportunities , the three most important factors were location , operating room block time , and call. Regarding health policy , 28 % were `` moderately familiar '' or `` very familiar '' with the Physician Payments Sunshine Act , and 72 % were `` not familiar '' or `` somewhat familiar '' with bundled payments for arthroplasty. Finally , when asked if yearly lectures in political activities would enhance resident education , 90 % responded `` yes. '' Discussion and conclusion Regarding practice management , the survey suggests that current orthopaedic residents are not familiar with basic topics , do not receive formal training , and want further education. The survey suggests that residents also receive minimal training in health policy. Residents feel that health policy will be important in their careers , and they would benefit from formal training in residency.
