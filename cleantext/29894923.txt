  Videos are acceptable as evidence in the court of law , provided its authenticity and integrity are scientifically validated. Videos recorded by surveillance systems are susceptible to malicious alterations of visual content by perpetrators locally or remotely. Such malicious alterations of video contents ( called video forgeries) are categorized into inter-frame and intra-frame forgeries. In this paper , we propose inter-frame forgery detection techniques using tamper traces from spatio-temporal and compressed domains. Pristine videos containing frames that are recorded during sudden camera zooming event , may get wrongly classified as tampered videos leading to an increase in false positives. To address this issue , we propose a method for zooming detection and it is incorporated in video tampering detection. Frame shuffling detection , which was not explored so far is also addressed in our work. Our method is capable of differentiating various inter-frame tamper events and its localization in the temporal domain. The proposed system is tested on 23,586 videos of which 2346 are pristine and rest of them are candidates of inter-frame forged videos. Experimental results show that we have successfully detected frame shuffling with encouraging accuracy rates. We have achieved improved accuracy on forgery detection in frame insertion , frame deletion and frame duplication.
