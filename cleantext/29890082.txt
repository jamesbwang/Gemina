  Cesium lead halide perovskite nanowires have emerged as promising low-dimensional semiconductor structures for integrated photonic applications. Understanding light-matter interactions in a nanowire cavity is of both fundamental and practical interest in designing low-power-consumption nanoscale light sources. In this work , high-quality in-plane aligned halide perovskite CsPbX
