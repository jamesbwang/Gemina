  Forkhead box P3 ( FOXP3) is a specific marker for regulatory T-cells ( Tregs). We report 6 cases of T-cell lymphomas with Treg phenotype based on diffuse positivity for FOXP3 in tumor cells. The patients showed a median age of 56 years with a male predominance. Sites of disease included lymph nodes ( 4) , skin ( 2) , subcutaneous tissue ( 1) and bone<disease> marrow ( 1). All cases showed monomorphic large cells , some with Hodgkin-like or anaplastic cells. All cases expressed pan T cell markers and lacked cytotoxic markers; one case showed diffuse PD1 staining. Only one case harbored human T-lymphotrophic virus ( HTLV) -1 DNA within tumor cells and was classified as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATLL). Among 5 HTLV1-negative cases , 3 were classified as peripheral T-cell lymphoma , not otherwise specified ( PTCL , NOS) and 2 fulfilled criteria for ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL) with diffuse and strong CD30 positivity. We concluded that Treg phenotype may be rarely seen in HTLV1-negative cases , such as PTCL , NOS and ALK-negative ALCL. Our findings expand the spectrum of T-cell lymphomas with regulatory phenotype and suggest that consideration should be given to HTLV1 DNA testing in the appropriate clinical setting to rule out ATLL.
