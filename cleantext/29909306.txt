  A pesticide monitoring study including 80 and 60 active ingredients ( in surface waters and sediments , respectively) was carried out in a river basin in Costa Rica during 2007-2012. A special emphasis was given on the exceptional ecological conditions of the tropical agro-ecosystem and the pesticide application strategies in order to establish a reliable monitoring network. A total of 135 water samples and 129 sediment samples were collected and analyzed. Long-term aquatic ecotoxicological risk assessment based on risk quotient in three trophic levels was conducted. Short-term risk assessment was used to calculate the toxic unit and prioritization of sampling sites was conducted by the sum of toxic units in both aquatic and sediment compartments. Dimethoate ( 61.2 μg/L) , propanil ( 30.6 μg/L) , diuron ( 22.8 μg/L) and terbutryn ( 4.8 μg/L) were detected at the highest concentrations in water samples. Carbendazim and endosulfan were the most frequently detected pesticides in water and sediment samples , respectively. Triazophos ( 491 μg/kg) , cypermethrin ( 71.5 μg/kg) , permethrin ( 47.8 μg/kg) , terbutryn ( 38.7 μg/kg) , chlorpyrifos ( 18.2 μg/kg) and diuron ( 11.75 μg/kg) were detected at the highest concentrations in sediment samples. The pesticides carbendazim , diuron , endosulfan , epoxyconazole , propanil , triazophos and terbutryn showed non-acceptable risk even when a conservative scenario was considered. Sum TU Exceptional ecological conditions of the tropical agro-ecosystem affect the fate of pesticides in water and sediment environment differently than the temperate one.
