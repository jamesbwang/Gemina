  Hypercalcemia presenting in ovarian cancer is uncommon in the clinic. Here , two cases of ovarian epithelial carcinoma that presented with severe hypercalcemia were reported , with a review of the literature. The laboratory findings and stepwise clinical investigations of these two cases differed , indicating distinct underlying causes of hypercalcemia. In case one , the serum levels and immunostaining for parathyroid hormone-related protein ( PTHrP) verified humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy ( HHM). In case two , the high level of parathyroid hormone ( PTH) and the scintigraphy scan showing parathyroid gland adenoma confirmed primary hyperparathyroidism-induced hypercalcemia. Both patients received optimal cytoreductive operation and adjuvant chemotherapy but showed different outcomes respectively. This article focused on differential diagnosis of ovarian cancer-associated hypercalcemia , by stepwise imaging and laboratory investigation , and the appropriate therapy should be considered based on the different etiologies.
