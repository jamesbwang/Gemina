  The purpose of this study was to examine , on a national level , nursing students ' perceptions after experiencing a patient death. Death is a highly stressful experience for nursing students. Debriefing , which routinely occurs with a patient 's demise in the simulation setting , typically does not happen in actual death situations. A mixed-methods design using quantitative and qualitative questions as part of an anonymous survey was sent to the membership of the National Student Nurses ' Association. Of approximately 55,000 members , 2,480 responded to the survey. Experiencing a patient death as a student occurred for 41 percent of participants in the nationally representative sample. Of those who experienced a patient death , 64 percent did not receive any debriefing. Most nursing students did not feel prepared to care for a dying patient and the patient 's family. Students need and want more education on end-of-life nursing care.
