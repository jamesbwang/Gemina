  Acute pulmonary thromboembolism ( APTE) is a highly prevalent condition ( 104-183 cases per 100,000 person-years) and is potentially fatal. Approximately 20 % of patients with APTE are hypotensive , being considered at high risk of death. In such patients , immediate lung reperfusion is necessary in order to reduce right ventricular afterload and to restore hemodynamic stability. To reduce pulmonary vascular resistance in APTE and , consequently , to improve right ventricular function , lung reperfusion strategies have been developed over time and widely studied in recent years. In this review , we focus on advances in the indication and use of systemic thrombolytic agents , as well as lung reperfusion via endovascular and classical surgical approaches , in APTE.
