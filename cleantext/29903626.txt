  In the last two decades years , several interventions have been designed for people with major psychological disorders that all have `` metacognitive '' in their name: Metacognitive Therapy ( MCT) , Metacognitive Training ( e.g. , for people with psychosis) and Metacognitive Reflection and Insight Therapy ( MERIT). Two of these interventions are primarily targeted at patients with schizophrenia. Prompted by a recent discussion about what constitutes `` true '' metacognitive treatment , we will first explore the original concept of metacognition as defined by James H. Flavell. Then , we will describe each approach in detail before highlighting how each intervention picks up on slightly different aspects of Flavell 's original metacognitive construct. We will also discuss inherent problems with the label `` metacognition. ''
