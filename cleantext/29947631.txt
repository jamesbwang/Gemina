  With the advantages of facile one-pot synthesis and THF-irrigating purification , we first developed novel cyclic compounds with deep blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence ( TADF) and room-temperature phosphorescence ( RTP) dual emission even in the as-spun films. Careful crystal analysis , combined with theoretical calculations , reveal that abundant inter- and intra-molecular interactions , whatsoever the molecular packing , are obligated to unique RTP properties. These results open up a new study of compounds with multiple acceptors and donors , and represent an important step in the further development of deep blue TADF and easy RTP emission.
