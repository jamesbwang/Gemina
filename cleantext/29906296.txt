  Here we report the industrial pollution effects due to cadmium on the reproductive health of Mytilus galloprovincialis. Mussels were removed from the biofouling of a Conatex panel after one year exposition at a polluted site near a disposal metallurgical factory. A high cadmium bioaccumulation was observed in the testis of mussels housed at the polluted site , with respect to a control site , as determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry , along with a 10 fold increase in metallothionein 20 kDa gene ( mt20) expression levels determined by qPCR. Furthermore , mussels transferred into laboratory tanks from the reference site , and exposed to 1.5 , 5 and 10 ÂµM CdCl
