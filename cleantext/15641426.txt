  Studies of the neural substrates of semantic ( word meaning) processing have typically focused on semantic manipulations , with less consideration for potential differences in difficulty across conditions. While the idea that particular brain regions can support multiple functions is widely accepted , studies of specific cognitive domains rarely test for co-location with other functions. Here we start with standard univariate analyses comparing words to meaningless nonwords , replicating our recent finding that this contrast can activate task-positive regions for words , and default-mode regions in the putative semantic network for nonwords , pointing to difficulty effects. Critically , this was followed up with a multivariate analysis to test whether the same areas activated for meaningless nonwords contained semantic information sufficient to distinguish high- from low-imageability words. Indeed , this classification was performed reliably better than chance at 75 % accuracy. This is compatible with two non-exclusive interpretations. Numerous areas in the default-mode network are task-negative in the sense of activating for less demanding conditions , and the same areas contain information supporting semantic cognition. Therefore , while areas of the default mode network have been hypothesized to support semantic cognition , we offer evidence that these areas can respond to both domain-general difficulty effects , and to specific aspects of semantics.
