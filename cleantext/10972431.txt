  Despite the national roll-out of free HIV<pathogen> medicines in Uganda and other sub-Saharan African countries , many HIV<pathogen> positive patients on antiretroviral therapy ( ART) are at risk of non-adherence due to poverty and other structural and health system related constraints. However , several patients exhibit resilience by attaining and sustaining high levels of adherence amid adversity. Social capital , defined as resources embedded within social networks , is key in facilitating resilience but the mechanism through which it operates remains understudied. This article provides insights into mechanisms through which social capital enables patients on ART in a resource-poor setting to overcome risk and sustain adherence to treatment. The article draws from an ethnographic study of 50 adult male and female HIV<pathogen> patients enrolled at two treatment sites in Uganda , 15 of whom were followed-up for an extended period of six months for narrative interviews and observation. The patients were selected purposively on the basis of socio-demographic and treatment related criteria. Social capital protects patients on ART against the risk of non-adherence in three ways. 1) It facilitates access to scarce resources; 2) encourages HIV<pathogen> patients to continue on treatment; and 3) averts risk for non-adherence. Social capital is a key resource that can be harnessed to promote resilience among HIV<pathogen> patients in a resource-limited setting amid individual , structural and health system related barriers to ART adherence. Invigoration and maintenance of collectivist norms may however be necessary if its protective benefits are to be fully realized.
