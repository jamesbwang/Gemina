  This study seeks to better understand the human-nature interface and to measure the variability of plant use knowledge among cultures , through inter- and intracultural analyses. We compared plant collection , use , and management of two culturally distinct groups ( Baitadi and Darchula) of the Nepal Himalaya. They inhabit different physiographic regions , yet share the same ecological landscape , environmental resources , and livelihood challenges. We hypothesized that the elderly , native , and traditional healers living in remote and rural places possess more diverse and detailed knowledge of plant use and conservation than young , non-native , and non-healers. A total of 106 people were contacted for interviews , and 100 ( 68 men and 32 women) agreed to share ethnobotanical , demographic , and socioeconomic information. They were asked about the three most important plants for their socioeconomic benefit , culture , primary health care , and livelihood. The knowledge of plant collection , use , and its transfer was strongly associated with the cultural heritage whereas the ecogeographical condition influences the ways in which plants are collected and used. The divergent knowledge of plant collection , use , and transfer between the participants of Baitadi and Darchula was significantly ( p < 0.001) attributed to the cultural heritage of the area. The low consensus of plant use ( FiC 0-0.87; IASc 0-0.67) between Baitadi and Darchula district could be due to cultural divergence , varied accessibility , physiographic heterogeneity , and biodiversity uniqueness. Differences in plant use knowledge may help in diversifying the strategies of plant use in accordance with the livelihood , culture , and environment , and therefore , more studies measuring these aspects can further the ecosystem and cultural health of the region.
