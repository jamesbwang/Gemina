  In arson attacks the detection of ignitable liquid residues ( ILRs) at fire scenes provides key evidence since ignitable liquids , such as gasoline , are commonly used to initiate the fire. In most forensic laboratories gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is employed for the analysis of ILRs. When a fire occurs , suppression agents are used to extinguish the fire and , before the scene is investigated , the samples at the scene are subjected to a variety of processes such as weathering , which can significantly modify the chemical composition and thus lead to erroneous conclusions. In order to avoid this possibility , the application of chemometric tools that help the analyst to extract useful information from data is very advantageous. The study described here concerned the application of a headspace-mass spectrometry electronic nose ( HS-MS eNose) combined with chemometric tools to determine the presence/absence of gasoline in weathered fire debris samples. The effect of applying two suppression agents ( Cafoam Aquafoam AF-6 and Pyro-chem PK-80 Powder) and delays in the sampling time ( from 0 to 48 h) were studied. It was found that , although the suppression systems affect the mass spectra , the HS-MS eNose in combination with suitable pattern recognition chemometric tools , such as linear discriminant analysis , is able to identify the presence of gasoline in any of the studied situations ( 100 % correct classification).
