  Carbonate formation in waste from the steel industry could constitute a nontrivial proportion of the global requirements for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a potentially low cost. To utilize this potential , we examined atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration in a > 20 million ton legacy slag deposit in northern England , United Kingdom. Carbonates formed from the drainage water of the heap had stable carbon and oxygen isotope values between -12 and -25 ‰ and -5 and -18 ‰ for δ
