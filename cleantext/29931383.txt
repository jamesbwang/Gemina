  The HerniaSurge guidelines have the highest evidence with respect to a strong recommendation for mesh-based surgical techniques. This evidence is equally valid for the Lichtenstein procedure as for the minimally invasive procedures TEP/TAPP. In the case of discrete symptomatic or asymptomatic inguinal hernias , watchful waiting can be an option , taking into account health status and social circumstances. Femoral hernias , on the other hand , should be treated promptly with mesh insertion. Also favored are laparoendoscopic techniques. The Shouldice repair achieves the least recurrences from the suturing procedures and may be an acceptable alternative when indicated or when the patient does not desire mesh reinforcement. In this case , a detailed patient education is necessary. The complication potential of plastic meshes should be explained. The weight is no longer considered a suitable parameter for the classification of meshes and is no longer recommended for mesh selection. Large pore ( > 1-1.5 mm) monofilament implants have the best integration potential and should have a tear strength of approximately 16 Nm Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in open repair procedures is recommended only in patients with an increased risk of infections. In laparoendoscopic procedures , antibiotic prophylaxis should not be performed or used with the utmost restraint. Careful preparation reduces chronic inguinal and testicular<symptom> pain<symptom>. In the case of interference of mesh and nerve , the nerve can be resected. A return to daily activity is recommended within 3-5 days. The documentation of patient data should be done by establishing hernia registers for quality assurance and for the development of further treatment options. The implementation of the guidelines is supported by HerniaSurge.
