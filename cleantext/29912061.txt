  Low-dose hydrocortisone ( LDH) enhances aspects of learning and memory in select populations including patients with PTSD and HIV-infected men. HIV-infected women show impairments in learning and memory , but the cognitive effects of LDH in HIV-infected women are unknown. Double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over study examining the time-dependent effects of a single low-dose administration of hydrocortisone ( 10 mg oral) on cognition in 36 HIV-infected women. Participants were first randomized to LDH or placebo and then received the opposite treatment one month later. Cognitive performance was assessed 30 minutes and 4 hours after pill administration to assess , respectively nongenomic and genomic effects. Self-reported stress/anxiety and salivary cortisol were assessed throughout sessions. LDH significantly increased salivary cortisol levels versus placebo; levels returned to baseline 4-hours post-administration. At the 30-minute assessment , LDH enhanced verbal learning and delayed memory , working memory , behavioral inhibition , and visuospatial abilities. At the 4-hour assessment , LDH enhanced verbal learning and delayed memory compared to placebo. LDH-induced cognitive benefits related to reductions in cytokines and to a lesser extent to increases in cortisol. The extended benefits from 30 minutes to 4 hours of a single administration of LDH on learning and delayed memory suggest that targeting the HPA axis may have potential clinical utility in HIV-infected women. These findings contrast with our findings in HIV-infected men who showed improved learning only at the 30-minute assessment. Larger , longer-term studies are underway to verify possible cognitive enhancing effects of LDH and the clinical significance of these effects in
