  Risky driving behavior may contribute to the high crash risk among teenage drivers. The current naturalistic driving study assessed predictors for teenagers ' kinematic risky driving ( KRD) behavior and the interdependencies between them. The private vehicles of 81 novice teenage drivers were equipped with data acquisition system that recorded driving kinematics , miles driven , and video recordings of the driver , passengers and the driving environment. Psychosocial measures were collected using questionnaires administered at licensure. Poisson regression analyses and model selection were used to assess factors associated with teens ' risky driving behavior and the interactions between them. Driving own vs shared vehicle , driving during the day vs at night , and driving alone vs with passengers were significantly associated with higher KRD rates ( Incidence rate ratios ( IRRs) of 1.60 , 1.41 , and 1.28 , respectively). Teenagers reporting higher vs lower levels of parental trust had significantly lower KRD rates ( IRR = 0.58). KRD rates were 88 % higher among teenagers driving with a passenger in their own vehicle compared to teenagers driving with a passenger in a shared vehicle. Similarly , KRD rates during the day were 74 % higher among teenagers driving their own vehicle compared to those driving a shared vehicle. Novice teenagers ' risky driving behavior varied according to driver attributes and contextual aspects of the driving environment. As such , examining teenagers ' risky driving behavior should take into account multiple contributing factors and their interactions. The variability in risky driving according to the driving context can inform the development of targeted interventions to reduce the crash risk of novice teenage drivers.
