  Microneedle ( MN) arrays contain a backing plate with multiple microscopic projections to puncture the skin and can be used to deliver drug in a minimally invasive way. Advantages of MNs are numerous including administration of large molecules , avoiding first-pass metabolism , ease of administration , lack of pain , site-specific drug targeting , and dose reduction due to increased absorption efficacy. The growth in the transdermal market has been fueled by an increasing number of chronic<disease> disease<disease> patients and a demand for easy and pain-free drug administration. Areas covered: This paper highlights the use of MNs as a drug delivery system and discusses their potential market impact from a cost perspective. A number of clinical trials have been conducted and are listed to illustrate the potential applications of MNs for therapeutic use. Furthermore , the cosmetic market has made use of the MN technology , indicating that MNs can be used safely , efficaciously , and on a commercial scale. Furthermore , the cost-effectiveness of MNs is discussed. Expert commentary: For MNs to become commercially available for therapeutic use , a number of factors will need to be considered: safety , ease of use , manufacturing and storage , uptake , effectiveness , and regulatory requirements.
