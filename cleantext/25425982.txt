  Leiomyoma of uterine origin is a common histologically benign neoplasm in women; however , growth intravenously with intracardiac extension is a rare phenomenon. This is a diagnostic challenge that can present with varied clinical manifestations and multiple differential diagnosis. This is a case of a 45-year-old female patient with chest heaviness and an intracardiac mass on 2-dimensional ( 2D) echocardiogram. Previous history of hysterectomy was likewise noted. Imaging workup , including 2D echocardiogram and contrast-enhanced chest and abdomen computed tomography scans , was performed which demonstrated a large , heterogeneous , elongated filling defect in the right atrium and right ventricle extending to the inferior vena cava , left renal vein , and left gonadal vein. The diagnosis was made after resection of the tumor in a single-stage operation. The histopathologic and immunoprofile of the resected tumor were consistent with leiomyoma. The use of multiple imaging modalities such as 2D echocardiogram and computed tomography are essential in the investigation of the intracaval masses with intracardiac extension. Although intravenous leiomyoma with intracardiac extension is a rare phenomenon , radiologists and clinicians alike should be mindful of this differential diagnosis.
