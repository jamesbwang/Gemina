  During shoulder surgery in the beach-chair position , head fixation can sometimes cause rare complications. The authors share their experience in treating ocular injury due to improper head fixation during surgery in the beach-chair position. The study investigated consecutively 6075 patients who underwent shoulder surgery in the beach-chair position between March 2007 and March 2016 , those patients who saw an ophthalmologist with a complaint of post-operative ocular discomfort. In the beach-chair position , surgery is performed with the patient 's upper body raised by 70 °. A total of seven patients saw an ophthalmologist due to post-operative ocular discomfort , and a total of five patients ( 0.082 %) had corneal abrasion. Three of these patients underwent arthroscopic surgery , and the other two underwent open surgery. The mean surgery duration for the five patients was 45.0 ± 14.68 minutes. Of these patients , four were male and one was female , and their average age was 46 ± 22.24 years ( range: 18-69 years). All patients complained of unbearable ophthalmodynia immediately after surgery that was not resolved using analgesics. The ophthalmodynia resolved immediately after wearing corneal protective lenses. Unlike typical surgery , when shoulder surgery is performed in the beach-chair position , there is a risk of ocular surface injury due to improper head fixation; one manifestation of this problem is corneal injury. If a severe ophthalmodynia that can not be controlled using analgesics occurs immediately after surgery in the beach-chair position , a corneal injury should be suspected , and the patient should wear a corneal protective lens. Level IV.
