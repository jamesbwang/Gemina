  The mechanisms that connect complement system activation and basal deposit formation in early stages of age-related macular degeneration ( AMD) are insufficiently understood , which complicates the design of efficient therapies to prevent disease progression. Using human fetal ( hf) retinal pigment epithelial ( RPE) cells , we have established an in vitro model to investigate the effect of complement C3a on RPE cells and its role in the formation of sub-RPE deposits. The results of these studies revealed that C3a produced after C3 activation is sufficient to induce the formation of sub-RPE deposits via complement-driven proteasome inhibition. C3a binds the C3a receptor ( C3aR) , stimulates deposition of collagens IV and VI underneath the RPE , and impairs the extracellular matrix ( ECM) turnover by increased MMP-2 activity , all mediated by downregulation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway ( UPP). The formation of basal deposits can be prevented by the addition of a C3aR antagonist , which restores the UPP activity and ECM turnover. These findings indicate that the cell-based model can be used to test potential therapeutic agents in vitro. The data suggest that modulation of C3aR-mediated events could be a therapeutic approach for treatment of early AMD.
