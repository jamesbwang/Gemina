  Doping is an extremely important process where intentional insertion of impurities in semiconductors controls their electronic properties. In organic semiconductors , one of the convenient , but inefficient , ways of doping is the spin casting of a precursor mixture of components in solution , followed by solvent evaporation. Active control over this process holds the key to significant improvements over current poor doping efficiencies. Yet , an optimized control can only come from a detailed understanding of electronic interactions responsible for the low doping efficiencies. Here , we use two-dimensional nonlinear optical spectroscopy to examine these interactions in the course of the doping process by probing the solution mixture of doped organic semiconductors. A dopant accepts an electron from the semiconductor and the two ions form a duplex of interacting charges known as ion-pair complexes. Well-resolved off-diagonal peaks in the two-dimensional spectra clearly demonstrate the electronic connectivity among the ions in solution. This electronic interaction represents a well resolved electrostatically bound state , as opposed to a random distribution of ions. We developed a theoretical model to recover the experimental data , which reveals an unexpectedly strong electronic coupling of âˆ¼ 250 cm
