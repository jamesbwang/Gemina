  The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of resveratrol and regular aerobic exercise on vascular functions and biomarkers related to vessel responsiveness in an age and gender-dependent manner. The study used young ( 3 months) and old ( 12 months) male and female Wistar albino rats. Resveratrol was given in the drinking water ( 0.05 mg/ml; approximately 7.5 mg/kg) for 6 weeks. In the exercise group , all rats performed treadmill running at 20 m/min on a 0 Â° incline , 40 min/day , 3 times a week , for 6 weeks. Acetylcholine-induced , endothelium-dependent and sodium nitroprusside-mediated , endothelium-independent relaxations of rat thoracic aorta and blood levels of biomarkers were separately changed by resveratrol intake and exercise-training in an age and gender-dependent manner. Antioxidant enzymes and eNOS expressions in vessels were elevated by resveratrol and exercise. Resveratrol and exercise enhanced gene expressions of non-selective PDE1 , 2 , 3 and cAMP selective PDE4 but not cGMP selective PDE5 in the aorta. In addition , the aortic mRNA expression of inflammation<symptom> markers were altered by resveratrol and exercise-training. The results of the study demonstrated that vessel responsiveness and biomarkers related to vascular functions were altered by resveratrol consumption and exercise-training in an age and gender-dependent manner.
