  In the downstream process of recombinant hepatitis<disease> B<disease> surface antigen ( rHBsAg) , nano-colloidal silica adsorbent ( Aerosil-380) is one of the possible methods to separate the antigen from other main impurities partially. The current study aimed to maximize the adsorptive capacity of Aerosil-380 as well as rHBsAg recovery for large-scale production of recombinant hepatitis<disease> B<disease> vaccine. The experimental design methodology was used to optimize the eight critical parameters influencing the efficiency , rHBsAg recovery , of the adsorption-desorption process in the lab-scale. These examined parameters were the adsorption-desorption temperature , pH , contact time , agitation speed , antigen concentration , and desorption buffer. Under optimal condition , the maximum adsorption capacity of Aerosil-380 was equal to 3333 Î¼g.g
