  To explore the preventive effect of applying hot compress with Chinese herbal salt packets ( CHSP) to puncture vessels under aseptic conditions during peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICC) on postoperative phlebitis. A total of 720 hospitalized patients undergoing first PICC were assigned to treatment and control groups ( 360 cases each group) according to a random number table. The control group received conventional catheterization and nursing care. The treatment group was first given hot compress with CHSP ( which consisted of honeysuckle 30 g , Semen brassicae 30 g , Salvia miltiorrhiza 30 g , Angelica dahurica 30 g , Semen raphani 30 g , Evodia rutaecarpa 30 g , and coarse salt 20 g) on the punctured vessel under aseptic conditions for 5-10 min before conventional catheterization. The main efficacy indices were the vessel diameters before and during catheterization and the success rate of a single catheter , and the secondary efficacy indiex was the incidence of superficial phlebitis within 1 week after catheterization. The vessel diameter during catheterization of the treatment group was remarkably increased compared with the control group ( ( 7.96 ± 0.42) mm vs. ( 4.39 ± 0.54) mm , P < 0.01). The success rate of the single catheter of the treatment group was significantly higher than that of the control group ( 94.00 % ( 329/350) vs. 73.72 % ( 244/329) , P < 0.01). The incidence of superficial phlebitis within 1 week after catheterization in the treatment group was lower than that in the control group ( P = 0.007). There was no adverse event with CHSP. Hot compress with CHSP during PICC is applicable as it can effectively improve the success rate of a single catheter and reduce the incidence of superficial phlebitis after catheterization ( Trial registration No. ChiCTR-ONC-17010498).
