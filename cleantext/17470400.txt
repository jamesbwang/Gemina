  This study aimed to examine the effects of SRT1720 , a potent SIRT1 activator , on osteoarthritis ( OA) progression using an experimental OA model. Osteoarthritis was surgically induced by destabilization of the medial meniscus in eight-week-old C57BL/6 male mice. SRT1720 was administered intraperitoneally twice a week after surgery. Osteoarthritis progression was evaluated histologically using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International ( OARSI) score at four , eight , 12 and 16 weeks. The expression of SIRT1 , matrix metalloproteinase 13 ( MMP-13) , a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-5 ( ADAMTS-5) , cleaved caspase-3 , PARP p85 , and acetylated nuclear factor ( NF)- κB p65 in cartilage was examined by immunohistochemistry. Synovitis<symptom> was also evaluated histologically. Primary mouse epiphyseal chondrocytes were treated with SRT1720 in the presence or absence of interleukin 1 beta ( IL-1β) , and gene expression changes were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR). The OARSI score was signiﬁcantly lower in mice treated with SRT1720 than in control mice at eight and 12 weeks associated with the decreased size of osteophytes at four and eight weeks. The delayed OA progression in the mice treated with SRT1720 was also associated with increased SIRT1-positive chondrocytes and decreased MMP-13- , ADAMTS-5- , cleaved caspase-3- , PARP p85- , and acetylated NF-κB p65-positive chondrocytes and decreased synovitis<symptom> at four and eight weeks. SRT1720 treatment partially rescued the decreases in collagen type II alpha 1 ( COL2A1) and aggrecan caused by IL-1β , while also reducing the induction of MMP-13 by IL-1β The intraperitoneal injection of SRT1720 attenuated experimental OA progression in mice , indicating that SRT1720 could be a new therapeutic approach for OA.Cite this article: K.
