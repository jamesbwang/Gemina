  The primary aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility of the recalled preoperative Oxford Hip Score ( OHS) and Oxford Knee Score ( OKS) one year following arthroplasty for a cohort of patients. The secondary aim was to assess the reliability of a patient 's recollection of their own preoperative OHS and OKS one year following surgery. A total of 335 patients ( mean age 72.5; 22 to 92; 53.7 % female) undergoing total hip arthroplasty ( n = 178) and total knee arthroplasty ( n = 157) were prospectively assessed. Patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty completed an OHS or OKS , respectively , preoperatively and were asked to recall their preoperative condition while completing the same score one year after surgery. A mean difference of 0.04 points ( 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) -15.64 to 15.72 , p = 0.97) between the actual and the recalled OHS was observed. The mean difference in the OKS was 1.59 points ( 95 % CI -11.57 to 14.75 , p = 0.10). There was excellent reliability for the ` average measures ' intra-class correlation for both the OHS ( r = 0.802) and the OKS ( r = 0.772). However , this reliability was diminished for the individuals OHS ( r = 0.670) and OKS ( r = 0.629) using single measures intra-class correlation. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated wide variation in the individual patient 's ability to recall their preoperative score ( 95 % CI ± 16 for OHS , 95 % CI ± 13 for OKS). Prospective preoperative collection of OHS and OKS remains the benchmark. Using recalled scores one year following hip and knee arthroplasty is an alternative when used to assess a cohort of patients. However , the recall of an individual patient 's preoperative score should not be relied upon due to the diminished reliability and wide CI.
