  RNA footprinting by hydroxyl radical cleavage provides ` snapshots ' of RNA tertiary structure or protein interactions that bury the RNA backbone. Generation of hydroxyl radicals with a high-flux synchrotron X-ray beam provides analysis on a short timescale ( 5-100 msec) , which enables the structures of folding intermediates or other transient conformational states to be determined in biochemical solutions or cells. This article provides protocols for using synchrotron beamlines for hydroxyl radical footprinting. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
