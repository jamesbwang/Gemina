  The circadian clock coordinates behavioral and circadian cues with availability and utilization of nutrients. Proteasomal degradation of clock repressors , such as cryptochrome ( CRY) 1 , maintains periodicity. Whether macroautophagy , a quality control pathway , degrades circadian proteins remains unknown. Here we show that circadian proteins BMAL1 , CLOCK , REV-ERBÎ± , and CRY1 are lysosomal targets , and that macroautophagy affects the circadian clock by selectively degrading CRY1. Autophagic degradation of CRY1 , an inhibitor of gluconeogenesis , occurs in a diurnal window when rodents rely on gluconeogenesis , suggesting that CRY1 degradation is time-imprinted to maintenance of blood glucose. High-fat feeding accelerates autophagic CRY1 degradation and contributes to obesity-associated hyperglycemia. CRY1 contains several light chain 3 ( LC3)- interacting region ( LIR) motifs , which facilitate the interaction of cargo proteins with the autophagosome marker LC3. Using mutational analyses , we identified two distinct LIRs on CRY1 that exert circadian glycemic control by regulating CRY1 degradation , revealing LIRs as potential targets for controlling hyperglycemia.
