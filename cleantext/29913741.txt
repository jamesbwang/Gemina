  Objective Earlier epidemiological studies have shown that headaches<symptom> are frequent among adolescents , especially girls. In particular , recurrent primary headache<symptom> disorders such as migraine and tension-type headaches<symptom> are common complaints in this age group. Headaches<symptom> are increasingly being recognized as a significant health problem in adolescents and can lead to significant disabilities by affecting their lives , their school performance and their social lives. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of primary headaches<symptom> among adolescents aged 16-20 years in Norway in two periods. Very few replicate studies have re-evaluated the prevalence of primary headaches<symptom> in this age range and it is uncertain whether the prevalence is increasing. Methods Two cross-sectional , population-based studies were conducted in Norway from 1995 to 1997 ( Young-HUNT 1) and from 1999 to 2001 ( Young-HUNT 2). In Young-HUNT 1 , 2594 adolescents in 2nd and 3rd grade in upper secondary school ( aged 16-20 years) completed a comprehensive questionnaire including one question regarding headache<symptom> during the last 12 months. In addition , 1730 of the students were interviewed about their headache<symptom> complaints. In Young-HUNT 2 , 2373 adolescents aged 16-20 years completed the same questionnaire and 1655 were interviewed in the same way as the earlier survey. The interviews were performed by trained nurses , and respondents were asked if they had experienced recurrent headache<symptom> during the last year. If so , the headache<symptom> was classified as migraine ( MI) , tensiontype headache<symptom> ( TTH) or non-classifiable headache<symptom> ( NCH). Headache<symptom> frequency during the past year was recorded according to the following categories: Less than 1 day per month ( less than monthly) , 1-3 days per month ( monthly) , 1-5 days per week ( weekly) , or more than 5 days per week ( daily). Results The participation rate was 88 % in Young-HUNT 1 and 81 % in Young-HUNT 2. The overall prevalence of having had headaches<symptom> during the last 12 months did not change significantly ( 79.4 % versus 77.5 %; OR: 0.89 , 95 % CI: 0.79-1.02 , p = 0.09) , whereas the prevalence of recurrent headaches<symptom> increased from 30.3 % in Young-HUNT 1 to 35.4 % in Young-HUNT 2 ( OR: 1.26 , 95 % CI: 1.09-1.46 , p = 0.002). The prevalence of tension-type headache<symptom> changed significantly from 19.0 % to 21.9 % ( OR: 1.20 , 95 % CI: 1.02-1.42 , p = 0.03). Also the prevalence of migraine tended to increase ( 7.5 % versus 8.7 % , OR: 1.18 , 95 % CI: 0.92-1.52 , p = 0.18). The overall frequency of recurrent headache<symptom> changed towards more monthly and less weekly headache<symptom> Conclusions This is the first large-scale population-based study among adolescents in Norway assessing changes in the prevalence of primary headaches<symptom> over a four-year period of time. The overall prevalence of recurrent headaches<symptom> increased significantly from Young-HUNT 1 to Young-HUNT 2. An increase was seen in all types of recurrent headaches<symptom> and was significant for tension-type headache<symptom> Implications Earlier follow-up studies have examined changes in prevalence of recurrent headaches<symptom> in young age , but the results are diverging. Our findings support the impression that the prevalence of recurrent headache<symptom> among adolescents is increasing , and underlines the need for prospective designed studies with emphasis on prognosis and etiological factors.
