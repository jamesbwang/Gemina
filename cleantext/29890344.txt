  Less attention to a balance<symptom> task reduces the center of foot pressure ( COP) variability by automating the task. However , it is not fully understood how the degree of postural automaticity influences the voluntary movement and anticipatory postural adjustments. Eleven healthy young adults performed a bipedal , eyes closed standing task under the three conditions: Control ( C , standing task) , Single ( S , standing + reaction tasks) , and Dual ( D , standing + reaction + mental tasks). The reaction task was flexing the right shoulder to an auditory stimulus , which causes counter-clockwise rotational torque , and the mental task was arithmetic task. The COP variance before the reaction task was reduced in the D condition compared to that in the C and S conditions. On average the onsets<symptom> of the arm movement and the vertical torque ( Tz , anticipatory clockwise rotational torque) were both delayed , and the maximal Tz slope ( the rate at which the torque develops) became less steep in the D condition compared to those in the S condition. When these data in the D condition were expressed as a percentage of those in the S condition , the arm movement onset and the Tz slope were positively and negatively , respectively , correlated with the COP variance. By using the mental-task induced COP variance reduction as the indicator of postural automaticity , our data suggest that the balance<symptom> task for those with more COP variance reduction is less cognitively demanding , leading to the shorter reaction time probably due to the attention shift from the automated balance<symptom> task to the reaction task.
