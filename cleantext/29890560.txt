  Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancer diseases. For years , gemcitabine has been the standard of care and the only therapeutic option in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Within the last years , new combination therapies have been established for first-line treatment , which significantly improve overall survival in comparison to gemcitabine monotherapy.
