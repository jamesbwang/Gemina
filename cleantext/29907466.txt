  The major burden of sudden cardiac death ( SCD) in patients with heart disease occurs in those with a left ventricular ejection fraction > 40 %. Although the annual risk of SCD may be lower in these patients compared to those with lower LVEF , their lifetime cumulative risk of SCD may be greater due to a better overall prognosis. It is plausible that those with LVEF > 40 % who are at highest risk of life-threatening arrhythmia will benefit from implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Features that identify patients with a LVEF > 40 % at high risk of SCD are urgently needed. We review existing studies examining SCD markers in this sub-group and discuss gaps in the current evidence base.
