  Advanced renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) results in over 14,000 deaths each year in the United States alone. The therapeutic landscape for advanced RCC changed dramatically with the approval of tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKI) between 2006 and 2012. A large-scale analysis of survival trends has not been performed in the TKI era to determine their impact on outcomes for advanced RCC patients. The Surveillance , Epidemiology and End-Results ( SEER) database was queried for adult patients with advanced RCC diagnosed between 2000 and 2013. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on the year of diagnosis-pre-TKI cohort ( 2000-2006) and TKI cohort ( 2007-2013). Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed. A total of 14,976 patients were included in our study. Median age at diagnosis was 64 years ( range , 18-89 years). Median ( cancer-specific) overall survival was 10.0 months in the TKI cohort compared with 8.0 months in the pre-TKI cohort , corresponding to a 13 % improvement in survival in the TKI area ( hazard ratio ( HR) for death 0.87; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.84-0.91 , P < 0.0001). Median survival was improved by 2 months for patients with clear-cell RCC histology ( HR for death 0.86; 95 % CI , 0.84-0.91 , P < 0.0001). Patients with non-clear cell RCC had a 25 % higher risk of mortality compared with those with clear-cell RCC. Additionally , median survival for non-clear cell RCC patients was not statistically different between the two cohorts ( HR for death 0.98; 95 % CI , 0.88-1.09 , P = 0.714). Subgroup analysis showed that elderly patients ( age 71 years and above) had a 45 % higher risk of death from advanced RCC compared with young patients ( aged 18-50 years) ( HR for death 1.45; 95 % CI , 1.36-1.54 , P < 0.0001). Gender and racial disparities in outcomes were also noted with women having a 10 % higher risk of death compared with men ( HR for death 1.10; 95 % CI , 1.06-1.14 , P < 0.001) and Black patients having a 15 % higher risk of death compared with White patients ( HR for death 1.15; 95 % CI , 1.08-1.23 , P < 0.0001). Our study provides a largest registry-based analysis of survival outcomes in the TKI era. In majority of patients , the survival has improved significantly with the advent of TKIs as standard of care therapy. Survival for patients with non-clear cell RCC is clearly worse than clear-cell RCC and does not appear to have changed with TKIs. Elderly patients , women , and Black patients appear to have worse outcomes and these disparities merit further investigation.
