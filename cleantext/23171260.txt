  Adverse surgical incidents affect both patients and health professionals. This study sought to explore the effect of surgical incidents on operating theatre staff and their subsequent behaviours. Eligible studies were primary research or reviews that focused on the effect of incidents on operating theatre staff in primary , secondary or tertiary care settings. MEDLINE , Embase , CINALH and PsycINFO were searched. A data extraction form was used to capture pertinent information from included studies and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme ( CASP) tool to appraise their quality. PRISMA-P reporting guidelines were followed and the review is registered with PROSPERO. A total of 3918 articles were identified , with 667 duplicates removed and 3230 excluded at the title , abstract and full-text stages. Of 21 included articles , eight focused on the impact of surgical incidents on surgeons and anaesthetists. Only two involved theatre nurses and theatre technicians. Five key themes emerged: the emotional impact on health professionals , organization culture and support , individual coping strategies , learning from surgical complications and recommended changes to practice. Health professionals suffered emotional distress and often changed their behaviour following a surgical incident. Both organizations and individual clinicians can do a great deal to support staff in the aftermath of serious incidents.
