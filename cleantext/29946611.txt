  The synthesis of a heterodinucleating ligand LH2 ( LH2 = ( E) -3- ( ( ( 2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethyl-5- ( ( pyridin-2-ylmethylene) amino) -9 H-xanthen-4-yl) amino) methyl) benzene-1,2-diol) was undertaken toward a functional model of the bimetallic active site found in Mo-Cu carbon monoxide dehydrogenase ( Mo-Cu CODH) , and to understand the origins of heterobimetallic cooperativity exhibited by the enzyme. LH2 features a hard potentially dianionic catechol chelate for binding Mo ( vi) and a soft iminopyridine chelate for binding Cu ( i). Treatment of LH2 with either Cu ( i) or M ( vi) ( M = Mo , W) sources leads to the anticipated site-selective incorporation of the respective metals. While both ( CuI ( LH2)) + and ( MVIO3 ( L)) 2- complexes are stable in the solid state , ( MVIO3 ( L)) 2- complexes disproportionate in solution to give ( MVIO2 ( L) 2) ( NEt4) 2 complexes , with ( MVIO4) 2- as the by-product. The incorporation of BOTH Mo ( vi) and Cu ( i) into L forms a highly reactive heterobimetallic complex ( MoVIO3CuI ( L)) ( NEt4) 2 , whose formation and reactivity was interrogated via1H NMR/UV-vis spectroscopy and DFT calculations. These studies reveal that the combination of the two metals triggers oxidation reactivity , in which a nucleophilic Mo ( vi) trioxo attacks Cu ( i)- bound imine. The major product of the reaction is a crystallographically characterized molybdenum ( vi) complex<pathogen> ( Mo ( L') O2) ( NEt4) coordinated by a modified ligand L' that contains a new C-O bond in place of the imine functionality. This observed hydroxylation reactivity is consistent with the postulated first step of Mo-Cu CODH ( nucleophilic attack of the Mo ( vi)- oxo on the Cu ( i)- bound electrophilic CO) and xanthine oxidoreductase ( nucleophilic attack of Mo ( vi)- oxo on the electrophilic xanthine carbon).
