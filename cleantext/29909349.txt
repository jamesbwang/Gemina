  We proposed an integration hypothesis of mind wandering in which the tendency of mind wandering is only related to working memory capacity ( WMC) when a self-regulation process is required ( i.e. , under a high task load); however , this tendency is related to mindfulness regardless of task load. A within-group experiment with 160 participants was conducted. Task load was manipulated as high or low using modified 0-back and 2-back tasks , during which participants ' self-caught mind wanderings and the types of mind wandering ( aware vs. unaware; intentional vs. unintentional) were measured. The results supported our hypothesis that WMC was negatively associated with mind wandering only in demanding tasks , and mindfulness scores were negatively associated with mind wandering across tasks. Furthermore , we also determined how WMC and the mindfulness trait were related to different types of mind wandering. Theoretical implications were discussed.
