  The sulfilimine bond (- S ‚ïê N-) , found in the collagen IV scaffold , significantly stabilizes the architecture via the formation of sulfilimine cross-links. However , precisely governing the formation and breakup process of the sulfilimine bond in living organisms for better life functions still remains a challenge. Hence , we established a new way to regulate the breaking and formation of the sulfilimine bond through hydrogen selenide ( H
