  Papaverine hydrochloride loaded gels , films and electrospun fibers were prepared for buccal drug delivery with the aim of improving the oral bioavailability of the crystalline drug , which can be achieved by the increased solubility and by the circumvention of the intensive first pass metabolism. The water soluble hydroxypropyl cellulose ( HPC) was chosen as a mucoadhesive polymer. In order to improve the electrospinnability of HPC , the similarly mucoadhesive poly ( vinyl alcohol) ( PVA) was used. Since the drying of gels is of decisive role in either the formation of drug-loaded cast films or electrospun fibers , a real time ortho-positronium ( o-Ps) tracking of gels was applied in order to obtain information about the supramolecular changes of the drying-induced gel-film transition. An anomalous increase of o-Ps lifetime value in the gel-film transition region was observed which refers to the remaining intramolecularly bound water in the drug-loaded polymeric gel matrix. The latter could provide information about the characteristics of polymer-water interactions in the phase transition , consequently the storage stability of the formulated solid system.
