  ( Purpose) To investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on rehabilitation outcomes and balance<symptom> in patients having hemiplegia due to ischemic stroke. ( Subjects and Methods) Vitamin D levels of 132 patients hospitalized for hemiplegia rehabilitation due to ischemic stroke were tested. Consequently , 86/132 patients had low vitamin D levels , 72 of which met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: Group A ( injected with 300,000 IU vitamin D) , and Group B ( injected intramuscularly with saline). Each patient was tested at the baseline and at the third month using the Brunnstrom recovery staging , functional ambulation scale , modified Barthel index , and Berg balance<symptom> scale. The findings were compared between the groups. ( Results) By the end of the third month , The Berg balance<symptom> scale results and modified Barthel index scores significantly differed between the two groups , whereas Brunnstrom recovery staging and functional ambulation scale test results did not. ( Conclusion) This study found that vitamin D administration increased the activity levels and accelerated balance<symptom> recovery but did not significantly affect ambulation or motor recovery. These results warrant confirmation by longer follow-up studies with a larger number of participants.
