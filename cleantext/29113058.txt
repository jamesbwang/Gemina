  L-shaped bolt lap joints are commonly used in aerospace and civil structures. However , bolt joints are frequently subjected to loosening , and this has a significant effect on the safety and reliability of these structures. Therefore , bolt preload monitoring is very important , especially at the early stage of loosening. In this paper , a virtual time reversal guided wave method is presented to monitor preload of bolted L-shaped lap joints accurately and simply. In this method , a referenced reemitting signal ( RRS) is extracted from the bolted structure in fully tightened condition. Then the RRS is utilized as the excitation signal for the bolted structure in loosening states , and the normalized peak amplitude of refocused wave packet is used as the tightness index ( TI
