  Diabetic nephropathy is one of the serious complications of diabetes mellitus. Visfatin is an intracellular enzyme with insulin-mimicking effects. It enhances the expression of endothelial nitric oxide ( NO) synthase in renal cells. This study aimed to investigate serum levels of visfatin and NO metabolites in patients with diabetic nephropathy. A total of 80 diabetic patients were enrolled and classified into nephropathic and non-nephropathic patients. Serum visfatin and insulin levels were estimated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , and NO metabolites were estimated using a colorimetric assay. Serum visfatin and NO metabolites levels were significantly elevated in the patients with diabetic nephropathy. Serum visfatin levels and NO metabolites were significantly higher in the nephropathic patients ( P = .003; 95 % confidence interval , 2.29 to 10.81; P < .001; 95 % confidence interval , 3.14 to 9.46 , respectively) as compared to the control group , whereas homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance was significantly lower ( P = .02; 95 % confidence interval , -1.51 to -1.01). There was no correlation between body mass index , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , lipid profile , insulin , and glucose levels and serum visfatin and NO metabolites levels. The results of this study demonstrated that there were high levels of visfatin and NO metabolites in patients with diabetic nephropathy. In addition , there was a positive correlation between visfatin and NO metabolites levels in nephropathic and non-nephropathic diabetic patients.
