  Pseudomelanoma is a condition that mimics a uveal melanoma. Various methods are used to differentiate between uveal melanoma and mimicking conditions , but none is definitive. We report a case of localized hemorrhagic choroidal detachment in monocular middle-aged Asian lady of Indian origin with opaque media secondary to failed corneal graft. An ultrasound scan revealed a mass lesion<symptom> suspected to be choroidal melanoma. After 10 weeks of observation and follow-up , lesion<symptom> showed complete regression as seen with serial ultrasound scans. This case is being presented for its rarity and unique presentation in a bilaterally blind patient with spontaneous resolution of pseudomelanoma documented with serial imaging.
