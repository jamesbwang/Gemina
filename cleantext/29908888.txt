  Fibrin sealant ( FS) was approved as a hemostatic agent , sealant , and adhesive by the Food and Drug Administration in 1998. Our study sought to determine whether FS also reduced edema<symptom> and pain in rhinoplasty without osteotomy. We conducted a prospective randomized trial involving patients who underwent open rhinoplasty without osteotomy. The patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: those treated with aerosolized FS ( FS group) and those not treated ( control group). The effect of FS on edema<symptom> of the eyelid , edema<symptom> of the dorsum and tip of the nose , and periorbital ecchymosis was separately rated postoperatively using a scale of 0 to 4 or 0 to 3. Postoperative pain was evaluated using questionnaires quantified with a visual analog scale. The Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare parameters between the groups. A total of 41 patients were included in this study. The FS group ( n = 20) consisted of 13 male and 7 female patients with a mean age of 34.8 ± 5.8 years. The control group ( n = 21) consisted of 15 male and 6 female patients with a mean age of 32.4 ± 4.8 years. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to age , gender , or combined surgical techniques ( P > .05). Aerosolized FS significantly reduced not only ecchymosis and swelling in the periorbital area but also edema<symptom> of the nasal dorsum ( P < .05). Aerosolized FS can be effective for reducing eyelid edema<symptom> , dorsal edema<symptom> , and periorbital ecchymosis after open rhinoplasty. FS may serve as an adhesive for minimizing dead space by promoting adherence of the skin flap and as a hemostatic agent in reducing the amount of postoperative bleeding by sealing capillary vessels.
