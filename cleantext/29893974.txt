  The first nucleosomes in the downstream of transcription starting sites are called +1 nucleosomes , which are expected to be readily unwrapped for DNA transcription. To investigate DNA accessibility in +1 nucleosomes , MNase-seq experiments were carried out with 20 reconstituted +1 nucleosomes of budding yeast. Although MNase has been known for its sequence preference in DNA digestions , we confirmed that this sequence preference is overwhelmed by DNA accessibility by identifying the sequence-driven and accessibility-driven cleavages. Specifically , we find that sequences favoured by MNase at the end regions such as TA dinucleotide are prohibited from cleavage at the internal sites in the early stage of digestion. Nevertheless , sequences less favoured by MNase at the end regions such as AA/TT dinucleotide are predominantly cleaved at the internal sites in the early stage of digestion. Since AA/TT is known as a rigid dinucleotide step resistant to DNA bending , these internal cleavages reflect the local site exposures induced by DNA mechanics. As the DNA entry site of +1 nucleosomes in yeast is found AA/TT-rich , this sequence element may play a role in gene activation by reducing DNA-histone affinities along the direction of DNA transcription.
