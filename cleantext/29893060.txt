  To report the long-term outcome of permanent tracheostomy for the management of severe laryngeal collapse secondary to brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome<disease>. Retrospective case series. Fifteen brachycephalic dogs with severe laryngeal collapse treated with permanent tracheostomy. Follow-up data were obtained from medical records or via telephone conversation with the owners. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to calculate median survival time. Death was classified as related or unrelated to tracheostomy surgery. Complications were classified as major when they were life-threatening or required revision surgery. Owners were asked to classify the postoperative quality of life as improved , unchanged , or worse and the management of the stoma as simple or demanding. The median survival time was 100 days. Major complications were diagnosed in 12 of 15 ( 80 %) dogs , resulting in death in 8 ( median survival time 15 days) and revision surgery in 4 dogs. Seven of 15 ( 47 %) dogs died of unrelated causes or were alive at the end of the study ( median survival time 1982 days). The postoperative quality of life of 9 dogs was judged as markedly improved. Stoma management was defined as simple in 8 dogs and demanding in 4. Permanent tracheostomy was associated with a high risk of complications and postoperative death in brachycephalic dogs. However , long-term survival ( exceeding 5 years) with a good quality of life was documented in 5 of 15 dogs. Permanent tracheostomy is a suitable salvage option in brachycephalic dogs with severe laryngeal collapse that did not improve following more conservative surgeries.
