  Plastic litter is encountered in aquatic ecosystems across the globe , including polar environments and the deep sea. To mitigate the adverse societal and ecological impacts of this waste , there has been debate on whether ` biodegradable ' materials should be granted exemptions from plastic bag bans and levies. However , great care must be exercised when attempting to define this term , due to the broad and complex range of physical and chemical conditions encountered within natural ecosystems. Here , we review existing international industry standards and regional test methods for evaluating the biodegradability of plastics within aquatic environments ( wastewater , unmanaged freshwater and marine habitats). We argue that current standards and test methods are insufficient in their ability to realistically predict the biodegradability of carrier bags in these environments , due to several shortcomings in experimental procedures and a paucity of information in the scientific literature. Moreover , existing biodegradability standards and test methods for aquatic environments do not involve toxicity testing or account for the potentially adverse ecological impacts of carrier bags , plastic additives , polymer degradation products or small ( microscopic) plastic particles that can arise via fragmentation. Successfully addressing these knowledge gaps is a key requirement for developing new biodegradability standard ( s) for lightweight carrier bags.
