  Surface roughness of electrodes plays a key role in the dielectric breakdown of thin-film organic devices. The rate of breakdown will increase when there are stochastic sharp spikes on the surface of electrodes. Additionally , surface having spiking morphology makes the determination of dielectric strength very challenging , specifically when the layer is relatively thin. We demonstrate here a new approach to investigate the dielectric strength of organic thin films for organic light-emitting diodes ( OLEDs). The thin films were deposited on a substrate using physical vapor deposition ( PVD) under high vacuum. The device architectures used were glass substrate/indium tin oxide ( ITO)/ organic material/aluminum ( Al) and glass substrate/Al/organic material/Al. The dielectric strength of the OLED materials was evaluated from the measured breakdown voltage and layer thickness.
