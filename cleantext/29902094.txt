  NF-E2-related factor 2 ( NRF2) regulates transcription of phase II cytoprotective enzymes to protect normal cells against oxidative stress. However , a high level of NRF2 offers a growth advantage , chemoresistance , and radioresistance in cancer. In the present study , we have identified convallatoxin as a novel inhibitor of NRF2/ARE suppression of NRF2 by convallatoxin was not transcriptionally mediated , but regulated at the level of proteolysis. Convallatoxin activated GSK-3Î² and suppression of NRF2 by convallatoxin required the Neh6 domain. Convallatoxin sensitized A549 cells to 5-FU-mediated cell death by promoting apoptosis. Together , our results provide evidence that convallatoxin might be useful as a chemotherapeutic adjuvant due to its ability to suppress NRF2/ARE.
