  It is a psychometrics study. To assess the inter-rater reliability of the International Spinal Cord Injury Upper<symptom> Extremity Basic Data Set ( ISCI-UE). Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital , Chiang Mai , Thailand. Individuals with subacute and chronic cervical spinal cord injury ( SCI) were recruited. One examiner rated five parts of the ISCI-UE , including the ability to reach and grasp , the shoulder function classification , utilization of adaptive devices used to enhance upper-extremity function , complications affecting upper-extremity function , and upper extremity/hand reconstructive surgery. A second blinded examiner repeated the procedures within 1 day. Quadratic weighted kappa was calculated to determine the inter-rater reliability. Sixty participants were included in the study. Fifty-two patients were men , and the mean ( SD) age of participants was 42.9 ( 14.3) years. The median ( interquartile range) time since injury was 9.5 ( 1-53) months. A total of 117 upper limbs were assessed. The inter-rater reliability was substantial , with almost perfect agreement in all items ( ability to reach and grasp = 0.98; shoulder function classification = 0.97; use of assistive devices = 0.89; complications = 0.74; and surgery = 1). The International Spinal Cord Injury Upper<symptom> Extremity Basic Data Set ( ISCI-UE) has very good inter-rater reliability for evaluating individuals with cervical SCI.
