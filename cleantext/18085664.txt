  Macrophages exhibit diverse effector phenotypes depending on the stimuli and their microenvironment. Classically activated macrophages are primed with interferon ( IFN) γ and stimulated with pathogen-associated molecular patterns. They produce inflammatory mediators and inflammatory cytokines , such as IL-12. In the presence of immune complexes ( ICs) , activated macrophages have decreased IL-12 production and increased IL-10 production and presumably act as regulatory macrophages. Notch signaling has been shown to regulate the effector functions of classically activated macrophages. In this study , we investigated whether Notch signaling is active in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- stimulated macrophages in the presence of ICs. LPS/IC stimulation increased the level of cleaved Notch1 in murine macrophages , while IC stimulation alone did not. Delta-like 4 , but not Jagged1 , was responsible for generating cleaved Notch1. The activation of Notch signaling by LPS/ICs depended upon NF-κB and MEK/Erk pathway activation. Macrophages with the targeted deletion of Rbpj , which encodes a DNA-binding protein central to canonical Notch signaling , produced significantly less IL-10 upon LPS/IC stimulation. A similar impact on IL-10 production was observed when Notch signaling was inhibited with a gamma-secretase inhibitor ( GSI). Defects in NF-κB p50 nuclear localization were observed in GSI-treated macrophages and in Rbpj-/- macrophages , suggesting cross-regulation between the Notch and NF-κB pathways. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Notch signaling regulates the transcription of genes involved in the cell cycle , macrophage activation , leukocyte migration and cytokine production in LPS/IC-stimulated macrophages. Taken together , these results suggest that the Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating the functions of macrophages activated by LPS and ICs.
