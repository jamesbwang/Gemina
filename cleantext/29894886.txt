  We studied the magnetic properties and trace element concentrations ( Cr , Cu , Fe , Mn , Pb , Ti , V , Zn) of urban topsoils from 111 urban sites in a large REE-Nb-Fe mining and smelting city , Baotou , Inner Mongolia , China. The results show that pseudo-single domain and multi-domain magnetite dominates the magnetic properties of the soil samples , and the magnetic concentration parameters show a large positive anomaly near the Baotou iron and steel works. The average contents of all trace metals exceeded their background level in soils in Inner Mongolia , except for Pb. The spatial distribution and correlation analysis show that magnetic parameters related to the magnetite concentration and Cr , Fe , Mn , Ti , V and Zn show similar trends of variation. In addition , the results of PCA show that Fe , Ti , and V are highly correlated with the magnetic particles derived from the Baotou iron and steel works , tailing dam , chromium plant , and cement plant. In contrast , Cr , Mn , Pb and Zn are derived from both the steel plant and traffic pollution. Using a PMF model , three potential pollution sources are identified: industrial pollution , including the steel works , tailing dam , cement plant and chromium plant , are reflected by Ï‡
