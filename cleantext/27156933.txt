  Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication therapy is commonly performed to reduce the incidence of gastric cancer. However , gastric cancer is occasionally discovered even after successful eradication therapy. Therefore , we examined the prognosis of gastric cancer patients , diagnosed after successful H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication therapy. All-cause death rates and gastric cancer-specific death rates in gastric cancer patients who received successful H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication treatment was tracked and compared to rates in patients who did not receive successful eradication therapy. In total , 160 gastric cancer patients were followed-up for up to 11.7 years ( mean 3.5 years). Among them , 53 gastric cancer patients received successful H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication therapy prior to gastric cancer diagnosis. During the follow-up period , 11 all-cause deaths occurred. In the successful eradication group , the proportion of patients with cancer stage I was higher. The proportions of patients who received curative endoscopic therapy and endoscopic examination in the 2 years prior to gastric cancer diagnosis were also higher in the successful eradication group. Kaplan-Meier analysis of all-cause death and gastric cancer-specific death revealed a lower death rate in patients in the successful eradication group ( P = .0139 , and P = .0396 , respectively , log-rank test). The multivariate analysis showed that endoscopy within 2 years before cancer diagnosis is associated with stage I cancer. Possible early discovery of gastric cancer after H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication due to regular endoscopic surveillance may contribute to better prognosis of patients with gastric cancer.
