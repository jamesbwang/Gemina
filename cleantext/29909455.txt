  In recent years , many studies on the analysis of microplastics ( MP) in environmental samples have been published. These studies are hardly comparable due to different sampling , sample preparation , as well as identification and quantification techniques. Here , MP identification is one of the crucial pitfalls. Visual identification approaches using morphological criteria alone often lead to significant errors , being especially true for MP fibers. Reliable , chemical structure-based identification methods are indispensable. In this context , the frequently used vibrational spectroscopic techniques but also thermoanalytical methods are established. However , no critical comparison of these fundamentally different approaches has ever been carried out with regard to analyzing MP in environmental samples. In this blind study , we investigated 27 single MP particles and fibers of unknown material isolated from river sediments. Successively micro-attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( Î¼-ATR-FTIR) and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( py-GCMS) in combination with thermochemolysis were applied. Both methods differentiated between plastic vs. non-plastic in the same way in 26 cases , with 19 particles and fibers ( 22 after re-evaluation) identified as the same polymer type. To illustrate the different approaches and emphasize the complementarity of their information content , we exemplarily provide a detailed comparison of four particles and three fibers and a critical discussion of advantages and disadvantages of both methods.
