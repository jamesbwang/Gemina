  Hyperbranched polymers ( HPs) have widely been used for drug delivery owing to their highly branched topology , which endows the HPs with a large amount of intramolecular cavities for drug encapsulation and terminal groups for drug conjugation. Additionally , one-pot , large-scale preparations enable the easy fabrication of HPs for biomedical applications. This review provides an overview of the synthesis of HPs and their application for drug delivery. First , we introduce a diversity of methods for the synthesis of HPs with controllable topologies. Subsequently , we discuss drug encapsulation and drug conjugation by using HPs. Finally , we highlight the use of HPs with controllable topologies for promising drug delivery.
