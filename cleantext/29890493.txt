  Volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) are regarded as the major contributors to air pollution , and should be strictly regulated. Photocatalytic oxidation ( PCO) is of great interest for the removal of VOCs owing to its strong oxidation capability. However , its application is greatly limited by catalytic deactivation. Vacuum Ultraviolet ( VUV) irradiation provides a novel way to improve the photocatalytic activity while much O
