  The Golgi apparatus is a central station for protein trafficking in eukaryotic cells. A widely accepted model of protein transport within the Golgi apparatus is cisternal maturation. Each cisterna has specific resident proteins , which are thought to be maintained by COPI-mediated transport. However , the mechanisms underlying specific sorting of these Golgi-resident proteins remain elusive. To obtain a clue to understand the selective sorting of vesicles between the Golgi cisterenae , we investigated the molecular arrangements of the conserved oligomeric Golgi ( COG) subunits in yeast cells. Mutations in COG subunits cause defects in Golgi trafficking and glycosylation of proteins and are causative of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation ( CDG) in humans. Interactions among COG subunits in cytosolic and membrane fractions were investigated by co-immunoprecipitation. Cytosolic COG subunits existed as octamers , whereas membrane-associated COG subunits formed a variety of subcomplexes. Relocation of individual COG subunits to mitochondria resulted in recruitment of only a limited number of other COG subunits to mitochondria. These results indicate that COG proteins function in the forms of a variety of subcomplexes and suggest that the COG complex does not comprise stable tethering without other interactors.Key words: The Golgi apparatus , COG complex , yeast , membrane trafficking , multi-subunit tethering complex.
