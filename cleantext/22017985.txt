  By genetic manipulations , we study the roles played by insulin-producing cells ( IPCs) in the brain and their target , the corpora allata ( CA) , for reproductive dormancy in female Drosophila melanogaster , which is induced by exposing them to a combination of low temperature ( 11 Â°C) , short-day photoperiod ( 10L: 14D) and starvation ( water only) for 7 days immediately after eclosion ( dormancy-inducing conditions). Artificial inactivation of IPCs promotes , whereas artificial activation impedes , the induction of reproductive dormancy. A transcriptional reporter assay reveals that the IPC activity is reduced when the female flies are exposed to dormancy-inducing conditions. The photoperiod sensitivity of reproductive dormancy is lost in pigment-dispersing factor ( pdf) , but not cry , mutants , suggesting that light input to IPCs is mediated by pdf-expressing neurons. Genetic manipulations to upregulate and downregulate insulin signaling in the CA , a pair of endocrine organs that synthesize the juvenile hormone ( JH) , decrease and increase the incidence of reproductive dormancy , respectively. These results demonstrate that the IPC-CA axis constitutes a key regulatory pathway for reproductive dormancy.
