  Citrus pectin is known to influence carotenoid bioaccessibility and absorption in humans , but limited attention has been given to the influence of pectin structure related to the particle size from differentially processed citrus food matrices. In this context , this study aims to investigate the nutritional health benefits of an innovative Citrus clementina concentrate , which is a new citrus-based food made by cross-flow microfiltration. This concentrated citrus-based food was selectively enriched 8-fold in β-cryptoxanthin ( 43-55 μg g-1) and β-carotene ( 6-9 μg g-1) as well as 6-fold in pectin ( 376-462 mg per 100 g). The bioaccessibility of pro-vitamin A carotenoids from commercial and fresh clementina juices versus their concentrates was assessed , including the intestinal carotenoid uptake by Caco-2 cells. Differences in particles size and pectin status resulted in a 7-fold increase in the bioaccessibility of carotenoids in industrial products versus fresh products while limiting their cellular uptake in correlation with larger micelle sizes ( 10.6 nm and 6.82 nm for industrial and fresh concentrates , respectively). Overall , the highest carotenoid bioaccessibility from industrial concentrate was sufficient to offset the lower carotenoid intestinal uptake related to micelle size. This study highlights that the structure of pectins , more specifically their degree of methoxylation , favors carotenoid bioaccessibility but impairs the intestinal absorption of carotenoids from citrus concentrates.
