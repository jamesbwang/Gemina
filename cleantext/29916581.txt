  In the last decades the knowledge on pathogenetic mechanisms of allergic diseases extraordinarily improved with relevant clinical outputs. From the ' 90 yrs we know that Th2 cells are essential for allergic inflammation<symptom> , since they produce type 2 cytokines , recognise allergens , induce IgE switch on B cells and recruit mastcells and eosinophils into tissues for maintaining the flogosis. Recently a new subset of innate immunity ( ILC2) have been shown to amplify the allergic inflammation<symptom>. The chronicity of respiratory allergy is characterised by tissue signals which address T cell to a `` Th2 high ''- ( ILC2/Th2 responses) or a `` Th2 low '' ( ILC3/Th17 responses) endotype , with a BAL prevalence of eosinophils or neutrophils , respectively. This double<symptom> response<symptom> is essentially due to T effector cell plasticity , modulated by microenvironmental signals. The discovery of new endotypes , diagnosed by selective biomarkers and cured by biological agents , will open the era of personalised medicine also for respiratory allergic disorders.
