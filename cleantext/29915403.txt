  In this edition of the American Journal of Gastroenterology , Wang and colleagues report the results of an analysis of six different case-control studies examining the relationship between Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori ( H pylori) infection and Barrett 's esophagus. They present a cogent argument that there is an inverse association between these two that is mediated via GERD. This is broadly consistent with previous reports. While further establishing this inverse association , the findings should not materially influence our routine clinical practice regarding GERD or H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection.
