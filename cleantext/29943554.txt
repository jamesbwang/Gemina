  2-Keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate ( KDPG) aldolase , which catalyzes aldol cleavage and condensation reactions , has two distinct substrate-binding sites.The substrate-binding mode at the catalytic site and Schiff-base formation have been well studied. However , structural information on the phosphate-binding loop ( P-loop) is limited.
