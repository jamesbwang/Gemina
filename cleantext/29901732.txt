  Excess protein intake in early life has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome<disease> in later life. Yet protein , and in particular the essential amino acids ( EAAs) , need to be present in adequate quantity to support growth. With the use of a piglet model restricted in dietary amino acids ( AAs) , we compared the efficacy and safety of a standard formula with a low-AA formula containing an adjusted AA composition. Female piglets ( 3-7 d old; Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc) were fed 1 of 4 isoenergetic AA-based formulas for 14 d ( 700 kJ · kg body weight-1 · d-1). The formulas contained a set control amount ( 44 g/L) and AA compositions referred to as the experimental standard ( ST-100 , n = 22) , or 20 % or 50 % lower total AAs ( respectively , ST-80 , n = 19 and ST-50 , n = 13) , or 20 % lower total AAs with an optimally adjusted EAA composition ( O-80 , n = 17). A series of clinical and paraclinical endpoints were measured. Growth rates were similar for ST-100 , O-80 and ST-80 piglets ( all ∼ 15 g · kg-1 · d-1) , whereas ST-50 had a markedly lower weight gain relative to all groups ( all P < 0.05). Relative to ST-100 , all groups with reduced AA intake showed ∼ 16 % reduction in plasma albumin and ∼ 30 % reduction in plasma urea ( both P < 0.05). The absolute leucine oxidation rate was ∼ 30 % lower for O-80 than for ST-100 piglets ( P < 0.05). These data show that a 20 % reduction in total AA intake for both the control ( ST-80) and the adjusted AA ( O-80) formula did not have any short-term adverse effects on growth in artificially reared , AA-restricted piglets. The lower absolute leucine oxidation rate observed in O-80 supports the development of an infant formula with an improved AA composition and a moderate reduction in total protein to support adequate growth in healthy infants.
