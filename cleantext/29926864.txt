  We report the effect of the Ti3C2Tx MXene flake thickness on its inherent electrochemistry and heterogeneous charge transfer characteristics. It is shown that Ti3C2Tx undergoes irreversible oxidation in a positive potential window , which strongly depends on the flake thickness and pH of the electrolyte. Few-layered Ti3C2Tx exhibits faster electron transfer kinetics ( k0 = 0.09533 cm s-1) with a ( Fe ( CN) 6) 4-/ 3- redox mediator compared to multi-layered Ti3C2Tx ( k0 = 0.00503 cm s-1). In addition , the few-layered free standing Ti3C2Tx film electrode remains intact after enduring irreversible oxidation.
