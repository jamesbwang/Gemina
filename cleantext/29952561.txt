  Several stannocene carbene complexes , 3a-3g , were synthesized and examined in solution by NMR spectroscopy and in the solid state by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In this new class of metallocene carbene complexes , coordination of the carbene to the tin atom was found to be comparably weak and mostly due to attractive dispersion forces , as indicated by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore , coordination of the N-heterocyclic carbenes results in a weakening of the Sn-Cp bonds , making these complexes very reactive and short-lived at room temperature.
