  Transcriptional regulation is a useful strategy for gene therapy and for biomedical research. Unlike chemically regulated transcriptional approaches , spatiotemporal control of transcription using optogenetic tools is a powerful technology for the analysis of single cells. For light to penetrate into tissues , it is desired to use photoreceptors absorbing red/far-red light with a low-molecular mass applicable for the use of virus vectors , and a photoswitch using the photoreceptor needs to be constructed as a single expression vector. Herein , we describe an optogenetic tool based on Arabidopsis thaliana phytochrome ( Phy) B and its binding partner , phytochrome-interacting factor ( PIF) 6. We generated a truncated PhyB , which allowed for reversible association with PIF6 by red/far-red light illumination. The red light illumination only for 5 min induced PhyB translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus by the association with PIF6 , resulting in transcriptional activation based on Gal4 DNA-binding domain and the upstream activating sequence of Gal system. The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling vector using PhyB and PIF6 might be applicable for transcriptional regulation in tissue experiments.
