  The purpose of this study is to compare intraocular pressure ( IOP) measured by the Goldmann applanation tonometer ( GAT) , the Tono-Pen XL ( TPXL) , and a noncontact airpuff tonometer ( NCT) in glaucoma patients and normal controls. In the current study , two groups of individuals were recruited; the first group included glaucoma patients ( glaucoma group) while the second one was a glaucoma-free group. The IOP was measured through GAT , NCT , and TPXL for the same participants by three different physicians in both groups. Measurements through the three devices were compared statistically. Correlations between different methods of assessment were also assessed. In the glaucoma group , the mean IOP measured was 16.0 ± 5.5 mmHg ( range , 6-40 mmHg) with GAT 20.5 ± 6.9 mmHg ( range , 10-52 mmHg) with the TPXL , and 20.2 ± 6.5 mmHg ( range , 8-50 mmHg) with the NCT. In the control group , the mean IOP was 14.0 ± 2.7 mmHg ( range , 9-19 mmHg) with GAT , 17.3 ± 3.8 mmHg ( range 6-30 mmHg) with the TPXL , and 17.9 ± 3.9 mHg ( range 10-27 mmHg) with the NCT. IOP measurements were approved among the three devices with relatively higher readings using both NTC and TPXL. All three methods are required to address different situations that present in the daily clinical and surgical practice.
