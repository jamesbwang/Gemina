  To determine if a relationship exists between low contrast detail ( LCD) detectability using the CDRAD 2.0 phantom , visual measures of image quality ( IQ) and simulated lesion<symptom> visibility ( LV) when performing digital chest radiography ( CXR). Using a range of acquisition parameters , a CDRAD 2.0 phantom was used to acquire a set of images with different levels of image quality. LCD detectability using the CDRAD 2.0 phantom , represented by an image quality figure inverse ( IQF Pearson 's correlation demonstrated a strong positive correlation ( r = 0.91; p < 0.001) between the IQ and the IQF From results presented in this study , the automated evaluation of LCD detectability using CDRAD 2.0 phantom is likely to be a suitable option for IQ and LV evaluation in digital CXR optimisation studies. Advances in knowledge: This research establishes the potential of the CDRAD 2.0 phantom in digital CXR optimisation studies.
