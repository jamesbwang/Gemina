  The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of S-adenosyl methionine ( SAMe) on infectious premature inflammatory factors and uterine contraction , and to further explore its mechanism of action via the transient receptor protein 3 ( TRPC3)/ protein kinase Cβ ( PKCβ)/ C-kinase-activated protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor of 17 kDa ( CPI-17) signaling pathway , following intervention by a TRPC3 inhibitor. A rat model of premature delivery induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) was established. Following treatment with SAMe and inhibiting TRPC3 expression , rat serum and uterus were isolated. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe the histopathological changes in the uterus. Uterine muscle strips
