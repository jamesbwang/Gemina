  A study was carried out to evaluate the effects of an automatic milking system ( AMS) on milk yield and composition of buffalo ( Mediterranean-type Bubalus bubalis) cows. Performed from January 2015 to December 2015 in an organic buffalo dairy farm equipped with both a traditional tandem milking parlor and an AMS , the study involved 90 primiparous buffaloes randomly allotted to a tandem or AMS group from 5 to 10 d of lactation onward. Number of milkings per day and daily milk yield of each cow were recorded , and individual milk sampling was carried out twice a month. Compared with the tandem , the AMS group showed significantly higher daily milk yield and persistence of lactation. Use of the AMS resulted in higher protein and casein contents , and lower somatic cell and total bacterial counts , whereas fat , freezing point , and pH were unaffected by the system. We conclude that , in terms of milk yield and quality , automatic milking may be a suitable alternative to conventional milking for buffaloes.
