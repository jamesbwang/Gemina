  The search for proximity-induced superconductivity in topological materials has generated widespread interest in the condensed matter physics community. The superconducting states inheriting nontrivial topology at interfaces are expected to exhibit exotic phenomena such as topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes , which hold promise for applications in quantum computation. However , a practical realization of such hybrid structures based on topological semimetals and superconductors has hitherto been limited. Here , we report the strong proximity-induced superconductivity in type-II Weyl semimetal WTe
