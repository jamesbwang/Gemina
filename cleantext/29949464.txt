  Nanoethosomal formulation containing silver sulfadiazine ( SSD) was used to reduce bacterial burden and healing time in burn injuries. Ethosomal formulations were characterized for their size , ζ-potential , morphology , drug encapsulation efficiency and in vitro release kinetics of SSD. The optimized nanoethosomal suspension with a size of 206.7 ± 1.18 , and ζ-potential value of -67.3 ± 0.45 mV exhibited a high SSD encapsulation efficiency ( 92.03 ± 0.79 %). Results of antimicrobial tests indicated SSD-loaded ethosome formulation led to a significant reduction of colony number. Histopathological results demonstrated a wound<disease> contraction rate of 96.83 % for the group treated with SSD ethosomal gel while untreated group showed 59.41 %. The SSD ethogels promotes the therapeutic effect of SSD for burn treatment.
