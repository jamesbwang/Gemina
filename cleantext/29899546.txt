  There exists little human neuroscience research to explain why some individuals lose their appetite<symptom> when they become depressed , while others eat more. Answering this question may reveal much about the various pathophysiologies underlying depression<symptom> The present study combined neuroimaging , salivary cortisol , and blood markers of inflammation<symptom> and metabolism collected prior to scanning. We compared the relationships between peripheral endocrine , metabolic , and immune signaling and brain activity to food cues between depressed participants experiencing increased ( N = 23) or decreased ( N = 31) appetite<symptom> and weight in their current depressive episode and healthy control participants ( N = 42). The two depression<symptom> subgroups were unmedicated and did not differ in depression<symptom> severity , anxiety<symptom> , anhedonia , or body mass index. Depressed participants experiencing decreased appetite<symptom> had higher cortisol levels than subjects in the other two groups , and their cortisol values correlated inversely with the ventral striatal response to food cues. In contrast , depressed participants experiencing increased appetite<symptom> exhibited marked immunometabolic dysregulation , with higher insulin , insulin resistance , leptin , CRP , IL-1RA , and IL-6 , and lower ghrelin than subjects in other groups , and the magnitude of their insulin resistance correlated positively with the insula response to food cues. These findings provide novel evidence linking aberrations in homeostatic signaling pathways within depression<symptom> subtypes to the activity of neural systems that respond to food cues and select when , what , and how much to eat. In conjunction with prior work , the present findings strongly support the existence of pathophysiologically distinct depression<symptom> subtypes for which the direction of appetite<symptom> change<symptom> may be an easily measured behavioral marker.
