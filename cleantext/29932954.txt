  A growing body of clinical and preclinical research suggests that structural and functional changes in the habenula , a component of the epithalamus , are associated with major depressive disorder. A major excitatory , efferent projection from the habenula targets the rostromedial tegmentum ( RMTg) , a mesopontine region that provides significant input to the ventral tegmentum and raphe nuclei. While the RMTg contributes to monoaminergic response to aversive events , its role in stress-based animal models of depression<symptom> has yet to be determined. In the present study , we test the hypothesis that the RMTg is a component of the circuitry mediating the development of a maladaptive behavior in which rats repeatedly exposed to inescapable footshock , fail to avoid or escape the same stressor when subsequently given the opportunity to do so. Excitotoxic lesions<symptom> of the RMTg significantly diminished the frequency of these escape failures 24 hours after exposure to inescapable footshock. Conversely , electrical stimulation of the Hb during the initial uncontrollable aversive event , a manipulation that enhances excitatory input to the RMTg , increased the number of trials in which subjects failed to escape an aversive stimulus when presented the option 24 hours later. These complementary results provide evidence supporting a role for the RMTg in the expression of stress-induced helpless phenotype and are an important step in understanding the contribution made by this region to the development of depression-related maladaptive behaviors.
