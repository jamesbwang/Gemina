  A respiratory function monitor ( RFM) may improve positive pressure ventilation ( PPV) technique , but many providers do not use RFM data appropriately during delivery room resuscitation. We sought to use eye-tracking technology to identify RFM parameters that neonatal providers view most commonly during simulated PPV. Mixed methods study. Neonatal providers performed RFM-guided PPV on a neonatal manikin while wearing eye-tracking glasses to quantify visual attention on displayed RFM parameters ( ie , exhaled tidal volume , flow , leak). Participants subsequently provided qualitative feedback on the eye-tracking glasses. Level 3 academic neonatal intensive care unit. Twenty neonatal resuscitation providers. Visual attention: overall gaze sample percentage; total gaze duration , visit count and average visit duration for each displayed RFM parameter. Qualitative feedback: willingness to wear eye-tracking glasses during clinical resuscitation. Twenty providers participated in this study. The mean gaze sample captured wa s 93 % ( SD 4 %). Exhaled tidal volume waveform was the RFM parameter with the highest total gaze duration ( median 23 % , IQR 13-51 %) , highest visit count ( median 5.17 per 10 s , IQR 2.82-6.16) and longest visit duration ( median 0.48 s , IQR 0.38-0.81 s). All participants were willing to wear the glasses during clinical resuscitation. Wearable eye-tracking technology is feasible to identify gaze fixation on the RFM display and is well accepted by providers. Neonatal providers look at exhaled tidal volume more than any other RFM parameter. Future applications of eye-tracking technology include use during clinical resuscitation.
