  Possible links between adhesive properties and the pre-sliding ( static) friction response of cartilage are not fully understood in the literature. The aims of this study are to investigate the relation between adhesion and relaxation time in articular cartilage , and the effect of relaxation-dependent adhesion on the pre-sliding response of cartilage. Adhesion tests were performed to evaluate the work of adhesion of cartilage at different relaxation times. Friction tests were conducted to identify the pre-sliding friction response of cartilage at relaxation times corresponding to adhesion tests. The pre-sliding friction response of cartilage was systematically linked to the work of adhesion and contact conditions by a slip-based failure model. It was found that the work of adhesion increases with relaxation time. Also , the work of adhesion is linearly correlated to the resistance to slip-based failure. In addition , as the work of adhesion increases , the adhered ( stick) area at the moment of failure increases , and the propagation rate of the annular slip ( crack) area towards its centre increases. These findings offer a mechanistic explanation of the pre-sliding friction behaviour and stick-slip response of soft hydrated interfaces such as articular cartilage and hydrogels. In addition , the linear correlation between adhesion and threshold to slip-based failure enables estimation of the adhesive strength of such interfaces directly from the pre-sliding friction response ( e.g. shear wave elastography).
