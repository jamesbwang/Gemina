  Driven by the environmental benefits that bio-bleaching could bring , the interest in xylanase has received enormous attention and hence , the search of xylanase with properties like no cellulase activity , function at elevated temperatures and pH continues. The present study reports the production of extracellular xylanase from Aspergillus<pathogen> nidulans<pathogen> using waste agro-residues as substrate. The optimum temperature ( 60 Â°C) and pH ( 9.0) , classified the xylanase as thermo and alkali tolerant. The addition of salt of Mn
