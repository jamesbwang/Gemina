  WDR5 is a chromatin-regulatory scaffold protein overexpressed in various cancers and a potential epigenetic drug target for the treatment of mixed-lineage leukemia<disease>. Here , we describe the discovery of potent and selective WDR5-WIN-site inhibitors using fragment-based methods and structure-based design. NMR-based screening of a large fragment library identified several chemically distinct hit series that bind to the WIN site within WDR5. Members of a 6,7-dihydro-5 H-pyrrolo ( 1,2- a) imidazole fragment class were expanded using a structure-based design approach to arrive at lead compounds with dissociation constants < 10 nM and micromolar cellular activity against an AML-leukemia cell line. These compounds represent starting points for the discovery of clinically useful WDR5 inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.
