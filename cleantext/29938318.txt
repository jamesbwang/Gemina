  High-risk human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV16 and HPV18) are now widely recognized as responsible for cervical cancer , which remains to be the most common gynecologic malignancy in women worldwide. It is well known that viral oncoproteins E6/E7 play key roles in HPV-associated cervical carcinogenesis. Thus , in vivo detection of the two oncoproteins may provide important diagnostic information influencing patient management. More recently , affibody molecules have been demonstrated to be a promising candidate for development as molecular imaging probes. Based on the two monomeric affibody molecules ( Z
