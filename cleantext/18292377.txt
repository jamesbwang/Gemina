  Stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide , responsible for 6.24 million deaths in 2015 ( about 11 % of all deaths). Three out of four stroke survivors suffer long term disability , as many can not return to their prior employment or live independently. Eighty-seven percent of strokes are ischemic. As an increasing volume of ischemic brain tissue proceeds to permanent infarction in the hours following the onset , immediate treatment is pivotal to increase the likelihood of good clinical outcome for the patient. Triaging stroke patients for active therapy requires assessment of the volume of salvageable and irreversible damaged tissue , respectively. With Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI) , diffusion-weighted imaging is commonly used to assess the extent of permanently damaged tissue , the core lesion<symptom>. To speed up and standardize decision-making in acute stroke management we present a fully automated algorithm , ATLAS , for delineating the core lesion<symptom>. We compare performance to widely used threshold based methodology , as well as a recently proposed state-of-the-art algorithm: COMBAT Stroke. ATLAS is a machine learning algorithm trained to match the lesion<symptom> delineation by human experts. The algorithm utilizes decision trees along with spatial pre- and post-regularization to outline the lesion<symptom>. As input data the algorithm takes images from 108 patients with acute anterior circulation stroke from the I-Know multicenter study. We divided the data into training and test data using leave-one-out cross validation to assess performance in independent patients. Performance was quantified by the Dice index. The median Dice coefficient of ATLAS algorithm was 0.6122 , which was significantly higher than COMBAT Stroke , with a median Dice coefficient of 0.5636 (
