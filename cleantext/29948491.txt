  The aim of the present study was to investigate polymerization shrinkage , shrinkage force development , and degree of monomer conversion of high- and low-viscosity dimethacrylate- and ormocer-based bulk-fill resin composites. Two flowable bulk-fill composites ( SDR , x-tra base) , two high-viscosity bulk-fill composites ( Bulk Ormocer , SonicFill) , and two conventional composite materials ( Esthet X flow , Esthet X HD) were photoactivated for 20 s at 1275 mW/cm
