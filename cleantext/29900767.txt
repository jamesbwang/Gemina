  Walruses are a challenging species to anesthetize as a result of their large mass , limited access for drug delivery , unique physiology , and small number of reports describing anesthetic procedures. Three aquarium-housed walruses ( Odobenus rosmarus) ranging in age from 3 to 11 yr old ( 344-1,000 kg) were anesthetized for dental or ophthalmic surgical procedures , with one animal anesthetized twice and one anesthetized three times. Preanesthetic medication was with intramuscular midazolam ( 0.1-0.2 mg/kg) and meperidine ( 2-3 mg/kg). A catheter was placed in the extradural intravertebral vein , and anesthesia was induced with propofol to effect. Orotracheal intubation was performed and anesthesia maintained with isoflurane in oxygen using a circle breathing system connected to a ventilator. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was used in all procedures. For the ophthalmic surgery , the neuromuscular blocking agent , cisatracurium , was given intravenously to provide a central eye and optimal surgical conditions. The neuromuscular block was antagonized with edrophonium. Total anesthesia times ranged from 1.5 to 6 hr. Midazolam and meperidine were antagonized with flumazenil and naltrexone , respectively , in five of six cases. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents were provided for analgesia. Recoveries were calm and uneventful. The described anesthetic protocols and case management were successful under the conditions encountered.
