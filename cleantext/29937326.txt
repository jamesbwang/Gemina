  Social cognition and emotion processing are compromised in schizophrenia. Disruptions in these domains may also be present during the psychosis-risk state. Aversive conditioning is an established translational research paradigm to investigate affective reactivity and learning. Using an aversive conditioning ERP paradigm with social cues , we examined whether psychosis patients and at-risk youths differentially respond to aversively conditioned faces. Participants ( ages 10-30) were enrolled into three demographically-matched groups: clinical risk for psychosis ( CR , n = 32) , psychosis ( PS , n = 26) , and healthy control ( HC , n = 33). EEGs were recorded during a delay aversive conditioning task in which three neutral faces were paired with an aversive tone at 100 % , 50 % and 0 % contingencies. Analysis focused on group differences in ERP peaks representing visual processing ( occipital P120) , emotional valence ( frontal VPP) , and directed attention ( parietal-occipital P300) , for dimensions of aversiveness ( 100 % vs. 0 %) and unpredictability ( 50 % vs. 100 % + 0 %). HC , but not CR or PS , showed increased P300 amplitude to aversive vs. non-aversive conditioned stimuli. CR , but not PS or HC , showed increased VPP amplitude to unpredictable vs. predictable stimuli. PS and CR both fail to allocate appropriate salience to social cues that are predictably aversive. CR , but not PS exhibit heightened emotional reactivity to social cues that are of uncertain salience. Clinical risk for schizophrenia may involve neural abnormalities distinct from both healthy and fully-established disease states.
