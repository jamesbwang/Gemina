  We developed an innovative approach that couples headspace solid-phase microextraction ( SPME) with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy ( SERS) to detect a volatile pesticide ( i.e. , fonofos) in a liquid complex matrix ( i.e. , apple juice). A gold nanoparticles-coated fiber was fabricated by reducing gold ( III) on a chemically etched stainless steel wire to extract pesticide , using SPME. The fabricated fibers were then tested by a headspace-SPME method and a dip-SPME method , followed by SERS detection of fonofos in water and apple juice samples. Using the headspace-SPME method , we can detect as low as 5 ppb of fonofos in water and apple juice , compared with the dip-SPME method , which can not detect lower than 10 ppb in water and 50 ppb in apple juice. This study demonstrated the potential capability of the headspace-SPME-SERS method for rapid ( within 30 min) and sensitive detection of volatile and vaporizable compounds in complex matrices. The developed method could be a potential alternative approach to the gas chromatography method. Future work is needed to optimize the fiber by minimizing signal variation , and it should be tested in a variety of targeted compounds and matrices.
