  Elevated mechanical stress applied to vascular walls is well known to modulate vascular remodeling and plays a part in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. On the other hand , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA) , an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , has been shown to protect against several types of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis and hypertension. The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of pulsatile pressure stress and DHA on angiotensin II-induced proliferation and migration in A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs). Pulsatile pressure of between 80 and 160 mmHg was repeatedly applied to VSMCs at a frequency of 4 cycles per min using an apparatus that we developed. Cell proliferation and migration were evaluated using a live cell movie analyzer. Application of pulsatile pressure stress for 24 h significantly increased cell proliferation. Angiotensin II also significantly increased cell proliferation in the presence or absence of pressure stress. DHA significantly inhibited angiotensin II-induced cell proliferation regardless of the pressure load. Angiotensin II significantly induced cell migration regardless of the pulsatile pressure load. Pulsatile pressure stress alone slightly , but not significantly , induced cell migration. DHA inhibited angiotensin II-induced VSMC proliferation and migration under abnormal<symptom> pressure<symptom> conditions. Pressure stress tended to induce extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK) phosphorylation in the absence of angiotensin II , whereas it significantly induced ERK phosphorylation in the presence of angiotensin II. However , the pressure-induced ERK phosphorylation was not observed in the DHA-treated VSMCs. Our findings may contribute to the understanding of the beneficial effect of DHA on various cardiovascular disorders.
