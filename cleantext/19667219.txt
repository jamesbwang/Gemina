  Management of epilepsy during pregnancy in a resource-limited setting ( RLS) is challenging. This study aimed to assess obstetric outcomes and effects on babies of women with epilepsy ( WWE) exposed to Anti-epileptic drugs ( AEDs) compared to non-exposed controls in a RLS. Pregnant WWE were recruited from antenatal and neurology clinics of a tertiary care hospitals in Sri Lanka. Patients were reviewed in each trimester and post-partum. Medication adherence , adverse effects , seizure<symptom> control and carbamazepine blood levels were monitored. Post-partum , measurements for anthropometric and dysmorphic features of the babies and congenital abnormalities were recorded. Age and sex matched babies not exposed to AED recruited as controls were also examined. Ninety-six pregnant WWE were recruited ( mean period of gestation 22.9 weeks). Mean age was 28 years and 48 ( 50 %) were primigravidae. Fifty percent ( 48) were on monotherapy , while 23.8 , 15.9 and 4.1 % were on two , three and four AEDs respectively. AEDs in first trimester ( TM1) were carbamazepine ( 71 %) , valproate ( 25.8 %) clobazam ( 29.5 %) , lamotrigine ( 7 %) topiramate ( 5 %) and others ( 3.4 %). Sodium valproate use reduced significantly from T1 to T2 ( p < 0.05). Sub-therapeutic carbamazepine levels correlated positively ( r = 0.547) with poor medication adherence ( p = 0.009) and negatively ( r = 0.306) with adverse effects ( p = 0.002). Seventy-six WWE completed follow-up reporting w 75 ( 98.6 %) live births and one T1 miscarriage ( 1.3 %). Three ( 4.3 %) were preterm. Majority ( 73.33 %) were normal vaginal deliveries. Cesarean sections were not increased in WWE. Fifty-nine ( 61.45 %) babies were examined. For those examined during infancy , 53 age and sex matched controls were recruited and examined.. Congenital abnormalities occurred in 5 ( 9.43 %) babies of WWE ( atrio-ventricular septal defect ( 2) , renal hypoplasia ( 1) , cryptorchidism ( 1) , microcephaly ( 1)) compared to 2 ( 3.77 %) in controls ( 2 microcephaly; p = 0.24). Fetal exposure to AEDs increased a risk of low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( RR 2.8; p = 0.049). Anthropometric parameters of AED exposed babies were lower at birth but not statistically significant between the two groups ( weight p = 0.263 , length p = 0.363 , occipito-frontal circumference ( OFC) p = 0.307). However , weight ( p = 0.009) , length ( p = 0.016) and OFC ( p = 0.002) were significantly lower compared to controls at an average of 3.52 months. Most pregnancies are unplanned in the RLS studied , and AEDs were altered during pregnancy. Congenital anomalies occurred at rates comparable to previous reports. Fetal exposure to AED had growth retardation in infancy compared to non-exposed babies.
