  A multidisciplinary approach for the production and characterization of colloidal quantum dots , which show great promise for implementation in modern optoelectronic applications , is described. The approach includes the design and formation of unique core/shell structures with alloy-composed layers between the core and the shell. Such structures eliminate interfacial defects and suppress the Auger process , thus reducing the known fluorescence blinking and endowing the quantum dots with robust chemical and spectral stability. The unique design enables the generation and sustained existence of single and multiple excitons with a defined spin-polarized emission recombination. The studies described herein implement the use of single-dot magneto-optical measurements and optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy , for direct identification of interfacial defects and for resolving exciton fine structure. The results are of paramount importance for a fundamental understanding of optical transitions in colloidal quantum dots , with an impact on appropriate materials design for practical applications.
