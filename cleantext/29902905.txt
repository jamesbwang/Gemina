  This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of total C-21 steroidal glycoside ( TCSG) from Baishouwu on the proliferation , invasion and apoptosis of human hepatoma HepG2 cells in vitro and the relevant molecular mechanism. The experiment was divded into control group , TCSG groups ( 25 , 60 , 150 mg · L ⁻¹) and positive control cisplatin group ( 1.33 mg · L ⁻¹). Human hepatocyte L-02 cells and hepatoma HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations of TCSG. Then , the inhibitory effect of TCSG on the proliferation of HepG2 cells was detected by CCK-8 method. Cell cycle , cell apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by flow cytometry. The apoptotic morphology was observed by Hoechst 33258 staining. Cell migration and invasion abilities were analyzed by Transwell chamber model. The protein expressions of Bcl-2 , Bax , caspase 3 , cleaved caspase 3 and Cyt C ( cytosolchondrial) were detected by Western blot. Compared with the control group , the proliferation of HepG2 cells was significantly inhibited after treatment with different concentrations of TCSG for 48 h in a dose-dependent manner (
