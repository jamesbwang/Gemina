  Endometriosis is a common gynecological condition with unclear pathogenesis. Although a dysregulated lncRNA expression profile has been speculated , very few studies have addressed this hypothesis. We determined the differential lncRNA and mRNA expression patterns between endometriosis and control tissues , and between eutopic and normal endometrium in the proliferative phase , using RNA sequencing. The potential targets of lncRNA were predicted on the basis of cis and trans action , and lncRNAs were functionally annotated in relation to their co-expressed mRNAs. Dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs were screened relative to the biological features of endometriosis , and the five filtered lncRNAs were validated using qRT-PCR. A total of 9924 novel lncRNA transcripts were identified , and 86 lncRNAs and 1228 mRNAs were differentially expressed between the endometriosis and control groups. GO and KEGG pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed lncRNAs were enriched in the biological processes and signaling pathways involved in endometriosis. A coding-noncoding gene ( CNC) co-expression network was constructed using the dysregulated lncRNAs and their co-expressed mRNAs to simulate the complex intergenic interactions. This study is the first to use sequencing technology to elucidate the differentially lncRNA expression profiles of eutopic and normal endometrium in the proliferative phase of endometriosis. The dysregulated lncRNAs can potentially be novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets of endometriosis.
