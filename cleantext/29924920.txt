  The hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) has attracted much attention within the scientific community because of increasing demands of modern society for clean and renewable energy sources. Molecular complexes of 3d-transition metals , such as cobalt , hold potential to replace platinum for the HER in acidic media. Among these , cage complexes such as tris-glyoximate metal clathrochelates , have demonstrated promising catalytic properties towards the HER. However , it is not clear whether the catalytic activity of this molecule stems from metal-centered activation of H
