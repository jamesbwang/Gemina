  Greater passive hip range of motion ( ROM) has been associated with greater dynamic knee valgus and thus the potential for increased risk of anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Normative data for passive hip ROM by sex are lacking. To establish and compare passive hip ROM values by sex and sport and to quantify side-to-side differences in internal-rotation ROM ( ROM Cross-sectional study. Station-based , preparticipation screening. A total of 339 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I athletes , consisting of 168 women ( age = 19.2 ± 1.2 years , height = 169.0 ± 7.2 cm , mass = 65.3 ± 10.2 kg) and 171 men ( age = 19.4 ± 1.3 years , height = 200.0 ± 8.6 cm , mass = 78.4 ± 12.0 kg) in 6 sports screened over 3 years: soccer ( 58 women , 67 men) , tennis ( 20 women , 22 men) , basketball ( 28 women , 22 men) , softball or baseball ( 38 women , 31 men) , cross-country ( 18 women , 19 men) , and golf ( 6 women , 10 men). Passive hip ROM was measured with the athlete lying prone with the hip abducted to 20 ° to 30 ° and knee flexed to 90 °. The leg was passively internally and externally rotated until the point of sacral movement. Three measures were averaged for each direction and leg and used for analysis. We compared ROM Women had greater ROM Women had greater ROM
