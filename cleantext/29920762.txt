  Coeliac disease is a common but markedly under-diagnosed condition , which may lead to serious long-term complications if untreated. Both the diagnostic yield and true incidence have significantly increased during the last few decades and it is now one of the most common chronic gastrointestinal conditions in children. The aim of this review was to summarise the current concepts on screening for coeliac disease in children and adolescents. We conducted a non-systematic literature review of papers published about coeliac disease screening since the year 2000. Our review showed that the diagnostic yield could be significantly improved by screening for at-risk groups , or even the whole population , but these approaches remain controversial. Evidence suggests that screening for certain high-risk groups could be beneficial , but untargeted mass screening is not currently recommended. However , whether the benefits of an early diagnosis would overcome the challenges of lifelong dietary treatment , especially in asymptomatic individuals who consider themselves healthy , are unclear. There is moderate evidence that screening certain at-risk groups for coeliac disease could be beneficial , but more studies in different settings are needed before large-scale population screening can be recommended.
