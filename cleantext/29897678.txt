  Wolbachia<pathogen> sp.<pathogen> has colonized over 70 % of insect species , successfully manipulating host fertility , protein expression , lifespan , and metabolism. Understanding and engineering the biochemistry and physiology of Wolbachia holds great promise for insect vector-borne disease eradication. Wolbachia<pathogen> is cultured in cell lines , which have long duplication times and are difficult to manipulate and study. The yeast strain Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> W303 was used successfully as an artificial host for Wolbachia<pathogen> wAlbB. As compared to controls , infected yeast lost viability early , probably as a result of an abnormally high mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity observed at late stages of growth. No respiratory chain proteins from Wolbachia were detected , while several Wolbachia F
