  To promote drug delivery to exact sites and cell types , the surface of nanocarriers is functionalized with targeting antibodies or ligands , typically coupled by covalent chemistry. Once the nanocarrier is exposed to biological fluid such as plasma , however , its surface is inevitably covered with various biomolecules forming the protein corona , which masks the targeting ability of the nanoparticle. Here , we show that we can use a pre-adsorption process to attach targeting antibodies to the surface of the nanocarrier. Pre-adsorbed antibodies remain functional and are not completely exchanged or covered by the biomolecular corona , whereas coupled antibodies are more affected by this shielding. We conclude that pre-adsorption is potentially a versatile , efficient and rapid method of attaching targeting moieties to the surface of nanocarriers.
