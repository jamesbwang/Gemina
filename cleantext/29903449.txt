  In this chapter , we present the bedside assessment and laboratory tests that are available for the neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation of children and adults with cerebellar diseases. In the evaluation of a patient with cerebellar dysfunction , recognizing the pattern of ocular motor and/ or vestibular impairment is often a key step to the correct diagnosis. The cerebellum is very important in processing a wide range of different eye movements<symptom> , including angular vestibulo-ocular reflexes , otolith-ocular reflexes , fixation and gaze holding , smooth pursuit eye movements<symptom> , saccadic eye movements<symptom> , optokinetic response , ocular alignment , and vergence. Quantitative eye movement<symptom> recording is now widely available in specialized clinics and medical practices , especially for testing the vestibulo-ocular reflexes. We describe the approach for assessing specific eye movements<symptom> linked to cerebellar function , discuss appropriate eye movement<symptom> laboratory tests , and summarize recent related research findings. In addition , for each laboratory test , we discuss its advantages , disadvantages , indications , and interpretations. Furthermore , we provide differential diagnoses for specific ocular motor and vestibular abnormalities such as slow saccades or impaired vestibulo-ocular reflexes.
