  Minimaly invasive repair of pectus excavatum ( MIRPE) is a widely used technique for correction of pectus excavatum. Yet despite the advancement in the surgical techniques , it is still associated with various complications including bar displacement leading to reoperation. To overcome this problem , we developed the double compression and complete fixation-double bar ( DCCF) system which consists of two metal bars that are inserted above and below the sternum and compressed to correct pectus excavatum. Patients who underwent pectus excavatum correction surgery at this center between April 2006 and March 2017 were divided into the DCCF system group and the conventional Nuss procedure group and their demographic , clinical and surgical characteristics were compared. A total of 220 underwent DCCF system procedure , and 306 patients underwent conventional Nuss procedure. The DCCF system group had significantly shorter operation time ( p < 0.001) and postoperative hospital admission time ( p < 0.001) compared to the conventional Nuss procedure group. There were only 2 cases ( 0.9 %) of postoperative complications in DCCF system group which was significantly less than that of the conventional Nuss procedure group ( n = 64 , 20.9 % , p < 0.001). In particular , there were no cases of bar displacement in DCCF system group. DCCF system was applied to surgical correction of pectus excavatum which led to significant reduction in the operation time and postoperative hospital admission period , as well as reduced MIRPE complication and bar displacement rates. Therefore we recommend the application of DCCF to the surgical correction of pectus excavatum.
