  To address target vessels in pararenal and thoracoabdominal aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease> with fenestrated and branched grafts , two solutions are available: fenestrations ( holes in the graft) and directional side-branches. Fenestrations work well for target vessels that have a close to 90-degree take-off from the aorta , and when the main graft at the level of the target vessel is adjacent or close to the aortic wall. Directional side-branches work well when target vessels have a steeper take-off angle and when there is a larger gap to be bridged. A third option of `` inner branches '' has been evaluated by our group to address target vessels that are not very suitable for either a fenestration or a directional side- branch. Most pararenal aneurysms<disease> are treated with fenestrated grafts , whereas thoraco- abdominal aneurysms<disease> are treated mostly by grafts incorporating both fenestrations and branches. In Nuremberg , 347 patients were treated with fenestrated/branched grafts for thoraco- abdominal aneurysms<disease>. A stent-graft with fenestrations only was used in 108 ( 31.1 %) patients , a stent-graft with branches only in 104 ( 30.0 %) patients , and a stent-graft with a combination of fenestrations and branches in 135 ( 38.9 %) patients. For the RAs ( n = 625) fenestrations were used in 408 ( 65.3 %) and branches in 217 ( 34.7 %). For the SMA ( n = 341) fenestrations were used in 169 ( 49.6 %) and branches in 172 ( 50.4 %). For the CA ( n = 297) , fenestrations were used in 84 ( 28.3 %) , and branches in 213 ( 71.7 %). Target vessel patency at 3 years was 98.2 ± 0.9 % for vessels targeted with fenestrations and 92.2 ± 1.9 % for vessels targeted with branches ( p = 0.009).
