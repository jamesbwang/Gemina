  We use the time-dependent variational method to examine the formation of localized patterns in dynamically unstable anharmonic lattices with cubic-quintic nonlinearities and fourth-order dispersion. The governing equation is an extended nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation known for modified Frankel-Kontorova models of atomic lattices and here derived from an extended Bose-Hubbard model of bosonic lattices with local three-body interactions. In presence of modulated waves , we derive and investigate the ordinary differential equations for the time evolution of the amplitude and phase of dynamical perturbation. Through an effective potential , we find the modulationally unstable domains of the lattice and discuss the effect of the fourth-order dispersion in the dynamics. Direct numerical simulations are performed to support our analytical results , and a good agreement is found. Various types of localized patterns , including breathers and solitonic chirped-like pulses , form in the system as a result of interplay between the cubic-quintic nonlinearities and the second- and fourth-order dispersions.
