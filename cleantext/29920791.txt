  Vitamin E ( Vit. E) is discussed to influence ruminal biohydrogenation. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of a Vit. E supplementation on rumen fermentation characteristics , ruminal microbial protein synthesis as well as ruminal organic matter fermentation. Furthermore , we aimed to investigate the influence of Vit. E supplementation on short-chain fatty acids ( SCFA) and protozoa concentrations in the rumen and , in addition , on transfer rates of middle-chain and long-chain fatty acids into the duodenum in lactating dairy cows. Eight rumen and duodenum fistulated German Holstein cows were assigned to either a group receiving 2,327 IU/d Vit. E ( 138.6 IU/kg DM DL-Î±-tocopherylacetate; n = 4) or a control group ( 23.1 IU/kg DM; n = 4). Neither ruminal protein synthesis nor organic matter fermentation was influenced by treatment. Vit. E did not act on the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids and protozoa in rumen fluid. Duodenal flow of C13: 0 ( 1.3 versus 0.2 g/d , p = 0.014) and iso-C14: 0 ( 1.0 versus 0.5 g/d , p = 0.050) was higher in the Vit. E group. We observed a trend for higher duodenal flows for C12: 0 ( 1.6 versus 0.9 g/d , p = 0.095) and anteiso-C15: 0 ( 12.2 versus 8.9 g/d , p = 0.084). Transfer rate of C12: 0 tended to be higher in the Vit. E group ( 125.61 versus 73.96 , p = 0.082). No other transfer rates were affected by treatment. Further studies are necessary to investigate the influence of Vit. E on rumen microbiota and their fatty acid production as well as on the impact of different doses of Vit. E supplementation on variables of protein synthesis efficiency.
