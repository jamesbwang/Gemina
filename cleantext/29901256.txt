  The extraradical hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> ( AMF) harbor and interact with a microbial community performing multiple functions. However , how the AMF-microbiome interaction influences the phosphorus ( P) acquisition efficiency of the mycorrhizal pathway is unclear. Here we investigated whether AMF and their hyphal microbiome play a role in promoting organic phosphorus ( P) mineralizing under field conditions. We developed an AMF hyphae in-growth core system for the field by using PVC tubes sealed with membrane with different size of pores ( 30 or 0.45 Î¼m) to allow or deny AMF hyphae access to a patch of organic P in root-free soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> and their hyphae associated microbiome played a role in enhancing soil organic P mineralization in situ in the field , which was shown to be a function of the change in bacteria community on the hyphae surface. The bacterial communities attached to the AMF hyphae surface were significantly different from those in the bulk soil. Importantly , AMF hyphae recruited bacteria that produced alkaline phosphatase and provided a function that was absent from the hyphae. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding trophic interactions to be able to gain insight into the functional controls of nutrient cycles in the rhizosphere.
