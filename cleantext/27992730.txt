  The Affordable Care Act ( ACA) established the health insurance marketplaces to provide people the opportunity to obtain healthcare coverage. Assisters have worked with people who may have difficulty understanding the new system and selecting the right plan. This study aims to describe the local availability of assister programs , and examine the factors influencing assister provision. The 2016 Small Area Health Insurance Estimates data and a database of assister programs constructed using healthcare.gov were analyzed at the county level. Bivariate analysis by assister provision was performed to determine the differences between the two groups , and the hierarchical generalized linear model was used to examine the factors predicting assister availability. The study analyzed 2260 counties nested within 35 states. Assister availability largely varied across counties and states. About half of the counties did not provide assisters at all , and the assister provision rate at state level ranged between 19- 100 %. Counties in metropolitan areas were more likely to provide assister programs than rural areas , and so were counties with higher adult uninsured rate or higher uninsured rate among the people with incomes between 138- 400 % of federal poverty level ( FPL). Despite the important role of in-person assistance in plan enrollment , no previous study has examined the local variability of assister program. Our study found a large geographical variation in assister availability , raising concerns about the disparity in access to assister service.
