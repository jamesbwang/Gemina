  We investigated whether there was a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment ( CI) and/or physical frailty ( PF) in persons with diabetes compared to their non-diabetic counterparts , and the individual and combined impact of CI and PF on functional and mortality outcomes among diabetic older persons. Community-living diabetic and non-diabetic participants ( N = 2696) aged 55 and above were assessed on CI ( MMSE) and PF ( CHS criteria) status. Among 486 diabetic persons , we estimated the odds ratio and 95 % confidence intervals ( OR , 95 % CI) of association of CI and/or PF with prevalent IADL and ADL disability and mortality from 11 years of follow up. Diabetes was associated with significantly higher prevalence of CI and/or PF. Adjusted for sex , age , education , smoking , alcohol intake , physical activity , and BMI , diabetes was associated with higher prevalence of PF alone ( OR = 2.24 , 1.16-4.34) and PF with CI ( OR = 2.01 , 1.12-3.60) , but not with CI alone ( OR = 1.02 , 0.73-1.44). In multivariable analyses of 486 diabetic older adults , compared to non-frail ( NF) and cognitive normal ( CN) , CI alone was not significantly associated with IADL ( OR = 1.06 , 0.53-2.10) , but PF alone was associated with considerably higher prevalence of IADL ( OR = 6.72 , 1.84-24.5). PF with CI was associated with the highest prevalence of IADL ( OR = 17.8 , 3.66-8.68) and ADL disability ( OR = 93.8 , 23.6-372.4). Whether singly or in combination , PF and/or CI were associated with worse hazard ( HR) ratio for mortality outcomes: CI alone ( HR = 2.72 , 1.48-5.01) , PF alone ( HR = 4.30 , 1.88-9.82) and CI with PF ( HR = 8.41 , 3.95-17.9). Cognitive impairment and/or physical frailty are powerful prognostic factors identifying people with diabetes at high risk of mortality.
