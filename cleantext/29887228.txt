  To investigate the dose-dependent effects of isoflurane and dobutamine on haemodynamics in dogs with experimentally induced mitral valve insufficiency ( MI). Experimental , dose-response study. Six healthy Beagle dogs. Dogs with surgically induced MI were anaesthetized once. First , anaesthesia was maintained at an end-tidal isoflurane concentration ( Fe'Iso) 1.0 % ( ISO1 .0) for 20 minutes. Then , dobutamine was infused successively at 2 , 4 , 8 and 12 μg kg High isoflurane concentration resulted in reduced Ees and increased Ea/Ees , which indicated low arterial pressure. High-dose dobutamine administration resulted in increased Ees and FSV at all isoflurane concentrations. In ISO1 .5 and ISO2 .0 , HR was lower at DOB4 than baseline ( BL) but increased at DOB12 compared with DOB4. CO increased at ≥ DOB8 compared with BL. In ISO1 .5 and ISO2 .0 , systolic and mean AoP increased at ≥ DOB4 and ≥ DOB8 , respectively. LAP did not change under all conditions. The dose-dependent hypotensive effect of isoflurane in MI dogs was mainly derived from the decrease in contractility. Dobutamine increased AoP without increasing LAP by increasing the contractility attenuated by isoflurane. Our findings may improve the cardiovascular management of dogs with MI undergoing general anaesthesia with isoflurane.
