  Reduction or complete prevention of ice crystal formation during freezing of biological specimens is mandatory for two important biological applications: ( 1) cryopreservation of living cells or tissues for long-term storage , and ( 2) cryo-fixation for ultrastructural investigations by electron microscopy. Here , a protocol that is fast , easy-to-use , and suitable for both cryo-fixation and cryopreservation is described. Samples are rapidly cooled in tightly sealed metal tubes of high thermal diffusivity and then plunged into a liquid cryogen. Due to the fast cooling speed and high-pressure buildup internally in the confined volume of the metal tubes , ice crystal formation is reduced or completely prevented , resulting in vitrification of the sample. For cryopreservation , however , a similar principle applies to prevent ice crystal formation during re-warming. A detailed description of procedures for cooling ( and re-warming) of biological samples using this technique is provided. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
