  Crosstalk between the BMP and TGF- & beta; signaling pathways regulates many complex developmental processes from the earliest stages of embryogenesis throughout adult life. In many situations , the two signaling pathways act reciprocally. For example , TGF- & beta; signaling is generally pro-fibrotic , whereas BMP signaling is anti-fibrotic and pro-calcific. Sex-specific differences occur in many diseases including cardiovascular pathologies. Differing ratios of fibrosis<disease> and calcification in stenotic valves suggests that BMP/TGF- & beta; signaling may vary in men and women. In this review , we focus on the current understanding of the interplay between sex and BMP/TGF- & beta; signaling and pose several unanswered questions.
