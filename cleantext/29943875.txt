  The pathology of asthma is characterized by airway inflammation<symptom> ( granulocytic ( GA) or paucigranulocytic ( PGA)) and remodelling of airway structures. However , the relationship between inflammatory phenotypes and remodelling is unclear. We hypothesized that some features of airway remodelling are dependent on granulocytic airway inflammation<symptom> while others are not. Post-mortem airway sections from control subjects ( n = 48) and cases of asthma with ( n = 51) or without ( n = 29) granulocytic inflammation<symptom> in the inner airway wall were studied. The thickness of the airway smooth muscle ( ASM) layer , basement membrane and inner and outer airway walls , the size and number of ASM cells , the volume fraction of extracellular matrix within the ASM layer , ASM shortening and luminal mucus were estimated. Airway dimensions were compared between the three subject groups. In cases of PGA , only the thickness of the ASM layer and basement membrane was increased compared with control subjects. In cases of GA , not only the ASM and basement membrane were increased in thickness , but there was also increased inner and outer airway wall thickness and increased narrowing of the airway lumen due to ASM shortening and mucus obstruction , compared with control subjects. Granulocytic inflammation<symptom> was observed more often in cases of fatal asthma. These findings suggest that inner and outer wall thickening coexists with inflammation<symptom> , whereas thickening of the ASM layer and basement membrane may be present even in the absence of inflammation<symptom>. Remodelling of the ASM layer and basement membrane may therefore be less susceptible to anti-inflammatory therapy.
