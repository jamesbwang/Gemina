  This study characterized the flavonoid and non-flavonoid phenolic composition of Carménère and Cabernet Sauvignon wines that were in contact with barrels , chips and staves during a 12-month aging period. The wines were evaluated by spectrophotometric ( for total phenols , anthocyanins and tannins , colorant intensity , hue , CIElab parameters and fractionation into mono- , oligo- and polymer of proanthocyanidins) and HPLC-DAD analyses ( for ellagitannins , gallotannins , anthocyanins and low molecular weight phenols). Wines in contact with oak wood presented a strong enrichment with non-flavonoid compounds , such as caffeic , gallic , ellagic acids and ellagitannins. Wines in contact with staves stood out for the increased presence of total phenols , vanillic acid and higher color intensity , while wines aged in contact with chips showed large contents of proanthocyanidin gallates. Wines aged in barrels exhibited high contents of ellagitannins and ethyl gallates. The effect of wood on the phenolic composition was mostly associated to the original and intrinsic characteristics of each grape variety. Extraction of phenolic compounds from oak wood during wine aging is closely related to the wood format , grape variety ( Carménère or Cabernet Sauvignon) and aging time. The final effect of wood on wine would be related not just to the transference of polyphenols from wood but also to structural modifications of grape polyphenols.
