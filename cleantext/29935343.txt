  The biological processes involved in banana fruit ripening are extremely complex and modulated by a number of genes such as transcription factors ( TFs). Although TFs like MADS , ERF and NAC are implicated in controlling banana ripening , little is known about other TFs such as TCP in this process. In this work , 25 MaTCPs named MaTCP1 to MaTCP25 were characterized from our previously reported transcriptomes related to banana ripening. Expression analysis revealed that these MaTCPs displayed differential expression patterns during the progression of banana ripening. Particularly , MaTCP5 , MaTCP19 and MaTCP20 were ethylene-inducible and nuclear-localized , with MaTCP5 and MaTCP20 acting as transcriptional activators while MaTCP19 being a transcriptional inhibitor. Moreover , MaTCP5 and MaTCP20 promoted the transcription of MaXTH10/11 that may play a role in fruit softening during banana ripening , whereas MaTCP19 repressed their transcription , by directly binding to their promoters. Importantly , protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated that MaTCP20 physically interacts with MaTCP5 and MaTCP19 to form heterodimers in vitro and in vivo , and these protein complexes affects their transcriptional activities in regulating the target genes. Taken together , our results provide an overview of the interactions between MaTCPs in controlling the ripening-associated genes and lay a foundation for further investigation of MaTCP gene family in regulating banana fruit ripening.
