  Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors ( RORs) include RORα ( NR1F1) , RORβ ( NR1F2) , and RORγ ( NR1F3). These receptors are reported to activate transcription through ligand-dependent interactions with co-regulators and are involved in the development of secondary lymphoid tissues , autoimmune diseases , inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> , the circadian rhythm , and metabolism homeostasis. Researches on RORs contributing to cancer-related processes have been growing , and they provide evidence that RORs are likely to be considered as potential therapeutic targets in many cancers. RORα has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer and has been investigated in melanoma , colorectal colon cancer , and gastric cancer. RORβ is mainly expressed in the central nervous system , but it has also been studied in pharyngeal cancer , uterine leiomyosarcoma , and colorectal cancer , in addition to neuroblastoma , and recent studies suggest that RORγ is involved in various cancers , including lymphoma , melanoma , and lung cancer. Some studies found RORγ to be upregulated in cancer tissues compared with normal tissues , while others indicated the opposite results. With respect to the mechanisms of RORs in cancer , previous studies on the regulatory mechanisms of RORs in cancer were mostly focused on immune cells and cytokines , but lately there have been investigations concentrating on RORs themselves. Thus , this review summarizes reports on the regulation of RORs in cancer and highlights potential therapeutic targets in cancer.
