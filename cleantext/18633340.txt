  To show the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) , soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 ( sVEGFR-1) in patients with end-stage renal disease ( ESRD) and to show the associations with clinical findings such as demographic features , laboratory findings , comorbidities , and medications. A total of 73 people , consisting of patients with ESRD ( n = 38) and healthy subjects ( n = 35) in Gulhane Education and Research Hospital , Ankara , Turkey , were included in this cross-sectional study between the years 2011 and 2013. Blood samples were obtained and plasma VEGF , sVEGFR-1 analyzes were performed. Results: The VEGF level of ESRD group was not significantly higher ( 0.280 ± 0.264) than the control group ( 0.321 ± 0.210) ( p = 0.475). The sVEGFR-1 level of ESRD group was significantly higher ( 0.217 ± 0.135) than the control group ( 0.068 ± 0.047) ( p less than 0.001). The correlation between VEGF and sVEGFR-1 was significant and negative ( r = -0.246 , p = 0.036). Average VEGF level of ESRD patients using recombinant human erythropoietin ( rhEPO) was significantly higher ( 0.567 ± 0.28) than the ESRD patients not using rhEPO ( 0.246 ± 0.24) ( p = 0.025). Our study is the first showing the significance of sVEGFR-1 in ESRD patients , and associations with comorbidities , medications. Especially our finding of rhEPO and VEGF may illuminate a reasonable positive effect of rhEPO on angiogenesis. Soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 and VEGF may be important markers in the pathophysiology of ESRD.
