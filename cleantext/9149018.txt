  Knowledge of the pathology of axillary lymph nodes ( ALN) in breast cancer patients is critical for determining their treatment. Ultrasound is the best noninvasive evaluation for the ALN status. However , the correlation between negative ultrasound results and the sentinel lymph nodes ( SLN) pathology remains unknown. To test the hypothesis that negative ultrasound results of ALN predict the negative pathology results of SLN in breast cancer patients , we assessed the association between ALN ultrasonography-negative results and the SLN pathology in 3115 patients with breast cancer recruited between October 2010 and April 2016 from a single cancer center , prospective database. Of these patients who met the inclusion criteria , 2317 ( 74.4 %) had no SLN pathological metastasis. In the univariate analysis , other 798 patient with positive SLN tended to be under age 40 and premenopausal , having large tumor sizes ( > 2 cm) , higher histological grade of primary tumor , positive hormone receptors , and negative HER-2 status ( P < .05 for all). In the multivariate analysis , menstrual status , tumor size , ER status and histological types of primary tumor remained to be independent predictors for SLN pathological metastasis. The area under curve ( AUC) was 0.658 ( 95 % CI = 0.637-0.679) , P > .05. In conclusion , only a 74.4 % consistency between ALN ultrasonography-negative results and negative pathological SLN results , although menstrual status , tumor size , histologic subtypes of primary tumor and ER status were found to be statistically independent predictors of positive SLN among patients negative for ALN ultrasonography. Therefore , the present study suggests that negative ultrasound results of ALN do not adequately predict the negative pathology results of SLN in breast cancer patients.
