  Because defects are ubiquitous in materials , they may play an important role in affecting the performance of materials in practical applications. Here , we investigate the influence of point defects on the diffusion of molecules including water , hydrocarbons , and acid gases in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 ( ZIF-8) using molecular simulations. To make these simulations possible , we introduce a force field that extends previous descriptions of pristine ZIF-8 to include experimentally relevant point defects. In general , the point defects we examined increase the local hopping rate for molecular diffusion , suggesting that low concentrations of these defects will not dominate long-range molecular diffusion in ZIF-8.
