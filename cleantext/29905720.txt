  We present a Lyman-α laser developed for cooling trapped antihydrogen. The system is based on a pulsed Ti: sapphire laser operating at 729 nm that is frequency doubled using an LBO crystal and then frequency tripled in a Kr/Ar gas cell. After frequency conversion , this system produces up to 5.7 μW of average power at the Lyman-α wavelength. This laser is part of the ATRAP experiment at the antiproton decelerator in CERN.
