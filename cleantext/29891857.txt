  Bone loss induced by microgravity is a substantial barrier to humans in long-term spaceflight. Recent studies have revealed that icariin ( ICA) can attenuate osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and ovariectomized rats. However , whether ICA can protect against microgravity-induced bone loss remains unknown. In this study , the effects of ICA on a hindlimb suspension rodent model were investigated. Two-month-old female Wistar rats were hindlimb suspended and treated with ICA ( 25 mg Â· kg
