  We aimed to describe the age- and sex-specific distributions of gait speed and to evaluate associations with longitudinal outcomes in Korean rural community-dwelling older adults. A total of 1,348 people ( mean age: 76 years , 55 % women) in the population-based , prospective cohort of Aging Study of Pyeongchang Rural Area ( ASPRA) between October 2014 and June 2017. All participants underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment , including 4-m usual gait speed , and were followed annually. Among the 1,348 participants , women had a slower gait speed than men ( mean 0.709 m/s vs 0.850 m/s , Gait speed was related to age , sex , frailty status , and geriatric health outcomes in Korean rural community-dwelling older adults. Since this gait-speed distribution in an older Korean population differs from previous data on other populations , we should consider a gait-speed cutoff value based on sex-specific quartiles to prevent misclassification in sarcopenia and frailty diagnosis.
