  In this study , a slurry photocatalytic membrane reactor ( PMR) was developed and evaluated for the degradation of aqueous phenanthrene ( PHE). During continuous process with a hydraulic retention time ( HRT) of 140 min , the maximum PHE degradation and total organic carbon ( TOC) removal efficiencies were found to be 97 % and 79 % , respectively. The reuse and recovery potential of TiO
