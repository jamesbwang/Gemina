  The cranial cruciate ligament rupture ( CCLR) is the most commonly encountered orthopedic condition in dogs. Among the various techniques to treat this condition , tibial tuberosity advancement ( TTA) has been used to obtain rapid recovery of the affected knee. The objective of this study was to evaluate the viability of the use of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSC) implanted in the osteotomy site obtained by TTA in nine dogs diagnosed with CCLR. The MSC were isolated from the adipose tissue of the dogs and cultured for eight days , the animals were divided into two groups. Animals from the treated group ( GT) received cell transport medium containing about 1.5 millions MSC , and the animals from the control group ( GC) received only the cell transport medium. The study was performed in a double-blind manner using radiographs acquired on days 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 after the procedure. Evaluations of the density of the trabecular bone were performed using image analysis software. The results were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis , followed by the normality test , Chi-square test , Mann-Whitney test and Tukey 's multiple comparison test for p ≤ 0.05. After 30 days of the procedure , the animals of the GT presented an ossification mean 36.45 % greater ( p ≤ 0.033) than the GC , and there were no statistical differences for the other periods. Despite the total bone ossification within the expected period , there was no minimization of the estimated recovery time with the application of MSC , and inflammatory factors should be considered for reassessment of the therapeutic intervention time.
