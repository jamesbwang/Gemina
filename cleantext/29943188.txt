  There is evidence that vitamin D may play a role in the osteoarthritis ( OA) pathogenesis , but the few data available are limited to X-rays and clinical findings. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a higher intake of vitamin D was associated with a better architecture of the cartilage of the knee , assessed with magnetic resonance ( MRI) , in a large cohort from North<pathogen> America. 783 participants ( 59.8 % females; mean age: 62.3 years) with an MRI assessment from the Osteoarthritis Initiative were included. Vitamin D dietary intake was calculated as the sum of food and oral supplementation. A coronal 3D FLASH with Water Excitation MR sequence of the right knees was used. The strength of the association between dietary vitamin D intake and knee MRI parameters was investigated through an adjusted linear regression analysis , reported as standardized betas with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). Using a linear regression analysis , adjusted for ten potential confounders , higher vitamin D intake ( reported as an increase in one standard deviation , = 250 IU) corresponded to significantly higher values of mean cartilage thickness and volume of cartilage at medial tibia , volume of cartilage and mean cartilage thickness at central lateral femur , volume of cartilage and mean cartilage thickness at central medial femur , and volume of cartilage and mean cartilage thickness at central medial tibial-femoral compartment. Higher vitamin D intake is associated with a significantly better architecture of the cartilage of the knee , also independently taking in account from several potential confounders.
