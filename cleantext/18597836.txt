  To evaluate the mid-term results of clitoroplasty through the reduction of the length and diameter of the corpus cavernosum , as well as the volume of the glans. From October 2003 to July 2015 , we performed 29 clitoroplasties using the described procedure. The median ( range) age of the patients was 18 ( 3-47) months. After surgery we evaluated the volume of the clitoris , the appearance of glans , and its sensitivity to light touch , pressure , and pain. The length of the apparent part of the glans remained large ( > 10 mm) in four patients ( 14 %) , was an average size ( between 5 and 10 mm) in 11 ( 39 %) , and small ( < 5 mm) in 13 ( 46 %). The length of the corpus cavernosum was < 20 mm and its diameter < 5 mm in all cases. The sensitivity of the reduced clitoris to touch , pressure and pain seemed normal in all patients. In addition , we never found the circumflex arteries and nerves of the penis ( on histological examination of excised pieces of corpus cavernosum) in all children operated on during the first 3 years of life. The circumflex arteries of the penis begin to develop , only after the fourth year. This anatomical finding is an argument for performing clitoroplasty at an early age to avoid any risk of intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. The sensitivity of the clitoral glans appeared to be normal in all cases , with a good cosmetic appearance of the external genitalia in most patients.
