  We examined the longterm effectiveness of corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid injections in relieving symptoms among persons with knee osteoarthritis ( OA). Using Osteoarthritis Initiative data , a new-user design was applied to identify participants initiating corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid injections ( n = 412). Knee symptoms ( pain , stiffness , function) were measured using The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC). We used marginal structural models adjusting for time-varying confounders to estimate the effect on symptoms of newly initiated injection use compared to nonusers over 2 years of followup. Among 412 participants initiating injections , 77.2 % used corticosteroid injections and 22.8 % used hyaluronic acid injections. About 18.9 % had additional injection use after initiation , but switching between injection types was common. Compared to nonusers , on average , participants initiating a corticosteroid injection experienced a worsening of pain ( yearly worsening: 1.24 points , 95 % CI 0.82-1.66) , stiffness ( yearly worsening: 0.30 points , 95 % CI 0.10-0.49) , and physical functioning ( yearly worsening: 2.62 points , 95 % CI 0.94-4.29) after adjusting for potential confounders with marginal structural models. Participants initiating hyaluronic acid injections did not show improvements of WOMAC subscales ( pain: 0.50 , 95 % CI -0.11 to 1.11; stiffness: -0.07 , 95 % CI -0.38 to 0.24; and functioning: 0.49 , 95 % CI -1.34 to 2.32). Although intraarticular injections may support the effectiveness of reducing symptoms in short-term clinical trials , the initiation of corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid injections did not appear to provide sustained symptom relief over 2 years of followup for persons with knee OA.
