  Macrophages are key cell types of innate immunity and play a central role in inflammation<symptom> and host defense. Leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor-1 ( LAIR-1) is highly expressed on macrophages and regulates macrophage functions in several conditions. However , whether LAIR-1 is involved in governing macrophage polarization is still not clear. Here , we investigated the effect of LAIR-1 on macrophage polarization using human macrophage polarization model with THP-1 cells. It was found that LAIR-1 was highly expressed in THP-1 macrophages. IFN-Î³ reduced LAIR-1 expression in THP-1 macrophages. However , IL-4 did not have an effect on the expression of LAIR-1. Moreover , activation of LAIR-1 significantly inhibited the proinflammatory M1-like macrophage differentiation and promoted alternative activation of macrophages. Therefore , LAIR-1 may play critical roles in macrophage polarization. This study provides a rationale for macrophage polarization and sheds light on homeostatic mechanism in which LAIR-1 activation can terminate inflammation<symptom> which may be impaired in patients with autoimmune disease.
