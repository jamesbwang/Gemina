  The aim of this study was to investigate clozapine use and its associated adverse effects in patients in Japan. We analyzed data recorded from July 2009 to January 2016 ( N = 3780 patients) in the Clozaril Patient Monitoring Service , which was established in Japan in 2009 and includes all Japanese patients who have been prescribed clozapine. The treatment discontinuation rate was 23.9 % ( 869/3780 cases). The average ± SD treatment duration was 234.9 ± 306.9 days ( median , 115 days) , and the average ± SD dosage was 186.41 ± 151.6 mg/d. The estimated treatment continuation rates resulting from all-cause discontinuation were 78.2 after 1 year and 72.9 % after 2 years of treatment. The incidence of neutropenia/leucopenia was 5.4 % ( 206/3780 cases). The average ± SD dose before discontinuation was 233.36 ± 168.15 mg ( median , 200 mg; range , 4-600 mg). The incidence of glucose intolerance was 15.4 % ( 583/3780 cases). Of 3780 patients , 98 ( 2.67 %) developed glucose intolerance before and after taking clozapine administration , whereas 485 patients ( 12.8 %) developed glucose intolerance after taking clozapine. The average ± SD time from treatment initiation to new onset of glucose intolerance was 382.2 ± 420.2 days ( median , 216 days; range , 4-2053 days). The data obtained in this study , particularly regarding the incidence of clozapine-induced adverse events , will enable the optimal and safe use of clozapine in Japanese patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
