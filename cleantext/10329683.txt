  KCa3 .1 ( also known as SK4 or IK1) is a mammalian intermediate-conductance potassium channel that plays a critical role in the activation of T cells , B cells , and mast cells , effluxing potassium ions to maintain a negative membrane potential for influxing calcium ions. KCa3 .1 shares primary sequence similarity with three other ( low-conductance) potassium channels: KCa2 .1 , KCa2 .2 , and KCa2 .3 ( also known as SK1-3). These four homotetrameric channels bind calmodulin ( CaM) in the cytoplasmic region , and calcium binding to CaM triggers channel activation. Unique to KCa3 .1 , activation also requires phosphorylation of a single histidine residue , His358 , in the cytoplasmic region , which relieves copper-mediated inhibition of the channel. Near the cytoplasmic C-terminus of KCa3 .1 ( and KCa2.1-2.3) , secondary-structure analysis predicts the presence of a coiled-coil/heptad repeat. Here , we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal coiled-coil region of KCa3 .1 , which forms a parallel four-helix bundle , consistent with the tetrameric nature of the channel. Interestingly , the four copies of a histidine residue , His389 , in an ` a ' position within the heptad repeat , are observed to bind a copper ion along the four-fold axis of the bundle. These results suggest that His358 , the inhibitory histidine in KCa3 .1 , might coordinate a copper ion through a similar binding mode.
