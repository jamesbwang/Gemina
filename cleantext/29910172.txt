  To present anatomical variations of left internal spermatic vein and a comparison between treatments with hydrogel-coated and non-coated platinum coils in patients with varicocele. A total of 153 men ( mean age , 27.5 ± 6.7 ( SD) years; range: 18-45 years) with left sided varicocele underwent coil embolization. Anatomic variants of gonadal vein were categorized into five subtypes ( I-V). Additional venous collaterals were also recorded. Three types of coils were used ( hydrogel coated platinum coils , fibered coils and non-coated platinum coils). Technical success , tolerance , efficacy and safety of hydrogel coated platinum coils were recorded. Comparison between different types of coils used was made. Fisher 's exact test was used for statistical analysis. Varicoceles were classified as type I ( 26.1 %) , type II ( 13.7 %) , type III ( 32.1 %) , type IV ( 18.3 %) and type V ( 9.8 %). The internal spermatic vein- renal vein angle ranged from 32 ° -128 ° ( mean angle , 93.5 °). Technical success was achieved in 145 patients ( 94.8 %) without complications. The mean number of coils used was 3 ( range: 1-6 coils). A total of 260 hydrogel coated platinum coils in 95 patients and 135 non-coated coils in 50 patients were deployed with no complications. No differences were noted between the different types of coils used regarding embolic efficacy and safety. A 6.2 % ( 9/145) recurrence rate and a 33.3 % ( 14/42) fertility rate were observed. Clinical success regarding symptom relief after painful varicocele embolization was 100 % ( 36/36) for technically successful cases. Varicocele embolization with the use of hydrogel coated or non-coated platinum coils is technically feasible and safe without complications. No superiority of one type of coil over the other was found.
