  We report a robust and modular synthetic route to heterometallic rare earth-transition metal complexes. We have used the redox-active bridging ligand 1,10-phenathroline-5,6-dione ( pd) , which has selective N , N ' or O , O ' binding sites as the template for this synthetic route. The coordination complexes ( Ln ( hfac) 3 ( N , N '- pd)) ( Ln = Y ( 1) , Gd ( 2); hfac = hexafluoroacetylacetonate) were synthesised in high yield. These complexes have been fully characterised using a range of spectroscopic techniques. Solid state molecular structures of 1 and 2 have been determined by X-ray crystallography and display different pd binding modes in coordinating and non-coordinating solvents. Complexes 1 and 2 are unusually highly coloured in coordinating solvents , for example the vis-NIR spectrum of 1 in acetonitrile displays an electronic transition centred at 587 nm with an extinction coefficient consistent with significant charge transfer. The reaction between 1 and 2 and VCp2 or VCpt2 ( Cpt = tetramethylcyclopentadienyl) resulted in the isolation of the heterobimetallic complexes , ( Ln ( hfac) 3 ( N , N '- O , O '- pd) VCp2) ( Ln = Y ( 3) , Gd ( 4)) or ( Ln ( hfac) 3 ( N , N '- O , O '- pd) VCpt2) ( Ln = Y ( 5) , Gd ( 6)). The solid state molecular structures of 3 , 5 and 6 have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The spectroscopic data on 3-6 are consistent with oxidation of V ( ii) to V ( iv) and reduction of pd to pd2- in the heterobimetallic complexes. The spin-Hamiltonian parameters from low temperature X-band EPR spectroscopy of 3 and 5 describe a 2A1 ground state , with a V ( iv) centre. DFT calculations on 3 are in good agreement with experimental data and confirm the SOMO as the dx2-y2 orbital localised on vanadium.
