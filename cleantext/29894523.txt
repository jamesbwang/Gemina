  Multispectral digital skin<symptom> lesion<symptom> analysis ( MSDSLA) is both sensitive and specific in the detection of malignant melanoma by dermatologists and nondermatologists , and data have shown that MSDSLA can be a valuable tool in the evaluation of pigmented skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> ( PSLs). This study aimed to aggregate data from 7 prior studies to provide a comprehensive overview and evaluate the consistency of the effects of MSDSLA when used in conjunction with clinical examination and dermoscopy to evaluate PSLs.
