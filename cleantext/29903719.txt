  To examine for an opening effect on the blood-brain barrier ( BBB) in intact rats and rats with experimental ischaemia-reperfusion ( I/R) during the recovery period after various electroacupuncture ( EA) treatments with different time courses , and to determine whether there is a time-dependent effect. An additional objective was to determine whether this method could induce the penetration of nerve growth factor ( NGF) through the BBB. A middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO) model was first established. We chose different stimulation time courses and observed the effects of EA treatment ( 100 Hz frequency; 2 mA intensity) at GV20 and GV26 on the BBB in rats recovering from MCAO 3 weeks after modelling. The rats were injected with 2 % Evans blue ( EB) saline. The brain water content was measured using a wet/dry weighing method. The degree of penetration of EB was detected using spectrophotometry and laser confocal microscopy. The rats were then injected with NGF , and the concentration of NGF in the brain tissues was measured using ELISA. The increase in the BBB permeability was most notable following the 8 min EA stimulation ( P < 0.05) , which may be advantageous for the targeted delivery of drugs ( such as NGF) into the brain. Additionally , this effect did not appear to cause brain oedema ( P > 0.05) in healthy or MCAO rats. EA treatment for a certain stimulation time at GV20 and GV26 in MCAO rats can increase BBB permeability.
