  To explore the genetic cause and clinical features of a neonate with bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. The patient was examined thoroughly. Following the extraction of genomic DNA , next generation sequencing was performed to analyze the genetic cause. The patient manifested generalized erythema , blistering , and extensive exfoliation of the skin. A heterozygous missence 482T > G mutation was found in the first exon of KRT10 gene , which led to a p.L161W alteration in its protein product. The de novo mutation of the KRT10 gene probably underlies the disease in the child.
