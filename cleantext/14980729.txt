  Studies show that different types of training have a significant role in reducing both new and traditional risk factors of cardiovascular diseases , and the new risk factors are more sensitive and accurate in predicting such diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of resistance and endurance exercises on risk factors of vascular inflammation<symptom> and atherogenesis in non-athlete men. Thirty-six non-athlete male students ( mean age: 20.45 ± 1.20 years; mean body mass index: 23.66 ± 3.65 kg/m The results indicated a significant reduction in total cholesterol levels in both RT and ET groups. Also high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increased in both training groups. In addition , following 8 weeks , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in ET group was significantly decreased , whereas these training methods have had no significant effects on the new cardiovascular biomarkers ( hs-CRP , IL-6 , and sICAM-1). It seems that both ET and RT with improvement in lipid profiles could be effective in prevention and treatment of the cardiovascular disease.
