  Musculoskeletal birth defects are frequent , yet their causes remain insufficiently investigated. Aside from genetic factors , exposure to environmental toxicants is suspected to contribute to the etiology of skeletal malformations. However , most chemicals in the environment are insufficiently characterized for their potential to cause harm to the differentiation of osteoblasts , the bone-forming cells and thereby the development of the skeleton.This lack of information primarily stems from animal testing being prohibitively expensive and time-consuming , which has prompted the development of predictive in vitro alternative methods. With the advent of mouse embryonic stem cells , which represent cells with the potential to become any of the 200 cell types in the body , among them osteoblasts , the past 15 years have borne suitable opportunities to assess chemicals in vitro. However , with an increasing understanding of the differences between mouse and human embryonic development , a need for human-specific developmental toxicity testing has risen. This chapter provides a detailed protocol on how to differentiate human embryonic stem cells into the osteogenic lineage , how to assess differentiation inhibition and how to evaluate such findings in relation to the mitochondrial activity of human embryonic stem cells and human fibroblasts , while exposed to a potential toxicant. Together , these endpoints allow for a human-specific screening of developmental toxicity specifically related to the osteogenic lineage.
