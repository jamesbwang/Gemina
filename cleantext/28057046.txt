  Whether the dynamic change of neutrophil to lymphocyte<symptom> ratio ( delta-NLR) can predict the outcome in various malignancies remained controversial. The delta-NLR has not been evaluated in colon cancer. Thus , we conducted the study to evaluate the predictive value of the delta-NLR in patients with colon cancer who underwent curative resection. Three-hundred and fifty-four patients with stage I-III colon cancer were retrospectively analysed. Clinicopathological features , preoperative NLR and postoperative NLR were collected. Prognostic factors were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. The one , three and five-year overall survival rate in the delta-NLR < 0 group was 98.2 % , 90.7 % and 83.6 % , respectively; and in the delta-NLR â‰¥ 0 group was 98.4 % , 96.9 % and 95.3 % , respectively ( log-rank test , P = 0.002). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that there was a strong relationship between delta-NLR and overall survival. In conclusion , the delta-NLR was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in early stage colon cancer. Patients with increased delta-NLR had an favourable clinical outcome.
