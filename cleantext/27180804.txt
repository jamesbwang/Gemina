  The complete mitochondrial genome ( mitogenome) of Ugyops sp. ( Hemiptera: Delphacidae) was sequenced , making it the first determined mitogenome from the subfamily Asiracinae , the basal clade of the family Delphacidae. The mitogenome was 15,259 bp in length with A + T content of 77.65 % and contained 13 protein-coding genes ( PCGs) , 22 transfer RNA genes ( tRNAs) , two ribosomal RNA genes ( rRNAs) , and a control region. The gene order was identical with that of the ancestral insect. The nucleotide composition analysis indicated that the whole mitogenome was strongly A-skewed ( 0.288) and highly C-skewed ( -0.270). For PCGs on the J-strand , the AT skew was positive , and the GC skew was negative. All PCGs started with canonical ATN codons , except for cox1 and nad5 , which used CTG and GTG as start codon , respectively. All tRNAs could fold into typical cloverleaf secondary structures , with the exception of trnS1 ( AGN) , in which the dihydrouridine arm was reduced to a simple loop. The control region included a poly-T stretch downstream of the small rRNA gene ( rrnS) , a subregion of higher A + T content and tandemly repeated sequence near trnI. The mitogenome of Ugyops sp. could be very helpful in exploring the diversity and evolution of mitogenomes in Delphacidae.
