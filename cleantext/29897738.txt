  Noncoding RNAs engage in numerous biological activities including gene regulation. To fully understand RNA function it is necessary to probe biologically relevant conformations in living cells. To address this challenge , we coupled RNA-mediated regulation of the green fluorescent protein ( GFP) uv-reporter gene to icSHAPE ( in cell Selective 2 '- Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension). Our transcript-specific approach provides sensitive , fluorescence-based readout of the regulatory-RNA status as a means to coordinate chemical modification experiments. We chose a plasmid-based reporter compatible with Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> to allow use of knockout strains that eliminate endogenous effector biosynthesis. The approach was piloted using the Lactobacillus<pathogen> rhamnosus<pathogen> ( Lrh) preQ
