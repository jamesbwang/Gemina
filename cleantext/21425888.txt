  Eccentric ( ECC) contractions are used to maintain skeletal muscle mass and strength in healthy subjects and patients. Here we investigated the effects of ECC training induced by electrical stimulation ( ES) on muscle wasting in colon 26 ( C-26) tumor-bearing mice. Mice were divided into four groups: control ( CNT) , CNT + ECC , C-26 , and C-26 + ECC. Cancer cachexia was induced by a subcutaneous injection of C-26 cells and developed for four weeks. In experiment 1 , muscle protein synthesis rate and mammalian target of rapamycin complex ( mTORC) 1 signaling were investigated six hours after one bout of ECC-ES ( 2 s contraction given every 6 s , 20 Â°/ s , 4 sets of 5 contractions). In experiment 2 , ECC-ES training , a total of 14 sessions , was performed every other day starting one day after C-26 injection. Compared to the CNT mice , the gastrocnemius muscle<symptom> weight was significantly decreased in the tumor-bearing mice. This change was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis rate and a marked increase in the expression levels of genes including regulated in development and DNA damage responses ( REDD) 1 , forkhead box protein O1 ( FoxO1) , muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1 , and muscle ring finger 1 ( MuRF-1) mRNA. ECC-ES increased the protein synthesis rate and the phosphorylation levels of p70S6K ( Thr389) and rpS6 ( Ser240/244) , markers for mTORC1 signaling , and reversed an upregulation of MuRF-1 mRNA in muscles from C-26 mice. Our findings suggest that ECC-ES training reduces skeletal muscle atrophy in C-26 tumor-bearing mice through activation of mTORC1 signaling and the inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Thus , ECC-ES training might be used to effectively ameliorate muscle wasting in patients with cancer cachexia.
