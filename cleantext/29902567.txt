  The aim of this study was to study the relationship between MRSI , before and after surgery , and patient survival. The accuracy of pre-operative MRSI in differentiating low- from high-grade oligodendrogliomas ( ODGs) was also studied. Two hundred patients with ODG were retrospectively included in this study between 2000 and 2016. All patients underwent MRSI before any treatment or biopsy and/or after surgery for an intra-axial brain tumour. The R software was used for statistical data analysis. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated for patients with low-grade ODG and high-grade ODG pre- and post-operatively , to study survival ( overall survival , OS). The best threshold of each MRSI metabolite ratio was obtained using receiver operating characteristic curves ( ROCs). One hundred patients underwent pre-operative MRSI and 170 post-operative MRSI. N-acetylaspartate ( NAA) , lactate ( Lac) , choline ( Cho) and creatine ( Cr) were measured. Kapan-Meier curves showed that survival was poorer for a nCho/Cr > 3.02 in the pre-operative and nCho/Cr > 2.04 , Lac/Cr > 0.743 and nCho/NAA > 3.63 in the post-operative period. Post-operative MRSI predicts survival better than pre-operative MRSI. nCho/Cr and Lac/Cr distinguished low- from high-grade ODG with a good positive predictive value. MRSI is associated with survival. It is a non-invasive tool which completes histopathology and can predict patients ' prognosis , thus improving patient management.
