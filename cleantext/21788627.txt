  The Mediterranean Diet ( MedDiet) has been acknowledged as a healthy diet. However , its relation with risk of major chronic<disease> diseases<disease> in non-Mediterranean countries is inconclusive. The Nordic diet is proposed as an alternative across Northern Europe , although its associations with the risk of chronic<disease> diseases<disease> remain controversial. We aimed to investigate the association between the Nordic diet and the MedDiet with the risk of chronic<disease> disease<disease> ( type 2 diabetes ( T2D) , myocardial infarction ( MI) , stroke , and cancer) in the EPIC-Potsdam cohort. The EPIC-Potsdam cohort recruited 27,548 participants between 1994 and 1998. After exclusion of prevalent cases , we evaluated baseline adherence to a score reflecting the Nordic diet and two MedDiet scores ( tMDS , reflecting the traditional MedDiet score , and the MedPyr score , reflecting the MedDiet Pyramid). Cox regression models were applied to examine the association between the diet scores and the incidence of major chronic<disease> diseases<disease>. During a follow-up of 10.6 years , 1376 cases of T2D , 312 of MI , 321 of stroke , and 1618 of cancer were identified. The Nordic diet showed a statistically non-significant inverse association with incidence of MI in the overall population and of stroke in men. Adherence to the MedDiet was associated with lower incidence of T2D ( HR per 1 SD 0.93 , 95 % CI 0.88-0.98 for the tMDS score and 0.92 , 0.87-0.97 for the MedPyr score). In women , the MedPyr score was also inversely associated with MI. No association was observed for any of the scores with cancer. In the EPIC-Potsdam cohort , the Nordic diet showed a possible beneficial effect on MI in the overall population and for stroke in men , while both scores reflecting the MedDiet conferred lower risk of T2D in the overall population and of MI in women.
