  Superior semicircular canal dehiscence is a rare inner ear disorder characterized by an abnormal third opening between the superior semicircular canal and middle fossa. Symptoms include amplification of internal sounds<symptom> , aural fullness , tinnitus<symptom> , hearing loss , autophony , sound-induced vertigo<symptom> ( Tullio phenomenon) , pressure-induced vertigo<symptom> ( Hennebert sign) , disequilibrium , nystagmus<symptom> , oscillopsia , and headache<symptom> While no cure exists for SSCD , surgical treatment has proven to effectively minimize these symptoms. This study reviewed brainstem auditory evoked potentials ( BAEPs) that were monitored intraoperatively to better understand hearing loss risks associated with surgical treatment for SSCD. A retrospective chart review was conducted at the University of California , Los Angeles on adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SSCD who had undergone a middle cranial fossa repair from March 2011 to October 2017. A total of 142 cases of SSCD in 118 patients were repaired. The majority of patients ' BAEPs remained stable and had no intraoperative hearing changes ( n = 135; 95.1 %). Seven patients experienced intraoperative changes as determined by a prolongation and reduction of Wave V latency ( 4.9 %). Of these seven cases , five experienced a return to baseline prior to the end of surgery , and had no post-operative changes in hearing ( 71.4 %). Overall , only two of the 142 surgeries ( 1.4 %) resulted in failure to normalize and , as such , these patients experienced permanent changes in hearing. The results of this retrospective review demonstrate a low risk for hearing loss due to SSCD surgery via the middle fossa craniotomy approach.
