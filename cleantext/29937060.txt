  We have developed versatile methods toward the synthesis of a variety of piperidine/piperazine bridged isosteres of pridopidine. The compounds were assessed against the D2 receptor in agonist and antagonist modes and against the D4 receptor in agonist mode. hERG Binding and the ADME profiles were studied.
