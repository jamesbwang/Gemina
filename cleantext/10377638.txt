  BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of 2 different esthetic post materials on the final color of direct-composite restorations by using a digital technique under in vivo conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS We included 22 pulpless incisor teeth treated with conventionally cemented zirconia ( n = 11) and polyethylene fiber ( n = 11) posts in the study. Teeth were restored with a hybrid resin. The color of direct-composite restorations and contralateral control teeth was measured using a digital technique. The Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage , or CIE , L * a * b * and RGB color systems were investigated. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed for the CIE L * a * b * values. Color differences ( ΔE) for the average L * , a * , and b * color parameters between every pair of groups were calculated ( P > .05). RESULTS Significant differences were not found in the color difference luminosity ( lum) , R , G , B , and L * a * b * values between the zircon-rich glass fiber post ( Z) and contralateral control teeth ( Cz) ( P > .05) and between the polyethylene fiber post ( P) and contralateral control teeth ( Cp) ( P > .05). However , there was a statistically significant difference between the color a * values of the polyethylene fiber post ( P) and contralateral control teeth ( Cp) ( p < 0.05). Color differences ( ΔE) between the zircon-rich glass fiber post ( Z) and contralateral control teeth , and the polyethylene fiber post ( P) and contralateral teeth were not statistically significant ( P > .05). CONCLUSIONS Definitive restorations were equally affected by the 2 materials. Both materials can be used reliably in clinical practice. However , further research that focuses on the effect of intraoral conditions is needed.
