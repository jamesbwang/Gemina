  Laterality is a key aspect of the analysis of basic and specific motor skills. It is relevant to sports because it involves motor laterality profiles beyond left-right preference and spatial orientation of the body. The aim of this study was to obtain the laterality profiles of young athletes , taking into account the synergies between the support and precision functions of limbs and body parts in the performance of complex motor skills. We applied two instruments: ( a) MOTORLAT , a motor laterality inventory comprising 30 items of basic , specific , and combined motor skills , and ( b) the Precision and Agility Tapping over Hoops ( PATHoops) task , in which participants had to perform a path by stepping in each of 14 hoops arranged on the floor , allowing the observation of their feet , left-right preference and spatial orientation. A total of 96 young athletes performed the PATHoops task and the 30 MOTORLAT items , allowing us to obtain data about limb dominance and spatial orientation of the body in the performance of complex motor skills. Laterality profiles were obtained by means of a cluster analysis and a correlational analysis and a contingency analysis were applied between the motor skills and spatial orientation actions performed. The results obtained using MOTORLAT show that the combined motor skills criterion ( for example , turning while jumping) differentiates athletes ' uses of laterality , showing a clear tendency toward mixed laterality profiles in the performance of complex movements. In the PATHoops task , the best spatial orientation strategy was `` same way '' ( same foot and spatial wing) followed by `` opposite way '' ( opposite foot and spatial wing) , in keeping with the research assumption that actions unfolding in a horizontal direction in front of an observer 's eyes are common in a variety of sports.
