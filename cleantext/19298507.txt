  Spray drying is a widely used method for producing milk powder. This process is not aimed to cause microbial inactivation , thus sporeforming bacteria may be abundant in the microbiota of milk powder. The first aim of this study was to determine the inactivation kinetics parameters in capillary tubes of three
