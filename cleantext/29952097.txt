  We use a ` Virtual Clinic ' for follow up of hip and knee replacement patients. The aim of this study was to investigate patient compliance , pain and function , revision rates and surgeon experience using this system. All hip and knee replacements conducted from 2000 onwards were suitable for ` Virtual Clinic ' review. Between July 2014 and December 2016 , all patients due for follow up ( at 1 , 5 and 7 years post-operatively , or biennially thereafter) were mailed an Oxford Hip or Knee Score and a request for a radiograph. A surgeon reviewed the questionnaire and radiograph and decided whether face-to-face review was necessary. We calculated compliance as the percentage of eligible patients who completed the ` Virtual Clinic '. We used retrospective review of medical records for all clinic participants to analyse Oxford scores , disposition following appointment , and revision rates. We reviewed all clinic participants in December 2017 to identify any further revisions. Surgeon feedback was assessed by emailed survey. A total of 2076 patients were due for follow up. 1405 patients were contactable , and 710 completed the process. We calculated a 36 % compliance rate. Surgeons decided 162 ( 23 %) patients with a mean Oxford score of 24.2 required face-to-face assessment. This identified 13 patients needing revision. One other patient was revised for loosening which developed between ` Virtual Clinic ' appointments. Surgeon feedback indicated the inclusion of a ` comment ' section on the questionnaire as particularly useful. We describe our adoption of a ` Virtual Clinic ' for joint replacement follow up. We recommend this system as a practical method of following up patients.
