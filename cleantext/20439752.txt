  PKD2 and PKD1 genes are mutated in human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. PKD2 can form either a homomeric cation channel or a heteromeric complex with the PKD1 receptor , presumed to respond to ligand ( s) and/or mechanical stimuli. Here , we identify a two-residue hydrophobic gate in PKD2L1 , and a single-residue hydrophobic gate in PKD2. We find that a PKD2 gain-of-function gate mutant effectively rescues PKD2 knockdown-induced phenotypes in embryonic zebrafish. The structure of a PKD2 activating mutant F604P by cryo-electron microscopy reveals a π- to α-helix transition within the pore-lining helix S6 that leads to repositioning of the gate residue and channel activation. Overall the results identify hydrophobic gates and a gating mechanism of PKD2 and PKD2L1.
