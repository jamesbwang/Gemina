  Ossification of the ligamentum flavum of the spine ( OLF) is rarely reported in individuals of European ancestry. It has , however , been observed in archaeological skeletons from Europe. The aim of this study was to revisit OLF rates , utilising a mid-nineteenth-century skeletal sample from Ireland. The hypothesis was that the OLF prevalence rate was similar to studies on non-Europeans. Spines from 345 individuals were analysed , and the extent of OLF recorded on the cranial and caudal attachment sites of each vertebra using the following classification system: Grade 0 ( no change); Grade 1 ( < 2 mm); Grade 2 ( 2-4 mm); Grade 3 ( â‰¥ 4 mm). OLF was observed at prevalence rates of 83.6 %. There was no disparity in prevalence based on sex , except for individuals aged 36-45 years at death in which the male rate was higher. Advancing age was a determining factor in the OLF occurrence with an onset in young adulthood ( 18-25 years) , and most severe grades occurring over the age of 25 years. OLF coincides with spinal osteoarthritis , spondylosis deformans and Schmorl 's nodes in both sexes , and with intervertebral osteochondrosis in females. The results of this study indicate that OLF is likely to be an understudied rather than rare condition in European populations.
