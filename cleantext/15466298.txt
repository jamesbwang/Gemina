  This study investigates the effects of cannabinoid agonist WIN55-212-2 on acquisition and consolidation phases of the fear memory extinction and also on anxiety<symptom> and motor activity. In this study , we used SPS & S model to induce post-traumatic stress disorder. One week after SPS , to establish a conditioned fear memory , rats received an electric foot shock<symptom> within shock<symptom> chamber. After 24 h , for extinction training , the rats were placed back to the chamber for 9 min , without receiving any shock<symptom>. In 3 consecutive days and on days 17 , 24 and 37 , extinction tests were carried out and the freezing behavior was evaluated. Thirty minutes before the first three extinction tests , animals received IP injections of WIN or vehicle. Anxiety-like behavior examined with elevated plus-maze and motor activity with open field , 32 days after conditioning. Exaggerated and continued conditioned fear memory observed in SPS & S group compared with shock<symptom> group. IP injection of a 0.25 mg/kg dose of WIN before extinction training led to reducing fear responses in animals. IP injection of WIN increased acquisition or consolidation of fear memory extinction. SPS & S caused anxiety<symptom> and this effect improved by the agonist ( 0.25 mg/kg).
