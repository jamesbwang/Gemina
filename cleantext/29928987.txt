  Angiotensin ( 1-7) has been reported to be a ligand for the GPCR MAS1. Small molecule MAS1 modulators have also been recently characterized. Aside from convincing evidence for MAS1 activation of Gq signaling , little is known about MAS1 mediated signaling pathways initiated by these ligands , especially Ang ( 1-7). We performed a comprehensive characterization of recombinant MAS1 signaling induced by Ang ( 1-7) and small molecule ligands through numerous G protein-dependent and independent pathways , and in a signaling pathway agnostic approach. We find that small molecule ligands modulate numerous G protein-dependent and independent pathways through MAS1 , including Gq and Gi pathways , GTPγS binding , β-arrestin recruitment , Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation , arachidonic acid release , and receptor internalization. Moreover , in dynamic mass redistribution ( DMR) assays that provide a pathway-agnostic readout of cellular responses , small molecule agonists produced robust responses. In contrast , Ang ( 1-7) failed to induce or block signaling in any of these assay platforms. We detected specific binding of radiolabeled Ang ( 1-7) to rat aortic endothelial cell ( RAEC) membranes<symptom> , but not to recombinant MAS1. Biphasic , concentration-dependent biased signaling responses to Ang II were detected in RAEC. These phases were associated with vastly different DMR characteristics and this likely provides a molecular basis for previously observed concentration-dependent divergent physiological actions of Ang II. Both phases of Ang II signaling in RAECs were potently inhibited by Ang ( 1-7) , providing a plausible molecular mechanism for Ang ( 1-7) as counter regulator of the Ang II- AT1 axis , responsible at least in part for Ang ( 1-7) physiological activities.
