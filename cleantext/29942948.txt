  Protein S-sulfenylation is a type of reversible post-translational modification ( PTM) through which cysteine ( CYS) thiols of proteins are reversibly oxidized to cysteine sulfenic acids ( CSO). Recent studies have shown that this event plays an essential role in cell signaling , transcriptional regulation and protein functions. Therefore , the identification of S-sulfenylation sites is important to understand the functions of S-sulfenylated proteins. In this study , we proposed PredCSO , a computational method for predicting S-sulfenylation sites in proteins. PredCSO is built on four kinds of features , including position-specific scoring matrix , position-specific amino acid propensity , the absolute solvent accessibility and four-body statistical pseudo-potential. In particular , 21 crucial features were refined out using a two-step feature selection procedure consisting of a max-relevance algorithm and a sequential backward elimination algorithm. To overcome the problem of imbalanced sample sizes , we adopt an ensemble method , which combines bootstrap resampling , gradient tree boosting and majority voting. Our performance evaluation shows that PredCSO achieves state-of-the-art performance in identifying S-sulfenylation sites in proteins.
