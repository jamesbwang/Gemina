  The ability to predict which recipients will successfully complete their posttransplant clinical course , is crucial for liver transplant ( LT) programs. The assessment of natural killer ( NK) cell subset determined by flow cytometry from a monocentric series of consecutive liver perfusates ( LPs) could help identify risk factors portending adverse LT outcomes. LPs were collected during the back-table surgical time after the procurement procedures for donors after brain death ( DBDs). Lymphocytic concentrations and phenotypes were matched with DBD characteristics and indications , timing , surgical techniques , outcomes , and biopsy-proven acute cellular rejections ( ACRs) in 46 adult recipients who underwent LT between 2010 and 2014 at our institute. Cox regression models were used to study relevant risk factors in order to estimate hazard ratios ( HRs) for episodes of rejection after LT. Percentage of NK cells was significantly associated with donor age ( P = 0.05) and the percentage of NKT cellular subset ( P = 0.001). The length of follow-up after LT was 41.0 Â± 20.9 months , and 11 ( 23.9 %) recipients experienced biopsy-proven ACR. At time-to-rejection ( TTR) proportional regression analysis , A cut-off value of 33.7 % was optimal , with a sensitivity of 1 , specificity of 0.57 , and positive and negative predictive values of 0.42 and 1 , respectively. LP NK cell subset was strongly associated with biopsy-proven ACR ( HR = 10.7 , P = 0.02). LP cytofluorimetric phenotyping may contribute as a targeted preoperative tool to predict the risk of ACR , and as clinical test in translational studies that aim to improve donor allograft procurement and transplant outcomes.
