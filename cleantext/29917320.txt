  The current study aimed to determine the oncological efficacy and surgical safety of multiple pulmonary resections ( MPRs) after prior curative surgery for local regional recurrent or second primary lung cancers. All cases of lung cancer included in our prospective database between January 2000 and July 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The oncological efficacy endpoints for synchronous and metachronous MPR were five-year overall survival ( OS) , disease-free survival ( DFS) , and progression-free survival ( PFS) rates after the second surgery. The surgical safety endpoints were postoperative mortality and complications ( Clavien-Dindo classification) within 30 days. In total , 67 MPR cases were identified. There were no significant differences in the five-year OS and DFS between the synchronous MPR group ( n = 50) and the propensity score-matched solitary major pulmonary resection group ( n = 250) ( 5-year OS 84.5 % vs. 69.0 % , log rank P = 0.112; DFS 64.4 % vs. 58.0 % , log rank P = 0.278). The five-year OS and PFS of the metachronous MPR group ( n = 17) were significantly better than those in the non-surgical control group ( n = 19) ( 5-year OS 94.1 % vs. 50.7 % , log rank P = 0.005; 5-year PFS 53.9 % vs. 10.5 % , log rank P = 0.020). No postoperative mortality or severe complications occurred in the MPR group. The oncological efficacy of MPR is superior to the non-surgical approach for the management of local regional recurrent or second primary lung cancer , with comparable postoperative mortality and complications.
