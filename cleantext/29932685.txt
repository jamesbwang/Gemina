  We report electron spin resonance ( ESR) spectroscopy results on the double perovskite Ba _ ( 2) YIrO _ ( 6). On general grounds , this material is expected to be nonmagnetic due to the strong coupling of the spin and orbital momenta of Ir ^ ( 5 +) ( 5d ^ ( 4)) ions. However , controversial experimental reports on either strong antiferromagnetism with static order at low temperatures or just a weakly paramagnetic behavior have triggered a discussion on the breakdown of the generally accepted scenario of the strongly spin-orbit coupled ground states in the 5d ^ ( 4) iridates and the emergence of a novel exotic magnetic state. Our data evidence that the magnetism of the studied material is solely due to a few percent of Ir ^ ( 4 +) and Ir ^ ( 6 +) magnetic defects while the regular Ir ^ ( 5 +) sites remain nonmagnetic. Remarkably , the defect Ir ^ ( 6 +) species manifest magnetic correlations in the ESR spectra at T â‰² 20 K , suggesting a long-range character of superexchange in the double perovskites as proposed by recent theories.
