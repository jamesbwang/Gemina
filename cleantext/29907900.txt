  The management of anesthesia plays a central role in the treatment of thoracic trauma , both in the initial phase when safeguarding the difficult airway and in the intensive care unit. A rapid transfer to a trauma center should be considered in order to recognize and treat organ dysfunction in time. Development of atelectasis , pneumonia<disease> and acute lung failure are common pulmonary complications. Non-invasive ventilation combined with physiotherapy and respiratory training can help to minimize these pulmonary complications. If single lung ventilation is necessary as part of the operative patient care , a double-lumen tube , a bronchial blocker and the Univent Â®- Tubus ( Fuji Systems Corporation , Tokyo , Japan) can be used. Special attention should be paid to the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction that occurs in this maneuver. Pain therapy is ideally carried out patient-adapted with epidural anesthesia. In addition , intraoperatively inserted catheters in the sense of a continuous intercostal block or serratus plane block are good alternatives. The aim of these therapies should be early mobilization and transfer of the patient to rehabilitation.
