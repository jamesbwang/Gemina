  Vortices , phase singularities , and topological defects of any kind often reflect information that is crucial for understanding physical systems in which such entities arise. With near-field experiments supported by numerical calculations , we determine the fluctuations of the topological charge for phase singularities in isotropic random waves as a function of the size R of the observation window. We demonstrate that for two-dimensional fields such fluctuations increase with a superlinear scaling law , consistent with a R log R behavior. Additionally , we show that such scaling remains valid in the presence of anisotropy.
