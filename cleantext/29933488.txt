  Individuals with mild memory<symptom> impairments<symptom> often rely on external memory aids ( EMAs) to compensate for impaired cognitive abilities and to support independent completion of activities of daily living. These strategies are evidence based; however , professionals have limited knowledge regarding individual preferences and guidance on how to incorporate a person-centered approach into the EMA development phase. The purpose of the current study was to qualitatively investigate individuals ' preferences and experiences as they relate to EMAs. Data analysis included ( 1) evaluation of a posttreatment questionnaire to explore individual strategy preferences following intervention and ( 2) evaluation of group intervention videos using thematic coding to investigate individuals ' experiences with strategies during intervention. Results suggest that older adults with mild memory<symptom> impairments<symptom> have unique preferences and experiences , despite limited variability in demographic characteristics. Some themes that emerged included memory ability awareness and attitudes toward technology. Within a person-centered approach , skilled professionals must consider individuals ' unique needs , preferences , and experiences when developing strategies throughout the continuum of care to promote sustained EMA use within everyday settings.
