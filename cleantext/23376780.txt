  Trehalase is an indispensable component of insect hemolymph that plays important role in energy metabolism and stress resistance. In this study , we cloned and expressed the gene encoding soluble trehalase ( HaTreh-1) of Helicoverpa armigera ( cotton bollworm) and characterized the enzyme. HaTreh-1 had a full-length open reading frame encoding a protein of 571 amino acids. Sequence comparison indicated that HaTreh-1 was similar to some known insect trehalases. Two essential active sites ( D321 and E519) and three essential residues ( R168 , R221 , and R286) were conserved in HaTreh-1. The recombinant trehalase was expressed in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and purified by nickel exchange chromatography. Molecular weight of the recombinant protein was about 71 kDa , and the optimum HaTreh-1 enzyme activity is at 55 °C with pH 6.0. Enzymatic assays showed a Km value of 72.8 mmol/liter and a Vmax value of 0.608 mmol/ ( liter · min). Inhibition assays in vitro indicated that castanospermine , a polyhydroxylated alkaloid , was an effective competitive inhibitor of trehalase with a Ki value of 6.7 μmol/liter. The inhibitor action of castanospermine was linked to its modification effect on trehalase structure. The circular dichroism spectrum showed that the percentage of α-helix increased under the presence of castanospermine. Results of our study will aid in developing effective trehalase inhibitors for controlling H. armigera in the future.
