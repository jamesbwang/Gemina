  The purpose of this study is to report the results of a comprehensive etiological work-up for congenitally deaf children including targeted next generation sequencing. Retrospective case review. Tertiary referral center. Fifty children with congenital , bilateral profound hearing loss ( HL) ( > 90 dBnHL). Etiological work-up included testing for pathogenic variants in GJB2 , a phenotype driven genetic analysis , screening for congenital infections and imaging. When no etiology could be found , comprehensive genetic testing was performed using a HL gene panel including 45 syndromic and 96 non-syndromic HL genes. Eleven patients carried bi-allelic pathogenic variants in GJB2. Phenotype driven genetic analysis identified two homozygous KCNQ1 patients ( Jervell and Lange Nielsen syndrome<disease>) and one heterozygous CHD7 patient ( CHARGE syndrome<disease>). One patient was diagnosed with achondroplasia and one had a clinical diagnosis of Waardenburg syndrome<disease>. A deafness gene panel evaluated 16 patients. In 12 out of 16 , we identified a pathogenic ( n = 12) or likely pathogenic ( n = 2) variant and one variant of unknown significance ( VUS). A definite diagnosis of non-syndromic or syndromic HL was made in 18 and seven patients , respectively. Non-genetic causes were congenital cytomegalovirus infection ( n = 11) , anatomic abnormalities ( n = 2) , neurological/metabolic/polymalformative conditions ( n = 3) , meningitis<disease> ( n = 1) , and auditory neuropathy ( n = 1). A definite genetic cause was found in 25 ( 50 %) of congenital , bilaterally deaf children. Our data show that implementation of a gene panel improves the diagnostic yield for etiological work-up of congenital profound HL to 86 %. Identification of the etiology of congenital HL may contribute to predicting outcomes of cochlear implantation.
