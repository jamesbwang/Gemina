  Fourteen Trichoderma<pathogen> ( Hypocreales) species were identified during a survey of the genus in South Africa. These include T. afroharzianum , T. asperelloides , T. asperellum , T. atrobrunneum , T. atroviride , T. camerunense , T. gamsii , T. hamatum , T.<pathogen> koningii<pathogen> , T. koningiopsis , T. saturnisporum , T. spirale , T. virens , and T.<pathogen> viride<pathogen>. Ten of these species were not known to occur in South Africa prior to this investigation. Five additional species were novel and are described here as T. beinartii , T. caeruleimontis , T. chetii , T. restrictum , and T. undulatum. These novel Trichoderma<pathogen> species display morphological traits that are typical of the genus. Based on molecular identification using calmodulin , endochitinase , nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacers ( ITS1-5.8 S-ITS2) , RNA polymerase II subunit B , and translation elongation factor 1-Î± gene sequence data , T. beinartii , T. caeruleimontis , and T. chetii were found to belong to the Longibrachiatum<pathogen> clade , whereas T. restrictum is a member of the Hamatum clade. Trichoderma<pathogen> undulatum occupies a distinct lineage distantly related to other Trichoderma<pathogen> species. Strains of T. beinartii and T. chetii were isolated previously in Hawaii and Israel; however , T. caeruleimontis , T. restrictum , and T. undulatum are so far known only from South Africa.
