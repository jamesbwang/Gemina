  Patient-derived xenograft ( PDX) animal models allow the exogenous growth of human tumors , offering an irreplaceable preclinical tool for oncology research. Mice are the most commonly used host for human PDX models , however their small body size limits the xenograft growth , sample collection , and drug evaluation. Therefore , we sought to develop a novel rat model that could overcome many of these limitations. We knocked out Rag1 , Rag2 , and Il2rg in Sprague Dawley ( SD) rats by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR)- CRISPR-associated protein 9 technology. The development of lymphoid organs is significantly impaired in Rag1
