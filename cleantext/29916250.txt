  New polyphenylene-based dendronized polymers ( denpols) , exhibiting extended and rigid conformations , were prepared using ring-opening metathesis polymerization ( ROMP). Their mechanochemical degradation was explored in ultrasound-induced elongational flow fields. Degradation rate constants were obtained for polyphenylene-based denpols , of varying generation , across a degree of polymerization ( DP) range of âˆ¼ 100-600. In general , it was found that larger side chains led to increased degradation rates and that the rate enhancement was proportional to the natural log of persistence length ( Ln ( l
