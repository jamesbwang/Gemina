  Cutaneous<disease> wound<disease> repair is a highly coordinated cascade of cellular responses to injury which restores the epidermal integrity and its barrier functions. Even under optimal healing conditions , normal wound<disease> repair of adult human skin is imperfect and delayed healing and scarring are frequent occurrences. Dysregulated wound<disease> healing is a major concern for global healthcare , and , given the rise in diabetic and aging populations , this medicoeconomic disease burden will continue to rise. Therapies to reliably improve nonhealing wounds<disease> and reduce scarring are currently unavailable. Mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs) have emerged as a powerful technique to improve skin wound<disease> healing. Their differentiation potential , ease of harvest , low immunogenicity , and integral role in native wound<disease> healing physiology make MSCs an attractive therapeutic remedy. MSCs promote cell migration , angiogenesis , epithelialization , and granulation tissue formation , which result in accelerated wound<disease> closure. MSCs encourage a regenerative , rather than fibrotic , wound<disease> healing microenvironment. Recent translational research efforts using modern bioengineering approaches have made progress in creating novel techniques for stromal cell delivery into healing wounds<disease> This paper discusses experimental applications of various stromal cells to promote wound<disease> healing and discusses the novel methods used to increase MSC delivery and efficacy.
