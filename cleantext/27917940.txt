  Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( PPARs) belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily and they are essential regulators of cell differentiation , tissue development , and energy metabolism. Given their central roles in sensing the cellular metabolic state and controlling metabolic homeostasis , PPARs became important targets of drug development for the management of metabolic disorders. The function of PPARs is mainly regulated through ligand binding , which induces structural changes , further affecting the interactions with co-activators or co-repressors to stimulate or inhibit their functions. In addition , PPAR functions are also regulated by various Post-translational modifications ( PTMs). These PTMs include phosphorylation , SUMOylation , ubiquitination , acetylation , and
