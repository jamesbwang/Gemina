  Long-Range Heteronuclear Single Quantum Correlation ( LR-HSQC) experiments may be applied as an alternative to Heteronuclear Multiple-Bond correlation ( HMBC) experiments for detecting long-range correlations , but has never enjoyed popularity for that purpose. To the best of our knowledge , the exact reasons have not yet been fully established. For both experiments it is widely accepted that the evolution of proton-proton homonuclear couplings J
