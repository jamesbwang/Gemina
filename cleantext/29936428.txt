  To determine the incidence and characteristics of hockey ( ` field hockey ') injuries over the course of one outdoor and indoor season. Comparisons of female versus male players , outdoor versus indoor season and match versus practice were performed. Female and male teams of the first , second , third , regional and youth divisions were recruited among a local hockey association in Northern Germany , and followed over an indoor and an outdoor season. Exposure times and location , type , severity and cause of injuries during practice and matches were documented by the coaches or medical staff and collected weekly. Prevalence and incidence rates were calculated. Of the 232 players ( mean ± SD age 20.7 ± 4.7 years , 68.1 % male , 31.9 % first division) , 84 players ( 36.2 %) suffered 108 new injuries during the season. The overall incidence rate was 3.7 injuries per 1000 player hours ( 95 % CI 3.0 to 4.4). The injury incidence was lower in practice ( 2.7 per 1000 player practice hours , 95 % CI 2.0 to 3.3) than in matches ( 9.7 per 1000 player match hours , 95 % CI 6.8 to 12.7) , and was similar for female and male players as well as during the outdoor and the indoor season. Most injuries affected the lower limb ( thigh , knee and ankle) and occurred without contact ( 58.3 %). Severe injuries ( n = 34; 31.5 %) were predominantly located at the knee and hand/finger. Hockey players have a high prevalence and incidence of injuries , especially at the lower limb.
