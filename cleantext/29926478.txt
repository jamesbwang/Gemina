  MEDI0382 is a balanced glucagon-like peptide-1/ glucagon receptor dual agonist under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The primary objective was to assess the safety of MEDI0382 in healthy subjects. In this placebo-controlled , double-blind , phase 1 study , healthy subjects ( aged 18-45 years) were randomised ( 3:1) to receive a single subcutaneous dose of MEDI0382 or placebo after ≥ 8 hours of fasting. The study consisted of six cohorts that received study drug at 5 μg , 10 μg , 30 μg , 100 μg , 150 μg , or 300 μg. The primary objective was safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included assessments of pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. All subjects were followed for up to 28 days. A total of 36 subjects received MEDI0382 ( n = 6 per cohort) and 12 subjects received placebo ( n = 2 per cohort). Treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) occurred more frequently with MEDI0382 vs placebo , which was mostly due to an increased occurrence at MEDI0382 doses ≥ 150 μg. All TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. The most common TEAEs were vomiting , nausea<symptom> , and dizziness<symptom>. There appeared to be a dose-dependent increase in heart rate with MEDI0382 treatment. MEDI0382 showed linear pharmacokinetic profile ( time to maximum plasma concentration: 4.50-9.00 hours; elimination half-life: 9.54-12.07 hours). No immunogenicity was observed in the study. In this single-dose , phase 1 study in healthy subjects , the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of MEDI0382 support once-daily dosing and further clinical development of MEDI0382.
