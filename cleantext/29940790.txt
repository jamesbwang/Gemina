  Immunosuppressant medications are essential for long-term survival following transplantation but increase the risk of developing skin cancer. Prevention and early detection of skin cancer requires screening and sun protection behaviors that can be achieved with patient education. Our method for educating post heart transplant patients regarding skin cancer was inconsistent and was not effective. The aim of this project was to develop and integrate a multimodal skin cancer education program to increase knowledge and protective behaviors for heart transplant recipients. Twenty-five post heart transplant patients who were scheduled to be seen for routine posttransplant care at a single-center transplant center between October 26 , 2016 , and November 15 , 2016 , took part in a multimodal skin cancer education program. There was a significant increase in knowledge between pretest and posttest 1 ( P < .01) and pretest and posttest 2 ( P < .01). A significant increase in sun protective behavior was noted. The project noted that knowledge and behavior was retained , knowledge score posttest 1 to posttest 2 ( P = .085) , all had seen a dermatologist or had an appointment scheduled , and self skin exam retention was noted between posttest 1 and posttest 2 ( P = .25). Process Addressed: The feasibility of and findings from this intervention have led the clinic team to implement this protocol as part of the standard care for all patients. These data suggests that a multimodal intensive skin cancer education program may be effective at increasing knowledge and protective behavior with heart transplant recipients.
