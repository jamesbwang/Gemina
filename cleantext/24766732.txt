  In this study , we conducted an indirect comparison analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors with those of antiangiogenic therapy-two effective treatment methods for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). Eligible randomised control trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors , antiangiogenic therapy , and doublet platinum-based therapy published up to July 2017 were comprehensively analysed. Through the indirect comparison analysis of 37 trials involving 16810 patients , treatments were compared for overall survival ( OS) and grade 3-5 adverse events. For first-line treatment , the use of pembrolizumab alone ( hazard ratio ( HR): 0.6; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.4-0.91) and a combination of bevacizumab and doublet platinum-based therapy ( HR: 0.86; 95 % CI: 0.75-0.99) demonstrated substantial survival benefits compared with doublet platinum-based therapy. For subsequent treatment , nivolumab may provide higher efficacy and lower toxicity than antiangiogenic therapy. Overall , anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies may be superior to antiangiogenic therapy in terms of OS and grade 3-5 adverse events. This meta-analysis suggests that pembrolizumab and nivolumab might be favourable choices for first-line and subsequent treatment , respectively , for patients with advanced NSCLC. Additional randomised control trials are required for a comprehensive evaluation of the outcomes among regimens.
