  Low concentration acetone gas detection is significantly important for diabetes diagnosis as 1.8 ‚Åª 10 ppm of acetone exists in exhaled breath from diabetes patients. A new interlocking p + n field-effect transistor ( FET) circuit has been proposed for Mn-doped ZnO nanoparticles ( MZO) to detect the acetone gas at low concentration , especially close to 1.8 ppm. It is noteworthy that MZO in this interlocking amplification circuit shows a low voltage signal of < 0.3 V to the acetone < 2 ppm while it displays a transilient response with voltage signal > 4.0 V to > 2 ppm acetone. In other words , the response to acetone from 1 ppm to 2 ppm increases by ~ 1233 % , which is competent to separate diabetic patients from healthy people. Moreover , the response to 2 ppm acetone is hardly influenced by high relative humidity of 85 %. In the meanwhile , MZO in this interlocking circuit possesses a high acetone selectivity compared to formaldehyde , acetaldehyde , toluene and ethanol , suggesting a promising technology for the widespread qualitative screening of diabetes. Importantly , this interlocking circuit is also applicable to other types of metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors. The resistance jump of p- and n-FETs induced by the change of their gate voltages is deemed to make this interlocking circuit produce the transilient response.
