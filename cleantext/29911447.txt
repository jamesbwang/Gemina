  Niraparib , an orally available selective inhibitor of poly ( adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase ( PARP) , is the first PARP inhibitor approved for use in patients with ovarian cancer who do not harbor a germ-line or somatic mutation in the breast cancer gene ( BRCA). Overall , niraparib is well tolerated and its toxicities , primarily hematologic , are manageable especially with recently released initial dose modification guidelines based on weight and baseline platelet count. The role of niraparib as maintenance following frontline platinum-based chemotherapy as well as in the treatment of recurrent high-grade serous ovarian cancer is an active area of investigation. Areas covered: This review focuses on niraparib , its pharmacology , clinical efficacy , and adverse effects as evidenced by prospective clinical trials , and licensed indications. Expert commentary: Niraparib introduced the use of PARP inhibitors regardless of biomarker status. Recent studies highlight the critical need for more accurate biomarkers to identify patients most likely to benefit from treatment with PARP inhibitors. In the next 5 years , we anticipate further expansion of and elucidation regarding the optimal indication for use of niraparib in the treatment of ovarian cancer.
