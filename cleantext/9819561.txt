  Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 ( OCT4) is a transcription factor with a well-defined role in stem cell pluripotency. Two OCT4 isoforms , OCT4A and OCT4B , tend to be downregulated as normal cells differentiate. However , OCT4 , particularly OCT4B , may become reactivated in cancer cells. Despite this observation , the exact function of OCT4B re-expression in cancer is unclear. In the present study , the role of OCT4 in breast cancer cells was determined. In particular , the ability of OCT4 to regulate key genes involved in cellular proliferation and apoptosis , two pathways that are frequently deregulated in cancer , was examined. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A locus encodes p16INK4a and p14ARF , two important cell cycle inhibitors. The tumor suppressor p53 also has well characterized roles in suppressing proliferation and promoting apoptosis. The present study demonstrated , via overexpression and genetic knockdown techniques , that OCT4B regulates the expression of several of these genes and ultimately regulates the rate of apoptosis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. It was also observed that , while OCT4B and OCT4A regulate one another , it is OCT4B that serves a more prominent role in regulating the transcription of downstream genes. Taken together , the present results suggest that OCT4B is re-expressed in a number of breast cancer cell lines , where it affects both the transcription of cell cycle genes and the rate of apoptosis. These properties of OCT4B may depend on , at least in part , the co-function of OCT4A.
