  Mitochondrial dynamics are tightly controlled by fusion and fission , and their dysregulation and excess reactive oxygen species ( ROS) contribute to endothelial cell ( EC) dysfunction. How redox signals regulate coupling between mitochondrial dynamics and endothelial ( dys) function remains unknown. Here , we identify protein disulfide isomerase A1 ( PDIA1) as a thiol reductase for the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1. A biotin-labeled Cys-OH trapping probe and rescue experiments reveal that PDIA1 depletion in ECs induces sulfenylation of Drp1 at Cys
