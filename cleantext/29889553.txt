  While mutation rates can vary markedly over the residues of a protein , multiple sequence alignment tools typically use the same values for their scoring-function parameters across a protein 's entire length. We present a new approach , called adaptive local realignment , that in contrast automatically adapts to the diversity of mutation rates along protein sequences. This builds upon a recent technique known as parameter advising , which finds global parameter settings for an aligner , to now adaptively find local settings. Our approach in essence identifies local regions with low estimated accuracy , constructs a set of candidate realignments using a carefully-chosen collection of parameter settings , and replaces the region if a realignment has higher estimated accuracy. This new method of local parameter advising , when combined with prior methods for global advising , boosts alignment accuracy as much as 26 % over the best default setting on hard-to-align protein benchmarks , and by 6.4 % over global advising alone. Adaptive local realignment has been implemented within the Opal aligner using the Facet accuracy estimator.
