  Due to a higher environmental stability than few-layer black phosphorus and a higher carrier mobility than few-layer dichalcogenides , two-dimensional ( 2D) semiconductor InSe has become quite a promising channel material for the next-generation field-effect transistors ( FETs). Here , we provide the investigation of the many-body effect and transistor performance scaling of monolayer ( ML) InSe based on ab initio GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation approaches and quantum transport simulations , respectively. The fundamental band gap of ML InSe is indirect and 2.60 eV. The optical band gap of ML InSe is 2.50 eV for the in-plane polarized light , with the corresponding exciton binding energy of 0.58 eV. The ML InSe metal oxide semiconductor FETs ( MOSFETs) show excellent performances with reduced short-channel effects. The on-current , delay time , and dynamic power indicator of the optimized n- and p-type ML InSe MOSFETs can satisfy the high-performance and low-power requirements of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors 2013 both down to 3-5 nm gate length in the ballistic limit. Therefore , a new avenue is opened to continue Moore 's law down to 3 nm by utilizing 2D InSe.
