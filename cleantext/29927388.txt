  The interactions between phosphines and boranes in crystal structures have been investigated by analyzing data from the Cambridge Structural Database ( CSD). The interactions between phosphines and boranes were classified into three types; two types depend on groups on the boron atom , whereas the third one involves frustrated Lewis pairs ( FLPs). The data enabled geometric parameters in structures to be compared with phosphine-borane FLPs with classical Lewis pairs. Most of the crystal structures ( 78.1 %) contain BH
