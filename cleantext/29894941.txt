  Interfacial self-assembly has been demonstrated as a powerful driving mechanism for creating various nanostructured assemblies. In this work , we employed a dual-droplet printing process and interfacial self-assembly mechanism to produce deposits with controlled assembly structures of colloidal nanoparticles. We hypothesize that pH modulation of the droplet will influence the interfacial self-assembly through the multibody interactions , e.g. particle-particle , particle-interface , and particle-substrate interactions , correspondingly affecting the deposition morphology of the colloidal nanoparticles. During the dual-droplet printing , a wetting droplet , containing colloidal nanoparticles , was jetted over a supporting droplet that contains water only. pH modulation was carried out to the supporting droplet. The self-assembly of two kinds of functionalized polystyrene ( PS) nanoparticles ( carboxyl-PS and sulfate-PS) was systematically investigated under various pH conditions. Depending on the pH level of the supporting droplet , deposits of carboxyl-PS particles ranging from clear ring-like patterns to nearly uniform monolayer depositions have been obtained. On the other hand , the sulfate-PS particles , even at extreme basic and acidic environments , successfully assemble into nearly monolayer depositions. The multibody interactions are discussed. Such findings can be harnessed in manufacturing high-performance optical and electronic devices.
