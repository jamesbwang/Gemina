  Lanthanide ( III) ions bind to the glycocalyx of Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO) cells and give rise to a unique luminescent fingerprint. Following direct excitation of terbium ( III) and europium ( III) ions in the visible part of the spectrum , we are able to collect emission spectra pixel-by-pixel in images of CHO cells. Following data analysis that removes the background signal , the fine structure of the europium ( III) luminescence indicate that the lanthanide ( III) ions are bound to a single structure of the CHO cell glycocalyx. This was deduced from the fact that the structure-sensitive emission spectrum of europium is unchanged throughout the investigated samples.
