  Central sleep apnoea ( CSA) occurs in a large proportion of HF patients. CSA has clear detrimental effects , resulting in intermittent hypoxia and sympathetic activation , and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment options are limited following the results of a recent trial in which adaptive servo-ventilation resulted in an increase in cardiovascular mortality. Ongoing studies utilising other forms of positive airway pressure may provide additional insight into the results of this trial. A new neurostimulation therapy , phrenic nerve stimulation , has offered a new physiological approach to the treatment of CSA. This therapy has resulted in improvements in the severity of disease and quality of life.
