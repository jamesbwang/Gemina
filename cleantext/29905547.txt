  Soft tissue fillers are used in aesthetic medicine for volumizing and for contouring. Calcium hydroxylapatite ( CaHA) is a fully biodegradable biostimulatory filler. The study presents results of in vitro biocompatibility and cytotoxicity investigations performed on CaHA and illustrates its clinical effects. We used a human cell culture model for in vitro studies with HaCaT keratinocytes and human dermal fibroblasts , known to be a sensitive cell type for biocompatibility and cytotoxicity. Cells were exposed to different concentrations of CaHA ( Radiesse Â®). Cell proliferation was calculated by luminometric adenosine triphosphate ( ATP) measurement using the ATPLiteTM-M Assay. Possible cytotoxic effects were detected by the calorimetric Cytotoxicity Detection Kit. Clinical data were obtained from our own treatment files. CaHA did neither inhibit cell proliferation nor cause cytotoxicity. Clinical data suggest an excellent tolerability and long-term efficacy superior to hyaluronic acid-based fillers. CaHA is a versatile and well-tolerated biodegradable and biostimulatory filler.
