  This study aims to determine the normal limits of atlanto-dental interval ( ADI) , basion-dens interval ( BDI) , basion-cartilaginous dens interval ( BCDI) , and prevertebral soft tissue thickness ( PVSTT) according to age groups for normal pediatric cases. CT images of 256 pediatric patients aged between 1 and 15 years were retrospectively evaluated. ADI , BDI , BCDI and PVSTT measurements were performed. Upper<symptom> normal limit ( UNL) values for ADI were 2.65-4.8 mm. UNL values for PVSTT were found to be 6.9 mm at C1 level , 6.7 mm at C2 level , 9.3 mm at C3 level , 14.2 mm at C4 level , 14.1 mm at C5 level , 13.8 mm at C6 level and 12.8 mm at C7 level. The maximum value of BDI in the group with non-ossified os terminale was 12 mm , and in the group with ossified os terminale it was 10 mm. The UNL of BCDI determined for females was 5.1 mm , while the UNL for males was 5.6 mm. We propose the obtained values as the UNL values for ADI , BDI , BCDI and PVSTT on CT images in the pediatric population from 1 to 15 years.
