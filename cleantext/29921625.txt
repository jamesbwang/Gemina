  The Big Blue ® λSelect-cII selection system has been employed along with whole-exome sequencing , to examine the susceptibility of the male germ line to mutation in two challenging situations: ( i) exposure to a chemotherapeutic regime including bleomycin , etoposide and cis-platinum ( BEP) and ( ii) the ageing process. A 3-week exposure to BEP induced complete azoospermia associated with a loss of developing germ cells and extensive vacuolization of Sertoli cell cytoplasm. Following cessation of treatment , spermatozoa first appeared in the caput epididymis after 6 weeks and by 12 weeks motile spermatozoa could be recovered from the cauda , although the count ( P < 0.001) and motility ( P < 0.01) of these cells was significantly reduced and superoxide generation was significantly elevated ( P < 0.001). Despite this increase in free radical generation , no evidence of chromatin instability was detected in these spermatozoa. Furthermore , embryos obtained from females mated at this 12-week time point showed no evidence of an increased mutational load. Similarly progressive ageing of Big Blue ® mice had no impact on the quality of the spermatozoa , fertility or mutation frequency in the offspring despite a significant increase in the mutational load carried by somatic tissues such as the liver ( P < 0.05). We conclude that the male germ line is highly resistant to mutation in keeping with the disposable soma hypothesis , which posits that genetic integrity in the germ cells will be maintained at the expense of the soma , in light of the former 's sentinel position in safeguarding the stability of the genome.
