  One of the challenges in breast reduction is to maintain breast projection with 45 % of its volume in the upper pole and 55 % in the lower pole. Although widely used in breast surgeries , the behavior of fat grafts is still not completely understood. To evaluate by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) the survival of fat transferred to the retropectoral plane in patients undergoing breast reduction , in the search for an oncologically safe procedure with high predictability and reproducibility. This pilot study was conducted with 7 patients who underwent breast reduction combined with fat grafting in the submuscular plane. Aspirated fat was processed by sedimentation. MRI of the breasts<disease> was performed preoperatively and at 1 and 6 months postoperatively. Fat survival was calculated as the difference between the volumes of fat measured preoperatively and postoperatively by MRI divided by the volume of grafted fat. Fourteen breasts<disease> were operated on and received on average 119.6 ml of autologous fat in the submuscular plane. Fat survival rate was 43.9 % at 1 month after surgery , decreasing to 23.4 % in the late postoperative period. The mean anteroposterior projection of the grafted tissue was 1.51 cm at 1 month postoperatively , decreasing to 1.07 cm in the late postoperative period. Retropectoral fat grafting may contribute to maintaining the fullness of the upper pole of the breasts<disease>. This is an innovative experimental model for future studies on fat harvesting , preparation and grafting techniques , allowing the evaluation of fat graft survival.
