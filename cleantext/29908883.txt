  The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of the Corvis ST ( Oculus; Wetzlar , Germany) biomechanical correction algorithm ( bIOP) in determining intraocular pressure ( IOP) using experiments on ex-vivo human eyes. Five ex-vivo human ocular globes ( age 69 Â± 3 years) were obtained and tested within 3-5 days post mortem. Using a custom-built inflation rig , the internal pressure of the eyes was controlled mechanically and measured using the CorVis ST ( CVS-IOP). The CVS-IOP measurements were then corrected to produce bIOP , which was developed for being less affected by variations in corneal biomechanical parameters , including tissue thickness and material properties. True IOP ( IOPt) was defined as the pressure inside of the globe as monitored using a fixed pressure transducer. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the accuracy of both CVS-IOP and bIOP , and their correlation with corneal thickness. While no significant differences were found between bIOP and IOP
