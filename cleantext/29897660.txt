  ortho-Methyl effects are exploited to tune steric hindrance between side-chain N , N '- diaryls and polycyclic dihydrodibenzo ( a , c) phenazine , and in turn control the conformations of N , N '- diphenyl-dihydrodibenzo ( a , c) phenazine ( DPAC) and its ortho-methyl derivatives Mx-My ( x = 0 , 1 or 2 , y = 1 or 2 , x and y correlate with the number of methyl groups in the ortho-positiond of N , N '- diphenyl). The magnitude of steric hindrance increases as x and y increase , and the V-shaped dihydrodibenzo ( a , c) phenazine skeleton is gradually tuned from a bent ( DPAC) to planar ( M2-M2) structure in the ground state. As a result , the relaxation of the excited-state structure of DPAC and its numerous analogues could be mimicked by model structures Mx-My , demonstrating for the first time the the conformation change from bent-to-planar and hence a large range of energy-gap tuning of polycyclic conjugated structures controlled by the steric hindrance.
