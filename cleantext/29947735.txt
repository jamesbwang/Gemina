  If two plant species share pollinators , it has been proposed that the interaction between them may range from competitive to facilitative , depending on the way in which they intermingle. In particular , the presence of a rewarding plant species may increase the rate of pollinator visitation to a less rewarding species in its vicinity , but the beneficial increase in visitation may be counteracted by a detrimental increase in heterospecific pollen transfer. We assessed this trade-off using bumble-bees foraging over a gradual spatial transition between two plant species in an indoor cage experiment. We used two ` species ' of artificial flowers- one more rewarding than the other- in arrays that varied in the degree of species intermingling. The flowers dispensed and received powdered food dyes serving as pollen analogues. Captive bumble-bees visited to collect sucrose solution. We quantified dye delivery to the adhesive-tape ` stigmas ' in flowers by spectrophotometry. Across the spatial transition between species , the less attractive species received more dye ( more bee visits) when in proximity to the more attractive species than it did when alone , but the larger dye loads were less pure ( more heterospecific pollen transfer). The decline in purity cancelled out the gain in acquisition , so conspecific pollen receipt by the less attractive species was neutrally affected. The more attractive species received fewer visits when surrounded by the less attractive species , so the interaction between the two species was amensalism when considering conspecific pollen reception. Pollinator-mediated interactions between plant species depend on pollination quantity and purity , both of which can depend on spatial intermingling.
