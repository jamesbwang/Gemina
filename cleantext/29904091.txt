  Although naloxone has been documented to exert neuroprotection in animal model of cerebral ischemia , the mechanism is not well understood. In this present study we investigated whether naloxone affected the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in ischemic brain injury of rats. SD rats were subjected to a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery , and received naloxone ( 0.5 , 1 , 2 mg/kg , i.v.) immediately after ischemia. Neurological deficits were evaluated 24 h after ischemia using the McGraw Stroke Index , and then the rats were killed , and the brains were collected for further analyses. We show that naloxone treatment dose-dependently decreased the infarction volume and morphological injury , improved motor behavioral function , and markedly curtailed brain edema<symptom>. Furthermore , naloxone administration significantly inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and decreased the levels of nuclear NF-κB p65 in the ischemic penumbra. Naloxone administration also dose-dependently increased the NF-κB inhibitory protein ( IκBα) levels and attenuated phosphorylated NIK and IKKα levels in the ischemic penumbra. In addition , naloxone administration dose-dependently increased Bcl-2 levels , decreased Bax levels , stabilized the mitochondrial transmembrane potential , and inhibited cytochrome c release and caspase 3 and caspase 9 activation. These results indicate that the neuroprotective effects of naloxone against ischemic brain injury involve the inhibition of NF-κB activation via the suppression of the NIK/IKKα/IκBα pathway and the obstruction of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in neurons.
