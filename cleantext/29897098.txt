  To investigate the prevalence of frailty using a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment ( CGA) in older community-dwelling adults living in rural northern Tanzania. Cross-sectional survey. Five randomly selected villages in Hai District , Kilimanjaro region , Tanzania. All adults aged 60 and older living in the selected villages were eligible to participate , including older adults with cognitive impairment provided a close relative was able to assent on their behalf. All participants were community dwelling because institutionalization is very rare. Participants were screened using a short frailty screening tool , the Brief Frailty Instrument for Tanzania ( B-FIT) , comprising an abbreviated test of cognitive function and the Barthel Index , which assesses functional independence. Based on B-FIT score , a frailty-weighted , stratified sample was selected for in-depth assessment using CGA and characterized as frail or not frail. Two hundred thirty-six CGAs were performed in 1,207 people screened , 91 of whom were deemed frail. After adjusting for stratification , the prevalence of frailty was 19.1 % ( 95 % confidence interval = 15.2-23.1). This is the first study in sub-Saharan Africa to report the prevalence of frailty in community-dwelling older adults according to a CGA. The strengths of reporting frailty according to a CGA include the ability to consider likely medical diagnoses based on clinical assessment and to assess individuals ' social circumstances and environment.
