  Problem-based learning ( PBL) is an effective and highly efficient teaching approach that is extensively applied in education systems across a variety of countries. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of web-based PBL teaching pedagogies in large classes. The cluster sampling method was used to separate two college-level nursing student classes ( graduating class of 2013) into two groups. The experimental group ( n = 162) was taught using a web-based PBL teaching approach , while the control group ( n = 166) was taught using conventional teaching methods. We subsequently assessed the satisfaction of the experimental group in relation to the web-based PBL teaching mode. This assessment was performed following comparison of teaching activity outcomes pertaining to exams and self-learning capacity between the two groups. When compared with the control group , the examination scores and self-learning capabilities were significantly higher in the experimental group ( P < 0.01) compared with the control group. In addition , 92.6 % of students in the experimental group expressed satisfaction with the new web-based PBL teaching approach. In a large class-size teaching environment , the web-based PBL teaching approach appears to be more optimal than traditional teaching methods. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of web-based teaching technologies in problem-based learning.
