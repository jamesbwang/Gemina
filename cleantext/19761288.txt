  The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to assess the impact of malocclusion on the quality of life of children aged 8 to 10 years attending public elementary schools in Belo Horizonte , State of Minas Gerais , Brazil. The Brazilian version of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire 8-10 ( CPQ8-10) was used to evaluate oral health-related quality of life. The children were examined for the diagnosis of malocclusion using the Dental Aesthetic Index ( DAI). The data were analyzed by bivariate and multivariate descriptive statistics using Poisson regression at a 5 % significance level. A total of 270 children participated in the study. Children with normal occlusion or mild malocclusion ( DAI ≤ 25) were 56 % less likely ( 95 % CI: 0.258-0.758; p = 0.003) to have their quality of life affected compared with children diagnosed with extremely severe malocclusion ( DAI ≥ 36). Children with a maxillary anterior overjet ≥ 3 mm had higher CPQ8-10 mean scores ( 19.4; SD = 17.1) than those with an overjet < 3 mm ( 13.6; SD = 11.7; p = 0.038). Extremely severe malocclusion and pronounced maxillary anterior overjet were associated with a negative impact on quality of life.
