  Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma ( MANEC) are rare cancers of the gastrointestinal ( GI) and pancreatobiliary tract. They are characterized by the presence of a combination of epithelial and neuroendocrine elements , where each component represents at least 30 % of the tumour. Review of literature and consolidation of clinicopathological data. Sixty-one cases of colorectal MANEC have been reported in literature and one seen in this centre. The median age of the patients affected was 61.9 ± 12.4 years ( 20-94 years). Male to female ratio is 1.0:1.2. Presentations were similar to other colorectal malignancies. 58.0 % of colorectal MANECs were found in the right colon , 8.1 % cases in the transverse , 16.1 % in the left colon , 16.1 % in the rectum. These tumours appeared invasiveness 79.1 % were T3-T4. Over 90 % of cases were presented with metastatic disease. The majority of patient underwent surgical resection of the primary cancer ( 96.6 %). Of these , 10 operations ( 17.9 %) were emergency operations due to obstruction , perforation , or bleeding. Three patients received first line palliative care. In eight cases ( 13.8 %) , patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. The median overall survival after diagnosis was 10 ± 2.4 months ( 95 % CI: 5.37-14.64 months). MANECs are rare but aggressive colorectal cancers. Surgical resection of localized disease with adjuvant chemotherapy appears to significantly improve survival in small case series. Further understanding through the sharing of experiences is required.
