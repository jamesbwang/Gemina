  This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of administering liver reirradiation to patients with primary liver tumors or liver metastasis. A total of 49 patients ( with 64 individual tumors) who received liver reirradiation at our institution between June 2008 and December 2016 were identified for retrospective review. Patients were treated to the same , different , or a combination of previously treated liver tumors for recurrent primary ( 53 %) or metastatic ( 47 %) disease using photons or protons. Clinical and treatment-related factors were compiled and patients were monitored for toxicity and evidence of classic or nonclassic radiation-induced liver disease. Survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and cumulative incidence of local failure ( LF) was used to estimate LF using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. The median age at the time of reirradiation was 72 years and the median interval between radiation courses was 9 months. At a median follow-up of 10.5 months , 36 patients ( 73 %) had died , 9 patients ( 18 %) were alive , and 4 patients ( 8 %) were lost to follow-up. The median survival for the cohort was 14 months. The overall 1-year estimate of LF was 46.4 %. The 1-year estimates of LF for liver metastases and hepatocellular carcinoma were 61.0 % and 32.5 % , respectively. The average prescription dose was similar between the reirradiation and initial courses ( equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions EQD2: 65.0 vs 64.3 Gy Liver reirradiation may be an effective and safe option for select patients; however , further prospective study is necessary to establish treatment guidelines and recommended dosing.
