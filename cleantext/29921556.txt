  There is evidence for beneficial effects of lipoprotein apheresis ( LA) in terms of reduction of cardiovascular events and interventions , but quality of life ( QOL) in LA patients has only been explored in small samples. In this study , both LA- or treatment-related and health-related QOL ( HRQOL) were assessed in 206 LA patients. Mental and physical HRQOL of the LA patients was assessed by means of the SF-12 as well as the EQ-5D. Physical complaints were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 and LA- or treatment-related QOL by the Apheresis Quality of Life Form , developed for this study. Comparison with general population norms showed that LA patients scored significantly lower on HRQOL and significantly higher on physical complaints. A higher perceived impact of the treatment proved to have a significant negative association with HRQOL and a positive one with physical complaints. Previous studies reported higher levels of QOL in LA patients. This study showed that treatment-related QOL contributes to HRQOL and physical complaints in LA patients. While many patients do not experience LA as a real burden and report positive effects of the treatment , there is also an important group of patients for whom this is not the case. Although the impact on QOL of LA patients does most probably not outweigh the cardiovascular benefits of the treatment , it is important to screen treatment-related QOL in LA patients to optimize care in a personalized way. Future research is needed to compare QOL in LA with non-LA patients with similar medical conditions.
