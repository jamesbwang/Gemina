  We carried out tests of the first 2 premises of the Continuum Model ( CM) of impression formation ( Fiske & Neuberg , 1990). These premises predict that category information will in general be more influential than noncategory information , and that the fit of noncategorical attributes with the category is a major determinant of the relative influence of these types of information. Using stimuli that included sets of ( a) text items only , and ( b) combinations of photos and text items , we found no support for these claims , even using alternative tests. In addition , many positive effects found in our analyses run counter to the predictions of the CM. We conclude that either significant portions of dual-process models ( also , Brewer , 1988) are not applicable to many previously claimed scenarios of impression formation , or that although pieces of them may be roughly accurate , reasonable questions arise as to their predictive and discriminant validity.
