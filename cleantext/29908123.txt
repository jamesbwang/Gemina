  Plasma oncology is a relatively new field of research. Recent developments have indicated that cold atmospheric plasma ( CAP) technology is an interesting new therapeutic approach to cancer treatment. In this study , p53 wildtype ( LoVo) and human p53 mutated ( HT29 and SW480) colorectal cancer cells were treated with the miniFlatPlaSter- a device particularly developed for the treatment of tumor cells- that uses the Surface Micro Discharge ( SMD) technology for plasma production in air. The present study analyzed the effects of plasma on colorectal cancer cells in vitro and on normal colon tissue ex vivo. Plasma treatment had strong effects on colon cancer cells , such as inhibition of cell proliferation , induction of cell death and modulation of p21 expression. In contrast , CAP treatment of murine colon tissue ex vivo for up to 2 min did not show any toxic effect on normal colon cells compared to H2O2 positive control. In summary , these results suggest that the miniFlatPlaSter plasma device is able to kill colorectal cancer cells independent of their p53 mutation status. Thus , this device presents a promising new approach in colon cancer therapy.
