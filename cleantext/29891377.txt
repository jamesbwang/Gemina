  Fungal metabolomics is a field of high potential but yet largely unexploited. Focusing on plant-pathogenic fungi<pathogen> , no metabolomics studies exist on their resistance to fungicides , which represents a major issue that the agrochemical and agricultural sectors are facing. Fungal infections cause quantitative , but also qualitative yield losses , especially in the case of mycotoxin-producing species. The aim of the study was to correlate metabolic changes in Fusarium<pathogen> graminearum strains ' metabolomes with their carbendazim-resistant level and discover corresponding metabolites-biomarkers , with primary focus on its primary metabolism. For this purpose , comparative
