  Four out of five Black women in the US , over the age of 20 years meet criteria for obesity. A critical determinant of pervasive health disparities , such as obesity , may be the Black woman 's sociocultural experience. One part of this experience is the stress that results from daily encounters with microaggressions. Research has been limited on the association of race-related stress with maladaptive health behaviors among Black women and at what age this association is visible. The aim of this exploratory cross-sectional study was to investigate whether perceived race-related stress was associated with an obesity risk behavior , emotional eating. One hundred and forty-nine collegiate Black American women from across the US completed an anonymous online survey during the summer of 2014. Race-related stress was moderately correlated with emotional eating ( r = 0.32 , p < 0.001). However , a hierarchical linear regression revealed that the relationship between race-related stress and emotional eating remained significant after controlling for weight range and general perceived stress. Race-related stress contributed an additional 3.9 % of the explained variance for emotional eating. Interventions for weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and management targeting young adult Black women must acknowledge how their perceived racial experience is linked to health behaviors and outcomes.
