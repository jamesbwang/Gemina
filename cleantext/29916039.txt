  Mercury contamination in consumed foods poses a significant threat to human health globally. The consumption of mercury-contaminated turtle meat is of special concern due to mercury 's capability to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in organisms. Turtles are long-lived predators , allowing for a high degree of bioaccumulation and biomagnification of contaminants. In the U.S. , diamondback terrapins ( Malaclemys terrapin) are legally harvested in several states throughout their range. Harvested turtles are usually sold to both local and global markets mainly for human consumption , which results in a human consumption threat. The objective of this study was to analyze mercury concentrations to determine if the consumption of terrapins poses a threat to human health. Diamondback terrapins were collected from two study sites: Cape May and Hackensack Meadowlands , New Jersey , relatively pristine and contaminated estuaries , respectively. Turtle carapace , blood , and muscle samples were analyzed for total mercury concentrations. Results showed significant difference between study sites and females ' and males ' blood mercury concentrations. Similarly , results showed blood mercury correlated with carapace length. Results also showed that 50 % of Cape May muscle samples and 72.7 % Meadowlands muscles samples surpassed the New Jersey sensitive threshold of 0.18 ppm. Furthermore , 27.3 % of Cape May muscle samples and 45.5 % of Meadowlands muscles samples surpassed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's mercury threshold of 0.3 ppm for seafood consumption for the general public. Overall , the harvest of terrapins could pose a threat to consumers , and terrapins should be monitored closely or possibly banned for human consumption , especially in areas with known contamination history.
