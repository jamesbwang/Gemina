  The radial forearm free flap phalloplasty provides a thin , potentially sensate , minimally hair-bearing cutaneous flap. Since its initial description , several modifications of the technique have emerged. The earliest dimensions described needed to be increased because of the increase amount of subcutaneous fat in the Western population. Incorporating a centrally placed neo-urethra with a distal extension that gets folded over to create a semblance of a neoglans eliminates the distal/meatal stenosis. Performing a urethral extension at a preliminary surgery and extending the neourethra proximally has improved the position of the neophallus and minimized proximal urethral strictures and fistulas<disease> in transgender men.
