  Guidelines on the required number of ambulatory blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( ABP) readings focus on individual patients. Clinical researchers often face the dilemma of applying recommendations and discarding potentially valuable information or accepting fewer readings. Starting from ABP recordings with ≥ 30/ ≥ 10 awake/asleep readings in 4277 participants enrolled in eight population studies in the International Database on Ambulatory Blood<symptom> Pressure<symptom> in Relation to Cardiovascular Outcomes ( IDACO) , we randomly selected a certain number of readings ( from 30 to 1 awake and 10 to 1 asleep readings) at a time over 1000 bootstraps at each step. We evaluated: ( i) concordance of the ABP level; ( ii) consistency of the cross-classification based on office blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and ABP; and ( iii) accuracy in predicting cardiovascular complications. For each criterion , we fitted a regression line joining data points relating outcome to the number of readings covering the ranges of 30-20/10- 7 for awake/asleep readings. Reducing readings widened the SD of the systolic/diastolic differences between full ( reference) and selected recordings from 1.7/ 1.2 ( 30 readings) to 14.3/ 10.3 mm Hg ( single reading) during wakefulness , and from 1.9/ 1.4 to 10.3/ 7.7 mm Hg during sleep; lowered the κ statistic from 0.94 to 0.63 , and decreased the hazard ratio associated with 10/5 mm Hg increments in systolic/diastolic ABP from 1.21/ 1.14 to 1.06/ 1.04 during wakefulness and from 1.26/ 1.17 to 1.14/ 1.08 during sleep. The first data points falling off these regression lines during wakefulness/sleep corresponded to 8/3 and 8/4 readings for criteria ( i) and ( iii) and to 5 awake readings for criterion ( ii). 24-h ambulatory recordings with ≥ 8/ ≥ 4 awake/asleep readings yielded ABP levels similar to recordings including the guideline-recommended ≥ 20/ ≥ 7 readings. These criteria save valuable data in a research setting , but are not applicable to clinical practice.
