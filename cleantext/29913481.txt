  The etiology of altered blood fatty acid ( FA) profile in phenylketonuria ( PKU) is understood only partially. We aimed to determine whether FAs deficiency is dependent on the diet or metabolic disturbances. The study comprised 40 PKU patients ( 20 female , 20 male; aged 11 to 35 years; 12 children and 28 adults) and 40 healthy subjects ( HS; 20 female , 20 male , aged 18 to 33 years). We assessed the profile of FAs ( gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) and analyzed the 72-hour dietary recalls. The amount of C14: 0 , C16: 0 and C16: 1n-7 , C18: 1n-9 did not differ between the analyzed groups. The percentage of C18: 0 was higher , while C20: 3n-9 , C18: 2n-6 , C20: 2n-6 , C20: 4n-6 , C22: 4n-6 , C22: 5n-6 and C22: 6n-3 was lower in PKU than in HS. However , C18: 3n-6 , C18: 3n-3 and n-6/ n-3 ratio were higher in PKU patients. The C20: 4n-6/ C20: 3n-6 ratio ( reaction catalyzed by Δ5-desaturase) , the C22: 5n-6/ C22: 4n-6 and the C22: 6n-3/ C22: 5n-3 ratio ( both reactions catalyzed by Δ6 desaturase) were significantly lower in PKU patients. Therefore , the deficiency of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in PKU patients may result not only from inadequate supply but also from metabolic disturbances.
