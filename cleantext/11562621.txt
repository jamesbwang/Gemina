  Parents can play a vital role in shaping teenagers ' sexual attitudes , behavior , and contraceptive use through communication , however , less is known about how to modify parent-adolescent communication among youth with mental health problems. The impact of a family-based sexual risk prevention intervention on both observational and self-report of parent adolescent sexual communication was examined at 12-months among adolescents with mental health problems. Of the 721 parent- adolescent dyads recruited for the study , 167 videotapes of sexual discussions between parents and adolescent were coded for the family-based intervention and 191 videotapes for the active comparison. Longitudinal analyses examined differences between conditions ( family-based vs. comparison) in self-reported and observed parent-adolescent sexual discussions and also examined the impact of gender on intervention response. More parent I-statements , healthier parent Body-Language , and fewer adolescent Negative Vocalizations were detected for family-based intervention participants 12 months after participating in the brief intervention ( 11 hours of total intervention time) relative to those in the comparison condition. Parents in the family-based intervention also self-reported better sexual communication at 12-months. The current study provides supporting evidence that a relatively brief family-based intervention was successful at addressing parent-adolescent sexual communication among a mental health sample.
