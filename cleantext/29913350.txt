  Depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> are prevalent in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF). Reduced ejection fraction ( EF) and increased N-terminal-prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP) have been shown to be independently associated with depressive symptoms and may therefore increase HF disease progression and mortality. This study evaluated whether NT-proBNP mediated the impact of reduced EF on depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms in patients with HF. Participants ( n = 124) were patients with a diagnosis of chronic HF enrolled in the Heart<symptom> Failure Disease Management Program at Health Sciences North. Subjects were assessed for depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms according to the Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale questionnaire at enrolment. Ejection fraction , measured through Multigated Acquisition Technique and NT-proBNP , measured through chemiluminescent immunoassay , were obtained at baseline. Patient outcomes were monitored for 12-months after enrollment. Associations were determined using regression and multivariate models. Indirect effects were assessed using mediation analysis. EF and NT-proBNP were highly correlated. Mediation analysis showed no significant direct effect of EF on the levels of depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms , however , there was a significant indirect effect of EF on depression<symptom> that was mediated by the levels of NT-proBNP , but not for EF and anxiety<symptom>. Our results suggest that NT-proBNP is a potential mechanism linking reduced EF and depressive symptoms in patients with HF. While results are still preliminary , this study suggests that NT-proBNP may be a potential biomarker in identifying HF patients with reduced EF at high risk for depression<symptom> , disease progression and mortality.
