  Cinnamomum zeylanicum ( cinnamon) is a plant with potent antioxidant activity and has been used in traditional medicine for improvement of heart function. The effects of cinnamon bark ethanolic extract were investigated against ischemia-induced arrhythmias and heart injury in an in vivo rat model of regional heart ischemia. The extract was also standardized , and its antioxidant activity was evaluated. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 30 min of ischemia by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 5 days of reperfusion. Thirty-two animals were randomized to receive daily oral administration of vehicle or C. zeylanicum bark extract ( intragastric , 50 , 100 , or 200 mg/kg) 14 days before ischemia. C. zeylanicum was standardized through HPLC analysis. Administration of cinnamon bark extract significantly improved ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial injury as evidenced by reduction of the infarct size. Also , during the ischemic period , ventricular tachycardia<symptom> and ventricular ectopic beats episodes decreased as compared with that of the control group. The extract stabilized the ST segment changes and QTc shortening , decreased R-wave amplitude , and increased heart rate during ischemia. The extract also caused significant elevations in serum superoxide dismutase and glutation proxidase activities as well as a significant decrease in serum cardiac troponin I , lactate dehydrogenase , and malondialdehyde levels , 5 days after reperfusion. In HPLC analysis , the amounts of Cinamic acid , Methyl eugenol , and Cinnamaldehyde were 8.99 ± 0.5 , 13.02 ± 1.8 , and 14.63 ± 1.1 mg/g , respectively. The results show that the ethanolic extract of cinnamon bark is able to protect the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury probably due to its antioxidant properties. Hence , it might be beneficial in these patients and this remedy might be used for preparation of new drugs.
