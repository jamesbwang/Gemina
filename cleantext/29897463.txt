  There is an urgent need for accurate and fast diagnostic tests to identify carbapenemase-producing bacteria. Here , we have evaluated three MALDI-TOF-based techniques to detect carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae ( CPE) from cultured colonies. The performance of three MALDI-TOF-based techniques , including the commercialized MBT STAR ®- Carba IVD Kit ( Bruker Daltonics) and two in-house protocols performed on the Microflex LT Biotyper ( Bruker Daltonics) and the VITEK ® MS Plus ( bioMérieux) , were compared with those of the RAPIDEC ® CARBA NP ( bioMérieux). A collection of 175 isolates including 120 carbapenemase producers and 55 non-carbapenemase producers was tested. Samples were tested blind in the three participating centres. The repeatability of the MBT STAR ®- Carba IVD Kit was also evaluated. The three MALDI-TOF techniques possess sensitivities ranging from 95 % to 100 % and specificities from 98.2 % to 100 % compared with 99.2 % and 100 % , respectively , for the RAPIDEC ® CARBA NP. The MBT STAR ®- Carba IVD Kit gave highly reproducible results and is the only technique able to provide a concomitant identification of the bacterial isolate. The three MALDI-TOF techniques possess a fast turnaround time ( less than 1.5 h). Overall , MALDI-TOF is a reliable technique for the rapid detection of CPE from cultured colonies. MBT STAR ®- Carba IVD Kit , the only commercially available assay , could easily be implemented in a clinical microbiology laboratory if it is already equipped with a Microflex LT Biotyper mass spectrometer.
