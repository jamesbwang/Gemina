  Objectives The aim of this study was to explore how the handling of nerves affects the risk for developing sensory<symptom> disturbances<symptom> ( SDs) following groin hernia surgery. Patients and methods All patients 18 years or older undergoing surgery for inguinal hernia at Mora Hospital , Sweden , during an eight-month period in 2006 , were eligible for inclusion. The surgical procedure was recorded prospectively according to a standardised protocol. One year postoperatively all patients were requested to answer the Inguinal Pain Questionnaire as well as a set of 18 sensory and affective pain descriptors. They were also invited to clinical examination including sensory testing. Results Of the 157 hernia repairs in Mora during the period of study , 128 repairs in 116 patients , were registered prospectively according to the study protocol. Laparoscopic total extraperitoneal ( TEP) repair was performed in 36 ( 28 %) of the patients. Ninety-two ( 79 %) patients , including five patients operated bilaterally , underwent postoperative examination. SDs were found in 33 ( 34 %) of the groins examined. No descriptor was found that significantly predicted the presence of altered examination findings. No significant association between the intraoperative handling of nerves and SD was seen. In the TEP-group , no SDs were seen. Infiltration of local anaesthetic agents and blockade of the ilioinguinal nerve prior to surgery were found to be significantly associated with SD more than 2 cm away from the scar ( both p < 0.05). The presence of SD was not associated with significant pain. Conclusions SDs are common after open hernia surgery , but are not associated with persistent postoperative pain.
