  To determine if tumors located in the subcapsular space or in proximity to vessels would be a risk factor of local tumor progression ( LTP A search of the MEDLINE , EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases from 1998 to 2017 was performed to identify studies examining the risk factors of LTP after radiofrequency ablation ( RFA There were 16 studies included , of which 7 were focused on the association of LTP with tumors abutting vessels , and 15 focused on tumors of subcapsular location. In total , 2870 patients were included. Tumors that were located in the subcapsular area had a higher occurrence of LTP ( P = 0.04) with a high heterogeneity ( I The findings of the present meta-analysis indicate that the subscapsular location is a possible risk factor of LTP. Nevertheless , a clear definition or classification of the subcapsular location should be highlighted in future studies. Whether tumor location adjacent to a vessel has an influence on the incidence of LTP remains controversial , and more relevant research should be performed.
