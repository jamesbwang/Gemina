  BACKGROUND In many studies , confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE) has proven to be a useful tool in pulmonology; nevertheless , the application in this field is still experimental. By contrast , CLE is almost a standard technique in gastroenterology. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the identification of bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL) components applying CLE , using a dye. MATERIAL AND METHODS In 21 patients with various underlying diseases a bronchoscopy with BAL was performed. As in routine clinical practice common , BAL fluid ( BALF) was analyzed in terms of cytologic , virologic , and microbiologic aspects. To one fraction of BALF , we added acriflavine. After centrifugation CLE was applied and the video sequences were analyzed by an experienced investigator. RESULTS Using CLE , BALF components ( such as alveolar macrophages or leucocytes) could be easily identified. A further subdivision of leucocytes ( neutrophilic , eosinophilic granulocytes , and lymphocytes) was not possible. Analogous to conventional cytology , a precise distinction of lymphocyte<symptom> subpopulation ( cd 4/cd 8 ratio) was not feasible. In terms of quantification , this is still the application field of flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSIONS Using CLE , alveolar macrophages and leucocytes in stained BALF can be differentiated independent of smoking status. Further studies should be initiated in order to subclassify leucocytes in eosinophilic , neutrophilic granulocytes , and lymphocytes , which is important for routine clinical practice.
