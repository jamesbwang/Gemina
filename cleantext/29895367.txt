  Multi-element determination in human samples is very challenging. Especially in human intervention studies sample volumes are often limited to a few microliters and due to the high number of samples a high-throughput is indispensable. Here , we present a state-of-the-art ICP-MS/MS-based method for the analysis of essential ( trace) elements , namely Mg , Ca , Fe , Cu , Zn , Mo , Se and I , as well as food-relevant toxic elements such as As and Cd. The developed method was validated regarding linearity of the calibration curves , method LODs and LOQs , selectivity and trueness as well as precision. The established reliable method was applied to quantify the element serum concentrations of participants of a human intervention study ( LeguAN). The participants received isocaloric diets , either rich in plant protein or in animal protein. While the serum concentrations of Mg and Mo increased in participants receiving the plant protein-based diet ( above all legumes) , the Se concentration in serum decreased. In contrast , the animal protein-based diet , rich in meat and dairy products , resulted in an increased Se concentration in serum.
