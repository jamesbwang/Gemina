  To date , little is known about the effects of violence on the educational outcomes of adolescents in disadvantaged communities in South Africa. In response , self-report data were collected from a socioeconomically disadvantaged sample of 503 adolescents aged 10 to 18 participating in a child abuse prevention trial in the Eastern Cape. Adolescents were purposively selected in the trial. This study applies Latent Profile Analysis ( LPA) to examine relationships between past-month exposure to violence , school delay , and academic motivation. About 93.8 % of adolescents in the sample experienced poly-violence-exposure to at least two forms of violence in the past month. Results identified two distinct profiles in the socioeconomically disadvantaged sample: Profile 1 , adolescents exposed to more frequent poly-violence , and Profile 2 , adolescents exposed to less frequent poly-violence. Being exposed to more frequent poly-violence was associated with greater risk of school delay-based on age-appropriate grade in South Africa. However , being exposed to more frequent poly-violence was not associated with lower academic motivation-adolescents showed high rates of wanting to achieve. Our findings suggest that exposure to more frequent poly-violence increases risk of school delay among adolescents from disadvantaged communities , while not affecting their academic motivation. Thus , although adolescents maintained aspirations and goals to do well at school , exposure to high frequency of violence affected their capacity to fulfill these aims.
