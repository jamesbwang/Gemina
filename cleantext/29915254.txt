  The heart consumes large amounts of energy in the form of ATP that is continuously replenished by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and , to a lesser extent , by glycolysis. To adapt the ATP supply efficiently to the constantly varying demand of cardiac myocytes , a complex network of enzymatic and signalling pathways controls the metabolic flux of substrates towards their oxidation in mitochondria. In patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , derangements of substrate utilization and intermediate metabolism , an energetic deficit , and oxidative stress are thought to underlie contractile dysfunction and the progression of the disease. In this Review , we give an overview of the physiological processes of cardiac energy metabolism and their pathological alterations in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and diabetes mellitus. Although the energetic deficit in failing hearts- discovered > 2 decades ago- might account for contractile dysfunction during maximal exertion , we suggest that the alterations of intermediate substrate metabolism and oxidative stress rather than an ATP deficit per se account for maladaptive cardiac remodelling and dysfunction under resting conditions. Treatments targeting substrate utilization and/or oxidative stress in mitochondria are currently being tested in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and might be promising tools to improve cardiac function beyond that achieved with neuroendocrine inhibition.
