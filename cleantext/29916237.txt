  The effect of postannealing on the device characteristics is systematically investigated. The external quantum efficiency ( EQE) of blue quantum-dot light-emitting diodes ( QLEDs) is significantly improved from 5.22 to 9.81 % after postannealing. Similar results are obtained in green and red QLEDs , whose EQEs are enhanced from 11.47 and 13.60 to 15.57 and 16.59 % , respectively. The annealed devices also exhibit a larger current density. The origin of efficiency improvement is thoroughly investigated. Our finding indicates that postannealing promotes the interfacial reaction of Al and ZnMgO and consequently leads to the metallization of the AlZnMgO contact and the formation of the AlO
