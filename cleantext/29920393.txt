  Pediatric hydrocephalus<symptom> is a health burden for East African countries , with an estimated incidence of 6000 new cases per year. The objective of this study is to describe the epidemiology and surgical outcomes of patients treated for pediatric hydrocephalus<symptom> in the single neurosurgical center of Zanzibar. From December 2016 to December 2017 , we prospectively collected data on all patients admitted with the diagnosis of hydrocephalus<symptom>. Information was gathered regarding demographics , maternal health , preoperative imaging , surgical procedures , and postsurgical complications. We collected data on 63 patients. Average age was 203 days , and gender was 49.2 % female and 50.8 % male. All mothers of patients attended an antenatal clinic for routine screening during pregnancy. Folic acid prophylaxis was used by 9.5 % of the mothers during pregnancy. At the first visit , 46.0 % of patients presented with signs of infection , 20.6 % with congenital abnormalities , and 20.6 % with seizures<symptom>. Regarding etiology of hydrocephalus<symptom> , 22.2 % of all cases were uncertain; 20.6 % were associated with neural tube defects; 39.7 % were postinfectious hydrocephalus<symptom>; 3.2 % were aqueduct stenosis; 4.8 % were associated with brain tumor; and 9.6 % were malformative. We performed 7 endoscopic third ventriculostomies and placed 40 ventriculoperitoneal shunts. The complication rate at follow-up was 12.5 %. It seems that hydrocephalus<symptom> in Zanzibar has similar causes , progression , and complication rates to previous reports from other African hospitals. Further studies of postinfectious hydrocephalus<symptom> need to be conducted because recent findings suggest that it is a potentially preventable cause of the disease.
