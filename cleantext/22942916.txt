  Rolling bearings play a crucial role in rotary machinery systems , and their operating state affects the entire mechanical system. In most cases , the fault of a rolling bearing can only be identified when it has developed to a certain degree. At that moment , there is already not much time for maintenance , and could cause serious damage to the entire mechanical system. This paper proposes a novel approach to health degradation monitoring and early fault diagnosis of rolling bearings based on a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise ( CEEMDAN) and improved multivariate multiscale sample entropy ( MMSE). The smoothed coarse graining process was proposed to improve the conventional MMSE. Numerical simulation results indicate that CEEMDAN can alleviate the mode mixing problem and enable accurate intrinsic mode functions ( IMFs) , and improved MMSE can reflect intrinsic dynamic characteristics of the rolling bearing more accurately. During application studies , rolling bearing signals are decomposed by CEEMDAN to obtain IMFs. Then improved MMSE values of effective IMFs are computed to accomplish health degradation monitoring of rolling bearings , aiming at identifying the early weak fault phase. Afterwards , CEEMDAN is performed to extract the fault characteristic frequency during the early weak fault phase. The experimental results indicate the proposed method can obtain a better performance than other techniques in objective analysis , which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in practical application. The theoretical derivations , numerical simulations , and application studies all confirmed that the proposed health degradation monitoring and early fault diagnosis approach is promising in the field of prognostic and fault diagnosis of rolling bearings.
