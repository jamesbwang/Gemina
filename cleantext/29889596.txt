  Retinoids exert their biologic effects by binding to intracellular retinoic-acid receptors ( RARs) and/or retinoid X receptors ( RXRs). Early-stage mycosis<disease> fungoides ( MF) has been effectively treated with bexarotene , an RXR-agonist , with overall response ( OR) rates 54-67 % and complete response ( CR) rates 7-27 %. Data on RAR-agonist monotherapy are limited. To analyze the effectiveness of RAR-agonist monotherapy for early-stage MF. Data on patients with early-stage MF treated with acitretin/isotretinoin monotherapy at a tertiary cutaneous lymphoma clinic in 2010-2017 were collected retrospectively from the medical files. Thirty-five patients ( 26 males) of median age 50 years ( range 8-83) with early-stage MF ( IA 9 , IB 26) underwent 37 treatment events: 25 acitretin and 12 isotretinoin at a median dosages of 0.3 mg/kg ( range 0.2-0.9) and 0.2 mg/kg ( range 0.1-0.7) , respectively. Median time to maximal response was 6 months for both ( range 1-10 for acitretin , 3-16 for isotretinoin); median treatment duration was 10 months ( range 3-46) for acitretin , and 9 months ( range 3-55) for isotretinoin. OR was 64 % for acitretin and 80 % for isotretinoin , and CR , 4 % and 8 % , respectively. Side-effect profiles were as previously reported for retinoids. Early-stage MF patients may benefit from low dose RAR-agonist monotherapy , although the CR rate is low.
