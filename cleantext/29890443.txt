  This study characterized the microbial diversity of formed biofilm on the surface of acrylic resins modified with nanostructured silver vanadate decorated with silver nanoparticles ( AgVO Resin specimens prepared with AgVO Significant differences in the dispersion pattern of the nanoparticles were observed among the two different methods of AgVO The results show differences in relation to the microbial diversity of modified resins during the initial phase of biofilm maturation. The incorporation of AgVO
