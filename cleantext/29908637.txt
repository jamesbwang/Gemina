  Stress during pregnancy is known to have negative effects on fetal outcome. The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine placental perfusion alterations after stress challenge during pregnancy in a mouse model. Seven Tesla MRI was performed on pregnant mice at embrionic day ( ED) 14.5 and 16.5. Twenty dams were exposed to an established acoustic stress challenge model while twenty non-exposed dams served as controls. Placental perfusion was analyzed in dynamic contrast-enhanced ( DCE) MRI using the steepest slope model. The two functional placental compartments , the highly vascularized labyrinth and the endocrine junctional zone , were assessed separately. Statistical analysis revealed decreased perfusion levels in the stress group at ED 14.5 compared to controls in both placenta compartments. On ED 16.5 , the perfusion level increased significantly in the stress group while placenta perfusion in controls remained similar or even slightly decreased leading to an overall increased perfusion in the stress group on ED 16.5 compared to controls. MR imaging allows noninvasive placenta perfusion assessment in this fetal stress mimicking animal model. In this exploratory study , we demonstrated that stress challenge during pregnancy leads to an initial reduction followed by an increase of placenta perfusion.
