  The spliceosome ( SPL) is a majestic macromolecular machinery composed of five small nuclear RNAs and hundreds of proteins. SPL removes noncoding introns from precursor messenger RNAs ( pre-mRNAs) and ligates coding exons , giving rise to functional mRNAs. Building on the first SPL structure solved at near-atomic-level resolution , here we elucidate the functional dynamics of the intron lariat spliceosome ( ILS) complex<pathogen> through multi-microsecond-long molecular-dynamics simulations of âˆ¼ 1,000,000 atoms models. The ILS essential dynamics unveils (
