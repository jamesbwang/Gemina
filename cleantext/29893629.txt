  In this paper we examine the perceptions and experiences of childbirth among a group of wealthier women in Dhaka through in-depth interviews. We find that a number of factors including preference for Caesarean Section ( CS) , socio-economic position , family structure , and perceptions of modern childbirth contributed to the women 's overuse of medical childbirth services. Furthermore , women 's capacity to purchase modern maternal health care in the private sector did not necessarily ensure high quality care in a health system which approaches maternal healthcare as a profit-making enterprise rather than as an essential human right.
