  Natural killer ( NK)/ T-cell lymphoma is formally referred to as extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma , nasal type ( ENKTCL) , in the 2008 and 2016 World Health Organization ( WHO) classifications. NK/T-cell lymphoma , nasal type , is a rare but clinically important lymphoid neoplasm. It is the predominant type of extranodal lymphoma associated with the Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV). NK/T-cell lymphoma is marked by a wide cytomorphological spectrum. The cytological findings may be so subtle that NK/T-cell lymphoma could possibly be easily overlooked. Here , we report a case of NK/T-cell lymphoma involving the sinonasal region with lymph node involvement. Fine needle aspiration of the neck<symptom> lymph node and punch biopsy of the nasal mucosa were performed. The diagnosis of NK/T-cell lymphoma was confirmed based on pathological and immunohistochemical analyses , as well as in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded mRNA ( EBER). The present case report underlines the importance of prompt clinicopathological assessment in suspected cases. The comparison of cytomorphologic features of NK/T-cell lymphoma in various specimens is presented.
