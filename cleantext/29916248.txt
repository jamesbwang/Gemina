  In quantum metrology , semiconductor single-electron pumps are used to generate accurate electric currents with the ultimate goal of implementing the emerging quantum standard of the ampere. Pumps based on electrostatically defined tunable quantum dots ( QDs) have thus far shown the most promising performance in combining fast and accurate charge transfer. However , at frequencies exceeding approximately 1 GHz the accuracy typically decreases. Recently , hybrid pumps based on QDs coupled to trap states have led to increased transfer rates due to tighter electrostatic confinement. Here , we operate a hybrid electron pump in silicon obtained by coupling a QD to multiple parasitic states and achieve robust current quantization up to a few gigahertz. We show that the fidelity of the electron capture depends on the sequence in which the parasitic states become available for loading , resulting in distinctive frequency-dependent features in the pumped current.
