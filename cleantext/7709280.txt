  The purpose of the current study was ( 1) to examine the differences between standing and lying measures of vastus lateralis ( VL) , muscle thickness ( MT) , pennation angle ( PA) , and cross-sectional area ( CSA) using ultrasonography; and ( 2) to explore the relationships between lying and standing measures with isometric and dynamic assessments of force production-specifically peak force , rate of force development ( RFD) , impulse , and one-repetition maximum back squat. Fourteen resistance-trained subjects ( age = 26.8 ± 4.0 years , height = 181.4 ± 6.0 cm , body mass = 89.8 ± 10.7 kg , back squat to body mass ratio = 1.84 ± 0.34) agreed to participate. Lying and standing ultrasonography images of the right VL were collected following 48 hours of rest. Isometric squat assessments followed ultrasonography , and were performed on force platforms with data used to determine isometric peak force ( IPF) , as well as RFD and impulse at various time points. Forty-eight hours later , one-repetition maximum back squats were performed by each subject. Paired-samples t-tests revealed statistically significant differences between standing and lying measurements of MT (
