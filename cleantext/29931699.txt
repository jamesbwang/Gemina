  Self-organization in synthetic chemical systems is quickly developing into a powerful strategy for designing new functional materials. As self-organization requires the system to exist far from thermodynamic equilibrium , chemists have begun to go beyond the classical equilibrium self-assembly that is often applied in bottom-up supramolecular synthesis , and to learn about the surprising and unpredicted emergent properties of chemical systems that are characterized by a higher level of complexity and extended reactivity networks. The present review focuses on self-organization in reaction-diffusion systems. Selected examples show how the emergence of complex morphogenesis is feasible in synthetic systems leading to hierarchically and nanostructured matter. Starting from well-investigated oscillating reactions , recent developments extend diffusion-limited reactivity to supramolecular systems. The concept of dynamic instability is introduced and illustrated as an additional tool for the design of smart materials and actuators , with emphasis on the realization of motion even at the macroscopic scale. The formation of spatio-temporal patterns along diffusive chemical gradients is exploited as the main channel to realize symmetry breaking and therefore anisotropic and directional mechanical transformations. Finally , the interaction between external perturbations and chemical gradients is explored to give mechanistic insights in the design of materials responsive to external stimuli.
