  We analyzed the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2011 data to examine absolute differences in hypertension prevalence according to the hypertension definition of the `` 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ( 2017 ACC/AHA) Guideline for the Prevention , Detection , Evaluation , and Management of High Blood<symptom> Pressure<symptom> in Adults '' and `` Seventh Joint National Committee on Prevention , Detection , Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood<symptom> Pressure<symptom> ( JNC7) '' 2003 guidelines. Among 7839 participants ≥ 35 years , the JNC7 and 2017 ACC/AHA classified 25.7 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 24.5-27.0 %) and 48.0 % ( 95 % CI: 46.4-49.7 %) people hypertensive , respectively. The JNC7 prevalence was 19.4 % ( 95 % CI: 18.0-21.0 %) among males and 31.9 % ( 95 % CI: 30.1-33.6 %) among females. The prevalence was 41.4 % ( 95 % CI: 39.4-43.5 %) among males and 54.5 % ( 95 % CI: 52.4-56.4 %) among females as per the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. From JNC7 to 2017 ACC/AHA , the overall difference in prevalence was 22.3 % ( 95 % CI: 19.8-24.8 %). Males and females had similar differences , 22.0 % ( 95 % CI: 18.3-25.7 %) and 22.6 % ( 95 % CI: 19.4-26.0 %) , respectively. As per the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline , > 50 % prevalence was observed among people with body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m
