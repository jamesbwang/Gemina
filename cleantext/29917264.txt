  The human sliding clamp ( PCNA) controls access to DNA for many proteins involved in DNA replication and repair. Proteins are recruited to the PCNA surface by means of a short , conserved peptide motif known as the PCNA-interacting protein box ( PIP-box). Inhibitors of these essential protein-protein interactions may be useful as cancer therapeutics by disrupting DNA replication and repair in these highly proliferative cells. PIP-box peptide mimetics have been identified as a potentially rapid route to potent PCNA inhibitors. Here we describe the rational design and synthesis of the first PCNA peptidomimetic ligands , based on the high affinity PIP-box sequence from the natural PCNA inhibitor p21. These mimetics incorporate covalent i , i +4 side-chain/side-chain lactam linkages of different lengths , designed to constrain the peptides into the 3
