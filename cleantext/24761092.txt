  The skin rejuvenation potential of the autologous emulsified nanofat was studied by Tonnard A total of 34 patients with scars of varied aetiologies were included in the study as per inclusion criteria. Pre-operative scoring of the scars with the POSAS scale was done , and photographs were taken. Fat aspiration was done from the lower abdominal wall using syringe liposuction under tumescent anaesthesia. The lipoaspirate was mechanically emulsified , filtered and injected intralesionally into the scar using 26G needle and insulin syringe. Post-operative scar reassessment was done at 3 months with the POSAS scale score and photographs. The improvement in scar characteristics and symptoms were tested statistically using a paired Out of the 34 patients included in the study , male: female ratio was 22:12. Majority ( 79.4 %) had post-traumatic facial scars. On statistical analysis , there was statistically significant improvement in symptoms such as pain ( Autologous emulsified nanofat injection is effective in improving the scar characteristics as well as symptoms and helps in scar rejuvenation.
