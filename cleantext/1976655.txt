  The angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE) I/D polymorphism has been reported to be associated with Kawasaki disease ( KD) , but studies to date present conflicting results. The aim of this study is to derive a more precise estimation of the association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and KD risk. PubMed , EMBASE , CNKI and Wangfang databases were retrievaled to identify for relevant studies from inception to May 2017. Pooled odds ratios ( OR) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) were calculated using Stata 12.0 software. A total of 6 case-control studies comprising 634 patients and 458 controls were included in the meta-analysis , and we found a significant association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and KD risk ( D vs I: OR = 0.81 , 95 % CI = 0.31-2.11; DD vs II: OR = 1.03 , 95 % CI = 0.42-2.54; DI vs II: OR = 1.44 , 95 % CI = 1.09-1.90; dominant model: OR = 1.43 , 95 % CI = 1.11-1.85; recessive model: OR = 1.21 , 95 % CI = 0.44-3.29). When stratified by sample size > 200 , this polymorphism is associated with an increased the risk of KD. The I/D polymorphism in the ACE gene may be associated with susceptibility to KD.
