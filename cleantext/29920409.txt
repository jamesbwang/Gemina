  Ferrocene functionalized graphene based graphite felt electrode was firstly investigated for heterogeneous electro-Fenton oxidation of ciprofloxacin in neutral pH condition. Electrochemical reduction of Ferrocene functionalized graphene oxide ( Fc-ErGO) was performed by cyclic voltammetry technique. At neutral pH condition , Fc-ErGO electrode ( 0.035 min
