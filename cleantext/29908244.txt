  Uridine triacetate has been shown to be an effective antidote against mortality and toxicity caused by either overdoses or exaggerated susceptibility to the widely used anticancer agents 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU) and capecitabine. However , a direct assessment of efficacy based on when emergency treatment was initiated was not clinically feasible. In this study we used mouse models of 5-FU overdose and of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD) deficiency to compare the efficacy of uridine triacetate in reducing toxicity and mortality when treatment was initiated at time points from 4 to 144 h after administration of 5-FU. We found that uridine triacetate was effective both in the 5-FU overdose and DPD deficiency models. Starting treatment within 24 h was most effective at reducing toxicity and mortality in both models , while treatment starting more than 96 to 120 h after 5-FU was far less effective. Uridine triacetate also reduced mortality in the DPD deficiency model when mice were treated with the 5-FU prodrug capecitabine. The results of this study are supportive of clinical observations and practice , indicating that efficacy declined progressively with later and later treatment initiation. Prompt treatment with uridine triacetate , within 24 h , conferred the greatest protection against 5-FU overexposure.
