  Microbial life inhabiting subseafloor sediments plays an important role in Earth 's carbon cycle. However , the impact of geodynamic processes on the distributions and carbon-cycling activities of subseafloor life remains poorly constrained. We explore a submarine mud volcano of the Nankai accretionary complex by drilling down to 200 m below the summit. Stable isotopic compositions of water and carbon compounds , including clumped methane isotopologues , suggest that ~ 90 % of methane is microbially produced at 16 ° to 30 °C and 300 to 900 m below seafloor , corresponding to the basin bottom , where fluids in the accretionary prism are supplied via megasplay faults. Radiotracer experiments showed that relatively small microbial populations in deep mud volcano sediments ( 10
