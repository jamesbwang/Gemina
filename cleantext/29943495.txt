  The Mukaiyama aldol reaction is a widely applied carbon-carbon bond forming reaction. However , despite numerous well-established methods using aldehydes as acceptors , only few examples exist with ketones. Herein we report a highly practical catalytic approach to this transformation , namely , the triflimide catalyzed Mukaiyama aldol reaction of silyl ketene acetals with ketones. This method exhibits a broad substrate scope , is very rapid , tolerates functionalized substrates , and requires only parts-per-million catalyst loadings with preparative scale reactions up to hundreds of grams in excellent purity ( > 99 %).
