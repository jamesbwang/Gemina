  Depression<symptom> is a severe mental disorder. However , the neural mechanisms underlying affective interference ( difficulties in directing attention away from negative distractors) in depression<symptom> patients are still not well-understood. In particular , the connections between brain regions remain unclear. Using the emotional face-word Stroop task , we aimed to reveal the altered electroencephalography ( EEG) functional connectivity in patients with depression<symptom> , using concepts from event-related potentials ( ERPs) and time series clustering. In this study , the EEG signals of ten healthy participants and ten depression<symptom> patients were collected from a 64-sensor cap. Subsequently , EEG signals were segmented into temporal windows corresponding to the ERPs. For each duration , the dynamic time warping algorithm was used to calculate the similarities between EEG signals from different electrodes , and differences of these similarities were compared between the groups. Finally , hierarchical clustering was used to identify functionally connected regions and examine changes in depression<symptom> It was observed that during the time interval of 400-600 ms ( N450 components) , depression<symptom> patients had more long-range connections than did healthy control patients and exhibited abnormal functional connectivity via the superior and middle frontal gyrus , specifically , the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DL-PFC , Brodmann 's area 8 and 9) , which is related to the control and resolution of affective interference. Moreover , the functionally connected region of depression<symptom> patients was much larger than that of healthy participants , which is caused by brain resource reorganization. These findings thus provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of depression<symptom> and further identify the DL-PFC and connections between certain electrodes as quantitative indicators of
