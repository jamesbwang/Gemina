  Whether and how context plays a role in metaphor processing remains a controversial issue. One major theory on metaphor comprehension , the graded salience hypothesis ( GSH) model , emphasizes salience as the key factor determining the precedence of semantic access. Using event-related potential technique , the present study examined Chinese metaphors to investigate whether the salient meaning is always processed first regardless of context. The experiment employed a Prime-Target-Probe paradigm. Three-character Chinese verb-object metaphors were used as the Target proceeded by one of the three contexts ( the Prime): ( 1) metaphorical context priming the Target 's metaphorical meaning , ( 2) literal context priming the Target 's literal meaning , and ( 3) irrelevant context as the control condition. The Target was then followed by the Probe , which was always related to the Target ( except in the filler condition). Forty participants were asked to judge whether the Target and the following Probe were semantically related. The N400 elicited by the Target showed no contextual effect. The N400 amplitude elicited by the Probe was smaller in the metaphorical priming condition compared with the literal priming condition , while the N400 in the irrelevant control condition was between the other two conditions , demonstrating a clear context effect. In addition , an unexpected P240 component also showed the similar graded pattern. Our results mostly support the GSH model , indicating that the salient meaning invariantly gets activated first before the activation of the nonsalient meaning at the lexical access stage. However , context does play a role in a parallel way either facilitating or suppressing this interpretation in the latter meaning integration stage.
