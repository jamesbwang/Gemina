  Laponite nanoparticles have attracted attention in the tissue engineering field for their protein interactions , gel-forming properties , and , more recently , osteogenic bioactivity. Despite growing interest in the osteogenic properties of Laponite , the application of Laponite colloidal gels to host the osteogenic differentiation of responsive stem cell populations remains unexplored. Here , the potential to harness the gel-forming properties of Laponite to generate injectable bioactive microenvironments for osteogenesis is demonstrated. A diffusion/dialysis gelation method allows the rapid formation of stable transparent gels from injectable , thixotropic Laponite suspensions in physiological fluids. Upon contact with buffered saline or blood serum , nanoporous gel networks exhibiting , respectively , fivefold and tenfold increases in gel stiffness are formed due to the reorganization of nanoparticle interactions. Laponite diffusion gels are explored as osteogenic microenvironments for skeletal stem cell containing populations. Laponite films support cell adhesion , proliferation , and differentiation of human bone<disease> marrow stromal cells in 2D. Laponite gel encapsulation significantly enhances osteogenic protein expression compared with 3D pellet culture controls. In both 2D and 3D conditions , cell associated mineralization is strongly enhanced. This study demonstrates that Laponite diffusion gels offer considerable potential as biologically active and clinically relevant bone tissue engineering scaffolds.
