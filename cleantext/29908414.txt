  In order to improve the metabolism of pirfenidone ( 5-methyl-1-phenylpyridin-2-one , PFD) , the methyl-deuterated version of pirfenidone via the substitution of hydrogen ( H) at C-5 by its isotope deuterium ( D , 5D-PFD) was synthesized and its photophysical properties were investigated. The negative solvatochrom was observed in absorption and fluorescence spectra with increasing solvent polarity , which implied that intermolecular charge transfer ( ICT) involved n → π * transition for both of PFD and 5D-PFD. The ground state and excited state dipole moment was calculated as 5.30 D and 3.30 D for PFD , and 3.70 D and 2.18 D for 5D-PFD , respectively , which suggested the more polar nature of PFD in the ground state than that of excited state compared with 5D-PFD. Density functional theory ( DFT) results demonstrated a significant propensity of ICT from the electron-donor , methyl and carbonyl group to the amine group as an electron donor. The binding of metal ions with PFD or 5D-PFD induced a red-shift of π → π * transition and blue-shift of n → π * transition , respectively , indicating that the pyridone ring showed more stability upon binding of unoccupied orbital of metal ions with lone-pair electron of oxygen atom and thus prompted the electronic distribution on phenyl unit. Upon addition of metal ions , the aromatic region presented the characteristic upfield shifts , and the resonance contributed by 3-H showed a significant downfield chemical shift/deshielding effect , indicating the deduced resonance of 3-H and the improved electron distribution of phenyl unit. The binding and docking of human serum albumin showed that the affinity of 5D-PFD with HSA was lower than that of PFD , and also 5D-PFD might prefer to present free forms in the blood with better efficacy comparing with PFD.
