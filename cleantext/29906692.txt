  Emerging personality organization may play an important role in the psychological adjustment of early adolescents , but research in this area is still limited. The current study evaluated if personality organization moderates the association between rejection sensitivity and adverse psychological outcomes in early adolescence. Three-hundred eighty-six early adolescents ( age range 13-15 years; 51 % Female) attending junior high schools in Italy completed the semi-structured Interview of Personality Organization Processes in Adolescence ( IPOP-A) , the Children 's Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire ( CRSQ) , and the Youth Self Report/11 -18 ( YSR). Disruption in the emerging personality organization was associated with increasing symptom problems in early adolescence. Conversely , the successful development of personality organization buffered the relation between rejection sensitivity and negative psychological outcomes ( i.e. , conduct and affective problems). These findings encourage to accurately evaluate personality organization in adolescence , in order to take into account difficulties but also strengths in personality organization when treating early adolescents.
