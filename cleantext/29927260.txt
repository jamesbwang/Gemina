  The power of nature to both heal and inspire awe has been noted by many great thinkers. However , no study has examined how the impact of nature on well-being and stress-related symptoms is explained by experiences of awe. In the present investigation , we examine this process in studies of extraordinary and everyday nature experiences. In Study 1 , awe experienced by military veterans and youth from underserved communities while whitewater<disease> rafting , above and beyond all the other positive emotions measured , predicted changes in well-being and stress-related symptoms one week later. In Study 2 , the nature experiences that undergraduate students had during their everyday lives led to more awe , which mediated the effect of nature experience on improvements in well-being. We discuss how accounting for people 's emotional experiences during outdoors activities can increase our understanding of how nature impacts people 's well-being. ( PsycINFO Database Record
