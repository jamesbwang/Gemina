  The study was conducted to investigate the short-term complications and prognostic factors in patients with esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma ( EGJA). This retrospective study included 110 EGJA patients who underwent surgery from January 2010 to November 2012 at The First Affiliated Hospital of BengBu Medical College. The overall survival and short-term complications were analyzed according to the patients ' clinical characteristics. The incidence of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications was significantly higher in patients with preoperative cardiopulmonary disease or elderly patients ( P < 0.05). Four cases of upper margin cancer residue were detected using the abdominal approach and three using the thoracic approach , which indicated that the cancer residue margin was related to surgical approach. The overall five-year survival rate was 34.3 % and statistically differed according to pathological stage and en block resection ( P Elderly patients with preoperative cardiopulmonary disease had an increased risk of developing postoperative cardiopulmonary complications. Lymph node status and depth of tumor invasion were independent factors related to patient prognosis.
