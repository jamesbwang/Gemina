  To validate a newly introduced cartilage rim augmented temporalis fascia tympanoplasty technique by statistically comparing it with the morphological and audiological outcomes of traditional temporalis fascia tympanoplasty. A retrospective comparative study was conducted on 115 patients who underwent tympanoplasty during 2013 and 2015. Fifty-eight patients underwent temporalis fascia tympanoplasty and 57 underwent cartilage rim augmented fascia tympanoplasty. In the cartilage fascia group , graft healing was achieved in 94.7 per cent of cases; in the temporalis fascia group , the graft take-up rate was 70 per cent. In those with a normal ossicular chain , the post-operative air-bone gap was within 20 dB in 92.6 per cent of cartilage fascia group cases and in 69.7 per cent of the temporalis fascia group cases , which was a statistically significant difference. Among the defective ossicular chain cases , the post-operative air-bone gap was within 20 dB in 76.9 per cent in the cartilage fascia group , as against 57.1 per cent in the temporalis fascia group. Cartilage rim augmented temporalis fascia tympanoplasty has a definite advantage over the temporalis fascia technique in terms of superior graft take up and statistically significant hearing gain in those with normal ossicular mobility.
