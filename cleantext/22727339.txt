  Ankle , hindfoot , and toe stiffness can result from hindfoot trauma. It can be due to capsular fibrosis<disease> , tendon adhesion , muscle fibrosis<disease> , or malunion. For symptomatic stiffness that is resistant to nonoperative treatment , operative treatment should be considered. It is important to tackle the sources of stiffness , and careful preoperative clinical assessment is the key for proper formulation of the surgical plan. Whenever possible , arthroscopic/endoscopic surgery is preferable to open surgery because less extensive dissection and small surgical incisions allow immediate vigorous mobilization of the foot and ankle.
