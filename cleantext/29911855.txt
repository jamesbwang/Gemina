  The device performance of inverted organic metallohalide perovskite solar cells ( OMPSCs) is optimized via tailoring the electrode surfaces with electron- and hole-transporting materials. This work demonstrates the fabrication of PEDOT: PSS-free OMPSCs using a hole-transporting composite material consisting of bilayered vanadium oxide ( VO
