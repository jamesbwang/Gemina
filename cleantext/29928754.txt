  The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of the pre-surgical assessment of the mandible using cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT) images. For surgical procedures in the mandible , it is important to determine the position of the mandibular canal in order to avoid damage to the inferior alveolar nerve ( IAN). The best method to investigate this nerve is with the help of panoramic reconstructed images combined with cross-sectional reconstructed images. To protect the IAN during treatment , this research indicates that a minimal safety zone of 1.13 mm is advisable. When distances were being measured , a larger exaggeration of reality was observed with small distances. It appears that ( semi) automatic tracing methods of the mandibular canal still can not be used in clinical practice. When a CBCT scan reveals a lingual position of the mandibular canal in combination with a narrowing of the mandibular canal at the contact point with the root of a third molar the risk of damaging the IAN increases. CBCT imaging should only be applied in specific cases.
