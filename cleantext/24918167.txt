  This study describes a restriction fragment polymorphism protocol for rapidly screening the polymorphism SLCO1B1 c. 1929A > C in genomic DNA samples. The polymorphism SLCO1B1 c. 1929A > C has been associated with increased activity resulting in increased hepatic uptake of drugs. Currently SLCO1B1 c. 1929A > C is genotyped using direct sequencing techniques and 5 ' nuclease based assays which can be cost prohibiting in resource limited settings. The aim of this study therefore was to design and validate a cost effective RFLP for genotyping the SLCO1B1 c. 1929A > C polymorphism. This study was designed to investigate the effect of the polymorphism SLCO1B1 c. 1929A > C on interindividual variability in rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers of African descent. We describe a restriction fragment length polymorphism method to genotype SLCO1B1 c. 1929A > C polymorphism using the restriction enzyme Ase1. A student 's t test with Welch correction was used to establish association between the SLCO1B1 c. 1929A > C variant and rosuvastatin exposure. The frequency of the SLCO1B1 c. 1929C allele amongst Zimbabweans was 6 %. The SLCO1B1 c. 1929C allele was associated with a 75 % reduction ( P < 0.001) in rosuvastatin exposure when compared to individuals carrying the wild type SLCO1B1 c. 1929A allele. Polymorphism c. 1929A > C may therefore play a significant role in rosuvastatin response. The RFLP method is quick and cost effective.
