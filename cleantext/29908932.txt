  To establish and compare the incidence of 30-day postoperative infection in surgically managed open and closed metacarpal and phalangeal fractures , and to determine whether open fractures treated urgently had a lower incidence of postoperative infection. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patient demographics , comorbidities , and 30-day infection rates of patients undergoing operative fixation of metacarpal , proximal , or middle phalanx fractures from 2008 to 2015 using the American College of Surgeons ' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. A total of 3,506 patients were identified and patient variables and infection incidence were compared between open and closed injuries , as well as open injuries managed within 1 day of admission and those treated on an elective basis or treated more than 1 day after admission. Bivariate analysis was used to determine independent risk factors for postoperative infection. Although 34.2 % of open hand fractures were taken urgently to the operating room , the diagnosis of open fractures along with nonurgent surgical treatment for open fractures was associated with a low incidence of postoperative infection. In addition , smoking was a risk factor for postoperative infection although anatomic location ( phalanx vs metacarpal) was not. Patients undergoing surgery for metacarpal or proximal/middle phalangeal fractures are not at greater risk for infection based on the diagnosis of open fracture alone. In addition , patients with open fractures who are taken to the operating room more than 1 day from presentation did not have a higher incidence of infection. Smoking is associated with increased 30-day infection rates after surgery , and surgeons should identify these patients for preoperative risk stratification , counseling , and postoperative wound<disease> monitoring.
