  The ubiquitin regulatory X domain-containing proteins ( UBXNs) are likely involved in diverse biological processes. Their physiological functions , however , remain largely unknown. Here we present physiological evidence that UBXN3B positively regulates stimulator-of-interferon genes ( STING) signaling. We employ a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-LoxP approach to generate systemic Ubxn3b knockout in adult mice as the Ubxn3b-null mutation is embryonically lethal. Ubxn3b
