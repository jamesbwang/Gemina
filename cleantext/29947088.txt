  Parkinson 's disease ( PD)- related fatigue<symptom> is a significant clinical problem , and the pathological processes that cause fatigue<symptom> remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the possible association of peripheral inflammation<symptom> markers and fatigue<symptom> in PD. We included 47 drug naïve , newly diagnosed PD patients with low ( ≤ 3.0) or high ( > 5.5) fatigue<symptom> levels as evaluated by the Fatigue<symptom> Severity Scale ( FSS). Strict diagnostic criteria were applied for inclusion. Patients with possible confounding causes for fatigue<symptom> were excluded. Serum concentrations of a panel of inflammatory markers ( IL-8 , TNF-α , MCP1 , MIP-1β , IL-6 , IL-6R , p-selectin , E-selectin-1 , ICAM , VCAM-1 , CCL5 , IL1-Ra , and TNFR1) were measured using ELISA technology in PD patients with and without fatigue<symptom> to assess the potential relationships of fatigue<symptom> in newly diagnosed , treatment-naïve patients. Fatigued PD patients had significantly higher levels of the IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL1-Ra) ( 1790 pg/mL ( SD1007) vs 1262 pg/mL ( SD379)) and of the adhesion molecule VCAM 1 ( 1071 ng/mL ( SD276) vs 895 ng/mL ( SD229)) than non-fatigued patients. A binary logistic regression model , including high or low FSS score as the dependent variable and UPDRS motor score , MADRS , MMSE , ESS , and IL1-Ra/VCAM -1 as independent variables , showed a significant effect both for IL1-Ra and VCAM-1. Higher serum levels of the inflammatory molecules IL1-Ra and VCAM-1 were associated with higher fatigue<symptom> levels in patients with newly diagnosed , drug-naïve PD. These findings highlight an altered immune response as a potential contributor to PD-related fatigue<symptom> , from the earliest clinical stages of the disease.
