  The roles of different amino acid residues towards binding and selective transport of K + ion in the selectivity filter of the bacterial K + ion channel , KcsA , were explored. The selectivity filter of KcsA contains amino acids threonine ( THR-75) , valine ( VAL-76) , glycine ( GLY-77) and tyrosine ( TYR-78) from intracellular to extracellular regions. The hydroxyl-hydrogen and carbonyl-oxygen of THR-75 situated at the intracellular region are engaged in intra-residue hydrogen bonding. Thus , the hydroxyl-oxygens orient away from and the hydroxyl-hydrogens orient towards the center of the selectivity filter. Hence , this site attracts and acts as a ` gate ' for the incoming K + ion. The binding of K + ion is first observed with eight carbonyl-oxygens of THR-75 and VAL-76 ( S3 site). However , binding at this site breaks the intra-residue hydrogen bonding of THR-75 , which in turn reorients the hydroxyl-hydrogens away from the selectivity filter. Accordingly , binding of K + ion at this site prevents the instantaneous approach of another K + ion. Thus , VAL-76 acts as a ` hinge ' to open and close the ` gate '. The next amino acid , GLY-77 , shows low affinity towards K + ion , thus acting as a ` regulator '. TYR-78 situated at the extracellular region shows strong binding affinity towards K + ion , and thus assists in the transport of K + ion from the intracellular to the extracellular region. The release of K + ion to form hydrated K ( H2O) 8 + in the extracellular region is endothermic ( 4.9 kcal mol-1). Hence , the process of K + ion transport is likely to be kinetically controlled. Moreover , the highest binding energy of Na + is observed at the center of four carbonyl-oxygens of VAL-76 ( -68.8 kcal mol-1) , which is even higher than the highest binding energy of K + ion at S3 ( -63.9 kcal mol-1). Na + binding energy decreases from intracellular to extracellular region. Hence , intracellular Na + ion would block the passage of K + ion. The K + ion concentration is high in the intracellular region , and it moves from intracellular to extracellular region , while Na + ion concentration is high in the extracellular region , and it moves from extracellular to intracellular region. Thus , the selective transport of K +/ Na + ion in KcsA can be attributed to the competition between K + ion exit and Na + ion entry at the center of four carbonyl-oxygens of TYR-78.
