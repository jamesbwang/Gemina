  Explicit memory after anaesthesia has gained considerable attention because of its negative implications , while implicit memory , which is more elusive and lacks patients ' explicit recall , has received less attention and dedicated research. This is despite the likely impact of implicit memory on postoperative long-term well-being and behaviour. Given the scarcity of human data , fear conditioning in animals offers a reliable model of implicit learning , and importantly , one where we already have a good understanding of the underlying neural circuitry in awake conditions. Animal studies provide evidence that fear conditioning occurs under anaesthesia. The effects of different anaesthetics on memory are complex , with different drugs interacting at different stages of learning. Modulatory suppressive effects can be because of context , specific drugs , and dose dependency. In some cases , low doses of general anaesthetics can actually lead to a paradoxical opposite effect. The underlying mechanisms involve several neurotransmitter systems , acting mainly in the amygdala , hippocampus , and neocortex. Here , we review animal studies of aversive conditioning under anaesthesia , discuss the complex picture that arises , identify the gaps in knowledge that require further investigation , and highlight the potential translational relevance of the models.
