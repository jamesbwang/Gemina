  Although extensively studied for three decades , the molecular mechanisms that regulate the RAF/MEK/ERK kinase cascade remain ambiguous. Recent studies identified the dimerization of RAF as a key event in the activation of this cascade. Here , we show that in-frame deletions in the β3-αC loop activate ARAF as well as BRAF and other oncogenic kinases by enforcing homodimerization. By characterizing these RAF mutants , we find that ARAF has less allosteric and catalytic activity than the other two RAF isoforms , which arises from its non-canonical APE motif. Further , these RAF mutants exhibit a strong oncogenic potential , and a differential inhibitor resistance that correlates with their dimer affinity. Using these unique mutants , we demonstrate that active RAFs , including the BRAF ( V600E) mutant , phosphorylate MEK in a dimer-dependent manner. This study characterizes a special category of oncogenic kinase mutations , and elucidates the molecular basis that underlies the differential ability of RAF isoforms to stimulate MEK-ERK pathway. Further , this study reveals a unique catalytic feature of RAF family kinases that can be exploited to control their activities for cancer therapies.
