  Elderly is the main age group affected by acute kidney injury ( AKI). There are no studies that investigated the predictive properties of urinary ( u) NGAL as an AKI marker in septic elderly population. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of uNGAL as predictor of AKI diagnosis and prognosis in elderly septic patients admitted to ICUs. We prospectively studied elderly patients with sepsis<disease> admitted to ICUs from October 2014 to November 2015. Assessment of renal function was performed daily by serum creatinine and urine output. The level of uNGAL was performed within the first 48 hours of the diagnosis of sepsis<disease> ( NGAL1) and between 48 and 96 hours ( NGAL2). The results were presented using descriptive statistics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC-ROC) and
