  In the past decade , iron oxide nanoparticles ( IONPs) have attracted more and more attention for their excellent physicochemical properties and promising biomedical applications. In this review , we summarize and highlight recent progress in the design , synthesis , biocompatibility evaluation and magnetic theranostic applications of IONPs , with a special focus on cancer treatment. Firstly , we provide an overview of the controlling synthesis strategies for fabricating zero- , one- and three-dimensional IONPs with different shapes , sizes and structures. Then , the
