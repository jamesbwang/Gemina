  The effect of a brief analytical treatment interruption ( ATI) on the HIV-1 latent reservoir of individuals who initiate antiretroviral therapy ( ART) during chronic<disease> infection<disease> is unknown. We evaluated the impact of transient viremia on the latent reservoir in participants who underwent an ATI and at least 6 months of subsequent viral suppression in a clinical trial testing the effect of passive infusion of the broadly neutralizing Ab VRC01 during ATI. Measures of total HIV-1 DNA , cell-associated RNA , and infectious units per million cells ( IUPM) ( measured by quantitative viral outgrowth assay ( QVOA)) were not statistically different before or after ATI. Phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 env sequences from QVOA and proviral DNA demonstrated little change in the composition of the virus populations comprising the pre- and post-ATI reservoir. Expanded clones were common in both QVOA and proviral DNA sequences. The frequency of clonal populations differed significantly between QVOA viruses , proviral DNA sequences , and the viruses that reactivated in vivo. The results indicate that transient viremia from ATI does not substantially alter measures of the latent reservoir , that clonal expansion is prevalent within the latent reservoir , and that characterization of latent viruses that can reactivate in vivo remains challenging.
