  The broad use of social networking and user-generated content has increased the online footprint of many individuals. A generation of healthcare professionals have grown up with online search activities as part of their everyday lives. Sites like Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram have given the public new ways to share intimate details about their public and private lives and the lives of their friends and families. As a result , careproviders have the ability to find out more about their patients with just the tap of a key or the click of a mouse. This type of online searching for patient information is known as patient-targeted googling or PTG. This article provides an overview of the emergence of PTG , identifies the potential benefits and possible pitfalls of engaging in PTG , and explores current ethical frameworks that guide decisions about PTG. The article describes the development of a critical thinking tool developed by the Behavioral Health Ethics Committee at CHI Health , that can serve as a best-practice model for other hospitals and health systems. Called TTaPP ( Together Take a Pause and Ponder) , this tool is designed to help healthcare professionals across settings practice collaborative critical thinking skills as they consider the ethical questions of whether or not to engage in PTG. Finally , this article suggests areas for further study , including ways to prompt collaboration and appropriate documentation by maximizing electronic medical records systems , exploring the effectiveness of the TTaPP tool as a way to promote a culture of collaborative critical thinking practices , and the attitudes of patients and the public regarding PTG.
