  Peptides that exhibit enzymatic or hormonal activities are regulatory factors and desirable therapeutic drugs because of their high target specificity and minimal side effects. Unfortunately , these drugs are susceptible to enzymatic degradation , leading to their rapid elimination and thereby demanding frequent dosage. Structurally modified forms of some peptide drugs have shown enhanced pharmacokinetics , improving their oral bioavailability. Here , we discuss a novel glycomimetic approach to modify lysine residues in peptides. In a model system , the ε-amine of Ts-Lys-OMe was reductively alkylated with a glucose derivative to afford a dihydroxylated piperidine in place of the amine. A similar modification was applied to H-KPV-NH2 , a tripeptide derived from the α-melanocyte stimulating hormone ( α-MSH) reported to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Antimicrobial assays , under a variety of conditions , showed no activity for Ac-KPV-NH2 or the α- or ε-glycoalkylated analogs. Glycoalkylated peptides did , however , show stability toward proteolytic enzymes.
