  The present work proposes , for the first time , a study exclusively focused on the diversity of Pteridophytes in Togo.The study was based on fieldwork that resulted in 869 new collections gathered between 2013 and 2017 in the country and on yet existing herbarium specimens kept at the Herbaria of Lom√© and Paris. Thus , a total number of 1092 specimens collected throughout the country served as a basis for this work , to which were added the known , published occurrences of Pteridophytes for the country. At the end of this study , a total diversity of 134 species belonging to 53 genera and 25 families and 12 orders were recorded and documented for the country. It results in 73 newly cited species for Togolese flora , including 61 spontaneous species. Lycopodiopsida ( 18 species) and Polypodiopsida ( 116 species) classes are both represented. The Polypodiales order is the most represented with 97 species. The Pteridaceae and Aspleniaceae families are the most diverse with 24 and 22 species respectively. Finally , notes were provided on species distribution at national level.
