  Treatments for cancer in the lower pelvis often cause lasting effects on women 's sexual well-being. The purpose of this review is to describe interventions to improve sexual well-being in gynecologic , anal , or rectal cancer survivors. This review follows the PRISMA ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2009 checklist and guidelines. A literature search was conducted using PubMed , CINAHL Â® , PsycINFO , and Cochrane Library. Articles were original intervention research studies of women treated for gynecologic , anal , or rectal cancer and included sexual well-being outcomes. Study characteristics were extracted and compared in a table for analysis and synthesis. Of the 16 included studies , 1 focused on genitourinary rehabilitation , 12 focused on psychoeducational interventions , and 3 focused on combination interventions. Most interventions reported at least one positive sexual well-being outcome. Intervention format , delivery , dose , and outcome variables varied widely. Preliminary efficacy and feasibility of interventions are promising , but larger studies designed to discern optimal content , delivery format , dose , and timing are needed.
