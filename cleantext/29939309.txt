  Wheat ( Triticum ssp.) is one of the most important human food sources. However , this crop is very sensitive to temperature changes. Specifically , processes during wheat leaf , flower , and seed development and photosynthesis , which all contribute to the yield of this crop , are affected by high temperature. While this has to some extent been investigated on physiological , developmental , and molecular levels , very little is known about early signalling events associated with an increase in temperature. Phosphorylation-mediated signalling mechanisms , which are quick and dynamic , are associated with plant growth and development , also under abiotic stress conditions. Therefore , we probed the impact of a short-term and mild increase in temperature on the wheat leaf and spikelet phosphoproteome. In total , 3822 ( containing 5178 phosphosites) and 5581 phosphopeptides ( containing 7023 phosphosites) were identified in leaf and spikelet samples , respectively. Following statistical analysis , the resulting data set provides the scientific community with a first large-scale plant phosphoproteome under the control of higher ambient temperature. This community resource on the high temperature-mediated wheat phosphoproteome will be valuable for future studies. Our analyses also revealed a core set of common proteins between leaf and spikelet , suggesting some level of conserved regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore , we observed temperature-regulated interconversion of phosphoforms , which probably impacts protein activity.
