  We aimed to analyse the relationship between training load/intensity and different heart rate variability ( HRV) fatigue<symptom> patterns in 57 elite Nordic-skiers. 1063 HRV tests were performed during 5 years. R-R intervals were recorded in resting supine ( SU) and standing ( ST) positions. Heart rate , low ( LF) , high ( HF) frequency powers of HRV were determined. Training volume , training load ( TL , a.u.) according to ventilatory threshold 1 ( VT1) and VT2 were measured in zones I ≤ VT1; VT1 < II ≤ VT2; III > VT2 , IV for strength. TL was performed at 81.6 ± 3.5 % in zone I , 0.9 ± 0.9 % in zone II , 5.0 ± 3.6 % in zone III , 11.6 ± 6.3 % in zone IV. 172 HRV tests matched a fatigue<symptom> state and four HRV fatigue<symptom> patterns ( F) were statistically characterized as F ( HF-LF-) SU_ST for 121 tests , F ( LF+SULF- ST) for 18 tests , F ( HF-SUHF + ST) for 26 tests and F ( HF+SU) for 7 tests. The occurrence of fatigue<symptom> states increased substantially with the part of altitude training time ( r2 = 0.52 , p < 0.001). This study evidenced that there is no causal relationship between training load/intensity and HRV fatigue<symptom> patterns. Four fatigue-shifted HRV patterns were sorted. Altitude training periods appeared critical as they are likely to increase the overreaching risks.
