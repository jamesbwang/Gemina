  Medium-chain triglycerides ( MCT) are emerging as unique dietary supplements that are potentially relevant for the amelioration of brain<symptom> dysfunctions<symptom>. MCT are converted into ketones and free medium chain fatty acids that , in the brain , are highly effective energy sources to mitochondria and potentially less harmful than glucose metabolism to neurons. Given the recently established link between mitochondrial dysfunction and high anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> , we performed this study to investigate the effectiveness of an MCT-enriched diet to ameliorate anxiety<symptom>- and depression-related behaviors in rats. Male rats were distributed into groups , according to their anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze. Each group was given either MCT-supplemented diet or an isocaloric control diet for fifteen days. Starting from the eighth day of diet , rats were exposed to different behavioral tests. MCT-fed rats exhibited reduced anxiety-like behaviors and enhanced social competitiveness , while their coping responses in the forced swim test were not affected by the treatment. When evaluated at the end of the two-week MCT diet , mitochondrial respiration<symptom> was reduced in the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC) while unchanged in the nucleus accumbens. In the mPFC , enzymes related to glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation were also decreased by MCT diet , while proteins controlling glucose and glutamate transport were increased. Altogether , our findings strongly suggest the effectiveness of MCT diet to exert anxiolytic effects. In the brain , our results point to the mPFC as a brain region in which MCT supplementation improves transport and control of energy substrates.
