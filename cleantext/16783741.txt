  Bone replacement might have been practiced for centuries with various materials of natural origin , but had rarely met success until the late 19th century. Nowadays , many different bone substitutes can be used. They can be either derived from biological products such as demineralized bone matrix , platelet-rich plasma , hydroxyapatite , adjunction of growth factors ( like bone morphogenetic protein) or synthetic such as calcium sulfate , tri-calcium phosphate ceramics , bioactive glasses , or polymer-based substitutes. All these substitutes are not suitable for every clinical use , and they have to be chosen selectively depending on their purpose. Thus , this review aims to highlight the principal characteristics of the most commonly used bone substitutes and to give some directions concerning their clinical use , as spine fusion , open-wedge tibial osteotomy , long bone fracture , oral and maxillofacial surgery , or periodontal treatments. However , the main limitations to bone substitutes use remain the management of large defects and the lack of vascularization in their central part , which is likely to appear following their utilization. In the field of bone tissue engineering , developing porous synthetic substitutes able to support a faster and a wider vascularization within their structure seems to be a promising way of research.
