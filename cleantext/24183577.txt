  Intramammary metastasis of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) is extremely rare , accounting for only 1.5 % of all intramammary metastases. Distinguishing intramammary metastases from benign tumors and breast cancer is clinically problematic. Some patients undergo excessive surgery after a misdiagnosis of breast cancer instead of a mammary tumor. We performed a core needle biopsy ( CNB) of a breast mass that developed in a 71-year-old woman after surgeries for bilateral RCC and breast cancer , leading to a diagnosis of intramammary metastasis of RCC. In this case , the CNB and immunohistochemical examination were critical for reaching a definitive diagnosis. We conclude that , when examining patients with mammary tumors , establishing their history of malignant tumors may help diagnose intramammary metastasis and select the best treatment strategy.
