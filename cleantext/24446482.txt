  African trypanosomes , Trypanosoma brucei spp. , are lethal pathogens that cause substantial human suffering and limit economic development in some of the world 's most impoverished regions. The name Trypanosoma ( `` auger cell '') derives from the parasite 's distinctive motility , which is driven by a single flagellum. However , despite decades of study , a requirement for trypanosome motility in mammalian host infection has not been established. LC1 is a conserved dynein subunit required for flagellar motility. Prior studies with a conditional RNAi-based LC1 mutant , RNAi-K/R , revealed that parasites with defective motility could infect mice. However , RNAi-K/R retained residual expression of wild-type LC1 and residual motility , thus precluding definitive interpretation. To overcome these limitations , here we generate constitutive mutants in which both LC1 alleles are replaced with mutant versions. These double knock-in mutants show reduced motility compared to RNAi-K/R and are viable in culture , but are unable to maintain bloodstream infection in mice. The virulence defect is independent of infection route but dependent on an intact host immune system. By comparing different mutants , we also reveal a critical dependence on the LC1 N-terminus for motility and virulence. Our findings demonstrate that trypanosome motility is critical for establishment and maintenance of bloodstream infection , implicating dynein-dependent flagellar motility as a potential drug target.
