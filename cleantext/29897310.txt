  Microvascular injury is an important factor in renal allograft survival. Repeated episodes of endothelial injury from chronic antibody-mediated rejection typically manifest at the ultrastructural level as circumferential multilayering of remodeled glomerular basement membrane material and peritubular capillary basal lamina. In contrast to this typical pattern of microvascular injury , a renal transplantation case is presented in which focally dilated and multilayered segments of peritubular capillary basal lamina bearing lipid droplets were interspersed with ultrastructurally normal unilayered segments of basal lamina devoid of lipid droplets. Glomerular basement membranes<symptom> were not affected by this process. The peak incidence of lipid droplets within the peritubular capillary walls coincided with a peak in apoptotic activity within the allograft. Lesser amounts of the same lipidic material were identified in the mesangial matrix and an arteriolar wall. Mesangial electron-dense deposits were detected at two weeks posttransplantation and their appearance coincided with elevated immunological activity in the glomeruli , as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. The unusual ultrastructure and immunological activity observed in this case may reflect a process of impaired apoptotic clearance within the allograft. The six biopsies from a single patient are discussed in the setting of a highly sensitized renal transplant recipient who received prophylactic terminal complement blockade by eculizumab. The findings may be relevant to the study of apoptosis , efferocytosis , microvascular injury , eculizumab , rejection , lupus , and drug-related disease.
