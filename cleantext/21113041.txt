  Based on a panel of 30 provinces and a timeframe from January 2009 to December 2013 , we estimate the association between monthly human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome<disease> ( HIV/AIDS) incidence and the relevant Internet search query volumes in Baidu , the most widely used search engine among the Chinese. The pooled mean group ( PMG) model show that the Baidu search index ( BSI) positively predicts the increase in HIV/AIDS incidence , with a 1 % increase in BSI associated with a 2.1 % increase in HIV/AIDS incidence on average. This study proposes a promising method to estimate and forecast the incidence of HIV/AIDS , a type of infectious<disease> disease<disease> that is culturally sensitive and highly unevenly distributed in China; the method can be taken as a complement to a traditional HIV/AIDS surveillance system.
