  The purpose of this study was to correlate the pattern of spread with oncological outcomes in advanced ovarian cancer patients. This is a retrospective analysis of 55 consecutive patients who had advanced epithelial ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal carcinomatosis ( stages 3C and 4) with primary surgical intervention as the initial modality of treatment. Based on the spread of disease , they were further classified into class A: disease confined to the pelvis ( excluded); class B: disease extending to the lower abdomen and omentum; class C: diffuse small-bowel disease with or without A , B , or D; and class D: disease in the upper abdomen. There were 17 patients ( 30.9 %) in class B , 17 ( 30.9 %) in class C , and 21 ( 38.2 %) in class D. The number of patients with suboptimal cytoreduction was highest in class C ( six patients). At the end of follow-up ( median 38.6 months) , 16 patients had no evidence of disease and 26 patients were alive with disease. The 3-year overall survival rates in classes B , C , and D were 94.1 , 52.5 , and 93.3 % , respectively. The 3-year progression-free survival rates were 55.8 , 11.8 , and 41.9 % , respectively. The rates were lowest for class C. The differences in the overall survival rate (
