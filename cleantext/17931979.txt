  This narrative review critically evaluated the published studies regarding the systematic use of antiplatelet agents for secondary stroke prevention. Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Multimodal prevention is the most viable strategy for reducing the societal burden of stroke recurrence. For secondary stroke prevention , antiplatelet therapy is at the core of effective long-term vascular risk reduction among survivors of an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack ( TIA). In addition to aspirin , there are several antiplatelet agents proven to be efficacious in averting recurrent vascular events after an index ischemic stroke or TIA. However , beyond the challenges of keeping up with recent advances in antiplatelet drug options for secondary stroke prevention , questions linger about the most appropriate selection , timing , and dosing of antiplatelet treatment for a given patient. We narratively summarized the pharmacological properties of key antiplatelet drugs; discussed the evidence regarding efficacy , selection , timing , and dosing of various antiplatelet treatment regimens; and highlighted ongoing clinical trials identifying novel therapies with more favorable risk-benefit profiles than currently available antiplatelet agents for patients with a recent history of ischemic or TIA stroke. Finally , we reviewed published data on antiplatelet therapies that could potentially be applied in the management of commonly encountered challenging clinical scenarios.
