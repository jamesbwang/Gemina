  In this contribution , a fault-tolerant control strategy for the longitudinal dynamics of an autonomous vehicle is presented. The aim is to be able to detect potential failures of the vehicle 's speed sensor and then to keep the vehicle in a safe state. For this purpose , the separation principle , composed of a static output feedback controller and fault estimation observers , is designed. Indeed , two observer techniques were proposed: the proportional and integral observer and the descriptor observer. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by means of the experimental demonstrator of the VEDECOM ( Véhicle Décarboné et Communinicant) Institut.
