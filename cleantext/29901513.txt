  Every year more than one million people worldwide undergo an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP) for disorders of the bile duct system. This review aims to discuss recent clinical data with regard to single-operator peroral cholangioscopy ( POC). Innovations and technical optimizations of POC devices have extended diagnostic and therapeutic options for patients with complex biliary disease. Most of the currently available clinically relevant data are obtained with the single-operator peroral cholangioscopy ( SOC)- system SpyGlass , which in a period of a decade has evolved further to a digital platform with increasing applicability , usefulness and cost-effectiveness. POC allows endoscopists to treat patients with complicated diseases of the gallbladder , liver , biliary tract , and pancreas better. In recent years , this technique was optimized to overcome prior limitations. The implementation of the single-operator SpyGlass Digital System in daily practice becomes a reality. We make an overview of the history of cholangioscopy , the technical evolution , and usefulness of this platform and take a look at its economic impact.
