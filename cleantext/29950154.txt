  In February 2018 , the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Janus v. AFSCME , a case poised to make right-to-work ( or , as some call it , right-to-work-for-less) the law in the public sector. At issue is the constitutionality of requiring non-union members , who benefit from collective bargaining , to pay fees that support contract negotiations on the terms and conditions of their employment. We argue that a win for Janus would threaten public health by eroding organized labor 's power to improve working conditions. Furthermore , we critique the dubious legal theory underpinning Janus 's case and describe the moneyed political interests backing his legal representation. Finally , we chart a path forward for labor organizing in a post- Janus world , drawing inspiration from the winter 2018 educators ' strike in West Virginia. Regardless of how Janus itself is decided , the issues raised in this article remain crucial because the ongoing weakening of unions by legislative and judicial means undermines workers ' health and exacerbates inequities.
