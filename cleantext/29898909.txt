  Endoscopic removal of eroded Lap-Bands is a minimally invasive alternative to surgical removal that prerequires sufficient erosion through the gastric wall , that is , ≥ 180 ° of the gastro-oesophageal wall circumference. A 69-year-old woman presented with dysphagia<symptom> due to a long-standing Lap-Band erosion , currently of a 60 ° circumference. Adhesions due to her extensive surgical history rendered surgical treatment undesirable , so a self-expanding stent was placed endoscopically to induce sufficient erosion for subsequent endoscopic removal. During therapy , the patient complained of ructus and dysphagia<symptom> , probably related to an overly proximally ( oesophageal) positioned stent. After a total of 12 weeks , far longer than the described stenting duration in the literature , the Lap-Band was found free in the gastric lumen and was successfully removed using an endoscopic loop. Stent-induced compression necrosis<symptom> should be considered as a minimally invasive treatment option for Lap-Bands eroded for < 180 ° , with caution in the context of extensive
