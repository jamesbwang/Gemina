  Cell-based therapies for acute and chronic liver diseases are under continuous progress. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells ( MSCs) are multipotent cells able to migrate selectively to damaged tissue and contribute to its healing and regeneration. The MSC pro-regenerative effect occurs due to their immunomodulatory capacity and their ability to produce factors that promote cell protection and survival. Likewise , it has been observed that part of their paracrine effect is mediated by MSC-derived extracellular vesicles ( EVs). EVs contain proteins , lipids and nucleic acids ( DNA , mRNA , miRNA , lncRNA) from the cell of origin , allowing for intercellular communication. Recently , different studies have demonstrated that MSC-derived EVs could reproduce , at least in part , the biological effects obtained by MSC-based therapies. Moreover , due to EVs ' stability for long periods of time and easy isolation methods they have become a therapeutic option to MSCs treatments. This review summarizes the latest results achieved in clinical trials using MSCs as cell therapy for liver regeneration , the role of EVs in liver physiopathology and the potential of MSCderived EVs as intercellular mediators and therapeutic tools in liver diseases.
