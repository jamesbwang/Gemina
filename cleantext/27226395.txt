  Hypothyroxinemia ( Hpx) is a thyroid hormone deficiency ( THD) condition highly frequent during pregnancy , which although asymptomatic for the mother , it can impair the cognitive function of the offspring. Previous studies have shown that maternal hypothyroidism increases the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis<disease> ( EAE) , an autoimmune disease model for multiple sclerosis ( MS). Here , we analyzed the immune response after EAE induction in the adult offspring gestated in Hpx. Mice gestated in Hpx showed an early appearance of EAE symptoms and the increase of all parameters of the disease such as: the pathological score , spinal cord demyelination , and immune cell infiltration in comparison to the adult offspring gestated in euthyroidism.
