Short-term plyometric jump training improves repeated-sprint ability in prepuberal male soccer players. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-This study examined the effects of a short-term ( i.e. , 8 weeks) combined horizontal and vertical plyometric jump training ( PJT) program in combination with regular soccer-specific training as compared with soccer-specific training only on jump and change of direction ( CoD) performances , speed , and repeated-sprint ability ( RSA<pathogen>) in prepuberal male soccer players. Twenty-four players were recruited and randomly assigned to either a PJT group ( PJTG; n = 13; 12.7 ± 0.2 years) or an active control group ( CONG; n = 11; 12.7 ± 0.2 years). The outcome measures included tests for the assessment of jump performance ( drop jump from 20- to 40-cm height ( DJ20 and DJ40) and 3-hop test ( THT)) , speed ( 20-m sprint) , CoD ( T-test) , and RSA<pathogen> ( 20-m repeated shuttle sprint). Data were analyzed using magnitude-based inferences. Within-group analyses revealed large performance improvements in the T-test ( d = -1.2) , DJ20 ( d = 3.7) , DJ40 ( d = 3.6) , THT ( d = 0.6) , and the RSAtotal ( d = -1.6) in the PJTG. Between-group analyses showed greater performance improvements in the T-test ( d = -2.9) , 20-m sprint time ( d = -2.0) , DJ20 ( d = 2.4) , DJ40 ( d = 2.0) , THT ( d = 1.9) , RSAbest ( d = -1.9) , and the RSAtotal ( d = -1.9) in the PJTG compared with CONG. Eight weeks of an in-season PJT in addition to regular soccer-specific training induced larger increases in measures of physical fitness in prepuberal male soccer players compared with regular soccer-specific training only. More specifically , PJT was effective in improving RSA<pathogen> performance.
