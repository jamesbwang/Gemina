  The term orthodisease defines human disorders in which the pathogenic gene has orthologs in model organism genomes. Yeasts have been instrumental for gaining insights into the molecular basis of many human disorders , particularly those resulting from impaired cellular metabolism. We and others have used yeasts as a model system to study the molecular basis of Hailey-Hailey disease ( HHD) , a human blistering skin disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of the gene
