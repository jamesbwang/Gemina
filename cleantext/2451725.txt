  Dopamine controls various physiological functions in the brain and periphery by acting on its receptors D1 , D2 , D3 , D4 , and D5. Dopamine receptors are G protein-coupled receptors involved in the regulation of motor activity and several neurological disorders such as schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , Parkinson 's disease ( PD) , Alzheimer 's disease , and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Reduction in dopamine content in the nigrostriatal pathway is associated with the development of PD , along with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region. Dopamine receptors directly regulate neurotransmission of other neurotransmitters , release of cyclic adenosine monophosphate , cell proliferation , and differentiation. Here , we provide an update on recent knowledge about the signalling mechanism , mode of action , and the evidence for the physiological and functional basis of dopamine receptors. We also highlight the pivotal role of these receptors in the modulation of neurogenesis , a possible therapeutic target that might help to slow down the process of neurodegeneration.
