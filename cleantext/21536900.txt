  The emergence of food production during the earliest Neolithic of the Near East was accompanied by profound changes in the ways in which societies were organized. Elaborate and multi-stage mortuary practices involving the removal , caching , and plastering of symbolically charged skulls are thought to have played an important role in cross-cutting household lines to integrate communities and maintain social cohesion during the late tenth to ninth millennium cal BP , particularly in Middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B settlements located in the southern Levant. While the ritual and mortuary activities associated with skull manipulation were dramatic and high impact occasions that drew people and households together , it is likely they were highly episodic and , consequently , attendant community cohesion susceptible to decay over time. Recent research in southern Jordan , where skull plastering was not practiced as seen elsewhere in the southern Levant , has revealed that non-residential building structures were a common feature of early Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlements. Renewed excavations at Beidha , a Middle PPNB settlement located in the Shara'a mountains , have revealed a large , easily accessible communal structure that provided a focal point in which mundane , informal daily activities could regularly take place. The routine and repeated interactions fostered by such non-domestic structures facilitated highly durable modes of community cohesion and was part of a temporally deep ethos of community that first emerged a thousand years earlier when people first began to experiment with plant cultivation. It appears that in southern Jordan , a distinctive social cohesion pathway developed that engaged community daily practice within non-residential buildings to maintain and strengthen social structures , rather than occasional and dramatic ritual and mortuary practices used elsewhere in the southern Levant.
