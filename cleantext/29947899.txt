  For the analysis of drugs and pharmaceutical compounds in biological matrices , extraction procedures are typically used for LC-MS/MS analysis often requiring manual steps in sample preparation. In this study , we report a fully automated extraction method carried out by a programable liquid handler directly coupled to an LC-MS/MS system for the determination of 42 components ( illicit drugs and/or metabolites) ( plus 20 deuterated internal standards). The acquisition was performed in positive ionization mode with up to 15 MRM transitions per compound , each with optimized collision energy ( MRM spectrum mode) to enable qualitative library searching in addition to quantitation. After placing the sample tube into the system , no further intervention was necessary: automated preparation used 50 μL of blood or plasma with 3 μL of extracted sample injected for analysis. The method was validated according to the requirements of ISO 15189. The limit of detection and quantification was 1-5 ng/mL depending on the compound. Stability experiments found that historic calibration curve data files could accurately quantify for up to 1 month with less than 20 % uncertainty. Comparison to a QuEChERS method was made using patient samples providing a regression correlation R
