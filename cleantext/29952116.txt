  Radiotherapy is an important modality for treatment of carcinomas; however , radio-resistance is still a difficult problem. Aberrant epigenetic alterations play an important role in cancer development. Among epigenetic parameters , DNA methylation has arguably attracted the most attention in the radio-resistance process. To determine the role of DNA methylation in radiation resistance , several studies were conducted. We summarized previous studies on the role of DNA methylation in radiotherapy. We observed this significant role of DNA methylation in genes related to DNA repair , cell proliferation , cell cycle process , and re-oxygenation. Furtherly , we also conclude the predictive effect of DNA methylation on tumor radio-sensitivity and the using of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in clinical practice. DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in the radio-sensitivity of tumor radio-therapy. While hyper-methylation or hypo-methylation of genes is related to gene functions.
