  An effective method of combating infectious<disease> diseases<disease> is the deployment of hand-held devices at the point-of-care ( POC) for screening or self-monitoring applications. There is a need for very sensitive , low-cost and quantitative diagnostic devices. In this study , we present a low-cost , multiplexed fluorescence detection platform that has a high sensitivity and wide dynamic range. Our system features inexpensive 3 × 3 mm interference filters with a high stopband rejection , sharp transition edges , and greater than 90 % transmission in the passband. In addition to the filters , we improve signal-to-noise ratio by leveraging time for accuracy using a charge-integration-based readout. The fluorescence sensing platform provides a sensitivity to photon flux of ∼ 1 × 10
