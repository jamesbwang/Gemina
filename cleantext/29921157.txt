  Phase II clinical trials are concerned with making decision of whether a treatment is sufficiently efficacious to be worth further investigations in late large scale Phase III trials. In oncology Phase II trials , frequentist single-arm two-stage group-sequential designs with a binary endpoint are commonly used. To allow for more flexibility , adaptive versions of these designs have been proposed. In this paper , we propose point and interval estimation for adaptive designs in which the second stage sample size is a pre-specified function of first stage 's number of responses. Our approach is based on sample space orderings , from which we derive p-values , and point and interval estimates. Simulation studies show that our proposed methods perform better , in terms of bias and root mean square error , than the fixed-sample maximum likelihood estimator.
