  Little evidence exists on the burden that chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) poses specifically to patients in China. The objective of this study , therefore , was to describe the burden of HF on patients in China. A cross-sectional survey of cardiologists and their patients with HF was conducted. Patient record forms were completed by 150 cardiologists for 10 consecutive patients. Patients for whom a patient record form was completed were invited to complete a patient questionnaire. Most of the 933 patients ( mean ( SD) age 65.8 ( 10.2) years; 55 % male; 80 % retired) included in the study received care in tier 2 and 3 hospitals in large cities. Patients gave a median score of 4 on a scale from 1 ( no disruption) to 10 ( severe disruption) to describe how much HF disrupts their everyday life. Patients in paid employment ( 8 %) missed 10 % of work time and experienced 29 % impairment in their ability to work due to HF in the previous week. All aspects of patients ' health-related quality of life ( QoL) were negatively affected by their condition. Mean ± SD utility calculated by the 3-level 5-dimension EuroQol questionnaire was 0.8 ± 0.2 , and patients rated their health at 70.3 ( 11.5) on a 100 mm visual analog scale. Patients incurred costs associated with HF treatment , travel , and professional caregiving services. HF is associated with poor health-related QoL and considerable disruption in patients ' lives. Novel and improved therapies are needed to reduce the burden of HF on patients and the health care system.
