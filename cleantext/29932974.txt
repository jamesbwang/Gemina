  The major yolk protein precursors ( YPP) gene , vitellogenin ( Vg) , usually considered as a reproductive indicator and molecular marker for evaluating insect fecundity , is controlled by insect hormone ( mainly ecdysteroids and juvenile hormone) , transcription factors and many other fecundity-related genes. To better understand the underlying molecular regulation mechanisms of the NlVg in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens ( N. lugens) , the correlation between one early ecdysone response gene E74 and one important fecundity-related gene angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE) on the regulation of Vg gene expression , was investigated. We first showed that the mRNA expression level of NlACE were significantly higher in a high-fecundity population ( HFP) than a low-fecundity population ( LFP) at different development stages , and knockdown of NlACE expression by RNA interference ( RNAi) results in a reduced level of NlVg expression and N. lugens fecundity. Subsequently , we analyzed the promoter of NlACE and found an E74A binding site , which was also differentially expressed in HFP and LFP. Then a gene putatively encoding E74A , namely NlE74A , predominant in the ovary and fat body was cloned and characterized. Furthermore , the developmental profile during female adult and the tissue-specific expression pattern of NlACE and NlE74A were similar to the expression pattern of NlVg gene , implying that both NlACE and NlE74A may be involved in regulating the expression of NlVg. Finally , after injecting the dsRNA of NlE74A , the NlACE expression levels were significantly reduced simultaneously at 24 h and 48 h post-injection , and the NlVg expression level was significant reduced at 24 h post-injection and the downswing was more significant at 48 h post-injection. These results imply that regulation of NlE74A on NlVg transcription might be mediated by NlACE through the E74 binding site at the NlACE promoter region in N. lugens.
