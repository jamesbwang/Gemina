  Strong reciprocity explains prosocial cooperation by the presence of individuals who incur costs to help those who helped them ( ` strong positive reciprocity ') and to punish those who wronged them ( ` strong negative reciprocity '). Theories of social preferences predict that in contrast to ` strong reciprocators ' , self-regarding people cooperate and punish only if there are sufficient future benefits. Here , we test this prediction in a two-stage design. First , participants are classified according to their disposition towards strong positive reciprocity as either dispositional conditional cooperators ( DCC) or dispositional free riders ( DFR). Participants then play a one-shot public goods game , either with or without punishment. As expected , DFR cooperate only when punishment is possible , whereas DCC cooperate without punishment. Surprisingly , dispositions towards strong positive reciprocity are unrelated to strong negative reciprocity: punishment by DCC and DFR is practically identical. The ` burden of cooperation ' is thus carried by a larger set of individuals than previously assumed.
