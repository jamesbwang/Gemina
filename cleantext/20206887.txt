  Fever<disease> of unknown origin ( FUO) is a frequently observed phenomenon in clinical practice. The present study was aimed to investigate potential causes of FUO , thereby improving clinical diagnosis of this disorder.In this retrospective study , clinical data were collected from 215 patients who were diagnosed with FUO between January 2009 and December 2010 , and an 18 to 36 months follow-up visit was also performed for these patients.Among these FUO cases , the most common causes of the disease were infectious<disease> diseases<disease> ( IDs) ( 42.3 %) , followed by connective tissue diseases ( CTDs) ( 32.1 %) , miscellaneous ( Mi) ( 10.7 %) and neoplasm ( N) ( 6.5 %) , while the causes for the other 18 cases ( 8.4 %) were still unknown. The most common types of ID , CTD , and N were tuberculosis<disease> ( 16/91 , 17.6 %) , adult onset Still disease ( AOSD) ( 37/69 , 53.6 %) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( 6/14 , 42.9 %) , respectively.IDs still represent the most common causes of FUO. Regularly intermittent fever<disease> with urinary<disease> infections<disease> and irregularly intermittent fever<disease> with infective endocarditis<disease> may be regarded as some signs in clinical diagnosis of FUO.
