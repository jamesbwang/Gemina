  Twenty-four-hour urine phosphorus is commonly used as a surrogate measure for phosphorus intake and absorption in research studies , but its reliability and accuracy are unproven in health or CKD. This secondary analysis sought to determine the reliability and accuracy of 24-hour urine phosphorus as a biomarker of phosphorus intake and absorption in moderate CKD. Eight patients with stage 3-4 CKD participated in 2-week balance<symptom> studies with tightly controlled phosphorus and calcium intakes. Thirteen 24-hour urine collections per patient were analyzed for variability and reliability of 24-hour urine phosphorus and phosphorus-to-creatinine ratio. The accuracy of 24-hour urine phosphorus to predict phosphorus intake was determined using a published equation. The relationships of 24-hour urine phosphorus with phosphorus intake , net absorption , and retention were determined. There was wide day-to-day variation in 24-hour urine phosphorus within and among subjects ( coefficient of variation of 30 % and 37 % , respectively). Two 24-hour urine measures were needed to achieve â‰¥ 75 % reliability. Estimating dietary phosphorus intake from a single 24-hour urine resulted in underestimation up to 98 % in some patients and overestimation up to 79 % in others. Twenty-four-hour urine phosphorus negatively correlated with whole-body retention but was not related to net absorption. From a sample of eight patients with moderate CKD on a tightly controlled dietary intake , 24-hour urine phosphorus was highly variable and did not relate to dietary phosphorus intake or absorption , rather it inversely related to phosphorus retention.
