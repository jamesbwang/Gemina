  This study aims to establish parameters for identifying normal function for each of the 3 iterations of balloon-expandable valves and 2 iterations of self-expanding valves. Expected transthoracic echocardiographic Doppler-derived hemodynamic data for transcatheter aortic valves inform pre-implant decision-making and post-implanted monitoring of longitudinal valve function. We collected the Echocardiography Core Lab measured mean gradients and effective orifice area ( EOA) from discharge or 30-day echocardiograms from randomized trials; the PARTNER ( Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) trials for the balloon-expandable valves and the Medtronic CoreValve US Pivotal trial and Medtronic CoreValve Evolut R United States IDE Clinical Study for the self-expanding valves. For all SAPIEN ( Edwards Lifesciences , Irvine , California) valve sizes , mean EOA = 1.70 Â± 0.49 cm Tables of expected mean transcatheter aortic valve hemodynamics by valve type and size are essential in evaluating the function of these transcatheter prosthetic valves. Tables of expected EOA by the native annular anatomy may be useful for pre-implantation decision making. Criteria for defining structural valve dysfunction are proposed.
