  Lanthanide ions accelerate nuclear spin relaxation by two primary mechanisms: dipolar and Curie. Both are commonly assumed to depend on the length of the lanthanide-nucleus vector , but not on its direction. Here we show experimentally that this is wrong- careful proton relaxation data analysis in a series of isostructural lanthanide complexes ( Ln = Tb , Dy , Ho , Er , Tm , Yb) reveals angular dependence in both Curie and dipolar relaxation. The reasons are: ( a) that magnetic susceptibility anisotropy can be of the same order of magnitude as the isotropic part ( contradicting the unstated assumption in Gu√©ron 's theory of the Curie relaxation process) , and ( b) that zero-field splitting can be much stronger than the electron Zeeman interaction ( Bloembergen 's original theory of the lanthanide-induced dipolar relaxation process makes the opposite assumption). These factors go beyond the well researched cross-correlation effects; they alter the relaxation theory treatment and make strong angular dependencies appear in the nuclear spin relaxation rates. Those dependencies are impossible to ignore- this is now demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally , and suggests that a major revision is needed of the way lanthanide-induced relaxation data are used in structural biology.
