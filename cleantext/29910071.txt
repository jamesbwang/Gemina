  Pancreatic trauma management hinges upon the presence or absence of pancreatic duct injury , but the optimal method of assessment is unclear. This study endeavored to evaluate the methods of pancreatic duct assessment in modern practice. Patients presenting to LAC + USC Medical Center ( 01/2008 - 06/2015) with a pancreatic injury were identified ( ICD-9 codes). Demographics , clinical data , technique of duct evaluation , and outcomes were analyzed. 71 patients with pancreatic injury were identified. 21 patients ( 30 %) underwent CT scan ( sensitivity 76 %). Sixteen ( 76 %) then underwent laparotomy while 5 ( 24 %) were managed successfully nonoperatively. Most ( n = 50 , 70 %) underwent immediate laparotomy. Overall , 66 patients ( 93 %) were managed operatively. The majority were assessed intraoperatively for ductal injury with visual inspection alone ( n = 62 , 94 %). Four ( 6 %) underwent intraoperative pancreatography via duodenotomy/cholecystotomy , which were all inconclusive. In the evaluation of pancreatic duct injury , intraoperative pancreatography is frequently inconclusive and should have a limited role. Clinical suspicion for ductal injury based on intraoperative visual inspection alone should guide the management of pancreatic injuries.
