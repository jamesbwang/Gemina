  To investigate contamination levels of 10 mycotoxins in human breast milk from 15 provinces in China. The human milk breast samples were collected from 15 provinces in China by aid of the second National Breast Milk Survey. After the pooled samples were made , concentrations of 10 main mycotoxins in breast milk pooled samples were measured by a UPLC-MS/MS with isotope dilution. aflatoxins B_1 , aflatoxins M_1 , deoxynivalenol , deepoxydeoxynivalenol , fumonisin B1 and fumonisin B2 were detected in breast milk samples of some provinces , while zearalenone , α-zearalenol , β-zearalenol and ochratoxin A were not detected in all the samples. The average load levels in human body of mycotoxins in human milk form Chinese general populations are relatively low. However , the effects of aflatoxins , deoxynivalenol and fumonisins on health risks for the baby should be paid attention.
