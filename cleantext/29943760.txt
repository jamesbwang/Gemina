  Primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders include a spectrum of inflammatory<disease> chronic<disease> diseases<disease> in which eosinophils infiltrate the gut in the absence of known causes of such tissue eosinophilia. They may affect any area of the gastrointestinal tract although exclusive colonic disease is exceptional. Due to their low prevalence these disorders are not usually taken into account when making a differential diagnosis in a patient with chronic diarrhea<disease> , which is the reason why in many cases the diagnosis can take many years. We describe the case of a patient with well-controlled celiac disease and chronic diarrhea<disease> of indeterminate origin. The final diagnosis was eosinophilic colitis<disease>. A complete response was obtained when she was treated with oral budesonide. Nowadays she remains asymptomatic.
