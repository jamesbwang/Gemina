  Plant extracts can be obtained to carry bioactive compounds , useful for prevention and treatment of different illnesses. This also supports the intake of teas as functional beverages. Nonetheless , it is incompletely known whether these extracts can act as effective sources and vehicles de phenolic compounds ( phenolics/polyphenols) to reach their targets. To establish whether phytoextract ingestion modified in a sex-dependent manner the phenolic bioavailability and redox response in liver and kidney. BALB/C mice ingested for a month 100 mg/Kg/d of extracts ( tea-like) from Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco ( AQB) , Lantana grisebachii ( LG) or Ilex paraguariensis ( IP). Then , phenolics , peroxides and nitrites were analyzed by spectrophotometry. Also , phenolic permeation from digested and undigested extracts was evaluated in vitro with a rat jejunum-based assay. Phenolic permeation depended on extract digestion. In males , IP showed a special time course of hepatic phenolics , whereas all extracts decreased renal phenolics at 15 days. Extracts induced hepatic lipoperoxides at 15 days. LG reduced renal hydroperoxides at 15 days and hepatic nitrites at 30 days , whereas AQB and IP reduced renal lipoperoxides and nitrites at 30 days. In females , extracts reduced hydroperoxides , with LG and AQB also reducing lipoperoxides. IP increased renal lipoperoxides at 30 days. IP was a relevant phenolic source. Sex-dependent responses were found in all variables , which should be considered to prevent misleading generalizations in phytodrug bioprospecting.
