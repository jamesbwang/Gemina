  A PVP-assisted pyrolysis strategy that can simply but efficiently transform zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 ( ZIF-67) into a Co-embedded N-enriched meso/microporous carbon material ( Co-NC) is reported for the first time. Without further acid treatment , Co-NC can reach an excellent electroactivity and long-term durability toward the oxygen-reduction reaction ( ORR) and the oxygen-evolution reaction ( OER).
