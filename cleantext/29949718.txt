  Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS) have identified common variants associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). Whole-genome sequencing ( WGS) offers comprehensive coverage of the entire genome compared with genotyping arrays or exome sequencing. We hypothesized that WGS in subjects with severe COPD and smoking controls with normal pulmonary function would allow us to identify novel genetic determinants of COPD. We sequenced 821 severe COPD cases and 973 controls from the COPDGene and Boston Early-Onset COPD studies , including both non-Hispanic white ( NHW) and African Americans ( AA). We performed single-variant and grouped-variant analyses , and additionally assessed the overlap of variants between sequencing and array-based imputation. Our most associated variant was in a known region near HHIP ( combined p = 1.6x10-9); additional variants approaching genome-wide significance included previously described regions in CHRNA5 , TNS1 , and SERPINA6/SERPINA1. None of our associations were clearly driven by rare variants , and we found minimal evidence of replication of genes identified by previously reported smaller sequencing studies. With WGS we identified > 20 million new variants , not seen with imputation , including > 10,000 of potential importance in previously identified COPD GWAS regions. Whole-genome sequencing in severe COPD identifies a large number of potentially important functional variants , with the strongest associations being in known COPD risk loci , including HHIP and SERPINA1 ( AA). Larger sample sizes will be needed to identify associated variants in novel regions of the genome.
