  Periodontitis<disease> was reported to be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) , and both diseases are related to smoking. To identify associations between periodontitis<disease> , smoking , and COPD , this cross-sectional study enrolled 1474 Japanese men ( mean age 55.2 ± 8.9 years) surveyed between 2003 and 2006. Periodontal status was evaluated by using the community periodontal index. Periodontitis<disease> was defined as the presence of at least one sextant with a pocket depth ≥ 4 mm. Lung function was measured by spirometry , and COPD was defined as ratio of forced expiratory volume after 1 second to forced vital capacity of < 0.70. Logistic regression analysis showed that the association between COPD and smoking was stronger for men with periodontitis<disease> ( odds ratio 2.45; 95 % confidence interval 1.37-4.37) than for those without periodontitis<disease> ( odds ratio 1.64; 95 % confidence interval 0.91-2.94) , after adjusting for age , number of present teeth , body mass index , alcohol intake , occupation , hypertension , and diabetes. The association between smoking and COPD was significant for men with periodontitis<disease> but was weaker for those without periodontitis<disease> These findings suggest that periodontitis<disease> modifies the association between smoking and COPD.
