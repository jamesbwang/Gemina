  Some assemblies of nanomaterials , like carbon nanotube ( CNT) sheet or film , always show outstanding and anisotropic thermal properties. However , there is still a lack of comprehensive thermal conductivity ( κ) characterizations on CNT sheets , as well as a lack of estimations of their true contributions on thermal enhancement of polymer composites when used as additives. Always , these characterizations were hindered by the low heat capacity , anisotropic thermal properties or low electrical conductivity of assemblies and their nanocomposites. The transient κ measurement and calculations were also hampered by accurate determination of parameters , like specific heat capacity , density and cross-section , which could be difficult and controversial for nanomaterials , like CNT sheets. Here , to measure anisotropic κ of CNT sheets directly with high fidelity , we modified the conventional steady-state method by measuring under vacuum and by infrared camera , and then comparing temperature profiles on both reference standard material and a CNT sheet sample. The highly anisotropic thermal conductivities of CNT sheets were characterized comprehensively , with κ/ρ in alignment direction as ∼ 95 mW m
