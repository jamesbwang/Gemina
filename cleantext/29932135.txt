  ( & minus ;-RRB-- Epicatechin ( E) is a flavanol found in green tea and cocoa and has been shown to attenuate tumour necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNF- & alpha ;-RRB-- mediated inflammation<symptom> , improve nitric oxide levels , promote endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS) activation and inhibit NADPH oxidase. This study investigated the effect of 28 days of low epicatechin dosing ( 1 mg/kg/day) on the cardiovascular function of deoxycorticosterone acetate ( DOCA)- salt hypertensive rats. Wistar rats ( n = 120 , 8 weeks of age) underwent uninephrectomy and were randomised into four groups ( uninephrectomy ( UNX) , UNX + E , DOCA , DOCA + E). DOCA and DOCA + E rats received 1 % NaCl drinking water along with subcutaneous injections of 25 mg deoxycorticosterone-acetate ( in 0.4 mL of dimethylformamide) every fourth day. UNX + E and DOCA + E rats received 1 mg/kg/day of epicatechin by oral gavage. Single-cell micro-electrode electrophysiology , Langendorff isolated-heart assessment and isolated aorta and mesenteric organ baths were used to assess cardiovascular parameters. Serum malondialdehyde concentration was used as a marker of oxidative stress. Myocardial stiffness was increased and left ventricular compliance significantly diminished in the DOCA control group , and these changes were attenuated by epicatechin treatment (
