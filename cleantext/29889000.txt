  A cross-sectional study was conducted on 40 women weavers of Samarinda sarongs to identify the prevalence and risk factors of musculoskeletal disorders ( MSDs). A Nordic body map , rapid upper limb assessment and anthropometric tools were used to plot the MSD severity , work posture<symptom> and anthropometric dimensions of the weavers , respectively. The age , education background , working period and prolonged sitting position distributions of the weavers were collected by direct interview. Pearson 's product-moment correlation was applied to identify correlations between the MSD prevalence and other parameters. An MSD prevalence of 80.5 % was found among the women weavers , with the MSDs categorized as low , moderate and high in 15.0 , 75.0 and 7.5 % of the respondents , respectively. The MSD prevalence was significantly correlated with education background ( p = 0.025) , working period ( p = 0.015) , prolonged sitting hours ( p = 0.032) , work posture<symptom> ( p < 0.001) and weavers ' anthropometry ( p < 0.001).
