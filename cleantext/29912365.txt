  Model-based estimates of general deleteriousness , like CADD , DANN or PolyPhen , have become indispensable tools in the interpretation of genetic variants. However , these approaches say little about the tissues in which the effects of deleterious variants will be most meaningful. Tissue-specific annotations have been recently inferred for dozens of tissues/cell types from large collections of cross-tissue epigenomic data , and have demonstrated sensitivity in predicting affected tissues in complex traits. It remains unclear , however , whether including additional genome-scale data specific to the tissue of interest would appreciably improve functional annotations. Here , we introduce TiSAn ( Tissue Specific Annotation) , a tool that integrates multiple genome-scale data sources , defined by expert knowledge. TiSAn uses machine learning to discriminate variants relevant to a tissue from those with no bearing on the function of that tissue. Predictions are made genome-wide , and can be used to contextualize and filter variants of interest in whole genome sequencing or genome wide association studies ( GWAS). We demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of TiSAn by producing predictive models for human heart and brain , and detecting tissue-relevant variations in large cohorts for autism spectrum disorder ( TiSAn-brain) and coronary artery disease ( TiSAn-heart). We find the multi-omics TiSAn model is better able to prioritize genetic variants according to their tissue-specific action than the current state of the art method , GenoSkyLine.
