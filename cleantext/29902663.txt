  The feasibility of fatigue<symptom> damage evaluation has been investigated using nonlinear Lamb waves with group-velocity mismatching. To choose an efficient mode pair , a parameter is proposed to quantify the efficiency of cumulative second-harmonic generation ( SHG) of Lamb waves based on the normal modal analysis. Experiments and simulations are performed to verify the proposed parameter , which demonstrates that whether the matching condition of group velocity is satisfied or not , the efficiency of cumulative SHG increases with the order of Lamb mode for the five low-order Lamb waves investigated. Then , S3-s6 mode pair with group-velocity mismatching is chosen to characterize the fatigue<symptom> damage of an aluminium alloy for the high efficiency of cumulative SHG. Results show that S3-s6 mode pair is sensitive to fatigue<symptom> damage evolution and the integrated amplitude of second harmonics increases by nearly 300 % with fatigue<symptom> cycles. Nonlinear Lamb waves with group-velocity mismatching are validated to be a candidate to efficiently evaluate the fatigue<symptom> damage.
