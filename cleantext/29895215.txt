  Radiation-induced lung injury ( RILI) occurs most often in radiotherapy of lung cancer , esophageal cancer , and other thoracic cancers. The occurrence of RILI is a complex process that includes a variety of cellular and molecular interactions , which ultimately result in carcinogenesis. However , the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we show that Ras-related C3 botulinum<pathogen> toxin substrate 2 ( RAC2) and transcription factor jun-B ( JUNB) were upregulated in non-small cell carcinoma ( NSCLC) tissues and were associated with poor prognoses for NSCLC patients. Ionizing radiation also caused increased expression of RAC2 in quiescent stage cells , and the reentry of quiescent cells into a new cell cycle. The activity of the serum response factor ( SRF) was activated by RAC2 and other Rho family genes ( RhoA , ROCK , and LIM kinase). Consequently , JUNB acted as an oncogene and induced abnormal proliferation of quiescent cells. Together , the results showed that RAC2 can be used as a target gene for radiation protection. A better understanding of the RAC2 and JUNB mechanisms in the molecular etiology of lung cancer will be helpful in reducing cancer risks and side effects during treatment of this disorder. Our study therefore provides a new perspective on the involvement of RAC2 and JUNB as oncogenes in the tumorigenesis of NSCLC.
