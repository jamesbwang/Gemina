  The presence of antidepressants , such as venlafaxine ( VFX) , in marine ecosystems is increasing , thus , potentially posing ecological and human health risks. The inherent mechanisms of VFX uptake and elimination still require further understanding , particularly accounting for the impact of climate change-related stressors , such as warming and acidification. Hence , the present work aimed to investigate , for the first time , the effects of increased seawater temperature ( ΔT °C = +5 °C) and pCO
