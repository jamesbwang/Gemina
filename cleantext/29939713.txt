  Because of their extraordinary surface areas and tailorable porosity , metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs) have the potential to be excellent sensors of gas-phase analytes. MOFs with open metal sites are particularly attractive for detecting Lewis basic atmospheric analytes , such as water. Here , we demonstrate that thin films of the MOF HKUST-1 can be used to quantitatively determine the relative humidity ( RH) of air using a colorimetric approach. HKUST-1 thin films are spin-coated onto rigid or flexible substrates and are shown to quantitatively determine the RH within the range of 0.1-5 % RH by either visual observation or a straightforward optical reflectivity measurement. At high humidity ( > 10 % RH) , a polymer/MOF bilayer is used to slow the transport of H
