  Breastfeeding is optimal for infant health , but more than 66 % of mothers cease exclusive breastfeeding within three months after giving birth. Evaluating infants ' sucking effort provides valuable diagnosis to mothers encountering barriers with breastfeeding. Sucking microstructure is defined as an array of metrics that comprehensively capture infants ' ability to create a sealed latch onto mother 's nipple and regulate feeding , including number of sucks , sucks per burst , number of bursts , intra suck interval , and maximal sucking<symptom> pressure. In this paper , we proposed a breastfeeding diagnostic device ( BDD) which allows convenient and objective measurement of infants ' sucking microstructure in both home and clinical settings. BDD utilizes an air-based pressure transducer to measure infants ' sucking<symptom> behavior. We conducted pilot clinical studies on six dyads of mother and infant to test the feasibility of the BDD system. To facilitate comparison , both breastfeeding and bottle-feeding were conducted on the six dyads using the BDD in home settings , and the outcomes are comparable with prior recordings in research or clinical settings. By offering a convenient and objective measurement of the sucking microstructure , the BDD will provide clinically meaningful guidance and diagnosis to mothers struggling with breastfeeding. BDD will also serve as an objective metric useful in research areas relevant to infant behaviors , assessment of neurodevelopment , and potentially a screening tool for developmental disabilities.
