  Immunocompromised mice are used frequently in biomedical research , in part because they accommodate the engraftmentandstudy of primary human cells within a mouse model; however , these animals are susceptible to opportunistic infectionsand require special husbandry considerations. In 2015 , an outbreak marked by high morbidity but low mortality swept througha colony of immunocompromised mice; this outbreak rapidly affected 75 % of the colony and ultimately required completedepopulation of the barrier suite. Conventional microbiologic and molecular diagnostics were unsuccessful in determiningthe cause; therefore , we explored culture-independent methods to broadly profile the microbial community in the feces of affected animals. This approach identified 4 bacterial taxa-Candidatus Arthromitus , Clostridium<pathogen> celatum<pathogen> , Clostridiales bacterium<pathogen> VE202-01 , and Bifidobacterium<pathogen> pseudolongum strain PV8-2- that were significantly enriched in the affected mice. Based on these results , specific changes were made to the animal husbandry procedures for immunocompromised mice. This case report highlights the utility of culture-independent methods in laboratory animal diagnostics.
