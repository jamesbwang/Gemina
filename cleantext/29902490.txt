  Prenatal dexamethasone exposure ( PDE) could induce testicular developmental toxicity in adults. The present study aims to confirm its intrauterine origination , and to explore its potential intrauterine programming mechanism. The pregnant rats were respectively injected subcutaneously with 0.2 and 0.8 mg/kg d dexamethasone during gestational days ( GD) 9 to 20. The testes and serum of offspring rats were collected on GD20 and postnatal week ( PW) 12. In vivo , PDE significantly induced the abnormal testicular morphology in offspring from GD20 to PW12. Moreover , the serum and intratesticular testosterone levels and the expression of testicular steroidogenic acute regulatory protein ( StAR) were reduced by PDE. The expression levels of glucocorticoid receptor ( GR) and histone deacetylase 7 ( HDAC7) were increased in fetal testes. Furthermore , the histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation ( H3K9ac) level in the StAR promoter was decreased by PDE from GD20 to PW12. In vitro , mouse Leydig tumour cell line ( MLTC-1) cells were treated with dexamethasone ( 20 , 100 and 500 nM) , and the testosterone production and StAR expression were reduced. Moreover , dexamethasone increased the expression of HDAC7 by activating GR , which decreased the H3K9ac level in the StAR promoter. Taken together , PDE caused testicular dysplasia before and after birth in male offspring rats , and its mechanism was related to the low-expressional programming of StAR mediated by decreasing H3K9ac level.
