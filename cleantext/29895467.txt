  Effective management of hospital staff time is crucial to quality patient care. Recent years have seen widespread implementation of electronic health record ( EHR) systems but the effect of this on documentation time is unknown. This review compares time spent on documentation tasks by hospital staff ( physicians , nurses and interns) before and after EHR implementation. A systematic search identified 8153 potentially relevant citations. Studies examining proportion of total workload spent on documentation with â‰¥ 40 h of staff observation time were included. Meta-analysis was performed for physicians , nurses and interns comparing pre- and post-EHR results. Studies were weighted by person-hours observation time. Twenty-eight studies met selection criteria. Seventeen were pre-EHR , nine post-EHR and two examined both periods. With implementation of EHR , physicians ' documentation time increased from 16 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 11-22 %) to 28 % ( 95 % CI 19-37 %) , nurses from 9 % ( 95 % CI 6-12 %) to 23 % ( 95 % CI 15-32 %) and interns from 20 % ( 95 % CI 7-32 %) to 26 % ( 95 % CI 10-42 %). There is a lack of long-term follow-up on the effects of EHR implementation. Initial adjustment to EHR appears to increase documentation time but there is some evidence that as staff become more familiar with the system , it may ultimately improve work flow.
