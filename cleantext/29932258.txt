  Whether porcine cytokines are induced after pig-to-primate xenotransplantation and activate human cells remains unknown. First , we investigated the regulation of porcine IL-6 , IFN-γ , IL-1β , and TNF-α in xenotransplantation using an in vitro model in which porcine aortic endothelial cells ( PAECs) and porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) were stimulated with human serum. Downstream cytokines/chemokines were monitored. Pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-6 , IFN-γ , and IL-1β) and chemokines ( IL-8 , MCP-1 , and CXCL2) were upregulated in the both cell types. TNF-α was induced 10-fold in PAECs , but not in PBMCs. Then , we assessed the role of porcine IL-6 , IFN-γ , IL-1β , and TNF-α in xenotransplantation using western blotting and real-time PCR. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) were selected as the target cells. Signaling pathways and downstream genes , such as those related to adhesion , inflammation<symptom> , and coagulation , and chemokines were investigated. Porcine IL-1β and TNF-α significantly activated NF-κB and P38 , and STAT3 was activated by porcine IL-6 in HUVECs. The adhesion genes ( E-selectin , VCAM-1 , and ICAM-1) , inflammatory cytokines ( IL-6 , IL-1β , and TNF-α) , chemokines ( MCP-1 and IL-8) , and the pro-coagulation gene ( tissue factor) were upregulated by porcine IL-1β and TNF-α. Porcine IL-6 increased the expression of ICAM-1 , IL-6 , MCP-1 , and tissue factor , but decreased IL-8 expression slightly. Surprisingly , porcine IFN-γ could not activate STAT1 or regulate the expression of any of the above genes in HUVECs. In conclusion , these findings suggest that porcine IL-6 , IL-1β , and TNF-α activate HUVECs and regulate downstream genes expression , which may promote inflammation<symptom> and coagulation response after xenotransplantation.
