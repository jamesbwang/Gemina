  In the present study , the contemporary indoor radon activity concentration and the surface-deposited 210Po activity were measured in 65 Romanian dwellings. The activity of trapped 210Po on the glass surface was measured using the ( CR-LR) difference technique. The retrospective radon activity concentration estimated on the basis of age-adjusted 210Po activity was found to have a geometric mean of 318 Bq m-3 , being higher than the geometric mean ( 250 Bq m-3) of the contemporary indoor radon measurements , measured with two types of track detectors ( RSKS and Radtrak2 ®). By applying Lin 's concordance correlation coefficient , a substantial strength of agreement ( rC = 0.94) was obtained between RSKS and Radtrak2 ® results , respectively a poor agreement ( rC = 0.71) between the retrospective and contemporary methods. The ratio between contemporary and retrospective radon concentrations has a geometric mean of 0.8 and range from 0.2 to 3.9.
