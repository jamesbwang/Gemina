  The role of vascular calcifications in iliac arteries for predicting global atherosclerotic burden in still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether iliac calcium score ( ICS) , a new computed tomographic angiography ( CTA) derived biomarker of vascular calcification , can predict the severity and complexity of peripheral arterial disease ( PAD) as well as the global atherosclerotic burden. This was a single centre , non-randomized , observational prospective study on 84 consecutive patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease , undergoing peripheral CTA examination of the lower limbs , divided into high ( n = 42) and low ICS ( n = 42) groups with a median value for ICS of 3934 HU. Patients with high ICS were significantly older ( 66.2 ± 8.0 vs. 62.8 ± 11.2 , p < 0.0001) and were more frequently diabetic ( 61.9 vs. 38.1 % , p = 0.04). ICS was significantly higher in patients with Rutherford stage 5-6 vs. 1-2 ( p = 0.03) and in TASC D or TASC C vs. TASC B class ( p = 0.01). Mean iliac intima-media thickness ( i-IMT) was significantly higher in the high ICS group compared to the low ICS group ( 1.3 ± 0.2 vs. 0.9 ± 0.2 , p < 0.0001). Linear regression analysis demonstrated a very good correlation between ICS and i-IMT ( r = 0.59 , p < 0.0001 for right , r = 0.57 , p < 0.0001 for left and r = 0.67 , p < 0.0001 for both iliac arteries averaged). Patients with high ICS presented a significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction compared to those with low ICS ( 45.3 ± 4.3 vs. 53.8 ± 4.8 , p < 0.0001). Linear regression analysis demonstrated significant inverse correlation between ICS and left ventricular EF ( r = -0.54 , p < 0.0001). Increased values of ICS , a new CTA marker of vascular calcification , are associated with a higher severity and complexity of PAD and a more depressed left ventricular function. High ICS values are also associated with increased i-IMT. Both can represent new surrogate markers of an increased atherosclerotic burden.
