  Deep learning has been increasingly used to solve a number of problems with state-of-the-art performance in a wide variety of fields. In biology , deep learning can be applied to reduce feature extraction time and achieve high levels of performance. In our present work , we apply deep learning via two-dimensional convolutional neural networks and position-specific scoring matrices to classify Rab protein molecules , which are main regulators in membrane trafficking for transferring proteins and other macromolecules throughout the cell. The functional loss of specific Rab molecular functions has been implicated in a variety of human<disease> diseases<disease> , e.g. , choroideremia , intellectual disabilities , cancer. Therefore , creating a precise model for classifying Rabs is crucial in helping biologists understand the molecular functions of Rabs and design drug targets according to such specific human<disease> disease<disease> information. We constructed a robust deep neural network for classifying Rabs that achieved an accuracy of 99 % , 99.5 % , 96.3 % , and 97.6 % for each of four specific molecular functions. Our approach demonstrates superior performance to traditional artificial neural networks. Therefore , from our proposed study , we provide both an effective tool for classifying Rab proteins and a basis for further research that can improve the performance of biological modeling using deep neural networks.
