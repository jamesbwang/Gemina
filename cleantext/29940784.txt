  Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( PCSK9) is expressed in multiple tissues , including the small intestine. The effect of PCSK9 inhibition on cholesterol absorption is not known. Measure serum cholesterol absorption markers before and after initiation of PCSK9 inhibitors. Single-center retrospective cohort of patients administered evolocumab and alirocumab between July 2015 and January 2017. Paired t tests were used to compare mean serum cholesterol marker concentrations , and ratios to total cholesterol , before and after PCSK9 inhibitor initiation. Analyses were repeated for those taking and not taking statins and taking or not taking ezetimibe at both initiation and follow-up , for each PCSK9 inhibitor , and based on follow-up time ( < 60 , 60-120 , and > 120 days). There were 62 possible participants , 34 were excluded for lack of data or unknown PCSK9 inhibitor initiation date. Average follow-up was 92.5 days. Mean campesterol ( before 3.14 μg/mL , 95 % CI: 2.79-4.38 μg/mL; after 2.09 μg/mL , 95 % CI: 1.87-2.31 μg/mL; P < .0001) , sitosterol ( before 2.46 μg/mL , 95 % CI: 2.23-2.70 μg/mL; after 1.62 μg/mL , 95 % CI: 1.48-1.75 μg/mL; P < .0001) , and cholestanol ( before 3.25 μg/mL , 95 % CI: 3.04-3.47 μg/mL; after 2.08 μg/mL , 95 % CI: 1.96-2.21 μg/mL; P < .0001) all significantly decreased at follow-up. There was no significant change in absorption marker to total cholesterol ratios. Findings were not influenced by statin or ezetimibe use or nonuse , which PCSK9 inhibitor was prescribed , or time to follow-up. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibition was associated with decreased cholesterol absorption markers.
