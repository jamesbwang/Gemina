  Operon-mapper is a web server that accurately , easily , and directly predicts the operons of any bacterial or archaeal genome sequence. The operon predictions are based on the intergenic distance of neighboring genes as well as the functional relationships of their protein-coding products. To this end , Operon-mapper finds all the ORFs within a given nucleotide sequence , along with their genomic coordinates , orthology groups , and functional relationships. We believe that Operon-mapper , due to its accuracy , simplicity and speed , as well as the relevant information that it generates , will be a useful tool for annotating and characterizing genomic sequences. http://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx/operon_mapper/.
