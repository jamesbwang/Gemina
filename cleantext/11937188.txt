  Non-cardiogenic pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> ( NCPE) after intravenous ( iv) administration of non-ionic radiocontrast media ( RCM) is a rare but life-threatening complication. In a context of emergency , its diagnosis is difficult. We report the case of a 55-year-old woman who developed an acute<symptom> pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> following iv infusion of non-ionic , low-osmolar RCM during abdominal CT scan. She needed a 24-hour hospitalization in intensive care unit for an acute hypoxemic dyspnea<symptom>. She was falsely treated at first for an anaphylactic reaction , and then for a cardiac failure. She improved with cortisone and diuretic treatment. Although NCPE has been rarely reported after RCM injection , it remains an acute severe complication that has to be considered. The differential diagnosis involves multiple pathogenic patterns giving furthermore complexity in choosing an appropriate treatment.
