  Research on antepartum psychiatric morbidities investigating depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms in expectant mothers and fathers is lacking in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of antepartum depressive , anxiety<symptom> and co-occurring significant symptoms and explore the associated factors in a cross-section of Malaysian expectant mothers and fathers. We used cross-sectional data from a prospective cohort study of 911 expectant mothers and 587 expectant fathers during their third trimester of pregnancy , from health clinics of two states in the east and west coasts of Malaysia. The validated Malay version of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression<symptom> Scale and the anxiety<symptom> sub-scale of Depression<symptom> , Anxiety<symptom> and Stress Scale were used to measure the depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analyses identified the determinants of antepartum depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms ( ADS and AAS). Prevalence of ADS was 12.2 % in expectant mothers and 8.4 % in expectant fathers , while AAS was 28.8 % in expectant mothers and 13.3 % in expectant fathers , and co-occurring significant symptoms was 8.0 % in expectant mothers and 4.0 % in expectant fathers. Expectant mothers and fathers having perceived social/family support were less likely to suffer from ADS. Intimate partner violence , poor relationship with husbands , depression<symptom> in earlier pregnancy and husband 's depression<symptom> in current pregnancy in expectant mothers , and living in rented house , sex preference for the unborn child , stressful life events and wife 's depression<symptom> in current pregnancy in expectant fathers were associated with a greater likelihood of ADS. The determinants for AAS were living in rented house and with parents/in-laws , poor relationship with husbands , restrictions during pregnancy and stressful life events for expectant mothers , and stressful life events and being unsupportive towards wives in household chores for expectant fathers. Both ADS and AAS are prevalent in expectant mothers and fathers , and largely an undetected problem in Malaysia. Administration of couple-based screening and referral program during antenatal check-up should be universal practices to identify and treat the psychiatric morbidities.
