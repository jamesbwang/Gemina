  We describe the case of a patient with well-localized focal seizures<symptom> originating from the medial parietal cortex. Seizures<symptom> originated from area 7m , and findings revealed clear visuospatial semiological signs that may be used clinically to help diagnose similar cases of seizures<symptom> in non-lesional patients.
