  Direction selectivity is a fundamental computation in the visual system and is first computed by the direction-selective circuit in the mammalian retina. While landmark discoveries on the neural basis of direction selectivity have been made in the rabbit , many technological advances designed for the mouse have emerged , making this organism a favored model for investigating the direction-selective circuit at the molecular , synaptic , and network levels. Studies using diverse motion stimuli in the mouse retina demonstrate that retinal direction selectivity is implemented by multilayered mechanisms. This review begins with a set of central mechanisms that are engaged under a wide range of visual conditions , and then focuses on additional layers of mechanisms that are dynamically recruited under different visual stimulus conditions. Together , recent findings allude to an emerging theme: robust motion detection in the natural environment requires flexible neural mechanisms.
