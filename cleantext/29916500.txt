  Angiogenesis is a common pathological characteristic of many solid tumors and vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. Photothermal therapy ( PTT) is a promising method to reduce neovascularization. To increase the targeting ability and efficiency of PTT , a novel polymeric nanosystem that encapsulates phthalocyanine zinc ( ZnPc) and perfluorohexane ( PFH) was developed to target the new blood vessels of breast tumors. After being conjugated to the anti-VEGFR-2 antibody , the polymeric nanoparticles ( NPs) targeted vascular endothelial cells efficiently. The photosensitizer ( PS) in the NPs could convert laser energy into heat , generating local high temperatures to kill the surrounding cells under laser irradiation. In addition , the liquid-gas phase transition of PFH was induced , and an enhanced ultrasound ( US) and photoacoustic ( PA) image could be obtained. US/PA imaging enables visualization of the location of NPs , and laser irradiation position can be guided to the optimal location , resulting in fewer side effects than those from traditional treatments with a high targeting ability and an efficient synergistic effect from the PTT.
