  The use of gas cluster media as a target for an intense femtosecond laser pulses is considered to be uniquely convenient approach for the development of a compact versatile pulsed source of ionizing radiation. Also , one may consider cluster media as a nanolab to investigate fundamental issues of intense optical fields interaction with sub-wavelength scale structures. However , conventional diagnostic methods fail to register highly charged ion states from a cluster plasma because of strong recombination in the ambient gas. In the paper we introduce high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy method allowing to study energy spectra of highly charged ions created in the area of most intense laser radiation. The emission of CO
