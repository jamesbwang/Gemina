  Gastrin-releasing peptide ( GRP) is thought to play a role in the metastatic process of various malignancies. The more stable precursor of GRP , pro-GRP ( ProGRP) , has been shown to be secreted by neuroendocrine tumors. This study was designed to assess the validity of ProGRP as a diagnostic marker in endometrioid adenocarcinomas ( EAs) of the endometrium. Thirty-seven patients with a diagnosis of EA , 23 patients with endometrial hyperplasia<disease> , and 32 age-matched controls with normal endometrial histology were recruited for this study. Serum ProGRP and cancer antigen 125 ( CA125) values were compared between groups. Median serum ProGRP levels were significantly higher in the cancer group compared to corresponding levels in both the hyperplasia<disease> and control groups ( p = 0.008 and p < 0.001 respectively; endometrial cancer: 27.5 pg/mL; hyperplasia<disease>: 16.1 pg/mL; controls: 12.9 pg/mL). Age and endometrial thickness were positively correlated with ProGRP levels ( r = 0.322 , p = 0.006 and r = 0.269 , p = 0.023 , respectively). Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analyses for EA revealed a threshold of 20.81 pg/mL , with a sensitivity of 60.7 % and specificity of 81.4 % , positive predictive value of 68 % and negative predictive value of 76.1 %. Significantly higher ProGRP levels were observed in patients with EA than in controls. Serum ProGRP has good diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for EA.
