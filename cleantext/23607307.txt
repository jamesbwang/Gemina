  The main chemosensory organs of locusts consisted of the antennae and the mouthparts ( maxillary and labial palps) , which are suggested to perform different functions. However , very few are known about the differences of these two organs at molecular level. To understand the differences of locust antennae and palps in olfaction , the electrophysiological response and olfactory gene expression of these two organs were conducted. Our electrophysiological experiments with
