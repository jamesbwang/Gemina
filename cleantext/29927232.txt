  Ultraviolet photodissociation ( UVPD) is a nonselective activation method in which both precursor and fragment ions may absorb photons and dissociate. Photoactivation of fragment ions may result in secondary or multiple generations of dissociation , which decreases the signal-to-noise ratio ( S/N) of larger fragment ions owing to the prevalent subdivision of the ion current into many smaller , often less informative , fragment ions. Here we report the use of dipolar excitation waveforms to displace fragment ions out of the laser beam path , thus alleviating the extent of secondary dissociation during 193 nm UVPD. This fragment ion protection ( FIP) strategy increases S/N of larger fragment ions and improves the sequence coverage obtained for proteins via retaining information deeper into the midsection of protein sequences.
