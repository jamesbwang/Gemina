  Interface engineering has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy for enhancing the thermoelectric ( TE) performance of materials. However , a very typical interface in semiconductors , that is , the PN junction ( PNJ) , is scarcely adopted by the thermoelectrical community because of the coexistence of holes and electrons. Interestingly , our explorative results provide a definitively positive case that appropriate PNJs are able to enhance the TE performance of p-type Sb
