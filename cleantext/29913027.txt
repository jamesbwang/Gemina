  The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of nonopioid pain management following arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and/or chondroplasty and to assess patients ' attitudes regarding their need for opioid pain medication following these procedures. Patients who underwent a knee arthroscopy procedure for either partial meniscectomy and/or chondroplasty from July 2016 to January 2017 by a single surgeon at a single institution were included. Medical records were reviewed , and demographics were recorded. Two weeks postoperatively , patients self-reported opioid and nonopioid medication use. Patients were also questioned regarding their perceived need for opioid medication , whether they felt their pain was adequately controlled , and how their pain compared with their preoperative expectations. Thirty-four patients ( 17 male , 17 female) , with a mean age at the time of surgery of 47.79 years ( range , 19-68 years) , were included. Eighty-two percent ( n = 28) of the patients reported using nonopioid analgesics for pain control , whereas 18 % ( n = 6) reported using opioids. Of those not using opioids , 96.4 % ( n = 27) reported not feeling the need for opioid medications. Three of 6 patients requiring opioids were unable to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. All 6 patients who took opioids felt that they needed them for adequate pain control. This study provides initial encouragement that it is largely possible to remove opioids from the postoperative pain regimen of knee arthroscopy patients and maintain adequate pain control and patient satisfaction.
