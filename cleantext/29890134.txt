  It was shown that CAR participates in the regulation of many cell processes. Thus , the activation of CAR causes a proliferating effect in the liver , which provides grounds to consider CAR as a therapeutic target when having a partial resection of this organ. Even though a lot of work has been done on the function of CAR in regulating hepatocyte proliferation , very little has been done on its complex mediating mechanism. This study , therefore , showed that the liver growth resulting from CAR activation leads to the decline in the level of PTEN protein and subsequent Akt activation in mouse liver. The increase of Akt activation produced by CAR agonist was accompanied by a decrease in the level of Foxo1 , which was correlated with decreased expression of Foxo1 target genes , including Cdkn1a ( p21). Moreover , the study also demonstrated that there exists a negative regulatory impact of CAR on the relationship between Foxo1 and targeted Cdkn1a ( p21) promoter. Therefore , the study results revealed an essential function of CAR-Akt-Foxo1 signalling pathway in controlling hepatocyte proliferation by repressing the cell cycle regulator Cdkn1a ( p21).
