  Active control of metamaterial properties is critical for advanced terahertz ( THz) applications. However , the tunability of THz properties , such as the resonance frequency and phase of the wave , remains challenging. Here , a new device design is provided for extensively tuning the resonance properties of THz metamaterials. Unlike previous approaches , the design is intended to control the electrical interconnections between the metallic unit structures of metamaterials. This strategy is referred to as the molecularization of the meta-atoms and is accomplished by placing graphene bridges between the metallic unit structures whose conductivity is modulated by an electrolyte gating. Because of the scalable nature of the molecularization , the resonance frequency of the terahertz metamaterials can be tuned as a function of the number of meta-atoms constituting a unit metamolecule. At the same time , the voltage-controlled molecularization allows delicate control over the phase shift of the transmitted THz , without changing the high transmission of the materials significantly.
