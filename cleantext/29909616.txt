  The ability to predict and control the formation of bimetallic heterogeneous nanocrystals is desirable for many applications in plasmonics and catalysis. Here , we report the synthesis and characterization of stable , monodisperse , and solution-processed Cu-Ag bimetallic nanoparticles with specific but unusual elemental arrangements that are consistent with a recently developed thermodynamic model. Using air-free scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy , the distribution of Cu and Ag positions was unambiguously identified within individual nanocrystals ( NCs) , leading to the discovery of a Cu-Ag nanocrescent shape. A simple yet versatile thermodynamic model was applied to illustrate how the interplay between surface and interface energies determines the particle morphology. It is found that there exists a range of surface-to-interface energy ratios under which crescent-shaped nanocrystals are the thermodynamically favored products , with the morphology tunable by adjusting the Ag content. We further show the conversion of Cu-Ag nanocrescents into Ag@Cu
