  Poxviruses are emerging pathogens in cetaceans , temporarily named ` Cetaceanpoxvirus ' ( CePV , family Poxviridae) , classified into two main lineages: CePV-1 in odontocetes and CePV-2 in mysticetes. Only a few studies performed the molecular detection of CePVs , based on DNA-polymerase gene and/or DNA-topoisomerase I gene amplification. Herein we describe a new real-time PCR assay based on SYBR
