  Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis<disease> ( SEP) , or abdominal cocoon is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction , and still etiology remains unknown. We report a series of 4 patients with abdominal cocoon , and all the 4 patients had previously undergone living-donor liver transplantation ( LDLT). There was no evidence of SEP before and during LDLT. At the time of diagnosis of SEP , 3 out of 4 patients had ascites. First and fourth patients had multiple episodes or attacks of cholangitis , which were managed by percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and hepaticojejunostomy , respectively. All 4 patients presented with intestinal obstruction and 3 of them underwent a successful operation. The fourth patient died due to liver failure and complications of the SEP.. The first 3 patients are doing well without SEP recurrence. Our experience suggest that the prognosis of SEP is poor in patients with poor graft liver functions after LDLT.
