  Despite data linking the social environment to physical inactivity in Latinas , research on social network predictors of physical activity ( PA) is limited. This study examined social network predictors of PA change in Latinas. Egocentric network data were collected from 102 adult Latinas ( egos) participating in a randomized controlled PA intervention trial for underactive women. Moderate-to-vigorous PA ( MVPA) was measured in minutes per week using the 7-Day PA Recall Interview and accelerometers at baseline and 12 months. Analyses characterized social network structure , composition , tie strength , homogeneity , and support for PA and determined the relationship between network characteristics and PA outcomes. Networks had an average of four social ties ( alters). Networks were high in density and transitivity and low in components , indicating high cohesion. Networks were primarily composed of females , Latinos , Spanish-speakers , and family members. Relationship ties were strong as evidenced by close living proximity , in-person contact , high emotional closeness , and long relationship duration. There was high homogeneity in demographics and PA behaviors. Multivariate analyses revealed that network size , familial ties , contact frequency , and ego-alter dissimilarities in age and running but similarities in walking , were associated with increased MVPA. Networks high in support for PA in the form of complimenting ego on exercise , taking over chores to allow ego to exercise , and co-participating with ego in exercise were also associated with greater MVPA. These findings contribute to better understanding interpersonal processes that may influence behavior change in a group with especially low levels of PA..
