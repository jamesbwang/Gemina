  Sustainable production of renewable fuels has become an imperative goal but also remains a huge challenge faced by the chemical industry. A variety of low-value , renewable sources of carbon such as wastes and by-products must be evaluated for their potential as feedstock to achieve this goal. Hydrogenation of blends comprising waste animal fat ( ≤ 70 wt %) and low-value fluid catalytic cracking light cycle oil ( ≥ 30 wt %) , with a total aromatic content of 87.2 wt % , was studied on a commercial sulfided NiMo/Al
