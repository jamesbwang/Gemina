  We evaluated whether nucleos ( t) ide analog ( NA) influences the risk of non-hepatocellular carcinoma ( non-HCC) malignancies in patients with chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( CHB). A total of 9867 patients with CHB were followed up for ≥ 12 months for the occurrence of any type of malignancy between 1998 and 2013. Patients who received NA for ≥ 180 days were defined as the NA group. Propensity score matching produced the control ( n = 2220) and NA groups ( n = 2220) after adjustment for age , sex , and the presence of diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis. The National Health Insurance Service sample cohort dataset was used for external validation. Regarding non-HCC malignancies , only old age was an independent risk factor ( > 50 years; hazard ratio 3.17 , 95 % confidence interval 1.71-5.88 , P < .001) in multivariate analysis. With regard to specific cancers such as thyroid , breast , lung , stomach , colorectal , pancreatobiliary , and hematologic malignancy , there was no difference of the incidence of each malignancy between the NA and control groups in both the hospital-based and external validation cohorts. NA treatment neither raises nor lowers the incidence of non-HCC malignancies in patients with CHB. Patients > 50 years old are encouraged to undergo surveillance for malignancies similar to the general population.
