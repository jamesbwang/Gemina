  The production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies is costly; therefore , antigen-binding fragments ( Fabs) can be used instead. However , their tendency toward aggregation can reduce the half-life in the plasma and the therapeutic effectiveness. To examine the effect of glycosylation on the properties of the Fab of a therapeutic antibody , an N-glycosylation site was introduced at position 178 of the H-chain constant region of adalimumab Fab through site-directed mutagenesis of L178 N ( H: L178 N Fab) , and then H: L178 N Fab was expressed in Pichia pastoris. SDS-PAGE analysis with treatment of N-glycosidase F or periodic acid-Schiff reagent showed that H: L178 N Fab contained a relatively low glycan level. Moreover , the H: L178 N mutation did not decrease the binding activity and thermal stability of Fab , and H: L178 N Fab was more resistant to protease digestion than wild-type Fab. The aggregation of Fab induced by pH-shift stress was measured by monitoring the optical density at 350 nm. Although the wild-type Fab showed a large increase in optical density with an increase of protein concentration , no such increase of turbidity during aggregation was found in H: L178 N Fab. These results demonstrated that glycosylation at position 178 of the H-chain constant region of adalimumab Fab can prevent protein aggregation , and therefore serve as a potentially effective platform for drug development.
