  Intra-aortic balloon pumps ( IABPs) have been used routinely since the 1970s. Recently , large randomized trials failed to show that IABP therapy has meaningful benefit , and international recommendations downgraded its place , particularly in cardiogenic shock<symptom>. The aim of this registry was to describe the contemporary use of IABP therapy , in light of these new data. This prospective multicentre registry included 172 patients implanted with an IABP in 19 French cardiac centres in 2015. Baseline characteristics , aetiologies leading to IABP use , and IABP-related and disease-related complications were assessed. In-hospital and 1-year mortality rates were studied. A total of 172 patients were included ( mean age 65.5 Â± 12.0 years; 118 men ( 68.6 %)). The reasons for IABP implantation were mainly haemodynamic ( n = 107; 62.2 %) , followed by bridge to revascularization ( n = 34; 19.8 %) and four other `` rare '' aetiologies ( n = 29 patients; 16.8 %). In-hospital and 1-year mortality rates were 40.7 % and 45.8 % , respectively. Fourteen patients ( 8.1 %) experienced ischaemic or haemorrhagic complications , which were directly related to the IABP in seven patients ( 4.1 %). Despite current international guidelines regarding the place of IABPs in ischaemic cardiogenic shock<symptom> without mechanical complications , this aetiology remains the leading cause for its utilization in the contemporary era.
