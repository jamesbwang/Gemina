  Cardiovascular disease ( CVD) is a leading global cause of death and morbidity and prevention needs to be strengthened to tackle this. Mobile health ( mHealth) might present a novel and effective solution in CVD prevention , and interest in mHealth has grown dramatically since the advent of the smartphone. In this review , we discuss mHealth interventions that target multiple cardiovascular risk factors simultaneously in the context of primary as well as secondary prevention. There is some evidence that mHealth interventions improve a range of individual CVD risk factors , but a relative paucity of evidence on mHealth interventions improving multiple CVD risk factors simultaneously. The existing data suggest mHealth programs improve overall CVD risk , at least in the short term. Interpretation of the evidence is difficult in the context of poor methodology and mHealth modalities often being a part of large complex interventions. In this review we identify a number of unanswered questions including: which mode of mHealth ( or combination of interventions) would be most effective , what is the durability of intervention effects , and what degree of personalization and interactivity is required.
