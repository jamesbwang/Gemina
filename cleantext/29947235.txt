  The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects and mechanism of miRNA-31 in synovial cells apoptosis induced by RA. The miRNA-31 gene expressions were extracted from synovial tissues of normal and RA patients by RT-PCR and H et E staining. The synovial cells of RA patients were isolated and randomly divided into Control , Blank and miRNA groups. The cell apoptosis of difference groups were measured by flow cytometry; the TNF-α and IL-1β concentrations of difference groups were measured by Elisa assay; TLR4 and NF-κB proteins expressions were measured by WB assay and the correlation between TLR4 and miRNA-31 were evaluated by double luciferase target experiment. The miRNA-31 gene expression was significantly suppressed in RA tissues ( p < 0.001); Compared with control group , the cell apoptosis rate of miRNA group was significantly suppressed ( p < 0.001); TNF-α and IL-1β concentrations were significantly down-regulation in culture fluid ( p < 0.001 , respectively) and TLR4 and NF-κB proteins expressions were significantly depressed ( p < 0.001 , respectively) in miRNA group. By double luciferase target experiment , the TLR4 was a target gene of miRNA-31. miRNA-31 is a key role in synovial cells apoptosis induced by RA ( Fig. 7 , Ref. 23).
