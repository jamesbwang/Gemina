  We applied a multiscale approach coupling dissipative particle dynamics method with a drift-diffusion model to elucidate the photovoltaic properties of multiblock copolymers consisting of alternating electron donor and acceptor blocks. A series of hierarchical lamellae-in-lamellar structures were obtained from the self-assembly of the multiblock copolymers. A distinct improvement in photovoltaic performance upon the morphology transformation from lamella to lamellae-in-lamella was observed. The hierarchical lamellae-in-lamellar structures significantly enhanced exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport , which consequently contributed to the improved photovoltaic performance. On the basis of our theoretical calculations , the hierarchical nanostructures can achieve much enhanced energy conversion efficiencies , improved by around 25 % compared with that of general ones , through structure modulation on the number and size of the small-length-scale domains via the molecular design of multiblock copolymers. Our findings are supported by recent experimental evidence and provide guidance for designing advanced photovoltaic materials with hierarchical structures.
