  Epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT) is a phenomenon in which epithelial cells lose their cell to cell adhesion and detach from the base of the membrane. EMT is a fundamental process which occurs during tumor progression and metastasis. Cancer genomics is a complex network which involves a variety of factors such as transcription factors ( TFs) , coding genes and microRNAs ( miRs). Both TFs and miRs are trans-regulatory elements that crosstalk. Due to a wide range of targets , TF-miR interaction provides a feedback or feedforward loop and cross-gene regulation consequently. In this review , we focused on the structure and function of two TF families involved in EMT , zinc finger and Î² helix loop helix and p53. Subsequently we analyzed recent findings on TF-miR interaction in EMT.
