  The aim of this study was to compare the effect of rapeseed and linseed oils added to the diet on pancreatic enzyme activities in sheep. The experiment was conducted on six adult sheep with a catheter introduced into the common bile-pancreatic duct and a T-cannula into the duodenum. The animals were divided into three groups , two sheep in each. A twice-replicated 3 Ã— 3 Latin square was used in the experimental design. The sheep were fed meadow hay and the concentrate alone or the same ration supplemented with rapeseed or linseed oils at a dose of 5 % of the basal diet. After adaptation period , a mixture of pancreatic and bile juice was collected for three consecutive days. The secretion of bile-pancreatic juice showed an increasing trend in sheep fed rapeseed and linseed oils ( 69.5 and 68.5 ml/hr respectively) in comparison with control ones ( 59.8 ml/hr). Lipase and trypsin activities were significantly increased when sheep were fed diets with rapeseed or linseed oils ( 175 and 21.6 or 179 and 23.2 U/L respectively) in comparison with those fed control diet ( 128 and 13.1 U/L respectively). It was concluded that oil as a dietary supplement can mainly modify the secretion of bile-pancreatic juice and enzymatic activity of the pancreas and also might affect animal production.
