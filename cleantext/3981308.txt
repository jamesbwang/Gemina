  It has been documented that aerobic exercise may increase pulmonary functions and aerobic capacity , but limited data has evaluated a child 's satisfaction and pediatric quality of life ( PQoL) with exercise training. This study aimed to investigate the effects of moderate-intensity exercise training on asthmatic school-aged children. This study included 38 school-aged children with asthma ( 23 males and 15 females) aged between 8-12 years. They were randomly assigned to two groups , aerobic exercise ( AE) and conventional treatment ( Con ttt) groups. The AE group received a program of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 10 weeks with asthma medications and the Con ttt group received only asthma medications without exercise intervention. A home respiratory exercise was recommended for the two groups. Aerobic capacity was investigated using maximal oxygen uptake ( VO The findings of this study showed significant improvements in pulmonary functions and VO Ten weeks of physical exercise had beneficial effects on pulmonary functions , aerobic capacity , and PQoL in school-aged children with asthma. Effort and awareness should be dedicated to encouraging the active lifestyle among different populations , especially asthmatic children.
