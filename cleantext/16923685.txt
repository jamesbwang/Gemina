  To determine the extent of physiological variation of uptake of F-flurodeoxyglucose ( FDG) within palatine tonsils. To define normal limits for side-to-side variation and characterize factors affecting tonsillar uptake of FDG.Over a period of 16 weeks 299 adult patients at low risk for head and neck pathology , attending our center for FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT) scans were identified. The maximum standardized uptake value ( SUVmax) was recorded for each palatine tonsil. For each patient age , gender , smoking status , scan indication and prior tonsillectomy status as well as weather conditions were noted.There was a wide variation in palatine tonsil FDG uptake with SUVmax values between 1.3 and 11.4 recorded. There was a strong left to right correlation for tonsillar FDG uptake within each patient ( P < .01). The right palatine tonsil showed increased FDG uptake ( 4.63) compared to the left ( 4.47) ( P < .01). In multivariate analysis , gender , scan indication , and prevailing weather had no significant impact of tonsillar FDG uptake. Lower tonsillar uptake was seen in patients with a prior history of tonsillectomy ( 4.13) than those without this history ( 4.64) ( P < .01). Decreasing tonsillar FDG uptake was seen with advancing age ( P < .01). Significantly lower uptake was seen in current smokers ( SUVmax 4.2) than nonsmokers ( SUV 4.9) ( P = .03). Uptake of FDG in palatine tonsils is variable but shows a strong side-to-side correlation. We suggest the left/ right SUVmax ratio as a guide to normality with a first to 99th percentiles of ( 0.70-1.36) for use in patients not suspected to have tonsillar pathology.
