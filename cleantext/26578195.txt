  Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI) has become the standard treatment for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis ( AS) considered at very high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. The purpose of this sub-study was to evaluate long-term ( > 4 years) health-related quality of life ( QoL) in octogenarians who underwent TAVI. A single center observational registry in twenty patients who underwent frame analysis assessment ≥ 4 years after TAVI. Health-related QoL was evaluated , using the Short Form-36 ( SF-36) , the EuroQoL-5D ( EQ-5D) and the visual analogue score ( EQ-VAS) questionnaires. The mean SF-36 subscale scores at follow-up were physical functioning 40.8 ± 26.3 , role physical functioning 67.7 ± 34.9 , vitality 54.6 ± 21.6 , general health 52.1 ± 20.4 , social functioning 63.8 ± 37.7 , role emotional functioning 70.2 ± 36.0 , mental health 73.2 ± 23.3 and bodily pain 80.9 ± 22.9. The mean EQ-VAS score > 4 years after TAVI was 64.7 ± 15.1. With respect to functional class , 80 % of the patients were in NYHA class I/II at follow-up compared to 15 % prior to TAVI. This sub-study reports a significant improvement in functional class ( NYHA) in a selected group of very elderly patients > 4 years after TAVI. Furthermore , all patients showed a satisfactory QoL despite their age and multiple comorbidities. In addition , our study reveals a lower QoL when compared with the general age matched Dutch population.
