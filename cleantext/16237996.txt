  In this paper , we carry out researches on randomized local binary features. Randomized local binary features have been used in many methods like RandomForests , RandomFerns , BRIEF , ORB and AKAZE to matching keypoints. However , in those existing methods , the randomness of feature operators only reflects in sampling position. In this paper , we find the quality of the binary feature space can be greatly improved by increasing the randomness of the basic sampling operator. The key idea of our method is to use a Randomized Intensity Difference operator ( we call it RID operator) as a basic sampling operator to observe image patches. The randomness of RID operators are reflected in five aspects: grids , position , aperture , weights and channels. Comparing with the traditional incompletely randomized binary features ( we call them RIT features) , a completely randomized sampling manner can generate higher quality binary feature space. The RID operator can be used on both gray and color images. We embed different kinds of RID operators into RandomFerns and RandomForests classifiers to test their recognition rate on both image and video datasets. The experiment results show the excellent quality of our feature method. We also propose the evaluation criteria for robustness and distinctiveness to observe the effects of randomization on binary feature space.
