  Although schizencephaly belongs to the class of neurodevelopmental disorders , which are a well-known predisposing factor for psychosis , there is a lack of relevant studies and diagnostic guidelines on this relationship. A case report of first-episode psychosis with persistent negative symptoms associated with schizencephaly is described and compared with 7 other cases found in the literature. We found perinatal pathology , cognitive deficit , and EEG abnormality in a patient with atypical initial symptoms of psychosis such as olfactory hallucinations. Abnormal EEG findings ( left frontal spikes and frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) called for magnetic resonance imaging , which revealed left parieto-occipital closed-lip schizencephaly. The patient exhibited a partial response to low-dose amisulpride treatment. We conclude that schizencephaly in our patient was at first asymptomatic and later developed into clinically manifest schizophrenia-like disorder. Both magnetic resonance imaging and EEG were essential tools for establishing this diagnosis.
