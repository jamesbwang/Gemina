  Extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK)/ mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK) signaling pathway is widely involved in cell proliferation and invasion regulation. Enhanced expression or function of ERK1 is important for leukemia<disease>. Abnormal down-regulation of microRNA ( miR) -143 is correlated with leukemia<disease> pathogenesis , indicating possible tumor-suppressing role. Bioinformatics analysis showed the existence of complementary binding sites between miR-143 and ERK1. This study aims to investigate whether the miR-143 plays a role in mediating ERK1 expression and proliferation and apoptosis of leukemia<disease> cells. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed targeted regulation between miR-143 and ERK1. Quantitative RT-PCR ( qRT-PCR) was used to measure and compare the peripheral miR-143 and ERK1 expression between healthy and acute promyelocytic leukemia<disease> ( APL) patients to analyze the effect of miR-143 and MEK1 on survival and prognosis. Cultured HL-60 cells were treated with miR-143 mimic or small interfering RNA ( siRNA)- ERK1 , followed by qRT-PCR to measure miR-143 expression. Western blot quantified expression of ERK1 and p-ERK1 , flow cytometry measured apoptosis , and EdU staining measured proliferation. MiR-143 targeted and modulated ERK1. APL patients presented lower miR-143 and higher ERK1 in peripheral blood. Those with miR-143 down-regulation displayed worse prognosis than those with high miR-143 expression ( χ2 = 5.198 , p = 0.039). Patients with ERK1 mRNA low-expression presented better prognosis than those a having higher expression ( Log-rank test , χ2 = 5.873 , p = 0.028). Transfection of miR-143 mimic or siRNA-ERK1 remarkably suppressed ERK1 and p-ERK1 expression in HL-60 cells , inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. MiR-143 down-regulation and ERK1 up-regulation are correlated with APL pathogenesis. Their expression level affected patient 's prognosis. MiR-143 targeted and inhibited ERK1 expression , weakened proliferation potency of HL-60 cells , and induced apoptosis.
