  ERAS protocols were developed for colorectal surgery to hasten post-op recovery. Variations of the protocol are being adopted for gynecologic procedures despite limited population and procedure-specific outcome data. Our objective was to evaluate if implementation of an ERAS pathway would facilitate reduced length of admission in an urogynecology population. In this retrospective analysis of patients undergoing pelvic floor reconstructive surgery by 7 female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgeons we compared same day discharge , length of admission and post-op complications before and after implementation of an ERAS pathway at a tertiary-care hospital. Groups were compared using χ2 and t-tests. Candidate variables that could impact patient outcomes with p < .2 were included in multivariable logistic regression models. Satisfaction with surgical experience was assessed using a phone administered questionnaire the day after discharge. Mean age and BMI of 258 women ( 137 pre-ERAS and 121 ERAS) were 65.5 ± 11.3 years and 28.2 ± 5.0 kg/m ERAS implementation in an urogynecology population resulted in a greater proportion of same day discharge and high patient satisfaction but with slightly increased hospital readmissions within 30 days.
