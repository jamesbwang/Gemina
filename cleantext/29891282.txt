  Inspired by the presence of diverse carbohydrates on the surface of biological systems , we present herein a method for the synthesis of sugar-bearing polymers derived from renewable cellulose. In this paper , novel glycosylated cellulose derivatives were successfully synthesized containing a series of subsequent reactions: ( 1) synthesis of cellulose derivatives with pendant hydroxyl groups via nucleophilic substitution; ( 2) further sequential reactions containing a novel TEMPO/ ( bis ( acetoxy) iodo) benzene ( BAIB)- mediated oxidation of pendant hydroxyl groups , Schiff base formation and reduction in one-pot reaction; and ( 3) thiol-ene click reaction as an efficient tool to generate cellulose derivatives with pendant glucosyl groups. Furthermore , the glucosyl groups were only linked with the C6 position of anhydroglucose units ( AGUs) of cellulose. Moreover , the glycosylated cellulose derivatives could be reversibly cross-linked by 1,4-phenylenediboronic acid at pH 10 and dissociated into single polymer chains by using glucose , which allow such glycolated cellulose derivatives to be interesting responsive materials.
