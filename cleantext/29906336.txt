  The electron-rich isonitrile is an important functionality in bioactive natural products , but its biosynthesis has been restricted to the IsnA family of isonitrile synthases. We herein provide the first structural and biochemical evidence of an alternative mechanism for isonitrile formation. ScoE , a putative non-heme iron ( II)- dependent enzyme from Streptomyces<pathogen> coeruleorubidus , was shown to catalyze the conversion of ( R) -3- ( ( carboxymethyl) amino) butanoic acid to ( R) -3-isocyanobutanoic acid through an oxidative decarboxylation mechanism. This work further provides a revised scheme for the biosynthesis of a unique class of isonitrile lipopeptides , of which several members are critical for the virulence of pathogenic mycobacteria.
