  Meeting the needs of patients who experience physical pain and a psychiatric illness presents challenges as well as opportunities to optimize collaborative partnerships between specialty and primary care services. It is imperative that patients with pain be evaluated for depression<symptom> and those who present with depression<symptom> be evaluated for pain to prevent chronic opiate overuse. Given the overlap in symptomatology patients can present in either primary care or psychiatric care , an understanding of the comorbid presentation and lived experience of these patients is essential to holistic and complementary care. The current article examines the nature of pain and comorbid depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> along with suggested treatment modalities that can modify psychological processes and behavior that perpetuate the pain experience and increase need for opiate medication.
