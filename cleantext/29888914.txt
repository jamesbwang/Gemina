  A cyano-bridged Fe ( II)- Cr ( III) single-chain magnet designed to ensure a parallel orientation of the axial anisotropy of the building units is reported. This ferromagnetic chain compound consists of a pentagonal bipyramid Fe ( II) complex<pathogen> with Ising-type anisotropy and a dicyanide Cr ( III) complex interlinked through their apical positions. It is characterized by an energy gap for the magnetization reversal of Î”
