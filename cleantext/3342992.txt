  Elder mistreatment is a well-recognized public health issue with complex underlying factors. The current study hypothesized that there is no effect of any of the following factors on any type of elder mistreatment: ethnicity , age group , education status , gender , living arrangement , concentration problems , medication for any disease , income level of caregiver , use of alcohol and tobacco products , and dependence on family or caregivers for daily activities. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 339 elders adults aged 60 or above residing in a rural part of eastern Nepal between August and November 2016. Multi-stage cluster sampling was adopted to select the study subjects. Information was collected using semi-structured questionnaires administered to elderly people by a designated interviewer. Factors associated with elder mistreatment were analyzed using logistic regression. Our findings revealed that 61.7 % of 60 +- year-olds experienced some form of mistreatment ( physical 2.4 % , psychological 22.4 % , caregiver neglect 57.5 % , financial 12.1 % and stranger-inflicted 8.3 %). Elder mistreatment was associated with the following characteristics of elders: dependent on family for daily living activities , illiterate , experiencing concentration problems , residing in a living arrangement with their son ( s)/ daughter ( s)- in-law , taking regular medications , belonging to the Dalit community according to the Hindu traditional caste system , and residing with a caregiver having a monthly family income of less than NRs. 20,000 ( 193 USD). Our data show that elder mistreatment is prevalent in a rural community of Nepal. Addressing the lower socio-economic or socio-cultural classes of caregivers and elders via community-focused development programs might have significant implications for improving the well-being of elders.
