  Creative problem solving involves search processes , and it is known to be hard to motivate. Reward cues have been found to enhance performance across a range of tasks , even when cues are presented subliminally , without being consciously detected. It is uncertain whether motivational processes , such as reward , can influence problem solving. We tested the effect of supraliminal and subliminal reward on participant performance on problem solving that can be solved by deliberate analysis or by insight. Forty-one participants attempted to solve 100 compound remote associate problems. At the beginning of each problem , a potential reward cue ( 1 or 25 cents) was displayed , either subliminally ( 17 ms) or supraliminally ( 100 ms). Participants earned the displayed reward if they solved the problem correctly. Results showed that the higher subliminal reward increased the percentage of problems solved correctly overall. Second , we explored if subliminal rewards preferentially influenced solutions that were achieved via a sudden insight ( mostly processed below awareness) or via a deliberate analysis. Participants solved more problems via insight following high subliminal reward when compared with low subliminal reward , and compared with high supraliminal reward , with no corresponding effect on analytic solving. Striatal dopamine ( DA) is thought to influence motivation , reinforce behavior , and facilitate cognition. We speculate that subliminal rewards activate the striatal DA system , enhancing the kinds of automatic integrative processes that lead to more creative strategies for problem solving , without increasing the selectivity of attention , which could impede insight.
