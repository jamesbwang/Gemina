  Oral cavity cancer is a type of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) and contributes to significant morbidity and mortality each year. An epigenetic pathway of transcriptional inactivation for many genes has been described in various cancers , including HNSCC. For our study , we selected genes for which silencing caused by hypermethylation can promote cancer development. In 75 primary HNSCC tumours and paired surgical margins , we investigated the methylation status of the
