  To test the hypothesis that abnormal corpus callosum ( CC) induced by diabetes may impair inter-hemispheric sensorimotor functional connectivity ( FC) that is associated with poor clinical outcome after stroke. Forty-five patients with acute ischaemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory and 14 normal controls participated in the study. CC was divided into five subregions on three-dimensional T1-weighted image. The microstructural integrity of each subregion of CC was analysed by DTI and the inter-hemispheric FCs in primary motor cortex ( M1-M1 FC) and primary sensory cortex ( S1-S1 FC) were examined by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Diabetic patients ( n = 26) had significantly lower fractional anisotropy ( FA) in the isthmus of CC ( CC CC degeneration induced by diabetes impairs sensorimotor connectivity and dysfunction of motor connectivity can contribute to poor recovery after stroke in patients with diabetes. • Abnormal isthmus of corpus callosum in stroke patients with diabetes. • Abnormal isthmus of corpus callosum correlated with decreased inter-hemispheric sensorimotor connectivity. • Decreased motor connectivity correlated with poor stroke outcome in diabetic patients.
