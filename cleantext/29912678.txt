  This study aimed to estimate the consumption of meat and products derived from hunting by the consumer population and , specifically , by hunters and their relatives. For this purpose , a survey was conducted on the frequency of consuming meat from the four most representative game species in Spain , two of big game , wild boar ( Sus scrofa) and red deer ( Cervus elaphus) , and two of small game , rabbit ( Oryctolagus cuniculus) and red partridge ( Alectoris rufa) , as well as of processed meat products ( salami-type sausage) made from those big game species. The survey was carried out on 337 habitual consumers of these types of products ( hunters and their relatives). The total mean game meat consumption , per capita in this population group , is 6.87 kg/person/year of meat and 8.57 kg/person/year if the processed meat products are also considered. Consumption of rabbit , red partridge , red deer and wild boar , individually , was 1.85 , 0.82 , 2.28 and 1.92 kg/person/year , respectively. It was observed that hunters generally registered a larger intake of game meat , this being statistically significant in the case of rabbit meat consumption. Using probabilistic methods , the meat consumption frequency distributions for each hunting species studied were estimated , as well as the products made from big game species and the total consumption both of meat by itself and that including the products made from it. The consumption frequency distributions were adjusted to exponential ones , verified by the test suitable for it according to Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC) , Bayesian Information Criterion ( BIC) , the Chi-squared and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics. In addition , the consumption percentiles of the different distributions were obtained. The latter could be a good tool when making nutrition or contaminant studies since they permit the assessment of exposure to the compound in question.
