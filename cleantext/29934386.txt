  To determine whether changes in emergency admission rates during transition from paediatric to adult hospital services differed in children and young people ( CYP) with and without underlying long-term conditions ( LTCs). Cross-sectional study. Emergency admissions between 2009 and 2011 recorded in the Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care data in England. 763 199 CYP aged 10-24 years with and without underlying LTCs ( LTCs were defined using the International Classification of Diseases , 10th Revision codes recorded in the past 5 years). We calculated emergency admission rates before ( 10-15 years) and after transition ( 19-24 years) , stratified by gender , LTC and primary diagnosis. We used negative binomial regression to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios ( IRRs). We included 1 109 978 emergency admissions , of which 63.2 % were in children with LTCs. The emergency admission rate increased across the age of transition for all CYP , more so for those with LTCs ( IRR The increased rates and duration of emergency admissions and predominance of non-specific admission diagnoses during transition in CYP with underlying LTCs may reflect unmet physical or mental health needs.
