  Myopia occurs in more than 50 % of the population in many industrialized countries and is expected to increase; complications associated with axial elongation from myopia are the sixth leading cause of blindness<symptom>. Thus , understanding its etiology , epidemiology , and the results of various treatment regiments may modify current care and result in a reduction in morbidity from progressive myopia. This rapid increase can not be explained by genetics alone. Current animal and human research demonstrates that myopia development is a result of the interplay between genetic and the environmental factors. The prevalence of myopia is higher in individuals whose both parents are myopic , suggesting that genetic factors are clearly involved in myopia development. At the same time , population studies suggest that development of myopia is associated with education and the amount time spent doing near work; hence , activities increase the exposure to optical blur. Recently , there has been an increase in efforts to slow the progression of myopia because of its relationship to the development of serious pathological conditions such as macular degeneration , retinal detachments , glaucoma , and cataracts. We reviewed meta-analysis and other of current treatments that include: atropine , progressive addition spectacle lenses , orthokeratology , and multifocal contact lenses.
