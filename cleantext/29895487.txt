  We aimed to investigate the performance of virtual functional assessment of coronary stenoses using intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS)- based three-dimensional ( 3D) coronary artery reconstruction against the invasively measured fractional flow reserve ( FFR). Twenty-two patients with either typical symptoms of stable angina or a positive stress test , who underwent IVUS and FFR , were included in this study. Five patients presented FFR values lower than the 0.80 threshold , indicating ischaemia. IVUS-based 3D reconstruction and blood flow simulation were performed and the virtual functional assessment index ( vFAI) was calculated. A strong correlation between IVUS-based vFAI and FFR was observed ( Spearman correlation coefficient ( r The proposed approach allows the complete and comprehensive assessment of coronary stenoses providing anatomic and physiologic information , pre- and post-intervention , using only an IVUS catheter without the use of a pressure wire.
