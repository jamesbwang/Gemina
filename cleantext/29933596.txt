  Anomalies on road pavement cause discomfort to drivers and passengers , and may cause mechanical failure or even accidents. Governments spend millions of Euros every year on road maintenance , often causing traffic jams and congestion<symptom> on urban roads on a daily basis. This paper analyses the difference between the deployment of a road anomalies detection and identification system in a & ldquo; conditioned & rdquo; and a real world setup , where the system performed worse compared to the & ldquo; conditioned & rdquo; setup. It also presents a system performance analysis based on the analysis of the training data sets; on the analysis of the attributes complexity , through the application of PCA techniques; and on the analysis of the attributes in the context of each anomaly type , using acceleration standard deviation attributes to observe how different anomalies classes are distributed in the Cartesian coordinates system. Overall , in this paper , we describe the main insights on road anomalies detection challenges to support the design and deployment of a new iteration of our system towards the deployment of a road anomaly detection service to provide information about roads condition to drivers and government entities.
