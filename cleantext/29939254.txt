  Adalimumab has been shown to be more effective than placebo in healing fistulae<disease> in adults with moderately to severely active Crohn 's disease. The efficacy and safety of adalimumab in healing fistulae<disease> in children/adolescents with Crohn 's disease from the 52-week IMAgINE 1 clinical trial , and its open-label extension IMAgINE 2 , are reported. Children/adolescents with perianal fistulae<disease> at baseline of IMAgINE 1 were assessed for fistula<disease> closure and improvement during IMAgINE 1 ( Week 0-52) and from Week 0 of IMAgINE 2 ( Week 52 of IMAgINE 1) through to Week 240 of IMAgINE 2 using non-responder imputation. A total of 36 children/adolescents had fistulae<disease> at baseline of IMAgINE 1 and were included in the analysis. Fistula<disease> closure and improvement were observed in 44.4 % and 52.8 % , respectively , at Week 12. Rates of closure and improvement were maintained throughout the analysis period to Week 292. No new safety signals were identified. In children/adolescents with moderately to severely active , fistulising Crohn 's disease , adalimumab induced perianal fistula<disease> closure and improvement within 12 weeks of treatment , with rates that were sustained for more than 5 years. The safety profile of adalimumab in patients with fistulae<disease> at baseline was similar to that of the overall population in IMAgINE 1/2.
