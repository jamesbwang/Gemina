  In recent years there has been a marked decrease in cardiac glycosides use in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> in sinus rhythm and atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom>. The results of published studies contradict each other. Some of them doubt the favorable effect of digoxin in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom>; others refute the increase in the lethality and frequency of hospitalizations associated with the use of digoxin. In this regard , we found it important to analyze these reports impartially and reflect modern views on the mechanisms of cardiac glycosides , the pharmacokinetics and the possibility of optimizing digitalis therapy in cardiac practice.
