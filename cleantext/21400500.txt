  IL-10 is a potent immunosuppressive cytokine that promotes the differentiation of tolerogenic dendritic cells ( DC-10) , and the subsequent induction of antigen-specific T regulatory type 1 ( Tr1) cells , which suppress immune responses. However , IL-10 acts on multiple cell types and its effects are not solely inhibitory , therefore , limiting its use as immunomodulant. APVO210 is a bispecific fusion protein composed of an anti-CD86 antibody fused with monomeric IL-10 ( ADAPTIR â„¢ from Aptevo Therapeutics). APVO210 specifically induces IL-10R signaling in CD86
