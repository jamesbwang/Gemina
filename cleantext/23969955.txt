  Noninvasive tests to diagnose and monitor the progression of neurodegenerative disorders have been a challenge for decades. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of applying liquid biopsy procedures to patients with a neurodegenerative disease such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS). We isolated plasma cell-free DNA ( cfDNA) in 20 ALS patients and 20 controls and used cfDNA to identify a novel differentially methylated mark in
