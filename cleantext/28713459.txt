  The bench press ( BP) is a complex exercise demanding high neuromuscular activity. Therefore , the main objective of this study was to identify the patterns of muscular activity of the prime movers on both sides of an elite powerlifter. A World Champion ( RAW PR 320 kg) participated in the study ( age: 34 years; body mass: 103 kg; body height 1.72 m; one-repetition maximum ( 1 RM) flat bench press: 220 kg). The subject performed one repetition of the flat bench press with: 70 % 1 RM ( 150 kg) and 90 % 1 RM ( 200 kg) in tempos: 2 s eccentric and 1 s concentric phase; 6 s eccentric and 1 s concentric phase). The activity was recorded for: pectoralis major , anterior deltoid<symptom> , and triceps brachii ( lateral and long head). The total sum of peak muscle activity for the four analyzed muscles during both phases of the BP with the different loads and tempos was significantly different , and greater on the right side of the body. The use of lighter loads activate muscle groups in a different activation level , allowing for a greater muscle control. Lifting submaximal and maximal loads causes an activation of most motor units involved in the movement. Experienced athletes have a stabilized neuromuscular pattern for lifting which has different bilateral activity contribution.
