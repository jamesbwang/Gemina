  Bacteria use various endogenous antioxidants for protection against oxidative stress associated with environmental survival or host infection. Although glutathione ( GSH) is the most abundant and widely used antioxidant in Proteobacteria , ergothioneine ( EGT) is another microbial antioxidant , mainly produced by fungi<pathogen> and Actinobacteria. The Burkholderia<pathogen> genus is found in diverse environmental niches. We observed that gene homologs required for the synthesis of EGT are widely distributed throughout the genus. By generating gene-deletion mutants and monitoring production with isotope-labeled substrates , we show that pathogenic Burkholderia<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> and environmental B. thailandensis are able to synthesize EGT de novo. Unlike most other bacterial EGT synthesis pathways described , Burkholderia<pathogen> spp. use cysteine rather than Î³-glutamyl cysteine as the thiol donor. Analysis of recombinant EgtB indicated that it is a proficient sulfoxide synthase , despite divergence in the active site architecture from that of mycobacteria. The absence of GSH , but not EGT , increased bacterial susceptibility to oxidative stresses in vitro. However , deletion of EGT synthesis conferred a reduced fitness to B.<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> , with a delay in organ colonization and time to death during mouse infection. Therefore , despite the lack of an apparent antioxidant role in vitro , EGT is important for optimal bacterial pathogenesis in the mammalian host.-Gamage , A. M. , Liao , C. , Cheah , I.

The proteobacterial species Burkholderia<pathogen> pseudomallei<pathogen> produces ergothioneine , which enhances virulence in mammalian infection.
