  The autoimmune rheumatological diseases rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) , spondyloarthritis ( SpA) and systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) are treated with conventional immunosuppressive agents and with modern biological immunomodulators. The latter group of medications have brought about a major change in our ability to control RA and SpA , with more modest results for SLE. The biologicals are very specific in their mechanisms of action , targeting one specific cytokine or one particular cellular marker. Because of this , their efficacy can readily be linked to a single immunomodulatory mechanism. This observation has fuelled hopes that the efficacy of these agents can be predicted at the individual level based on the patient 's genetic predisposition , immunological profile or disease phenotype. Whilst the biologic therapies have improved the prospects for patients with these diseases very significantly , the hope that they could be targeted to the patient in an individualized manner has not completely born fruit. In this review , I will argue that we are witnessing important progress in this field , and that justified hope exists for true advances in precision medicine in the autoimmune diseases in the coming years.
