  The objective of this study was to explore how health professionals perceived the effect of the economic crisis and associated austerity measures on the detection of and cares for intimate partner violence ( IPV) in primary care in Spain. Qualitative study designed using semi-structured interviews carried out with 145 health professionals in 16 primary health care centres in different regions of Spain. An inductive thematic analysis was made of the transcriptions. Three main themes were identified: ` Women endure more violence during times of economic crisis ' , ` Fewer resources , fewer professionals and less time to respond to IPV ' and ` Professionals ' motivation as a requirement to respond to IPV '. Professionals perceived that economic precariousness triggered violence against women and made women more hesitant to put an end to violent relationships. They also reported that the austerity measures applied to primary health care negatively affected their ability to detect and adequately care for cases of IPV due to a heavy workload , reduced human resources , difficulties in training and the loss of resources to which women could be referred. To counteract these obstacles , health professionals ' motivation played a vital role in the response to IPV. Institutional efforts to organize awareness programmes and training in order to improve and promote early diagnosis , care and rehabilitation of these women can not stop during times of crisis and primary health care centres should facilitate health professionals ' access to these programmes.
