  Many studies examined predictors of depressive relapse/recurrence but no simple tool based on well-established risk factors is available that estimates the risk within an individual. We developed and validated such a prediction tool in remitted recurrently depressed individuals. The tool was developed using data ( n = 235) from a pragmatic randomised controlled trial in remitted recurrently depressed participants and externally validated using data ( n = 209) from a similar randomised controlled trial of remitted recurrently depressed participants using maintenance antidepressants. Cox regression was used with time to relapse/recurrence within 2 years as outcome and well-established risk factors as predictors. Performance measures and absolute risk scores were calculated , a practically applicable risk score was created , and the tool was externally validated. The 2-year cumulative proportion relapse/recurrence was 46.2 % in the validation dataset. The tool included number of previous depressive episodes , residual depressive symptoms , severity of the last depressive episode , and treatment. The C-statistic and calibration slope were 0.56 and 0.81 respectively. The tool stratified participants into relapse/recurrence risk classes of 37 % , 55 % , and 72 %. The C-statistic and calibration slope in the external validation were 0.59 and 0.56 respectively , and Kaplan Meier curves showed that the tool could differentiate between risk classes. This is the first study that developed a simple prediction tool based on well-established risk factors of depressive relapse/recurrence , estimating the individual risk. Since the overall performance of the model was poor , more studies are needed to enhance the performance before recommending implementation into clinical practice.
