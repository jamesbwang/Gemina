  Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia- an Overview Abstract. Negative symptoms in schizophrenia comprise the symptom-dimensions of apathy ( avolition , anhedonia and social withdrawal) and reduced expression ( alogia and blunted affect). Negative symptoms are of a high relevance for the illness course , since they strongly affect functional outcome and quality of life. A diagnostic differentiation is recommended in primary negative symptoms ( regarded as an integral part of schizophrenia) and secondary negative symptoms ( regarded as a result of positive symptoms , comorbid depression<symptom> , effects of antipsychotic medication , substance abuse or social deprivation). The following overview will present the various aspects of negative symptoms , the underlying pathophysiology and describe current diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations based on the concept of primary and secondary negative symptoms.
