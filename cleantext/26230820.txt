  The family of materials defined as ZrSiX ( X = S , Se , Te) has been established as Dirac node-line semimetals , and subsequent study is urgent to exploit the promising applications of unusual magnetoresistance ( MR) properties. Herein , we systematically investigated the anisotropic MR in the newly-discovered Dirac node-line material ZrSiSe. By applying a magnetic field of 3 T by a vector field , three-dimensional ( 3D) MR shows the strong anisotropy. The MR ratio of maximum and minimum directions reaches 7 at 3 T and keeps increasing at the higher magnetic field. The anisotropic MR forms a butterfly-shaped curve , indicating the quasi-2D electronic structures. This is further confirmed by the angular dependent Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. The first-principles calculations establish the quasi-2D tubular-shaped Fermi surface near the X point in the Brillouin zone. Our finding sheds light on the 3D mapping of MR and the potential applications in magnetic sensors based on ZrSiSe.
