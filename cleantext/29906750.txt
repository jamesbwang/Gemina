  The effects of naringenin; a dietary flavonoid , with potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities on social defeat stress ( SDS)- induced neurobehavioral and biochemical changes were evaluated in mice using resident-intruder paradigm. The intruder male mice were distributed into 6 groups ( n = 6). Mice in group 1 ( control) received vehicle ( 3 % DMSO , i.p) , group 2 ( SDS-control) were also given vehicle , groups 3-5 received naringenin ( 10 , 25 and 50 mg/kg , i.p.) while group 6 had ginseng ( 50 mg/kg , i.p) daily for 14 days. However , 30 min after treatment on day 7 , mice in groups 2-6 were exposed to SDS for a period of 10 min confrontation with aggressive counterparts for 7 consecutive days. Neurobehavioral phenotypes: spontaneous motor activity ( SMA) , memory , anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> were then evaluated on day 14. Malondialdehyde ( MDA) , glutathione ( GSH) , catalase and superoxide dismutase ( SOD) were then estimated in the brain tissues. Acetylcholinesterase ( AChE) activity and the concentrations of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha ( TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta ( IL-1β) were also determined. SDS-induced neurobehavioral deficits were significantly ( p < 0.05) attenuated by naringenin. The increased brain level of MDA ( 13.00 ± 0.63 μmol/g tissue) relative to vehicle-control ( 6.50 ± 0.43 μmol/g tissue) was significantly ( p < 0.05) reduced to 5.50 ± 0.22 μmol/g tissue by naringenin ( 50 mg/kg). Mice exposed to SDS had decreased brain GSH level ( 5.17 ± 0.40 μmol/g tissue) relative to control ( 11.67 ± 0.84 μmol/g tissue). However , naringenin ( 50 mg/kg) significantly ( p < 0.05) elevated GSH content ( 13.33 ± 0.88 μmol/g tissue) in the brains of SDS-mice. Moreover , 50 mg/Kg of naringenin ( 38.13 ± 2.38 ρg/mL) attenuated ( p < 0.05) increased TNF-α level when compared with SDS ( 49.69 ± 2.81 ρg/mL). SDS-induced increase in brain level of IL-1β ( 236.5 ± 6.92 ρg/mL) was significantly ( p < 0.05) reduced by naringenin ( 219.90 ± 15.25 ρg/mL). Naringenin also elevated antioxidant enzymes and decreased AChE activity in the brains of mice exposed to SDS ( p < 0.05). These findings suggest that naringenin attenuates SDS-induced neurobehavioral deficits through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity , oxidative stress and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
