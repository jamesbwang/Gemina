  The activity of a neural network is a result of synaptic signals that convey the communication between neurons and neuron-based intrinsic currents that determine the neuron 's input-output transfer function. Ample studies demonstrate that cell-based excitability , and in particular intrinsic excitability , is modulated by learning , and that these modifications play a key role in learning related behavioral changes. The field of cell-based plasticity is largely growing and it entails numerous experimental findings that demonstrate a large diversity of currents that are affected by learning. The diverse effect of learning on the neuron 's excitability emphasize the need for a framework under which cell-based plasticity can be categorized to enable the assessment of the computational roles of the intrinsic modifications. We divide the domain of cell-based plasticity into three main categories , where the first category entails the currents that mediate the passive properties and single spike generation. The second category entails the currents that mediate spike frequency adaptation and the third category entails a novel learning induced mechanism where all excitatory and inhibitory synapses double their strength. Curiously , this elementary division enabled a natural categorization of the computational roles of these learning induced plasticity. The computational roles are diverse and include modification of the neuronal mode of action like bursting , prolonged and fast responsive; attention-like effect where the signal detection is improved; transfer of the network into an active state; biasing the competition for memory allocation; transforming an environmental cue into a dominant cue and enabling a quicker formation of new memories.
