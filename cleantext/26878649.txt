  The factors that predispose to pulmonary tuberculosis<disease> ( PTB) are not fully understood. Previous studies have shown that cytokine gene polymorphisms were associated with PTB. In this study , we have investigated the relationship between A total of 209 cases of PTB , 201 subjects with latent TB infection ( LTBI) , and 204 healthy controls ( HCS) were included in this study. Logistic regression analyses under allelic , homozygous , and heterozygous models were used to calculate When comparing PTB patients with LTBI subjects , significant associations with disease development were observed for SNPs of Our study demonstrated that
