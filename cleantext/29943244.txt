  In this work , fodder radish seed cake ( FRSC) was pyrolyzed in a rotary kiln reactor at 0 , 3 , and 6 rpm , at final temperature of 500 °C. Maximum biochar yield was observed at 0 rpm ( ≈ 26 wt. %). Increase of the rotary speed decreased the volatile matter content and increased the ash content of the biochars. Biochars exhibited alkaline pH ( ≈ 9.0) , low electrical conductivity ( < 105.6 dS m
