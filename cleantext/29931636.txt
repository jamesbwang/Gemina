  Heavy metal contamination in sediments is progressively being recognized as a challenging problem in large parts of the developing world , particularly in Asian countries. A drinking water lake in Yunnan-Guizhou plateau , China named Hongfeng Lake was selected as the research target. Forty surface sediment samples and 4 sediment cores were collected to reveal the accumulation of heavy metals in the sediments of the lake. The mean concentrations of Cr , Cu , Pb , Cd , As , and Hg in surface sediments were 81.67 , 45.61 , 29.78 , 0.53 , 22.71 , and 0.25 mg/kg , respectively , which exceeded the background levels of sediment 1.1 ~ 3.3 times. The calculation of geoaccumulation ( I
