  Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide ( NTCP , SLC10A1) was recently identified as a hepatocyte receptor for infection of Hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>). The natural S267F variant in NTCP causes a loss of HBV receptor function of NTCP. We assessed the association of S267F with HBV resistance , HBV infection clearance , and HBV-related cirrhosis and HCC. We tested the effects of S267F in 1117 Han Chinese patients with various HBV<pathogen> infection outcomes using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The frequency of S267F ( T allele) was higher in HBV-resistance healthy controls ( n = 179 , 4.0 %) compared to HBV-infected patients ( n = 648 , 1.5 %) , with odds ratio ( OR) 0.32 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.15-0.68) , p = 0.003 ( dominant model). The 267F variant genotypes were also associated with reduced risk for cirrhosis ( n = 192 , 0.5 %) and HCC ( n = 258 , 1.0 % compared to those with chronic HBV<pathogen> infection ( n = 202 , 3.0 %) , with OR 0.15 ( 0.03-0.70) and OR 0.21 ( 0.062-0.72) , respectively. There was no association of the S267F variant with spontaneous HBV clearance. Carriage of the S267F variant for the HBV cell-entry receptor NTCP was associated with increased resistance to HBV infection and decreased risk of development of cirrhosis and liver cancer among those with chronic HBV<pathogen> infection.
