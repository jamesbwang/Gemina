  The stepwise approach takes advantage of simple , versatile , low-cost screening tools that can be applied to several posts of the saffron trade chain to specifically detect adulteration with carminic acid ( CA). This natural dye is of insect origin and should not be present in Kosher and Halal foods such as saffron. For gross adulteration levels ( > 25.0 % , w/w) reaction with diphenylamine-sulfuric acid was found adequate to indicate the presence of extraneous matter but not its identity. FT-IR analysis of the dry material combined with chemometrics served to rapidly sort out samples containing > 10.0 % CA without any sample pretreatment except grinding. Aqueous extracts prepared according to ISO 3632-2 were then examined by tristimulus colorimetry and derivative UV-Vis spectrometry to detect adulteration down to the level of 2.0 % ( w/w). Determination of CA down to 0.2 % , w/w was achieved by RP-HPLC-DAD using aqueous acetonitrile elution solvent ( pH = 2.8).
