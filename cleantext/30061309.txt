  Hepatic veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome<disease> ( VOD/SOS) is a potentially life-threatening complication of conditioning during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT) or chemotherapy without HSCT , with a historically reported mean incidence of 13.7 % post-HSCT. Typical symptoms of VOD/SOS may include hyperbilirubinemia , painful hepatomegaly , weight gain , and ascites. Defibrotide , a polydisperse mixture of predominantly single-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides , is currently the only therapy approved to treat hepatic VOD/SOS with pulmonary/renal dysfunction ( ie , multiorgan dysfunction/multiorgan failure ( MOD/MOF)) following HSCT in the United States and to treat severe hepatic VOD/SOS post-HSCT in the European Union. In preclinical and human studies , defibrotide has demonstrated profibrinolytic , antithrombotic , anti-inflammatory , and angio-protective actions , thus promoting an anticoagulant phenotype of the endothelium that protects and stabilizes the function of endothelial cells. In a phase 3 , historically controlled , multicenter trial in adults and children with VOD/SOS and MOD/MOF ( defibrotide: n = 102; controls treated before defibrotide availability: n = 32) , defibrotide resulted in significantly greater day +100 survival following HSCT ( 38.2 %) vs controls ( 25.0 %; propensity analysis-estimated between-group difference: 23 %;
