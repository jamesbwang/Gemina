  Recent literature has focused on the association of psoriasis with lower than normal or highly deficient vitamin D blood levels.To investigate the controversial association between psoriasis and vitamin D levels.From 2012 to 2014 , 561 subjects were assessed , of which 170 had psoriasis , 51 had an autoimmune bullous , and 340 were healthy patients. Anagraphical data , 25 ( OH) D blood levels , and seasons of vitamin D levels assessments were recorded for each group.Vitamin D levels were significantly different among the 3 groups ( K = 151.284; P = .0001). Psoriatic patients had significantly lower serum levels of 25 ( OH) D ( 21.8 ng/mL) than healthy controls ( 34.3 ng/mL) ( chi-square = 11.5; P = .0007). Patients with bullous diseases showed the lowest vitamin D mean values ( 18.2 ng/mL). The linear multiple regression model showed 25 ( OH) D levels to be influenced by age , season of blood vitamin D levels assessment , and psoriasis duration.These results confirm the reduced vitamin D levels in psoriatic patients when compared to healthy controls , and provide new evidence regarding the association of vitamin D levels and psoriasis duration. The limits of our study include its observational nature and the small number of patients undergoing biological immunosuppressive therapies.
