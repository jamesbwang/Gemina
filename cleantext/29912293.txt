  The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 ( CRISPR/Cas9) system uses single-guide RNAs for genome editing , making it a simple , robust , powerful tool for targeted gene mutagenesis , knockout and knock-in/replacement , as well as transcriptional regulation. Here , we review the working principles , components and potential modifications of CRISPR/Cas9 for efficient single and multiplex gene editing in plants. We also describe recent work that has used CRISPR/Cas9 to improve economically important traits in crop plants. Although the apparent ease of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing may make it appear as though scientists are merely playing with plant genomes , the combined power of CRISPR/Cas9 has enabled vital research to be completed in the battle toward optimization and adaptation of crop species , permitting crucial advances to be achieved in crop improvement.
