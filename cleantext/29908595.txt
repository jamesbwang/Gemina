  Viruses<pathogen> represent the most abundant and diverse of the biological entities in environmental waters , including the seas and probably also freshwater systems. They are important players in ecological networks in waters and influence global biochemical cycling and community composition dynamics. Among the many diverse viruses from terrestrial environments found in environmental waters , some are plant , animal , and/or human pathogens. The majority of pathogenic viral species found in waters are very stable and can survive outside host cells for long periods. The occurrence of such viruses in environmental waters has raised concerns because of the confirmation of the infectivity of waterborne viruses even at very low concentrations. This chapter focuses mainly on the survival of human , animal , and plant pathogenic viruses in aqueous environments , the possibility of their water-mediated transmission , the ecological implications of viruses in water , the methods adapted for detecting such viruses , and how to minimize the risk of viruses spreading through water.
