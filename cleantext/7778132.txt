  Scorpion long-chain insect selective neurotoxin AaIT has the potential to be used against agricultural insect pests. However , there is still a lack of a heterologous gene expression system that can express AaIT efficiently. Here , using X33 as the host strain and pPICZÎ±A as the expression vector , one transformant had the highest expression of recombinant AaIT ( rAaIT) was obtained , and secreted as high as 240 mg/l rAaIT in fed-batch fermentation. Secretory rAaIT was purified by Ni
