  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM) is the most common known inherited heart disorder , with a prevalence of 1:500 of the adult population. Etiology of HCM can be heterogeneous , with sarcomeric gene disease as the leading cause in up to 60 % of the patients , and with a number of possible different diseases ( phenocopies) in about 10 % -15 % of the patients. Early diagnosis of storage and infiltrative disorders , particularly those with specific treatments ( i.e. , Fabry disease and/or amyloidosis) , means early management and treatment , with a significant impact on patients prognosis. Here , we report on four different cases of HCM , highlighting difficulties to make differential diagnosis of different forms of cardiomyopathies , and their potential impact on the management.
