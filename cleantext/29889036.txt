  To analyze the implantation of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( LRP) in the Public Health System in the Autonomous Community of Madrid ( CAM) and to investigate the different results between laparoscopic and open radical prostatectomy. We performed a retrospective analysis over a database containing data from 25 hospitals in CAM. We chose 8225 patients treated by radical prostatectomy ( open or laparoscopic). Data were collected using a questionnaire including hospital , length of stay , readmissions and mortality. Values are shown in number , percentage and rank. Statistical significance is shown with p < 0.05. Increase of LRP is shown in the period of study , representing only a 11.9 % of the radical prostatectomies in 2004 and reaching 56.8 % in 2012. There were no significant statistical differences in age , severity or readmissions when stratified by hospital or by technique. We found a 1.05 days increase in length of stay in long-standing hospitals compared to newer hospitals. We also found a decrease in length of stay in LRP group compared to open retropubic prostatectomy ( ORP): 4.84 days vs 6.79 days , ( p < 0.001). RP is consolidated as a therapy in CAM. LRP has been successfully implemented in CAM , offering advantage over ORP in terms of hospital stay. We observed statistically significant difference in length of stay in advantage of recent hospitals regarding longstanding.
