  Plants adapt to alterations in light conditions by controlling their gene expression profiles. Expression of light-inducible genes is transcriptionally induced by transcription factors such as HY5. However , few detailed analyses have been carried out on the control of transcription start sites ( TSSs). Of the various wavelengths of light , it is blue light ( BL) that regulates physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> such as hypocotyl elongation and flowering time. To understand how gene expression is controlled not only by transcript abundance but also by TSS selection , we examined genome-wide TSS profiles in
