  Multiple<symptom> organ<symptom> failure<symptom> ( MOF) is a primary threat to the survival of patients with systemic inflammation<symptom>. Blood purification is employed in the treatment of MOF , as an artificial kidney or artificial liver. This study focuses on the effects of continuous blood purification ( CBP) on ameliorating MOF through regulating the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) signaling pathway in a rat model. A rat model of MOF was successfully established by endotoxin injection after hemorrhagic shock<symptom> resuscitation. The mRNA expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) and p38 MAPK of liver , kidney , and lung tissues in each group were measured by RT-qPCR at each measuring time point. To evaluate the activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway , protein levels of phosphorylated p38 ( p-p38) MAPK and p38 MAPK was measured by western blot analysis. The serum levels of nitric oxide and TNF-α were determined. After CBP treatment , the levels of SGPT , SGOT , Cr , and BUN were significantly declined , while the PaO2 value was increased. Expressions of p38 MAPK mRNA , iNOS mRNA , p-p38 MAPK protein and p38 MAPK protein , and nitric oxide and TNF-α levels were markedly elevated in MOF , an effect blunted by CPB. Meanwhile , pathological sections of liver , kidney , and lung tissues after CPB treatment ameliorated swelling and inflammation<symptom>. Our study proved that CBP could downregulate the p38 MAPK signaling pathway , suppress iNOS expression , reduced the serum levels of nitric oxide and TNF-α , thus ameliorate symptom of MOF.
