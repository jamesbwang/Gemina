  Overcrowding conditions and temperatures shifts regularly manifest in large-scale infections of farmed fish , resulting in economic losses for the global aquaculture industries. Increased understanding of the functional mechanisms of fish antimicrobial host defenses is an important step forward in prevention of pathogen-induced morbidity and mortality in aquaculture setting. Like other vertebrates , macrophage-lineage cells are integral to fish immune responses and for this reason , much of the recent fish immunology research has focused on fish macrophage biology. These studies have revealed notable similarities as well as striking differences in the molecular strategies by which fish and higher vertebrates control their respective macrophage polarization and functionality. In this review , we address the current understanding of the biological mechanisms of teleost macrophage functional heterogeneity and immunity , focusing on the key cytokine regulators that control fish macrophage development and their antimicrobial armamentarium.
