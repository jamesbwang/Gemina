  In π-conjugated polymers ( πCPs) , crystallinity and fluorescence typically exhibit a trade-off relationship. Here , we have synthesized a highly crystalline and fluorescent π-conjugated polymer with a simple alternating structure of 1,2,4,5-tetrafluorophenylene and 3,3 '- dihexyl-2,2 '- bithiophene units. In film , the polymer exhibited efficient red-colored fluorescence , an improved quantum yield ( Φ
