  The coupling between neighboring backbone ϕ and ψ dihedral angles ( torsions) has been well appreciated in protein force field development , as in correction map ( CMAP) potentials. However , although preferences of backbone torsions are significantly affected by side-chain conformation , there has been no easy way to optimize this coupling. Herein , we prove that the three-dimensional ( 3D) free energy hypersurface of joint ( ϕ , ψ , χ
