  ( Purpose) The purpose of this study was to confirm the correlation between racket velocity during the forehand smash movements with shoulder extensor strength and internal rotator strength in the neutral and abducted positions. ( Subjects and Methods) Fourteen collegiate badminton players participated in the study. Measurements were performed shoulder strength , using torque calculated from the upper extremity length and the isometric force , and racket velocity during the forehand smash movements. The shoulder extensor strength and internal rotator strength were measured in the neutral and abducted positions. ( Results) The extension torque and internal rotation torque of the shoulder in the neutral position were not significantly correlated with racket velocity. Additionally , correlations between extension torque of the shoulder in the maximum abducted position and racket velocity were insignificant. However , the internal rotation torque of the shoulder in the abducted external rotated position was significantly correlated with racket velocity ( r = 0.652). ( Conclusion) The shoulder internal rotator strength in the abducted external rotated position are suitable measurements for evaluating badminton players.
