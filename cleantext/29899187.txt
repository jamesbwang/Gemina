  Class B scavenger receptors , scavenger receptor B1 ( SR-B1) and cluster of differentiation 36 ( CD36) , are broadly expressed cell-surface proteins and are believed to serve as multifaceted players in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in mammals. Because of its ability to recognise distinct odour-active volatile compounds and its presence in murine olfactory epithelium , CD36 has recently emerged as a participant in the detection of odorants within the nasal cavity. However , there have been no attempts to assess whether SR-B1 has such a role. In this study , we performed a cell-free in-vitro assay utilising a peptide mimic of the receptor , and demonstrated that SR-B1 could recognise aliphatic aldehydes ( e.g. , tetradecanal) , a distinct class of volatile odorants , as potential ligands. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western immunoblot analyses , we detected the expression of SR-B1 mRNA and protein , respectively , in mouse olfactory tissue. Finally , we immunohistochemically mapped the distribution of SR-B1 in the surface layer of olfactory epithelium in vivo , which is the first line of odorant detection. These findings uncover a novel role for SR-B1 as a contributor to the capture of specific odorants in the nasal cavity of mammals.
