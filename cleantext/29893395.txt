  The development of suitable chiral catalysts , which represent powerful , economically feasible tools for the preparation of optically active organic molecules , is a fundamental endeavour in synthetic chemistry. Chiral phosphoric acids derived from axially chiral 1,1 '- bi-2-naphthol ( BINOL) are a widely used class of strong Br√∏nsted acid catalysts and have been applied successfully in many asymmetric catalyzed reactions. Accordingly , the development and application of chiral spirocyclic phosphoric acids derived from axially chiral 1,1 '- spirobiindane-7,7 '- diol ( SPINOL) have received increasing attention in the last eight years. This review covers the synthetic methods and the application of chiral spirocyclic phosphoric acids in asymmetric catalysis.
