  A series of A ⋅ water , B ⋅ water complexes ( A = acid , B = base) are studied at the G4 level of theory to show that water acidity or basicity can be modulated by non-covalent interactions. Protic and non-protic acids interacting with water form hydrogen bonds or other kinds of non-covalent interactions , respectively , that may dramatically change the acidity of water up to almost 360 kJ ⋅ mol
