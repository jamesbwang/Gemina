  In the current experiment , we investigated the immune-modulatory potential of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) and conditioned media ( CM) in attenuating of chronic asthmatic changes in a rat model. Male rats were divided into control ( C) and ovalbumin-sensitized ( S) groups , which further allocated into three subgroups; rats received systemically 50 μl volume of PBS ( C and S groups) , CM ( CSV and SSV groups) and rats received intravenous infusion of 2 × 106 bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( rBMMSCs) ( CCV and SCV groups). Two weeks later , the expression of interleukin ( IL) -4 , IL-13 , and IL-10 , miRNA133 , and miRNA155 was measured by real-time PCR. Pathological changes and the recruitment of rBMMSCs into pulmonary parenchyma were evaluated by histopathological and immunofluorescence analyses , respectively. The systemic injection of rBMMSCs , but not CM , decreased the levels of IL-4 , IL-13 , IL-10 , miRNA133 , miRNA155 and reduced pathological changes in sensitized rats as compared with other sensitized groups ( p < 0.001 to p < 0.05). rBMMSCs transmigrated to lung tissue in cell-administrated rats , albeit intensity of asthmatic changes , in turn , affected the amount of recruited cells. Collectively , our data suggest the potential role of MSCs , but not CM , in reducing pathological changes possibly via the modulation of miRNA133 and miRNA155 during asthmatic changes.
