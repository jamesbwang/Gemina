  Almost half of all patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) have distant metastases at presentation. One-third of patients with NSCLC will have brain metastases. Without effective treatment , the median survival is only 1 month. However , it is difficult to treat brain metastases with systemic chemotherapy since the agents have difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier. Therefore , it is important to estimate the patient 's survival prognosis. The aim of this study was to analyze prognostic factors for survival in Turkish patients who received chemotherapy after cranial irradiation for NSCLC with brain metastases. We retrospectively reviewed 698 patients with brain metastases resulting from NSCLC. Ten potential prognostic variables were chosen for analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify prognostic factors associated with overall survival ( OS). Among the 10 variables for univariate analysis , six were identified to have prognostic significance; these included sex , smoking history , histology , number of brain metastases , extracranial metastases , and neurosurgical resection. Multivariate analysis by the Cox proportional hazard model showed that a smoking history , extracranial metastases , and neurosurgical resection were independent negative prognostic factors for OS. Smoking history , extracranial metastases , and neurosurgical resection were considered independent negative prognostic factors for OS. These findings may facilitate pretreatment prediction of survival and can be used for selecting patients for more appropriate treatment options.
