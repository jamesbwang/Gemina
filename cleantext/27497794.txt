  Integration of genetic information is becoming increasingly important in clinical practice. However , genetic information is often ambiguous and difficult to understand , and clinicians have reported low-self-efficacy in integrating genetics into their care routine. The Health Level Seven ( HL7) Infobutton standard helps to integrate online knowledge resources within Electronic Health Records ( EHRs) and is required for EHR certification in the US. We implemented a prototype of a standards-based genetic reporting application coupled with infobuttons leveraging the Infobutton and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ( FHIR) Standards. Infobutton capabilities were provided by Open Infobutton , an open source package compliant with the HL7 Infobutton Standard. The resulting prototype demonstrates how standards-based reporting of genetic results , coupled with curated knowledge resources , can provide dynamic access to clinical knowledge on demand at the point of care. The proposed functionality can be enabled within any EHR system that has been certified through the US Meaningful Use program.
