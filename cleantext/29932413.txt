  This study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of two formulations of- DuvieTM ( 0.5-mg lobeglitazone sulfate). This study was designed as an open-label , randomized , single-dose , crossover bioequivalence study in healthy male subjects. A total of 28 subjects were randomized into two groups: one group received the test drug , 0.5-mg DuvieTM tablets , which have formulations available on the global market; and the other group received the reference drug , the initially-approved 0.5-mg DuvieTM tablets. Plasma samples were collected for up to 48 hours after drug treatment and were analyzed for lobeglitazone using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Individual pharmacokinetic properties were determined by noncompartmental methods. Safety assessments were performed. 28 subjects completed the study and were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. The mean ( standard deviation) values of- AUClast for the test and reference formulations were 367.49 ( 157.92) and 362.40 ( 140.05) ng Ã— h/mL , respectively. The mean ( standard deviation) values of Cmax for the test and reference formulations were 50.35 ( 6.94) and 49.29 ( 6.71) ng/mL , respectively. The 90 % confidence intervals for AUClast and Cmax were 0.9150- 1.1088 and 0.9879- 1.0561 , respectively. All adverse events were mild , and there were no serious adverse events. This study suggests that the two lobeglitazone tablet formulations have similar exposure and absorption rates. Therefore , the newly-developed formulation of the 0.5-mg DuvieTM tablet is expected to contribute to the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes..
