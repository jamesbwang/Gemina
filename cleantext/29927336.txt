  Nivolumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody blocking PD-1 with demonstrated effectiveness against metastatic urothelial carcinoma. In this review , we describe the pharmacological properties of nivolumab and the treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma with this checkpoint inhibitor after the failure of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Cancer immunotherapy by checkpoint inhibition offers potential to prolong patient survival with well manageable toxicity although serious immune-related adverse events may occur. The overall response rate to nivolumab after first-line chemotherapy is about 20 %. Patients unfit for cisplatin may benefit from first-line cancer immunotherapy. It remains unclear which patient will respond and PD-1/ PD-L1 expression alone is not a sufficiently reliable predictive biomarker.
