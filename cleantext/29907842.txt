  Dysfunction in reward-related aspects of feeding , and consequent overeating in humans , is a major contributor to obesity. Intrauterine undernutrition and overnutrition are among the predisposing factors , but the exact mechanism of how overeating develops is still unclear. Consummatory behavior is regulated by the medial shell ( mSh) of the accumbens nucleus ( Nac) through direct connections with the rostral part of the lateral hypothalamic area ( LHA). Our aim was to investigate whether an altered Nac-LHA circuit may underlie hyperphagic behavior. Intrauterine protein-restricted ( PR) male Wistar rats were used as models for hyperphagia. The experiments were performed using young adult control ( normally nourished) and PR animals. Sweet condensed milk ( SCM) served as a reward to test consumption and subsequent activation ( Fos +) of Nac and LHA neurons. Expression levels of type 1 and 2 dopamine receptors ( D1R , D2R) in the Nac , as well as tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH) levels in the ventral tegmental area , were determined. The D1R agonist SKF82958 was injected into the mSh-Nac of control rats to test the effect of D1R signaling on SCM intake and neuronal cell activation in the LHA. A group of food reward-representing D1R + neurons was identified in the mSh-Nac. Activation ( Fos +) of these neurons was highly proportional to the consumed palatable food. D1R agonist treatment attenuated SCM intake and diminished the number of SCM-activated cells in the LHA. Hyperphagic PR rats showed increased intake of SCM , reduced D1R expression , and an impaired response to SCM-evoked neuronal activation in the mSh-Nac , accompanied by an elevated number of Fos + neurons in the LHA compared to controls. Sensitivity of food reward-representing neurons in the mSh-Nac determines the level of satisfaction that governs cessation of consumption , probably through connections with the LHA. D1R signaling is a key element in this function , and is impaired in obesity-prone rats.
