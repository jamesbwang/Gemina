  To study the levels of Pb , Se , As and Hg in brick-teas from main producing areas in China and evaluate the safety. A total of 31 samples of brick tea from seven provinces where minority nationalities were accustomed to drinking a large quantity of brick tea were collected , Pb concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry , and concentrations of As , Se , Hg were detected by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry. The data were analyzed by SPSS 22. 0 software. The average lead levels in brick tea was 6. 232 mg/kg , which exceeded the limit standard of GB 2762-2012. There was a great difference of Pbconcentrations among the various kinds of brick tea producing in different provinces , and the lower Pb concentrations detected in Tuo tea and Puerh tea producing in Yunnan Province , was 1. 337 mg/kg , and the highest determined in Kang brick producing in Sichuan Province , was 9. 998 mg/kg. In addition , the concentrations of As and Hg were all below the limit standard of NY 659-2003. For people accustomed to drinking brick tea for a long term , the average intake amounts of Pb , As , Hg through brick tea contributed 13. 63 % , 1. 71 % and 0. 29 % to dietary Pb , As , Hg of the provisional tolerable weekly intake ( PTWI) recommended by Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee of Food Additives ( JECFA) which was in safe range. Otherwise , the daily selenium intake through brick tea was 0. 188 Î¼g , which contributed 0. 38 % to the selenium recommended nutrient intake ( RNI) by Chinese Nutrition Society. Excessive levels of lead in the brick tea is prominent. As , Hg and Se in brick tea are in low exposure level.
