  The ability to remember and to navigate to safe places is necessary for survival. Place navigation is known to involve medial entorhinal cortex ( MEC)- hippocampal connections. However , learning-dependent changes in neuronal activity in the distinct circuits remain unknown. Here , by using optic fiber photometry in freely behaving mice , we discovered the experience-dependent induction of a persistent-task-associated ( PTA) activity. This PTA activity critically depends on learned visual cues and builds up selectively in the MEC layer II-dentate gyrus , but not in the MEC layer III-CA1 pathway , and its optogenetic suppression disrupts navigation to the target location. The findings suggest that the visual system , the MEC layer II , and the dentate gyrus are essential hubs of a memory circuit for visually guided navigation.
