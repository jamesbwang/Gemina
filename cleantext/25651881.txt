  Metals and radionuclides ( M&R s) are a worldwide concern claiming for resilient , efficient , and sustainable clean-up measures aligned with environmental protection goals and global change constraints. The unique defense mechanisms of extremophilic bacteria and archaea have been proving usefulness towards M&R s bioremediation. Hence , extremophiles can be viewed as microfactories capable of providing specific and controlled services ( i.e. , genetic/metabolic mechanisms) and/or products ( e.g. , biomolecules) for that purpose. However , the natural physiological plasticity of such extremophilic microfactories can be further explored to nourish different hallmarks of M&R bioremediation , which are scantly approached in the literature and were never integrated. Therefore , this review not only briefly describes major valuable extremophilic pathways for M&R bioremediation , as it highlights the advances , challenges and gaps from the interplay of ` omics ' and biological engineering to improve extremophilic microfactories performance for M&R clean-up. Microfactories ' potentialities are also envisaged to close the M&R bioremediation processes and shift the classical idea of never ` getting rid ' of M&R s into making them ` the belle of the ball ' through bio-recycling and bio-recovering techniques.
