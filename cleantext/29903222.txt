  To understand the physical development of Uygur and Han children under 7 years old in Urumuqi , and analyze the age of adiposity rebound. Using stratified cluster sampling , 9682 Uygur and Han children under 7 years old were selected in 7 districts and 1 county in Urumqi in June 2015 , measuring their heights , weights , sitting heights , head circumference and chest circumference; comparingthe differences of weight for height Z-score ( WHZ) , drawing WHZ curves , calculating the adiposity rebound ages of Uygur and Han nationality boys and girls. The difference of physical development in low age groups was significant. There were significant differences in the WHZ of Uygur and Han boys in 0 month- ( t = 4. 277 , P < 0. 001) , 6 months- ( t = 2. 133 , P = 0. 033) , 5 years- ( t = 2. 278 , P = 0. 023) , 6-7 years ( t = 2. 503 , P = 0. 013) and all ages combined ( t = 5. 238 , P < 0. 001) , and significant differences exist in WHZ of Uygur and Han girls in 0 month- ( t = 2. 533 , P = 0. 011) and 1 year old- ( t = -2. 141 , P = 0. 033). The overall prevalence of overweight and obesity in boys was higher than that in girls under 7 years old ( overweight rate: Uygur boys 7. 97 % , Uygur girls 5. 46 %; Han boys 12. 55 % , Han girls 5. 90 %; obesity rate: Uygur boys 5. 58 % , Uygur girls 3. 48 %; Han boys 7. 73 % , Han girls 3. 92 %) , while overweight obesity ratio ( OOR) in Uygur girls were higher than Uygur boys ( girls OOR = 1. 57 , boys OOR = 1. 43) and OOR of Han girls was lower than that of boys ( girls OOR = 1. 50 , boys OOR = 1. 62). Mathematical model indicated that the adiposity rebound age of Han boys was 3. 94 years old ( 95 % CI 3. 54-4. 33) , Uygur boys was 4. 17 years old ( 95 % CI 2. 70-5. 72) and Han girls was 4. 56 years old ( 95 % CI 4. 14-4. 99) , and the adiposity rebound age of Uygur girls was 5. 57 years old ( 95 % CI 4. 00-7. 13). The prevalence of overweight and obesity among Han children under seven years old is higher than that of Uygur children , and the age of fat rebound in Han children is earlier than that of Uygur children.
