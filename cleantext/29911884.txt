  Two new sesquiterpene lactones , rhizantholide A ( 1) and rhizantholide B ( 2) , together with five known compounds ( 3-7) have been isolated from the aerial parts of Centaurea rhizantha ( Asteraceae). Sesquiterpene lactones belong to guaianolide class , and rhizantholide B is a rare guaianolide characterized by a free primary alcoholic function at C-10 along with a 3β,10β-epoxy function. Their structures have been established on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR experiments , as well as HR-ESIMS. The antimicrobial activity of compounds 1-7 has been evaluated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Only deacylcynaropicrin 8-O- ( 3 '- hydroxy-2 '- methylpropionate) ( 5) showed moderate antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> with a MIC/MBC value of 500 μg/mL. All isolated compounds have been also evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against cancer cells. Among them , compound 5 showed the highest cytotoxic activity with IC
