  The field of stromal immunology has risen to prominence in the last decade , fuelled by accumulating evidence that nonhaematopoietic mesenchymal cells are not simply involved in modulating tissue structure , but actively contribute to immune processes. In addition to regulating tissue integrity during homoeostasis , stromal cells are sensitive sensors of inflammatory stimuli produced downstream of tissue injury or infection , and respond by producing a wide variety of chemokines , cytokines and adhesion factors that contribute to immunity and tissue repair. When not appropriately regulated , these same processes can result in inflammatory pathology and organ dysfunction. In this review , we provide a brief overview of stromal immunology , followed by a comprehensive discussion of how the IL-6 family cytokine oncostatin M ( OSM) coordinates stromal cell activity in diverse physiological and pathological contexts. We conclude by providing a perspective on the potential clinical value of the OSM-stromal cell axis and how this pathway might be exploited therapeutically.
