  Purpose HLA mismatching increases mortality after unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation. The role of the patient 's germline variation on survival is not known. Patients and Methods We previously identified 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms within the HLA region as markers of transplantation determinants and tested these in an independent cohort of 1,555 HLA-mismatched unrelated transplants. Linkage disequilibrium mapping across class II identified candidate susceptibility features. The candidate gene was confirmed in an independent cohort of 3,061 patients. Results Patient rs429916AA/AC was associated with increased transplantation-related mortality compared with rs429916CC ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 1.39; 95 % CI , 1.12 to 1.73; P = .003); rs429916A positivity was a proxy for DOA * 01:01:05. Mortality increased with one ( HR , 1.17; 95 % CI , 1.0 to 1.36; P = .05) and two ( HR , 2.51; 95 % CI , 1.41 to 4.45; P = .002) DOA * 01:01:05 alleles. HLA-DOA * 01:01:05 was a proxy for HLA-DRB1 alleles encoding FEY ( P < 10E
