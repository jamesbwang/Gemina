  A bifunctional cationic metal-organic framework ( ( Cu9 ( OH) 6Cl2 ( itp) 6 ( 1,4-bdc) 3) ( NO3) 2 ( OH) 2 · 20H2O) n ( 1-NO3-OH · 20H2O) was synthesized and characterized ( itp = 1-imidazol-1-yl-3- ( 1,2,4-triazol-4-yl) propane , 1,4-bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate). In 1-NO3-OH · 20H2O , three ( Cu3 ( μ3-OH) ( μ2-OH)) trimeric clusters are bridged by two μ3-Cl and form a ( Cu9 ( μ3-OH) 3 ( μ2-OH) 3 ( μ3-Cl) 2) cluster. Such a nonanuclear copper ( ii) cluster ( Cu9 ( μ3-OH) 3 ( μ2-OH) 3 ( μ3-Cl) 2) has not been reported till now , at least to the best of our knowledge. 1-NO3-OH · 20H2O showed a 6-connected 2D 36-hxl net based on a nonanuclear copper ( ii) cluster ( Cu9 ( μ3-OH) 3 ( μ2-OH) 3 ( μ3-Cl) 2). 1-NO3-OH · 20H2O is also the first 2D 36-hxl net-based nonanuclear cluster. 1-NO3-OH ( guest-free phase) showed fast and highly efficient Cr2O72- and CrO42- trapping , and good recyclability for capturing Cr2O72- and CrO42-. The adsorption capacities of 1-NO3-OH to capture Cr2O72- and CrO42- were 1.762 mol mol-1 ( 154.8 mg g-1) and 1.896 mol mol-1 ( 89.5 mg g-1) , respectively , at a molar ratio of 1: 2 ( 1-NO3-OH to 2.5 × 10-3 mol L-1 Cr2O72- or CrO42-). 1-NO3-OH exhibited the selective sorption of Cr2O72- or CrO42- from a solution containing a mixture of Cr2O72- or CrO42- and a ten-fold molar amount of ClO4- , NO3- , Cl- , BF4- or a five-fold molar amount of mol L-1 SO42-. 1-NO3-OH could capture 87.9 % dilute Cr2O72- or 91.8 % dilute CrO42- at an equimolar 1-NO3-OH to 20 ppm Cr2O72- or CrO42-. 1-NO3-OH · 20H2O exhibited a highly efficient photocatalytic degradation of the cationic organic dyes methylene blue ( MB) and rhodamine B ( RhB) under visible light irradiation , and was shown to be a good photocatalyst for photocatalytic degradation of the cationic organic dyes.
