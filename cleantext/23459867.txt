  Recently , nano-sized ultrasound contrast agents encapsulating drugs for cancer diagnosis and therapy have attracted much attention. However , the ultrasound signal of these agents is too weak to obtain an ideal ultrasound imaging effect. Furthermore , conventional ultrasound contrast agents with strong echo signal are not suitable for drug delivery against cancer because of their large size. To circumvent this problem , phase-transition ultrasound contrast agents are believed to be an excellent choice.
