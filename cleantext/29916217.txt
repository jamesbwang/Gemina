  Besides its hematopoietic function , the erythropoietin ( EPO) may protect tissues from degenerative disorders. As such , EPO and its receptors were revealed in nonhematopoietic cells , including stromal and endometrial epithelial- cells. However , the role of EPO in endometrial disorders was still unknown. Here we aimed to examine the role of EPO and its receptor activation in the development of endometriosis in rats. Animals were treated with EPO , darbepoietin ( synthetic form of EPO) or EPO 's receptor activator , Mircera , after development of endometriosis. Endometriosis was induced by estrogen-administration following surgical attachment of endometrial surface on the inner abdominal wall. Treatments were started 3 weeks after induction of endometriosis and continued for the following 3 weeks. For the analysis of recurrence of endometriosis , additional analyses were conducted 3 weeks after cessation of treatments. As compared with vehicle- treated animals , lesion<symptom> size was reduced significantly and recurrence of endometriosis was not observed in all treatment groups. Histopathological examination revealed that EPO and darbepoietin were more effective than Mircera- and vehicle- treated animals. Here we provide evidence that EPO is a promising candidate for the treatment of endometriosis. Particularly , our histopathological results indicate that EPO is more effective than its receptor activator Mircera in the development endometriosis.
