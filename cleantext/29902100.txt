  This paper draws on a 2015 study in New Zealand that examined perceptions of registered nurses ( RNs) and general practitioners ( GPs) regarding the role of Nurse Practitioners ( NPs) in long-term aged care facilities ( LTACF). To explore the attitudes of RNs and GPs regarding the role of NPs in LTACFs. A descriptive , mixed methods design with a survey and invitation to interview was used. RNs and GPs who provided hospital-level care were invited to participate. The findings showed RNs and GPs are open to considering the NP role in aged care. However , there remains a lack of understanding of what NPs do. This study suggests a shift in attitude towards accepting the NP role by RNs and GP working in LTACFs.
