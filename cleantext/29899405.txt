  Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder , featuring social communication deficit and repetitive/restricted behaviors as common symptoms. Its prevalence has continuously increased , but , till now , there are no therapeutic approaches to relieve the core symptoms , particularly social deficit. In previous studies , abnormal function of the glutamatergic neural system has been proposed as a critical mediator and therapeutic target of ASD-associated symptoms. Here , we investigated the possible roles of Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors ( AMPARs) in autism symptoms using two well-known autistic animal models , Cntnap2 knockout ( KO) mice and in utero valproic acid-exposed ICR ( VPA) mice. We found that Cntnap2 KO mice displayed decreased glutamate receptor expression and transmission. Contrarily , VPA mice exhibited increased glutamate receptor expression and transmission. Next , we investigated whether AMPAR modulators ( positive-allosteric-modulator for Cntnap2 KO mice and antagonist for VPA mice) can improve autistic symptoms by normalizing the aberrant excitatory transmission in the respective animal models. Interestingly , the AMPAR modulation specifically ameliorated social deficits in both animal models. These results indicated that AMPAR-derived excitatory neural transmission changes can affect normal social behavior. To validate this , we injected an AMPAR agonist or antagonist in control ICR mice and , interestingly , these treatments impaired only the social behavior , without affecting the repetitive and hyperactive behaviors. Collectively , these results provide insight into the role of AMPARs in the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of ASD , and demonstrate that modulation of AMPAR can be a potential target for the treatment of social behavior deficits associated with ASD.
