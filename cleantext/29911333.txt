  The high-probability ( high-p) instructional sequence involves the delivery of a series of high-probability instructions immediately before delivery of a low-probability or target instruction. It has been shown to be efficacious for treating noncompliance among children and individuals with intellectual disabilities. Previous research ( Esch & Fryling ,) has suggested that matching the topography of the response required to comply with high-p instructions with the topography of the response required to comply with the low-p instruction in the sequence may lead to greater increases in compliance with the low-p instruction. In this study , we compared high-p instructions that required both similar and dissimilar responses to two topographies of low-p instructions ( motor and vocal) among two young children. Results suggested that the topography of the response required by the high-p instructions did not affect levels of compliance with low-p instructions for either participant. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.
