  Eukaryotic cells contain a huge variety of internally specialized subcellular compartments. Stoichiogenomics aims to reveal patterns of elements usage in biological macromolecules. However , the stoichiogenomic characteristics and how they adapt to various subcellular microenvironments are still unknown. Here we first updated the definition of stoichiogenomics. Then we applied it to subcellular research , and detected distinctive nitrogen content of nuclear and hydrogen , sulfur content of extracellular proteomes. Specially , we found that acidic amino acids ( AAs) content of cytoskeletal proteins is the highest. The increased charged AAs are mainly caused by the eukaryotic originated cytoskeletal proteins. Functional subdivision of the cytoskeleton showed that activation , binding/association , and complexes are the three largest functional categories. Electrostatic interaction analysis showed an increased electrostatic interaction between both primary sequences and PPI interfaces of 3D structures , in the cytoskeleton. This study creates a blueprint of subcellular stoichiogenomic characteristics , and explains that charged AAs of the cytoskeleton increased greatly in evolution , which offer material basis for the eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins to act in two ways of electrostatic interactions , and further perform their activation , binding/association and complex formation.
