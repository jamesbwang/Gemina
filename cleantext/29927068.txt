  Covalent ligands have recently regained considerable attention in drug discovery. The rational design of such ligands , however , is still faced with particular challenges , mostly related to the fact that covalent bond formation is a quantum mechanical phenomenon which can not adequately be handled by the force fields or empirical approaches typically used for noncovalent protein-ligand interactions. Although the necessity for quantum chemical approaches is clear , they can not yet routinely be applied on large data sets of ligands or for a broader exploration of binding modes in docking calculations. On the other hand , technical solutions for performing docking calculations with covalent ligands are available , but their scope is normally quite limited. Scoring functions typically neglect the contribution from covalent bond formation completely. In this situation , the question arises how to approach covalent ligands and which methods to choose for their docking and design.
