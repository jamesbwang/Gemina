  The European Academy for Medicine of Ageing ( EAMA) was founded in 1995 as an `` Advanced Postgraduate Course in Geriatric Medicine '' , in order to train future key opinion leaders in geriatric medicine. Recent changes across European Healthcare systems have changed the needs for leadership competences for geriatricians. Therefore , it became mandatory to further develop EAMA 's learning objectives catalogue. Following a comprehensive needs assessment among students and visiting professors of the EAMA , a template containing seven key domains derived from the needs assessment was developed. EAMA professors had the chance to feedback learning objectives aligned with the seven domains. Feedbacks were transcribed into a first draft of a learning objectives catalogue during this meeting. This first draft was reflected with EAMA network members ( former EAMA students) and finalized following a second focus group among board members. 24 learning objectives which cover the spectrum of knowledge , skills and attitudes necessary to develop leadership roles in geriatric medicine are included in the new EAMA learning objectives catalogue. Rate of agreement achieved in open ratings was > 90 % for all selected items among the board members. The recently developed learning objectives catalogue of EAMA presented within this publication reflects a clear shift from knowledge-based education and training towards a comprehensive programme design for leadership development.
