  The present study explores the motivation for fatherhood in a sample of childless German gay and heterosexual men aged 18 to 40 years ( N = 628 + 638). Referring to the theory of planned behavior ( TPB) , three potential predictors were considered: the individual 's attitude toward having children , perceived attitudes of significant others toward fatherhood , and anticipated parental self-efficacy. Regarding fathering motivation , the general desire to become a father was differentiated from the more concrete fathering intention. Level- and structure-oriented analyses were combined in an innovative way. Consistent with previous research , gay participants reported weaker fathering desires and intentions than their heterosexual counterparts; however , there was no wider desire-intention gap among gay than among heterosexual participants ( level-oriented analysis). As expected , associations between TPB predictors and fathering motivation were independent of sexual orientation ( structure-oriented analysis). Participants ' appreciation of children and their self-attribution of parental self-efficacy were strongly associated with fathering intentions; these associations were substantially mediated by fathering desires. However , the association between significant others ' attitudes toward fatherhood and participants ' fathering motivation was comparably weak. Demographics were controlled for in each analysis. Results are discussed from both an individual and a societal perspective. ( PsycINFO Database Record
