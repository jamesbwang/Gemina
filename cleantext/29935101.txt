  Myotonia congenita ( MC) is a skeletal-muscle hyperexcitability disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ClC-1 chloride channel. Mutations are scattered over the entire sequence of the channel protein , with more than 30 mutations located in the poorly characterized cytosolic C-terminal domain. In this study , we characterized , through patch clamp , seven ClC-1 mutations identified in patients affected by MC of various severities and located in the C-terminal region. The p.Val829Met , p.Thr832Ile , p.Val851Met , p.Gly859Val , and p.Leu861Pro mutations reside in the CBS2 domain , while p.Pro883Thr and p.Val947Glu are in the C-terminal peptide. We showed that the functional properties of mutant channels correlated with the clinical phenotypes of affected individuals. In addition , we defined clusters of ClC-1 mutations within CBS2 and C-terminal peptide subdomains that share the same functional defect: mutations between 829 and 835 residues and in residue 883 induced an alteration of voltage dependence , mutations between 851 and 859 residues , and in residue 947 induced a reduction of chloride currents , whereas mutations on 861 residue showed no obvious change in ClC-1 function. This study improves our understanding of the mechanisms underlying MC , sheds light on the role of the C-terminal region in ClC-1 function , and provides information to develop new antimyotonic drugs.
