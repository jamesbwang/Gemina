Histologically , a sub-epidermal blister is seen and immunofluorescence shows immunoglobulin G antibodies directed against the structural components of the keratinocytic hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 and BP230. Multiple treatment modalities are present for this condition , including anti-inflammatory medications , medications that reduce antibody formation , and treatments to increase the elimination of antibodies. The aim of this case report is to present a classic case of this condition , to highlight an awareness of differing treatment options , and to advocate referral to a dermatologist given its potential severity.
