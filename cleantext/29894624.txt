  Two-dimensional structures can potentially lead to not only modulation of electron transport but also the variations of optical property. Protonic ruthenium oxide , a two-dimensional atomic sheet material , has been synthesized , and its optoelectric properties have been investigated. The results indicate that protonic ruthenium oxide is an excellent candidate for use as a flexible , transparent conducting material. A hydrated-ruthenium-oxide sheet has been first prepared via the chemical exfoliation of sodium intercalated ruthenium oxide ( NaRuO
