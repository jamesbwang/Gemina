  The purpose of this study was to investigate clinical role and functional effects of miR-431 expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC). Expression of miR-431 in PTC patient tissue samples and plasma samples was examined by using qRT-PCR methods. Cell migration and invasion capacity were evaluated using transwell assays. Western blot analysis was performed to detect protein expression after miR-431 overexpression in PTC cells. We demonstrated that miR-431 expression was lower in PTC tissues and plasma samples compared to their corresponding controls. MiR-431 expression was particularly lower in PTC patients with lymph node ( LN) metastasis. In vitro , miR-431 overexpression significantly inhibited cell migration , invasion and EMT process by upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating Vimentin expression. Additionally , wedemonstrated that miR-431 overexpression suppressed Hedgehog ( Hh) signaling pathway by downregulating Gli1 expression. Our results indicated that miR-431 could serve as a predictor for PTC patients with positive lymph node metastasis and a potential target of PTC treatment.
