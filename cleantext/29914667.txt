  As the major vitamin D binding protein ( DBP) , the group-specific component ( GC) plays an important role in the bioactivity of vitamin D. Abnormal expression of GC gene may be associated with vitamin D related disease , type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM). DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. It has been reported that methylation in 3 ' untranslated region played a role in regulation of protein expression via interaction with miRNA. This study hypothesized that DNA methylation of 3 ' near region of GC gene ( 3 ` GC) might be associated with T2DM. The methylation status of the 3 ` GC was assessed with high resolution melt method. Logistic regression was applied to assess the risk of T2DM at different levels of 3 ` GC methylation. The results showed that methylation level of the 3 ` GC was higher in T2DM patients than in non-T2DM individuals ( P = .038). There was a significant association between 3 ` GC methylation level and T2DM ( adjusted OR 1.282; 95 % CI 1.062-1.548; P = .01). The association was independent upon serum glucose and insulin ( adjusted OR 1.561; 95 % CI 1.083-2.249; P = .017). Furthermore , there was a positive correlation between methylation level and the level of DBP in T2DM patients ( r = 0.126 , P = .036). The association was also significant after adjusting the potential impact of rs705117 ( P = .044). Besides , a positive correlation between methylation level and the level of fasting serum insulin was observed in non-T2DM ( r = 0.101 , P < .001). These results suggest that methylation status of the 3 ` GC is most likely associated with DBP expression , insulin secretion , and T2DM.
