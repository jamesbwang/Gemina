  Basilar artery occlusion ( BAO) ischemic stroke is a relatively rare condition with high morbidity and mortality rates. To date , the best acute reperfusion therapy for BAO has still not been established , mainly due to the lack of randomized controlled trials in this field. In this article , we review the history of BAO diagnosis and treatment , and the impact of modern technological resources on the clinical evolution and prognosis of BAO over time. Furthermore , we describe historical events and nonmedical literature descriptions related to BAO. We conclude that BAO is a singular example of how art may help medical sciences with accurate descriptions of medical conditions.
