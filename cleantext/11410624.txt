  Platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF)- BB and its receptor PDGFR are highly expressed in pulmonary hypertension ( PH) and mediate proliferation. Recently , we showed that PDGF-BB contracts pulmonary veins ( PVs) and that this contraction is prevented by inhibition of PDGFR-Î² ( imatinib/SU6668). Here , we studied PDGF-BB-induced contraction and downstream-signalling in isolated perfused lungs ( IPL) and precision-cut lung slices ( PCLS) of guinea pigs ( GPs). In IPLs , PDGF-BB was perfused after or without pre-treatment with imatinib ( perfused/nebulised) , the effects on the pulmonary arterial pressure ( P In IPLs , PDGF-BB increased P PDGF-BB/PDGFR regulates the pulmonary vascular tone by the generation of prostaglandins , the increase of calcium , the activation of MAPK- or PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling and actin remodelling. More insights in PDGF-BB downstream-signalling may contribute to develop new therapeutics for PH.
