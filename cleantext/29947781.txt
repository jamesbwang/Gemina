  Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) may present with nonspecific symptoms and diagnostic findings. Therefore , many diseases may mimic the clinical symptoms , endoscopic findings , and histologic features of IBD. In this paper , we will review mimics of IBD , dividing the diseases that can imitate IBD into noninfectious and infectious causes. For each disease state , we will discuss the clinical symptoms and endoscopic and histologic features. Finally , we will discuss how to distinguish these distinct disorders from IBD.
