  Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate ( NSCL/P) is a debilitating condition that not only affects the individual , but the entire family. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes with NSCL/P. Twelve polymorphisms in/nearby BRCA1 and BRCA2 were genotyped using Taqman chemistry. Our data set consisted of 3,473 individuals including 2,191 nonHispanic white ( NHW) individuals ( from 151 multiplex and 348 simplex families) and 1,282 Hispanic individuals ( from 92 multiplex and 216 simplex families). Data analysis was performed using Family-Based Association Test ( FBAT) , stratified by ethnicity and family history of NSCL/P. Nominal associations were found between NSCL/P and BRCA1 in Hispanics and BRCA2 in NHW and Hispanics ( p < .05). Significant haplotype associations were found between NSCL/P and both BRCA1 and BRCA2 ( p â‰¤ .004). Our results suggest a modest association between BRCA1 and BRCA2 and NSCL/P. Further studies in additional populations and functional studies are needed to elucidate the role of these genes in developmental processes and signaling pathways contributing to NSCL/P.
