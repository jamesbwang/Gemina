  The brain renin-angiotensin system ( RAS) is considered a crucial regulator for physiological homeostasis and disease progression. We evaluated the protective effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB) telmisartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2) activator xanthenone on experimental cerebral ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R) injury. Rats were divided into a sham control , a cerebral I/R control , a standard treatment ( nimodipine , 10 mg/kg/day , 15 days , p.o.) , three telmisartan treatments ( 1 , 3 , and 10 mg/kg/day , 15 days , p.o.) , and three xanthenone treatments ( 0.5 , 1 , and 2 mg/kg/day , 15 days , s.c.) groups. One hour after the last dose , all rats except the sham control group were exposed to 30-min cerebral ischemia followed by 24-h reperfusion. Brain ACE and ACE2 activities and the apoptotic marker caspase-3 levels were assessed. Glutathione ( GSH) , malondialdehyde ( MDA) , and nitric oxide end products ( NOx) as oxidative markers and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha ( TNF-α) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6) , and IL-10 as immunological markers were assessed. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical evaluation of glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP) were performed in cerebral cortex and hippocampus sections. Telmisartan and xanthenone in the higher doses restored MDA , NOx , TNF-α , IL-6 , caspase-3 , ACE , and GFAP back to normal levels and significantly increased GSH , IL-10 , and ACE2 compared to I/R control values. Histopathologically , both agents showed mild degenerative changes and necrosis<symptom> of neurons in cerebral cortex and hippocampus compared with I/R control group. Modulation of brain RAS , either through suppression of the classic ACE pathway or stimulation of its antagonist pathway ACE2 , may be a promising strategy against cerebral I/R damage.
