  Silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs) have been widely used as consumer products due to their antibacterial activities. Despite their extensive use , AgNPs have been reported to cause various types of cytotoxicity , including neurotoxicity. However , the potential action of AgNPs on early fetal development has not been elucidated. This study determined the effects of AgNPs on neural induction in human induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs) , used as a model for human fetal stage development. It was observed that exposure to AgNPs reduced the expression of several neural differentiation marker genes , including OTX2 , an early biomarker for neurogenesis in iPSCs. Since neural differentiation requires ATP as a source of energy , the intracellular ATP content was also measured. It was observed that AgNPs decreased intracellular ATP levels in iPSCs. Since AgNPs suppressed energy production , a critical mitochondrial function , the effects of AgNPs on mitochondrial dynamics were further studied. The results revealed that AgNPs induced mitochondrial fragmentation and reduced the level of mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 1 ( Mfn1). Previously , we reported that knockdown of Mfn1 in iPSCs inhibited neural induction via OTX2 downregulation. This suggested that AgNPs could induce cytotoxicity , including neurodevelopmental toxicity , via Mfn1-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction in iPSCs. Thus , mitochondrial function in iPSCs can be used for assessing the cytotoxic effects associated with nanomaterials , including AgNPs.
