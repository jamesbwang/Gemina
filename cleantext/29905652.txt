  Under the hypothesis that increased extracellular sodium induces sustained neuronal excitability with the onset and progression of migraine , this study evaluates dynamic in vivo Na fluxes in the brain of a preclinical rodent analogue of migraine. Ultra-high field Na MRI at 21.1 T has demonstrated potential to quantify sodium concentrations with good spatial and temporal resolution following the onset of central sensitization. Sprague-Dawley male rats with implanted intraperitoneal ( IP) lines were studied by MRI before and after an in situ injection of 10 mg/kg of nitroglycerin ( NTG) versus vehicle and saline controls. Slice-selective Na images were acquired using a multi-slice FID-based Chemical Shift Imaging sequence with resolution of 1.1 x 1.1 x 3 mm for a 9-min acquisition. A total of twenty-seven repeated scans were acquired over 1 h of baseline scanning and longitudinally up to 3 h post injection. Increases of Na MRI signal in the brainstem , extra-cerebral cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) and cisterna magna<pathogen> were evident almost immediately after NTG injection , gaining significance from controls in 36 min. The cerebellum and third ventricle also showed sustained trends of increased Na , with the former gaining significance at over 2 h post-NTG injection. The data provide evidence of an early change in sodium concentration , markedly in posterior fossa CSF and brainstem regions. Further study of fluctuations of sodium concentration and their modulation with treatments could help understand the dynamic features of migraine , location of a putative migraine generator , and guide development of therapeutic measures to correct the disturbance of sodium homeostasis.
