  Understanding the origins and maintenance of biodiversity remains one of biology 's grand challenges. From theory and observational evidence , we know that variability in environmental conditions through time is likely critical to the coexistence of competing species. Nevertheless , experimental tests of fluctuation-driven coexistence are rare and have typically focused on just one of two potential mechanisms , the temporal storage effect , to the neglect of the theoretically equally plausible mechanism known as relative nonlinearity of competition. We combined experiments and simulations in a system of nectar yeasts to quantify the relative contribution of the two mechanisms to coexistence. Resource competition models parameterized from single-species assays predicted the outcomes of mixed-culture competition experiments with 83 % accuracy. Model simulations revealed that both mechanisms have measurable effects on coexistence and that relative nonlinearity can be equal or greater in magnitude to the temporal storage effect. In addition , we show that their effect on coexistence can be both antagonistic and complementary. These results falsify the common assumption that relative nonlinearity is of negligible importance , and in doing so reveal the importance of testing coexistence mechanisms in combination.
