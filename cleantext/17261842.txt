  Binding of TRIP8b to the cyclic nucleotide binding domain ( CNBD) of mammalian hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ( HCN) channels prevents their regulation by cAMP. Since TRIP8b is expressed exclusively in the brain , we envisage that it can be used for orthogonal control of HCN channels beyond the central nervous system. To this end , we have identified by rational design a 40-aa long peptide ( TRIP8b
