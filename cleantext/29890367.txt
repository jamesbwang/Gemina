  Galectin-7 ( Gal-7) has been associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis. It is known that Gal-7 antagonises TGFβ-mediated effects in hepatocytes by interacting with Smad3. Previously , we have demonstrated that Gal-7 is related to CD4 + T cells responses; nevertheless , its effect and functional mechanism on CD4 + T cells responses remain unclear. The murine CD4 + T cells were respectively cultured with Gal-7 , anti-CD3/ CD28 mAbs , or with anti-CD3/ CD28 mAbs & Gal-7. The effects of Gal-7 on proliferation and the phenotypic changes in CD4 + T cells were assessed by flow cytometry. The cytokines from CD4 + T cells were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR. Subcellular localisation and expression of Smad3 were determined by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot , respectively. Gal-7 enhanced the proliferation of activated CD4 + T cells in a dose- and β-galactoside-dependent manner. Additionally , Gal-7 treatment did not change the ratio of Th2 cells in activated CD4 + T cells , while it increased the ratio of Th1 cells. Gal-7 also induced activated CD4 + T cells to produce a higher level of IFN-γ and TNF-α and a lower level of IL-10. Moreover , Gal-7 treatment signiﬁcantly accelerated nuclear export of Smad3 in activated CD4 + T cells. These results revealed a novel role of Gal-7 in promoting proliferation and Th1/2 cells polarization toward Th1 in activated CD4 + T cells by inhibiting the TGFβ/Smad3 pathway.
