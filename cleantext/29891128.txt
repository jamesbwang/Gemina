  Common corrective osteotomies used in flexible flatfoot deformity reconstruction include Cotton and Evans osteotomies , which require structural graft to maintain correction. Auto- , allo- , and xenografts are associated with a number of limitations , including disease transmission , rejection , donor site morbidity , technical challenges related to graft fashioning , and graft resorption. Porous titanium is a synthetic substance designed to address these flaws; however , few studies have been reported on the efficacy , safety , and long-term outcomes. A multicenter retrospective cohort of 63 consecutive preconfigured porous titanium wedges ( PTWs) used in flexible flatfoot reconstructions from June 1 , 2009 to June 30 , 2015 was evaluated. The primary outcome measure was the pre- to postdeformity correction efficacy. The secondary outcomes included maintenance of correction at a minimum follow-up point of 12 months , complications , graft incorporation , and graft safety profile. Multivariate linear regression found a statistically significant improvement in all radiographic parameters from preoperatively to the final weightbearing radiographs ( calcaneocuboid 18.850 ± 4.020 SE , p < .0001; Kite 's , 7.810 ± 3.660 SE , p = .04; Meary 's 13.910 ± 3.100 SE , p = .0001; calcaneal inclination , 5.550 ± 2.140 SE , p = .015). When restricted to patients with > 4 years of follow-up data , maintenance of correction appeared robust in all 4 measurements , demonstrating a lack of bone or graft resorption. No patients were lost to follow-up , no major complications or implant explantation or migration occurred , and all implants were incorporated. Minor complications included hardware pain from plates over grafts ( 8 %) , 1 case of scar neuritis , and a 5 % table incidence of transfer pain associated with the PTWs. These results support the use of PTWs for safety and degree and maintenance of correction in flatfoot reconstruction.
