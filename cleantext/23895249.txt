  Energy-efficient production of water from desert air has not been developed. A proof-of-concept device for harvesting water at low relative humidity was reported; however , it used external cooling and was not desert-tested. We report a laboratory-to-desert experiment where a prototype using up to 1.2 kg of metal-organic framework ( MOF) -801 was tested in the laboratory and later in the desert of Arizona , USA. It produced 100 g of water per kilogram of MOF-801 per day-and-night cycle , using only natural cooling and ambient sunlight as a source of energy. We also report an aluminum-based MOF-303 , which delivers more than twice the amount of water. The desert experiment uncovered key parameters pertaining to the energy , material , and air requirements for efficient production of water from desert air , even at a subzero dew point.
