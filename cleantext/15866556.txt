  This study used canonical correlation analysis to investigate patterns of shared variance between parameters measured in seven different occulomotor function tasks , namely the visually guided saccade task , the antisaccade task , the closed-loop smooth-pursuit task , the open-loop smooth-pursuit task , and three active visual fixation tasks. These tasks were performed by 2130 young army recruits. Only a small percentage ( 1-10 %) of shared variance existed between sets of parameters for all oculomotor function tasks measured. The most correlated tasks were the visually guided saccade and the antisaccade. The first common factor correlated with speed of performance between these tasks ( latency) , while the second and third correlated with accuracy of performance. Better performance in active visual fixation tasks correlated with better performance accuracy ( lower error rate) and increased speed ( lower latency) in the antisaccade and saccade tasks as well as better performance in the closed-loop smooth-pursuit task ( increase in gain and decrease in the rate of unwanted saccades during pursuit). Better performance in the closed-loop smooth-pursuit task ( increased gain and decreased number of unwanted saccades) also correlated with increased accuracy and increased speed of performing saccades and antisaccades. Finally , the open-loop fixation task had no correlation with all other oculomotor tasks except for a very weak negative correlation with the closed-loop pursuit task where better performance ( increased gain) in one correlated with worse performance ( decreased gain) in the other. The results of this analysis showed that a small percentage of variance is shared among different oculomotor function tasks. The structure of this shared variance could be used to derive common oculomotor function indices to study their relation to genetic and other sources of inter-subject variation.
