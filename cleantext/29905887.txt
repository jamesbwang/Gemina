  To analyse if BCG treatment leads to long-term reduction of recurrence , progression , and cancer-specific mortality ( CSM) in patients with high-risk NMIBC. 140 patients with high-risk NMIBC were drawn from a population-based cohort of 538 patients with newly diagnosed bladder cancer in the Stockholm County between 1995 and 1996. Data were collected prospectively , and a final follow-up for recurrence , progression , and CSM was performed after 15 years. Patients that received BCG were compared with patients who did not receive BCG. Survival analysis was done with Kaplan-Meier estimates and Mantel-Cox log-rank test. Multivariable Cox proportional regression with stepwise selection was performed to verify the statistical significance of clinicopathological factors of prognostic importance. Results were displayed in Hazard ratios and a p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. With a median follow-up of 100 months ( 2-182) , 76 patients recurred; 50 progressed to muscle invasion; and 92 died of whom 38 died from bladder cancer. After 15-year follow-up , there was a statistically significant reduction in rate for recurrence ( HR 0.40 , p < 0.0001) and progression ( HR 0.52 , p = 0.038) , but not for CSM , in patients that received BCG compared to those who did not. In this group , BCG in high-risk NMIBC patients reduced the long-term risk of recurrence and progression. The effect on CSM is yet to be clarified.
