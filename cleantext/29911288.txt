  The number of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells ( HSPCs) circulating in peripheral blood ( PB) is regulated by a circadian rhythm , and more HSPCs circulate in PB in the morning hours than at night. Different mechanisms have been proposed that might regulate this process , including changes in tonus of Î²-adrenergic innervation of bone<disease> marrow ( BM) tissue. Our group reported that in mice circadian changes in the number of HSPCs circulating in PB correlates with diurnal activation of the complement cascade ( ComC) and that the mice deficient in C5 component of ComC ( C5-KO mice) do not show circadian changes in the number of circulating HSPCs in PB. We also reported the existence of a gradient between PB and BM of a bioactive phosphosphingolipid , sphingosine-1-phosphate ( S1P) , which is a major PB chemottractant for BM-residing HSPCs. Based on these observations , we investigated activation of the ComC and the level of S1P in the PB of 66 healthy volunteers. We found that both ComC activation and the S1P level undergo changes in a circadian cycle. While the ComC becomes highly activated during deep sleep at 2 am , S1P becomes activated later , and its highest level is observed at 8 am , which precedes circadian egress of HSPCs from BM into PB. In sum , circadian activation of the ComC-S1P axis releases HSPCs from BM into PB.
