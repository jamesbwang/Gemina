  Interruptions can adversely impact human performance , particularly in fast-paced and high-risk environments such as the emergency department ( ED). Understanding physician behaviors before , during , and after interruptions is important to the design and promotion of safe and effective workflow solutions. However , traditional human factors-based interruption models do not accurately reflect the complexities of real-world environments like the ED and may not capture multiple interruptions and multitasking. We present a more comprehensive framework for understanding interruptions that is composed of three phases , each with multiple levels: interruption start transition , interruption engagement , and interruption end transition. This three-phase framework is not constrained to discrete task transitions , providing a robust method to categorize multitasking behaviors around interruptions. We apply this framework in categorizing 457 interruption episodes. A total of 457 interruption episodes were captured during 36 hours of observation. The interrupted task was immediately suspended 348 ( 76.1 %) times. Participants engaged in new self-initiated tasks during the interrupting task 164 ( 35.9 %) times and did not directly resume the interrupted task in 284 ( 62.1 %) interruption episodes. Using this framework provides a more detailed description of physician behaviors in complex environments. Understanding the different types of interruption and resumption patterns , which may have a different impact on performance , can support the design of interruption mitigation strategies.
