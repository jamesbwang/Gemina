  Hypothermia<symptom> is a method of myocardial protection in cardiac surgery. This protection occurs by decreasing the metabolic demands , however , it creates susceptibility to various problems. In this study , we investigated patients operated on under normothermia ( at the patient 's own temperature) and hypothermia<symptom> for postoperative differences. The study was conducted between June 2015 and September 2016 with 167 patients. The patients were divided into two groups in accordance with our routine clinical practice: the normothermic group ( native temperature goup; intraoperative body temperature ≥ 34 °C) , and the hypothermic group intraoperative body temperature < 34 °C- ≥ 28 °C). Preoperative and postoperative data of patients were recorded and the two groups were compared. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of cross clamp time , cardiopulmonary bypass time , awakening and extubation times , intensive care unit and hospital stay , drainage , mean serum lactate levels , arrhytmia , all causes infection , renal insufficiency , neurologic complications , myocardial infarction , or mortality ( P > .05). Inotrope and transfusion requirements were found to be statistically significantly lower in the normothermic group than the hypothermic group ( P < .05). Although hypothermia<symptom> is commonly used in cardiac surgery , it has harmful effects. We believe that cardiac surgery can safely be performed at a patient 's own temperature without active cooling to avoid these dangers.
