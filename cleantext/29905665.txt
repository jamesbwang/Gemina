  Research has extensively identified empathic skills as essential in health trainings , policies , and recommendations. However , there have been conflicting views of the impact of empathy on burnout. Some studies contend that empathy serves a protective role , whereas other studies have shown that burnout leads to a diminished capacity to empathize. To date , studies have not yet explored whether defense styles mediate associations between empathy and burnout. A total of 442 nurses completed questionnaire measures of empathy , burnout , and defense mechanisms as part of a large-scale research study on nurse burnout. Findings reflected very high levels of emotional exhaustion<symptom> and depersonalization among the nursing staff. The nurses in this study endorsed a predominantly immature defense style. In addition , immature defense styles mediated the association between empathy and emotional exhaustion<symptom> and between empathy and depersonalization. The study provides further knowledge about the role of defense styles in nurse burnout and empathy.
