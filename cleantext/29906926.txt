  This paper reveals the effect of fractional Gaussian noise with Hurst exponent H ∈ ( 1/2 ,1) on the information capacity of a general nonlinear neuron model with binary signal input. The fGn and its corresponding fractional Brownian motion exhibit long-range , strong-dependent increments. It extends standard Brownian motion to many types of fractional processes found in nature , such as the synaptic noise. In the paper , for the subthreshold binary signal , sufficient conditions are given based on the `` forbidden interval '' theorem to guarantee the occurrence of stochastic resonance , while for the suprathreshold binary signal , the simulated results show that additive fGn with Hurst exponent H ∈ ( 1/2 ,1) could increase the mutual information or bits count. The investigation indicated that the synaptic noise with the characters of long-range dependence and self-similarity might be the driving factor for the efficient encoding and decoding of the nervous system.
