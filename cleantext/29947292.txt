  Scientists have sought to uncover the genetic bases of many diseases and disorders. In response , scholars defined `` geneticization '' to describe genetic infiltration of understandings of health and illness. In our research , we interviewed 63 individuals in addiction treatment programs to identify what form of geneticization best fits individuals ' description of their own addiction. Individuals ' narratives of their lives , which include family history and are influenced by cultural and structural factors , affect respondents ' reactions to a potential genetic basis of addiction. Most who had a family history of addiction subscribed to a notion that addiction `` runs in families , '' while most who lacked a family history of addiction used this fact to reject the notion of genetic inheritance of addiction. We conclude that though we see elements of several different versions of geneticization , Nikolas Rose 's version , that genetics affects peoples ' perceptions of addiction in small but important ways , best describes our respondents ' views.
