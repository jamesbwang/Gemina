  This study aimed to determine the optimum concentration of trehalose in solutions used for vitrification of in vitro matured ( IVM) ovine oocytes. IVM oocytes were randomly divided into four experimental ( vitrified) and one control ( fresh) groups. Experimental groups were treated with different concentrations ( 0.0 , 0.25 , 0.5 and 1.0 M) of trehalose. After warming , some viable oocytes were exposed to 0.25 % pronase to test zona pellucida hardening , whereas the others were fertilized and cultured in vitro for 8 days to evaluate their developmental competence. Blastocysts quality was assessed by differential staining and TUNEL test. Survival and developmental rates of oocytes vitrified in the presence of 0.5 M trehalose were significantly higher than those of the other vitrified groups. Furthermore , there was a significant difference between fresh and vitrified groups in total blastocyst rate. Analysis of blastocysts quality also revealed a significant difference between the group treated with 0.5 M trehalose and other groups in terms of apoptotic index. Furthermore , zona pellucida digestion time period was longer in trehalose-free ( 0.0 M) group compared to other groups. In conclusion , we found that IVM ovine oocytes vitrified in solutions containing 0.5 M trehalose are fertilization-competent and are able to produce good-quality blastocysts with an apoptotic index comparable to that of the fresh oocytes. Therefore , 0.5 M may be considered the optimum concentration of trehalose to be used in solutions prepared for vitrification of oocytes.
