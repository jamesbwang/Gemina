  Tenets of chest wall reconstruction for malignancy are well known; however , the insertion of synthetic prosthetic material to achieve rigid and nonrigid skeletal reconstruction could be associated with more complications including infection and extrusion especially in high risk patients. This includes fungating , infected tumors , previous radiotherapy , scars , smoking , diabetes , and morbid obesity. Bioprosthesis Acelluar Dermal Matrix Strattice would be a substitute to resist infection and provide stable coverage. A retrospective data analysis study on 8 high-risk patients who underwent chest wall resection and reconstruction with bioprosthesis ( Strattice) with/without titanium plates in the period between 2012 and 2017 was performed. Patient 's demographics , risk factors , clinico-pathological , radiological , operative details , adjuvant therapy , postoperative morbidity , and follow-up data were recorded. Sarcoma<disease> was the pathology in 7 and recurrent breast cancer in 1 with age range from 21 to 71 years ( mean , 50) and preponderance of female patients ( n = 5). Defects were located anterior/anterolateral with size ranging from 270 to 1,050 cm Strattice would act as a safe alternative modality for chest wall reconstruction to resist infection in high-risk patients with extensive defects. It should be considered as a valuable tool in the armamentarium of chest wall reconstruction.
