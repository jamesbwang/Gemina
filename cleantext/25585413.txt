  We designed this study to prove the efficacy of the low-cost Kinect-based virtual rehabilitation ( VR) system for upper limb recovery among patients with subacute stroke. A double-blind , randomized , sham-controlled trial was performed. A total of 23 subjects with subacute stroke ( < 3 months) were allocated to sham ( n = 11) and real VR group ( n = 12). Both groups participated in a daily 30-minute occupational therapy for upper limb recovery for 10 consecutive weekdays. Subjects received an additional daily 30-minute Kinect-based or sham VR. Assessment was performed before the VR , immediately and 1 month after the last session of VR. Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( FMA) ( primary outcome) and other secondary functional outcomes were measured. Accelerometers were used to measure hemiparetic upper limb<symptom> movements<symptom> during the therapy. FMA immediately after last VR session was not different between the sham ( 46.8 ± 16.0) and the real VR group ( 49.4 ± 14.2) ( P = .937 in intention to treat analysis). Significant differences of total activity counts ( TAC) were found in hemiparetic upper limb during the therapy between groups ( F2 ,26 = 4.43; P = .22). Real VR group ( 107,926 ± 68,874) showed significantly more TACs compared with the sham VR group ( 46,686 ± 25,814) but there was no statistical significance between real VR and control ( 64,575 ± 27,533). Low-cost Kinect-based upper limb rehabilitation system was not more efficacious compared with sham VR. However , the compliance in VR was good and VR system induced more arm motion than control and similar activity compared with the conventional therapy , which suggests its utility as an adjuvant additional therapy during inpatient stroke rehabilitation.
