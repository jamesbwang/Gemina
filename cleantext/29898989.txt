  MLH1 is a major tumour suppressor gene involved in the pathogenesis of Lynch syndrome<disease> and various sporadic cancers. Despite their potential pathogenic importance , genomic regions capable of regulating Here we use chromosome conformation capture ( 3C) to screen a 650-kb region flanking the A 1.8 kb DNA fragment , 35kb upstream of the A CTCF bound region within the
