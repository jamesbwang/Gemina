  Malignant tumors composed of both epithelial and melanocytic populations are exceedingly rare. Because the etiology of these malignant tumors is not yet defined , several authors have argued for the continued cataloging of these lesions<symptom>. We present a 67-year-old man with a suspicious-appearing lesion<symptom> on the right forearm; initial biopsy was consistent with a pigmented basal cell carcinoma. On re-excision , a collision of malignant melanoma and basal cell was identified.
