  The aim of this study was to investigate the association of gait speed and gait variability , an index of how much gait parameters , such as step time , fluctuate step-to-step , with risk of cognitive decline in cognitively normal elderly individuals. While high gait variability is emerging as an early indicator of dementing illnesses , there is little research on whether high gait variability predicts cognitive decline in cognitively normal elderly who have no evidence of cognitive impairment. In this 4-year prospective cohort study on 91 community-dwelling cognitively normal elderly individuals without cerebral ischemic burden or Parkinsonism , we evaluated gait speed and step time variability using a tri-axial accelerometer placed on the center of body mass , and diagnosed mild cognitive impairment ( MCI) according to the International Working Group on MCI. We performed Kaplan-Meier analysis with consecutive log-rank testing for MCI-free survival by cohort-specific tertiles of gait speed; hazard ratios ( HR) of incident MCI were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for age , sex , education level , Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score , GDS score , and presence of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele. Out of the 91 participants in the baseline assessment , 87 completed one or more 2-year follow-up assessments , and the median duration of follow-up was 47.1 months. Kaplan-Meier curves of incident MCI show evident differences in risk by gait variability group ( χ2 = 9.64 , p = 0.002 , log-rank test). Mean MCI-free survival in the high variability group was 12 % shorter than in the mid-to-low tertile group ( 47.4 ± 1.74 ( SD) vs. 54.04 ± 0.52 months) , while it was comparable between gait speed groups ( 51.59 ± 0.70 vs. 50.64 ± 1.77 months; χ2 = 1.16 , p = 0.281). In multivariate analysis , subjects with high gait variability showed about 12-fold higher risk of MCI ( HR = 11.97 , 95 % CI = 1.29-111.37) than those with mid-to-low variability. However , those with slow gait speed showed comparable MCI risk to those with mid-to-high speed ( HR = 5.04 , 95 % CI = 0.53-48.18). Gait variability may be a better predictor of cognitive decline than gait speed in cognitively normal elderly individuals without cerebral ischemic burden or Parkinsonism.
