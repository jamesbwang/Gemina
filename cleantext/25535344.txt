  Salt stress in plants triggers complex physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> that are genotype specific. Many of these responses are either not yet described or not fully understood or both. In this work , we phenotyped three maize genotypes of the CIMMYT gene bank alongside the reference B73 genotype ( NCRPIS- United States) under both control and salt-stressed conditions. We have ranked their growth potential and we observed significant differences in Na
