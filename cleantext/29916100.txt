  The aim of the study was to assess cytogenetic and embryoscopic characteristics in subsequent miscarriages of spontaneous pregnancy losses ( SPL) and recurrent pregnancy losses ( RPL). A retrospective cohort of 75 women was affected by repeated pregnancy loss. Of those , 34 had SPL , 24 primary RPL , and 17 secondary RPL. Ploidy status and morphology was analyzed by transcervical embryoscopic examination of the embryo and cytogenetic analysis of the chorionic villi in subsequent miscarriages. Similar rates of recurrent ploidy status were observed between first and second miscarriage in SPL and RPL ( 82.4 % recurrent ploidy status in SPL , p > 0.999; 73 % recurrent ploidy status in RPL , p = 0.227). No difference was found regarding recurrent abnormal morphology between SPL and RPL ( p = 0.092). However , secondary RPL resulted significantly more often in recurrent abnormal morphology compared to primary RPL ( p = 0.004). High rates of recurrent normal/abnormal karyotypes were observed in all groups with a majority of embryos presenting with recurrent abnormal morphology. Secondary RPL presented significantly more often with recurrent abnormal morphology compared to primary RPL. These findings offer prognostic information for the affected patient and might impact treatment choice.
