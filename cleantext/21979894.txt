  To investigate the relationship between hypoxia-inducible factor-1α ( HIF-1α) , prolyl 4-hydroxylase beta ( P4HB) expression , and clinicopathologic parameters , as well as the prognostic value of these genes for patients with gastric cancer ( GC). Hypoxia is a critical factor that shapes the GC microenvironment. In previous reports , we have demonstrated that P4HB is a potential target of HIF-1α. In the present study , gene expression profiling interactive analysis ( GEPIA) was used to analyze the relationship between P4HB and hypoxia-associated genes. To this end , 428 GC tissue samples were used to analyze the expression of HIF-1α and P4HB P4HB demonstrated a positive correlation with hypoxia-associated genes ( Overexpression of HIF-1α and P4HB is associated with poor prognosis in patients with GC. Thus , these genes may be potential prognostic biomarker candidates in GC.
