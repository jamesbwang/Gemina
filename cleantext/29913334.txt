  Abnormal placentation often requires the involvement of a multidisciplinary team of medical caregivers. Practicing Obstetrics is a challenging and skillful duty. This is more obvious in cases of abnormal placentation , which represents one of the most dangerous and complex clinical conditions in materno-fetal medicine. Pathological placentation involves position and invasion abnormalities and represents a serious and potentially life-threatening condition for both the pregnant woman and the fetus. The dramatic increase in cesarean section rates is an important factor which could explain the rapid raise in abnormal placentation cases , which were considered rare a few years ago. Nevertheless , the scientific armamentarium sometimes seems to be poor and this could be explained by the fact that treatment options are offered too late , since this condition is often detected late , entailing higher patients ' risks. In fact , the later the diagnosis is made the poorer the prognosis is for cases of abnormal placentation. Given that abnormal placentation is constantly increasing , the scientific community should aim at early diagnosis and appropriate management of such cases based on the best evidence available. Future improvement of knowledge and practice lies in perspective , preferably randomized studies so that we obtain high quality of evidence which is still needed. The purpose of this study is to review the current literature and to update the available scientific knowledge on the topic of abnormal placentation which is an emerging issue which clinicians should learn to deal with , considering its continuous increase in the last years.
