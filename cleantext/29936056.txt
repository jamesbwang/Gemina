  In the present study , we aimed to determine the prognostic impact and clinicopathological feature of FGF4 amplification in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC). Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) with FGF4 probe was analyzed using tissue microarray consisting of representative cores of 267 ESCC cases. FGF4 amplification was observed in 52.8 % ( 141/267) of patients. Patients with FGF4 amplification showed a significantly shorter disease free survival ( DFS) or disease-specific overall survival ( OS) compared with those without FGF4 amplification ( both P < 0.05). Moreover , FGF4 amplification was an independent prognostic factor ( DFS , P = 0.036 and OS , P = 0.021) along with clinical stage and lymph node metastasis in multivariate analysis. Among stage I-II or III patients whose DFS was greater than or equal to 24 months ( n = 125 or 32) , patients with FGF4 amplification showed a significantly worse prognosis ( OS , P = 0.027 or 0.010). Moreover , the survival curve of stage I-II patients with FGF4 amplification was identical to stage III patients without FGF4 amplification ( DFS , P = 0.643; OS , P = 0.707). Taken together , FGF4 amplification was an independent prognostic factor in ESCC patients , and ESCC might have potentially been up-staged by FGF4 amplification. Therefore , FGF4 amplification in combination with clinical stage could be used as a relatively accurate predictor for the 5-year probability of death and recurrence for ESCC patients.
