  Ossifying fibroma is a benign osteogenic mesenchymal tumor that is classified in the fibro-osseous lesions<symptom>. Fibro-osseous lesions<symptom> contain minerals , blood vessels , and giant cells that have the same radiographic and pathologic features but have different clinical behaviors , and were replaced with the normal bone. These lesions<symptom> include fibrous dysplasia , cemento-osseous dysplasia , and ossifying fibroma. Juvenile ossifying fibroma is a type of uncommon and has invasive behavior , high incidence and occurs in young men , especially in maxilla , and is different from the type of adult in age , location , and clinical behavior and microscopic view. Pathologically , ossifying fibroma is divided into two types of trabecular and psammomatoid. The trabecular type is characterized by the presence of the osteoid trabeculae and the woven bone , and the type of psammomatoid by the presence of round , integrated , and small ossicles that are similar to the components of the psammoma. The purpose of this report is the clinical examination , radiography , pathology , and the treatment of a rare case of ossifying fibroma ( trabecular) in mandible in a 7-year-old boy.
