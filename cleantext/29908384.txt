  Up to 30-50 % of individuals with epilepsy have depressive symptoms , which often complicate seizure<symptom> management and reduce overall quality of life. To identify and manage depressive symptoms appropriately , clinicians need standardized instruments that can accurately identify and monitor those with clinically significant depression<symptom> The self-reported 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9) has been used relatively widely to screen and monitor depression<symptom> in epilepsy. The rater-administered Montgomery-Asberg Depression<symptom> Rating Scale ( MADRS) is a rater-administered instrument widely used in depression<symptom> treatment trials but less widely applied in epilepsy. This secondary analysis from 2 epilepsy self-management clinical trials compared depression<symptom> severity ratings using the PHQ-9 and the MADRS instruments. Data for this analysis were derived from pooled baseline and longitudinal data from 2 prospective epilepsy self-management randomized controlled trials ( RCTs). Both RCTs assessed depression<symptom> with the PHQ-9 and the MADRS. For this analysis , total depression<symptom> severity scores and case classification of individuals with no/minimal , mild , moderate/moderately severe , and severe<symptom> depression<symptom> were assessed using both PHQ-9 and MADRS. The sample contained 164 individuals with epilepsy. Demographic and clinical variables between the 2 studies were generally similar. There were 107 women ( 64.8 %) , 106 African-Americans ( 64.2 %) , and 51 Whites ( 30.9 %). Individuals had epilepsy for an average of 22.1 ( SD: 15.5). Mean past 30-day seizure<symptom> frequency at baseline was 3.1 ( SD: 11.6). Baseline mean PHQ-9 was 10.7 ( SD: 6.80) with depression<symptom> severity of 32 ( 19.6 %) not or minimally depressed , 47 ( 28.8 %) mildly depressed , 37 ( 22.7 %) moderately depressed , 27 ( 16.6 %) moderately severely depressed , and 20 ( 12.3 %) severely depressed. Baseline mean MADRS severity was 18.5 ( SD: 11.3) with 30 ( 18.8 %) not or minimally depressed , 27 ( 16.9 %) mildly depressed , 92 ( 56.1 %) moderately depressed , and 11 ( 6.9 %) severely depressed. The correlation between total PHQ-9 and total MADRS was 0.843 ( p < .01) although case classification by depression<symptom> severity varied somewhat between the two instruments. Standardized measures to evaluate depression<symptom> severity in people with epilepsy can help identify cases and monitor treatment. The PHQ-9 and MADRS both perform well in assessing depression<symptom> in people with epilepsy although administration burden is less with PHQ-9 thus making it likely preferable for settings where time and epilepsy specialty resources are limited.
