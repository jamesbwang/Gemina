  Poly-L-lactic acid ( PLLA) is a synthetic , biocompatible , biodegradable polymer. For soft-tissue augmentation , the size and chemical attributes of the PLLA microparticles are central to this agent 's ability to promote a subclinical inflammatory response that stimulates deposition of collagen in the extracellular matrix. The resultant restoration of facial volume occurs in a controlled , predictable manner and is long lasting. The unique physiochemical and biostimulatory properties of PLLA differentiate it from other available treatments and are the foundation of the unique treatment methodology required for optimal results.
