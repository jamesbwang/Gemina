  Although higher-protein diets ( HP) can assist with weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and glycemic control , their effect on psychological wellbeing has not been established. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of a HP and a higher-carbohydrate diet ( HC) , combined with regular exercise , on psychological wellbeing both during weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( WL) and weight maintenance phases ( WM). In a parallel RCT , 61 adults with T2D ( mean ± SD: BMI 34.3 ± 5.1 kg/m Independent of diet , improvements for PAID; D-39 diabetes control; D-39 severity of diabetes; SF-36 physical functioning and SF-36 general health were found following WL ( d = 0.30 to 0.69 , P ≤ 0.04 for all) which remained after 12 weeks of WM. SF-36 vitality improved more in the HP group ( group x time interaction P = 0.03). Associations were seen between HbA1c and D-39 severity of diabetes rating ( r = 0.30 , P = 0.01) and SF-36 mental health ( r =- 0.32 , P = 0.003) and between weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and PAID ( r = 0.30 , P = 0.01). Several improvements in diabetes-related and general psychological wellbeing were seen similarly for both diets following weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and a reduction in HbA1c with most of these improvements remaining when weight<symptom> loss<symptom> was sustained for 12 weeks. A HP diet may provide additional increases in vitality. The trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( ACTRN 12613000008729) on 4 January 2013.
