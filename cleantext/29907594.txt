  Docetaxel resistance remains a major obstacle in the treatment of prostate cancer ( PCa) bone metastasis. In this study , we demonstrate that the dopamine D2 receptor ( DRD2) agonist bromocriptine effectively enhances docetaxel efficacy and suppresses skeletal growth of PCa in preclinical models. DRD2 is ubiquitously expressed in PCa cell lines , and DRD2 is significantly reduced in PCa tissues with high Gleason score. Bromocriptine has weak to moderate cytotoxicity in PCa cells , but effectively induces cell cycle arrest. At the molecular level , bromocriptine inhibits the expression of c-Myc , E2F-1 and survivin , and increases the expression of p53 , p21 and p27. Intriguingly , bromocriptine markedly reduces androgen receptor ( AR) levels , partially through heat-shock protein 90 ( Hsp90)- mediated protein degradation. The combination of bromocriptine and docetaxel demonstrates enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity in PCa cells and significantly retards the skeletal growth of C4-2-Luc tumors in mice. Collectively , these results provide the first experimental evidence for repurposing bromocriptine as an effective adjunct therapy to enhance docetaxel efficacy in PCa.
