  Many protein-based materials , such as soy and mussel adhesive proteins , have been the subject of scientific and commercial interest. Recently , a variety of protein adhesives have been isolated from diverse sources such as insects , frogs and squid ring teeth. Many of these adhesives have similar amino acid compositions to elastomeric proteins such as elastin. Although elastin is widely investigated for a structural biomaterial , little work has been done to assess its adhesive potential. In this study , recombinant elastin-like polypeptides were created to probe the factors affecting adhesion strength. Lap shear adhesion was used to examine the effects of both extrinsic factors ( pH , concentration , cross-linker , humidity , cure time and cure temperature) and intrinsic factors ( protein sequence , structure and molecular weight). Of the extrinsic factors tested , only humidity , cure time and cure temperature had a significant effect on adhesion strength. As water content was reduced , adhesion strength increased. Of the intrinsic factors tested , amino acid sequence did not significantly affect adhesion strength , but less protein structure and higher molecular weights increased adhesion strength directly. The strengths of proteins in this study ( greater than 2 MPa) were comparable to or higher than those of two commercially available protein-based adhesives , hide glue and a fibrin sealant. These results may provide general rules for the design of adhesives from elastomeric proteins.
