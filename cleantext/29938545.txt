  A new pharmacological class , Janus kinases ( JAK) inhibitors , has been shown to be effective and safe for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases ( IBDs). The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the JAK inhibitors currently under investigation in phase I and II clinical trials for patients with Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis<disease> and the possible future perspectives for the treatment of IBD patients with this class of drugs. Areas covered: This review describes the JAK-STAT pathway and analyzes the efficacy and safety of new small molecules such as filgotinib , upadacitinib , TD-1473 , peficitinib , and Pf-06651600/ Pf-06700841 , showing data from phase I and II trials. Expert Opinion: JAK inhibitors , if approved by the regulatory authorities , could represent a novel and intriguing drug class. In the next years , the approach to patients with IBD will become increasingly personalized.
