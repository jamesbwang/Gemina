  Optimizing functional outcomes and disability status are essential for effective surgical treatment of cervical spine disorders. Mental<symptom> impairment<symptom> is common among patients with cervical spine complaints; yet little is known about the impact of baseline mental<symptom> status<symptom> with respect to overall patient-reported outcomes. This was a retrospective analysis of patients with cervical spondylosis with myelopathy ( CM) or radiculopathy ( CR: cervical disc herniation , stenosis , or spondylosis without myelopathy) at 2-year follow-ups. Patients were assessed for several health-related quality of life HRQOL) measures at baseline and 24-months post-operatively: Neck Disability Index ( NDI) , Visual Analog Scale ( VAS) , Short Form-36 ( SF) Physical ( PCS) and Mental ( MCS) Components. Patients were dichotomized by MCS score: LOW-MCS ( SF-MCS < 40th percentile) vs. HIGH-MCS ( SF-MCS > 60th percentile). Independent and paired t-tests compared improvement in each group for HIGH-MCS and LOW-MCS cohorts. 375 patients were analyzed ( 65.4 yrs , 67.6 % F). LOW-MCS radiculopathy patients showed significant improvement in NDI , VAS Neck and Arm<symptom> Pain<symptom> ( p < 0.05). HIGH-MCS radiculopathy patients showed greater improvement in NDI score , VAS Neck and Arm<symptom> Pain<symptom> , and improvement in PCS ( all p < 0.05). Comparing baseline and 2-year follow-up , LOW-MCS CM patients showed significant improvement in PCS , NDI , VAS Neck and Arm<symptom> Pain<symptom> ( p < 0.05). HIGH-MCS myelopathy patients group showed marked improvement in NDI scores , VAS Neck and Arm<symptom> Pain<symptom> ( p < 0.05). LOW-MCS CR patients were more likely to be less satisfied 2-years post-op ( p < 0.001). Postoperative CR patients with lower baseline mental<symptom> status<symptom> saw less improvement and significantly worse outcomes than patients with higher baseline mental<symptom> status<symptom>. Improving baseline mental health may improve post-operative recovery. Implementing additional screening and care can optimize functional outcomes and disability status for patients with CR.
