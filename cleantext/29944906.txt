  Chronic myelogenous leukemia<disease> ( CML) accounts for 15-20 % of all leukemias<disease> affecting adults. Despite recent advances in the development of specific Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs) , some CML patients suffer from relapse due to TKI resistance. Here , we assessed the efficacy of a novel combinatorial arsenic trioxide ( ATO) and cisplatin ( CDDP) treatment ( Ato-C) in human Bcr-Abl-positive leukemic cells. Combination index analyses revealed that a synergistic interaction of ATO and CDDP elicits a wide range of effects in K562 , KU-812 , MEG-A2 , and KCL-22 cells. Notably , Ato-C synergistically enhanced apoptosis and decreased the survival of both acquired TKI-resistant CML cells and the cells expressing mutant Bcr-Abl
