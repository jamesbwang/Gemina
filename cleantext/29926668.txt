  To detect the levels of miR-1 , miR-21 and their targeted proteins in hearts of mice after different exercise training , and discuss potential molecular mechanism. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided to 3 groups: sedentary ( SE) , exercise training 1 ( ET1) and exercise training 2 ( ET2). SE did not do any exercise; ET1 undertook swimming training for 8 weeks , once a day , 5 days/week. Swimming 30 min in the 1 Compared with SE , in ET1 , myocardial apoptosis and miR-1 level did not change , but its targeted protein Bcl-2 increased significantly ( Exercise training in ET2 other than ET1 could down-regulate myocardial apoptosis. Alterations of miR-1 and Bcl-2 may be responsible for this cardioprotection. PDCD4 is not sensitive to exercise training , it is likely that miR-21 and other targeted proteins participate in exercise-regulative apoptosis.
