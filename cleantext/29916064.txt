  Cystic echinococcosis is a zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution caused by the larval stage of the Cestode parasite Echinococcus granulosus<pathogen> sensu lato. Due to the predominance or even the exclusive presence of E. granulosus<pathogen> sensu stricto ( s.s.) among E. granulosus<pathogen> species in many areas , the genetic diversity needs to be further investigated at the species level to better understand the inter- and intra-focus epidemiological features. Short sequences of mitochondrial or nuclear genes generally lack or have limited discriminatory power , hindering the detection of polymorphisms to reflect geographically based peculiarities and/or any history of infection. A high discriminatory power can only be reached by sequencing complete or near complete mitogenomes or relatively long nuclear sequences , which is time-consuming and onerous. To overcome this issue , a systematic research for single-locus microsatellites was performed on the nuclear genome of E. granulosus s.s. in order to investigate its intra-species genetic diversity. Two microsatellites , EgSca6 and EgSca11 , were selected and characterized. The test of a panel of 75 cystic echinococcosis samples revealed a very high discrimination index of 0.824 for EgSca6 , 0.987 for EgSca11 , and 0.994 when multiplexing both microsatellites. Testing cystic echinococcosis samples from both liver and lungs in five sheep revealed that these two microsatellites appear to be of particular interest for investigating genetic diversity at the intra-individual host level. As this method has many advantages compared to classical sequencing , the availability of other targets means that it is potentially possible to constitute a panel facilitating large-scale molecular epidemiology studies for E. granulosus s.l.
