  Epilepsia partialis continua ( EPC) is a special form of cortical epilepsy. Several studies have described the ictal and interictal electroencephalography ( EEG) findings in patients with EPC; however , lateralizing and localizing values of these findings have been evaluated rarely. This study investigated the correlation of semiologic and EEG findings , and outcomes in patients with EPC. Clinical and EEG findings and outcomes , and their correlations were studied prospectively in 15 patients who were diagnosed as having EPC upon presentation to Istanbul Medical Faculty Hospital between January 2010 and April 2014 , and retrospectively in 5 previously evaluated patients. EEG findings were lateralizing in 11 ( 47.8 %) of the overall 23 EEG recordings , 7 ( 30.4 %) of which were also localizing. Eleven ( 55 %) of the 20 patients had poor prognosis. Patients with interictal lateralizing EEG findings had better outcomes compared with patients who had interictal non-lateralizing EEG findings ( P = 0.016). Periodic epileptiform discharges ( PEDs) were noted in the 6 EEGs ( 3 ictal EEGs and 3 interictal EEGs) of 5 patients , all of whom had poor outcomes ( P = 0.04). All four patients with false lateralizing EEG findings had poor outcomes. EEG has low lateralizing and localizing value in EPC but patients with interictal lateralizing EEG findings have better outcomes , which may be used as a prognostic tool in EPC. The presence of PEDs and false lateralizing findings in EEG might be associated with poor prognosis in EPC.
