  π-conjugated organic microcrystals often act as optical resonators in which the generated photons in the crystal are confined by the reflection at the crystalline facets and interfere to gain lasing action. Here , we fabricate microcrystals from a mixture of carbon-bridged oligo- para-phenylenevinylenes ( COPVs) with energy-donor ( D) and energy-acceptor ( A) characters. Upon weak excitation of the single D-A co-crystal , Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET) takes place , exhibiting spontaneous emission from A. In contrast , upon strong pumping , stimulated emission occurs before FRET , generating lasing action from D. Lasing occurs with single- and dual-vibronic levels , and the lasing wavelength can be modulated by the doping amount of A. Time-resolved spectroscopic studies reveal that the rate constant of lasing is more than 20 times greater than that of FRET. Furthermore , microcrystals , vertically grown on a Ag-coated substrate , reduce the lasing threshold by one-fourth. This study proposes possible directions toward organic solid FRET lasers with microcrystalline resonators.
