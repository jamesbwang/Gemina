  Transient receptor potential ( TRP) channels are involved in various physiological processes , including sensory transduction. The TRP channel TRPV6 mediates calcium uptake in epithelia and its expression is dramatically increased in numerous types of cancer. TRPV6 inhibitors suppress tumor growth , but the molecular mechanism of inhibition remains unknown. Here , we present crystal and cryo-EM structures of human and rat TRPV6 bound to 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate ( 2-APB) , a TRPV6 inhibitor and modulator of numerous TRP channels. 2-APB binds to TRPV6 in a pocket formed by the cytoplasmic half of the S1-S4 transmembrane helix bundle. Comparing human wild-type and high-affinity mutant Y467A structures , we show that 2-APB induces TRPV6 channel closure by modulating protein-lipid interactions. Mutagenesis and functional analyses suggest that the identified 2-APB binding site might be present in other members of vanilloid subfamily TRP channels. Our findings reveal a mechanism of ion channel allosteric modulation that can be exploited for therapeutic design.
