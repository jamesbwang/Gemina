  Virions are the vehicle for cell-to-cell and host-to-host transmission of viruses. Virions need to be assembled reliably and efficiently , be released from infected cells , survive in the extracellular environment during transmission , recognize and then trigger entry of appropriate target cells , and disassemble in an orderly manner during initiation of a new infection. The betaherpesvirus<pathogen> subfamily includes four human herpesviruses ( human cytomegalovirus and human herpesviruses 6A , 6B , and 7) , as well as viruses that are the basis of important animal models of infection and immunity. Similar to other herpesviruses , betaherpesvirus<pathogen> virions consist of four main parts ( in order from the inside): the genome , capsid , tegument , and envelope. Betaherpesvirus<pathogen> genomes are dsDNA and range in length from ~ 145 to 240 kb. Virion capsids ( or nucleocapsids) are geometrically well-defined vessels that contain one copy of the dsDNA viral genome. The tegument is a collection of several thousand protein and RNA molecules packed into the space between the envelope and the capsid for delivery and immediate activity upon cellular entry at the initiation of an infection. Betaherpesvirus<pathogen> envelopes consist of lipid bilayers studded with virus-encoded glycoproteins; they protect the virion during transmission and mediate virion entry during initiation of new infections. Here , we summarize the mechanisms of betaherpesvirus<pathogen> virion assembly , including how infection modifies , reprograms , hijacks , and otherwise manipulates cellular processes and pathways to produce virion components , assemble the parts into infectious virions , and then transport the nascent virions to the extracellular environment for transmission.
