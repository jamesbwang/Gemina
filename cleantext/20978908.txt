  Pro-social behaviors are voluntary behaviors that benefit other people or society as a whole , such as charitable donations , cooperation , trust , altruistic punishment , and fairness. These behaviors have been widely described through non self-interest decision-making in behavioral experimental studies and are thought to be increased by social preference motives. Importantly , recent studies using a combination of neuroimaging and brain stimulation , designed to reveal the neural mechanisms of pro-social behaviors , have found that a wide range of brain areas , specifically the prefrontal cortex , anterior insula , anterior cingulate cortex , and amygdala , are correlated or causally related with pro-social behaviors. In this review , we summarize the research on the neural basis of various kinds of pro-social behaviors and describe a common shared neural circuitry of these pro-social behaviors. We introduce several general ways in which experimental economics and neuroscience can be combined to develop important contributions to understanding social decision-making and pro-social behaviors. Future research should attempt to explore the neural circuitry between the frontal lobes and deeper brain areas.
