  The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ( NIEHS) Superfund Basic Research and Training Program ( SRP) funds a wide range of transdisciplinary research projects spanning the biomedical and environmental sciences and engineering , supporting and promoting the application of that research to solving real-world problems. We used a case study approach to identify the economic and societal benefits of SRP-funded research , focusing on the use of potentially hazardous substance remediation and site monitoring tools. We also identified successes and challenges involved in translating SRP grantees ' research findings and advances into application. We identified remediation and detection research projects supported by the SRP with the most potential for economic and societal benefits and selected 36 for analysis. To examine the benefits of these applied technologies , we interviewed 28 SRP-supported researchers and 41 partners. Five case studies emerged with the most complete information on cost savings-total savings estimated at > $ 100 million. Our analysis identified added societal benefits such as creation of small businesses , land and water reuse , sustainable technologies , exposure reduction , and university-industry partnerships. Research funded by the SRP has yielded significant cost savings while providing additional societal benefits. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3534.
