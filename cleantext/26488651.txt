  Polyampholytes are polymers carrying electrical charges of both signs along their backbone. We consider synthetic polyampholytes with a quenched random charge sequence and intrinsically disordered proteins , which have a well-defined charge sequence and behave like polyampholytes in the denaturated state. We study their translocation driven by an electric field through a pore. The role of disorder along the charge sequence of synthetic polyampholytes is analyzed. We show how disorder slows down the translocation dynamics. For intrinsically disordered proteins , the translocation vs. rejection rates by the pore depends on which end is engaged in the translocation channel. We discuss the rejection time , the blockade time distributions and the translocation speed for the charge sequence of two specific intrinsically disordered proteins differing in length and structure.
