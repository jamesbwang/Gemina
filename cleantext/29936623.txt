  As a subjective symptom , cancer-related fatigue<symptom> is assessed via patient-reported outcomes. Due to the inherent bias of such evaluation , screening and treatment for cancer-related fatigue<symptom> remains suboptimal. The purpose is to evaluate whether objective cancer patients ' hand muscle mechanical parameters ( maximal force , critical force , force variability) extracted from a fatiguing handgrip exercise may be correlated to the different dimensions ( physical , emotional , and cognitive) of cancer-related fatigue<symptom>. Fourteen women with advanced breast cancer , still under or having previously received chemotherapy within the preceding 3 months , and 11 healthy women participated to the present study. Cancer-related fatigue<symptom> was first assessed through the EORTC QLQ-30 and its fatigue<symptom> module. Fatigability was then measured during 60 maximal repeated handgrip contractions. The maximum force , critical force ( asymptote of the force-time evolution) , and force variability ( root mean square of the successive differences) were extracted. Multiple regression models were performed to investigate the influence of the force parameters on cancer-related fatigue<symptom> 's dimensions. The multiple linear regression analysis evidenced that physical fatigue<symptom> was best explained by maximum force and critical force ( r = 0.81; p = 0.029). The emotional fatigue<symptom> was best explained by maximum force , critical force , and force variability ( r = 0.83; p = 0.008). The cognitive fatigue<symptom> was best explained by critical force and force variability ( r = 0.62; p = 0.035). The handgrip maximal force , critical force , and force variability may offer objective measures of the different dimensions of cancer-related fatigue<symptom> and could provide a complementary approach to the patient reported outcomes.
