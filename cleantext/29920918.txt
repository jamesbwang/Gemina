  The aim of this study was to evaluate the color stability of two resin-based composites photo-activated by two light curing units ( LCU) with different irradiances. Hundred disc-shaped specimens ( 2-mm thick) of a nanofilled ( FZ- Filtek FZ light-activated by VA showed higher L * and WI The nanofilled composite photo-activated with higher irradiance showed greater L * and WI Initial color of resin-based composites can change after immersion in staining beverages. However , the best color stability was obtained by the nanocomposite photo-activated by a light-curing unit of higher irradiance.
