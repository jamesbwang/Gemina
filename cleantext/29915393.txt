  14-3-3 proteins are a family of structurally similar phospho-binding proteins that regulate essentially every major cellular function. Decades of research on 14-3-3s have revealed a remarkable network of interacting proteins that demonstrate how 14-3-3s integrate and control multiple signaling pathways. In particular , these interactions place 14-3-3 at the center of the signaling hub that governs critical processes in cancer , including apoptosis , cell cycle progression , autophagy , glucose metabolism , and cell motility. Historically , the majority of 14-3-3 interactions have been identified and studied under nutrient-replete cell culture conditions , which has revealed important nutrient driven interactions. However , this underestimates the reach of 14-3-3s. Indeed , the loss of nutrients , growth factors , or changes in other environmental conditions ( e.g. , genotoxic stress) will not only lead to the loss of homeostatic 14-3-3 interactions , but also trigger new interactions , many of which are likely stress adaptive. This dynamic nature of the 14-3-3 interactome is beginning to come into focus as advancements in mass spectrometry are helping to probe deeper and identify context-dependent 14-3-3 interactions-providing a window into adaptive phosphorylation-driven cellular mechanisms that orchestrate the tumor cell 's response to a variety of environmental conditions including hypoxia and chemotherapy. In this review , we discuss emerging 14-3-3 regulatory mechanisms with a focus on post-translational regulation of 14-3-3 and dynamic protein-protein interactions that illustrate 14-3-3 's role as a stress-adaptive signaling hub in cancer.
