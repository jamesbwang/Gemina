  High neighborhood crime and low perceptions of safety may influence blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> through chronic stress. Few studies have examined these associations using longitudinal data. We used longitudinal data from 528 participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ( aged 45-84 , non-hypertensive at baseline) who lived in Chicago , Illinois. We examined associations of changes in individual-level perceived safety , aggregated neighborhood-level perceived safety , and past-year rates of police-recorded crime in a one-mile , half-mile , or quarter-mile buffer per 1,000 population with changes in systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressures<symptom> using fixed-effects linear regression. Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> was measured 5 times between 2000 and 2012 and was adjusted for antihypertensive medication use ( +10 mm Hg added to systolic and +5 mm Hg added to diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> for participants on medication). Models were adjusted for time-varying socio-demographic and health-related characteristics and neighborhood socioeconomic status. We assessed differences by sex. A standard-deviation increase in individual-level perceived safety was associated with a 1.54 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> overall ( 95 % CI: 0.25 , 2.83) , and with a 1.24 mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> among women only ( 95 % CI: 0.37 , 2.12) in adjusted models. Increased neighborhood-level safety was not associated with blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> change. An increase in police-recorded crime was associated with a reduction in systolic and diastolic blood<symptom> pressures<symptom> among women only , but results were sensitive to neighborhood buffer size. Results suggest individual perception of neighborhood safety may be particularly salient for systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> reduction relative to more objective neighborhood exposures.
