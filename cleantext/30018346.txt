  We present two narratives on the future of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean , from the perspective of an observer looking back from 2070. In the first scenario , greenhouse gas emissions remained unchecked , the climate continued to warm , and the policy response was ineffective; this had large ramifications in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean , with worldwide impacts. In the second scenario , ambitious action was taken to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to establish policies that reduced anthropogenic pressure on the environment , slowing the rate of change in Antarctica. Choices made in the next decade will determine what trajectory is realized.
