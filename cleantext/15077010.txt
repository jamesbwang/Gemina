  The aim of this study was to determine whether intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy ( ICP) is associated with causes of death during on average 35 years follow-up after the delivery. The study population comprised 571 women with ICP in at least one pregnancy seen at Tampere University Hospital , Finland , between 1969 and 1988. ICP was verified from patient records. The previous and following subjects in the maternity ward diary were taken as controls for each ICP case. In total , there were 1333 controls. All underlying causes of death were obtained from Statistics Finland in March 2017. The deaths occurred during 1971-2015 and the causes of death were classified according to ICD-10. Altogether , 39 of the mothers with ICP ( 6.8 %) and 111 of the controls ( 8.3 %) had died by the end of 2015 ( p = 0.267). There were more underlying causes of death from gastrointestinal diseases ( 15 %) in the ICP group than in the control group ( 4 %) ( p = 0.011). The number of underlying causes of death due to diseases of the circulatory system were lower in the ICP group ( 13 %) than in the control group ( 26 %) , although the finding was not statistically significant ( p = 0.088). Moreover , neoplasms were the underlying cause of death in 46 % of cases among mothers with ICP and in 41 % of cases among the controls ( p = 0.609). Diseases of the other organ systems were rare in both groups. Women with a history of ICP do not have an increased overall mortality. However , deaths from gastrointestinal diseases are overrepresented among women with a history of ICP.
