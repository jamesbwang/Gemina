  Plants and insects are constantly interacting in complex ways through forest<disease> communities since hundreds of millions of years. Those interactions are often related to variations in the climate. Climate change , due to human activities , may have disturbed these relationships in modern ecosystems. Fossil leaf assemblages are thus good opportunities to survey responses of plant-insect interactions to climate variations over the time. The goal of this study is to discuss the possible causes of the differences of plant-insect interactions ' patterns in European paleoforests from the Neogene-Quaternary transition. This was accomplished through three fossil leaf assemblages: Willershausen , Berga ( both from the late Neogene of Germany) and Bernasso ( from the early Quaternary of France). In Willershausen it has been measured that half of the leaves presented insect interactions , 35 % of the fossil leaves were impacted by insects in Bernasso and only 25 % in Berga. The largest proportion of these interactions in Bernasso were categorized as specialist ( mainly due to galling) while in Willershausen and Berga those ones were significantly more generalist. Contrary to previous studies , this study did not support the hypothesis that the mean annual precipitation and temperature were the main factors that impacted the different plant-insect interactions ' patterns. However , for the first time , our results tend to support that the hydric seasonality and the mean temperature of the coolest months could be potential factors influencing fossil plant-insect interactions.
