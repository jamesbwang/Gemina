  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) allows for a detailed noninvasive visualization/examination of posterior fossa structures and represents a fundamental step in the diagnostic workup of many cerebellar disorders. In the first part of this chapter methodologic issues , like the correct choice of hardware ( magnets , coils) , pro and cons of the different MRI sequences , and patient management during the examination are discussed. In the second part , the MRI anatomy of the cerebellum , as noted on the various conventional MRI sequences , as well as a detailed description of cerebellar maturational processes from birth to childhood and into adulthood , are reported. Volumetric studies on the cerebellar growth based on three-dimensional MRI sequences are also presented. Moreover , we briefly discuss two main topics regarding conventional MRI of the cerebellum that have generated some debate in recent years: the differentiation between cerebellar atrophy , hypoplasia , and pontocerebellar hypoplasia , and signal changes of dentate nuclei after repetitive gadolinium-based contrast injections. The advantages and benefits of advanced neuroimaging techniques , including
