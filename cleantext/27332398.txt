  Nurses are the largest group of health information technology ( HIT) users. As such , nurses ' adaptations are critical for HIT implementation success. However , longitudinal approaches to understanding nurses ' perceptions of HIT remain underexplored. Previous studies of nurses ' perceptions demonstrate that the progress and timing for acceptance of and adaptation to HIT varies. This study aimed to explore nurses ' experience regarding implementation of HIT over time. A phenomenological approach was used for this longitudinal qualitative study to explore nurses ' perceptions of HIT implementation over time , focusing on three time points ( rounds) at 3 , 9 , and 18 months after implementation of electronic health records and bar code medication administration. The purposive sample was comprised of clinical nurses who worked on a medical-surgical unit in an academic center. Major findings were categorized into 7 main themes with 54 subthemes. Nurses reported personal-level and organizational-level factors that facilitated HIT adaptation. We also generated network graphs to illustrate the occurrence of themes. Thematic interconnectivity differed due to nurses ' concerns and satisfaction at different time points. Equipment and workflow were the most frequent themes across all three rounds. Nurses were the most dissatisfied approximately 9 months after HIT implementation. Eighteen months after HIT implementation , nurses ' perceptions appeared more balanced. It is recommended that organizations invest in equipment ( ie , wireless barcode scanners) , refine policies to reflect nursing practice , and improve systems to focus on patient safety. Future research is necessary to confirm patterns of nurses ' adaptation to HIT in other samples.
