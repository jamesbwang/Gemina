  Despite their placement in Veterans Health Administration centers nationwide , residents ' training and assessment in veteran-centered care is variable and often insufficient. We assessed residents ' ability to recognize and address mental health issues that affect US military veterans. Two unannounced standardized patient ( SP) cases were used to assess internal medicine residents ' veteran-centered care skills from September 2014 to March 2016. Residents were assessed on 7 domains: military history taking , communication skills , assessment skills , mental health screening , triage , and professionalism , using a 36-item checklist. After each encounter , residents completed a questionnaire to assess their ability to recognize knowledge deficits. Residents ' mean scores were compared across training levels , between the 2 cases , and by SP gender. We conducted analysis of variance ( ANOVA) tests to analyze mean performance differences across training levels and descriptive statistics to analyze self-assessment questionnaire results. Ninety-eight residents from 2 internal medicine programs completed the encounter and 53 completed the self-assessment questionnaire. Residents performed best on professionalism ( 0.92 ± 0.20 , percentage of the maximal score) and triage ( 0.87 ± 0.17) , and they scored lowest on posttraumatic stress disorder ( 0.52 ± 0.30) and military sexual trauma ( 0.33 ± 0.39). Few residents reported that they sought out training to enhance their knowledge and skills in the provision of services and support to military and veteran groups beyond their core curriculum. This study suggests that additional education and assessment in veteran-centered care may be needed , particularly in the areas of posttraumatic stress disorder and military sexual trauma.
