  Patients in intensive care unit are susceptible to complications due to different causes ( underlying disease , immobilisation , infection risk...) The current main intervention in order to prevent these complications is respiratory physiotherapy , a common practice for nurses on a daily basis. Therefore , we decided to carry out this bibliographic review to describe the most efficient respiratory physiotherapy methods for the prevention and treatment of lung complications in patients in intensive care , taking into account the differences between intubated and non-intubated patients. The bibliographic narrative review was carried out on literature available in Pubmed , Cinahl and Cochrane Library. The established limits were language , evidence over the last 15 years and age. Techniques involving lung expansion , cough<symptom> , vibration , percussion , postural drainage , incentive inspirometry and oscillatory and non-oscillatory systems are controversial regarding their efficacy as respiratory physiotherapy methods. However , non-invasive mechanical ventilation shows clear benefits. In the case of intubated patients , manual hyperinflation and secretion aspirations are highly efficient methods for the prevention of the potential complications mentioned above. In this case , other RP methods showed no clear efficiency when used individually. Non-invasive mechanical ventilation ( for non-intubated patients) and manual hyperinflation ( for intubated patients) proved to be the respiratory physiotherapy methods with the best results. The other techniques are more controversial and the results are not so clear. In both types of patients this literature review suggests that combined therapy is the most efficient.
