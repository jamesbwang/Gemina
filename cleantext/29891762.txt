  Large amounts of residues are produced in the food industries. The waste shells from cocoa processing are usually burnt for fuel or used as a mulch in gardens to add nutrients to soil and to suppress weeds. The objectives of this work were: ( a) to separate valuable compounds from cocoa shell by applying sustainable green separation process-- subcritical water extraction ( SWE); ( b) identification and quantification of active compounds , sugars and sugar degradation products in obtained extracts using HPLC; ( c) characterization of the antioxidant activity of extracts; ( d) optimization of separation process using response surface methodology ( RSM). Depending on applied extraction conditions , different concentration of theobromine , caffeine , theophylline , epicatechin , catechin , chlorogenic acid and gallic acid were determined in the extracts obtained by subcritical water. Furthermore , mannose , glucose , xylose , arabinose , rhamnose and fucose were detected as well as their important degradation products such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural ( 5-HMF) , furfural , levulinic acid , lactic acid and formic acid.
