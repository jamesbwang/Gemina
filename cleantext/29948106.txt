  None Participants of the prospective Vascular Graft Infection Cohort Study ( VASGRA) were included if they had microbiologically proven AGI. We quantified the metabolic activity in PET/CT by using maximum standardized uptake value ( SUV Sixty-eight participants with AGI contributed to 266 PET/CTs including 36 examinations performed after stop of antimicrobial therapy. Higher C-reactive protein ( CRP) ( adjusted coefficient per log Consecutive PET/CTs could influence the clinical decision-making in patients with AGI in the near future. More studies on the use of PET/CT in case of aortic graft infection may offer the potential for individualized treatment approaches. CLINICALTRIALS. NCT01821664.
