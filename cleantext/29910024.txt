  Many antihyperglycaemic drugs , including insulin , are primarily cleared by the kidneys , restricting treatment options for patients with kidney disease. Dulaglutide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that is not cleared by the kidneys , and confers a lower risk of hypoglycaemia than does insulin. We assessed the efficacy and safety of dulaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease. AWARD-7 was a multicentre , open-label trial done at 99 sites in nine countries. Eligible patients were adults with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease ( stages 3-4) , with an HbA Between Aug 15 , 2012 , and Nov 30 , 2015 , 577 patients were randomly assigned , 193 to dulaglutide 1 · 5 mg , 190 to dulaglutide 0 · 75 mg , and 194 to insulin glargine. The effects on HbA In patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease , once-weekly dulaglutide produced glycaemic control similar to that achieved with insulin glargine , with reduced decline in eGFR. Dulaglutide seems to be safe to use to achieve glycaemic control in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease. Eli Lilly and Company.
