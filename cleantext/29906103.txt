  Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) , a characteristic component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria , can be used as an effective biomarker to detect bacterial contamination. Here , we reported a 293/hTLR4A-MD 2-CD14 cell-based fluorescent biosensor to detect and identify LPS , which is carried out in a 96-well microplate which is nondestructive , user-friendly , and highly efficient. The promoter sequence of the critical signaling pathway gene ZC3H12A ( encoding MCPIP1 protein) and enhanced green fluorescence protein ( EGFP) were combined to construct a recombinant plasmid , which was transferred into 293/hTLR4A-MD 2-CD14 cells through lipid-mediated , DNA-transfection way. LPS was able to bind to TLR4 and coreceptors-induced signaling pathway could result in green fluorescent protein expression. Results show that stable transfected 293/hTLR4A-MD 2-CD14 cells with LPS treatment could be directly and continually observed under a high content screening imaging system. The novel cell-based biosensor detects LPS at low concentration , along with the detection limit of 0.075 Î¼g/mL. The cell-based biosensor was evaluated by differentiating Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and detecting LPS in fruit juices as well. This proposed fluorescent biosensor has potential in sensing LPS optically in foodstuff and biological products , as well as bacteria identification , contributing to the control of foodborne diseases and ensurance of public food safety with its high throughput detection way.
