  Naturally derived prodrugs have a wide range of pharmacological activities , including anticancer , antioxidant , and antiviral effects. However , significant barriers inhibit their use in medicine , e.g. their hydrophobicity. In this comprehensive study , we investigated simple and effective nanoformulations consisting of amine-functionalized and conjugated with folic acid ( FA) mesoporous silica nanoparticles ( MSNs). Two types of MSNs were studied: KCC- 1 , with mean size 324 nm and mean pore diameter 3.4 nm , and MCM- 41 , with mean size 197 and pore diameter 2 nm. Both types of MSNs were loaded with three anticancer prodrugs: curcumin , quercetin , and colchicine. The nanoformulations were tested to target
