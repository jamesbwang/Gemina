  Trimethyl lock ( TML) systems are based on ortho-hydroxydihydrocinnamic acid derivatives displaying increased lactonization reactivity owing to unfavorable steric interactions of three pendant methyl groups , and this leads to the formation of hydrocoumarins. Protection of the phenolic hydroxy function or masking of the reactivity as benzoquinone derivatives prevents lactonization and provides a trigger for controlled release of molecules attached to the carboxylic acid function through amides , esters , or thioesters. Their easy synthesis and possible chemical adaption to several different triggers make TML a highly versatile module for the development of drug-delivery systems , prodrug approaches , cell-imaging tools , molecular tools for supramolecular chemistry , as well as smart stimuliresponsive materials.
