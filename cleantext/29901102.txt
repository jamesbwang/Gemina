  All-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA) has been used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia<disease> ( APL). However , its molecular mechanisms of action are unclear. Ubiquitin-specific protease 48 ( USP48) is a deubiquitinase enzyme that can post-translationally remove ubiquitin molecules from substrates. In the present study , the role of USP48 in ATRA-induced differentiation of APL cells was studied. The expression of USP48 decreased following ATRA treatment. Functionally , overexpression of USP48 using electroporation-mediated delivery inhibited the proliferation of APL cells and promoted ATRA-mediated differentiation. The inverse observations were made upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of USP48. Furthermore , the expression of USP48 was increased in the nucleus upon ATRA exposure for â‰¤ 24 h , suggesting that USP48 was translocated into the nucleus. Interestingly , regulation of p65 , a substrate of USP48 , did not contribute to the downstream mechanism of ATRA-induced differentiation of APL cells. In addition , upstream mechanistic studies demonstrated that the expression of USP48 was regulated by microRNA-301a-3p. In conclusion , the present study highlights the function of USP48 in the ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation of APL cells and provides a theoretical basis for identifying novel targets for differentiation therapy of APL.
