  The effective and straight-forward modification of nanostructured celluloses under aqueous conditions or as & ldquo; never-dried & rdquo; materials is challenging. We report a silanization protocol in water using catalytic amounts of hydrogen chloride and then sodium hydroxide in a two-step protocol. The acidic step hydrolyzes the alkoxysilane to obtain water-soluble silanols and the subsequent addition of catalytic amounts of NaOH induces a covalent reaction between cellulose surficial hydroxyl groups and the respective silanols. The developed protocol enables the incorporation of vinyl , thiol , and azido groups onto cellulose fibers and cellulose nanofibrils. In contrast to conventional methods , no curing or solvent-exchange is necessary , thereby the functionalized celluloses remain never-dried , and no agglomeration or hornification occurs in the process. The successful modification was proven by solid state NMR , ATR-IR , and EDX spectroscopy. In addition , the covalent nature of this bonding was shown by gel permeation chromatography of polyethylene glycol grafted nanofibrils. By varying the amount of silane agents or the reaction time , the silane loading could be tuned up to an amount of 1.2 mmol/g. Multifunctional materials were obtained either by prior carboxymethylation and subsequent silanization; or by simultaneously incorporating both vinyl and azido groups. The protocol reported here is an easy , general , and straight-forward avenue for introduction of anchor groups onto the surface of never-dried celluloses , ready for click chemistry post-modification , to obtain multifunctional cellulose substrates for high-value applications.
