  Most teams in hospital medicine are ad hoc , meaning that the teams vary in participants. Ad hoc teams can be found in academic teaching hospitals where team members change across shifts and rotations. Due to varying team membership , these teams face significant hurdles , because they lack an opportunity to develop a team identity , shared mental models , and trust. This article discusses facilitators and barriers to effective functioning of ad hoc teams. Communication , conflict management , power , and leadership are areas that either serve as facilitators or barriers to positive team function. In addition to discussing these aspects , solutions and recommendations from practice are shared. Solutions include data about successful teams , communication in those teams , and data about how to improve education and team training. These practical applications can be applied in practice to improve team functioning. Finally , we recommend that additional research be conducted in the area of ad hoc teams , because this type of team is a large part of medicine with a gap in evidence.
