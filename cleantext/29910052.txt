  Patients with peripheral artery disease ( PAD) are known to have an increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular events. However , the influence of concomitant PAD on first and subsequent recurrent ischemic events after an acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) remains poorly characterized. We analyzed the combined data set from 4 randomized trials ( PLATO , APPRAISE-2 , TRA-CER , and TRILOGY ACS) in ACS for a follow-up length of 1 year. Using multivariable regression , we examined the association between PAD and major adverse cardiovascular events , a composite of cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , and stroke. Among patients with a nonfatal first event , we evaluated the incidence and type of a second recurrent event. A total of 4,098 of 48,094 ( 8.5 %) post-ACS patients had a history of PAD. The unadjusted frequency of major adverse cardiovascular events was 2-fold higher in patients with PAD ( 14.3 % vs 7.5 %) over a median ( 25th-75th) follow-up of 353 ( 223-365) days with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.63 ( 95 % CI: 1.48-1.78; P < .001). The frequency of recurrent ischemic events among those patients with a first , nonfatal event was higher among those with PAD ( 40.0 % vs 27.7 %). The relative frequency of each event type ( cardiovascular death , noncardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , or stroke) within first and subsequent ischemic events was similar regardless of PAD status at baseline. Patients with PAD have a significantly higher risk of first and recurrent ischemic events in the post-ACS setting. These findings highlight the opportunity for improved treatments in patients with PAD who experience an ACS.
