  Dominant mutations in an antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase-1 ( SOD1) cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) , an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of motor neurons. Oxidative stress has also been linked to many of the neurodegenerative diseases and is likely a central mechanism of motor neuron death in ALS. Astrocytes derived from mutant SOD1
