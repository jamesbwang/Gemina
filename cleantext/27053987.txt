  Myeloid sarcoma<disease> ( MS) , granulocytic sarcoma<disease> or chloroma , is defined as a localized extramedullary mass of blasts of granulocytic lineage with or without maturation , occurring outside the bone<disease> marrow. MS can be diagnosed concurrently with acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome<disease> ( MDS). The authors report a case of sacral MS occurring as a relapse of myeloid leukemia<disease> in a 5-year-old girl who was taken to the emergency department with radiculopathy symptoms.
