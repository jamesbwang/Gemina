  Communication failures can lead to sentinel events in the operating room. Knowledge of basic surgical steps is important for all team members to ensure work flow efficiency. Surgeons and non-surgeons were surveyed to determine perceived and actual quality of communication between team members , using knowledge of surgical steps as a marker of communication quality. Participants agreed that communication was important , but non-surgeons were unable to name the four key steps of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( p = 5.0E-07) , indicating poor communication between surgeons and non-surgeons.
