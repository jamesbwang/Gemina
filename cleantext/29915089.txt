  The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) forms a contiguous network of tubules and sheets that is predominantly associated with the cell cortex in yeast. Upon treatment with rapamycin , the ER undergoes degradation by selective autophagy. This process , termed ER-phagy , requires Atg40 , a selective autophagy receptor that localizes to the cortical ER. Here we report that ER-phagy also requires Lnp1 , an ER membrane protein that normally resides at the three-way junctions of the ER network , where it serves to stabilize the network as it is continually remodeled. Rapamycin treatment increases the expression of Atg40 , driving ER domains marked by Atg40 puncta to associate with Atg11 , a scaffold protein needed to form autophagosomes. Although Atg40 largely localizes to the cortical ER , the autophagy machinery resides in the cell interior. The localization of Atg40 to sites of autophagosome formation is blocked in an
