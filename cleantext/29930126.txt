  The dielectric constant ε of interfacial water has been predicted to be smaller than that of bulk water ( ε ≈ 80) because the rotational freedom of water dipoles is expected to decrease near surfaces , yet experimental evidence is lacking. We report local capacitance measurements for water confined between two atomically flat walls separated by various distances down to 1 nanometer. Our experiments reveal the presence of an interfacial layer with vanishingly small polarization such that its out-of-plane ε is only ~ 2. The electrically dead layer is found to be two to three molecules thick. These results provide much-needed feedback for theories describing water-mediated surface interactions and the behavior of interfacial water , and show a way to investigate the dielectric properties of other fluids and solids under extreme confinement.
