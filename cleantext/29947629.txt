  The rapid emergence of drug-resistant variants is one of the most common causes of highly active antiretroviral therapeutic ( HAART) failure in patients infected with HIV-1. Compared with the existing HAART , the recently developed pyrrolyl diketo acid scaffold targeting both HIV-1 integrase ( IN) and reverse transcriptase-associated ribonuclease H ( RNase H) is an efficient approach to counteract the failure of anti-HIV treatment due to drug resistance. However , the binding mode and potential resistance profile of these inhibitors with important mechanistic principles remain poorly understood. To address this issue , an integrated computational method was employed to investigate the binding mode of inhibitor JMC6F with HIV-1 IN and RNase H. By using per-residue binding free energy decomposition analysis , the following residues: Asp64 , Thr66 , Leu68 , Asp116 , Tyr143 , Gln148 and Glu152 in IN , Asp443 , Glu478 , Trp536 , Lys541 and Asp549 in RNase H were identified as key residues for JMC6F binding. And then computational alanine scanning was carried to further verify the key residues. Moreover , the resistance profile of the currently known major mutations in HIV-1 IN and 2 mutations in RNase H against JMC6F was predicted by in silico mutagenesis studies. The results demonstrated that only three mutations in HIV-1 IN ( Y143C , Q148R and N155H) and two mutations in HIV-1 RNase H ( Y501R and Y501W) resulted in a reduction of JMC6F potency , thus indicating their potential role in providing resistance to JMC6F. These data provided important insights into the binding mode and resistance profile of the inhibitors with a pyrrolyl diketo acid scaffold in HIV-1 IN and RNase H , which would be helpful for the development of more effective dual HIV-1 IN and RNase H inhibitors.
