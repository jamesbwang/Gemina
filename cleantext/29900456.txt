  A carbonic anhydrase inspired material was developed by incorporating Zn ( ii) ion exchanged zeolite Î² into poly ( N-vinylimidazole) solution. The hydrophobic zeolite channels were designed to imitate the function of the hydrophobic pocket in carbonic anhydrase. The composite membrane prepared by casting the material on a polysulfone ultrafiltration membrane showed a high CO2 permeance of 4620 GPU with a high CO2/N2 selectivity of 224.
