  DNA fingerprinting is a major tool in identifying individuals and in evidence matching. However , this technique can be difficult to reproduce in practical classes. Here , we report on distinct PCR profiles obtained when amplifying saliva DNA of a score of distinct individuals with Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA ( RAPD)- PCR primer BOXA1R. The RAPD-PCR method is simple and efficient for discrimination between bacterial strains and is used in this instance to obtain personalized fingerprints of each individual 's oral microbiota. We present real results with undergraduate students confirming that this procedure is easily feasible in practical classes. Based on the results presented , we suggest a laboratory activity for undergraduate Molecular Biology or Microbiology students.
