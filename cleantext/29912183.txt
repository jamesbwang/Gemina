  After animals are euthanized , their tissues begin to die. Turtles offer an advantage because of a longer survival time of their tissues , especially when compared to warm-blooded vertebrates. Because of this , in vitro experiments in turtles can be performed for extended periods of time to investigate the neural signals and control of their target actions. Using an isolated head preparation , we measured the kinematics of eye movements<symptom> in turtles , and their modulation by electrical signals carried by cranial nerves. After the brain was removed from the skull , leaving the cranial nerves intact , the dissected head was placed in a gimbal to calibrate eye movements<symptom>. Glass electrodes were attached to cranial nerves ( oculomotor , trochlear , and abducens) and stimulated with currents to evoke eye movements<symptom>. We monitored eye movements<symptom> with an infrared video tracking system and quantified rotations of the eyes. Current pulses with a range of amplitudes , frequencies , and train durations were used to observe effects on responses. Because the preparation is separated from the brain , the efferent pathway going to muscle targets can be examined in isolation to investigate neural signaling in the absence of centrally processed sensory information.
