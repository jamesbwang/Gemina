  Although intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH) is more common among African-Americans , data on the burden of cerebral microbleeds ( CMBs) among different races is limited. The purpose of this study is to compare the number , associated factors , and topography of CMBs between African-American and Caucasian populations in the Mid-South United States. Using natural language processing , we extracted all brain MRIs performed during a 2-year period ( 2012-2013) when the report indicated the presence of CMB. All the extracted MRI studies were evaluated for number and location of CMBs , prior stroke , and deep white matter lesion<symptom>. Negative binomial regression was used to model for the overdispersed count data. A total 167 patients ( mean age was 63 ± 15 years , 49 % men , 77 % African-American , median CMB count: 8) with 1 or more CMBs on their brain MRI were included in this study. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of CMB locations ( P = .086) , but there was a significant difference between African-American and Caucasian patients in terms of number of CMBs ( 16.5 ± 18 versus 6.5 ± 5.5 , P < .001). The prevalence of multiple CMBs ( CMBs ≥ 5) was similar among African-Americans and Caucasians ( 72 % versus 55 % , P = .062). After adjusting for potential confounders , the African-American race was not independently associated with a higher CMB burden ( P = .073). African-American race was not independently associated with a higher rate of CMB burden when compared to Caucasians after adjusting for potential confounders. We also did not observe a significant racial difference regarding the location and prevalence of multiple CMBs ( CMBs ≥ 5).
