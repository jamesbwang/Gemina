  The objective of the study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature so as to evaluate and summarize the diagnostic and prognostic potential of GCF. Included studies were systematically analyzed based on PRISMA ( Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses) and studies were identified based on the-PICO ( Glossary of evidence based terms 2007): 1) Patients with chronic periodontitis<disease> .2) Intervention- NSPT ( Non-SurgicalPeriodontal therapy); NSPT + Chemotherapeutics .3) Comparison between treated v/s non treated sites .4) Outcomes measured: Analysis of variation in constituents of GCF. Electronic database search of Pubmed , Medline , Google Scholar and Scopus was performed using ( MeSH) terms- Gingival Crevicular fluid and Cytokines , MMP 's , NE , PGE-2 , A2M , B2M , ALP , AST , Osteocalcin and Calprotectin. Articles published between year 2000-2016 were reviewed and were included based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on this systematic review of literature , it can be concluded that analysis of constituents of GCF can be used as an effective and efficient diagnostic tool of periodontal<disease> diseases<disease>. These biomarkers in turn with their prognostic significance could act as a valuable tool in the combat of
