  Recently , heme proteins have been discovered and engineered by directed evolution to catalyze chemical transformations that are biochemically unprecedented. Many of these nonnatural enzyme-catalyzed reactions are assumed to proceed through a catalytic iron porphyrin carbene ( IPC) intermediate , although this intermediate has never been observed in a protein. Using crystallographic , spectroscopic , and computational methods , we have captured and studied a catalytic IPC intermediate in the active site of an enzyme derived from thermostable
