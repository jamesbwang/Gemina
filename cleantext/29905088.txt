  Ohmic heating ( OH) is an alternative food processing technology for effectively inactivating microorganisms that depends on the heat that has been generated when electrical current passes directly through food material. The advantages of OH for microbial inactivation include shorter heating time , more uniform heat distribution inside food , reduced nutrition losses , and higher energy efficiency. This review presents some published information regarding the inactivation of microorganisms by OH , including the major factors that influence the inactivation effectiveness of OH , the inactivation of vegetative cells and spores in foods by OH , the inactivation mechanisms of OH , and the challenges and prospects of OH for food processing. This information will improve the understanding of OH for inactivation of microorganisms and promote the application of OH in the food industry.
