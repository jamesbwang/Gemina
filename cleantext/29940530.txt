  In this study , a series of layered double hydroxide ( ZxAy LDH) material was synthesized with different molar ratios and calcination temperatures to remove phosphate and sulfate ions from synthetic solution. ZxAy LDH was characterized by XRD , FTIR , BET and SEM analysis. The highest removal was obtained by Z3A200 LDH that is LDH with a Zn-Al molar ratio of 3 and calcined at 200 Â°C. The leaching of Zn and Al was more under highly acidic pH compared to pH 5 and 8. Adsorption isotherms data had a good fit with Langmuir model and maximum adsorption under optimum conditions led to 2.6-2.72 and 1.02-1.31 mmol/g for phosphate and sulfate , respectively. Kinetic studies have been performed by applying reaction based models and diffusion-based models , which indicated the chemisorption interaction for Z3A200 by a controlling step of the macro-pore and micro-pore diffusion for phosphate and sulfate adsorption process onto Z3A200 , respectively. Thermodynamic studies showed that adsorption process onto Z3A200 was endothermic and spontaneous. Thus , phosphate and sulfate adsorption by using optimized Zn-Al LDH appears to be a promising adsorbent for their removal.
