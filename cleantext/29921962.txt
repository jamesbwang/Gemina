  Peritoneal dialysis ( PD) patients with sarcopenia have increased risk of mortality. There is consensus that sarcopenia should combine assessments of muscle function and mass. We wished to determine the effect of using different operational definitions in PD patients. Hand grip strength ( HGS) and segmental bioimpedance derived appendicular lean mass ( ALM) were measured and the prevalence of sarcopenia determined using the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Sarcopenia Project ( FNIH) , European Working Group on Sarcopenia Older Persons ( EWGSOP) , and Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia ( AWGS) definitions. We studied 155 PD patients , 95 men ( 61.3 %) , mean age 63.0 ± 14.9 years , 37.4 % diabetic , treated by PD 9 ( 3-20) months with a HGS of 22.5 ( 15.5-30.2) kg , weight 73.6 ± 16.6 kg , % body fat 31.4 ± 4.2 , and ALM index 7.52 ± 1.40 kg/m We report a much lower prevalence of sarcopenia compared to studies in haemodialysis patients. Although there may be an element of patient selection bias , PD patients are not subject to changes in hydration and electrolytes with haemodialysis , which can affect HGS and muscle mass measurements. Using HGS and segmental bioimpedance we found similar prevalence of sarcopenia using EWGSOP , FNIH , AWGS definitions.
