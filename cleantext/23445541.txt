  It is known that some groups of immigrants can have low health literacy and it may affect their health. Although the number of North Korean defectors in the Republic of Korea has increased , little is known about their health literacy and health behavior. Adult North Korean defectors ( n = 399) in this study were surveyed on health literacy , using the Korean Health Literacy Scale , and on the use of preventive services. Those with better health literacy scores were more likely to have vaccination than the lower scoring group ( adjusted OR = 2.44; 95 % CI , 1.19-5.00). However , undergoing medical check-up may not be associated with health literacy. In subgroup analysis , among defectors who lived alone ( P = 0.032) or who had longer time in other countries before entering ( P = 0.007) , the vaccination coverage was associated with their health literacy scores. This study provides evidence for an association between health literacy and influenza<disease> vaccination coverage among North Korean defectors even though they may have fewer language barriers than other immigrants. Further research is needed to develop interventions for improving health literacy and their preventive health behavior.
