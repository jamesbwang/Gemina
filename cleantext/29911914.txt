  Psychological stress , which exerts detrimental effects on human reproduction , may compromise the meiotic competence of oocytes. Meiotic resumption , germinal vesicle breakdown ( GVBD) , is the first milestone to confer meiotic competence to oocytes. In the practice of assisted reproductive technology ( ART) , the timing for GVBD is associated with the rates of cleavage and blastocyst formation. However , whether chronic stress compromises oocyte competence by influencing GVBD and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In the present study , a chronic restraint stress ( CRS) mouse model was used to investigate the effects of stress on oocyte meiotic resumption , as well as the mechanisms. Following a 4-week chronic restraint stress in female mice , the percentage of abnormal bipolar spindles increased and indicated compromised oocyte competence in the CRS group. Furthermore , we identified a decreased percentage of GVBD and prolonged time of GVBD in the CRS mouse oocytes compared with the control group. CRS simultaneously reduced the expression of cyclin B1 ( CCNB1) , which represents a regulatory subunit of M-phase/mature promoting factors ( MPF). However , MG132 , an inhibitor of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome ( APC/C) , could rescue the prolonged time of GVBD and increase the expression level of CCNB1 of oocytes from the CRS mice. Collectively , our results demonstrated that stress disturbed meiotic resumption through APC/C-mediated CCNB1 degradation , thus providing a novel understanding for stress-related oocyte quality decline; moreover , it may provide a non-invasive approach to select high-quality gametes and novel targets for molecular therapy to treat stress-related female
