  This study examined the moderating role of social support in the acculturation-obesity/central obesity relationship in Mexican American ( MA) men and women. Data from NHANES 1999-2008 were used. Acculturation derived from language use , country of birth and length of residence in the U.S. Social support assessed emotional and financial support. BMI ( ≥ 30) and waist circumference ( ≥ 88 cm for women; ≥ 102 cm for men) measured obesity and central obesity , respectively. Weighted multivariate logistic regression models were used to describe associations. Compared to less acculturation , more acculturation was associated with higher odds of obesity ( ORs 2.48; 95 % CI 1.06-5.83) and central obesity ( 2.90; 1.39-6.08) among MA men with low/no social support , but not among MA men reporting high social support. The modifying effects was not observed among women. Higher amounts of social support appeared to attenuate the risk of obesity/central obesity associated with acculturation. Interventions enhancing social support maybe effective among acculturated MAs , particularly among men.
