  The transition to the chaos of the air flow between two vertical plates maintained at different temperatures is studied in the Boussinesq approximation. After the first bifurcation at critical Rayleigh number Ra _ ( c) , the flow consists of two-dimensional ( 2D) corotating rolls. The stability of the 2D rolls is examined , confronting linear predictions with nonlinear integration. In all cases the 2D rolls are destabilized in the spanwise direction. Efficient linear stability analysis based on an Arnoldi method shows competition between two eigenmodes , corresponding to different spanwise wavelengths and different types of roll distortion. Nonlinear integration shows that the lower-wave-number mode is always dominant. A partial route to chaos is established through the nonlinear simulations. The flow becomes temporally chaotic for Ra = 1.05 Ra _ ( c) , but remains characterized by the spatial patterns identified by linear stability analysis. This highlights the complementary role of linear stability analysis and nonlinear simulation.
