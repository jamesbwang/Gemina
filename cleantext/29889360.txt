  Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism ( FOCM) comprises a network of interconnected folate-dependent metabolic pathways responsible for serine and glycine interconversion , de novo purine synthesis , de novo thymidylate synthesis and homocysteine remethylation to methionine. These pathways are compartmentalized in the cytosol , nucleus and mitochondria. Individual enzymes within the FOCM network compete for folate cofactors because intracellular folate concentrations are limiting. Although there are feedback mechanisms that regulate the partitioning of folate cofactors among the folate-dependent pathways , less recognized is the impact of cell cycle regulation on FOCM. This review summarizes the evidence for temporal regulation of expression , activity and cellular localization of enzymes and pathways in the FOCM network in mammalian cells through the cell cycle.
