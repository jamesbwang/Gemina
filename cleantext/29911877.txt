  Research has supported the applied use of Direct Behavior Rating Single-Item Scale ( DBR-SIS) targets of `` academic engagement '' and `` disruptive behavior '' for a range of purposes , including universal screening and progress monitoring. Though useful in evaluating social behavior and externalizing problems , these targets have limited utility in evaluating emotional behavior and internalizing problems. Thus , the primary purpose of this study was to support the initial development and validation of a novel DBR-SIS target of `` unhappy , '' which was intended to tap into the specific construct of depression<symptom> A particular focus of this study was on the novel target 's utility within universal screening. A secondary purpose was to further validate the aforementioned existing DBR-SIS targets. Within this study , 87 teachers rated 1,227 students across two measures ( i.e. , DBR-SIS and the Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptation-Checklist ( TOCA-C)) and time points ( i.e. , fall and spring). Correlational analyses supported the test-retest reliability of each DBR-SIS target , as well as its convergent and discriminant validity across concurrent and predictive comparisons. Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analyses further supported ( a) the overall diagnostic accuracy of each target ( as indicated by the area under the curve ( AUC) statistic) , as well as ( b) the selection of cut scores found to accurately differentiate at-risk and not at-risk students ( as indicated by conditional probability statistics). A broader review of findings suggested that across the majority of analyses , the existing DBR-SIS targets outperformed the novel `` unhappy '' target. ( PsycINFO Database Record
