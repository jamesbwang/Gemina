  In seeking to support diversity , one challenge lies in adequately supporting and assessing science cognitions in a writing-intensive Biochemistry laboratory course when highly engaged Asian English language learners ( Asian ELLs) struggle to communicate and make novice errors in English. Because they may understand advanced science concepts , but are not being adequately assessed for their deeper scientific understanding , we sought and examined interventions. We hypothesized that inquiry strategies , scaffolded learning through peer evaluation , and individualized tools that build writing communication skills would increase confidence. To assess scientific thinking , Linguistic Inquiry Word Count ( LIWC) software measured underlying analytic and cognitive features of writing despite grammatical errors. To determine whether interventions improved student experience or learning outcomes , we investigated a cross-sectional sample of cases within experimental groups (
