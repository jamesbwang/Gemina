  The potential benefit of early coronary angiography in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA) patients without ST elevation on ECG is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between early coronary angiography and survival in these patients. Nationwide observational study between 2008 and 2013. Included were patients admitted to hospital after witnessed OHCA , with shockable rhythm , age 18 to 80 years and unconscious. Patients with ST-elevation on ECG were excluded. Patients that underwent early CAG ( within 24 hours) were compared with no early CAG ( later during the hospital stay or not at all). Outcomes were survival at 30 days , 1 year , and 3 years. Multivariate analysis included pre-hospital factors , comorbidity and ECG-findings. In total , 799 OHCA patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria , of which 275 ( 34 %) received early CAG versus 524 ( 66 %) with no early CAG. In the early CAG group , the proportion of patients with an occluded coronary artery was 27 % and 70 % had at least one significant coronary stenosis ( defined as narrowing of coronary lumen diameter of â‰¥ 50 %). The 30-day survival rate was 65 % in early CAG group versus 52 % with no early CAG ( P < .001). The adjusted OR was 1.42 ( 95 % CI 1.00-2.02). The one-year survival rate was 62 % in the early CAG group versus 48 % in the no early CAG group with the adjusted hazard ratio of 1.35 ( 95 % CI 1.04-1.77). In this population of bystander-witnessed cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with shockable rhythm and ECG without ST elevation , early coronary angiography may be associated with improved short and long term survival.
