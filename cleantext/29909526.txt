  In the soybean cultivar Suweon 97 , BCMV-resistance gene was fine-mapped to a 58.1-kb region co-localizing with the Soybean mosaic virus ( SMV)- resistance gene , Rsv1-h raising a possibility that the same gene is utilized against both viral pathogens. Certain soybean cultivars exhibit resistance against soybean mosaic virus ( SMV) or bean common mosaic virus ( BCMV). Although several SMV-resistance loci have been reported , the understanding of the mechanism underlying BCMV resistance in soybean is limited. Here , by crossing a resistant cultivar Suweon 97 with a susceptible cultivar Williams 82 and inoculating 220 F
