  To ascertain the prognostic role of the T4 and N2 category in stage III pancreatic cancer according to the 8 Patients were collected from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results ( SEER) database ( 2004-2013) and were divided into three groups: T ( 1-3) N2 , T4N ( 0-1) , and T4N2. Overall survival ( OS) and disease-specific survival ( DSS) of patients were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. For the first time , we found a significant difference in OS and DSS between T ( 1-3) N2/T4N ( 0-1) and T4N2 but not between T ( 1-3) N2 and T4N ( 0-1). A higher grading correlated with a worse prognosis in the T ( 1-3) N2 and T4N2 groups. Patients with stage T4N2 had a worse prognosis than those with stage T ( 1-3) N2/T4N ( 0-1) in the 8
