  An efficient and expedient fluoride-mediated α-selective 1,6-conjugate addition of allenic esters to para-quinone methides has been developed. The reaction exhibited an excellent substrate scope , and a wide range of α-diarylmethylated allenic esters were obtained in good to excellent yields. It was further shown that the strategy could be extended to isatin-derived quinone methides yielding allenic esters containing 3,3-disubstituted oxindoles. The tert-butyl ester of α-diarylmethylated allenoate was effectively converted into γ-butenolide through a Au/Ag catalyzed cyclization strategy.
