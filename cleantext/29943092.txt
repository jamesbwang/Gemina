  Dl-3-n-Butylphthalide ( NBP) , a small molecule compound extracted from the seeds of Apium graveolens , possesses a large range of biological effects. Here , we attempted to explore the therapeutic effects of NBP on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced major depressive disorder ( MDD) and gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms of the antidepressant effects of NBP. We evaluated the effect of NBP against LPS-induced behavioral changes in rats. We also examined the inflammation<symptom> , oxidative stress , and apoptosis markers and analyzed the Nrf2 and NF-κB pathways in the hippocampus of rats following repeated peripheral immune challenge by LPS for 2 weeks ( 500 μg/kg every other day). Our results indicated that repeated LPS administration induced the rats to a depressive-like state and activated inflammatory response , oxidative stress , and apoptosis reactions in the hippocampus. NBP treatment attenuated the LPS-induced abnormal<symptom> behavior<symptom> and ameliorated pathogenic processes in rats with MDD. NBP reduced the inflammatory response with inhibited expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and IL-6 and downregulated the NF-κB signal pathway. Concurrent with the anti-inflammation action , NBP reduced LPS-induced oxidative reactions in the hippocampus and enhanced Nrf2-targeted signals , as evidenced by increased transcription of antioxidant enzymes and decreased malondialdehyde ( MDA) production. In addition , NBP inhibited LPS-induced neuronal apoptosis in the rat brain , as evidenced by decreased apoptosis marker Caspase-3 production and TUNEL assay. These results provide more insight into pathogenesis of MDD and firstly demonstrated the potential antidepressant actions of NBP.
