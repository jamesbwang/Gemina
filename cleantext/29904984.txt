  The electronic functionalities of metal oxides comprise conductors , semiconductors , and insulators. Metal oxides have attracted great interest for construction of large-area electronics , particularly thin-film transistors ( TFTs) , for their high optical transparency , excellent chemical and thermal stability , and mechanical tolerance. High-permittivity ( Îº) oxide dielectrics are a key component for achieving low-voltage and high-performance TFTs. With the expanding integration of complementary metal oxide semiconductor transistors , the replacement of SiO
