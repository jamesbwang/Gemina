  To the best of our knowledge , only two studies analyzed the relationship between HRV and carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA) in colon cancer patients. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in the autonomic activity of colon cancer patients using heart rate variability ( HRV) and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> variability ( BPV) measures , and to verify if HRV and BPV parameters correlate with hemodynamic indices in this group (...) and the plasma levels of CEA. Presence of colon cancer is associated with changes in autonomic activity , namely parasympathetic-sympathetic imbalance in form of sympathetic overdrive. Cancer-related autonomic dysfunction may contribute to impairment of gastrointestinal motility.
