  Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD) show deficient planning capacity in the Tower of London ( TOL) problem solving task. Preliminary evidence for similar deficits in unaffected first-degree relatives suggests that impaired planning may constitute an endophenotype of OCD. However , results on this issue are inconsistent , possibly owing to small sample sizes and variability in problem structure across TOL tasks. Here , we adopted a computerized version of the TOL task featuring a 2 × 2 factorial design ( high/low search depth × full/partial tower goal state) and examined a well-characterized sample of n = 72 OCD patients , n = 76 unaffected first-degree relatives and n = 102 healthy comparison subjects. Both OCD patients and relatives exhibited significantly less accurate problem solving than controls. Search depth , goal hierarchy , or the number of minimum moves did not moderate these group differences. Medication , OCD symptoms , and depressive comorbidity did not affect TOL performance in patients , suggesting a state-independent effect. In conclusion , we found that OCD patients as well as unaffected first-degree relatives show deficient TOL performance across a range of task conditions , strongly supporting the role of impaired planning as an endophenotype of OCD , and contributing to the growing evidence for fronto-striatal dysfunctions in OCD.
