  Pre-operative assessment is vital to determine patient-specific risks and minimize them in order to optimize surgical outcomes. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ( ACSNSQIP) Surgical Risk Calculator is the most comprehensive surgical risk assessment tool available. We performed this study to determine the validity of ACSNSQIP calculator when used to predict surgical complications in a cohort of patients with head and neck cancer treated in an Indian tertiary care center. Retrospective data was collected for 150 patients with head and neck cancer who were operated in the Department of Head and Neck Oncology , Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences , Kochi , in the year 2016. The predicted outcome data was compared with actual documented outcome data for the variables mentioned. Brier 's score was used to estimate the predictive value of the risk assessment generated.
