  The many facets of the oxytocin ( OXT) system of the brain and periphery elicited nearly 25,000 publications since 1930 ( see FIGURE 1 , as listed in PubMed) , which revealed central roles for OXT and its receptor ( OXTR) in reproduction , and social and emotional behaviors in animal and human studies focusing on mental and physical health and disease. In this review , we discuss the mechanisms of OXT expression and release , expression and binding of the OXTR in brain and periphery , OXTR-coupled signaling cascades , and their involvement in behavioral outcomes to assemble a comprehensive picture of the central and peripheral OXT system. Traditionally known for its role in milk let-down and uterine contraction during labor , OXT also has implications in physiological , and also behavioral , aspects of reproduction , such as sexual and maternal behaviors and pair bonding , but also anxiety<symptom> , trust , sociability , food intake , or even drug abuse. The many facets of OXT are , on a molecular basis , brought about by a single receptor. The OXTR , a 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor capable of binding to either GÎ±
