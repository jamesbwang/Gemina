  A paradigm shift in our understanding of shrimp<disease> immunity offers the potential to develop novel disease-control strategies. We summarize cutting-edge findings on the phenomenon of trained immunity in shrimps<disease> and discuss how it may contribute to new avenues for controlling disease in these aquaculturally important animals.
