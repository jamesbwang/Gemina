  The aim of this study was to correlate the clinical staging ( clinical severity) with the histopathological staging ( histopathological changes) of oral submucous fibrosis<disease> ( OSF) patients , which would further assist the clinicians to formulate a definite treatment plan. The study group consisted of 50 subjects who were clinically and histologically diagnosed as OSF. Detailed information was gathered in a pretested proforma with emphasis on the various addictions. The clinical findings were noted; punch biopsy was performed followed by histological examination. Clinical and histological staging were divided into four stages , as Stages I-IV according to Khanna and Andrade classification. The 50 subjects were in the age range of 18-70 years , of which 20 patients were in clinical Group III , 15 were in histopathological stage III , 2 , 1 , and 2 in Stage II , Stage I , and Stage IV , respectively , out of 5 patients in clinical Group IV , 4 were in histopathological staging IV and 1 was in Stage III , out of 5 patients in clinical Group I , 3 and 2 were in histologic Stages II and I , respectively. Statistical analysis with Chi-square test showed high significance with P < 0.001. The correlation of clinical and histopathological staging was found to be highly significant , thus suggesting that the subject with clinically advanced OSF had extensive fibrosis<disease> histologically.
