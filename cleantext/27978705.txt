  A new Passerini-type reaction in which hexafluoroisopropanol functions as the acid component is reported. The reaction tolerates a broad range of isocyanides and aldehydes , and the formed imidates can be reduced toward Î²-amino alcohols under mild and metal-free conditions. In addition , the imidate products were shown to undergo an unprecedented retro-Passerini-type reaction under microwave conditions , providing valuable mechanistic information about the Passerini reaction and its variations.
