  So far , the relationship between wind and athletics performance has been studied mainly for 100 m sprint , based on simulation of biomechanical models , requiring several assumptions. In this study , this relationship is quantified empirically for all five horizontal jump and sprint events where wind is measured , with freely available competition results. After systematic scraping several elite and sub-elite results sites , the obtained results ( n = 150,169) were filtered and matched to athletes. A quadratic mixed effects model with athlete and season as random effects was applied to express the influence of wind velocity on performance in each event. Whether this effect differs with performance level was investigated by applying the model on subgroups based on performance level. In the fitted quadratic model , the linear coefficients were significant ( p < .001) for all events; the quadratic coefficients were significant for all events ( p < .001) except long jump ( p = .138).
