  This work describes the production of lipases from endophytic fungi<pathogen> Vermisporium-like , Emericella nidulans<pathogen> , Dichotomophtora portulacae<pathogen> and D. boerhaaviae and the biological activity against the dermatophyte fungi<pathogen> Malassezia<pathogen> sp and Microsporum<pathogen> canis<pathogen> and the parasite Leishmania<pathogen> amazonensis. All fungal enzymes extract showed lipolysis action in the media that contains long carbon chain lipids. The proteomic analysis of lipases exhibits several molecules mostly ranging in size from 220 to 20 kDa , with clear differences in protein profile 's yield. All fungal enzymes were competent to eliminate promastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis at 5 mg.mL-1. The antileishmanial activity of lipases from Vermisporium-like , E. nidulans<pathogen> , D.<pathogen> portulacae<pathogen> and D. boerhaaviae in amastigote forms , promoted the reduction in viability of 78.88 , 39.65 , 63.17 and 98.13 % , with selectivity index of 19.56 , 30.68 , 18.09 and 20.99. In relation to antifungal activity , Dichothomophtora enzymes demonstrate best action with MFC of 14.65 Î¼g.mL-1 against Malassezia<pathogen> sp and Microsporum<pathogen> canis<pathogen> , respectively. These results allow us to infer that lipases from entophytic fungi<pathogen> displays activity against dermatophyte fungi<pathogen> ( Malassezia<pathogen> sp. and Microsporum<pathogen> canis<pathogen> as well as Leishmania.
