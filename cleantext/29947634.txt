  The trans-chelating bis ( oxazoline) ligand ( R , R) -4,6-dibenzofurandiyl-2,2 '- bis ( 4-phenyloxazoline) ( ( R , R)- DBFOX/Ph) coordinates metal ions to give C2-symmetric complexes which effectively catalyze a variety of asymmetric reactions. ( R , R)- DBFOX/Ph · Ni ( ClO4) 2 · 3H2O , whose crystal structure is octahedral with three aqua ligands , can be stored under air for several months without loss of catalytic activity and promotes highly enantioselective reactions even in the presence of excess amounts of water , alcohols , amines , and acids. The complex shows remarkable chiral amplification in asymmetric Diels-Alder ( DA) reactions. This review focuses on enantioselective reactions catalyzed by ( R , R)- DBFOX/Ph · metal complexes.
