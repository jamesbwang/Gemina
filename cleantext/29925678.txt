  The recognition of nonself dsRNA by retinoic acid-inducible gene-I ( RIG-I) leads to the engagement of RIG-I-like receptor signaling. In addition , nonself dsRNA triggers a robust latent RNase ( RNase L) activation and leads to the degradation of ribosomal structures and cell death. In contrast , nonself ssRNA is known to be recognized by TLR 7/8 in immune cells such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells , but little is known regarding the involvement of nonself ssRNA in antiviral signaling in nonimmune cells , including epithelial cells. Moreover , the fate of intracellular nonself ssRNA remains unknown. To address this issue , we developed a quantitative RT-PCR-based approach that monitors the kinetics of nonself ssRNA cleavage following the transfection of HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells , using model nonself ssRNA. We discovered that the degradation of ssRNA is independent of RIG-I and type I IFN signaling because ssRNA did not trigger RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling. We also found that the kinetics of self ( 5 '- capped) and nonself ssRNA decay were unaltered , suggesting that nonself ssRNA is not recognized by nonimmune cells. We further demonstrated that the cleavage of nonself ssRNA is accelerated when nonself dsRNA is also introduced into cells. In addition , the cleavage of nonself ssRNA is completely abolished by knockdown of RNase L. Overall , our data demonstrate the important role of dsRNA-RNase L in nonself ssRNA degradation and may partly explain the positive regulation of the antiviral responses in nonimmune cells.
