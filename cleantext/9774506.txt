  The early evolution of mammals is associated with the linked evolutionary origin of diphyodont tooth replacement , rapid juvenile growth and determinate adult growth. However , specific relationships among these characters during non-mammalian cynodont evolution require further exploration. Here , polarized light microscopy revealed incremental lines , resembling daily laminations of extant mammals , in histological sections of enamel in eight non-mammalian cynodont species. In the more basal non-probainognathian group , enamel extends extremely rapidly from cusp to cervix. By contrast , the enamel of mammaliamorphs is gradually accreted , with slow rates of crown extension , more typical of the majority of non-hypsodont crown mammals. These results are consistent with the reduction in dental replacement rate across the non-mammalian cynodont lineage , with greater rates of crown extension required in most non-probainognathians , and slower crown extension rates permitted in mammaliamorphs , which have reduced patterns of dental replacement in comparison with many non-probainognathians. The evolution of mammal-like growth patterns , with faster juvenile growth and more abruptly terminating adult growth , is linked with this reduction in dental replacement rates and may provide an additional explanation for the observed pattern in enamel growth rates. It is possible that the reduction in enamel extension rates in mammaliamorphs reflects an underlying reduction in skeletal growth rates at the time of postcanine formation , due to a more abruptly terminating pattern of adult growth in these more mammal-like , crownward species.
