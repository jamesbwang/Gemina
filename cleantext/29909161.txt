  When analyzing the microbiota-host crosstalk , we have to consider three participants in this dialogue: the gut microbiota , the intestinal barrier and bacterial translocation. Experimental data demonstrate that host microbiota crosstalk plays a causal on the regulation of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , glucose metabolism and the development of atherosclerosis. Host microbiota crosstalk is associated in humans with main cardiovascular risk factors notably hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Host microbiota crosstalk is associated in humans with the onset of cardiovascular diseases. The Mediterranean diet has proven as proven to be an effective strategy in improving cardiovascular prognosis and in changing gut microbiota.
