  Cardiac stress testing improves detection and risk assessment of heart disease. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) is the clinical gold-standard for assessing cardiac morphology and function at rest; however , exercise MRI has not been widely adapted for cardiac assessment due to imaging and device limitations. Commercially available MR ergometers , together with improved imaging sequences , have overcome many previous limitations , making cardiac stress MRI more feasible. Here , we aimed to demonstrate clinical feasibility , and establish the normative , healthy response to supine exercise MRI. Eight young , healthy subjects , underwent rest and exercise cinematic imaging to measure left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. To establish the normative , healthy response to exercise MRI we performed a comprehensive literature review and meta-analysis of existing exercise cardiac MRI studies. Results were pooled using a random effects model to define the left ventricular ejection fraction , end-diastolic , end-systolic , and stroke volume responses. Our proof-of-concept data showed a marked increase in cardiac index with exercise , secondary to an increase in both heart rate and stroke volume. The change in stroke volume was driven by a reduction in end-systolic volume , with no change in end-diastolic volume. These findings were entirely consistent with 17 previous exercise MRI studies ( 226 individual records) , despite differences in imaging approach , ergometer , or exercise type. Taken together , the data herein demonstrate that exercise cardiac MRI is clinically feasible , using commercially available exercise equipment and vendor-provided product sequences , and establish the normative , healthy response to exercise MRI.
