  Amantadine blocks N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA) receptors and has dopaminergic and noradrenergic action , a neurochemical profile that suggests its potential as an antidepressant drug. We conducted a systematic review of preclinical and clinical studies addressing the effects of amantadine in animal models of depression<symptom> and in patients with depression<symptom> PubMed , Science Direct , and Web of Science were searched up to September 1 , 2017 to identify clinical and preclinical studies. The following search terms were used: `` amantadine AND depress * ''; `` amantadine AND mood ''; `` amantadine AND animal models AND antidepres * ''; and `` amantadine AND ( forced swim , learned helplessness , reserpine , chronic mild stress , anhedonia , sucrose preference). '' Amantadine had antidepressant-like effects in animal models and appeared to potentiate the antidepressant effects of other antidepressants. These preclinical findings have received some support from the results of small open-label clinical trials , suggesting that amantadine can reduce depressive symptomatology and potentiate the antidepressant effects of monoaminergic drugs. In addition to its glutamatergic and dopaminergic effects , the potential antidepressant-like effects of amantadine have been linked to molecular and cellular actions , such as increased expression of neurotrophic factors ( e.g. , brain-derived neurotrophic factor) , activation of Ïƒ1 receptors , decreased corticosterone levels , and decreased inflammatory response to stress. Amantadine is an interesting candidate as new antidepressant drug for the treatment of
