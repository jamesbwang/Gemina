  Chemokines have been demonstrated to serve an important role in a variety of diseases , particularly in tumor progression. There have been numerous studies that have reported that T cells serve major roles in tumor progression. However , the function of CXC motif chemokine ligand 9 ( CXCL9) in prostate cancer remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of CXCL9 in prostate cancer. A prostate cancer mouse model was generated by treating C57/BL 6 and B6.Cg Selplgtm1Fur/J mice with 3,2 ' dimethyl 4‑aminobiphenyl ( DMAB). Hematoxylin and eosin staining detected the histopathological alterations of mouse prostate tissues. Immunohistochemistry ( IHC) staining determined cell proliferation of the mice. Flow cytometry was used to detect the alterations of T cells in C57 + DMAB or CXCL9 + DMAB mice. Immunofluorescence revealed that there was positive expression of interleukin‑6 ( IL‑6) and transforming growth factor ( TGF) β in the mouse tissues. The survival rates of C57 + DMAB and CXCL9 + DMAB mice was analyzed. The association of CXCL9 expression and clinical stages was also evaluated. Results revealed that prostate cancer pathology and cell proliferation in CXCL9 + DMAB mice were significantly greater compared with the C57 + DMAB mice. Compared with C57 + DMAB mice , the number of T cells in peripheral blood and spleen of CXCL9 + DMAB mice was significantly reduced. IHC demonstrated that the expression of IL‑6 and TGF‑β was significantly downregulated in the CXCL9 + DMAB mice. The survival rate of CXCL9 + DMAB mice was significantly decreased compared with the C57 + DMAB mice. In addition , reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that CXCL9 mRNA expression in clinical samples was positively associated with clinical pathological stages of prostate cancer. In conclusion , CXCL9 may promote prostate cancer progression via inhibition of cytokines from T cells.
