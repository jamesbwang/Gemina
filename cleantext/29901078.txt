  The development of type‑2 diabetes and its complications is associated with lipid metabolism disorder. Farnesoid X receptor ( FXR) has an important role in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism. However , the underlying mechanism of this remains unclear. The present study investigated the role of fexaramine ( Fex) , an FXR agonist , on lipid metabolism. For this purpose , 6‑week‑old db/db mice were treated with Fex for 8 weeks via oral gavage and db/db mice treated with corn oil were used as controls. Body<symptom> weight and food intake were monitored daily and bi‑weekly , respectively. A glucose tolerance test was performed during the final week of feeding. Blood samples were obtained for the analysis of lipids and enzymes related to hepatic function , and liver tissues were analyzed by histology and molecular examination. The results indicated that serum and liver triglyceride levels were decreased in db/db mice administered with Fex. Fewer small lipid droplets were observed in the liver. Small heterodimer partner ( SHP) , a downstream gene of FXR , was upregulated following Fex treatment. The mRNA and protein expression of genes associated with fatty acid oxidation ( acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase ( ACC) , carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1α ( CPT1‑α) and peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor‑coactivator‑1α) was also increased. Additionally , the expression of AMP‑activated protein kinase ( AMPK) was also increased. However , the expression of sterol‑regulatory element binding protein‑1c and fatty acid synthase , which are associated with fatty acid synthesis , was not significantly different. Taken together , the results of the present study suggested that activation of FXR and its downstream gene SHP may induce the AMPK‑ACC‑CPT1‑α signaling pathway , which promotes fatty acids oxidation , ultimately achieving its lipid‑lowering effect.
