  The de Winter electrocardiogram ( EKG) pattern is a novel sign that indicates left anterior descending coronary artery ( LAD) occlusion in patients with chest<symptom> pain<symptom>. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical characteristics of patients with this pattern. The de Winte EKG pattern is an special anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) equivalents without obvious ST-segment elevation. This retrospective study included all patients with anterior myocardial infarction admitted between January 2011 and December 2017. Patients were categorized into two groups: those with the de Winter EKG pattern and those with typical STEMI. Of 441 patients , 15 ( 3.4 %) with anterior myocardial infarction had the de Winter EKG pattern. Similar to those with typical STEMI , the majority of patients with the de Winter EKG pattern had ST-segment elevation , pathologic Q wave , and absence of R wave at follow-up. The median time from recognition of this pattern until its evolution was 114 min. The ST-segment in leads V3R-V5R and leads V7-V9 were normal or slightly depressed when a typical de Winter EKG pattern was noted in leads V1-V6. The culprit lesion<symptom> was mainly in the proximal LAD or the diagonal branch. Patients with this EKG pattern responded poorly to thrombolytic therapy. We believe that the de Winter EKG pattern may be a sign of ischemia and presents at the early stage of STEMI rather than being an independent pattern. In patients with this pattern , a percutaneous coronary intervention rather than follow-up and thrombolytic strategy should be performed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
