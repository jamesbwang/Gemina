  In this study , we investigate the reactions involving Atomic Layer Deposition ( ALD) of 2D-MoS2 from the heteroleptic precursor Mo ( NMe2) 2 ( NtBu) 2 and H2S as the co-reagent on a SiO2 ( 0001) surface by means of density functional theory ( DFT). All dominant reaction pathways from the early stage of adsorption of each ALD reagent to the formation of bulk-like Mo and S at the surface are identified. In the metal pulse , proton transfer from terminal OH groups on the SiO2 to the physisorbed metal precursor increases the Lewis acidity of Mo and Lewis basicity of O , which gives rise to the chemical adsorption of the metal precursor. Proton transfer from the surface to the dimethylamido ligands leads to the formation and desorption of dimethylamine. In contrast , the formation and desorption of tert-butylamine is not energetically favorable. The tert-butylimido ligand can only be partially protonated in the metal pulse. In the sulphur pulse , co-adsorption and dissociation of H2S molecules give rise to the formation and desorption of tert-butylamine. Through the calculated activation energies , the cooperation between H2S molecules ( ` cooperative ' mechanism) is shown to have a profound influence on the formation and desorption of tert-butylamine , which are crucial steps in the initial ALD deposition of 2D-MoS2 on SiO2. The cyclic ALD reactions give rise to the formation of a buffer layer which might have important consequences for the electrical and optical properties on the 2D layer formed in the subsequent homodeposition.
