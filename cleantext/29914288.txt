  Objective Hearing loss is a significant and growing problem as patients with cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF) live longer and experience frequent courses of intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics ( hereafter , `` IVs ''). This study seeks to document that risk in a large adult population with CF , accounting for age and aminoglycoside exposure. Study Design Retrospective case review of patients with CF who had multiple audiograms over years. Setting Tertiary care cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> setting. Subject and Methods The first and last audiograms recorded over a 10-year period were compared for 165 adult patients with CF. Patients were divided into 3 study groups: 34 patients with no intervening aminoglycoside IVs ( 0 IVs) , 103 patients with 1 to 9 IVs , and 28 patients with ≥ 10 IVs. Threshold shift ( TS) between the audiograms were examined for the 3 groups before and after age/sex adjustments. Two new hearing loss metrics were tested. Results At first examination , 48 % of patients ( average age , 30.0 years) already had hearing loss. At last examination ( average , 4.4 years later) , 64 % of the patients had hearing loss even with age/sex adjustment. Use of the age/sex hearing threshold adjustment eliminated the TS in the 0 IVs group. Two new metrics calculated for each patient demonstrated that 48 % of patients who had 1 to 9 IVs had ototoxic scores , while almost 80 % of the ≥ 10 IV group had ototoxic scores. Conclusion The majority of adult patients with CF are ( often repeatedly) exposed to parenteral aminoglycosides and lose hearing at a rate that far exceeds that predicted from aging alone.
