  This study aimed to examine whether the characteristics of mental health and sleep duration , alone or in combination , are associated with menstrual cycle irregularity. This population-based , cross-sectional study analyzed the data from 4445 women aged 19-49 years , who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2012. A structured questionnaire was used to assess mental health characteristics , sleep duration , and menstrual cycle irregularity. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. High stress , depressive mood , and suicidal ideation were associated with increased risk of menstrual cycle irregularity after adjusting for confounding variables ( odds ratio ( 95 % confidence interval) = 1.33 ( 1.07-1.65) , 1.56 ( 1.17-2.07) , and 1.37 ( 1.01-1.87) , respectively). Short sleep duration ( ≤ 5 h a day) was significantly associated with higher odds of severe menstrual cycle irregularity with menstrual interval of greater than 3 months ( 2.67 ( 1.35-5.27)). Participants with sleep duration of ≤ 5 h a day with psychological stress , depressive mood , or suicidal ideation had higher odds of menstrual cycle irregularity ( 1.96 ( 1.26-3.05) , 2.86 ( 1.50-5.44) , and 2.25 ( 1.18-4.29)). This study suggests positive associations of mental health problems and short sleep duration with menstrual cycle irregularity among Korean female adults. Therefore , strategies to deal with psychological stress , depressive mood , and sleep duration are needed for improving the reproductive health of women suffering from menstrual disturbances.
