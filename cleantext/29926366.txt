  To describe a clinical case of bilateral biopsy-proven IgG4-related disease confined to the tarsal plate. Interventional case report. A 58-year-old woman presented with a tarsal swelling in the lateral part of the upper eyelids , with focal ulceration and mucus. Histology revealed fibrotic inflammation<symptom> with increased IgG4-positive plasma cells fulfilling the criteria of IgG4-related disease ( IgG4-RD). Serum IgG4 levels were increased , and pathological fluorodeoxyglucose uptake at positron emission tomography/CT scanning was restricted to the upper eyelids. After treatment with oral and topical prednisone , the tarsal lesions<symptom> markedly regressed. Periorbital IgG4-RD may be confined to the tarsal plate. Treatment with systemic and topical steroids may induce significant regression.
