  Hypertension is the single most important risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke , a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Adherence to antihypertensive medication is essential to achieving strict blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control , but poor adherence is common in clinical practice. We evaluated adherence to antihypertensive medication in patients with acute hemorrhagic stroke and its effects on long-term outcome. This was a retrospective cohort study based on a nationwide health insurance claims database in South Korea. We included 1872 hypertensive patients who were admitted with acute hemorrhagic stroke during 2002 to 2013 ( 1354 cases of intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> and 518 cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom>). Adherence to antihypertensive medication was calculated using the proportion of days covered by any antihypertensive medication throughout the follow-up period ( categorized into poor < 40 %; intermediate 40 % -80 %; good > 80 %) and treated as a time-dependent variable. Primary outcome was defined as a composite of recurrent stroke ( hemorrhagic or ischemic) , myocardial infarction , or all-cause mortality. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed. During the mean follow-up period of 4.45 years , 634 patients had the primary outcome. The proportion of patients with good adherence to antihypertensive medication was 46.8 % at 1 year , 43.2 % at 3 years , and 41.7 % at 5 years of follow-up. Compared with good adherence , the adjusted hazard ratio ( 95 % confidence interval) for the primary outcome was 1.80 ( 1.49-2.16) for poor adherence and 1.56 ( 1.27-1.93) for intermediate adherence.
