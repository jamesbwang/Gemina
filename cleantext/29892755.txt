  A reactor for whole blood sampling integrated with instant protein digestion in a `` lab-on-paper '' format is introduced here. The sampling reactor was fabricated on commercially available filter paper using 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-2-vinyl-4,4-dimethyl azlactone ( HEMA-VDM) polymerization followed by the immobilization of trypsin. Immobilization conditions were investigated with respect to temperature , enzyme amount and immobilization time. The highest reactor efficiency with respect to protein digestion was obtained with 1.25 mg trypsin per reactor immobilized at room temperature for 3 hours. Commercially available cellulose filter papers and DMPK-C cards were modified and immobilized with trypsin prior to whole blood sampling. Filter paper specifications including thickness ( 180-220 μm) , weight ( 77-92 g m-2) and porosity ( 11-25 μm) were investigated with respect to performance ( digestion efficiency and extraction recovery). From this study , it was found that a medium thickness paper with higher weight and porosity is optimal for reactor efficiency. The reactors were tested and compared with respect to a standard dried blood spot procedure for protein digestion. The most efficient reactors obtained 134 ± 14 and 124 ± 7 high confidence protein groups for freeze thawed and fresh whole blood samples , respectively.
