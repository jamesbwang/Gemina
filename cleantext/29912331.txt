  To assess the determinants of airborne solvent exposures in contemporary vehicle collision repair workplaces. Personal , full-shift airborne solvent exposures ( n = 97) were assessed in 85 vehicle collision repair workers from 18 workshops. Peak exposures were assessed using a small number of video exposure monitoring measurements. Solvent exposures were highest in spray painters ( geometric mean = 2.7 ppm) followed by panel beaters ( 0.5 ppm) , but were well below workplace exposure standards. The lowest exposure levels were observed for mixing room extraction located away from the mixing bench ( exposure ratio ( ER) = 0.51 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.30-0.87). Time spent mixing paint was associated with higher exposures ( ER for every 10-min increase = 1.14 , 95 % CI = 1.05-1.24) , as was time spent cleaning equipment with solvents ( ER = 1.11 , 95 % CI = 0.88-1.39) , spraying primer ( ER = 1.10 , 95 % CI = 0.96-1.27) , and spraying clear coat paint ( ER = 1.07 , 95 % CI = 1.00-1.15). Overall , the combined non-spray painting tasks ( mixing paint , degreasing , and cleaning equipment) were more strongly associated with exposure ( ER = 1.10 , 95 % CI = 1.03-1.18) than the combined spray painting tasks ( ER = 1.03 , 95 % CI = 1.00-1.05). Peak exposures ranged from 10 to 1100 ppm with the strongest and most frequent peaks occurring during paint mixing , decanting of solvents , cleaning of equipment , and painting in a cross-draft spray booth. Airborne solvent exposures in the collision repair industry were associated with job title , the design and location of exhaust ventilation and emission sources , and time spent on specific tasks , with the highest average and peak exposures shown for non-spray painting tasks. These findings provide a contemporary basis for intervention programmes to reduce airborne solvent exposures in this industry.
