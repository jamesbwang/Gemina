  The purpose of this study was to determine incidence of concurrent peroneal nerve injury and to compare outcomes in patients with and without peroneal nerve injury after surgical treatment for multiligament knee injuries ( MLKIs). A retrospective study of 357 MLKIs was conducted. Patients with two or more knee ligaments requiring surgical reconstruction were included. Mean follow-up was 35 months ( 0-117). Incidence of concurrent peroneal nerve injury was noted and patients with and without nerve injury were evaluated for outcomes. Concurrent peroneal nerve injury occurred in 68 patients ( 19 %). In patients with nerve injury , 45 ( 73 %) returned to full duty at work; 193 ( 81 %) patients without nerve injury returned to full duty (
