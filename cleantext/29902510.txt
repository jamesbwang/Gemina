  Itraconazole is a fungicide drug which has low bioavailability due to its poor water solubility. Amorphous solid dispersion ( ASD) is a tool that has the potential to greatly increase the dissolution rate and extent of compounds. In this work , the dissolution of tablets containing the ASD of itraconazole with either hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ( HPMC) or vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer ( PVPVA) was compared in order to find a formulation which can prevent the drug from the precipitation caused by magnesium stearate. Formulations containing the PVPVA-based ASD with HPMC included in various forms could reach 90 % dissolution in 2 h , while HPMC-based ASDs could release 100 % of the drug. However , HPMC-based ASD had remarkably poor grindability and low bulk density , which limited its processability and applicability. The latter issue could be resolved by roller compacting the ASD , which significantly increases the bulk density and the flowability of the powder blends used for tableting. This roller compaction step might be a base for the industrial application of HPMC-based , electrospun ASDs.
