  Objective Higher-intensity counseling sessions increase the smoking abstinence rate. However , counselors are limited in Taiwan. This study was performed to determine whether the addition of one session with a specialist counselor increases the efficacy of a family physician-led smoking cessation program. Methods Participants opted to either visit a family physician for brief counseling and pharmacotherapy ( Po) or visit a specialist counselor for an initial session followed by a family physician for brief counseling sessions with pharmacotherapy ( P +). The 7-day point prevalence ( PP) rate was evaluated at weeks 12 and 24. Results In total , 356 patients were enrolled. In the intention-to-treat analysis , the PP rate at week 12 was higher in the Po than P + group , but there was no significant difference at week 24. In the per-protocol analysis , the PP rates at weeks 12 and 24 were not significantly different between the Po and P + groups. The adjusted odds ratios also revealed no significant differences in either the intention-to-treat analysis or the per-protocol analysis between the two groups. Conclusion The addition of one session with a specialist counselor had no benefit over the provision of counseling through a family physician at either 12 or 24 weeks of follow-up.
