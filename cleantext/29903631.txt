  Need to void level depends on two parameters , bladder volume and attentional process. If it is well known that the maximum voluntary contraction of the perineal muscles may transiently inhibit the micturition reflex itself , no work demonstrates the effect of this contraction on the intensity of the need itself. An experimental , prospective , open , monocentric study was conducted between March and April 2017. In total , 15 subjects with no neurological history or neuro-perineal disorders consulting for functional constipation<symptom> were included. Need to void level was evaluated by means of an electronic urgentometer. A control contraction of the dominant hand muscles was compared to a voluntary contraction of the external anal sphincter during a strong desire to void ( B3). These contractions were recorded by means of surface electromyography. The main evaluation criterion was the comparison between the difference in visual analogic scale of the desire to void before ( VAS-base) and after control voluntary contraction ( VAS-hand) versus the same index ( BAS-base then VAS-anal) after contraction of the external anal sphincter during a new B3. The comparison of maximum bladder capacities ( MBC) measured after each record was the secondary endpoint. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical analysis. Voiding desire VAS decreased significantly ( -13.14 ± 12 vs -1.5 ± 6; P = 0.03) and MBC increased significantly ( 502.43 ± 96.71 mL vs 435.78 ± 125.54 mL; P = 0.02) after anal compared to control contraction. This study suggests the existence of sensitive pathways inhibition by perineal contraction through a sensitive perineo-vesical inhibitory reflex. 3.
