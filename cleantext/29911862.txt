  Supramolecular chemistry protocols applied on surfaces offer compelling avenues for atomic-scale control over organic-inorganic interface structures. In this approach , adsorbate-surface interactions and two-dimensional confinement can lead to morphologies and properties that differ dramatically from those achieved via conventional synthetic approaches. Here , we describe the bottom-up , on-surface synthesis of one-dimensional coordination nanostructures based on an iron ( Fe)- terpyridine ( tpy) interaction borrowed from functional metal-organic complexes used in photovoltaic and catalytic applications. Thermally activated diffusion of sequentially deposited ligands and metal atoms and intraligand conformational changes lead to Fe-tpy coordination and formation of these nanochains. We used low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory to elucidate the atomic-scale morphology of the system , suggesting a linear tri-Fe linkage between facing , coplanar tpy groups. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals the highest occupied orbitals , with dominant contributions from states located at the Fe node , and ligand states that mostly contribute to the lowest unoccupied orbitals. This electronic structure yields potential for hosting photoinduced metal-to-ligand charge transfer in the visible/near-infrared. The formation of this unusual tpy/tri-Fe/tpy coordination motif has not been observed for wet chemistry synthetic methods and is mediated by the bottom-up on-surface approach used here , offering pathways to engineer the optoelectronic properties and reactivity of metal-organic nanostructures.
