  Severe frostbite occurs frequently at extreme altitude in the Himalayas , often resulting in amputations. Recent advances in treatment of frostbite injuries with either intravenous or intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator , or with iloprost , have improved outcomes in frostbite injuries , but only if the patient has access to these within 24 to 48 h postinjury , and ideally even sooner. Frostbitten Himalayan climbers are seldom able to reach medical care in this time frame. We wished to see if delayed iloprost use ( up to 72 h) would help reduce tissue loss in grade 3 to 4 frostbite. In a series of 5 consecutive climbers with severe frostbite in whom we used iloprost , 4 of whom received treatment between 48 and 72 h from injury , 2 had excellent results with minimal tissue loss , and 2 had good results with tissue loss less than expected. The 1 patient with a poor outcome likely experienced a freeze-thaw-refreeze injury. This small series suggests that iloprost can be beneficial for severe frostbite , even after the standard 48-h window and perhaps for up to 72 h.
