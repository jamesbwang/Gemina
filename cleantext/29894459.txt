  Malignant melanoma predominantly occurs in whites , and is potentially fatal. Distant metastases often occur in lung , liver , brain , and could occur without prior regional disease. Conjunctival melanoma metastasis to contralateral orbit has never been reported. A 60-year-old man who underwent a left primary conjunctival neoplasm resection 11 months ago presented for the evaluation of a conjunctival dark-colored mass with a bulging left lower eyelid that directly invaded the orbits bilaterally. A histopathologic examination and immunohistochemistry confirmed metastases from conjunctival melanoma. In addition , the contralateral orbit had metastases without local recurrence after surgery within the authors ' department. The patient was given adjuvant therapy ( vincristine + nedaplatin + dacarbazine) for 5 cycles , but he died 8 months after surgery. Malignant conjunctival melanoma may metastasize to the contralateral orbit. A histopathologic evaluation should be mandatory in patients with medical histories of malignancy to differentiate new primary tumors , metastases , and benign tumors.
