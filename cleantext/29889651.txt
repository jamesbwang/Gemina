  The peroxidase ( POD) enzyme , obtained from different sources , has been described in the literature regarding its good results of reduction in concentration or degradation levels of mycotoxins , such as aflatoxin B1 , deoxynivalenol and zearalenone. This study aimed at evaluating the action of commercial peroxidase and peroxidase from soybean bran ( SB) and rice bran ( RB) in zearalenone ( ZEA) reduction in a model solution and the characterization of the mechanism of enzyme action. POD was extracted from SB and RB in phosphate buffer by orbital agitation. Evaluation of the action of commercial POD and POD from SB and RB in ZEA reduction was carried out in phosphate buffer and aqueous solution , respectively. Parameters of K
