  Ataxia<symptom> is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from brainstem , cerebellar , and/or spinocerebellar tracts impairments. Symptoms onset could vary widely from childhood to late-adulthood. Autosomal cerebellar ataxias<symptom> are considered as one of the most complex group in neurogenetics. In addition to their genetic heterogeneity , there is an important phenotypic variability in the expression of cerebellar impairment , complicating the genetic mutation research. A pattern recognition approach using brain MRI measures of atrophy , hyperintensities and iron-induced hypointensity of the dentate nuclei , could be therefore helpful in guiding genetic research. This review will discuss a pattern recognition approach that , associated with the age at disease onset , and clinical manifestations , may help neuroradiologists differentiate the most frequent profiles of
