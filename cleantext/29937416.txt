  Obesity is an increasing problem worldwide that can influence perioperative and postoperative outcomes. However , the relationship between obesity and treatment-related perioperative and short-term postoperative morbidity after colorectal resections is still subject to debate. Patients were selected from the DCRA , a population-based audit including 83 hospitals performing colorectal cancer ( CRC) surgery. Data regarding primary resections between 2009 and 2016 were eligible for analyses. Patients were subdivided into six categories: underweight , normal weight , overweight and obesity class I , II and III. Of 71,084 patients , 17.7 % with colon and 16.4 % with rectal cancer were categorized as obese. Significant differences were found for the 30-day overall postoperative complication rate ( p < 0.001) , prolonged hospitalization ( p < 0.001) and readmission rate ( colon cancer p < 0.005; rectal cancer p < 0.002) in obese CRC patients. Multivariate analysis identified BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m The real-life data analysed in this study reflect daily practice in the Netherlands and identify obesity as a significant risk factor in CRC patients. Obesity-related comorbidities were associated with higher postoperative morbidity , prolonged hospitalization and a higher readmission rate in obese CRC patients. No differences were observed between hospitals performing bariatric surgery and hospitals that did not.
