  Severe radiation-related lymphopenia is common and associated with decreased survival in patients with several solid tumors. As the mechanisms underlying systemic lymphopenia are poorly understood , we developed an animal model to study the effects of brain radiation on lymphocytes and cytokines. C57 BL/6 and BALB/c mice received focal brain irradiation ( 4 Gy x 10 fractions or 2 Gy x 30 fractions). Weekly total lymphocyte<symptom> counts ( TLC) , lymphocyte<symptom> subsets and cytokines in blood and lymph nodes were measured. Non-irradiated lymph nodes were collected and examined before , during , and after radiation. We found that systemic TLC decreased rapidly irrespective of mouse strain or radiation schedule. 4 Gy x 10 resulted in a 42 % and 75 % & 70 % and 49 % TLC reduction in C57 BL/6 and BALB/c mice respectively. 2 Gy x 30 caused a 70 %/ 49 % decrease in TLC in C57 BL/6 and BALB/c. Similar trends were seen for total T cells , CD4
