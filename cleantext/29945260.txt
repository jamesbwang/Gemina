  This study evaluates knowledge of and attitudes toward human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) infection and vaccination among healthcare professionals and the general public in Slovenia. Five statements were designed to evaluate participants ' opinions regarding age at HPV<pathogen> vaccine administration and potential delay in vaccination , associations of HPV<pathogen> vaccination with riskier sexual behavior , HPV<pathogen> vaccine safety , the importance of the internet as a source of information , and the significance of HPV<pathogen> vaccination in boys. Participants were asked to express agreement or disagreement with each statement. A total of 605 surveys were completed by medical students ( n = 259) , parents of sixth-graders in 2016 ( n = 103) and 2017 ( n = 103) , pediatricians and school medicine specialists ( n = 21) , gynecologists ( n = 34) , and women visiting gynecology outpatient clinics ( n = 85). The highest level of knowledge and belief in the HPV<pathogen> vaccine and its safety was observed among pediatricians and school medicine specialists. Medical students tend to have a very positive attitude toward HPV<pathogen> vaccination , although they need additional education about HPV<pathogen> vaccine safety. Some healthcare professionals showed signs of HPV<pathogen> vaccine hesitancy , and their beliefs were somewhat similar to those of the general public. Although the overall attitude towards HPV<pathogen> vaccination is generally positive , additional education must be provided to both healthcare professionals and the general public in order to achieve higher HPV<pathogen> vaccination coverage rates in Slovenia.
