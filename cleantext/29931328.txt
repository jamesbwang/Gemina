  Nutrient overload occurs worldwide as a consequence of the modern diet pattern and the physical inactivity that sometimes accompanies it. Cells initiate multiple protective mechanisms to adapt to elevated intracellular metabolites and restore metabolic homeostasis , but irreversible injury to the cells can occur in the event of prolonged nutrient overload. Many studies have advanced the understanding of the different detrimental effects of nutrient overload; however , few reports have made connections and given the full picture of the impact of nutrient overload on cellular metabolism. In this review , detailed changes in metabolic and energy homeostasis caused by chronic nutrient overload , as well as their associations with the development of metabolic disorders , are discussed. Overnutrition-induced changes in key organelles and sensors rewire cellular bioenergetic pathways and facilitate the shift of the metabolic state toward biosynthesis , thereby leading to the onset of various metabolic disorders , which are essentially the downstream manifestations of a misbalanced metabolic equilibrium. Based on these mechanisms , potential therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders and new research directions are proposed.
