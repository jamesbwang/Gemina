  Retroperitoneal liposarcoma is a rare type of cancer. Relapse after surgery is frequent , and relapsing tumors tend to be more aggressive and less differentiated each episode , worsening the prognosis. This report describes the case of a 42-year-old female diagnosed with retroperitoneal liposarcoma after complete tumor resection. At the 3-month follow-up , another expansive lipomatous mass in the retroperitoneal area almost the same size as the previous one was detected. The patient underwent a new surgery , followed by first-line treatment with a gemcitabine- and docetaxel-based regimen for 8 cycles. Finally , the patient achieved complete tumor remission confirmed by CT after the end of the treatment proposed. Although recurrence is a well-known characteristic of this neoplasia , no other case with such a vast expansion of a new tumor shortly after complete resection was found in the literature.
