  Hospitalizations of chronic dialysis patients have not been previously studied at a national level in Canada. Understanding the scope and variables associated with hospitalizations will inform measures for improvement. To describe the risk of all-cause and infection-related hospitalizations in patients on dialysis. Retrospective cohort study using health care administrative databases. Provinces and territories across Canada ( excluding Manitoba and Quebec). Incident chronic dialysis patients with a dialysis start date between January 1 , 2005 , and March 31 , 2014. Patients with a prior history of kidney transplantation were excluded. Patient characteristics were recorded at baseline. Dialysis modality was treated as a time-varying covariate. The primary outcomes of interest were all-cause and dialysis-specific infection-related hospitalizations. Crude rates for all-cause hospitalization and infection-related hospitalization were determined per patient year ( PPY) at 7 and 30 days , and at 3 , 6 , and 12 months postdialysis initiation. A stratified , gamma-distributed frailty model was used to assess repeat hospital admissions and to determine the inter-recurrence dependence of hospitalizations within individuals , as well as the hazard ratio ( HR) attributed to each covariate of interest. A total of 38 369 incident chronic dialysis patients were included: 38 088 adults and 281 pediatric patients ( age less than 18 years). There were 112 374 hospitalizations , of which 11.5 % were infection-related hospitalizations. The all-cause hospitalization rate was similar for all adult age groups ( age 65 years and older: 1.40 , 1.35 , and 1.18 admissions PPY at 7 days , 30 days , and 6 months , respectively). The all-cause hospitalization rate was higher for pediatric patients ( 1.67 , 2.48 , and 2.47 admissions PPY at 7 days , 30 days , and 6 months , respectively; adjusted HR: 2.73 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 2.37-3.15 , referent age group: 45-64 years). Within the first 7 days after dialysis initiation , patients on peritoneal dialysis had a higher risk of all-cause hospitalization ( HR: 1.27 , 95 % CI: 1.07-1.50) and infection-related hospitalization ( HR: 2.05 , 95 % CI: 1.19-3.55) compared with patients on hemodialysis. Beyond 7 days , the risk did not differ significantly by dialysis modality. Female sex and Indigenous race were significant risk factors for all-cause hospitalization. The cohort had too few home hemodialysis patients to examine this subgroup. The outcome of infection-related hospitalization was determined using diagnostic codes. Dialysis patients from Manitoba and Quebec were not included. In Canada , the rates of hospitalization were not influenced by dialysis modality beyond the initial 7-day period following dialysis initiation; however , the rate of hospitalization in pediatric patients was higher than in adults at every time frame examined.
