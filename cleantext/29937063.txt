  Primary recurrent cutaneous eosinophilic vasculitis is a rare condition characterized by pruritic , erythematous , purpuric plaques associated to edema<symptom>. We compared and analyze the clinical , dermoscopic and histological features of the disease in 4 patients from our hospital and 13 patients published in the literature. Seventeen patients were included , with a median age of 56yo , a median duration of disease of 6 months. Lesions<symptom> were most frequently generalized ( 47 %) or localized in lower limbs ( 41 %). The most frequent features were purpuric color ( 71 %) , local edema<symptom> ( 65 %) , necrotizing vasculitis ( 94 %) and eosinophil infiltration ( 100 %) in histology. Most of the patients ( 82.4 %) were given oral steroids with a median dose of 30 mg. Primary recurrent cutaneous eosinophilic vasculitis might be an infra-diagnosed condition. The analysis of the patients allowed us to propose diagnostic criteria for the definition of this disease. We suggest a therapeutic strategy with high-potency steroids and dapsone , which might be considered as first-line treatment.
