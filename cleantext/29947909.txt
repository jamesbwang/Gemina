  Ellagic acid ( EGA)- enriched dietary supplements are widely acclaimed , owing to its versatile bioactivities. Previously , we reported that chronic administration of EGA prevented the impairment of cognitive abilities in rats using the intracerebroventricular-administered streptozotocin ( STZ-ICV) model of Alzheimer 's disease. Impairment of phosphoinositide 3 ( PI3)- kinase-regulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS) activity by central administration of STZ in rodents instigates dementia. The aim of the present study was to delineate the role of PI3-kinase-eNOS activity in the prevention of STZ-ICV-induced memory<symptom> dysfunctions<symptom> by EGA. The Morris water maze and elevated plus maze tests were conducted , and brain oxidative stress markers ( TBARS , GSH , SOD , CAT) , nitrite , acetylcholinesterase ( AChE) , LDH , TNF-α and eNOS were quantified. Administration of EGA ( 35 mg/k , p.o.) for 4 weeks daily attenuated the STZ-ICV ( 3 mg/kg)- triggered increase of brain oxidative stress , nitrite and TNF-α levels; AChE and LDH activity; and decline of brain eNOS activity. The memory restoration by EGA in STZ-ICV-treated rats was conspicuously impaired by N
