  A methoxy ( alkenyl) carbenerhodium complex ( RhCp * Cl ( ( double bond , length as m-dash) C ( OMe) CH ( double bond , length as m-dash) CPh2) ( PMe3)) PF6 ( 2) has been synthesized and used as the starting material for the study of the effect of the metal center ( Rh vs. Ir) in the formation of new rhodacycle complexes. While η3 and η5 indenylrhodium complexes have been achieved by the C-H bond activation of a phenyl ring , insertion of terminal alkynes into the rhodium-carbene bond led to the first example of the synthesis of rhodafuran complexes through rhoda-1,3,5-hexatriene intermediates. This new method represents an efficient process to obtain metallafuran complexes.
