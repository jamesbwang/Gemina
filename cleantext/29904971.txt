  The role of sensitization to commercially available allergens of English walnut ( Juglans regia) Jug r 1 , 2 and 3 in walnut allergy has been previously investigated in walnut allergic adults and was unable to explain all cases of walnut allergy. Identify recognized walnut allergens , other than the ones previously investigated ( Jug r 1-3) , in walnut allergic adults and determine the sensitization frequency and diagnostic value. Three different in-house walnut extracts were prepared and analysed on SDS-PAGE blots to identify allergenic walnut proteins. Immunoblots and immunoprecipitation , followed by LC-MS analysis , were performed to screen for , and confirm , IgE binding to walnut allergens in selected walnut allergic adults. In a cohort of 55 walnut challenged adults , including 33 allergic and 22 tolerant , sensitization to native and recombinant walnut allergen Jug r 4 was assessed using immunoblotting and immuno-line blot ( EUROLINE) , respectively. Screening of sera of 8 walnut allergic adults identified Jug r 4 as an allergen in our population. In the total cohort of 55 subjects , 5 were positive for Jug r 4 on immunoblot and 10 on EUROLINE. All but one EUROLINE positive subject had a positive food challenge ( sensitivity 27 % , specificity 95 % , PPV 90 % , NPV 47 %). All 5 subjects positive on immunoblot were also positive on EUROLINE. LC-MS analysis showed a lack of Jug r 4 in the ImmunoCAP extract. Co-sensitization to other 11S albumins ( eg hazelnut Cor a 9) was common in Jug r 4 sensitized subjects , potentially due to cross-reactivity. Walnut 11S globulin Jug r 4 is a relevant minor allergen , recognized by 27 % of walnut allergic adults. It has a high positive predictive value of 90 % for walnut allergy. Specific IgE against Jug r 4 occurred mostly with concomitant sensitization to other walnut components , mainly Jug r 1.
