  There are five basic taste qualities , umami , sweet , bitter , salty and sour tastes. These taste qualities are transduced through corresponding taste receptors that reside on taste cells in the oral cavity. Unlike salty or sour receptors , receptors for umami , sweet and bitter belong to G protein coupled receptor family. Recently , it has become apparent that taste receptors are localized in various cells and tissues other than those in the oral cavity , which similarly function for taste transduction. In this review , we will discuss expression and function of these taste receptors based on knowledge accumulated.
