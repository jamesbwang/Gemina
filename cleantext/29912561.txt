  As a part of our efforts to expand chemical diversity in the carbonic anhydrases inhibitors ( CAIs) , three small series of polyheterocyclic compounds ( 4-6) featuring the primary benzenesulfonamide moiety linked to bi/tricyclic scaffolds were investigated. Highly effective inhibitors against the target tumor-associated hCA IX ( low nanomolar/subnanomolar potency levels) showing significant functional selectivity profile toward hCA I , II , and IV isozymes were identified. Molecular docking studies clarified the reasons behind the activity and selectivity of the new compounds.
