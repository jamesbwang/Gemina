  Surgical strategies for perforated diverticulitis ( Hinchey stages III and IV) remain controversial. This systematic review aimed to compare the outcome of primary anastomosis , Hartmann procedure and laparoscopic lavage. A systematic literature search was conducted through Medline , Embase , Cochrane Central Register and Health Technology Assessment Database to identify randomized and non-randomized controlled trials involving patients with perforated left-sided colonic diverticulitis comparing different surgical strategies. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed systematically ( Grading of Recommendations , Assessment , Development and Evaluation) and a meta-analysis was performed. After screening 4090 titles and abstracts published between 1958 and January 2018 , 148 were selected for full text assessment. Sixteen trials ( 7 RCTs , 9 non-RCTs) with 1223 patients were included. Mortality rates were not significantly different between Hartmann procedure and primary anastomosis for Hinchey III and IV , neither in the meta-analysis of three RCTs ( RR 2.03 ( 95 % CI 0.79 to 5.25); p = 0.14 , moderate quality of evidence) nor in the meta-analysis of six observational studies ( RR 1.53 ( 95 % CI 0.89 to 2.65); p = 0.13 , very low quality of evidence). However , stoma reversal rates were significantly higher in the primary anastomosis group ( RR 0.73 ( 95 % CI 0.58 to 0.98); p = 0.008 , moderate quality of evidence). Meta-analysis of four RCTs showed no significant difference between laparoscopic lavage for Hinchey III compared to sigmoid resection neither for mortality ( RR 1.07 ( 95 % CI 0.65 to 1.76); p = 0.79 , moderate quality of evidence) nor for major complications ( RR 0.86 ( 95 % CI 0.69 to 1.08); p = 0.20 , moderate quality of evidence). This systematic review suggests similar rates of complications but higher rates of colonic restoration after primary anastomosis compared to Hartmann procedure in perforated diverticulitis with generalized peritonitis<disease> ( Hinchey III and IV). Results in laparoscopic lavage for Hinchey III are not superior to primary resection. However , further studies with a careful interpretation of the meaning of re-interventions are required.
