  With better surgical outcomes , quicker recovery times , decreased postoperative pain , and reduced scarring at the surgical site , the application of minimally invasive surgery ( MIS) has gained a lot of prominence in the last 30 years. This change in surgical practice has taken away the ability of a surgeon to palpate for the presence of a blood vessel as would occur in an open procedure. They instead must rely on a laparoscopic video camera feed that unfortunately can not detect the presence of a blood vessel hidden beneath tissue. In certain scenarios , a surgeon can accidentally cut a blood vessel , which can lead to severe , even fatal , complications. Here , we show that by adding a near-infrared LED and a photodiode onto the opposing jaws of laparoscopic graspers , blood vessels buried under tissue can be detected. We show the results of Monte Carlo simulations to support our theory that the blood vessels ranging from 3 to 6 mm buried under up to 1 cm of tissue can be detected and quantified. This technology could be added to already existing laparoscopic tools that have limited surface areas on the jaws<symptom> to assist surgeons during MIS procedures.
