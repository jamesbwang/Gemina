  Research investigating the social context of adolescent nonsuicidal self-injury ( NSSI) has been limited. We therefore examined social characteristics of NSSI , such as knowledge of friends ' NSSI and the role friends play in continuing NSSI , and their relationships to other known NSSI correlates , such as suicidality. We assessed NSSI characteristics , including social features , in a community sample of 89 self-injuring adolescents. We also assessed psychosocial correlates of NSSI , including impulsivity , self-concept , and psychiatric symptoms. Knowledge of friends ' NSSI was relatively common among self-injurers. In addition , knowledge of friends ' NSSI was associated with use of more NSSI methods , cutting behaviors , and suicidal ideation , but not with other NSSI correlates. However , teaching or encouragement of NSSI by friends was rare. Knowledge of friends ' NSSI may serve as marker of increased severity among adolescent self-injurers. These findings have implications for identifying and intervening with high-risk self-injuring youth.
