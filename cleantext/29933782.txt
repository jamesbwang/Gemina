  Lower gastrointestinal bleeding is bleeding from a colonic source. Rapid colon purge using 4 to 6 L of polyethylene glycol followed by early colonoscopy , within 24 hours of presentation , is recommended to optimize the detection and management of bleeding sources. Although the data are mixed , early colonoscopy seems to be associated with higher detection of bleeding lesions<symptom> and therapeutic interventions. There is no clear benefit for early colonoscopy in terms of reduced duration of stay , rebleeding , transfusion requirement , or surgery compared with patients undergoing elective colonoscopy. Further studies are needed to determine the effect of early colonoscopy on clinically important outcomes.
