  The lasting behavioral changes elicited by social signals provide important adaptations for survival of organisms that thrive as a group. Unlike the rapid innate responses to social cues , such adaptations have been understudied. Here , the rodent models of the lasting socially induced behavioral changes are presented as either modulations or reinforcements of the distinct forms of learning and memory or non-associative changes of affective state. The purpose of this categorization is to draw attention to the potential mechanistic links between the neuronal pathways that process social cues and the neuronal systems that mediate the well-studied forms of learning and memory.
