  White adipose tissue ( eWAT) plays a crucial role in preventing metabolic syndrome<disease>. We aimed to investigate WAT distribution and gene expression and lipidomic profiles in epididymal WAT ( eWAT) in diet-induced obese mice , reflecting a Western-style diet of humans to elucidate the bioactive properties of the dietary antioxidant curcumin in preventing lifestyle-related diseases. For 16 weeks , we fed C57BL/6J mice with a control diet , a high-fat , high-sucrose and high-cholesterol Western diet or Western diet supplemented with 0.1 % ( w/w) curcumin. Although the dietary intake of curcumin did not affect eWAT weight or plasma lipid levels , it reduced lipid peroxidation markers ' levels in eWAT. Curcumin accumulated in eWAT and changed gene expressions related to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 ( eIF2) signalling. Curcumin suppressed eIF2α phosphorylation , which is induced by endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress , macrophage accumulation and nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB) p65 and leptin expression , whereas it 's anti-inflammatory effect was inadequate to decrease TNF-α and IFN-γ levels. Lipidomic and gene expression analysis revealed that curcumin decreased some diacylglycerols ( DAGs) and DAG-derived glycerophospholipids levels by suppressing the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1 and adipose triglyceride lipase expression , which are associated with lipogenesis and lipolysis , respectively. Presumably , these intertwined effects contribute to metabolic syndrome<disease> prevention by dietary modification.
