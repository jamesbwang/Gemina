  Alternative approaches in Medicaid are proliferating under the Trump administration. Using a novel telephone survey , we assessed views on health savings accounts , work requirements , and Medicaid expansion. Our sample consisted of 2,739 low-income nonelderly adults in three Midwestern states: Ohio , which expanded eligibility for traditional Medicaid; Indiana , which expanded Medicaid using health savings accounts called POWER accounts; and Kansas , which has not expanded Medicaid. We found that coverage rates in 2017 were significantly higher in the two expansion states than in Kansas. However , cost-related barriers were more common in Indiana than in Ohio. Among Medicaid beneficiaries eligible for Indiana 's waiver program , 39 percent had not heard of POWER accounts , and only 36 percent were making required payments , which means that nearly two-thirds were potentially subject to loss of benefits or coverage. In Kansas , 77 percent of respondents supported expanding Medicaid. With regard to work requirements , 49 percent of potential Medicaid enrollees in Kansas were already employed , 34 percent were disabled , and only 11 percent were not working but would be more likely to look for a job if required by Medicaid. These findings suggest that current Medicaid innovations may lead to unintended consequences for coverage and access.
