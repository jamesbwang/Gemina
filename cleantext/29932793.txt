  Selegiline hydrochloride ( SL) is chosen as an adjunct for the control of clinical signs of Parkinsonian patients. The aim of the present work is to develop and optimize thermosensitive gels using Pluronic ( F-127) for enhancing transport of SL into the brain through the nasal route. SL gels were prepared using a cold method and the Box-Behnken experimental design methodology. Drug ( SL) , gelling agent ( F-127) and emulsifier ( Propylene glycol , PG) were selected as independent variables while the gelation temperature , gel strength , pH , gel content , and gel erosion were considered as dependent variables. For further understanding of the interaction between the various variables , contour plots and surface plots were also applied. Selected formulations , like S10 ( contain 25 mg SL , 20 g F-127 , and 1 g PG) and S14 ( contain 50 mg SL , 18 g F-127 and 1 g PG) , had a clear appearance in the sol form , with gelling temperature of the nasal gel ranging between 33 and 34 , respectively. The gel strength of the formulations varied from 4.67 and 0.68 mm and the drug content was 100 %. The pH of the formulations ranged between 6.71 and 7.11. Detachment force was acceptable ( 63.69-244.16 N/cm2) to provide prolonged adhesion. In vitro , drug release studies showed that the prepared formulations could release SL for up to 8 h. Permeation flux for the S10 gel was 0.0002 mg/min/cm
