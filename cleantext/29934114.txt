  Gaucher disease ( GD) is one of the most common lysosomal storage diseases resulting from a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. Three main types have been described , with type 2 being the most rare and severe form. Here we investigated the clinical symptoms and mutation spectrum in 20 unrelated type 2 GD patients. The diagnosis of GD was based on the acid Î²-glucocerebrosidase ( GBA) enzyme activity and direct sequencing of the GBA gene. GBA activity was measured in leukocytes and the GBA gene was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR). For patient 7 , the GBA gene was analyzed by PCR as well as quantitative real-time PCR. The age of onset was under 12 months for all patients. All patients experienced severe neurological involvement. A total of 19 different GBA gene mutations were identified , including 6 novel mutations: two were exonic point mutations , c. 1127T > C ( p.Phe376Ser) , c. 1418T > G ( p.Val473Gly); one was splicing error , ISV7-1G > C; one was insertion , c. 717_718insACAG; and the other two were a gross deletion that involved exon 6 and a recombinant allele. The most prevalent mutation was Leu483Pro , which constituted 42.5 % of all mutant alleles and was associated with a neurological form in Chinese GD patients as calculated by a Fisher 's exact test. The clinical characteristics of Chinese type 2 GD were consistent with reports from other ethnic populations. We identified 6 novel mutations that contribute to the spectrum of GBA gene mutations. Our study confirmed that GD patients with the Leu483Pro allele were prone to experience
