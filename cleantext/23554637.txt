  The aim of this study was to determine the effects of plant essential oil supplementation on growth performance , immune function and antioxidant activities in weaned pigs. In the study , 24 weaned pigs were used to explore the effects of plant essential oil ( PEO) on growth performance , immune properties and antioxidant activities. Pigs were fed with a basal diet ( CON) or basal diet containing different concentrations of PEO ( PEO50: 50 ppm; PEO100: 100 ppm; PEO200: 200 ppm). After 3 weeks , all pigs were slaughtered and blood and tissue samples were collected for biochemical analysis. The results showed that PEO supplementation quadratically increased body<symptom> weight gain ( BWG) ( P = 0.031) , linearly ( P < 0.05) and quadratically ( P < 0.05) decreased F: G. In addition , IgG increased linearly ( P < 0.05) and IgM increased linearly ( P < 0.05) and quadratically ( P < 0.05) as PEO supplementation. Similarly , MDA in serum , jejunal mucosa and pancreas were linearly decreased ( P < 0.05) and GSH in serum ( linear and quadratic , P < 0.05) , duodenal mucosa ( linear and quadratic , P < 0.05) and in ileal mucosa ( linear and quadratic , P < 0.05) were notably increased. Futhermore , antioxidant-related genes expression levels of GST in spleen ( linear and quadratic , P < 0.05) , GPX1 ( quadratic , P < 0.05) and SOD1 ( linear , P < 0.05) in spleen and GST in liver ( quadratic , P < 0.05) were markedly upregulated by PEO supplementation increasing. These results suggest that PEO improves growth performance , immune function , and antioxidant activities in weaned pigs , and it may also relieve weaning stress if used as a feed additive in the livestock industry. And that supplementation 200 ppm PEO in diet would seem to be economically feasible.
