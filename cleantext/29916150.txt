  In eutrophic lake restorations , in situ capping is an often considered method to control sediment internal phosphorus ( P) pollution for mitigating eutrophication status. Subsequent aquatic macrophyte revegetation can directly derive P from the sediment for growth. However , the effects of capping with clean soils on internal P release from sediments under rooted aquatic macrophyte revegetation are still unclear. In the present study , the influences of sediment P remobilization by P. australis<pathogen> revegetation on P inactivation by capping were investigated based on an entire growth simulation study. Our findings showed during the growth of P. australis<pathogen> , tests conducted on total phosphorous ( TP) , calcium-bound P ( Ca-P) , loosely bound P ( loose-P) , organic P ( Org-P) , and iron-adsorbed P ( Fe-P) found significant changes ( p < 0.001). Specifically , the mean contents of TP and Ca-P decreased by 291.1 and 224.2 mg kg
