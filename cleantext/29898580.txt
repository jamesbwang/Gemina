  Research has shown that intranasal oxytocin affects social cognition and behavior; however , its effects vary based on social context , individual characteristics and dose. The present study aimed to determine effective dose of oxytocin spray on emotion recognition in healthy Korean males. The study followed a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled design. Thirty-seven Korean males underwent two experimental sessions , with one week in between. They received either 32 ( n = 19) or 40 ( n = 18) international units ( IU) of oxytocin and placebo , and then completed a face emotion recognition task. The effect of oxytocin on emotion recognition was examined using repeated measures analysis of variance ( ANOVA) for each dose condition. The higher dose ( 40 IU) was found to improve recognition of happy faces , while the lower dose ( 32 IU) had no effect. There were no statistical differences in age , education , attachment style or empathic ability between the two dose groups. The results suggest that oxytocin increases the ability of Korean males to recognize positive emotion , and this effect is dose-dependent. Additional studies evaluating the effect of higher doses of oxytocin on social cognition will help to determine the optimal dose for Korean populations.
