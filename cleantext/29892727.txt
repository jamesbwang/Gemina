  Cationic Lewis base-free Î²-diketiminate ( BDI) complexes of Mg and Ca have been isolated as their B ( C6F5) 4- salts. The cation ( BDI) Mg + shows an extraordinarily strong Lewis acidity that can compete with strong Lewis acids like B ( C6F5) 3 and ( BDI) AlMe +. Its highly electrophilic nature is exemplified by isolation of an 3-hexyne adduct.
