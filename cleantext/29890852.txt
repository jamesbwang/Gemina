  Angiogenesis plays an essential role in the growth and metastasis of tumor cells , and the modulation of angiogenesis can be an effective approach for cancer therapy. We focused on silencing the angiogenic gene PLXDC1 as an important factor for anti-angiogenesis tumor therapy. Herein , we developed PLXDC1 small interfering siRNA ( siRNA)- incorporated chitosan nanoparticle ( CH-NP/siRNA) coated with hyaluronic acid ( HA) to target the CD44 receptor on tumor endothelial cells. This study aimed to improve targeted delivery and enhance therapeutic efficacy for tumor anti-angiogenesis. The HA-CH-NP/siRNA was 200 Â± 10 nm in size with a zeta potential of 26.4 mV. The loading efficiency of siRNA to the HA-CH-NP/siRNA was up to 60 %. The selective binding of HA-CH-NP/siRNA to CD44-positive tumor endothelial cells increased by 2.1-fold compared with that of the CD44 nontargeted CH-NP/siRNA. PLXDC1 silencing by the HA-CH-NP/siRNA significantly inhibited tumor growth in A2780 tumor-bearing mice compared with that in the control group ( p < .01) , and mRNA expression of PLXDC1 was significantly reduced in the HA-CH-NP/siRNA-treated group. Furthermore , treatment with HA-CH-NP/siRNA resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation ( p < .001) , reduced microvessel density ( p < .001) , and increased cell apoptosis ( p < .001). This study demonstrates that HA-CH-NP/siRNA is a highly selective delivery platform for siRNA , and has broad potential to be used in anti-angiogenesis tumor therapy.
