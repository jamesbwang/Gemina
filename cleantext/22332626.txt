  Feline relocation is used increasingly in animal welfare to decrease shelter euthanasia rates and increase positive outcomes. Concerns about infectious<disease> disease<disease> introduction and transmission are often expressed; however , little research has been conducted on even the baseline prevalence of infectious<disease> disease<disease> following relocation. This study , which collected data on 430 cats relocated through an established program over 7 months , evaluated the prevalence of upper respiratory<disease> infection<disease> ( URI) , feline panleukopenia virus ( FPV) and dermatophytosis<disease> at one destination agency. The period prevalence was 25.8 % for URI , 1.6 % for FPV and 0.9 % for dermatophytosis<disease> Mixed-effects logistic regression was performed to investigate factors associated with URI. Younger age , increased time in transport , and increased length of stay at the destination agency were associated with increased URI prevalence following relocation. The findings of this study reveal that certain highly contagious and environmentally persistent infectious<disease> diseases<disease> , such as FPV and dermatophytosis<disease> , are uncommon following relocation in an established program; however , URI in relocated cats should be proactively managed. Animal welfare agencies can use this information to guide shelter and relocation operations and mitigate the impact of URI in relocated cats.
