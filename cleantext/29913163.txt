  Consistent results suggest the promoting roles of serine racemase ( SR)/ D-serine in retinal neurodegeneration in diabetic retinopathy ( DR). However , the direct evidence connecting SR deficiency with retinal neuroprotection in genetic model of diabetes mellitus has not been reported. In this investigation , we explore the effect of absence of functional SR on the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs) with a diabetic murine model , Ins2
