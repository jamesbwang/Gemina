  Catheter-related blood-stream infections ( CRBSIs) are the most common complication when using central venous catheters ( CVCs). Whether coating CVCs under bundles could further reduce the incidence of CRBSIs is unclear. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of implementing the use of bundles with antimicrobial-coated CVCs for preventing catheter-related blood-stream infections. In this systematic review and network meta-analyses , we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library in addition to the EMBASE , MEDLINE , CINAHL , and Web of Science databases for studies published before July 2017. The primary outcome was the rate of CRBSIs per 1000 catheter-days , and the secondary outcome was the incidence of catheter colonization. Twenty-three studies revealed significant differences in the rate of CRBSIs per 1000 catheter-days between antimicrobial-impregnated and standard CVCs ( RR 0.70 , 95 % CI 0.53-0.91 , p = 0.008). Thirty-three trials were included containing 10,464 patients who received one of four types of CVCs. Compared with a standard catheter , chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine- and antibiotic-coated catheters were associated with lower numbers of CRBSIs per 1000 catheter-days ( ORs and 95 % CrIs: 0.64 ( 0.40-0.955) and 0.53 ( 0.25-0.95) , respectively) and a lower incidence of catheter colonization ( ORs and 95 % CrIs: 0.44 ( 0.34-0.56) and 0.30 ( 0.20-0.46) , respectively). Outcomes are superior for catheters impregnated with chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine or other antibiotics than for standard catheters in preventing CRBSIs and catheter colonization under bundles. Compared with silver ion-impregnated CVCs , chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine antiseptic catheters resulted in fewer cases of microbial colonization of the catheter but did not reduce CRBSIs.
