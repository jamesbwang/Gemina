  2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol ( DAPG)- producing Pseudomonas<pathogen> spp. in the P.<pathogen> fluorescens<pathogen> complex are primarily responsible for a natural suppression of take-all of wheat known as take-all decline ( TAD) in many fields in the USA. P. brassicacearum , the most common DAPG producer found in TAD soils in the Pacific Northwest ( PNW) of the USA , has biocontrol , growth promoting and phytotoxic activities. In this study , we explored how the wheat cultivar affects the level of take-all suppression when grown in a TAD soil , and how cultivars respond to colonization by P. brassicacearum. Three cvs. Tara , Finley and Buchanan supported similar rhizosphere population sizes of P. brassicacearum when grown in a TAD soil , however they developed significantly different amounts of take-all. Cultivars Tara and Buchanan developed the least and most take-all , respectively , and Finley showed an intermediate amount of disease. However , when grown in TAD soil that was pasteurized to eliminate both DAPG producers and take-all suppression , all three cultivars were equally susceptible to take-all. The three cultivars also responded differently to the colonization and phytotoxicity of P. brassicacearum strains Q8r1-96 and L5.1-96 , which are characteristic of DAPG producers in PNW TAD soils. As compared to cv. Tara , cv. Buchanan showed significantly reduced seedling emergence and root growth when colonized by P. brassicacearum , and the response of Finley was intermediate. However , all cultivars emerged equally when treated with a DAPG-deficient mutant of Q8r1-96. Our results indicate that wheat cultivars grown in a TAD soil modulate both the robustness of take-all suppression and the potential phytotoxicity of the antibiotic DAPG.
