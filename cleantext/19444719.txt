  Among all dermatomyositis ( DM) patients , antimelanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 antibody ( anti-MDA5 Ab) positive patients have significantly poor short-term mortality , whereas they experience less relapses over the long term after the remission. We report the case of a patient with anti-MDA5 Ab-positive clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis ( CADM) with the recurrence of interstitial lung disease ( ILD) after 7 years of remission. There has been no case report of an anti-MDA5 Ab-positive DM patient with the recurrence of ILD after 7 years of long-term remission. A 70-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with anti-MDA5 Ab-positive CADM and ILD. After achieving 7 years long-term remission , she was admitted to our department with erythema on the fingers and interstitial pneumonia.<pathogen> Her anti-MDA5 Ab titer was elevated. We diagnosed recurrent CADM complicated with ILD. We successfully treated her with 1,000 mg of methyl-prednisolone pulse and intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy followed by prednisolone 50 mg/day and an increase of cyclosporine. After that treatment , the patient 's skin<pathogen> symptoms<pathogen> and interstitial pneumonia<pathogen> were relieved. All laboratory investigations such as ferritin , the serum markers of interstitial pneumonia<pathogen> ( i.e. , SP-A , SP-D) , and the titer of anti-MDA5 Ab showed signs of improvement. Her case suggests that careful physical examinations and monitoring the serum markers are important even after long-term remission is achieved.
