  Intervertebral disc degeneration ( IVDD) is a chronic<disease> disease<disease> with complicated pathology involving nucleus pulposus ( NP) cell apoptosis and extracellular matrix ( ECM) degradation. Previous studies have shown that moderate autophagy has a protective effect against apoptosis in NP cells. Berberine ( BBR) is an alkaloid compound with many beneficial properties including antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory , antioxidative , and anti-apoptotic activity. Recently , it was found to induce autophagy in various tissues as well. Thus , we hypothesized that BBR may exert a therapeutic effect on IVDD through autophagy activation. In this study , we investigated the effects of BBR on IVDD and delineated a potential mechanism. BBR treatment
