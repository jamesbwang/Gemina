  In frontotemporal dementia ( FTD) , the behavioral variant ( bv-FTD) and nonfluent variant of primary progressive aphasia<symptom> ( nfv-PPA) reflect a prominent neurodegenerative involvement of the frontal lobe networks , which may include the premotor and motor areas and thus cause heterogeneous clinical symptoms including parkinsonism. With the technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation , we investigated long-term potentiation- and long-term depression-like plasticity in the primary motor cortex of bv-FTD and nfv-PPA patients , with and without parkinsonism , by using the theta-burst stimulation ( TBS) protocol. We applied the intermittent TBS and continuous TBS in 20 FTD patients and 18 age-matched healthy subjects. Results were also compared with those achieved in a cohort of age-matched patients with Parkinson 's disease. The responses to TBS were abnormal in FTD patients with parkinsonism. By contrast , the TBS induced normal responses in patients with both nfv-PPA and bv-FTD without parkinsonism. Finally , responses to TBS were comparable in patients with FTD with parkinsonism and patients with Parkinson 's disease. We provide evidence of abnormal primary motor cortex long-term potentiation-/ long-term depression-like plasticity in patients with FTD and parkinsonism suggesting neurodegenerative processes in the corticobasal ganglia-thalamo-cortical motor networks in these patients.
