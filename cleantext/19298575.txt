  This ex vivo study aimed to compare transportation of the mesiobuccal root canal of mandibular first molars instrumented with ProTaper , Race and Sendoline rotary systems using cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT). Forty-five mesiobuccal canals of mandibular first molars were randomly divided into three groups of 15. Root canals in each group were instrumented with the ProTaper , Race or Sendoline rotary system according to the manufacturers ' instructions. Root canal preparations were performed by one operator , while root canal wall measurements were made by another operator blinded to the group allocation of teeth. The pre- and post-chemomechanical preparation CBCT scans were obtained and evaluated at 3 , 6 and 9 mm levels from the apex. The amount of root canal transportation at these levels was calculated. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 17 via Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. No significant difference was noted in canal transportation among the groups ( ProTaper , Race and Sendoline rotary systems are not significantly different in terms of canal transportation. Although all rotary files cause root canal transportation , ProTaper and Race showed the least amount of canal transportation in the coronal and apical thirds , respectively.
