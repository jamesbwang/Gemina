  We argue that the gravitational shock<symptom> wave computation used to extract the scrambling rate in strongly coupled quantum theories with a holographic dual is directly related to probing the system 's hydrodynamic sound<symptom> modes. The information recovered from the shock<symptom> wave can be reconstructed in terms of purely diffusionlike , linearized gravitational waves at the horizon of a single-sided black hole with specific regularity-enforced imaginary values of frequency and momentum. In two-derivative bulk theories , this horizon `` diffusion '' can be related to late-time momentum diffusion via a simple relation , which ceases to hold in higher-derivative theories. We then show that the same values of imaginary frequency and momentum follow from a dispersion relation of a hydrodynamic sound<symptom> mode. The frequency , momentum , and group velocity give the holographic Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity. Moreover , at this special point along the sound dispersion relation curve , the residue of the retarded longitudinal stress-energy tensor two-point function vanishes. This establishes a direct link between a hydrodynamic sound<symptom> mode at an analytically continued , imaginary momentum and the holographic butterfly effect. Furthermore , our results imply that infinitely strongly coupled , large-N _ ( c) holographic theories exhibit properties similar to classical dilute gases; there , late-time equilibration and early-time scrambling are also controlled by the same dynamics.
