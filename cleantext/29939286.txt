  Price discounting is a marketing tactic used frequently by food industries and retailers , but the extent to which education modifies the effect of discounting on the purchasing of unhealthy foods has received little attention. We investigated whether there was a differential association of price discounting of soda with store-level soda purchasing records between 2008 and 2013 by store-neighbourhood education in Montreal , Canada. Using data on grocery purchase transactions from a sample of supermarkets , pharmacies , supercentres and convenience stores , we performed an ecological time-series analysis , modelling weekly store-level sales of soda as a function of store-level price discounting , store- and neighbourhood-level confounders and an interaction term between discounting and categorical education in the neighbourhood of each store. Analysis by store type ( n = 18743 , 12437 , 3965 and 49533 store-weeks for superstores , pharmacies , supercentres and convenience stores , respectively) revealed that the effect measure modification of discounting by neighbourhood education on soda purchasing was lower in stores in the more educated neighbourhoods , most notably in pharmacies: -0.020 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): -0.028 , -0.012) and -0.038 ( 95 % CI: -0.051 , -0.025) , for middle- and high-education categories , respectively). Weaker effect modification was observed in convenience stores. There was no evidence of effect modification in supercentres or superstores. Price discounting is an important environmental risk factor for soda purchasing and can widen education inequalities in excess sugar intake across levels of education. Interventions to regulate price discounting warrant further investigation as a public health strategy to improve population nutrition , particularly in lower-education neighbourhoods.
