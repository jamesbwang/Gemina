  To evaluate the presence of endolymphatic hydrops in patients with immune-mediated inner-ear disease. The presence of endolymphatic hydrops was prospectively evaluated in 17 patients clinically diagnosed with secondary ( n = 5) or primary ( n = 12) immune-mediated inner-ear disease , who attended the ENT department of a tertiary care centre for evaluation or treatment over the previous year. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the temporal bone. Intratympanic gadolinium three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging diagnosed hydrops in 11 of 12 patients with primary immune-mediated inner-ear disease ( 92 per cent). Of these , seven patients ( 64 per cent) presented only cochlear ( n = 5) or predominantly cochlear ( n = 2) hydrops. A positive magnetic resonance imaging result was observed in only one of five patients with secondary immune-mediated inner-ear disease ( 20 per cent). This study confirms the presence of endolymphatic hydrops in immune-mediated inner-ear disease patients. The virtual absence of hydrops in patients with secondary immune-mediated inner-ear disease is remarkable , although firm conclusions can not be drawn; this should be explored in a multicentre study with a larger sample of patients. A different immune reaction without development of endolymphatic hydrops should not be ruled out in secondary immune-mediated inner-ear disease patients.
