  The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term outcomes after intra-atrial re-entrant tachycardia<symptom> ( IART) ablation in congenital heart disease ( CHD). IART increases morbidity and mortality in CHD patients. Radiofrequency catheter ablation has evolved into the first-line treatment of this complication. This was a prospective , single-center study of all consecutive CHD patients who underwent first ablation for IART from January 2009 to December 2015 ( n = 94 , 39.4 % female , age 36.55 ± 14.9 years , follow-up 44.45 ± 22.7 months). During the study period , 130 procedures were performed ( n = 94 , 1.21 ± 0.41 IART/patient). In the first procedure , 114 IART were ablated ( short-term success 74.66 %). Forty-nine percent of the patients whose IART was ablated had non-cavotricuspid isthmus ( CTI)- related IART ( alone or with concomitant CTI IART). After the first ablation , 54.3 % maintained sinus rhythm ( SR) , 23.9 % presented with recurrence of the ablated IART , 14.2 % developed new IART , and 7.6 % presented with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF). After the second radiofrequency catheter ablation , 78.3 % were in SR , 8.7 % presented with AF , and 23.0 % presented with IART ( 50 % new IART). Multivariate predictors of recurrences were non-CTI IART ( hazard ratio ( HR): 5.06; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.6 to 15.9; p = 0.006) , PR interval > 200 ms ( HR: 4.02; 95 % CI: 1.9 to 11.3; p = 0.009) , AF induction ( HR: 3.11; 95 % CI: 1.1 to 9.1; p = 0.04). and previous AF ( HR: 3.08; 95 % CI: 1.1 to 9.3; p = 0.04). A risk score according multivariate model identified 3 levels of recurrence risk: 5.8 % , 20 % , and 58.5 % ( area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 0.8 ± 0.03; p < 0.0001). Ablation of IART in CHD is a challenging procedure , but after ablation in experienced centers , SR can be maintained in 78.3 %. Predictors of recurrences are non-CTI-related IART , long PR interval , and previous or induced AF. A risk score based on these factors can be useful for recurrence prediction.
