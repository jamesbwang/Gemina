  To assess the cardiovascular benefits of protecting against particulate air pollution and noise , we conducted a randomized crossover study with 40 young healthy college students from March to May 2017 in the underground subway , Beijing. Participants each received 4 treatments ( no intervention phase ( NIP) , respirator intervention phase ( RIP) , headphone intervention phase ( HIP) , respirator plus headphone intervention phase ( RHIP)) in a randomized order during 4 different study periods with 2-week washout intervals. We measured personal exposure to particulate matter ( PM) , noise and electrocardiogram ( ECG) parameters ( heart rate variability ( HRV) , heart rate ( HR) and ST segment changes) , ambulatory blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) continuously for 4 hours to investigate the cardiovascular effects. Compared with NIP , most of the HRV parameters increased , especially high frequency ( HF) ( 21.1 % ( 95 % CI: 15.7 % , 26.9 %) , 18.2 % ( 95 % CI: 12.8 % , 23.9 %) , and 35.5 % ( 95 % CI: 29.3 % , 42.0 %) in RIP , HIP , and RHIP , respectively) , whereas ST segment elevation and HR decreased for all 3 modes of interventions. However , no significant differences were observed in BP among the 4 treatments. In summary , short-term wearing of a respirator and/or headphone may be an effective way to minimize cardiovascular risk induced by air pollution in the subway by improving autonomic nervous function.
