  Simulation models quantify the impacts on carbon ( C) and nitrogen ( N) cycling in grassland systems caused by changes in management practices. To support agricultural policies , it is however important to contrast the responses of alternative models , which can differ greatly in their treatment of key processes and in their response to management. We applied eight biogeochemical models at five grassland sites ( in France , New Zealand , Switzerland , United Kingdom and United States) to compare the sensitivity of modelled C and N fluxes to changes in the density of grazing animals ( from 100 % to 50 % of the original livestock densities) , also in combination with decreasing N fertilization levels ( reduced to zero from the initial levels). Simulated multi-model median values indicated that input reduction would lead to an increase in the C sink strength ( negative net ecosystem C exchange) in intensive grazing systems: -64 Â± 74 g C m
