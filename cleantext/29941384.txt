  Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , an opportunistic pathogen is able to invade into and persist inside non-professional phagocytic cells. To do so , this bacterium<pathogen> possesses a wide range of secreted virulence factors which enable attachment to the host as well as intracellular survival. Hence , a monitoring of virulence factors specifically produced upon internalization might reveal targets for prevention or therapy of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> infections. However , previous proteome approaches enriching S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> from lysed host cells after infection did not cover secreted virulence factors. Therefore , we used density gradient centrifugation and mass spectrometry to identify S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> HG001 proteins which were secreted into compartments of infected human bronchial epithelial S9 cells. Because shotgun mass spectrometry revealed only few bacterial proteins amongst 1905 host proteins , we used highly sensitive and selective single reaction monitoring mass spectrometry as an alternative approach and quantified 37 bacterial proteins within the S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> containing host cell compartment 2.5 h and 6.5 h post infection. Among them were secreted bacterial virulence factors like lipases , pore forming toxins , and secreted adhesins which are usually hard to detect from infected sample material by proteomics approaches due to their low abundance. S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> adapted its proteome to improve its response to oxidative and cell wall stress occurring inside the host , but also , increased the amounts of some adhesins and pore-forming toxins , required for attachment and host cell lysis.
