  The UL69 protein from human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV) is a multifunctional regulatory protein and a member of the ICP27 protein family conserved throughout herpesviruses. UL69 plays many roles during productive infection , including the regulation of viral gene expression , nuclear export of intronless viral RNAs , and control of host cell cycle progression. Throughout the ICP27 protein family , an ability to self-associate is correlated with the functions of these proteins in transactivating certain viral genes. Here , we determined the domain boundaries of a globular ICP27 homology domain of UL69 , which mediates self-association , and characterized the oligomeric state of the isolated domain. Size exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering ( SEC-MALS) revealed that residues 200 to 540 form a stable homo-tetramer , whereas a shorter region comprising residues 248 to 536 forms a homo-dimer. Structural analysis of the UL69 tetramer by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) revealed a dimer-of-dimers three-dimensional envelope with bridge features likely from a region of the protein unique to betaherpesviruses. The data provide a structural template for tetramerization and improve our understanding of the structural diversity and features necessary for self-association within UL69 and the ICP27 family.
