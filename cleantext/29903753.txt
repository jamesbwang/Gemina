  Paracetamol , on its own or in combination with other analgesics , is widely used to treat pain associated with acute and chronic conditions. It is considered safe enough to have a general sales licence ( GSL) for use by `` adults , elderly and children over 16 years '' and has few listed cautions or contraindications .1,2 However , recently the effectiveness and safety of paracetamol for some conditions have been challenged , 3,4 and there are published case reports of liver failure associated with therapeutic doses.5-9 Here , we review the use of paracetamol , its pharmacokinetics , the mechanisms by which it can cause liver damage and consider whether frail older people are at greater risk of adverse effects. We also discuss if dose reduction should be considered in some circumstances.
