  There are critical gaps in our understanding of the temporal relationships between metabolites and subsequent asthma development. This is the first study to examine metabolites from newborn screening in the etiology of early childhood wheezing. One thousand nine hundred and fifty one infants enrolled between 2012 and 2014 from pediatric practices located in Middle Tennessee in the population-based birth cohort study , the Infant Susceptibility to Pulmonary<disease> Infections<disease> and Asthma Following RSV Exposure Study ( INSPIRE) , were linked with metabolite data from the Tennessee Newborn Screening Program. The association between the levels of 37 metabolites and the number of wheezing episodes in the past 12 months was assessed at 1 , 2 , and 3 years of life. Several metabolites were significantly associated with the number of wheezing episodes. Two acylcarnitines , C10: 1 and C18: 2 , showed robust associations. Increasing levels of C10: 1 were associated with increasing number of wheezing episodes at 2 years ( OR 2.11 , 95 % CI 1.41-3.17) and 3 years ( OR 2.56 , 95 % CI 1.59-4.11) , while increasing levels of C18: 2 were associated with increasing number of wheezing episodes at 1 year ( OR 1.38 , 95 % CI 1.12-1.71) and 2 years ( OR 1.47 , 95 % CI 1.17-1.84). Identification of specific metabolites and associated pathways involved in wheezing pathogenesis offer insights into potential targets to prevent childhood asthma morbidity.
