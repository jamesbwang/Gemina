  In this work , energy transfers reciprocally between Mn2 + and Eu2 + ions in nitride SrAlSi4N7 have been found and investigated in detailed. In contrast to Mn2 + and Eu2 + activated oxide based phosphors , the red light centering at 608 nm is ascribed to 4f-5d transitions of Eu2 + ions and Mn2 + activated SrAlSi4N7 emits a cyan light peaked at 500 nm. Additionally , the special broad excitation band of SrAlSi4N7: Mn2 + centering at 362 nm has been covered by that of Eu2 + ions ranging from 300 to 550 nm. The overlap of energy level of Mn2 + and Eu2 + ions creates the condition for the energy transferring reciprocally between Eu2 + and Mn2 + ions. A series of SrAlSi4N7: 0.002 Mn2 + , xEu2 + ( 0 ≤ x ≤ 005) with tunable emission light have been synthesized and the decay curves of samples prove the happening of the energy transfer between Mn2 + and Eu2 + ions reciprocally. This mode of energy transfer not only prevents the loss of energy , but also improves the thermal stability and the intensity of SrAlSi4N7: Mn2 + , Eu2 + at 150 °C is still beyond 92 % of the initial intensity. The results provide a new mode of energy transfer , which is expected to improve the drawback existing in energy transfer.
