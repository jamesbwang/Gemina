  Intestinal helminths , along with mutualistic microbes , have cohabited the intestine of mammals throughout evolution. Interactions between helminths , bacteria , and their mammalian hosts may shape not only host-helminth and host-microbiome interactions , but also the relationship between helminths and the microbiome. This ` ménage à trois ' situation may not be completely balanced in that it may favor either the host or the parasite , possibly at the cost of the other partner. Similarly , helminths may favor the establishment of a particular microbiome with either positive or negative consequences for the overall health and well-being of the host. Recent studies indicate that infection with intestinal helminths can and does impact the intestinal microbiome , with important consequences for each partner in this tripartite relationship.
