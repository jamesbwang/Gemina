  There has been a recent recognition of the need to prepare PhD-trained scientists for increasingly diverse careers in academia , industry , and health care. The PhD Data Task Force was formed to better understand the current state of PhD scientists in the clinical laboratory workforce and collect up-to-date information on the training and certification of these laboratorians. In this report , we summarize the findings of the PhD Data Task Force and discuss the relevance of the data collected to the future supply of and demand for PhD clinical laboratory scientists. It is clear that there are multiple career opportunities for PhD scientists in academic medical centers , commercial clinical laboratories , biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies , and the federal government. Certified PhD scientists have and will continue to form an important resource for our technologically advancing field , bringing training in scientific methods , and technologies needed for modern laboratory medicine. The data gathered by the PhD Data Task Force will be of great interest to current and future PhD candidates and graduate PhD scientists as they make decisions regarding future career directions.
