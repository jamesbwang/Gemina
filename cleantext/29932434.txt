  Centriolar satellites ( CS) are small proteinaceous granules that cluster around the centrosome and serve as cargo vehicles for centrosomal proteins. It is generally accepted that CS support a number of canonical and specialized centrosome functions. Consequently , these highly dynamic structures are the target of regulation by several cellular signalling pathways. Two decades of research have led to the identification of a large number of molecular components and new biological roles of CS. Here , we summarize the latest advances in the continuous efforts to uncover the compositional , functional , dynamic and regulatory aspects of CS. We also report on our discovery that osmotic stress conditions render CS immobile and insensitive to remodelling. Upon a range of p38-activating stimuli , MK2 phosphorylates the CS component CEP131 , resulting in 14-3-3 binding and a block to CS formation. This normally manifests as a rapid cellular depletion of satellites. In the case of osmotic stress , a potent inducer of p38 activity , CS translocation and dissolution is blocked , with the net result that satellites persist in an immobile state directly adjacent to the centrosome. Our results highlight a unique scenario where p38 activation and CS depletion is uncoupled , with potential implications for physiological and pathological osmotic stress responses.
