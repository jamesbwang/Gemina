  Prostate artery embolisation ( PAE) is a new minimally invasive treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> ( BPH). The purpose of this study was to review the efficacy and safety of PAE in the treatment of BPH with LUTS. A systematic review performed according to the PRISMA guidelines with a pre-specified search strategy for PubMed , Web of Science , Cochrane Library and Embase databases protocol ( PROSPERO ID: CRD42017059196). Trials studying the efficacy of prostate artery embolisation to treat LUTS with more than ten participants and follow-up longer than 6 months were included by two independent authors. Outcomes investigated were International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS) , quality of life ( QoL) , International Index of Erectile Function ( IIEF-5) , prostate volume ( PV) , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) , peak void flow ( Qmax) , post-void residual ( PVR) and complications. To summarise mean change from baseline , a meta-analysis was done using the random-effects model. The search returned 210 references , of which 13 studies met the inclusion criteria , representing 1,254 patients. Patients in the included studies with data available for meta-analysis had moderate to severe LUTS and a mean IPSS of 23.5. Statistically significant ( p value < 0.05) improvements of all investigated outcomes were seen at 12-month follow-up. Major complications were reported in 0.3 % of the cases. Our findings suggest that PAE can reduce moderate to severe LUTS in men with BPH with a low risk of complications. • Prostate artery embolisation ( PAE) improved International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS) by 67 %. • Major complications after PAE are very rare. • Use of cone-beam CT may reduce risk of non-target embolisation.
