  To determine whether hs-CRP level and interval change of hs-CRP could predict the development of metabolic abnormalities in healthy subjects in a longitudinal study. A cohort of 3748 male who had normal hs-CRP level without evidence of any component of metabolic syndrome<disease> were studied. At each visit , hs-CRP level and metabolic abnormalities were measured. Interval change of hs-CRP for each subject was calculated. COX proportional hazard model and logistic regression analysis were used. Cumulative incidence and incidence density of metabolic syndrome<disease> were 3.96 % and 7.17 per 1000 person-year , respectively. Cumulative incidence of metabolic syndrome<disease> was significantly increased according to hs-CRP tertile level. This significance remained after adjusting age , smoking , drinking , and exercise. Although the hazard ratio of metabolic syndrome<disease> for incidence density was increased significantly as hs-CRP increased , such trend disappeared after adjusting for confounding variables. The risk of metabolic syndrome<disease> was significantly higher ( 1.48 times) in the hs-CRP increased group than that in the decreased or unchanged group. This significance remained after controlling for covariates. Relatively higher hs-CRP level within normal range may predict the increase of metabolic syndrome<disease> compared to lower hs-CRP. Increased hs-CRP level may increase the incidence of metabolic
