  Two new phenolic glycoside compounds ( 1 , 2) and ten known analogues ( 3-12) have been isolated from the ethanolic extract of Brassica rapa flowers and identified as 2-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl- ( 1S)- ( 4-methoxyphenyl) ethylene glycol ( 1) , 2- ( 4-O-β-d-allopyranosyl) phenyl-ethanol ( 2) , 2-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl- ( 1S)- phenylethylene glycol ( 3) , 2-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl- ( 1R)- phenylethylene glycol ( 4) , ( Z)- p-coumaryl-O-β-d-glucopyranoside ( 5) , phenyl-O-β-d-glucopyranoside ( 6) , 2-phenylethyl-O-β-d-glucopyranoside ( 7) , salidroside ( 8) , 2- ( 2-hydroxyphenyl) ethanol-O-β-d-glucopyranoside ( 9) , 4-methoxybenzyl-O-β-d-glucopyranoside ( 10) , 2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl-1-O-β-d-glucopyranoside ( 11) and sachaliside 1 ( 12). The structures of 1 and 2 , including absolute configurations , were determined by spectroscopic data (
