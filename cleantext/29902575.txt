  A clinical pathway ( CP) defines a standardized care process for a well-defined patient group that aims to improve patient outcomes and promote patient safety. However , the construction of a new pathway from scratch is a time-consuming task for medical staff because it involves many factors , including objects , multidisciplinary collaboration , sequential design , and outcome measurements. Recently , the rapid development of hospital information systems has allowed the storage of large volumes of electronic medical records ( EMRs) , and this information constitutes an abundant data resource for building CPs using data-mining methods. We provide an automatic method for extracting typical treatment processes from EMRs that consists of four key steps. First , a novel similarity method is proposed to measure the similarity of two treatment records. Then , we perform an affinity propagation ( AP) clustering algorithm to cluster doctor order set sequences ( DOSSs). Next , a framework is proposed to extract a high-level description of each treatment cluster. Finally , we evaluate the extracted typical treatment processes by matching the treatment cluster with external information , such as the treatment efficacy , length of stay , and treatment cost. By experiments on EMRs of 8287 cerebral infarction patients , it is concluded that our proposed method can effectively extract typical treatment processes from treatment records , and also has great potential to improve treatment outcome by personalizing the treatment process for patients with different conditions. The extracted typical treatment processes are intuitive and can provide managerial guidance for CP redesign and optimization. In addition , our work can assist clinicians in clearly understanding their routine treatment processes and recommend optimal treatment pathways for patients.
