  Recent studies have shown that Aurora-A expression is associated with bladder cancer initiation and progression. In this study , the effects of intravesical Aurora-A inhibitor Alisertib ( ALS) and bacillus<pathogen> Calmette-Gu√©rin ( BCG) were compared on bladder carcinogenesis. Two mg N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea was administered intravesically to forty of Wistar-albino rats every other week for 8 weeks. At week 10 , rats were divided into four groups ( 10/group): No-treatment ( vehicle) , ALS-alone , BCG-alone , and ALS + BCG. The intravesical treatment of ALS , BCG , and ALS plus BCG was performed once a week for 6 weeks. At week 16 , bladders were collected for immunohistopathological and Western blot analysis. The cell cycle regulators p53 , p21 , Aurora-A , phosphorylated Aurora-A ( p-Aurora-A) , and apoptotic marker cleavage of poly ( ADP-ribose) polymerase ( c-PARP) were determined by Western blot. Histopathologically relatively healthy urothelium was observed in ALS + BCG group ( 87.5 %) compared to the ALS-alone ( 50 %) and the BCG-alone ( 50 %) groups. The lowest expression of p21 and p53 was detected in the BCG-alone , while the highest level of expression was evident in no-treatment group. The ALS treatment alone caused a slight decrease in Aurora-A while there was a dramatic decrease in p-Aurora-A in comparison to no-treatment group. In overall combined treatment with ALS + BCG significantly increased c-PARP compared to all mono-treatments , and decreased all cell cycle parameters compared to no-treatment group. Although intravesical ALS treatment has similar antiproliferative effects like BCG , ALS + BCG combined treatment led to a best histopathologic and apoptotic response. Consequently , BCG combined with Aurora-A inhibition may provide a new intravesical treatment modality in the prevention of bladder carcinogenesis.
