  To evaluate the influence of dentofacial attractiveness using the ` Psychosocial Impact of Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire ' ( PIDAQ) , Satisfaction with Life Scale ( SWLS) and Aesthetic Component ( AC) of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need ( IOTN) in patients with cleft lip/palate ( CLP) , and non-cleft orthodontic patients ( Non-CLP) and their parents. Eighty patients ( aged 11-19 years) comprising 40 CLP and 40 non-CLP were administered the PIDAQ and SWLS questionnaires to be rated individually by the patients , along with IOTN-AC rated by the patients and their parents , respectively. The subjects were also sub-divided according to their age , i.e. pre-adolescent and adolescent. The PIDAQ subpart scores for aesthetic concern differed between the two groups , with a significantly ( P < 0.02) lower scoring for the CLP group. The adolescent CLP group scored more negatively than the pre-adolescent group in the dental self-confidence and social impact sub-parts of PIDAQ. No significant differences were observed for satisfaction with life. The parents ' IOTN-AC score for both groups was significant ( P < 0.05) greater than the patient 's score , especially for adolescent subjects. Non-condition specific questionnaires with restrictive sampling sizing and non-inclusion of parameters like stress coping mechanism etc.. The parents rated the malocclusion of their child more critically than the child itself. A majority of the CLP group had a problem in identifying themselves using the IOTN-AC as no photo existed depicting a Class III or edge-to-edge malocclusion. Attitudes , especially perceptions of the aesthetics of front teeth , are crucial factors influencing patient 's psychological self-concept , social confidence , and treatment need in CLP patients and non-CLP patients , having more relevance as the patient matures towards adolescence and adulthood.
