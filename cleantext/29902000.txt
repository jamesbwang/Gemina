  Herein , we report a fairly simple and environmentally friendly approach for the fabrication of starch-based magnetic polymer beads ( SMPBs) with uniform shape and size through spontaneous rearrangement of short-chain glucan ( SCG) produced by enzymatic debranching of waxy maize starch. The paramagnetic materials , dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles ( Dex@IONPs) , were readily incorporated into the starch microstructure and rendered a superparamagnetic property to the SMPBs. The morphology and size of resulting SMPBs turned out to be modulated by Dex@IONPs in a concentration-dependent manner , of which Dex@IONPs was assumed to be acting as a seed inducing the epitaxial crystallization of SCG and further transforming it into homogeneous microparticles. The surface of SMPBs was readily functionalized with an antibody through a one-step reaction using a linker protein. The immuno-SMPBs showed great capture efficiency ( > 90 %) for target bacteria. The colloidal stability and favorable surface environment for biomolecules are believed to be responsible for the high capture efficiency and specificity of the SMPBs. Furthermore , the captured bacteria along with antibody and linker protein were effectively eluted from the surface of SMPBs by adding free maltose , making this new material suitable for various chromatographic applications.
