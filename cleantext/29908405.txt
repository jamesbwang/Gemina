  To identify pre-operative clinical and computerized spiral analysis characteristics that may help ascertain which patients with Essential Tremor<symptom> ( ET) will exhibit ` early tolerance ' to ventral intermediate nucleus of thalamus ( Vim) deep brain stimulation ( DBS). Identification of comparative characteristics of defined cases of ` early tolerance ' versus patients with sustained satisfactory response treated with Vim DBS surgery for medically-refractory ET , based on retrospective chart review by a clinician blinded to the findings of computerized spiral analysis. Statistically significant differences in two spiral analysis indices , SWVI and DoS , were found in the dominant upper limbs of patients who developed ` early tolerance ' , whereas the clinical characteristics were not significantly different. Objective measurements of upper limb kinematics using graphonomic tests like spiral analysis should be considered in the pre-operative evaluation for DBS , especially in the setting of moderate-severe predominantly action and proximal postural tremors<symptom>. Ours is the first investigation looking into the pre-operative clinical and objective physiologic characteristics of the patients who develop ` early tolerance ' to Vim DBS for the treatment of essential tremor<symptom>. The study has significant implications for pre-operative evaluation and potential surgical target selection for the treatment of
