  P-glycoprotein ( Pgp) determines resistance to a broad spectrum of drugs used against glioblastoma multiforme<pathogen> ( GB). Indeed , Pgp is highly expressed in GB stem cells and in the brain-blood barrier ( BBB) , the peculiar endothelium surrounding the brain. Inhibiting Pgp activity in the BBB and GB is still an open challenge. Here , we tested the efficacy of a small library of tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives with an EC
