  We aimed to identify the carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria ( GNB) causing catheter-related bloodstream infections ( CRBSI) in intensive care units ( ICU) in a tertiary care Egyptian hospital , to study their resistance mechanisms by phenotypic and genetic tests , and to use ERIC-PCR for assessing their relatedness. The study was conducted over 2 years in three ICUs in a tertiary care hospital in Egypt during 2015-2016. We identified 194 bloodstream infections ( BSIs); 130 ( 67.01 %) were caused by GNB , of which 57 were isolated from CRBSI patients ( 73.84 %). Identification of isolates was performed using conventional methods and MALDI-TOF MS. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing ( AST) was done by disc diffusion following CLSI guidelines. Phenotypic detection of carbapenemases enzymes activity was by modified Hodge test and the Carba-NP method. Isolates were investigated for the most common carbapenemases encoding genes bla
