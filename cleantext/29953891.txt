  G-quadruplex ( G4) structures are known to be promising anticancer drug targets and flavonols ( an important class of flavonoids) are small molecules reported to possess several health-promoting properties including those of anticancer activities. In this work , we explored the interactions of the structurally related plant flavonols kaempferol ( KAE; 3,5,7,4 ` OH flavone) and morin ( MOR; 3,5,7,2 ' ,4 ` OH flavone) with various G4-DNA sequences along with duplex DNA using a combination of spectroscopic and molecular docking studies. Our results revealed that KAE shows preferential interaction with VEGF G4-DNA in comparison to the other G4 sequences and duplex DNA. Moreover , KAE enhances the thermal stability of VEGF G4-DNA. In contrast , MOR exhibits an appreciably weaker level of interaction with both duplex and various G4-DNAs , with no significant structural specificity. The contrasting DNA binding behaviors suggest a crucial role of the 2 ` OH substituent in the B-ring of flavonol moiety. While KAE is relatively planar , MOR adopts a significantly non-planar conformation attributable to steric hindrance from the additional 2 ` OH substituent. This small structural difference is apparently very important for the ability of KAE and MOR to interact with VEGF G4-DNA. Thus , KAE ( but not MOR) appears to be an effective ligand for VEGF G4-DNA , opening up possibilities of its application for regulation of gene expression in cancer cells.
