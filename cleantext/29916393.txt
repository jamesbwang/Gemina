  Dactylogyrus ctenopharyngodonid and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis are 2 important ectoparasites of fish. Both parasites can induce an immune response in fish that leads to a decrease in parasitic infection intensity and the development of resistance against parasitic reinfection. The present study evaluated whether grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella that survived a D. ctenopharyngodonid infection could develop immunity against infection by D. ctenopharyngodonid and I. multifiliis. The results demonstrated that when grass carp were infected with D. ctenopharyngodonid , the number of red blood cells and the percentages of thrombocytes , monocytes , and neutrophils in the white blood cells increased significantly in the early stage of infection. The percentage of lymphocytes increased over time following parasitic infection. The mean infection intensity of D. ctenopharyngodonid decreased to 0 on Day 28. The activities of serum acid phosphatase , alkaline phosphatase , lysozyme , and superoxide dismutase increased significantly after D. ctenopharyngodonid infection. In addition , the grass carp that survived a previous D. ctenopharyngodonid infection could completely resist D. ctenopharyngodonid reinfection and partially resist I. multifiliis infection.
