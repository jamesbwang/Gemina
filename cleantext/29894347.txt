  We report a case of profound coagulopathy after the dual insult of cold in-situ perfusion of the liver and cardiopulmonary bypass in a patient undergoing complex hepatobiliary and cardiovascular surgery. Management of this coagulopathy with conventional blood products was hindered by elevated venous pressures , thought to contribute to persistent bleeding and risked liver and right ventricular dysfunction , necessitating a change in strategy. Anesthesiologists should consider fluid-restrictive strategies to correct coagulopathy in combined liver and cardiac surgery.
