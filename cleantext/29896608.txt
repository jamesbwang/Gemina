  Understanding the intermolecular interactions in the context of crystal packing is of fundamental significance in molecular materials science. Infrared ( IR) spectroscopy can provide complementary structural information; however , it still remains a great challenge to accurately predict the molecular IR vibrations in the crystalline phase. Here we report a cluster-model approach to simulate the IR spectra of triazine-based molecular crystals via density functional theory ( DFT) calculations. In the properly designed cluster models , the molecular IR vibrations are expressed by a representative unit , while the nearest-neighbouring molecules are treated as a `` frozen shell '' to mimic the surrounding crystallographic environments. Much smaller clusters can be built by considering the crystallographic equivalence in the unit cell , which are able to perform DFT calculations on more complicated crystal structures with endurable computational costs. The simulated spectra show excellent consistencies with the experimental ones , particularly providing an in-depth understanding of the vibrational modes closely related to hydrogen bonding. Most importantly , the selectively built clusters based on the crystallographically independent molecules in the unit cell allow us to perform specific IR-spectral simulations , by which their distinct hydrogen-bonding environments have been clearly revealed for the first time.
