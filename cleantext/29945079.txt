  Quantitative chemical analyses of 428 organic contaminants ( OCs) indicated the presence of 313 OCs in the sediment extracts from Sava River , Croatia. Pharmaceuticals were present in higher concentrations than pesticides thus confirming their increasing threat to freshwater ecosystems. Toxicity evaluation of the sediment extracts from four locations ( Jesenice , Rugvica , Galdovo and Lukavec) using zebrafish embryotoxicity test ( ZET) accompanied with semi-quantitative histopathological analyses exhibited correlation with cumulative number and concentrations of OCs at the investigated sites ( 10.05 , 15.22 , 1.25 , and 9.13 Î¼g/g respectively). Toxicity of sediment extracts and sediment was predicted using toxic unit ( TU) approach and persistence , bioaccumulation and toxicity ( PBT) ranking. Additionally , influential OCs and genes were identified by graph mining of the prior knowledge informed , site-specific chemical-gene interaction models. Predicted toxicity of sediment extracts ( TU
