  The diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis ( MS) has continuously evolved , allowing for an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of MS over time. The McDonald Criteria for diagnosis of MS were originally proposed in 2001 , with previous revisions in both 2005 and 2010. The International Panel on Diagnosis in MS have recently reviewed the 2010 McDonald Criteria , and made recommendations for the revised 2017 McDonald Criteria. Any revisions made relied entirely on the available evidence , and not expert opinion. In this review , we provide an overview of the recent 2017 revisions to the McDonald Criteria , focusing in particular on the motivating evidence behind the recommendations made. We also review the existing research around misdiagnosis in MS , as well as areas considered to be high priorities of research , currently lacking in sufficient evidence , which may influence future diagnostic criteria in years to come. Finally , we illustrate some clinical examples , to demonstrate the impact of new diagnostic criteria on time to MS diagnosis in a real-world setting.
