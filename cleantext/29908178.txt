  Although colonoscopy is the criterion standard for detection of colorectal adenomas , some adenomas are missed. Full-spectrum endoscopy ( FUSE) allows for observation with a 330 ° angle of view , which is expected to decrease the miss rate. However , no consensus has been reached regarding the superiority of FUSE over standard forward-viewing colonoscopy ( SFVC) for detection of adenomas; we therefore compared new-generation FUSE and SFVC regarding colorectal adenoma miss rate ( AMR) in this , the first reported randomized control trial using new-generation FUSE. We enrolled individuals aged 40-75 years who had been referred for screening , surveillance , fecal occult blood test positivity , or symptoms in a prospective randomized trial of tandem colonoscopy in eight institutions. Patients were randomly assigned ( 1:1) via computer-generated stratified randomization. Neither the endoscopists nor patients were blinded to the allocation. The primary endpoint was AMR per patient ( AMR-PP). We enrolled 345 patients and included 319 in the per-protocol analyses. AMR-PP was significantly lower with FUSE ( 11.7 %; 95 % CI , 8.0 % -15.4 %) than with SFVC ( 22.9 %; 95 % CI , 17.5 % -28.3 %; P < 0.001). AMR-PP for lesions<symptom> ≤ 5 mm in size was significantly lower with FUSE ( 10.4 %; 95 % CI , 6.5 % -14.3 %) than SFVC ( 20.0 %; 95 % CI , 14.4 % -25.6 %; P = 0.0057). Furthermore , AMR-PP in the ascending colon was significantly lower with FUSE ( 4.3 %; 95 % CI , 1.4 % -7.2 %) than with SFVC ( 10.6 %; 95 % CI , 6.1 % -15.1 %; P = 0.0212). FUSE is superior to SFVC regarding both AMR-PP and AMR; additionally , AMR-PP were both significantly lower with FUSE than SFVC for lesions<symptom> ≤ 5 mm in size and in the ascending colon.
