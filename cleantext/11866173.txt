  Emerging inflammatory response biomarkers are developed to predict the survival of patients with cancer , the aim of our study is to establish an inflammation-related nomogram based on the classical predictive biomarkers to predict the survivals of patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). Nine hundred and fifty-two NSCLC patients with lung cancer surgery performed were enrolled into this study. The cutoffs of inflammatory response biomarkers were determined by Receiver operating curve ( ROC). Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to select independent prognostic factors to develop the nomogram. The median follow-up time was 40.0 months ( range , 1 to 92 months). The neutrophil to lymphocyte<symptom> ratio ( cut-off: 3.10 , HR: 1.648 , P = 0.045) was selected to establish the nomogram which could predict the 5-year OS probability. The C-index of nomogram was 0.72 and the 5-year OS calibration curve displayed an optimal agreement between the actual observed outcomes and the predictive results. Neutrophil to lymphocyte<symptom> ratio was shown to be a valuable biomarker for predicting survival of patients with NSCLC. The addition of neutrophil to lymphocyte<symptom> ratio could improve the accuracy and predictability of the nomogram in order to provide reference for clinicians to assess patient outcomes.
