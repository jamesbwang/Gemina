  Lipid metabolism is vital to fetal development and cardiometabolic health and the final weeks of gestation are known to be a time of intense metabolic activity. New techniques such as lipidomics allow investigation of a complex lipidomic profile in infants. This research aimed to ( 1) describe variations in lipidomic profile in late preterm and term infants and ( 2) compare variations to an adult lipidomic profile with known clinical implications. The Barwon Infant Study ( n = 1,074) is a population-derived pre-birth cohort study. The lipidomic profile of cord blood was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in 225 participants and the association between gestational age and lipidomic profile was investigated using multiple linear regression adjusting for birth weight , exposure to labour , and infant sex. Patterns of association with gestational age across the lipidomic profile were compared with associations between body mass index ( BMI) and lipidomic profile observed among adults in the San Antonia Family Heart Study ( n = 994). Gestational age was independently associated with the abundances of 39 % of lipid species. Variations in the lipidomic profile with increasing gestational age were comparable to some variations observed in association with increasing BMI among adults. There is a strong relationship between gestational age and the cord blood lipid profile at birth , providing further evidence for the importance of metabolic changes of late gestation. A number of the variations in the lipid profile with increasing gestational age are analogous to differences observed in the adult lipid profile with an increasing BMI.
