  Left main trunk ( LMT) occlusion is a rare angiographic finding. The primary purpose was to investigate the ECG pattern of patients with angiographic confirmation of LMT as culprit lesion<symptom>. Forty-eight patients ( 32 men; mean age 73 years) with angiographic total ( 21 patients; 44 %) or subtotal ( 27 patients; 56 %) occlusion of the LMT were analyzed. Twenty patients ( 42 %) were found to have concomitant coronary lesions<symptom>. Eighteen patients ( 38 %) required intra-aortic balloon pump support. A significant left axis deviation was observed in 26 cases ( 54 %) and an intraventricular conduction delay in 32 patients ( 67 %). The average QRS width and QTc interval were 122 and 433 ms , respectively. ST-segment elevation in lead aVR occurred in 32 patients ( 67 %). ST-segment elevation in leads V2-5 and in leads I and aVL ( classic left anterior descending ( LAD) type) was frequently observed ( 18 cases; 35 %). In six patients ( 13 %) , a partial LAD type was observed with ST-segment elevation in leads I and aVL , but not in peripheral leads. The remaining patients showed ST-segment elevation only in peripheral leads ( 12 cases) , in inferior leads III + aVF ( six cases) , whereas six patients had no ST-segment elevation. Diffuse ST-segment depression<symptom> only ( > 6 leads) was observed in 15 cases ( 31 %). Eighteen patients ( 38 %) died during hospitalization. ST-segment elevation in lead aVR or a LAD-type pattern can be associated with LMT disease. Other relevant aspects are the presence of cardiogenic shock<symptom> at admission , the left axis deviation and marked prolongation of QTc interval and QRS width.
