  Patients with hypertension tend to have a lower health-related quality of life ( HRQOL) compared to normotensive patients. This study 's main objectives are to assess ( 1) HRQOL and factors that might impact it and ( 2) association between HRQOL and adherence to treatment , trust in physician , and treatment satisfaction among patients with hypertension. A cross-sectional study enrolled 196 patients from medical-care offices in Beirut , North and South Lebanon. Eligible patients signed a consent form and were asked to complete the Trust in Physician Scale , World Health Organization Quality of Life-brief ( WHOQOL-brief) questionnaire , and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire ( TSQM 1.4) as well as questions assessing medication adherence. Better antihypertensive medication adherence was significantly and positively correlated with better HRQOL domains except general health where significance was not reached ( P = .089). Better adherence was also significantly related to better treatment satisfaction ( side effects , convenience , and global satisfaction but not to effectiveness) and an increased trust in physicians ( P < .0001). Better treatment satisfaction ( TSQM domains) was significantly and positively associated with a better overall HRQOL ( P â‰¤ .001). Increased trust in physician scores were significantly and positively correlated with a better psychological health , environment , and overall HRQOL domains ( P = .045 , .005 , and .006 , respectively). Finally , TSQM effectiveness , convenience , and global satisfaction were significantly higher when trust in physician was greater ( P = .017 , .035 , and .002 , respectively). The results of this study revealed an association between increased adherence to treatment , a higher global satisfaction , and an increased quality of life. An increased patient satisfaction with their antihypertensive treatment and trust in their physician were also correlated with a greater adherence to treatment.
