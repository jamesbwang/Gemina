  Organic anion transporter ( OAT) 2 and OAT7 were recently shown to be involved in the hepatic uptake of drugs; however , there is limited understanding of the population variability in the expression of these transporters in liver. There is also a need to derive relative expression-based scaling factors ( REFs) that can be used to bridge in vitro functional data to the in vivo drug disposition. To this end , we quantified OAT2 and OAT7 surrogate peptide abundance in a large number of human liver tissue samples ( n = 52) , as well as several single-donor cryopreserved human hepatocyte lots ( n = 30) by a novel , validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS) method. The average surrogate peptide expression of OAT2 and OAT7 in the liver samples was 1.52 ± 0.57 and 4.63 ± 1.58 fmol/μg membrane protein , respectively. While we noted statistically significant differences ( p < 0.05) in hepatocyte and liver tissue abundances for both OAT2 and OAT7 , the differences were relatively small ( 1.8- and 1.5-fold difference in median values , respectively). Large interindividual variability was noted in the hepatic expression of OAT2 ( 16-fold in liver tissue and 23-fold in hepatocytes). OAT7 , on the other hand , showed less interindividual variability ( 4-fold) in the livers , but high variability for the hepatocyte lots ( 27-fold). A significant positive correlation in OAT2 and OAT7 expression was observed , but expression levels were neither associated with age nor sex. In conclusion , our data suggest marked interindividual variability in the hepatic expression of OAT2/7 , which may contribute to the pharmacokinetic variability of their substrates. Because both transporters were less abundant in hepatocytes than livers , a REF-based approach is recommended when scaling in vitro hepatocyte transport data to predict hepatic drug clearance and liver exposure of OAT2/7 substrates.
