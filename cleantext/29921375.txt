  miR-145 is highly expressed in vascular cells , where it regulates phenotypic switching and vascular homeostasis , but its role in carotid artery stenosis ( CAS) is controversial. In the present study , the expression of miR-145 was assessed by real time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) in human samples ( both plasma and/or endarterectomy samples) from patients with symptomatic CAS and in controls without CAS. The mouse carotid artery ligation ( CAL) model was used to determine the role of miR-145 on vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo ( VSMCs) by using a mimic of or an inhibitor of miR-145. We found that miR-145 expression was significantly reduced in the plasma and plaque from patients with CAS ( p less than 0.01). The expression of miR-145 in the mouse CAL model , as assessed by qRT-PCR , was significantly reduced compared to the carotid arteries of the control group ( p less than 0.01). In vitro , enhancement or inhibition of miR-145 in VSMCs demonstrated that miR-145 significantly inhibited proliferation of VSMCs ( p less than 0.05); in vivo , enhancement of miR-145 significantly inhibited neointimal formation in the CAL model ( p less than 0.01). These results demonstrate that the expression of miR-145 is reduced in human CAS , miR-145 plays a critical role in CAS by modulation of VSMC proliferation , suggesting that MiR-145 may present a potential therapeutic option for treating CAS.
