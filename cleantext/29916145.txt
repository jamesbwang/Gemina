  Our previous report on hippocampal proteome analysis suggested the involvement of voltage-dependent anion channel ( Vdac) 1 in scopolamine-induced amnesia. Further silencing of Vdac1 in young mice reduced the recognition memory. Vdac1 is a porin protein present abundantly on outer mitochondrial membrane. It acts as a transporter of energy metabolites ATP/ADP and Ca
