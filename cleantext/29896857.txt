  Accurate diagnosis of invasive mold diseases ( IMD) remains challenging. Here , the performance of panfungal PCR , Aspergillus<pathogen> and MucoralesPCR in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL) was evaluated. We conducted a single-center study including 167 hematologic patients at risk for IMD with BAL performed 2011-2014. Diagnostic performance of single tests ( Aspergillus<pathogen>- , Mucorales- , and panfungal PCR , galactomannan ( GM) ≥ 0.5 and ≥ 1 , culture/cytology) or in combination was calculated for predicting IMD comparing proven/probable or proven/probable/possible IMD vs no IMD , respectively. IMD was classified as proven ( n = 6) , probable ( n = 31) , possible ( n = 29) and no IMD ( n = 101) according to EORTC/MSG criteria. GM ≥ 0.5 in BAL showed the highest sensitivity with 81 % for diagnosing IMD whereas the other tests only 5 % -35 %. By contrast , specificity was highest for panfungal PCR with 99 % and GM ≥ 1 , Mucorales and AspergillusPCR reached specificity ≥ 91 %. When combining the tests , GM ≥ 0.5 and panfungal PCR show a sensitivity and specificity of 87 % and 78 % for IMD or with AspergillusPCR a sensitivity and specificity of 88 % and 72 % for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis , respectively. Including possible IMD patients did not improve the sensitivity of PCRs. In probable/proven IMD patients , the addition of panfungal PCR resulted further in detection of Fusarium<pathogen> species and Alternaria species , and the MucoralesPCR was positive in 2 probable IMD cases. This study illustrates that the diagnosis of IMD is still very problematic and lacks objectivity. Together with GM in BAL , the PCRs may prove an addition to the current available diagnostic armamentarium in IMD because of their ability to identify molds on a species level.
