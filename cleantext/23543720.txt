  Lantibiotics continue to offer an untapped pipeline for the development of novel antibiotics. We report here the discovery of a novel lantibiotic for the treatment of C difficile infection ( CDI). The leads were selected from a library of over 300 multiple substitution variants of the lantibiotic Mutacin 1140 ( MU1140). Top performers were selected based on testing for superior potency , solubility , manufacturability , and physicochemical and/or metabolic stability in biologically-relevant systems. The best performers in vitro were further evaluated orally in the Golden Syrian hamster model of CDAD. In vivo testing ultimately identified OG716 as the lead compound , which conferred 100 % survival and no relapse at 3 weeks post infection. MU1140-derived variants are particularly attractive for further clinical development considering their novel mechanism of action.
