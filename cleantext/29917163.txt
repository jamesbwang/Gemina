  The objective of this study is trying to solve water pollution problems related to duck house wastewater by developing a novel duck house wastewater treatment technology. A pilot-scale sequencing batch reactor ( SBR) system using different hydraulic retention times ( HRTs) for treating duck house wastewater was developed and applied in this study. Experimental results showed that removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand in untreated duck house wastewater was 98.4 , 98.4 , 87.8 , and 72.5 % for the different HRTs of 5 , 3 , 1 , and 0.5 d , respectively. In addition , removal efficiency of biochemical oxygen demand in untreated duck house wastewater was 99.6 , 99.3 , 90.4 , and 58.0 % , respectively. The pilot-scale SBR system was effective and deemed capable to be applied to treat duck house wastewater. It is feasible to apply an automatic SBR system on site based on the previous case study of the farm-scale automatic SBR systems for piggery wastewater treatment.
