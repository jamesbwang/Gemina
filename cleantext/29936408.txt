  Psychological stability and brain integration are important factors related to physical and mental health and organization effectiveness. This study tested whether a mind-body technique , the Transcendental Meditation ( TM) program could increase EEG brain integration and positive affect , and decrease psychological distress in government employees. Ninety-six central office administrators and staff at the San Francisco Unified School District were randomly assigned to either immediate start of the TM program or to a wait-list control group. At baseline and four-month posttest , participants completed an online version of the Profile of Mood States questionnaire ( POMS). In addition , a subset of this population ( N = 79) had their EEG recorded at baseline and at four-month posttest to calculate Brain Integration Scale ( BIS) scores. At posttest , TM participants significantly decreased on the POMS Total Mood Disturbance and anxiety<symptom> , anger , depression<symptom> , fatigue<symptom> , and confusion<symptom> subscales , and significantly increased in the POMS vigor subscale. TM participants in the EEG-subgroup also significantly increased in BIS scores. Compliance with meditation practice was high ( 93 %). Findings indicate the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing the TM program to improve brain integration and positive affect and reduce psychological distress in government administrators and staff.
