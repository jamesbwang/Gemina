  Central place foragers ( CPF) rest within a central place , and theory predicts that distance of patches from this central place sets the outer limits of the foraging arena. Many marine ectothermic predators behave like CPF animals , but never stop swimming , suggesting that predators will incur ` travelling ' costs while resting. Currently , it is unknown how these CPF predators behave or how modulation of behavior contributes to daily energy budgets. We combine acoustic telemetry , multi-sensor loggers , and hidden Markov models ( HMMs) to generate ` activity seascapes ' , which combine space use with patterns of activity , for reef sharks ( blacktip reef and grey reef sharks) at an unfished Pacific atoll. Sharks of both species occupied a central place during the day within deeper , cooler water where they were less active , and became more active over a larger area at night in shallower water. However , video cameras on two grey reef sharks revealed foraging attempts/success occurring throughout the day , and that multiple sharks were refuging in common areas. A simple bioenergetics model for grey reef sharks predicted that diel changes in energy expenditure are primarily driven by changes in swim speed and not body temperature. We provide a new method for simultaneously visualizing diel space use and behavior in marine predators , which does not require the simultaneous measure of both from each animal. We show that blacktip and grey reef sharks behave as CPFs , with diel changes in activity , horizontal and vertical space use. However , aspects of their foraging behavior may differ from other predictions of traditional CPF models. In particular , for species that never stop swimming , patch foraging times may be unrelated to patch travel distance.
