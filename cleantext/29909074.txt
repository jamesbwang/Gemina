  Risks associated with drug therapy and surgical ligation have led health care providers to consider alternative strategies for patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA) closure. Catheter-based PDA closure is the procedure of choice for ductal closure in adults , children , and infants â‰¥ 6 kg. Given evidence among older counterparts , interest in catheter-based closure of the PDA in lower weight ( < 6 kg) infants is growing. Among these smaller infants , the goals of this review are to: ( 1) provide an overview of the procedure; ( 2) review the types of PDA closure devices; ( 3) review the technical success ( feasibility); ( 4) review the risks ( safety profile); ( 5) discuss the quality of evidence on procedural efficacy; ( 6) consider areas for future research. The review provided herein suggests that catheter-based PDA closure is technically feasible , but the lack of comparative trials precludes determination of the optimal strategy for ductal closure in this subgroup of infants.
