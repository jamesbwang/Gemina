  Chaperones play a pivotal role in protein homeostasis , but with age their ability to clear aggregated and damaged protein from cells declines. Tau pathology is a driver of a variety of neurodegenerative disease and in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) it appears to be precipitated by the formation of amyloid-β ( Aβ) aggregates. Aβ-peptide appears to trigger Tau hyperphosphorylation , formation of neurofibrillary tangles and neurotoxicity. Recently , dihydropyridine derivatives were shown to upregulate the heat shock<symptom> response ( HSR) and provide a neuroprotective effect in an APPxPS1 AD mouse model. The HSR response was only seen in diseased cells and consequently these compounds were defined as co-inducers since they upregulate chaperones and co-chaperones only when a pathological state is present. We show for compounds tested herein , that they target predominantly the C-terminal domain of Hsp90 , but show some requirement for its middle-domain , and that binding stimulates the chaperones ATPase activity. We identify the site for LA1011 binding and confirm its identification by mutagenesis. We conclude , that binding compromises Hsp90 's ability to chaperone , by modulating its ATPase activity , which consequently induces the HSR in diseased cells. Collectively , this represents the mechanism by which the normalization of neurofibrillary tangles , preservation of neurons , reduced tau pathology , reduced amyloid plaque , and increased dendritic spine density in the APPxPS1 Alzheimer 's mouse model is initiated. Such dihydropyridine derivatives therefore represent potential pharmaceutical candidates for the therapy of neurodegenerative disease , such as AD.
