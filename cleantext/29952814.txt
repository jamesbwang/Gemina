  The association between metabolic activity and functional coupling of the posterior cingulate cortex ( PCC) in cirrhotic patients remains undefined. Therefore , this study aimed to assess the association of functional coupling with metabolic patterns of PCC in resting cirrhotic patients. Twenty-six cirrhotic patients , including 10 with hepatic encephalopathy ( HE) and 16 without HE , were assessed , alongside 21 control participants. Single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS) of the PCC and resting-state functional MRI ( rs-fMRI) were performed on a 3.0-T MR scanner. The ratios of all metabolites to creatine ( Cr) and rs-fMRI parameters ( including amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation ( ALFF) , node degree ( Ki) , and betweenness centrality ( Bi)) were evaluated by analysis of variance. Associations of metabolite ratios with rs-fMRI parameters and venous ammonia<pathogen> were determined by Pearson 's correlation analysis. Lower chlorine ( Cho)/ Cr ( 0.6 ± 0.2 vs. 0.9 ± 0.1 , P < 0.001) and higher ALFF ( 1.3 ± 0.5 vs. 1.1 ± 0.3 , P = 0.01) were found in cirrhotic patients in comparison with controls. In cirrhotic patients , the ALFF values correlated negatively with Cho/Cr ( r = -0.397 , P = 0.044). Meanwhile , Bi values showed positive associations with glutamine + glutamate/Cr ( r = 0.500 , P = 0.009) and N-acetyl aspartate/Cr ( r = 0.581 , P = 0.006). In the HE subgroup , Ki correlated positively with Cho/Cr ( r = 0.867 , P = 0.001). In cirrhotic patients without HE , Bi values showed a high positive correlation with glutamate + glutamine/Cr ( r = 0.690 , P = 0.013). These findings suggest a close association between metabolic activity and functional coupling of the PCC in cirrhotic patients , especially those with HE , whose node degree of the PCC shows an overt positive correlation with Cho/Cr.
