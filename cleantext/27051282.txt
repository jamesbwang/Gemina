  The safety , lung function efficacy , and symptomatic benefits of combined tiotropium and olodaterol in patients with COPD were established in the 1-year TONADO These were 2 replicate , randomized , double-blind , parallel-group , 52-week Phase III studies that assessed tiotropium/olodaterol compared with tiotropium or olodaterol alone ( all via Respimat Of 3,041 patients included in this analysis , 1,333 ( 43.8 %) had mild , 404 ( 13.3 %) had moderate , and 5 ( 0.2 %) had severe renal impairment; these were distributed equally between treatment groups. Almost one-quarter of all treated patients ( 23.4 %) had a history of cardiac disorder , 45.6 % had hypertension , and 13.3 % had glucose metabolism disorders , including diabetes. AEs with olodaterol , tiotropium , and tiotropium/olodaterol occurred in 75.1 % , 70.8 % , and 72.0 % of patients with no renal impairment , 75.7 % , 74.0 % , and 73.3 % with mild renal impairment , and 84.3 % , 79.5 % , and 79.7 % with moderate renal impairment , respectively. There was no notable effect of renal impairment on the proportion of patients with an AE , and no differences were observed between tiotropium/olodaterol versus the monocomponents. There was no difference in the incidence of major adverse cardiac events , renal and urinary tract AEs , or potential anticholinergic effects with increasing severity of renal impairment. Over half the patients enrolled in the TONADO studies had renal impairment , and there was a high level of pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidity. The safety and tolerability of tiotropium/olodaterol is comparable to the monocomponents , irrespective of the level of renal impairment.
