  CeO2-supported Ru ( Ru/CeO2) worked as an effective and reusable heterogeneous catalyst for the selective dissociation of the C-N bond in amides , particularly primary amides , with H2 in water solvent at low reaction temperature of 333 K , and high yields of the corresponding alcohols were obtained from primary amides.
