  The aim of this study was to evaluate the hearing benefit , advantages , and disadvantages in a series of patients using a new , nonimplantable , pressure-free , adhesive bone conduction hearing aid. Twelve patients were included in the study at the ear , nose , and throat<symptom> department of the Medical University of Vienna. All patients suffered from conductive hearing loss for at least 3 months. A sound field audiometry , Freiburg monosyllables word test and Oldenburg sentence test were carried out. Additionally , sound quality ( SSQ12) and quality of life ( AQoL-8D) were assessed using questionnaires. Analysis revealed an average aided threshold of 30.8 dB HL ( ± 7.1 SD) and an unaided threshold of 45.1 dB HL ( ± 7.0 SD) , resulting in a statistically significant ( p < 0.001) average functional gain. Additionally , participants experienced about 30 % gain in word recognition scores at 65 dB sound pressure level , speech reception threshold in quiet was 56.8 dB ( ± 6.1) and improved to 44.5 dB ( ± 6.4) in the aided condition. Both , the SSQ12 and the AQoL-8D showed a statistically significant improvement when comparing the scores at the beginning of the study to the answers after 2 weeks of device usage ( SSQ12 ( p < 0.002) and AQoL-8D ( p = 0.002)). Neither skin irritations nor pain were reported during the study period. In conclusion , this new , adhesive bone conduction hearing aid has a high patient satisfaction rate while causing no skin irritation or pain.
