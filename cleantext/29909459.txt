  The treatment of some inborn metabolism errors requires cholesterol substitution therapy. Cholesterol plays a vital role in the human body. Therefore , the majority of cholesterol determination techniques are targeted to blood and blood serum. Nevertheless , cholesterol determination in food is important as well. In this paper , cholesterol determination using differential pulse voltammetry ( DPV) in dairy products ( e.g. , milk , clotted cream , yogurt , butter , etc.) is reported with a novel nonenzymatic sensor based on diphosphonic acid of 1,4-diacetylglycoluril ( DPADGU) as an electrode surface modifier. Stable anodic response was obtained from cholesterol on the modified carbon-based electrode. The sensor has high stability , sensitivity ( 20 Î¼A mol L
