  Recovery-oriented mental health care requires active involvement of service users in the evaluation of care. While experience of care surveys is routinely given out upon discharge , capturing the depth and detail of service users ' experiences in such a way to meaningfully improve services may require more in-depth and targeted approaches. This study aimed to gather voluntary and involuntary service users ' experiences of care during hospitalization in two acute adult mental health inpatient units , through the collaborative completion of a purpose designed tool. The purpose of the study was to examine broad experiences of care and to identify the utility of proactive approaches to ongoing service evaluation. Overall , 67 participants were interviewed. Findings highlight the complexity of experiences of care including how an admission can seemingly facilitate clinical recovery while not being recovery-oriented. The findings also detail areas for improvement in the way that care is delivered and evaluated. The implications are particularly pertinent for mental health nurses to consider how , within the existing constraints of their roles , they can provide therapeutic care to all service users.
