  Neurotransplantation may be a promising approach for therapy of cerebellar diseases characterized by a substantial loss of neurons. Neurotransplantation could rescue neurons from degeneration and maintain cerebellar reserve , facilitate cerebellar compensation , or help reconstruct damaged neural circuits by cell substitution. These mechanisms of action can be of varying importance according to the type of cerebellar disease. Neurotransplantation therapy in cerebellar ataxias<symptom> is still at the stage of experimental studies. There is currently little knowledge regarding cerebellar patients. Nevertheless , data provided by experiments in animal models of cerebellar degeneration and both clinical studies and experiences in patients with other neurologic diseases enable us to suggest basic principles , expectations , limitations , and future directions of neurotransplantation therapy for cerebellar diseases.
