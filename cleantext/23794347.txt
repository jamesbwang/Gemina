  The gold-standard for diagnosis is growth of To assess the role of EUS-FNA in the diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis<disease> in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Consecutive patients with peritoneal thickening , ascites and decompensated cirrhosis underwent EUS-FNA from the thickened omentum. Presence of granuloma<disease> or demonstration of acid fast bacilli was diagnostic of peritoneal tuberculosis<disease> A total of 5 patients with CLD underwent EUS-FNA from omentum. FNA cytology revealed granuloma<disease> with multinucleated cells in all patients ( 100 %) and AFB stain was positive in 2 of them ( 40 %). We hereby report the use of EUS guided fine needle aspiration ( FNA) of peritoneum as a newer , safe and unexplored technique for diagnosis of peritoneal TB.
