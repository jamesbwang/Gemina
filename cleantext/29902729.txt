  Studies on synthesis , physico-chemical and biological properties of novel biomimetic materials , potentially useful as injectable hydrogels are presented. These materials are in situ prepared chemically crosslinked collagen/chitosan/hyaluronic acid-based hydrogels exhibiting potential for tissue regeneration. Optimization of hydrogels involved testing the effect of various concentration of crosslinking agent ( genipin) as well as different ratios of biopolymers used on their properties. The changes in the content of hyaluronic acid and in the genipin concentration used have been shown to be crucial. Employing the highest concentration of crosslinking agent studied ( 20 mM) the hydrogels of compact structure , characterized by good mechanical properties and prolonged degradation profile can be obtained. Changing the HA content in sol mixture the hydrogel of various wettability; more or less hydrophilic when compared to pure collagen/chitosan hydrogels can be fabricated. The in vitro cell culture study has shown that the surface of the prepared materials ensures suitable biocompatibility. These hydrogels can support the proliferation and adhesion of MG-63 cell line as it was demonstrated using Alamar Blue assay and SEM observations. It is believed that the collagen/chitosan/hyaluronic acid hydrogels crosslinked with genipin are particularly promising materials for bone regeneration procedures , especially attractive for regeneration of small bone losses. This is the first paper in the litearature presenting results of studies on that type of biopolymeric injectable hydrogels chemically crosslinked with genipin.
