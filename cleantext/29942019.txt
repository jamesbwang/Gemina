  It is unclear why sexually reproducing isogamous species frequently contain just two self-incompatible mating types. Deterministic theory suggests that since rare novel mating types experience a selective advantage ( by virtue of their many potential partners) , the number of mating types should consistently grow. However , in nature , species with thousands of mating types are exceedingly rare. Several competing theories for the predominance of species with two mating types exist , yet they lack an explanation for how many are possible and in which species to expect high numbers. Here , we present a theoretical null model that explains the distribution of mating type numbers using just three biological parameters: mutation rate , population size and the rate of sex. If the number of mating types results from a mutation-extinction balance<symptom> , the rate of sexual reproduction plays a crucial role. If sex is facultative and rare ( a very common combination in isogamous species) , mating type diversity will remain low. In this rare sex regime , small fitness differences between the mating types lead to more frequent extinctions , further lowering mating type diversity. We also show that the empirical literature supports the role of drift and facultativeness of sex as a determinant of mating type dynamics.
