  The distribution of human leucocyte antigen ( HLA) allele and haplotype varied among different ethnic populations. In this study , we investigated the allele and haplotype frequencies of HLA-A , HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 loci in the Nanning Han population who live in Guangxi province of China. We identified 26 HLA-A , 56 HLA-B and 31 HLA-DRB1 alleles in 562 Nanning individuals of Han ethnic group by sequence-based typing method. Of these , the three most common alleles in HLA-A , HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 loci , respectively , were A * 11:01 ( 32.12 %) , A * 02:07 ( 12.54 %) , A * 24:02 ( 12.01 %); B * 46:01 ( 14.41 %) , B * 15:02 ( 13.61 %) , B * 40:01 ( 11.48 %); DRB1 * 15:01 ( 14.15 %) , DRB1 * 16:02 ( 11.57 %) and DRB1 * 12:02 ( 10.14 %). With the exception of HLA-DRB1 , the p values of the HLA-A and HLA-B loci showed that the HLA allelic distribution in this population was in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg expectation ( p > 0.05). A total of 173 HLA ~ A-B ~ DRB1 haplotype with a frequency of > 0.1 % were presented and the three most common haplotype were HLA-A * 33:03 ~ B * 58:01 ~ DRB1 * 03:01 ( 6.12 %) , HLA-A * 11:01 ~ B * 15:02 ~ DRB1 * 12:02 ( 3.39 %) and HLA-A * 11:01 ~ B * 15:02 ~ DRB1 * 15:01 ( 3.22 %). The phylogenetic tree and the principal component analysis suggested that Nanning Han population had a relative close genetic relationship with Chinese Zhuang population and a relative distant genetic relationship with Northern Han Chinese. The information will be useful for anthropological studies , for HLA matching in transplantation and disease association studies in the Chinese population.
