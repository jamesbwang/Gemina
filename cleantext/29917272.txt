  Exfoliated carbon nanofibers ( ExCNFs) are expected to serve as excellent scaffolds for promoting and guiding bone-tissue regeneration. We aimed to enhance the effects of ExCNFs using bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs) and examined their feasibility and safety in clinical applications using a rat spinal fusion model. Group I ( n = 15) animals were implanted with the control carrier; Group II ( n = 16) animals were implanted with carrier containing 1 μg ExCNFs; Group III ( n = 16) animals were implanted with carrier containing 1 μg recombinant human ( rh) BMP-2; and Group IV ( n = 17) animals were implanted with carrier containing 1 μg rhBMP-2 and 1 μg ExCNFs. The rats were euthanized after 4 or 8 weeks and their spines were explanted and assessed by manual palpation , radiographs , and high-resolution microcomputerized tomography ( micro-CT); the spines were also subjected to histological analysis. The fusion rates in Group IV ( 25.0 %: 4-week , 45.5 %: 8-week) were considerably higher than in Groups I ( 0 %: 4-week , 0 %: 8-week) , II ( 0 %: 4-week , 15.0 %: 8-week) , and III ( 16.7 %: 4-week , 30.0 %: 8-week). These results demonstrated the enhancement of ExCNF bone fusion effects by BMP in a rat spinal fusion model. Our results suggest that the enhancement of ExCNFs effects by BMP makes this combination a possible attractive therapy for spinal fusion surgeries. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.
