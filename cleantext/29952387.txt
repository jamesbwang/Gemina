  Well-defined core-shell structured coaxial sulfur/polypyrrole tubular nanocomposites , polypyrrole nanotubes wrapped by uniform rough sulfur layers , were fabricated as Li-S battery cathodes via a facile one-pot method. In the designed structure , the polypyrrole backbone can facilitate the charge transport and also restrain the soluble polysulfide diffusion , while the active sulfur layer can efficiently react with Li + assisted by the PPy nanotubes , and the lithium polysulfides can be massively trapped by the PPy nanotubes during charge-discharge processes. The as-prepared coaxial sulfur/polypyrrole tubular nanocomposites with a sulfur loading of 53.3 % exhibited a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1117 mA h g-1 with a remarkable cycling stability , retaining 692 mA h g-1 and 525 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.2 C and 1C , respectively. Moreover , they expressed an excellent rate capability performance , maintaining 470 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 2C.
