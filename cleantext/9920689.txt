  Oro-sensory exposure ( OSE) to food plays an important role in the regulation of food intake. One proposed underlying mechanism is the occurrence of cephalic phase responses ( CPRs). CPRs include the pre-digestive endocrine responses induced by food-related sensory input. Yet , whether OSE duration or sweetness intensity affects CPRs is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the independent and interactive effects of oro-sensory duration ( chewing) and stimulation intensity ( sweetness) on endocrine CPRs and satiation.
