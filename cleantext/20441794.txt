  Previous work from our group demonstrated the use of multiple input atlases to a modified multi-atlas framework ( MAGeT-Brain) to improve subject-based segmentation accuracy. Currently , segmentation of the striatum<pathogen> , globus pallidus and thalamus are generated from a single high-resolution and- contrast MRI atlas derived from annotated serial histological sections. Here , we warp this atlas to five high-resolution MRI templates to create five de novo atlases. The overall goal of this work is to use these newly warped atlases as input to MAGeT-Brain in an effort to consolidate and improve the workflow presented in previous manuscripts from our group , allowing for simultaneous multi-structure segmentation. The work presented details the methodology used for the creation of the atlases using a technique previously proposed , where atlas labels are modified to mimic the intensity and contrast profile of MRI to facilitate atlas-to-template nonlinear transformation estimation. Dice 's Kappa metric was used to demonstrate high quality registration and segmentation accuracy of the atlases. The final atlases are available at https://github.com/CobraLab/atlases/tree/master/5-atlas-subcortical.
