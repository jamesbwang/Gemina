  The volatile profiles of three blackcurrant ( Ribes nigrum L.) cultivars grown in Finland and their responses to growth latitude and weather conditions were studied over an 8 year period by headspace solid-phase microextraction ( HS-SPME) followed by gas-chromatographic-mass-spectrometric ( GC-MS) analysis. Monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes were the major classes of volatiles. The cultivar ` Melalahti ' presented lower contents of volatiles compared with ` Ola ' and ` Mortti ' , which showed very similar compositions. Higher contents of volatiles were found in berries cultivated at the higher latitude ( 66 ° 34 ' N) than in those from the southern location ( 60 ° 23 ' N). Among the meteorological variables , radiation and temperature during the last month before harvest were negatively linked with the volatile content. Storage time had a negative impact on the amount of blackcurrant volatiles.
