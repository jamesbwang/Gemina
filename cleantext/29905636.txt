  To describe a new classification system of thyroid eye disease ( TED) based on the phenotypic features ( clinical and radiologic) of the disease. Clinical features , photographic , and orbital imaging of TED patients were considered in relation to their natural history and treatment response in the experience of the author. Phenotypically distinct categories of patients were identified and described. Six phenotypes of TED are observed: 1) congestive ( active inflammatory) , 2) `` white eye '' expansion , 3) `` hydraulic '' apex , 4) `` white eye '' apex , 5) cicatricial active , and 6) cicatricial passive. The observable characteristics of TED are determined by the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. TED is heterogeneous in its underlying pathogenesis , clinical manifestations , and response to medical and surgical treatment modalities. Several previous categorizations of the clinical appearance of TED exist , but they are dichotomous and underrepresent the heterogeneity of the disease. The authors present clinical and radiologic features of 6 different classes or phenotypes of TED and their response to different treatments.
