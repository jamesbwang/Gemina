  Isoliquiritigenin ( ISL) is a flavonoid , that has been shown to have antioxidant , vasorelaxant , anti-inï¬‚ammatory , and antitumor activities. This study aimed to explore the antitumor effect of ISL on human osteosarcoma U2OS cells and investigate the mechanism of this effect. The effect of ISL on osteosarcoma U2OS cell proliferation , invasion , migration , and apoptosis were determined by a CCK8 assay , a transwell invasion assay , a transwell migration assay , and fluorescence-activated cell sorting , respectively. In addition , the protein expression levels of Bcl2 , Bax , active Caspase-3 , Akt , mTOR , p70 , and Cyclin D1 were detected by western blotting. ISL suppressed cell proliferation , inhibited invasion and migration , and promoted apoptosis in U2OS cells. After treatment with ISL , the protein expression levels of Bax and active Caspase-3 increased , while the level of Bcl-2 declined significantly. Furthermore , the phosphorylation levels of Akt and mTOR declined significantly compared with that of the control. ISL could retard proliferation and promote apoptosis of U2OS cells possibly by suppressing the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway , indicating that it might be a potential therapeutic agent for osteosarcoma treatment.
