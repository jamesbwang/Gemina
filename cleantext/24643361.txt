  Quantitative approaches to analyze the large data sets generated by single molecule localization super-resolution microscopy ( SMLM) are limited. We developed a computational pipeline and applied it to analyzing 3D point clouds of SMLM localizations ( event lists) of the caveolar coat protein , caveolin-1 ( Cav1) , in prostate cancer cells differentially expressing CAVIN1 ( also known as PTRF) , that is also required for caveolae formation. High degree ( strongly-interacting) points were removed by an iterative blink merging algorithm and Cav1 network properties were compared with randomly generated networks to retain a sub-network of geometric structures ( or blobs). Machine-learning based classification extracted 28 quantitative features describing the size , shape , topology and network characteristics of âˆ¼ 80,000 blobs. Unsupervised clustering identified small S1A scaffolds corresponding to SDS-resistant Cav1 oligomers , as yet undescribed larger hemi-spherical S2 scaffolds and , only in CAVIN1-expressing cells , spherical , hollow caveolae. Multi-threshold modularity analysis suggests that S1A scaffolds interact to form larger scaffolds and that S1A dimers group together , in the presence of CAVIN1 , to form the caveolae coat.
