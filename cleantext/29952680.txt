  Boron and boron nitride nanotubes ( BNNTs) are increasingly used in different industrial fields and , potentially , in some biomedical areas. As occurs with other nanomaterials ( NMs) , to increase our knowledge on their potential health hazards is a priority. Although in vitro approaches are a routine in getting biological information on the biological effects of NMs , the use of simple in vivo model organisms is receiving an increased interest. In this context , Drosophila melanogaster is widely used as a eukaryotic model for the study of the potential harmful effects associated with various agents , including NMs. The aim of this study is to provide new data on the potential antioxidant/antigenotoxic properties of boron and boron nitride nanotubes ( BNNTs) , as well as on other biological end-points. Our results show changes in the expression of genes involved in the antioxidant defense ( CAT and SOD) , and in those rel0061ted to the integrity of the intestinal barrier ( Duox , Hml , Muc68D , and PPO2) , at the highest exposure doses ( 5 , 10 mM). However , non-relevant toxic or genotoxic effects were observed. Interestingly , BNNTs and boron significantly reduced the genotoxic effect of potassium dichromate ( PDC) , and the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS). This suggest that the observed effects can be linked to the antioxidant properties of BNNTs and boron. This is the first study reporting antigenotoxicity/genotoxicity , and gene expression data , in the somatic cells of D. melanogaster larvae for BNNTs.
