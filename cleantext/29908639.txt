  Hydatidiform mole ( HM) is an aberrant human pregnancy with abnormal trophoblastic development , migration/invasion of the extravillous trophoblast in the decidua. These abnormalities are established in a hypoxic environment during the first trimester of gestation. Using text mining , we identified 72 unique genes that are linked to HM ( HM-linked genes) that we studied by bioinformatic analysis in publicly available transcriptomes of primary chorionic villous cells ( cytotrophoblast , syncytiotrophoblast , extravillous trophoblast , and arterial and venous endothelial) isolated from normal placentas or established trophoblastic cell lines cultured under different oxygen concentrations. We show that the majority of HM-linked genes ( 75 %) are involved in normal trophoblastic differentiation , arranged in clusters , and some of them are implicated in chorionic villous invasion or regulated by oxygen concentrations. Our analysis integrates the various aspects of the pathophysiology of HM and highlights the importance of trophoblastic differentiation in this pathology.
