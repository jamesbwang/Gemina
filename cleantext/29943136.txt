  While minimally invasive approaches are increasingly being utilized for pancreatoduodenectomy ( PD) , factors associated with prolonged operative time ( OpTime) and hospital length of stay ( LOS) remain poorly defined , and it is unclear whether these factors are consistent across surgical approaches. The ACS-NSQIP targeted pancreatectomy database from 2014 to 2016 was used to identify all patients who underwent open ( OPD) , laparoscopic ( LPD) , or robotic ( RPD) pancreatoduodenectomy. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to evaluate predictors of OpTime and LOS , as well as quantify the changes observed relative to each surgical approach. Among 10,970 patients , PD procedure types varied: 9963 ( 92 %) open , 418 ( 4 %) laparoscopic , and 409 ( 4 %) robotic. LOS was longer for the open and laparoscopic approaches ( 11 vs. 11 vs. 10 days , P = 0.0068) , whereas OpTime was shortest for OPD ( 366 vs. 426 vs. 435 min , P < 0.0001). Independent predictors of a prolonged OpTime were ASA class ≥ 3 ( P = 0.0002) , preoperative XRT ( P < 0.0001) , pancreatic duct < 3 mm ( P = 0.0001) , T stage ≥ 3 ( P = 0.0108) , and vascular resection ( P < 0.0001) for OPD; T stage ≥ 3 ( P = 0.0510) and vascular resection ( P = 0.0062) for LPD; and malignancy ( P = 0.0460) and conversion to laparotomy ( P = 0.0001) for RPD. Independent predictors of increased LOS were age ≥ 65 years ( P = 0.0002) , ASA class ≥ 3 ( P = 0.0012) , hypoalbuminemia ( P < 0.0001) , and preoperative blood transfusion ( P < 0.0001) for OPD as well as an OpTime > 370 min ( all p < 0.05) and specific postoperative complications ( all p < 0.05) for all surgical approaches. Perioperative risk factors for prolonged OpTime and hospital LOS are relatively consistent across open , laparoscopic , and robotic approaches to PD. Particular attention to these factors may help identify opportunities to improve perioperative quality , enhance patient satisfaction , and ensure an efficient allocation of hospital resources.
