  BACKGROUND There is a great need for a quality of sexual life questionnaire ( QVS) in breast cancer survivors ( BCSs) based on the Chinese social culture since the imported tools lack localization verification. To develop a QVS in BCSs and determine its validity and reliability. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the qualitative study , a total of 21 BCSs were interviewed by purposive sampling and snowball sampling; and in the quantitative study , a total of 249 BCSs , who were admitted and received outpatient follow-up , were investigated. Regarding construct validity , factor analysis was performed. The female sexual function index ( FSFI) , self-rating depression<symptom> scale ( SDS) , and Locke-Wallace marital adjustment test ( LWMAT) were used to evaluate criterion validity. Cronbach 's alpha coefficient was used as an index of internal consistency. To evaluate test-retest reliability , 50 patients were re-evaluated after 1 week. RESULTS We put 28 items in the factor analysis model: ( 1) 5 factors were extracted by exploratory factor analysis ( EFA) , with a cumulative contribution of 60.37 %; ( 2) the confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA) showed that the path coefficients among the factors were all above 0.5 , and the standardized load coefficients of the most items were above 0.5; ( 3) the Cronbach 's alpha coefficient was 0.929 for the overall questionnaire , and ranged from 0.571 to 0.869 for the 5 factors; ( 4) the correlation coefficients between the overall questionnaire and the FSFI , SDS , and LWMAT were 0.582 , -0.456 and 0.515 , respectively ( P < 0.01); and ( 5) the test-retest correlation coefficient was 0.816 , and the split-half-reliability coefficient was 0.899. CONCLUSIONS The QVS in BCSs has good reliability and validity , and can be used to assess the quality of sexual life among BCSs in Mainland China.
