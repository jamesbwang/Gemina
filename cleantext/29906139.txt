  In this Letter , we take the first step towards construction of nontrivial Lagrangian theories of higher-spin gravity in a metriclike formulation in three dimensions. The crucial feature of a metriclike formulation is that it is known how to incorporate matter interactions into the description. We derive a complete classification of cubic interactions for arbitrary triples s _ ( 1) , s _ ( 2) , s _ ( 3) of massless fields , which are the building blocks of any interacting theory with massless higher spins. We find that there is , at most , one vertex for any given triple of spins in 3D ( with one exception , s _ ( 1) = s _ ( 2) = s _ ( 3) = 1 , which allows for two vertices). Remarkably , there are no vertices for spin values that do not respect strict triangle inequalities and contain at least two spins greater than one. This translates into selection rules for three-point functions of higher-spin conserved currents in two dimensional conformal field theory. Furthermore , universal coupling to gravity for any spin is derived. Last , we argue that this classification persists in arbitrary Einstein backgrounds.
