  To map the production of knowledge on vascular access complications in patients undergoing percutaneous procedures in hemodynamic laboratories. Scoping review study. The search strategy was developed in three stages , considering the period from July 2005 to July 2015 in the PubMed , CINAHL , Scopus , and LILACS databases. The collected data were analyzed and summarized in a narrative form. One-hundred twenty-eight publications that made it possible to map the contexts of study of complications , occurrence according to access routes , as well as an understanding of diagnosis and clinical management , were included. Three theme categories were identified: complications; predictive factors; and diagnosis/treatment. Vascular access site complications range according to the access route used.
