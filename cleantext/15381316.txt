  Positron emission tomography ( PET) is a non-invasive imaging technique used to assess various brain functions , including cerebral blood flow , glucose metabolism , and neurotransmission , in the living human brain. In particular , neurotransmission mediated by the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine , serotonin , and norepinephrine , has been extensively examined using PET probes , which specifically bind to the monoamine receptors and transporters. This useful tool has revealed the pathophysiology of various psychiatric disorders , including schizophrenia , and the mechanisms of action of psychotropic drugs. Because monoamines are implicated in various cognitive processes such as memory and executive functions , some PET studies have directly investigated the associations between monoamine neurotransmission and cognitive functions in healthy individuals and patients with psychiatric disorders. In this mini<pathogen> review , I discuss the findings of PET studies that investigated monoamine neurotransmission under resting conditions , specifically focusing on cognitive functions in patients with schizophrenia. With regard to the dopaminergic system , some studies have examined the association of dopamine D1 and D2/D3 receptors , dopamine transporters , and dopamine synthesis capacity with various cognitive functions in schizophrenia. With regard to the serotonergic system , 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors have been studied in the context of cognitive functions in schizophrenia. Although relatively few PET studies have examined cognitive functions in patients with psychiatric disorders , these approaches can provide useful information on enhancing cognitive functions by administering drugs that modulate monoamine transmission. Moreover , another paradigm of techniques such as those exploring the release of neurotransmitters and further development of radiotracers for novel targets are warranted.
