  Greece has experienced a double challenge of being under austerity for the past decade and also facing an influx of refugees and migrants ( R&M s) , mostly fleeing war zones. The purpose of this case study is to report on a shelter camp in Greece. An ethnographic case study technique was used. Data were collected via interviews , personal observations , and field notes. Analytic themes based on the coded data and personal memo writing were created. The sample consisted of the shelter camps ' living social reality. Analysis revealed five thematic categories: ground rules , makeshift layout , food and drinks , children , and nursing perspectives. These were subsequently collated into a coherent `` story '' about routine daily life in the shelter camp. As camp facilities had been hastily erected , the services were basic and life was harsh. The need to provide better facilities including social and psychological support for R&M s is evident for this particular host facility. In Greece , R&M s and staff cooperation is constantly sought as this new societal arrangement is a highly complex and volatile mix for everybody involved. Nurses have both a humanistic and a professional duty to be involved and help out. As the camp was run by the army , one could question the impact on culturally conflicting care provision.
