  Preterm infants require high protein intake to achieve adequate growth and development. Although breast milk feeding has many benefits for this population , the protein content is highly variable , and inadequate to support rapid infant growth. This is a 2018 update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1999. To determine whether protein-supplemented human milk compared with unsupplemented human milk , fed to preterm infants , improves growth , body composition , cardio-metabolic , and neurodevelopmental outcomes , without significant adverse effects. We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search CENTRAL , MEDLINE via PubMed , Embase , and CINAHL ( February 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases , conference proceedings and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials ( RCT) and quasi-randomised trials. Published and unpublished RCTs were eligible if they used random or quasi-random methods to allocate hospitalised preterm infants who were being fed human milk , to additional protein supplementation or no supplementation. Two review authors independently abstracted data , assessed risk of bias and the quality of evidence at the outcome level , using GRADE methodology. We performed meta-analyses , using risk ratio ( RR) for dichotomous data , and mean difference ( MD) for continuous data , with their respective 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). We used a fixed-effect model and had planned to explore potential causes of heterogeneity via subgroup or sensitivity analyses. We included six RCTs , involving 204 preterm infants. Low-quality evidence showed that protein supplementation of human milk increased in-hospital rates of growth in weight ( MD 3.82 g/kg/day , 95 % CI 2.94 to 4.7; five RCTs , 101 infants; I ² = 73 %) , length ( MD 0.12 cm/wk , 95 % CI 0.07 to 0.17; four RCTs , 68 infants; I ² = 89 %) , and head circumference ( MD 0.06 cm/wk , 95 % CI 0.01 to 0.12; four RCTs , 68 infants; I ² = 84 %). There was no evidence of a clear difference in rate of growth of skin fold thickness between the supplemented and unsupplemented groups ( triceps MD 0.06 mm/wk , 95 % CI -0.09 to 0.21; one RCT , 20 infants; or subscapular MD 0.00 mm/wk , 95 % CI -0.17 to 0.17; one RCT , 20 infants). Protein supplementation led to longer hospital stays ( MD 18.5 days , 95 % CI 4.39 to 32.61; one RCT , 20 infants; very low-quality evidence) , and higher blood urea nitrogen concentrations compared to the unsupplemented group ( MD 0.95 mmol/L , 95 % CI 0.81 to 1.09; four RCTs , 81 infants; I ² = 56 %). Very low-quality evidence did not show that protein supplementation clearly increased the risk of feeding intolerance ( RR 2.70 , 95 % CI 0.13 to 58.24; one RCT , 17 infants) , or necrotizing enterocolitis<disease> ( RR 1.11 , 95 % CI 0.07 to 17.12; one RCT , 76 infants) , or clearly altered serum albumin concentrations ( MD 2.5 g/L , 95 % CI -5.66 to 10.66; one RCT , 11 infants) , compared with the unsupplemented groups. No data were available about the effects of protein supplementation on long-term growth , body mass index , body composition , neurodevelopmental , or cardio-metabolic outcomes. Low-quality evidence showed that protein supplementation of human milk , fed to preterm infants , increased short-term growth. However , the small sample sizes , low precision , and very low-quality evidence regarding duration of hospital stay , feeding intolerance , and necrotising enterocolitis<disease> precluded any conclusions about these outcomes. There were no data on outcomes after hospital discharge. Our findings may not be generalisable to low-resource settings , as none of the included studies were conducted in these settings.Since protein supplementation of human milk is now usually done as a component of multi-nutrient fortifiers , future studies should compare different amounts of protein in multi-component fortifiers , and be designed to determine the effects on duration of hospital stay and safety , as well as on long-term growth , body composition , cardio-metabolic , and neurodevelopmental outcomes.
