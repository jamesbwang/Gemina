  This review aims to provide an update of recent advances in the epidemiology , clinical features and diagnosis , and management of food-induced anaphylaxis ( FIA). Food allergy prevalence and FIA rates continue to rise , but FIA fatalities are stable. Basophil and mast cell activation tests promise more accurate identification of food triggers. Oral , sublingual , and epicutaneous immunotherapy can desensitize a significant portion of subjects. Epinephrine use for FIA remains sub-optimal. As the burden of food allergy continues to increase , it appears that the corresponding increase in research focused on this epidemic is beginning to bear fruit. The stable number of FIA fatalities in the face of an ongoing epidemic indicates lives have already been saved. The emergence of new diagnostic tests and interventional therapies may transform the management of FIA in the coming years.
