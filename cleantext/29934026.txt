  To compare white matter microstructure in children and adolescents with single ventricle who underwent the Fontan procedure with healthy controls , and to explore the association of white matter injury with cognitive performance as well as patient and medical factors. Fontan ( n = 102) and control subjects ( n = 47) underwent diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) at ages 10-19 years. Mean DTI measures ( fractional anisotropy , radial diffusivity , axial diffusivity , and mean diffusivity) were calculated for 33 fiber tracts from standard white matter atlases. Voxel-wise group differences in DTI measures were assessed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. Associations of regional fractional anisotropy with IQ and processing speed as well as medical characteristics were examined. Subjects with Fontan , compared with controls , had reduced bilateral regional and voxel-wise fractional anisotropy in multiple white matter tracts along with increased regional radial diffusivity in several overlapping tracts; regional mean diffusivity differed in 2 tracts. The groups did not differ in voxel-wise radial diffusivity or mean diffusivity. Among subjects with Fontan , fractional anisotropy in many tracts correlated positively with Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and processing speed , although similar findings were absent in controls. Lower mean fractional anisotropy in various tracts was associated with more complications in the first operation , a greater number of total operations , and history of neurologic event. Children and adolescents who have undergone the Fontan procedure have widespread abnormalities in white matter microstructure. Furthermore , white matter microstructure in several tracts is associated with cognitive performance and operative and medical history characteristics.
