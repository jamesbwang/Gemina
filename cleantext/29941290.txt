  Considering that temperature makes a difference to near-infrared spectrum , a probabilistic principle component regression ( PPCR) based temperature compensation modeling strategy is investigated under the framework of maximum likelihood estimation. First , a PPCR model is established to extract the dynamic information of the spectra at designated experimental temperature. Then , by decomposing the temperature-induced spectral variation into the shift in horizontal direction and the drift in vertical direction , the quantitative expression between spectral variation and temperature change is derived. Based on the decomposition , the estimation of new latent variables that vary with temperature is derived according to the spectral data set collected at certain temperatures. Finally , for performance evaluation , applications of the theoretical results to bisphenol-A and gasoline-ethanol mixture illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the developed techniques.
