  We analysed the basic mechanisms of signal transmission in DNA and the origins of the allostery exhibited by systems such as the ternary complex BAMHI-DNA-GRDBD. We found that perturbation information generated by a primary protein binding event travels as a wave to distant regions of DNA following a hopping mechanism. However , such a structural perturbation is transient and does not lead to permanent changes in the DNA geometry and interaction properties at the secondary binding site. The BAMHI-DNA-GRDBD allosteric mechanism does not occur through any traditional models: direct ( protein-protein) , indirect ( reorganization of the secondary site) readout or solvent-release. On the contrary , it is generated by a subtle and less common entropy-mediated mechanism , which might have an important role to explain other DNA-mediated cooperative effects.
