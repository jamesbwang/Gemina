  Chimeric antigen receptors ( CAR)- T cell therapy has recently made promising advances towards treatment of B-cell malignancies. This approach makes use of an antibody-derived single chain variable fragment ( scFv)- based CAR to target the CD19 antigen. Currently scFvs are the most common strategy for creation of CARs , but tumor cells can also be targeted using non-antibody based approaches with designs focused on the interaction between natural receptors and their ligands. This emerging strategy has been used in unique ways to target multiple tumor types , including solid and haematological malignancies. In this review , we will highlight the performance of receptor-ligand combinations as designs for CARs to treat cancer , with a particular focus on haematologic malignancies.
