  A man in his early 30s with remote history of a febrile rash<symptom> as a toddler presented to the emergency room following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest while riding his bicycle. He received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and one shock<symptom> from an automatic external defibrillator , successfully restoring sinus rhythm. On arrival , he was haemodynamically stable without ECG evidence of ST segment changes to suggest active ischaemia , and an initial troponin I was mildly elevated at 0.10 ng/mL ( normal < 0.04 ng/mL). A CT angiogram ( CTA) was obtained showing a normal-appearing aorta and no abnormal extracardiac findings. Urgent coronary angiography was performed; images are shown in figure 1A-C. Echocardiogram revealed a mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction ( 45 %) with a hypokinetic inferior wall.heartjnl; heartjnl-2018-312966v1/ F1F1F1Figure 1 ( A) Right coronary artery angiogram in the left anterior oblique cranial projection. ( B) Left coronary artery angiogram in the right anterior oblique caudal projection. ( C) Left coronary artery angiogram in the right anterior oblique cranial projection. CAUD , caudal; CRAN , cranial; LAO , left anterior oblique; RAO , right anterior oblique. What is the next best step in the management of this patient at this time?Complete revascularisation via percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). Referral for coronary artery bypass surgery ( CABG). Initiation of high-dose steroids.Initiation of dual-antiplatelet therapy without planned revascularisation.
