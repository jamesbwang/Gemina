  To investigate the effects of silencing transforming growth factor-β activating kinase 1 ( TAK1) on the expressions of IL-6 and IL-8 induced by TNF-α in fibroblast-like synoviocytes , and to explore the role of TAK1 in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). The synthesized TAK1 siRNA and scrambled siRNA ( ScRNA) were transferred into cultured RA fibroblast-like synoviocyte line MH7A by lipofectamine. The expressions of the pro-inflammatory mediator IL-6 and IL-8 and the levels of phospho-P38 ( p-P38) , phospho-C-Jun NH2-terminal kinase ( p-JNK) , phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( p-ERK) , phospho-p65 ( p-p65) and nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor , alpha ( IκBa) were examined. Silencing of TAK was demonstrated in synoviocytes transfected by TAK siRNA. TAK1 silencing markedly attenuated the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in the presence of TNF-α. TAK1 silencing inhibited the activation of p38 and JNK MAPK. TAK1 silencing also inhibited activation of nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB). TAK1 silencing attenuated the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in synoviocytes induced by TNF-α
