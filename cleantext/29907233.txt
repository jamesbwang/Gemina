  Head and neck melanoma is associated with a high false negative ( FN) sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB) rate. If techniques are developed that can decrease FN SLNBs , better prognostic information will be obtained , and it may be possible to improve overall survival as patients are assigned to the appropriate adjuvant management. Our group previously demonstrated that the combination of lymphoscintigraphy and indocyanine green ( ICG) fluorescence-based technology was feasible for SLNB in primary melanoma. Consecutive head and neck cutaneous melanoma patients who underwent radioisotope lymphoscintigraphy and ICG-based fluorescence imaging by the senior author ( B.G.) from 2012 to 2015 were prospectively enrolled for analysis. Patients were followed postoperatively by the multidisciplinary melanoma team. Main outcome variables were FN rate of SLNB. Length of follow-up was date of surgery to the date of last follow-up/death. There were 10 positive SLNBs , 51 true negative SLNBs , and one FN SLNB. False negative rate was 9.1 % , false negative incidence was 1.6 % , sensitivity was 91 % , and specificity was 100 %. Mean follow-up was 27.6 , 17.6 , and 16.5 mo for true negative , true positive , and FN patients , respectively. We report the largest cohort of patients with head and neck cutaneous melanoma undergoing SLNB using both a combination of radioactive tracer , gamma probe , and ICG-based fluorescence identification. Our results demonstrate that using concomitant gamma probe-based radioactivity detection and ICG-based fluorescence for SLN identification in head and neck melanoma is reliable , reproducible and , thus far , has produced a low rate of FN SLNB.
