  To compare the effectiveness of clinician prediction of risk to a standardized assessment of presentation status. All adult psychiatry emergency department consults in the two main hospitals in Winnipeg , Canada , were assessed using a standardized form ( n = 5,376). This form includes two risk scales for a gestalt physician assessment of risk ( Suicide Likelihood scale , suicide Attempt Likelihood scale) and the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment ( C-CASA). Regression determined whether assessments predicted future suicide attempts and deaths. The area under the curve ( AUC) determined the prediction accuracy of these methods. Although the regression results were significant , the AUCs were either moderate or poor. Clinician assessment was not effective at predicting deaths ( AUC = .546 , .36-.73) , but moderately accurate at predicting future attempts ( AUC = .728 , .66-.79). C-CASA assessment was moderately accurate at predicting both attempts and deaths ( AUC = .666 and .678). Clinician assessment does not significantly outperform a simple assessment of the occurrence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors during presentation to the emergency department. Behavior-based standardized assessments should be further researched in this field. Assessment of suicidality at presentation using C-CASA or similar assessment should be standard for psychiatric patients assessed in the emergency department.
