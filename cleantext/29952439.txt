  Physical activity is a pillar stone of health promotion and primary care is perfectly poised to disseminate this message. Primary care however , often fails in this regard , missing an opportunity to promote a simple intervention that is effective , free and easily accessible. This study aimed to determine physical activity levels in Irish General Practitioners and General Practice Trainees in addition to describing the barriers to exercise that exist amongst this cohort. This cross-sectional study of Irish General Practice trainers and trainees captured a categorical record of physical activity as well as a qualitative measure of the perceived barriers to exercise. Only 49 % ( n = 107) of those studied engaged in health enhancing physical activity while 20 % ( n = 44) were completely inactive. Sixty percent ( n = 131) demonstrated excessively sedentary behaviour. The greatest barriers to exercise were time expenditure and exhaustion<symptom>. General practitioners and trainees are more likely to engage with promoting physical activity as a health intervention if its benefits are clearly demonstrable in their own lives. This established trend of inactivity needs to be reversed if physicians wish to realise significant health benefits in their own lives and achieve substantial change in the health behaviours of their patients.
