  For the majority of eyes with choroidal melanoma , radiation therapy is the treatment of choice. Local recurrence after radiation therapy can occur , however , and when it does , salvaging the globe with useful vision is atypical. We report a case of late , local failure 7 years following previous brachytherapy successfully managed with Gamma Knife radiosurgery ( GKR). With 3 years of follow up after GKR , the visual acuity is 20/20 and there is no evidence of systemic metastases. To our knowledge , this is the first report of successful salvage GKR therapy after brachytherapy failure in an eye with choroidal melanoma. GKR is an option for select cases of local recurrence after radiation plaque brachytherapy.
