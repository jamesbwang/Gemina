  Pain is one of the major adverse clinical outcomes of cesarean section ( CS). In the past few years , researchers and physicians have been optimizing post-operative analgesic modalities , but the results are still undesirable for the parturient. The cytochrome P-450 3A4 ( CYP3A4) gene has been reported to contribute significantly to human liver microsomal oxidation of sufentanil and alfentanil. We detected the frequency of CYP3A4 mutant allele , which is associated with the metabolism of diverse drugs , including opioids used for anesthesia. We then investigated the correlation between sufentanil ( an opioid analgesic) consumption and CYP3A4 genetic polymorphism. We found the frequency of the CYP3A4 ∗ 1G ( the mutant form of CYP3A) variant allele to be 0.279 in 71 parturients undergoing cesarean section and 137 age-matched parturients with vaginal delivery. Interestingly , the parturients with homozygous CYP3A4 ∗ 1G showed less sufentanil consumption compared with those having the wild-type genotype. In summary , we found a correlation between CYP3A4 genetic polymorphism and sufentanil consumption. This might be helpful for optimizing the anesthesia strategies and reducing their side effects.
