  The most significant prognostic factor in early breast cancer is lymph node involvement. This stage between localised and systemic<disease> disease<disease> is key to understanding breast cancer progression , however our knowledge of the evolution of lymph node malignant invasion remains limited , as most currently available data derive from primary tumours. In 11 treatment-na√Øve node positive early breast cancer patients without clinical evidence of distant metastasis , we investigated lymph node evolution using spatial multi-region sequencing ( n = 78 samples) of primary and lymph node deposits and genomic profiling of matched longitudinal circulating tumour DNA ( ctDNA). Linear evolution from primary to lymph node was rare ( 1/11) whereas the majority of cases displayed either early divergence between primary and nodes ( 4/11) , or no detectable divergence ( 6/11) where both primary and nodal cells belonged to a single recent expansion of a metastatic clone. Divergence of metastatic subclones was driven in part by APOBEC. Longitudinal ctDNA samples from 2 of 7 subjects with evaluable plasma taken peri-operatively reflected the two major evolutionary patterns and demonstrate that private mutations can be detected even from early metastatic nodal deposits. Moreover , node removal resulted in disappearance of private lymph node mutations in ctDNA. This study sheds new light on a crucial evolutionary step in the natural history of breast cancer , demonstrating early establishment of axillary lymph node metastasis in a substantial proportion of patients.
