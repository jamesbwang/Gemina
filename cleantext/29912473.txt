  Negative symptoms are currently viewed as having a 2-dimensional structure , with factors reflecting diminished expression ( EXP) and motivation and pleasure ( MAP). However , several factor-analytic studies suggest that the consensus around a 2-dimensional model is premature. The current study investigated and cross-culturally validated the factorial structure of BNSS-rated negative symptoms across a range of cultures and languages. Participants included individuals diagnosed with a psychotic disorder who had been rated on the Brief Negative Symptom Scale ( BNSS) from 5 cross-cultural samples , with a total N = 1691. First , exploratory factor analysis was used to extract up to 6 factors from the data. Next , confirmatory factor analysis evaluated the fit of 5 models: ( 1) a 1-factor model , 2) a 2-factor model with factors of MAP and EXP , 3) a 3-factor model with inner world , external , and alogia factors; 4) a 5-factor model with separate factors for blunted affect , alogia , anhedonia , avolition , and asociality , and 5) a hierarchical model with 2 second-order factors reflecting EXP and MAP , as well as 5 first-order factors reflecting the 5 aforementioned domains. Models with 4 factors or less were mediocre fits to the data. The 5-factor , 6-factor , and the hierarchical second-order 5-factor models provided excellent fit with an edge to the 5-factor model. The 5-factor structure demonstrated invariance across study samples. Findings support the validity of the 5-factor structure of BNSS-rated negative symptoms across diverse cultures and languages. These findings have important implications for the diagnosis , assessment , and treatment of negative symptoms.
