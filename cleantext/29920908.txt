  Mental health service users ( MHSUs) often face difficulties in achieving successful participation in education; however , the tools that could help them succeed are rarely investigated. This study aimed to illuminate the experiences of MHSUs in an education intervention based on a European Union ( EU) project. Their experiences are compared across nine EU countries. The data were collected through individual interviews with MHSUs ( n = 47) at day activity centres that provide mental health services. An inductive content analysis was used as the method of analysis. Three main categories , which include seven subcategories , are revealed by the analysis. The main categories are as follows: ( i) the factors related to MHSUs ' educational preparedness , ( ii) the dimensions of the learning environment , and ( iii) the effects of training intervention. The MHSUs ' experiences with the education intervention were similar across all countries. The findings showed that this education intervention is a multidimensional process. It contains social , mental , and physical dimensions linked to a learner and learning environment. These dimensions influence the MHSUs ' ability to participate in the education process. At its best , the education intervention supports the personal growth of MHSUs and prepares them for social integration. An education intervention can be a usable tool in the rehabilitation of MHSUs if the multidimensional nature of education is taken into consideration. Therefore , designing and executing education interventions requires the attendance of the MHSUs in cooperation with mental health and education professionals. Our findings suggest a tentative framework that can be used in designing and executing education for MHSUs.
