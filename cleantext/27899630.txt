  Advances in high-throughput sequencing have led to unprecedented growth in the amount of available genome sequencing data , especially for bacterial genomes , which has been accompanied by a challenge for the storage and management of such huge datasets. To facilitate bacterial research and related studies , we have developed the Mypathogen database ( MPD) , which provides access to users for searching , downloading , storing and sharing bacterial genomics data. The MPD represents the first pathogenic database for microbial genomes and metagenomes , and currently covers pathogenic microbial genomes ( 6604 genera , 11 071 species , 41 906 strains) and metagenomic data from host , air , water and other sources ( 28 816 samples). The MPD also functions as a management system for statistical and storage data that can be used by different organizations , thereby facilitating data sharing among different organizations and research groups. A user-friendly local client tool is provided to maintain the steady transmission of big sequencing data. The MPD is a useful tool for analysis and management in genomic research , especially for clinical Centers for Disease Control and epidemiological studies , and is expected to contribute to advancing knowledge on pathogenic bacteria genomes and metagenomes.Database URL: http://data.mypathogen.org.
