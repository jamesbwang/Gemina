  Mesoporous magnetic silica particles bearing a stimuli-responsive polymer valve were prepared and their performance as a microcapsule was evaluated. In this study , first , mesoporous magnetic iron oxide ( Fe3O4) particles were prepared by a solvothermal method. Then , the magnetic particles were coated with silica and functionalized with vinyl groups using 3- ( trimethoxysilyl)- propyl methacrylate ( MPS). Subsequently , the Fe3O4/SiO2 composite particles grafted with MPS were used to carry out the seeded precipitation copolymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide ( NIPAM) and 2,2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate ( DMA). Here N , N '- methylenebisacrylamide ( MBA) was used as a cross-linker. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller ( BET) surface analysis suggested that the mesoporous structure was retained in the final Fe3O4/SiO2/P ( NIPAM-DMA-MBA) composite hydrogel particles. The prepared Fe3O4/SiO2/P ( NIPAM-DMA-MBA) composite hydrogel microspheres exhibited a pH-dependent volume phase transition. At lower pH values ( < 7) , the inclusion of DMA shifted the volume phase transition to higher temperature because of the protonation of the tertiary amine groups. The composite hydrogel particles possessed a high saturation magnetization ( 51 emu g-1) and moved under the influence of an external magnetic field. The loading-release behaviour of these biologically active molecules suggested that a portion of the encapsulated guest molecules was released at a temperature below the lower critical solution temperature , LCST ( < 35 Â°C).
