  The aim of this study was to examine predictors that lead to the utilization of Behavioural Couple Therapy ( BCT) for patients with alcohol dependence ( AD) in a- European health care system and to identify groups that have a low probability of utilizing BCT. Using routinely collected data from a German rehabilitation clinic , a sample of 1,843 inpatients with AD living in a couple relationship was examined. Each patient could freely choose to participate in an addiction-specific BCT as a voluntary additional intervention during an inpatient treatment program. The logistic regression analysis indicated that female gender , older age and a higher number of comorbid disorders were associated with a decreased probability of utilizing BCT. The decision tree found that for men , the lowest utilization rate was in the age range of 51-54 and from the age of 58 years; women with higher pressure by their partner in combination with more than 1 comorbid mental disorder and women with lower pressure by their partner ( regardless of comorbid disorders) showed the lowest utilization rate. Certain subgroups of patients with AD are less likely to participate in BCT during inpatient treatment.
