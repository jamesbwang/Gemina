  Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is a major cause of dementia in the elderly with no effective treatment. Accumulation of amyloid-β peptide ( Aβ) in the brain is a pathological hallmark of AD and is believed to be a central disease-causing and disease-promoting event. In a previous study , we showed that deletion of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 ( PAI-1) , a primary inhibitor of tissue type and urokinase type plasminogen activators ( tPA and uPA) , significantly reduced brain Aβ load in APP/PS1 mice , an animal model of familial AD. In this study , we further show that oral administration of TM5275 , a small molecule inhibitor of PAI-1 , for a period of 6 weeks , inhibits the activity of PAI-1 and increases the activities of tPA and uPA as well as plasmin , which is associated with a reduction of Aβ load in the hippocampus and cortex and improvement of learning/memory function in APP/PS1 mice. Protein abundance of low density lipoprotein related protein-1 ( LRP-1) , a multi ligand endocytotic receptor involved in transporting Aβ out of the brain , as well as plasma Aβ42 are increased , whereas the expression and processing of full-length amyloid-β protein precursor is not affected by TM5275 treatment in APP/PS1 mice. In vitro studies further show that PAI-1 increases , whereas TM5275 reduces , Aβ40 level in the culture medium of SHSY5Y-APP neuroblastoma cells. Collectively , our data suggest that TM5275 improves memory function of APP/PS1 mice , probably by reducing brain Aβ accumulation through increasing plasmin-mediated degradation and LRP-1-mediated efflux of Aβ in the brain.
