  Various stent retrievers differing in stent design and mechanical properties are currently available for the treatment of ischemic stroke. We conducted this in vitro study to compare the efficacy , embolism rate , and safety of commercially available stent retrievers and prototypes. Whole blood thrombi were produced in a Chandler loop. The thrombi were inserted into the curved M1 segment of a silicone model of the anterior cerebral circulation. Thrombectomy maneuvers were performed with six commercially available stent retrievers and 2 prototypes with different strut thickness. Wall-stent apposition , first pass recanalization rate , retraction force , and embolism rate were compared. Devices with complete wall-stent apposition had the highest first pass recanalization rate and lowest embolism rate , but showed the highest retraction force. The prototype with thinner struts had a comparable recanalization and embolism rate , while a lower retraction force had to be applied compared to the prototype with thicker struts. Complete wall-stent apposition facilitates a higher recanalization rate and lower embolism rate but also correlates to a higher necessary retraction force and thus possibly higher risk of endothelium damage. Stent modifications leading to a reduced retraction force do not compromise efficacy and embolism rate. · Complete wall-stent apposition facilitates an effective thrombectomy. · Complete wall-stent apposition leads to higher retraction force and possibly greater endothelium damage. · Modifications of strut thickness do not compromise recanalization and embolism rate. · Thinner struts correlate with a lower retraction force. · Larsen N , Oberbeck K , Lima de Miranda R et al..
