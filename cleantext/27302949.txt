  In normal metals the magnetic moment of impurity-spins disappears below a characteristic Kondo temperature which marks the formation of a cloud of conduction-band electrons that screen the local-moment. In contrast , moments embedded in insulators remain unscreened at all temperatures. What then is the fate of magnetic-moments in intermediate , pseudogap systems , such as graphene? Theory predicts that coupling to the conduction-band electrons will drive a quantum phase transition between a local-moment phase and a Kondo-screened phase. However , attempts to experimentally confirm this prediction and its intriguing consequences , such as electrostatically tunable magnetic-moments , have been elusive. Here we report the observation of Kondo-screening and the quantum phase-transition between screened and unscreened phases of vacancy magnetic moments in graphene. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy and numerical renormalization-group calculations we show that this transition enables to control the screening of local moments by tuning the gate voltage and the local curvature of the graphene membrane.
