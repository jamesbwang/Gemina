  The discovery of chlorpromazine in the early 1950s revolutionized the clinical treatment of schizophrenia , galvanized the development of psychopharmacology , and standardized protocols used for testing the clinical efficacy of antipsychotics. Furthermore , chlorpromazine expanded our understanding of the role of chemical messaging in neurotransmission and reduced the stigma associated with mental illness , facilitating deinstitutionalization in the 1960s and 1970s. In this review , we will discuss the synthesis , manufacturing , metabolism and pharmacokinetics , pharmacology , structure-activity relationship , and adverse effects of chlorpromazine. In conclusion , we summarize the history and significant contributions of chlorpromazine that have resulted in this potent first-generation antipsychotic maintaining its clinical relevance for nearly 70 years.
