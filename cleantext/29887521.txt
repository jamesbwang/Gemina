  Tollip , a well-established endogenous modulator of Toll-like receptor signaling , is involved in cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Tollip in neointima formation and its associated mechanisms. In this study , transient increases in Tollip expression were observed in platelet-derived growth factor-BB-treated vascular smooth muscle cells and following vascular injury in mice. We then applied loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches to elucidate the effects of Tollip on neointima formation. While exaggerated neointima formation was observed in Tollip-deficient murine neointima formation models , Tollip overexpression alleviated vascular injury-induced neointima formation by preventing vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation , dedifferentiation , and migration. Mechanistically , we demonstrated that Tollip overexpression may exert a protective role in the vasculature by suppressing Akt-dependent signaling , which was further confirmed in rescue experiments using the Akt-specific inhibitor ( AKTI). Our findings indicate that Tollip protects against neointima formation by negatively regulating vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation , dedifferentiation , and migration in an Akt-dependent manner. Upregulation of Tollip may be a promising strategy for treating vascular remodeling-related diseases.
