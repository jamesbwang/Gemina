  Dengue is a worldwide problem characterized by a multifactorial pathogenesis. Considering the viral components , it is known that high viremia or high levels of the secreted nonstructural protein 1 ( NS1) may be associated with a more severe disease. We aimed to characterize the NS1 antigenemia and viremia in dengue fatal and non-fatal cases , as potential markers of progression to a fatal outcome. NS1 antigenemia and viremia were determined in Brazilian dengue fatal cases (
