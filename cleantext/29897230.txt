  Fluid-fluid interfaces have widespread applications in personal care products , the food industry , oil recovery , mineral processes , etc. and are also important and versatile platforms for generating advanced materials. In Pickering emulsions , particles stabilize the fluid-fluid interface , and their presence reduces the interfacial energy between the two fluids. To date , most Pickering emulsions stabilized by 2D particles make use of clay platelets or GO nanosheets. These systems have been used to template higher order hybrid , functional materials , most commonly , armored polymer particles , capsules , and Janus nanosheets. This review discusses the experimental and computational study of the assembly of sheet-like 2D particles at fluid-fluid interfaces , with an emphasis on the impact of chemical composition , and the use of these assemblies to prepare composite structures of dissimilar materials. The review culminates in a perspective on the future of Pickering emulsions using 2D particle surfactants , including new chemical modification and types of particles as well as the realization of properties and applications not possible with currently accessible systems , such as lubricants , porous structures , delivery , coatings , etc..
