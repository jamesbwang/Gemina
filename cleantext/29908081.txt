  Meconium concentrations of naturally accumulated ceruloplasmin ( CER) , lactoferrin ( LF) , and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL) and their relationships considered as a panel of acute phase proteins could be used for the assessment of fetal homeostasis. CER , LF and NGAL concentrations were measured using ELISA kits in meconium portions ( n = 80) collected from 19 healthy neonates. The coefficients of variation ( CV) of the meconium LF ( 1.77) and NGAL ( 1.26) were about 2-fold higher than that of CER ( 0.73) with significant ( p < 0.05) correlations between all three parameters. The LF to NGAL ratio ( CV = 0.67) correlated strongly with the CER concentrations ( r = 0.39 , p < 0.01). These correlations between CER , LF and NGAL concentrations suggest their combined involvement in the metabolic processes in the developing fetus. This article is protected by copyright.
