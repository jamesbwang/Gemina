  Passive administration of broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bNAbs) capable of recognizing a broad range of viral strains to non-human primates has led to protection from infection with chimeric SIV/HIV virus ( SHIV). This data suggests that generating protective antibody responses could be an effective strategy for an HIV<pathogen> vaccine. However , classic vaccine approaches have failed so far to induce such protective antibodies in HIV<pathogen> vaccine trials. HIV-specific bNAbs identified in natural infection show high levels of somatic hypermutations , demonstrating that they underwent extensive affinity maturation. It is likely that to gain ability to recognize diverse viral strains , vaccine-induced humoral responses will also require complex , iterative maturation. T follicular helper cells ( Tfh) are a specialized CD4 + T cell subset that provides help to B cells in the germinal center for the generation of high-affinity and long-lasting humoral responses. It is therefore probable that the quality and quantity of Tfh responses upon vaccination will impact development of bNAbs. Here , we review studies that advanced our understanding of Tfh differentiation , function and regulation. We discuss correlates of Tfh responses and bNAb development in natural HIV<pathogen> infection. Finally , we highlight recent strategies to optimize Tfh responses upon vaccination and their impact on prophylactic HIV<pathogen> vaccine research.
