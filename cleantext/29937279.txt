  Attention can be `` covertly '' directed without eye movements<symptom>; yet , even during fixation , there are continuous microsaccades ( MSs). In areas V4 and IT of macaques , we found that firing rates and stimulus representations were enhanced by attention but only following a MS toward the attended stimulus. The onset of neural attentional modulations was tightly coupled to the MS onset. The results reveal a major link between the effects of covert attention on cortical visual processing and the overt movement of the eyes.
