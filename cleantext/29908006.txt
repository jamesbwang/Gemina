  In the present work leaf essential oil from 97 individuals of Juniperus phoenicea var. turbinata ( GUSS.) PARL. from the Balkan Peninsula was analysed. The essential oil was dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons ( 45.5- 71.8 %) , of which α-pinene was the most abundant in almost all of the samples ( 38.2- 55.8 %). Several other monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were also present in relatively high abundances in samples such as myrcene , δ-3-carene , ß-phellandrene , α-terpinyl acetate , ( E)- caryophyllene and germacrene D. Multivariate statistical analysis suggested the existence of three possible chemotypes based on the abundance of the four components. Even though the intrapopulation variability was high , discriminant analysis ( DA) was able to separate populations. DA showed high separation between western and eastern populations but also grouped geographically closer populations along the west Balkan shoreline. The potential influence of the climate on the composition of the essential oil was also studied. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
