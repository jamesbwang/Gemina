  The thrombolysis in micro-circulation after acute myocardial infarction has been an unsolved issue , as elimination effect of acute thrombolysis and primary intervention were unsatisfied. Stable cavitation using acoustic phase-change nanoparticles may have potential for thrombolysis. Therefore , we sought to investigate a novel treatment method with dodecafluoropentane ( DDFP) nanoparticles for rapid and effective thrombolysis in an in-vitro artificial vascular system , as a mimicking preparation of coronary circulation. To simulate thrombus embolism in coronary circulation , an in-vitro artificial vascular system was established with cavitation effect using DDFP nanoparticles. For PBS blank control ( group A) , SonoVue microbubbles ( group B) and DDFP nanoparticles ( group C) , the durations for cavitation effect were recorded and the thrombolysis efficiency with low intensity focused ultrasound irradiation in the in-vitro vascular system were analyzed with weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and pathological changes of thrombus before and after thrombolysis. The optimal conditions for acoustic cavitation effect were power of 6 W for 20 min by ultrasound irradiation at 37 °C. The weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and weight<symptom> loss<symptom> rates of thrombus in group C ( 189.4 ± 30.2 mg and 34.2 ± 5.7 %) were higher than those in group A ( 30.2 ± 16.0 mg and 5.2 ± 2.1 %) and group B ( 84.0 ± 20.4 mg and 14.6 ± 1.5 %) ( P < 0.01 , all). The duration for cavitation effect in group C ( 32.8 ± 3.9 min) was also longer than those in group A ( 0.0 ± 0.0 min) and group B ( 5.3 ± 0.3 min) ( P < 0.01 , all). By stable and sustaining cavitation in targeted area , DDFP nanoparticles with ultrasound irradiation have significantly increased the thrombolysis efficiency , which has provided a powerful experimental foundation for potential coronary thrombolysis.
