  TARDBP ( TAR DNA binding protein) is one of the components of neuronal aggregates in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We have developed a simple quantitative method to evaluate TARDBP splicing function that was applied to spinal cord , brainstem , motor cortex , and occipital cortex in ALS ( n = 8) cases compared to age- and gender-matched control ( n = 17). Then , we quantified the abundance of a TARDBP-spliced cryptic exon present in ATG4B ( autophagy related 4B cysteine peptidase) mRNA. Results of these analyses demonstrated that the loss of this TARDBP function in spinal cord , brainstem , motor cortex , and occipital cortex differentiated ALS from controls ( area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic: 0.85). Significant correlations were also observed between cryptic exon levels , age , disease duration , and aberrant mRNA levels. To test if TARDBP function in splicing is relevant in ATG4B major function ( autophagy) we downregulated TARDBP expression in human neural tissue and in HeLa cells , demonstrating that TARDBP is required for maintaining the expression of ATG4B. Further , ATG4B overexpression alone is sufficient to completely prevent the increase of SQSTM1 induced by TARDBP downregulation in human neural tissue cells and in cell lines. In conclusion , the present findings demonstrate abnormal alternative splicing of ATG4B transcripts in ALS neural tissue in agreement with TARDBP loss of function , leading to impaired autophagy. ALS: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ATG4B: autophagy related 4B cysteine peptidase; AUC: area under the curve; FTLD: frontotemporal lobar degeneration; iPSC: induced pluripotent stem cells; ROC: receiver operating characteristic; TARDBP: TAR DNA binding protein; RT-qPCR: quantitative RT-PCR.
