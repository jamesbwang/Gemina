  SiC-AlN multiphase ceramics with 10 wt. % Y ₂ O ₃- BaO-SiO ₂ additives were fabricated by pressureless sintering in a nitrogen atmosphere. The effects of SiC contents and sintering temperatures on the sinterability , microstructure , thermal conductivity and high-frequency dielectric properties were characterized. In addition to 6H-SiC and AlN , the samples also contained Y ₃ Al ₅ O
