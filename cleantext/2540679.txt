Although it is a medically benign condition , it can have a significant psychosocial impact on patients. `` Metabolic syndrome<disease> '' ( MetS) is a collection of clinical signs that focus on cardiovascular and diabetes-related parameters. Despite the high burden of AGA and MetS in India , specific data on the participants are relatively sparse. The aim of is to study the association of AGA with MetS and its parameters. A case-control study was undertaken in a tertiary care hospital from December 2015 to November 2016 with 100 cases and controls in the age group of 20-50 years. Diagnosis of MetS was based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III.

Early screening for MetS is beneficial in patients with androgenic alopecia.
