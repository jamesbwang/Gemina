  The use of allogeneic bone grafts for alveolar ridge reconstruction has become an often-discussed alternative to augmentation procedures using autografts. Nevertheless , there still is a lack of literature concerning long-time experiences of allografts for alveolar ridge reconstruction. Especially the results of the use of allogeneic bone blocks for mandible reconstructions need to be further investigated. In this case report , we present the use of customized allogenic bone blocks in Guided Bone Regeneration ( GBR) procedures for severely deficient mandibulary bones , the implantation after a healing period of 5 month and the 24-month follow-up data. Customized allogeneic bone blocks seem to be a successful alternative to augmentations with autologous bone blocks reconstructing highly resorbed mandibulary alveolar ridges , showing highest volume stability and no signs of bone resorption after implant loading. The application of customized allogeneic bone blocks has shown to be a successful augmentation technique even compared with with autologous bone blocks reconstructing highly resorbed mandibulary alveolar ridges demonstrating no compromises regarding clinical outcome , functionality and esthetics.
