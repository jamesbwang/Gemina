  Letermovir is a human cytomegalovirus ( CMV) terminase inhibitor for the prophylaxis of CMV infection in allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant ( HSCT) recipients. In vitro , letermovir is a time-dependent inhibitor and an inducer of cytochrome P450 ( CYP) 3A , and an inhibitor of CYP2C8 and organic anion transporting polypeptide ( OATP) 1B. A stepwise approach was taken to qualify the interaction model of an existing letermovir physiologically-based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK) model to predict letermovir interactions with CYP3A and OATP1B. The model was then used to prospectively predict the interaction between letermovir and CYP2C8 substrates such as repaglinide , a substrate of CYP2C8 , CYP3A and OATP1B. The results showed that letermovir modestly increased the exposure of CYP2C8 substrates. These results were used to inform on the U.S. prescribing information in the absence of clinical drug-drug interaction studies. In addition , midazolam interactions with letermovir at therapeutic doses were also simulated to confirm that letermovir is a moderate CYP3A inhibitor. This article is protected by copyright.
