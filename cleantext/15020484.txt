  The study of gene family evolution has benefited from the use of phylogenetic tools , which can greatly inform studies of both relationships within gene families and functional divergence. Here , we propose the use of a network-based approach that in combination with phylogenetic methods can provide additional support for models of gene family evolution. We dissect the contributions of each method to the improved understanding of relationships and functions within the well-characterized family of
