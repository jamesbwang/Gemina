  Failure of delivering a stent or a balloon across the target lesion<symptom> during percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) of chronic total occlusion ( CTO) , especially in arteries with calcified tortuous anatomy , is often due to insufficient backup support from the guiding catheter. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of the GuideLiner ( GL) catheter use. We examined 18 patients and used the GL catheter to overcome poor support and excessive friction in standardized antegrade and retrograde CTO procedures. The GL is a coaxial , monorail guiding catheter extension delivered through a standard guiding catheter and is available in different sizes. Almost all lesions<symptom> were classified as severely calcified ( 94.4 ± 0.24 %). The Japanese CTO score reflecting lesion<symptom> complexity was 3.56 ± 0.78. All procedures were performed femorally; the retrograde approach was used in 27.8 ± 0.46 % of cases. The overall success rate was 88.9 ± 0.32 %; there were no relevant complications. The GL catheter is an adjunctive interventional device which enhances and amplifies CTO-PCI. Its use is indicated in cases in which back-up force needs to be strengthened to pass a CTO despite advanced calcification. It can be recommended as an important additional tool in advanced interventional cardiology such as antegrade and retrograde CTO-PCI if other techniques like anchor balloon or anchor wire are not possible.
