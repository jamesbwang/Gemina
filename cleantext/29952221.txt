  Cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2/ PTGS2) mediates hyperoxia-induced impairment of lung development in newborn animals , and is increased in lungs of human infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD). COX-2 catalyzes production of cytoprotective prostaglandins such as prostacyclin ( PGI2) as well as pro-inflammatory mediators such as thromboxane A2 ( TxA2). Our objective was to determine whether iloprost , a synthetic analog of prostacyclin , would attenuate hyperoxia effects in the newborn mouse lung. To test this hypothesis , newborn C57BL/6 mice along with their dams were exposed to normoxia ( 21 %) or hyperoxia ( 85 % O2) from 4 to 14 days of age in combination with daily i.p. injections of either iloprost 200 µg/kg/day , nimesulide ( selective COX-2 antagonist) 100 mg/kg/day , or vehicle. Alveolar development was estimated by Radial Alveolar Counts ( RAC) and Mean Linear Intercepts ( MLI). Lung function was determined on a flexiVent , and multiple cytokines and myeloperoxidase ( MPO) were quantitated in lung homogenates. Lung vascular and microvascular morphometry was performed , and right ventricle/left ventricle ratios were determined. We determined that iloprost ( but not nimesulide) administration attenuated hyperoxia-induced inhibition of alveolar development and microvascular density in newborn mice. Iloprost and nimesulide both attenuated hyperoxia-induced increased lung resistance , but did not improve lung compliance that was reduced by hyperoxia. Iloprost and nimesulide reduced hyperoxia-induced increases in MPO and some cytokines ( IL-1β and TNF-α) but not others ( IL-6 and KC/Gro). There were no changes in pulmonary arterial wall thickness or right ventricle/left ventricle ratios. We conclude that iloprost improves lung development and reduces lung inflammation<symptom> in a newborn mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
