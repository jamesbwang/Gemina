  OBJECTIVE Cerebral cavernous malformations ( CCMs) are frequently diagnosed vascular malformations of the brain. Although most CCMs are asymptomatic , some can be responsible for intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> or seizures<symptom>. In selected cases , microsurgical resection is the preferred treatment option. Treatment with the unselective β-blocker propranolol has been presumed to stabilize and eventually lead to CCM size regression in a limited number of published case series; however , the underlying mechanism and evidence for this effect remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the risk for CCM-related hemorrhage<symptom> in patients on long-term β-blocker medication. METHODS A single-center database containing data on patients harboring CCMs was retrospectively interrogated for a time period of 35 years. The database included information about hemorrhage<symptom> and antihypertensive medication. Descriptive and survival analyses were performed , focusing on the risk of hemorrhage<symptom> at presentation and during follow-up ( first or subsequent hemorrhage<symptom>) in patients on long-term β-blocker medication versus those who were not. Follow-up was censored at the first occurrence of new hemorrhage<symptom> , surgery , or the last clinical review. For purposes of this analysis , the β-blocker group was divided into the following main subgroups: any β-blocker , β1-selective β-blocker , and any unselective β-blocker. RESULTS Of 542 CCMs among 408 patients , 81 ( 14.9 %) were under treatment with any β-blocker; 65 ( 12 %) received β1-selective β-blocker , and 16 ( 3 %) received any unselective β-blocker. One hundred thirty-six ( 25.1 %) CCMs presented with hemorrhage<symptom> at diagnosis. None of the β-blocker groups was associated with a lower risk of hemorrhage<symptom> at the time of diagnosis in a univariate descriptive analysis ( any β-blocker: p = 0.64 , β1-selective: p = 0.93 , any unselective β-blocker: p = 0.25). Four hundred ninety-six CCMs were followed up after diagnosis and included in the survival analysis , for a total of 1800 lesion-years. Follow-up hemorrhage<symptom> occurred in 36 ( 7.3 %) CCMs. Neither univariate descriptive nor univariate Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis showed a decreased risk for follow-up hemorrhage<symptom> under treatment with β-blocker medication ( any β-blocker: p = 0.70 , HR 1.19 , 95 % CI 0.49-2.90; β1-selective: p = 0.78 , HR 1.15 , 95 % CI 0.44-3.00; any unselective β-blocker: p = 0.76 , HR 1.37 , 95 % CI 0.19-10.08). Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis including brainstem location , hemorrhage<symptom> at diagnosis , age , and any β-blocker treatment showed no reduced risk for follow-up hemorrhage<symptom> under any β-blocker treatment ( p = 0.53 , HR 1.36 , 95 % CI 0.52-3.56). CONCLUSIONS In this retrospective cohort study , β-blocker medication does not seem to be associated with a decreased risk of CCM-related hemorrhage<symptom> at presentation or during follow-up.
