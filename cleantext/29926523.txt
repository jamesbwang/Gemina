  Esophageal cancer is one of the most common cancers and a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. However , the mechanism of esophageal cancer pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) dysregulation have been reported to involve in various human cancers , which highlights the potential of lncRNAs used as novel biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. Although more efforts have been made to identify novel lncRNAs signature in esophageal cancer , the expression pattern , prognostic value , and biological function of most lncRNAs in esophageal cancer still need to be systematically investigated. In this study , we comprehensively analyzed the expression profile of lncRNAs in more than 200 esophageal cancer patients tissue samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO). We identified thousands of lncRNAs are differentially expressed in esophageal cancer tissues , and many of those lncRNAs expression are associated with patients overall survival or recurrence-free survival time. Moreover , copy number variation analyses revealed that genomic loci copy number amplification or deletion might contribute to these lncRNAs dysregulation. Among these lncRNAs , DUXAP8 and LINC00460 were significantly upregulated , and GO enrichment analyses indicated that the two lncRNAs associated protein-coding genes involve with many known biological processes , such as cell cycle and cell-cell adherens junction. Further experimental validation revealed that knockdown of DUXAP8 could impair esophageal cancer cells proliferation and invasion in vitro. Taken together , our findings identified more aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in esophageal cancer that may provide a useful resource for identifying novel esophageal cancer associated lncRNAs.
