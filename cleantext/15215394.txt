  Chloroplast genomes of plants are highly conserved in both gene order and gene content , are maternally inherited , and have a lower rate of evolution. Chloroplast genomes are considered to be good models for testing lineage-specific molecular evolution. In this study , we use Schisandraceae as an example to generate insights into the overall evolutionary dynamics in chloroplast genomes and to establish the phylogenetic relationship of Schisandraceae based on chloroplast genome data using phylogenomic analysis. By comparing three Schisandraceae chloroplast genomes , we demonstrate that the gene order , gene content , and length of chloroplast genomes in Schisandraceae are highly conserved but experience dynamic evolution among species. The number of repeat variations were detected , and the Schisandraceae chloroplast genome was revealed as unusual in having a 10 kb contraction of the IR due to the genome size variations compared with other angiosperms. Phylogenomic analysis based on 82 protein-coding genes from 66 plant taxa clearly elucidated that Schisandraceae is a sister to a clade that includes magnoliids , monocots , and eudicots within angiosperms. As to genus relationships within Schisandraceae , Kadsura and Schisandra formed a monophyletic clade which was sister to Illicium.
