  Resveratrol improves healthspan and lifespan in many organisms. Several different targets and mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain the beneficial effects of resveratrol on healthspan and longevity , including the activation of a family of proteins known as sirtuins and its action as a calorie restriction mimetic. In this mini-review , we discuss some of the most recent findings to date in the resveratrol field and suggest three areas of future research based on those results.
