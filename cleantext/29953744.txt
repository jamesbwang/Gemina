  Rheumatology has been a less attractive career choice than other internal medicine ( IM) subspecialties. Recent fellowship `` Match '' data suggested this may have changed. We therefore evaluated the current attractiveness of rheumatology and compared it with other medical subspecialties. Data from the `` Match '' from 2008 - 2017 , the 2015 American College of Rheumatology workforce study , and Medscape physician salaries from 2010 - 2017 were used to determine annual numbers of fellowship applicants , availability of positions , and post-fellowship salary trends. Data from 2008 - 2013 were compared with 2014- 2017 , and rheumatology with other IM subspecialties. The total number of annual applicants to rheumatology for 2008- 2013 decreased from 251 to 244 , a 3 % decrease ( average annual percentage change of -1.9 % ± 2.6 ( mean ± SEM)). However , for 2014- 2017 annual rheumatology applications increased from 230 to 332 , a 44 % increase ( average annual percentage change of 20.7 % ± 10.5 ( p = 0.03)). Other non-procedural and procedural IM subspecialties did not exhibit such an increase. For rheumatology the ratio of annual applicants to positions ( p = 0.02) and percentage of US medical graduates applying ( p = 0.03) were statistically significantly increased , while mean post-fellowship salary also rose. These observations suggest that rheumatology has become more attractive since 2014. We speculate that the increasing popularity of the field is multifactorial , likely reflecting lifestyle , job satisfaction and availability , influences of mentors , and other elements. This is a salutary and potentially exciting opportunity for rheumatology that should be exploited. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
