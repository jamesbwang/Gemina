  ( Purpose) This study examines the relationship between the results of computer-based testing ( CBT) and level of satisfaction with learning , school life , graduation research , and national examination results among freshman and sophomore undergraduate physical therapy students. ( Subjects and Methods) The subjects of this survey were 56 male and 42 female physical therapy students who graduated from the International University of Health and Welfare , Ohtawara , in March 2017. The students were ranked according to four 25th-percentile groups based on the results of CBT , which was conducted at the end of freshman and sophomore years. A visual analog scale was used to assess satisfaction levels at the end of sophomore , junior , and senior years. The results of the national examination were scored independently. ( Results) Compared with the freshman-year CBT results , we found a significant difference in learning satisfaction during the senior year and in the national examination. In addition , compared with the sophomore-year CBT results , there was a significant difference in learning satisfaction for sophomore , junior , and senior years , as well as in the national examination. ( Conclusion) We found a link between the CBT results from freshman and sophomore years and those from the national examination. The results suggest that CBT has an educational effect.
