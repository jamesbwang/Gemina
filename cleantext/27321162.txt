  Protein kinase M ζ is well known for its role in maintaining memory and pain. Previously , we revealed that the activation of protein kinase M ζ in the anterior cingulate cortex plays a role in sustaining neuropathic pain. However , the mechanism by which protein kinase M ζ is expressed in the anterior cingulate cortex by peripheral nerve injury , and whether blocking of protein kinase M ζ using its inhibitor , zeta inhibitory peptide , produces analgesic effects in neuropathic pain maintained chronically after injury , have not previously been resolved. In this study , we show that protein kinase M ζ expression in the anterior cingulate cortex is enhanced by peripheral nerve injury in a transcription-independent manner. We also reveal that the inhibition of protein kinase M ζ through zeta inhibitory peptide treatment is enough to reduce mechanical allodynia responses in mice with one-month-old nerve injuries. However , the zeta inhibitory peptide treatment was only effective for a limited time.
