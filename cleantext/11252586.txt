  To investigate the longitudinal dose-effect relationship between dopamine replacement therapy and impulse control disorders ( ICDs) in Parkinson disease ( PD). We used data from a multicenter longitudinal cohort of consecutive patients with PD with ≤ 5 years ' disease duration at baseline followed up annually up to 5 years. ICDs were evaluated during face-to-face semistructured interviews with movement disorder specialists. Generalized estimating equations and Poisson models with robust variance were used to study the association between several time-dependent definitions of dopamine agonist ( DA) use , taking dose and duration of treatment into account , and ICDs at each visit. Other antiparkinsonian drugs were also examined. Among 411 patients ( 40.6 % women , mean age 62.3 years , average follow-up 3.3 years , SD 1.7 years) , 356 ( 86.6 %) took a DA at least once since disease onset. In 306 patients without ICDs at baseline , the 5-year cumulative incidence of ICDs was 46.1 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 37.4-55.7 , DA ever users 51.5 % ( 95 % CI 41.8-62.1) , DA never users 12.4 % ( 95 % CI 4.8-30.0)). ICD prevalence increased from 19.7 % at baseline to 32.8 % after 5 years. ICDs were associated with ever DA use ( prevalence ratio 4.23 , 95 % CI 1.78-10.09). Lifetime average daily dose and duration of treatment were independently associated with ICDs with significant dose-effect relationships. Similar analyses for levodopa were not in favor of a strong association. ICDs progressively resolved after DA discontinuation. In this longitudinal study of patients with PD characterized by a high prevalence of DA treatment , the 5-year cumulative incidence of ICDs was ≈ 46 %. ICDs were strongly associated with DA use with a dose-effect relationship; both increasing duration and dose were associated with ICDs. ICDs progressively resolved after DA discontinuation.
