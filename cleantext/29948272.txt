  To assess the remineralization capacity of carious , non-carious , and combined white spot lesions<symptom> ( WSLs) using the ICDAS and SS-OCT. This clinical trial was based on a quasi-experimental design. Forty-two healthy subjects ( median age 26.6 years) , who visited university hospital and had at least one WSL with an ICDAS score of 2 or 1 , were recruited. The subjects chewed a non-blind sugar-free gum containing bioavailable calcium and fluoride for 3 months. The remineralization capacities of carious and non-carious 121 WSLs were assessed using ICDAS by two calibrated non-blind examiners and optical boundary depth ( BD) by SS-OCT at a monthly recall. The outcome variables , transitions of ICDAS score , mean BD , and mean BD recovery rate ( RR %) , were statistically analyzed using the chi-square test , two way-repeated measures ANOVA , and Wilcoxon rank sum test , respectively ( alpha = 0.05). Based on the visual inspection , OCT images at the baseline , 72 WSLs were purely carious , 20 were non-carious ( developmental) lesions<symptom> , while 29 were combined ( carious-developmental). The responses of WSLs over time showed to be highly variable. There was a significant difference in transitions of ICDAS scores after 3 months between carious and non-carious WSLs ( p < 0.05) and non-carious and combined WSLs ( p < 0.05). Carious and combined WSLs underwent significant changes in the mean BD between baseline ( 161.8 ± 56.8 μm) and 2 months ( 130.7 ± 57.4 μm) or 3 months ( 119.1 ± 57.5 μm) ( p < 0.05) , while there was no significant difference between baseline ( 132.2 ± 26.2 μm) and 2 months ( 122.8 ± 24.1 μm) or 3 months ( 119.8 ± 22.6 μm) in non-carious WSLs ( p > 0.05). There was a significant difference in mean RR % after 2 and 3 months between carious and non-carious WSLs ( p < 0.05). The remineralization capacity of WSL was variable among the cases and subjects , and depended on the WSLs history , etiology ( carious , non-carious , or combined lesion<symptom>) and structure ( histological pattern). Carious WSLs showed the highest remineralization potential.
