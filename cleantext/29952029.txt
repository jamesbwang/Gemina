  Role of heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen substitution in therapeutic frontiers is well established. The efforts made in this study are directed to dissect the biological significance of benzimidazole-substituted zinc phthalocyanine derivative. Its capacity to act as an anticancer agent against the 2 B-lymphoma cell lines ( low-grade and high-grade malignancy) was found out by recording florescence using Alamar blue dye. Further cytotoxic effect at the DNA level was analyzed by performing agarose gel electrophoresis. Molecular docking studies made mechanistic details crystal clear by showing potential dual binding modes employed for interaction with DNA that include minor groove binding and intercalation between bases. This advocates this derivative as potential anticancer agent and deserves further rounds of mechanistic study for its final journey to serve as a marketed drug.
