  Telomeres protect the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and are essential for cell viability. In mammals , telomere dynamics vary with life history traits ( e.g. body mass and longevity) , suggesting differential selection depending on physiological characteristics. Telomeres , in analogy to centromeric regions , also represent candidate meiotic drivers and subtelomeric DNA evolves rapidly. We analyzed the evolutionary history of mammalian genes implicated in telomere homeostasis ( TEL genes). We detected widespread positive selection and we tested two alternative hypotheses: ( i) fast evolution is driven by changes in life history traits; ( ii) a conflict with selfish DNA elements at the female meiosis represents the underlying selective pressure. By accounting for the phylogenetic relationships among mammalian species , we show that life history traits do not contribute to shape diversity of TEL genes. Conversely , the evolutionary rate of TEL genes correlates with expression levels during meiosis and episodes of positive selection across mammalian species are associated with karyotype features ( number of chromosome arms). We thus propose a telomere drive hypothesis , whereby ( sub) telomeres and telomere-binding proteins are engaged in an intra-genomic conflict similar to the one described for centromeres.
