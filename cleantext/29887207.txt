  A field study was undertaken to investigate the occurrence and toxin production of species in the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia in Namibian waters , in the extremely productive Benguela upwelling system. From surveys conducted on the R/V Mirabilis<pathogen> and the R/V! Anichab , 52 strains were morphologically determined to species level , supported by nuclear ITS rDNA data. Seven species were identified; P. australis<pathogen> , P.<pathogen> decipiens<pathogen> , P. dolorosa , P. fraudulenta , P. plurisecta , P. pungens var. cingulata , and the new species P. bucculenta F. Gai , C. K. Hedemand , N. Lundholm & Ã˜. Moestrup sp. nov.. Molecular and morphological diversity of the Namibian Pseudo-nitzschia species is discussed. Most importantly , P. bucculenta is both morphologically and phylogenetically most similar to P. dolorosa differing mainly in valve width and densities of striae , poroids and band striae as well as by four hemi-compensatory base changes in the ITS2. Morphological and molecular differences among the strains of P.<pathogen> decipiens<pathogen> suggest a temperate and a warm water subdivision. The geographical and toxigenic characteristics of the identified Pseudo-nitzschia species are described and compared to previous studies. Initial tests of toxin production in all seven species revealed production of domoic acid ( DA) in two species: one strain of P. australis<pathogen> ( 0.074 pg DA cell
