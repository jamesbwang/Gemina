  The impact of various coronary lesion<symptom> geometries on fractional flow reserve ( FFR) is poorly understood. A total of 1552 coronary lesions<symptom> in 1236 patients from a prospective Interventional Cardiology Research In-cooperation Society Fractional Flow Reserve and Intravascular Ultrasound registry were assessed using quantitative coronary angiography , intravascular ultrasound , and FFR. Computational fluid dynamics simulation was performed for theoretical validation. Patients with complex geometries , such as longitudinal eccentricity , cross-sectional eccentricity , and surface roughness , showed significantly lower FFR values. In multivariable analysis , distal longitudinal eccentricity ( adjusted odds ratio , 1.55; 95 % confidence interval , 1.04-2.87; The complex coronary lesion<symptom> geometries were independently associated with reduced FFR values. The visual-functional mismatch between coronary angiography and FFR could be partly attributable to local geometric factors. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01366404.
