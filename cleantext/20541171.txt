  In many low-resource settings around the world utilization of long-acting reversible contraception ( LARC) is low , in part due to access barriers. We sought to explore LARC utilization patterns as well as factors associated with LARC initiation by women seeking contraception in rural Guatemala from a program working to reduce contraception access barriers. We analyzed data from a program that provides family planning in six remote , primarily indigenous , villages in Guatemala with limited access to alternative health services. Methods are free and delivered directly within villages by culturally competent providers. We conducted a retrospective chart review of all 288 women who initiated a contraceptive method over a 16-month period and conducted a logistic regression to obtain adjusted odds ratios ( OR) for predictors of LARC uptake. Overall 79.2 % of women elected a LARC method. More than half of women ( 49.8 %) switched to LARC from short-acting hormonal methods. In the univariate analysis prior use of short-acting method ( p = 0.014) , number of prior methods ( p = 0.049) , and current contraceptive use ( p < 0.01) were significantly associated with choosing a LARC. In the logistic regression model current use of contraception remained significant ( OR 3.29 , 95 % CI 1.67-8.04). Report of abnormal bleeding or other side effects from prior short-acting method use did not predict LARC uptake ( p = 0.82 and p = 0.079). Most women in this marginalized population opted for a LARC method. Low utilization of LARCs may be related to service delivery factors. Further research is needed to validate these conclusions prospectively and in less selected populations.
