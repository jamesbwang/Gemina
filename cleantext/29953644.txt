  To test a kind of stretch pattern which is the optimum stress parameter to promote human urothelial cells ( HUCs) proliferation , and to investigate the roles of integrin subunits and their pathway in the HUCs proliferation induced by physiological stretch. HUCs were seeded on silicone membrane , and subjected to four kinds of stretch ( 0,5 % ,10 % ,15 % elongation) for 24 h , as controlled by a BioDynamic The proliferation of HUCs were highest in the 5 % elongation group compared to static control , 10 % and 15 % elongation group. RT-PCR and western blot showed that 5 % cyclic stretch significantly promoted the expression of integrin α6 and FAK. The stretch-induced cell proliferation and FAK expression was inhibited by siRNA of integrin α6. Further study with FAK inhibitor revealed that elongation promoted proliferation though integrin α6 and FAK signaling pathway. Physiological stretch induced HUCs proliferation via integrin α6-FAK signaling pathway , and 5 % elongation may be the optimal stress parameter to promote the cell proliferation.
