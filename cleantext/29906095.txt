  The present work has explored bioactive glass nanoparticles ( BGNPs) and developed strontium-doped nanoparticles ( BGNPsSr) , envisioning orthopedic strategies compatible with vascularization. The nanoparticles were synthesized by the sol-gel method , achieving a diameter of 55 nm for BGNPs and 75 nm for BGNPsSr , and the inclusion of strontium caused no structural alteration. The nanoparticles exhibited high cytocompatibility for human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) and SaOS-2. Additionally , the incorporation of strontium emphasized the tubule networking behavior of HUVECs. Our results demonstrate that the nanoparticle dissolution products encouraged the osteogenic differentiation of human adipose stem cells as it favored the expression of key genes and proteins associated with osteogenic lineage. This effect was markedly enhanced for BGNPsSr , which could prompt stem cell osteogenic differentiation without the typical osteogenic inducers. This study not only supports the hypothesis that BGNPs might play a significant role in osteogenic commitment but also highlights that the designed BGNPsSr is a valuable tool for stem cell `` tune-up '' in bone tissue engineering applications.
