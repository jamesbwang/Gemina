  Lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs) are nearly immortalized B lymphocytes that are used as long-lasting supply of human cells for studies on gene expression analyses. However , studies on the stability of the cellular features of LCLs are scarce. To address this issue , we measured gene expression in LCLs with different passage numbers and observed that gene expression substantially changed within 10 passages. In particular , the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH) , a well-known housekeeping gene , varied considerably during subculture; thus , the use GAPDH as an internal control may be unsuitable. In conclusion , this study highlights the need for exercising caution during determination of gene expression in LCLs.
