  Microbial communities are important for the health of mucosal tissues. Traditional culture and gene sequencing have demonstrated bacterial populations on the conjunctiva. However , it remains unclear if the cornea , a transparent tissue critical for vision , also hosts a microbiome. Corneas<symptom> of wild-type , IL-1R (-/-) and MyD88 (-/-) C57BL/6 mice were imaged after labeling with alkyne-functionalized D-alanine ( alkDala) , a probe that only incorporates into the peptidoglycan of metabolically active bacteria.
