  We combine first principles calculations with a group theory analysis to investigate topological phase transitions in the stacking of SnTe monolayers. We show that distinct finite stacking yields different symmetry-imposed degeneracy , which dictates the hybridization properties of opposite surface states. For SnTe aligned along the ( 001) direction , an ( even) odd number of monolayers yields a ( non) symmorphic space group. For the symmorphic case , the hybridization of surface states lead to band inversions and topological phase transitions as the sample height is reduced. In contrast , for a nonsymmorphic stacking , an extra degeneracy is guaranteed by symmetry , thus avoiding the hybridization and topological phase transitions , even in the limit of a few monolayers. Our group theory analysis provide a clear picture for this phenomenology and matches well the first principles calculations.
