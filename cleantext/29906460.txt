  Leishmania<pathogen> promastigotes have the ability to synthesize essential polyunsaturated fatty acids de novo and can grow in lipid free media. Recently , we have shown that NAD ( P) H cytochrome b5 oxidoreductase ( Ncb5or) enzyme in Leishmania acts as the redox partner for Δ12 fatty acid desaturase , which catalyses the conversion of oleate to linoleate. So far , the exact role of Leishmania<pathogen> derived linoleate synthesis is still incomplete in the literature. The viability assay by flow cytometry as well as microscopic studies suggests that linoleate is an absolute requirement for Leishmania<pathogen> promastigote survival in delipidated media. Western blot analysis suggested that infection with log phase linoleate deficient mutant ( KO) results in increased level of NF-κBp65 , IκB and IKKβ phosphorylation in RAW264 .7 cells. Similarly , the log phase KO infected RAW264 .7 cells show dramatic increment of COX-2 expression and TNF-α secretion , compared to control or Ncb5or complement ( CM) cell lines. The activation of inflammatory signaling pathways by KO mutant is significantly reduced when the RAW264 .7 cells are pre-treated with BSA bound linoleate. Together , these findings confirmed that the leishmanial linoleate inhibits both COX-2 and TNF-α expression in macrophage via the inactivation of NF-κB signaling pathway. The stationary phase of KO promastigotes shows avirulence after infection in macrophages as well as inoculation into BALB/c mice; whereas CM cell lines show virulence. Collectively , these data provide strong evidence that de novo linoleate synthesis in Leishmania is an essential for parasite survival at extracellular promastigote stage as well as intracellular amastigote stage.
