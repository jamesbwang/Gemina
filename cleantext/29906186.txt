  If quark matter is energetically favored over nuclear matter at zero temperature and pressure , then it has long been expected to take the form of strange quark matter ( SQM) , with comparable amounts of u , d , and s quarks. The possibility of quark matter with only u and d quarks ( udQM) is usually dismissed because of the observed stability of ordinary nuclei. However , we find that udQM generally has lower bulk energy per baryon than normal nuclei and SQM. This emerges in a phenomenological model that describes the spectra of the lightest pseudoscalar and scalar meson nonets. Taking into account the finite size effects , udQM can be the ground state of baryonic matter only for baryon number A > A _ ( min) with A _ ( min) â‰³ 300. This ensures the stability of ordinary nuclei and points to a new form of stable matter just beyond the periodic table.
