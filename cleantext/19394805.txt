  Detection of substrate vibrations is an evolutionarily old sensory modality and is important for predator detection as well as for intraspecific communication. In insects , substrate vibrations are detected mainly by scolopidial ( chordotonal) sense organs found at different sites in the legs. Among these sense organs , the tibial subgenual organ ( SGO) is one of the most sensitive sensors. The neuroanatomy and physiology of vibratory sense organs of cicadas is not well known. Here , we investigated the leg<symptom> nerve by neuronal tracing and summed nerve recordings. Tracing with Neurobiotin revealed that the cicada Okanagana rimosa ( Say) ( Hemiptera: Cicadidae) has a femoral chordotonal organ with about 20 sensory cells and a tibial SGO with two sensory cells. Recordings from the leg<symptom> nerve show that the vibrational response is broadly tuned with a threshold of about 1 m/s2 and a minimum latency of about 6 ms. The vibratory sense of cicadas might be used in predator avoidance and intraspecific communication , although no tuning to the peak frequency of the calling song ( 9 kHz) could be found.
