  Although endogenous oestradiol , generally considered as the female hormone , has been little investigated in men , it could play a role in men 's health , mortality in particular. The influence of oestrogen receptors ( ER) genetic polymorphisms on this relationship has never been studied. The Three-City cohort study included ( 1999-2001) 3650 men ≥ 65 years who were followed for mortality over 12 years. At baseline , total oestradiol ( tE2) was measured and ER genotyped in a random subsample of 472 men without hormonal treatment. Free oestradiol ( fE2) was estimated using Vermeulen and Södergard algorithms. Mortality data were obtained from death certificates. We used inverse probability weighted Cox models to examine the association of oestradiol with all-cause and cause-specific mortality and its interaction with ER genetic polymorphisms. A total of 183 men died over the follow-up ( cardiovascular disease ( CVD) , n = 44; cancer , n = 57; other causes , n = 82). After adjustment , there was a quadratic relationship of all-cause mortality with tE2 and fE2 ( P-quadratic = 0.04 and 0.05 , respectively) , with higher mortality for the top and bottom tertiles compared to the middle one. These associations were stronger for CVD mortality ( P-quadratic = 0.01 and 0.02 for tE2 and fE2 , respectively) and disappeared for cancer mortality. There was no evidence of an interaction of oestradiol with any ER polymorphisms on all-cause mortality. In elderly men , we showed a nonlinear association of tE2 and fE2 with all-cause mortality. These quadratic relationships were stronger for CVD mortality and did not exist for cancer mortality. ER genetic polymorphisms did not modify this association.
