  The cross-coupling of α-aminoalkyltrifluoroborates and Grignard reagents to form N , N-substituted α-tertiary amines ( ATAs) is reported. Key to the success of this reaction is the unexpected oxidation of the α-aminoalkyltrifluoroborate to the corresponding iminium cation by commercially available Barluenga 's reagent. Various Grignard reagents added smoothly , enabling the synthesis of a variety of ATAs , which are of high value for medicinal chemistry and drug development. Many of the reported examples are not accessible by the established methods.
