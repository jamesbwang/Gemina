  Our primary objective was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of high dose opioid users among older adults. Study populations included adults ≥ 65 years with: 1) 12-month continuous medical plan enrollment; and 2) at least 2 opioid prescriptions with a cumulative day supply ≥ 15 days. Opioid users were categorized as high dose > 120 milligram morphine equivalents ( MME) per day or lower dose ≤ 120 MMEs per day. Among eligible insureds , 3 % ( N = 7616) were identified as high dose opioid users. Compared to lower dose users , high dose opioid users were male , younger , depressed , in poorer health , had back pain , used benzodiazepines and/or sleep medications , and used 4 or more pharmacies. The prevalence of high dose opioid users was relatively small but users were characterized by a complex mix of physical and mental health issues. Interventions to reduce reliance on opioids may need mental health management to promote more effective pain management.
