  InGaAs is one of the III-V active semiconductors used in modern high-electron-mobility transistors or high-speed electronics. ZnO is a good candidate material to be inserted as a tunneling insulator layer at the metal-semiconductor junction. A key consideration in many modern devices is the atomic structure of the hetero-interface , which often ultimately governs the electronic or chemical process of interest. Here , a complementary suite of in situ synchrotron X-ray techniques ( fluorescence , reflectivity and absorption) as well as modeling is used to investigate both structural and chemical evolution during the initial growth of ZnO by atomic layer deposition ( ALD) on In0 .53 Ga0 .47 As substrates. Prior to steady-state growth behavior , we discover a transient regime characterized by two stages. First , substrate-inhibited ZnO growth takes place on InGaAs terraces. This leads eventually to the formation of a 1 nm-thick , two-dimensional ( 2D) amorphous layer. Second , the growth behavior and its modeling suggest the occurrence of dense island<disease> formation , with an aspect ratio and surface roughness that depends sensitively on the growth condition. Finally , ZnO ALD on In0 .53 Ga0 .47 As is characterized by 2D steady-state growth with a linear growth rate of 0.21 nm cy-1 , as expected for layer-by-layer ZnO ALD.
