  Increasing the rate of exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF) to 50 % in the first six months of life is one of six major global targets set by the United Nations Decade of Nutrition , and is essential to achieve the sustainable development goals to eradicate hunger and end malnutrition by 2030. A survey using multistage random sampling design included 99 primary health care ( PHC) clinics in all 11 districts in KwaZulu-Natal ( KZN). All mothers and caregivers of infants 14 weeks of age attending the clinics in the study period were requested to participate in a structured interview to explore feeding practices since birth. As non-maternal caregivers may not have detailed knowledge of feeding practices , they provided limited information about current feeding practices. Respondents who consistently reported giving no other food or fluids except breastmilk since birth were classified as practising exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF) , and those who were currently breastfeeding but had given other food or fluids since birth were categorised as practising mixed breastfeeding ( MBF). A total of 4172 interviews were conducted with mothers and caregivers of 14 week old infants. Among mothers 49.8 % were EBF , 23.1 % were MBF and 27.0 % were not breastfeeding. Among non-maternal caregivers 11.8 % reported EBF , 23.4 % MBF and 62.3 % were not giving breastmilk. Higher education ( OR 0.6 , 95 % CI 0.4-0.8) and being in the highest socio-economic tertile ( OR 0.7 , 95 % CI 0.6-0.9) were risk factors for not practising EBF , while returning to work ( OR 0.3 , 95 % CI 0.2-0.3) or school ( OR 0.2 95 % CI , 0.1-0.3) was associated with less EBF. HIV-positive mothers were more likely to have never started breastfeeding ( OR 3.6 , 95 % CI 2.7-4.8). However , they were similar in having stopped breastfeeding by 14 weeks ( OR 1.1 , 95 % CI 0.9-1.4) compared to HIV-negative mothers , and , they had similar rates of EBF at 14 weeks of age ( OR 1.0 , 95 % CI 0.9-1.3). Estimates of breastfeeding practices at 14 weeks in KZN are higher than previously shown. However , particular challenges that should be addressed if international targets for EBF are to be achieved include improving breastfeeding practices of HIV<pathogen> positive mothers and supporting all mothers , particularly working or schooling mothers to continue giving breastmilk while they are away from their children.
