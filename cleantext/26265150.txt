  Filter-no reflow ( FNR) is a phenomenon wherein flow improves after the retrieve of distal protection. Near-infrared spectroscopy with intravascular ultrasound ( NIRS-IVUS) enables lipid detection. We evaluated the predictors of FNR during PCI using NIRS-IVUS. Thirty-two patients who underwent PCI using the Filtrap ® for acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) were enrolled. The culprit plaque ( CP) was observed using NIRS-IVUS. Total lipid-core burden index ( T-LCBI) and maximal LCBI over any 4-mm segment ( max-LCBI4mm) within CP were evaluated. T-LCBI/max-LCBI 4 mm ratio within CP was calculated as an index of the extent of longitudinal lipid expansion. The attenuation grade ( AG) and remodeling index ( RI) in CP were analyzed. AG was scored based on the extent of attenuation occupying the number of quadrants. The patients were divided into FNR group ( N = 8) and no-FNR group ( N = 24). AG was significantly higher in FNR group than in no-FNR group ( 1.6 ± 0.6 vs. 0.9 ± 0.42 , p = 0.01). RI in FNR group tended to be greater than in no-FNR group. T-LCBI/max-LCBI 4 mm ratio within the culprit plaque was significantly higher in FNR group than in no-FNR group ( 0.50 ± 0.10 vs. 0.33 ± 0.13 , p < 0.01). In multivariate logistic regression analysis , AG > 1.04 ( odds ratio ( OR) 18.4 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.5-215.7 , p = 0.02) and T-LCBI/max-LCBI 4 mm ratio > 0.42 ( OR 14.4 , 95 % CI 1.2-176.8 , p = 0.03) were independent predictors for the occurrence of FNR. The use of T-LCBI/max-LCBI 4 mm ratio within CP might be an effective marker to predict FNR during PCI in patients with ACS.
