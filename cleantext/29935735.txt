  Unloader braces are one non-invasive treatment of knee osteoarthritis , which primarily function by applying an external abduction moment to the joint<symptom> to reduce loads in the medial compartment of the knee. We developed a novel method using brace deflection to estimate the mechanical effect of valgus braces and validated this model using strain gauge instrumentation. Three subjects performed static and walking trials , in which the moment applied by an instrumented brace was calculated using the deflection and strain methods. The deflection method predicted average brace moments of 8.7 Nm across static trials; mean error between the deflection model predictions and the gold-standard strain gauge measurements was 0.32 Nm. Mean brace moment predictions throughout gait ranged from 7.1 to 8.7 Nm using the deflection model. Maximum differences ( MAE) over the gait cycle in mean and peak brace moments between methods were 1.50 Nm ( 0.96) and 0.60 Nm ( 0.42). Our proposed method enables quantification of brace abduction moments without the use of custom instrumentation. While the deflection-based method is similar to that implemented by Schmalz et al. ( 2010) , the proposed method isolates abduction deflection from the 3 DOF angular changes that occur within the brace. Though the model should be viewed with more caution during swing ( MAE = 1.16 Nm) , it was shown that the accuracy is influenced by the uncertainty in angle measurement due to cluster spacing. In conclusion , the results demonstrate that the deflection-based method developed can predict comparable brace moments to those of the previously established strain method.
