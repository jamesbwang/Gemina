  Mendelian disorders of cholesterol biosynthesis typically result in multi-system clinical phenotypes , underlining the importance of cholesterol in embryogenesis and development. FDFT1 encodes for an evolutionarily conserved enzyme , squalene synthase ( SS , farnesyl-pyrophosphate farnesyl-transferase 1) , which catalyzes the first committed step in cholesterol biosynthesis. We report three individuals with profound developmental delay , brain abnormalities , 2-3 syndactyly of the toes , and facial dysmorphisms , resembling Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome<disease> , the most common cholesterol biogenesis defect. The metabolite profile in plasma and urine suggested that their defect was at the level of squalene synthase. Whole-exome sequencing was used to identify recessive disease-causing variants in FDFT1. Functional characterization of one variant demonstrated a partial splicing defect and altered promoter and/or enhancer activity , reflecting essential mechanisms for regulating cholesterol biosynthesis/uptake in steady state.
