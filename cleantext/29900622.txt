  Supramolecular gels made from 2D building blocks are emerging as one of the novel multifunctional soft materials for various applications. This study reports on a class of supramolecular nanosheet gels formed through a reversible self-assembly process involving both intramolecular folding and intermolecular self-assembly of poly ( oligo ( ethylene glycol)- co- ( phenyl-capped bithiophenes)). Such hierarchical self-assembled structure allows the gels to switch between sol and gel states under either redox or thermostimulus. Moreover , the gels illustrate high Young 's moduli , compared to their controls that are made from the same oligo ( ethylene glycol) and phenyl-capped bithiophenes blocks but have highly covalent-crosslinked structures. The example might open a window for emerging supramolecular 2D materials to develop mechanically robust and stimuli-responsive soft materials without compromising their intrinsic functions.
