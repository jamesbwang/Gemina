  Prosthetic valve endocarditis<disease> is a major diagnostic challenge in clinical practice , due to the lower sensitivity of the modified Duke criteria and a higher percentage of cases with negative or inconclusive echocardiography results. The delay in establishing medical and surgical treatment increases the morbidity/mortality rate. New imaging techniques and 18F-FDG PET/CT in particular have meant a significant advance in cases of high clinical suspicion and negative or inconclusive echocardiography , increasing the overall sensitivity of the modified Duke criteria. We report the case of a male patient with prosthetic valve endocarditis<disease> , where 18F-FDG PET/CT provided the diagnostic key , determining the origin of the endocarditis<disease> and avoiding treatment delay.
