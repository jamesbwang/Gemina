  Alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP) is a useful tumor marker for ovarian germ cell tumors , particularly yolk sac tumor ( YST). It is valuable for both diagnosis and further follow-up. Epithelial ovarian carcinoma ( EOC) rarely secretes AFP , especially for clear cell type and in the postmenopausal women. Based on the limited knowledge about AFP-producing clear cell type EOC , a case and literature review on this topic is extensively reviewed. We report a 55-year-old postmenopausal woman experienced vaginal spotting for one month , and serum level of AFP was 60,721 ng/ml initially. Histological examination was clear cell type EOC. Tumor cells revealed strong immunoreactivity for glypican-3 ( GPC3) and AFP and weak for hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta ( HNF-1 beta) , but negative for CD30 , making the diagnosis of AFP-producing clear cell type EOC with fetal gut differentiation in focal areas , FIGO ( International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) IIIc. Although the patient underwent an intensive treatment , including optimal debulking surgery and multi-agent chemotherapy , the patient died of disease. To provide a better understanding of clinical and molecular characteristics of the AFP-producing clear cell type EOC , we conducted a systematic literature review. A total of three papers described the AFP-producing clear cell type EOC are available. The overall survival rate of these cases , including the current case is 50 %. Although immunohistochemical examination is not always needed in routine for the diagnosis of clear cell type EOC , to distinguish from other tumors , especially germ cell tumors , or to provide the better way to monitor therapeutic response or to evaluate the disease status , immunostaining , including GPC3 , HNF-1 beta , CD30 , cytokeratin 7 or 20 , and AFP is taken into account. Due to rarity , the appropriate chemotherapy regimen and the biological behavior of AFP-producing clear cell type EOC are still unclear.
