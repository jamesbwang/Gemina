  In some quarters within philosophy of medicine , more particularly in the phenomenological approaches , naturalism is looked upon with suspicion. This paper argues , first , that it is necessary to distinguish between two expressions of this attitude towards naturalism: phenomenological approaches to illness disagree with naturalism regarding various theoretical claims and they disapprove of naturalism on an ethical level. Second , this paper argues that both the disagreement with and the disapproval of naturalism are to a large extent confused. It then offers some proposals to set up an agenda for future collaboration.
