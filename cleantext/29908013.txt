  While increased rheumatic disease activity during pregnancy has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes , this activity is typically assessed by the physician. Little is known , however , about the association between patient-reported measures of disease activity and pregnancy outcomes. Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to assess the relationship between patient and physician-reported measures of disease activity and adverse pregnancy outcomes in 225 patients with lupus or rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) enrolled in a prospective registry at a single academic center from 2008-2016. In women with RA , patient-reported disease activity is associated with preterm birth ( OR 5.9 ( 1.5-23.9)) , and gestational age ( beta -1.5 weeks ( -2.6 , -0.4 weeks)). The physician assessment of disease activity also predicted preterm ( OR 2.1 ( 1.2-3.5)) , small for gestational age births ( OR 1.8 ( 1.03-3.1) , and gestational age in weeks ( beta -0.6 weeks ( -0.9 , -0.02 weeks)). On the other hand , SLE patient-reported disease activity measures , including the HAQ , pain or global health measures , are not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However , physician measures of SLE disease activity are associated with preterm birth ( OR 2.9 ( 1.-6.3)) , cesarean delivery ( OR 2.3 ( 1.0-5.3)) , and preeclampsia ( OR 2.8 ( 1.3-6.3)). The results do not appear to be driven by lupus nephritis or antiphospholipid syndrome<disease>. For women with RA , patient-reported measures of disease activity may be useful adjuncts to physician-reported measures in identifying pregnancies at greater risk. In contrast , in SLE , no patient-reported measures were associated with adverse outcomes while physician measures of disease activity helped predict several adverse pregnancy outcomes.
