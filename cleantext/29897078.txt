  Femtosecond laser ablation of solids is known to produce ejection of material to a large extent composed of particles of nanometer dimensions for a broad variety of targets. This work explores the ultrashort laser ablation of metal targets ( Ag , Cu , Al , Mn) through non-conventional diagnostics based on the nonlinear response of the transient medium created upon ablation. The full temporal mapping of the nonlinear response constitutes a useful flag that signals the abundance of clusters and nanoparticles in the plume. The use of this method for diagnosis has allowed us to perform direct observation of middle-sized aggregates that are extremely elusive with other techniques. Additionally , one crucial and seldom explored parameter in this context has been identified: the ablation laser spot size. Optimum conditions for overall nanoparticle generation as well as relative nanoparticle/cluster/atom ratios have been found.
