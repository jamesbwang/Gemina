  Macrophage-conditioned medium ( MCM) is an important cell culture supplement used to support the survival and growth of newly fused hybridoma cells. The use of macrophage cells , as a part of hybridoma technology , has proven to be an effective and inexpensive source of growth factors that promote the early survival and growth of hybridoma cells. Despite the widespread use of MCM as a hybridoma culture supplement , there is limited guidance and standardization for MCM production to achieve optimal hybridoma support. As an undefined supplement , significant variations in production of MCM may negatively impact hybridoma cell survival and growth. The lack of an available method for standardization of MCM bioactivity has limited validation , optimization , and commercial production. Consequently , variations in batch production of MCM may result in low-quality MCM that limits hybridoma viability and negatively impacts monoclonal antibody production. In this report , we describe a novel bioassay based on the newly generated , MCM-dependent RMH359 hybridoma cell line that can be used to validate MCM bioactivity and standardize production. We demonstrate the utility of the RMH359 bioassay ( 1) for evaluating MCM hybridoma bioactivity , ( 2) to define optimal conditions for production of MCM , and ( 3) as a method for MCM validation and standardization. In conclusion , the RMH359 cell bioassay provides a specific and sensitive assessment of MCM bioactivity in support of hybridoma cell survival and growth.
