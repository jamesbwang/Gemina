  To compare narrative skills between fourth and fifth grades of Persian-speaking students with hearing impairments and typical hearing students of the same grade and also to evaluate the effects of group , sex , hearing age , and educational grade of the students on their spoken/written narrative performance. The subjects were 174 students aged 10-13 years , 54 of whom wore cochlear implants , 60 suffered from moderate to severe hearing losses and wore hearing aids , with the remaining 60 students being typical hearing in terms of the sense of hearing. The micro- and macrostructure components of spoken and written narrative were elicited from a pictorial story ( The Playful Little Elephant) and then scored by raters. Compared to the typical hearing , the students with hearing impairments had significantly lower scores in all of the microstructure components of narratives. However , the findings showed no significant difference among different groups in macrostructure components of narratives. It was also revealed that the students had equal performance in spoken and written narrative. Finally , factor analysis manifested that group , sex , hearing age , and educational level of children might alter the outcome measures in various interactions. Although cochlear implantation was more effective than hearing aid on spoken and written narrative skills , the Persian-speaking students with hearing impairments were seen to need additional trainings on microstructure components of spoken/written narrative.
