  This article reports mid-term results of 41 patients treated by the stent assisted balloon induced intimal disruption and relamination ( STABILISE) technique for acute type B aortic dissection. Between November 2011 and November 2017 , 41 patients ( 10 male; median age 50 years) underwent proximal descending aortic stent grafting plus stent assisted balloon induced intimal disruption of the thoraco-abdominal aorta for acute type B aortic dissection. Serial computed tomography angiography was used to assess aortic remodelling. There were no intra-procedural complications. Fifteen branch arteries supplied by the false lumen were stented ( 9 % of the visceral branch arteries). The thirty day incidence of death , stroke , and paralysis/visceral ischaemia was 2 % ( n = 1) , 0 % , 5 % ( n = 2) , and 2 % ( n = 1) respectively. During a median follow up of 12 months ( range 1-168) eight patients ( 20 %) required re-intervention. Primary visceral stent patency was 93 % ( n = 14). No aortic related deaths occurred. On the most recent computed tomography angiogram , complete false lumen obliteration and aortic remodelling was obtained in all patients at the thoraco-abdominal level , and in 39 % ( n = 16) at the unstented infrarenal aorto-iliac level. The maximum aortic diameter increased in only two patients ( 5 %) at the unstented infrarenal level. To obtain immediate and durable thoraco-abdominal aortic remodelling in acute type B dissections , the STABILISE technique is safe and reproducible while not compromising the patency of collateral branches.
