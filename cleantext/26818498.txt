  Organization of microtubules into ordered arrays is best understood in mitotic systems , but remains poorly characterized in postmitotic cells such as neurons. By analyzing the cycling cell microtubule cytoskeleton proteome through expression profiling and targeted RNAi screening for candidates with roles in neurons , we have identified the mitotic kinase NEK7. We show that NEK7 regulates dendrite morphogenesis in vitro and in vivo. NEK7 kinase activity is required for dendrite growth and branching , as well as spine formation and morphology. NEK7 regulates these processes in part through phosphorylation of the kinesin Eg5/KIF11 , promoting its accumulation on microtubules in distal dendrites. Here , Eg5 limits retrograde microtubule polymerization , which is inhibitory to dendrite growth and branching. Eg5 exerts this effect through microtubule stabilization , independent of its motor activity. This work establishes NEK7 as a general regulator of the microtubule cytoskeleton , controlling essential processes in both mitotic cells and postmitotic neurons.
