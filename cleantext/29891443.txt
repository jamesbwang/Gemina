  Hospitals are increasingly shifting toward value-based reimbursement and focusing on cost consciousness<symptom> and patient experience. These concepts are crucial to high-quality , affordable healthcare. However , physicians are not well-trained in factoring cost and patient experience into clinical decisions. The addition of these ideas may create the opportunity for patient harm by depriving patients of necessary care. We discuss ways for physicians to mitigate this risk by engaging in online high value care curricula , using a `` 5-Question High Value Care Time Out , '' getting mentorship from master clinicians and using clinical decision support tools.
