  For three complex chemical reactions displaying intricate dynamics , we assess the effectiveness of a recently proposed quantitative method to forecast bursting and large spikes , i.e. extreme events. Specifically , we consider predicting extreme events in ( i) a copper dissolution model where Bassett and Hudson experimentally observed homoclinic ( Shilnikov) chaos , ( ii) a model derived from the mass action law of chemical kinetics , and ( iii) an autocatalator model. For these systems , we describe how the alignment of Lyapunov vectors can be used to predict the imminence of large-amplitude events and the onset of complex dynamics in chaotic time-series of observables.
