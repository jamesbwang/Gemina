  Facial sexual dimorphism has widely demonstrated as having an influence on the facial attractiveness and social interactions. However , earlier studies show inconsistent results on the effect of sexual dimorphism on facial attractiveness judgments. Previous studies suggest that the level of attractiveness might work as a moderating variable among the relationship between sexual dimorphism and facial preference and have often focused on the effect of sexual dimorphism on general attractiveness ratings , rather than concentrating on trustworthiness perception. Male and female participants viewed target male and female faces that varied on attractiveness ( more attractive or less attractive) and sexual dimorphism ( masculine or feminine). Participants rated the attractiveness of the faces and reported how much money they would give to the target person as a measure of trust. For the facial attractiveness ratings , ( a) both men and women participants preferred masculine male faces to feminine male ones under the more attractive condition , whereas preferred feminine male faces to masculine male ones under the less attractive condition; ( b) all participants preferred feminine female faces to masculine female ones under the less attractive condition , while there were no differences between feminine female faces and masculine female faces under the more attractive condition. For the target trustworthiness perception , ( a) participants showed no preference between masculine male faces and feminine male faces , neither under the more attractive condition nor the less attractiveness condition; ( b) however , all the participants preferred masculine female faces over feminine female faces under the more attractive condition , exhibiting no preference between feminine female faces and masculine female faces under the less attractive condition. These findings suggest that the attractiveness of facial stimulus may be a reason to interpret the inconsistent results from the previous studies , which focused on the effect of facial sexual dimorphism on the facial attractiveness. Furthermore , implications about the effect of target facial sexual dimorphism on participants ' trustworthiness perception were discussed.
