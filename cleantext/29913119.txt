  Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) have the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts and chondrocytes. In vitro osteogenic differentiation is critical but the molecular mechanism has yet to be further clarified. The role of TGF-β activated kinase 1 ( TAK1) in MSCs osteogenesis differentiation has not been reported. By adding si-TAK1 and rhTAK1 , the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was measured. Expression levels of the osteoblastic marker genes during osteogenic differentiation of MSCs were checked. As well as molecules involved in BMP and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. The phosphorylation of p38 and JNK was also checked. TAK1 is essential for mineralization of MSCs at low concentration , but excessive rhTAK1 inhibits mineralization of MSCs. It up regulates the expression levels of bone sialoprotein ( BSP) , osteocalcin ( OSC) , Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) , and RUNX2 during osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. It can also promote TGF-β/BMP -2 gene expression and β-catenin expression , and down regulate GSK-3β expression. Meanwhile , TAK1 promotes the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK. Additionally , TAK1 up regulates the expression of BMP-2 at all concentration under the inhibition of p38 and JNK. Our results suggested that TAK1 is essential in MSCs osteogenesis differentiation , and functions as a double-edged sword , probably through regulation of β-catenin and p38/JNK.
