  Individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( ACLR) often exhibit a `` stiffened knee strategy '' or an excessively extended knee during gait , characterized by lesser knee flexion excursion and peak internal knee extension moment ( KEM). The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of real-time biofeedback ( RTBF) cuing an acute change in peak vertical ground reaction force ( vGRF) during the first 50 % of the stance phase of walking gait on: ( 1) root mean square error ( RMSE) between actual vGRF and RTBF target vGRF; ( 2) perceived difficulty; and ( 3) knee biomechanics. Acquisition and short-term recall of these outcomes were evaluated. Thirty individuals with unilateral ACLR completed 4 separate walking sessions on a force-measuring treadmill that consisted of a control ( no RTBF) and 3 experimental loading conditions using RTBF including: ( 1) 5 % vGRF increase ( high-loading) , ( 2) 5 % vGRF decrease ( low-loading) and ( 3) symmetric vGRF between limbs. Bilateral biomechanical outcomes were analyzed during the first 50 % of the stance phase , and included KEM , knee flexion excursion , peak vGRF , and instantaneous vGRF loading rate ( vGRF-LR) for each loading condition. Peak vGRF significantly increased and decreased during high-loading and low-loading , respectively compared to control loading. Instantaneous vGRF-LR , peak KEM and knee flexion excursion significantly increased during the high-loading condition compared to low-loading. Perceived difficultly and RMSE were lower during the symmetrical loading condition compared to the low-loading condition. Cuing an increase in peak vGRF may be beneficial for increasing KEM , knee flexion excursion , peak vGRF , and vGRF-LR in individuals with ACLR. Clinical Trials Number: NCT03035994.
