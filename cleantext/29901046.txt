  Two new oxyiodoplumbates , ( Pb3O ( μ3-OH) 2I2) n ( 1) and ( Pb4I4 ( μ4-L) 2) n ( 2 , H2L = ethylene glycol) , have been solvothermally synthesized and structurally characterized. 1 consists of a 1-D tenioid ( Pb3O ( μ3-OH) 2I2) n chain built up from 1-D tenioid ( Pb2O ( μ3-OH) 2) n chains decorated ( PbI2) groups , which provides a new type of oxyiodoplumbate , ( Pb3O ( μ3-OH) 2I2) n , with oxhydryl groups. 2 consists of the rare neutral tetra-nuclear ( Pb4L4) complexes and neutral 2-D ( Pb2I4) n layers , which are interconnected to generate the only example of a 3-D hybrid oxyiodoplumbate based on neutral 2-D ( Pb2I4) n layers , mainly because the reported iodoplumbate cores usually possess negative charge. The optical properties and density functional theory calculations of 1 and 2 were studied.
