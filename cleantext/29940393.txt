  A transcriptome of the Gecarcinus lateralis molting gland ( Y-organ or YO) contained 48,590 contiguous sequences ( contigs) from intermolt ( IM) , early premolt ( EP) , mid premolt ( MP) , late premolt ( LP) , and postmolt ( PM) stages. The YO is kept in the basal state in IM by molt-inhibiting hormone ( MIH)/ cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling. YO activation in EP requires down-regulation of MIH signaling and activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR)- dependent protein synthesis. Transition of the YO to the committed state in MP requires activin/transforming growth factor-beta ( TGFβ) signaling. YO repression occurs at the end of LP. A total of 28,179 contigs ( 58 %) showed molt stage-specific changes in gene expression. The largest number of differentially-expressed genes ( DEGs) were at the IM/EP ( 16,142 contigs) , LP/PM ( 18,161 contigs) , and PM/IM ( 8290 contigs) transitions. By contrast , the numbers of DEGs were 372 and 1502 contigs for the EP/MP and MP/LP transitions , respectively. DEG analysis of 23 signal transduction pathways showed significant changes in MIH , mTOR , activin/TGFβ , Notch , MAP kinase , and Wnt signaling. Down-regulation of MIH signaling genes in premolt is consistent with reduced MIH sensitivity in MP and LP. Up-regulation of mTOR signaling genes in IM and premolt stages is consistent with its role in YO activation and sustained ecdysteroidogenesis. Up-regulation of activin/TGFβ signaling genes in EP and MP is consistent with the role of a myostatin/activin-like factor in YO commitment. Notch , MAP kinase , and Wnt DEG analysis may indicate possible crosstalk with the MIH , mTOR , and activin/TGFβ pathways to integrate other inputs to control YO ecdysteroidogenesis.
