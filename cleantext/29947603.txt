  The family Baculoviridae comprises large viruses with circular dsDNA genomes ranging from 80 to 180 kbp. The virions consist of enveloped , rod-shaped nucleocapsids and are embedded in distinctive occlusion bodies measuring 0.15-5 Âµm. The occlusion bodies consist of a matrix composed of a single viral protein expressed at high levels during infection. Members of this family infect exclusively larvae of the insect orders Lepidoptera , Hymenoptera and Diptera. This is a summary of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV) Report on the taxonomy of the Baculoviridae , which is available at www.ictv.global/ report/baculoviridae.
