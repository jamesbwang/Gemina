  Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A2 ( PAPP-A2) is consistently upregulated in the placentae of pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. The causes and significance of this upregulation remain unknown , but it has been hypothesized that it is a compensatory response to improve placental growth and development. We predicted that , if the upregulation of PAPP-A2 in pregnancy complications reflects a compensatory response , then deletion of Pappa2 in mice would exacerbate the effects of a gene deletion previously reported to impair placental development: deficiency of matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP9). We crossed mice carrying deletions in Pappa2 and Mmp9 to produce pregnancies deficient in one , both , or neither of these genes. We measured pregnancy rates , number of conceptuses , fetal and placental growth , and the histological structure of the placenta. We found no evidence of reduced fertility , increased pregnancy loss , or increased fetal demise in Mmp9 Effects of Mmp9 deficiency were not exacerbated by the deletion of Pappa2. Our results do not provide evidence that upregulation of placental PAPP-A2 represents a mechanism to compensate for impaired fetal growth.
