  Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) is a common treatment option for end-stage osteoarthritis of the tibiofemoral and patellafemoral joints. Diagnosis and treatment of the painful TKA can pose a significant challenge. In this report , we present the unusual case of a patient 12 years after total knee replacement presenting with isolated proximal tibial-fibular osteoarthritis as a cause of lateral knee pain. Proximal tibiofibular osteoarthritis is not typically on the differential diagnosis for a painful TKA but can be a rare cause of lateral knee pain. Proximal tibiofibular fusion may provide relief of pain and restoration of function.
