  To explore the role of sphingomyedlin phosphodiesterase 1 ( SMPD1) gene mutations in the pathogenesis of Parkinson 's disease ( PD). For 110 Chinese patients with PD , all exons of the SMPD1 gene were sequenced , and the results were compared with reference sequence from GenBank to identify possible mutations. A novel heterozygous mutation Ex2: c. 677C > A/p. P226Q ( likely pathogenic) was identified in a patient , which resulted in substitution of Glutamic acid by Proline at position 226. In addition , two known single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) Ex1: c. 107T > C/p. V36A ( benign) and Ex6: c. 1522G > A/p. G508R ( benign) , and three previously reported SMPD1 mutations Ex2: c.T371T > G/p. L124R ( uncertain significance) , Ex2: c. 636T > C/P. ( =-RRB- ( benign) and Ex6: c. 1598C > T/p. P533L ( uncertain significance) were identified. The novel p.P226Q mutation and p.P533L mutation were predicted to have a possibly damaging effect on the structure and function of SMPD1 protein , which in turn may lead to PD. The mutation rate of the SMPD1 gene was 3.64 % among Chinese PD patients. Genetic variants of SMPD1 may increase the risk of PD.
