  We explain the rationale for metabolically adaptive radiation dose escalation in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer and describe the design of a Canadian phase II randomized trial investigating this approach. In the trial , patients are randomized to either conventional chemoradiation treatment ( 60 Gy in 30 fractions) or metabolically adaptive chemoradiation , where fluorodeoxyglucose-avid tumor sub-volumes receive an integrated boost dose to a maximum of 85 Gy in 30 fractions. The trial sample size is 78 patients , and the target population is patients with newly diagnosed , inoperable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer treated with radical intent chemoradiation. The primary objective of the trial is to determine if dose escalation to metabolically active sub-volumes will reduce 2-year local-regional failure rate from 42.3 % to 22.3 % , when compared with standard treatment. The secondary objectives are to determine the effect of dose escalation on overall survival , progression-free survival , quality of life , and rate of grade 3 to 5 toxicities.
