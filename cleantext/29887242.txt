  To prospectively implement a prostate biopsy protocol to identify high-risk patients for bleeding or infectious complications and use risk-tailored antimicrobials , patient education , and postbiopsy monitoring with the objective of reducing complications. Overall , 637 consecutive patients from June 2014 to August 2016 underwent prostate biopsy at our Veterans Affairs hospital. In the protocol cohort , patients were screened before biopsy and prophylaxis was tailored ( high risk = ceftriaxone; low risk = ciprofloxacin). Patients were also provided additional education about bleeding and monitored for up to 1-hour. We defined complications as any deviation from normal postbiopsy activities. Comparisons were made between preprotocol/postprotocol cohorts. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for admissions or complications. Median age was 67 years ( IQR: 64-69 , P = 0.29) in both groups ( pre n = 334 , post n = 303). Preprotocol , 99 % patients received ciprofloxacin; postprotocol , 86 % received ciprofloxacin and 14 % received ceftriaxone ( P < 0.001). There were no deaths in either group. There were decreased 30-day complication and hospitalization rates in the postprotocol group ( pre 15 % vs. post 8.9 % , P = 0.025; 3.3 % vs. 1.0 % , P = 0.048). Sepsis<disease> occurred in 2 patients preprotocol and no patients postprotocol. Postprotocol group was associated with decreased 30-day complications on multivariable logistic regression ( OR = 0.58 , 95 % CI: 0.35-0.95 , P = 0.031). A screening protocol before prostate biopsy is a targeted approach for selecting prophylactic antimicrobials and closer monitoring postbiopsy for bleeding. Our results suggest that the protocol has a favorable effect on complication and hospitalization rates.
