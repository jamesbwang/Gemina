  In order to prepare thermoresponsive polyurethane gels , a novel polyurethane bearing oligo ( ethylene glycol) ( OEG) as the side chain is successfully synthesized with hexamethylene diisocyanate and OEG tartrate ester. The aqueous solution of the polyurethane shows sharp and clear lower critical solution temperature behavior at 34 °C. Furthermore , a hydrogel based on the same polyurethane is also successfully prepared using glycerol as the crosslinker. This polyurethane hydrogel including 10 mol % of glycerol presents a large swelling ratio change between 4 °C and 37 °C from 250 % to 40 %.
