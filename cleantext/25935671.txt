  The synthesis of ( 2-nitrophenyl) acetyl ( NPAc)- protected glucosyl donors is described that were designed for the neighboring-group assisted glucosylation of base-labile natural products also being sensitive to hydrogenolysis. Glycosylation conditions were optimized using a trichloroacetimidate glucosyl donor , and cyclohexylmethanol and ( +)- menthol as model acceptors. The approach was then extended to a one-pot procedure for the synthesis of 1,2-
