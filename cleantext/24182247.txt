  Active colloids are an emergent class of out-of-equilibrium materials demonstrating complex collective phases and tunable functionalities. Microscopic particles energized by external fields exhibit a plethora of fascinating collective phenomena , yet mechanisms of control and manipulation of active phases often remains lacking. Here we report the emergence of unconfined macroscopic vortices in a system of ferromagnetic rollers energized by a vertical alternating magnetic field and elucidate the complex nature of a magnetic roller-vortex interactions with inert scatterers. We demonstrate that active self-organized vortices have an ability to spontaneously switch the direction of rotation and move across the surface. We reveal the capability of certain non-active particles to pin the vortex and manipulate its dynamics. Building on our findings , we demonstrate the potential of magnetic roller vortices to effectively capture and transport inert particles at the microscale.
