  Pigmented microcystic chromophobe renal cell carcinoma ( PMChRCC) is a recently described morphologic variant of ChRCC. We have identified 42 cases in 40 patients in the last 24 years. We have investigated their clinical , morphologic , immunohistochemical , and cytogenetic features. Chromosomal abnormalities of chromosomes 7 and 17 were evaluated by automated dual-color silver-enhanced in situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded tissue. Chromosomal imbalance was defined on the basis of changes in both chromosomal index and signal distribution. The main age was 60.20 years , being 34 males and 6 women. The mean tumor diameter was 4.84 cm , with 39 intrarenal tumors. Grossly , the tumors were solid with a brown dark colored. Microscopically , tumors consisted of pale and eosinophilic cells arranged in microcysts or microalveolar in a cribriform pattern; there were microcalcifications and a dark brown pigment , mostly extracellular. One case showed sarcomatoid transformation. All tumors were positive for epithelial membrane antigen ( EMA) , Claudin 7 , and E-cadherin. Monosomy of 7 and 17 chromosomes was present in 1/36 cases and 2/37 cases , respectively. Polysomy of chromosome 7 and 17 was found in 26/36 cases and in 4/37 , respectively. With a median follow-up of 74.05 months , 37 patients were alive without disease and two were alive with disease progression. PMChRCCs expand the morphologic spectrum of the ChRCC with an unusual immunohistochemical profile. Cytogenetically , they showed monosomy to chromosome ( CHR) 17 as other ChRCCs and polysomy of CHR 7 infrequent to ChRCCs. We present the probably largest series of PMCRCC , confirming their low aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom> , with exceptional sarcomatoid transformation and distant metastases.
