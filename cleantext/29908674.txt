  Genetic and environmental factors are proposed to be involved in cedar<pathogen> pollen allergy sensitization and onset. The impact of these factors will provide key information for the prevention of cedar<pathogen> pollen sensitization and allergy onset , which we investigated in this cross-sectional study. Subjects were 382 young adult volunteers who completed a self-administered questionnaire on self-reported subjective symptoms of pollinosis , physician-diagnosed pollinosis , and background factors. We also measured their serum IgE antibody titers specific for cedar<pathogen> , cypress , and mites. Factors associated with subjective symptoms , physician diagnosis , and the three specific antigens were determined using both univariate and multivariate analyses. Sensitization to cedar<pathogen> , cypress , and mites , defined as specific IgE levels of class 1 or above , was found in 78.8 % , 64.4 % , and 56.0 % of subjects , respectively. The prevalence of cedar<pathogen> pollinosis was 41.2 % based on subjective symptoms and 22.2 % based on physician diagnosis. Factors associated with increased cedar<pathogen> pollen sensitization were mite sensitization , comorbid allergic rhinitis , and family history of cedar<pathogen> pollinosis. Risk-reducing factors for cedar<pathogen> pollen sensitization were keeping a cat , number of common colds , and hours of sleep. Risk-increasing factors for both subjective pollinosis symptoms and physician-diagnosed pollinosis were comorbid allergic rhinitis and family history of cedar<pathogen> pollinosis. Sensitization to cedar<pathogen> pollen in this population was extremely high. Both common and distinct factors were associated with sensitization to pollen and with the development of pollinosis. The distinct factors were associated with sensitization to cedar<pathogen> and cypress antigens.
