  In this study , we investigated the backward free flight of a dragonfly , accelerating in a flight path inclined to the horizontal. The wing and body kinematics were reconstructed from the output of three high-speed cameras using a template-based subdivision surface reconstruction method , and numerical simulations using an immersed boundary flow solver were conducted to compute the forces and visualize the flow features. During backward flight , the dragonfly maintained an upright body posture<symptom> of approximately 90 Â° relative to the horizon. The upright body posture<symptom> was used to reorient the stroke plane and the flight force in the global frame; a mechanism known as ` force vectoring ' which was previously observed in manoeuvres of other flying animals. In addition to force vectoring , we found that while flying backward , the dragonfly flaps its wings with larger angles of attack in the upstroke ( US) when compared with forward flight. Also , the backward velocity of the body in the upright position enhances the wings ' net velocity in the US. The combined effect of the angle of attack and wing net velocity yields large aerodynamic force generation in the US , with the average magnitude of the force reaching values as high as two to three times the body<symptom> weight. Corresponding to these large forces was the presence of a strong leading edge vortex ( LEV) at the onset of US which remained attached up until wing reversal. Finally , wing-wing interaction was found to enhance the aerodynamic performance of the hindwings ( HW) during backward flight. Vorticity from the forewings ' trailing edge fed directly into the HW LEV to increase its circulation and enhance force production.
