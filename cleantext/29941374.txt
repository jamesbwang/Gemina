  A variety of plants contain cardiac glycosides. This has resulted in many of them being used to commit suicide. In southeast Asia , Cerebera odollam ( pong-pong or suicide tree) is frequently used for suicidal ingestion. Seeds , or kernels , of this plant can cause hyperkalemia , heart block , and death due to the effects of its cardiac glycosides. We describe six cases of pong-pong seed ingestion reported to US poison centers. The most common symptoms were vomiting and bradycardia<symptom>. Three patients survived and three died. All patients who died had heart block , serum digoxin levels > 1.0 ng/mL , and were treated with anti-digoxin immune FAB. Anti-digoxin immune FAB may be ineffective in a large pong-pong seed ingestion. Patients ingesting pong-pong seeds who develop a potassium level > 8.0 meq/L or have a digoxin level > 1.0 ng/mL may be at a higher risk for death. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: The apparent ease of acquiring C. odollam seeds on the Internet makes knowledge of it important , as it can be used as a means to commit suicide. The apparent failure of digoxin immune FAB to treat toxicity from pong-pong is important , as other lifesaving techniques , such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation , might be needed in severely toxic patients.
