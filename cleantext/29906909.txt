  In linear time-invariant systems acoustic reciprocity holds by the Onsager-Casimir principle of microscopic reversibility , and it can be broken only by odd external biases , nonlinearities , or time-dependent properties. Recently it was shown that one-dimensional lattices composed of a finite number of identical nonlinear cells with internal scale hierarchy and asymmetry exhibit nonreciprocity both locally and globally. Considering a single cell composed of a large scale nonlinearly coupled to a small scale , local dynamic nonreciprocity corresponds to vibration energy transfer from the large to the small scale , but absence of energy transfer ( and localization) from the small to the large scale. This has been recently proven both theoretically and experimentally. Then , considering the entire lattice , global acoustic nonreciprocity has been recently proven theoretically , corresponding to preferential energy transfer within the lattice under transient excitation applied at one of its boundaries , and absence of similar energy transfer ( and localization) when the excitation is applied at its other boundary. This work provides experimental validation of the global acoustic nonreciprocity with a one-dimensional asymmetric lattice composed of three cells , with each cell incorporating nonlinearly coupled large and small scales. Due to the intentional asymmetry of the lattice , low impulsive excitations applied to one of its boundaries result in wave transmission through the lattice , whereas when the same excitations are applied to the other end , they lead in energy localization at the boundary and absence of wave transmission. This global nonreciprocity depends critically on energy ( i.e. , the intensity of the applied impulses) , and reduced-order models recover the nonreciprocal acoustics and clarify the nonlinear mechanism generating nonreciprocity in this system.
