  Hot working is a key process in the production of superalloys; however , it may result in the formation of inclusions<disease> that affect the superalloy performance. Therefore , the effects of hot working on inclusions<disease> in a superalloy must be studied. GH4738 superalloy was manufactured , herein , by vacuum induction melting and vacuum arc remelting. Hot working was performed by unidirectional drawing , upsetting and drawing , and upsetting/drawing with radial forging. The types and distributions of inclusions<disease> after these three hot working processes and those in an original ingot were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy , energy dispersive spectroscopy , and Image-Pro Plus software. The results showed that the melting technology essentially determined the inclusion types in GH4738. Four types of inclusions<disease> were found in the experiments: TiC ⁻ TiN ⁻ Mo ⁻ S composite , TiC ⁻ TiN composite , Ce ⁻ Mo ⁻ S composite , and SiC inclusions<disease>. In the case of hot working by unidirectional drawing , the average inclusion size first decreased , and then increased from the center to the edge. In the case of upsetting and drawing , and upsetting/drawing with radial forging , the average inclusion size decreased from the center to the edge.
