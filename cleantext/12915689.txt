  Carney complex ( CNC) is a rare genetic disease. Here , we report a case of CNC and explore clinical manifestations and gene mutation studies of CNC. A male patient with CNC at the age of 16 yr was admitted to Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University in July , 2015. Although the patient had typical signs of Cushing 's syndrome<disease> , he also presented with certain rare signs of Cushing 's syndrome<disease> , such as `` freckle-like '' scattered spots of pigmentation on the face and around the lips. In addition , concomitant severe osteoporosis led to flattened vertebrae and the compression of corresponding levels of the spinal cord. Radiographic findings revealed adrenal nodular hyperplasia<disease>. Based on sequencing , 2 novel heterozygous mutations of the
