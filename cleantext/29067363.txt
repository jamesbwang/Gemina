  To overcome the limits of low adsorption capacity and the separation difficulty of solid from liquid phase for graphene oxide ( GO) , a novel nanocomposite graphene oxide-manganese oxide ( GOMO) was facilely fabricated under ultrasonic radiation. The structures and micro-morphology of the products were characterized by fourier transform infrared ( FT-IR) spectroscopy , raman shift spectroscopy , X-ray diffraction ( XRD) pattern and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM). The effect of solution pH , adsorbent dose , contact time , initial uranium concentration , ionic strength and temperature on uranium removal efficiency was studied by batch adsorption experiments. The product GOMO was used to examine the feasibility of the removal of high salt content in uranium-containing wastewater. The adsorption results were fitted using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The kinetic parameters in the adsorption process were measured and fitted. Five adsorption/desorption cycles were performed using 3 M HNO
