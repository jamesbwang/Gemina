  Like tumour cells , during intraerythrocytic stage , Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes rely completely on glucose absorption from the blood circulation for energy metabolism. Glucose is taken up by glucose transporter 1 ( GLUT1) on human red blood cells ( RBCs) and glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4) on rodent RBCs. Blood-stage parasites grow rapidly; therefore , infected red blood cells ( iRBCs) need much more glucose for energy. In previous study , WZB117 ( 2-fluoro-6- ( m-hydroxybenzoyloxy) phenyl m-hydroxybenzoate) inhibits GLUT1 by binding the exofacial sugar-binding site and inhibits the insulin-sensitive GLUT4 with greater potency than its inhibition of either GLUT1 or GLUT3. In our study , WZB117 effectively inhibit the growth of blood-stage parasites. Mechanistically , WZB117 inhibited the activity of GLUTs and perturbed the glycolysis. Therefore , decreasing the glucose level increased the redox oxidative species ( ROS) level and induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. The spleen can more easily clear apoptopic iRBCs than nonapoptotic iRBCs , effectively relieving hepatosplenomegaly. These findings provide important insights into the crucial role of glucose transporters ( GLUTs) in Plasmodium glucose uptake during intra-erythrocytic stage , as the inhibition of GLUTs block Plasmodium<pathogen> infection during the erythrocytic stage.
