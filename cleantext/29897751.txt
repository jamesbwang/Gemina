  Zein and hyaluronic acid ( HA) composite nanoparticles were self-assembly fabricated using antisolvent coprecipitation ( ASCP) method to deliver quercetagetin ( Que). FTIR , CD , and FS results revealed that electrostatic attraction , hydrogen bonding , and hydrophobic effect were the dominant driving forces among zein , Que , and HA. With the increasing of HA level , the morphological structure of zein-Que-HA complex was changed from nanoparticle ( from 100:5:5 to 100:5:20) to microgel ( from 100:5:25 to 100:5:30). The encapsulation efficiency of Que has significantly increased from 55.66 % ( zein-Que , 100:5) to 93.22 % ( zein-Que-HA , 100:5:20) , and Que in the zein-Que-HA composite nanoparticles exhibited obviously enhanced photochemical , thermal , and physical stability. After 8 months of storage ( 4 Â°C) , the retention rate of Que also up to 77.93 %. These findings interpreted that zein-HA composite nanoparticle would be an efficient delivery system for encapsulating and protecting bioactive compounds.
