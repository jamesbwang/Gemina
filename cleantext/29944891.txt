  Electroencephalography ( EEG) invariably contains extra-cranial artifacts that are commonly dealt with based on qualitative and subjective criteria. Failure to account for EEG artifacts compromises data interpretation. We have developed a quantitative and automated support vector machine ( SVM)- based algorithm to accurately classify artifactual EEG epochs in awake rodent , canine and humans subjects. An embodiment of this method also enables the determination of ` eyes open/closed ' states in human subjects. The levels of SVM accuracy for artifact classification in humans , Sprague Dawley rats and beagle dogs were 94.17 % , 83.68 % , and 85.37 % , respectively , whereas ` eyes open/closed ' states in humans were labeled with 88.60 % accuracy. Each of these results was significantly higher than chance. Other existing methods , like those dependent on Independent Component Analysis , have not been tested in non-human subjects , and require full EEG montages , instead of only single channels , as this method does. We conclude that our EEG artifact detection algorithm provides a valid and practical solution to a common problem in the quantitative analysis and assessment of EEG in pre-clinical research settings across evolutionary spectra.
