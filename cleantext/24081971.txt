  Cardiotoxicity is one of the most serious chronic complications of anthracyclines therapy. Assessment of the left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) fails to detect subtle cardiac dysfunction of left ventricular ( LV). This study aimed to detect and evaluate new parameters of subclinical anthracyclines ' cardiotoxicity in children with solid tumor. A detailed echocardiographic examination was performed in 36 children with hepatoblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma after receiving anthracyclines ' chemotherapy and 36 healthy controls from January 2015 to December 2016. The LVEF , ratio of early diastolic peak velocity of transmitral flow ( E) and septal diastolic e ' mitral annular peak velocity ( e ') , tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion ( TAPSE) , and LV global longitudinal strain ( GLS) were evaluated using M-mode , tissue Doppler imaging ( TDI) , and two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography ( 2D-STE) , respectively. Echocardiographic parameters were compared between patient group and healthy controls. All patients were divided into two subgroups based on their anthracyclines ' cumulative dosage ( < 300 mg/m All patients had no presentation of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and LVEF within normal range ( 65.7 ± 5.1 %). Compared with healthy controls , the mean E/e ' increased significantly ( 7.9 ± 0.7 vs. 10.2 ± 3.5 , t = 3.72 , P < 0.01) , mean TAPSE decreased significantly ( 17.2 ± 1.3 mm vs. 14.2 ± 3.0 mm , t = -4.03 , P < 0.01) , and mean LV GLS decreased significantly ( -22.2 % ± 1.9 % vs. -17.9 % ± 2.9 % , t = -5.58 , P < 0.01) in patient group. Compared with subgroup with anthracyclines ' cumulative dosage < 300 mg/m LV GLS is helpful in the early detection of subclinical LV dysfunction using 2D-STE. E/e ' and TAPSE are other sensitive parameters in detecting subclinical cardiac dysfunction of both ventricles by TDI. These parameters show significant change with different anthracyclines ' cumulative dosage , so cumulative dosage should be controlled in clinical treatment.
