  To determine the effectiveness and harms of bladder-preserving trimodal therapy ( TMT) as a first-line treatment versus radical cystectomy ( RC) plus radical pelvic lymphadenectomy in the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer in terms of overall survival. We included parallel clinical trials and prospective and retrospective cohort studies that included patients older than 18 years old , diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer , who underwent TMT compared with RC. The planned comparison was TMT versus RC plus pelvic lymphadenectomy as first-line treatment. The primary outcome was overall survival ( OS) and secondary outcomes were salvage cystectomy and cancer-specific survival and progression-free survival. A search strategy was designed for MEDLINE , CENTRAL , Embase , and LILACS. We saturated information with conference abstracts , in progress clinical trials , literature published in non-indexed journals , and other sources of gray literature. Standardized tools assessed the risk of bias independently. We performed the statistical analysis in R v3 .4.1 and effect sizes were reported in terms of hazard ratios ( HR) and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI). Accordingly , we used a random effect model due to the statistical heterogeneity found in included studies. We found 2682 records with the search strategies and , finally , 11 studies were included in the quantitative analysis. The summary HR for OS was 1.06 95 % CI ( 0.85-1.31) I We found no differences in overall survival and progression-free survival between these two interventions. Nonetheless , we found that cancer-specific survival favored patients who received radical cystectomy.
