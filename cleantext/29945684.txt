  We measured the disinfection of MRSA and Clostridium<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> spores using an ultraviolet C ( UV-C) device , and we correlated those results to measurements and computer simulations of UV-C surface intensity. The results demonstrate both large differences in UV light intensity across various surfaces and how this leads to significant differences in disinfection.
