  Asthma and allergies prevalence increased in recent decades , being a serious global health problem. They are complex<disease> diseases<disease> with strong contextual influence , so that the use of advanced machine learning tools such as genetic programming could be important for the understanding the causal mechanisms explaining those conditions. Here , we applied a multiobjective grammar-based genetic programming ( MGGP) to a dataset composed by 1047 subjects. The dataset contains information on the environmental , psychosocial , socioeconomics , nutritional and infectious factors collected from participating children. The objective of this work is to generate models that explain the occurrence of asthma , and two markers of allergy: presence of IgE antibody against common allergens , and skin prick test positivity for common allergens ( SPT). The average of the accuracies of the models for asthma higher in MGGP than C4 .5. IgE were higher in MGGP than in both , logistic regression and C4 .5. MGGP had levels of accuracy similar to RF , but unlike RF , MGGP was able to generate models that were easy to interpret. MGGP has shown that infections , psychosocial , nutritional , hygiene , and socioeconomic factors may be related in such an intricate way , that could be hardly detected using traditional regression based epidemiological techniques. The algorithm MGGP was implemented in c + + and is available on repository: http://bitbucket.org/ciml-ufjf/ciml-lib.
