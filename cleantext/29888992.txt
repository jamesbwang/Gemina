  Drug delivery via the rectum is a useful alternative route of administration to the oral route for patients who can not swallow. Traditional rectal dosage forms have been historically used for localized treatments including delivery of laxatives , treatment of hemorrhoids and for delivery of antipyretics. However , the recent trend is showing an increase in the development of novel rectal delivery systems to deliver drug directly into the systemic circulation by taking advantage of porto-systemic shunting. The present review is based on research studies carried out between years 1969-2017. Data for this review have been derived from keyword searches using Scopus and Medline databases. Novel rectal drug delivery systems including hollow-type suppositories , thermo-responsive and muco-adhesive liquid suppositories , and nanoparticulate systems incorporated into an appropriate vehicle have offered more control over delivery of drug molecules for local or systemic actions. In addition , various methods for in vitro-in vivo evaluation of rectal drug delivery systems are covered which is as important as the formulation , and must be carried out using appropriate methodology. Continuous research and development in this field of drug delivery may unleash the hidden potential of the rectal drug delivery systems.
