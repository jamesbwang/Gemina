  Aberrant activation of RAS signalling pathways contributes to aggressive phenotypes of cancer cells. The RAS-targeted therapies for cancer , therefore , have been recognised to be effective; however , current developments on targeting RAS have not advanced due to structural features of the RAS protein. Here , we show that expression of NRAS , a major isoform of RAS , can be controlled by photo-irradiation with an anionic phthalocyanine , ZnAPC , targeting NRAS mRNA. In vitro experiments reveal that ZnAPC binds to a G-quadruplex-forming oligonucleotide derived from the 5 '- untranslated region of NRAS mRNA even in the presence of excess double-stranded RNA , which is abundant in cells , resulting in selective cleavage of the target RNA 's G-quadruplex upon photo-irradiation. In line with these results , upon photo-irradiation , ZnAPC decreases NRAS mRNA and NRAS expression and thus viability of cancer cells. These results indicate that ZnAPC may be a prominent photosensitiser for a molecularly targeted photodynamic therapy for cancer.
