  This paper 's objective was to describe the processes , strategies , and challenges of community-based recruitment to complement hospital-based recruitment for a global clinical outcomes trial on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). To increase the subject recruitment for the clinical research , field staff were trained on community-based recruitment strategies and activities. Courtesy calls and coordination with community organizations were done before recruitment activities. House-to-house interviews using patient referral checklist , lay fora on COPD , and spirometry camps identified eligible participants in five sites in the Philippines. Of 3,202 individuals interviewed , 27 % potentially eligible were referred to hospital sites. Of 55 % who were successfully screened , 9 % were randomized. Courtesy calls and endorsements identified potential recruits. Issues related to communication , work , health condition and family members ' encouragement affected participation. Complexity of the eligibility criteria contributed to the high screen failure rates. Enabling full subject protection entitlements before informed consent taking was one of the ethical issues identified. Community-based recruitment may increase subjects for clinical trials depending on the complexity of the requirements. Adopting a community-based recruitment strategy must be decided at the planning stage for efficient coordination of activities. Social preparation should consider socio-economic and cultural factors. Current ethical guidelines and regulations indirectly address issues on community-based recruitment.
