  The aim of the study was to investigate the location of motor neuron somata of geniohyoid muscle in rat. Nine Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Operations were performed under general anaesthesia. Nembutal sodium , 40 mg per kg intraperitoneally was used for anaesthesia. 0.02 to 0.05 ml of 30 % horseradish peroxidase ( Sigma Type VI) solution in normal saline was injected into the exposed right geniohyoid muscle. After 48 hr , the animals were fixed by perfusion through left ventricle of heart , first by 100 ml normal saline and then with 500 ml of 1.25 % glutaraldehyde and 1 % paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer , pH 7.4 , at room temperature , and finally with 500 ml of 10 % sucrose in the same buffer at 4 °C. The medulla oblongata and first cervical segment of spinal cord were removed , kept in 10 % sucrose in above phosphate buffer at 4 °C for 24 hr. Thereafter , their serial transverse sections were cut in a cryostat at a thickness of 60 μm. The sections were treated according to tetramethyl benzidine ( TMB)- horseradish peroxidase ( HRP) method. HRP-labelled neuron somata were observed at the following sites: ( a) In ventral part of right main hypoglossal nucleus in upper two-thirds of the closed part of medulla oblongata. ( b) In ventrolateral subnucleus of hypoglossal nucleus in lower third of closed part of medulla oblongata. ( c) At spinomedullary junction , they were located in dorsomedial part of right ventral grey column; a few were also seen here scattered on right side of central canal and among corticospinal fibres.
