  We present a case of a 72-year-old man with submassive acute pulmonary thromboembolism. Pulmonary embolism severity index Score and common clinical risk stratification recommended systemic anticoagulation and a clinical course without complications was expected. A primary reperfusion strategy was not indicated by the current guidelines. Under established anticoagulation , the patient was found in cardiac arrest immediately after mobilisation from the bed the next morning. Right heart catheterisation under ongoing resuscitation revealed a complete obstruction of the right pulmonary artery by a big thrombus. Catheter-directed intervention trying to bypass the thrombus with interventional guidewires failed. Ultimately , the patient died from acute right heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The current case raises concern that the prediction scores available for pulmonary embolism may insufficiently predict short-term outcome in isolated patients.
