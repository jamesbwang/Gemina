  In Brazil , although a large number of animals are used in traditional medicine ( at least 354 species) , information about their biological activities is scarce. In this context , the objective of this study was to evaluate the bactericidal potential of zootherapeutic by-products from animals used in Brazilian traditional medicine and discuss the ecological and cultural consequences of such practices. The species analyzed were: Tupinambis merianae ( skin) , Iguana iguana ( skin and body fat) , Crotalus durissus ( skin and body fat) , Boa constrictor ( skin) , Euphractus sexcinctus ( body fat) and Coendou prehensilis ( quills). Experiments were performed with standard clinical strains of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( EC-ATCC10536) and Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( SA-ATCC 25923). For the microbiological assay , the zootherapeutics were evaluated using serial microdilutions. The results indicate that none of the samples possess inhibitory activity against standard bacterial strains. The in vitro ineffectiveness of the analyzed products demonstrate a necessity for new pharmacological research that encompass a large number of species of medicinal animals as well as highlight the importance of zootherapy in the context of plans for animal conservation.
