  Idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( IPF) is an agnogenic chronic disorder with high morbidity and low survival rate. Quercetin is a flavonoid found in a variety of herbs with anti-fibrosis function. In this study , bleomycin was employed to induce a pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> mouse model. The quercetin administration ameliorated bleomycin-induced pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> , evidenced by the expression level changes of hydroxyproline , fibronectin , α-smooth muscle actin , Collagen I and Collagen III. The similar results were observed in transforming growth factor ( TGF)- β-treated human embryonic lung fibroblast ( HELF). The bleomycin or TGF-β administration caused the increase of sphingosine-1-phosphate ( S1P) level in pulmonary tissue and HELF cells , as well as its activation-required kinase , sphingosine kinase 1 ( SphK1) , and its degradation enzyme , sphinogosine-1-phosphate lyase ( S1PL). However , the increase of S1P , SphK1 and S1PL was attenuated by application of quercetin. In addition , the effect of quercetin on fibrosis<disease> was abolished by the ectopic expression of SphK1. The colocalization of SphK1/S1PL and fibroblast specific protein 1 ( FSP1) suggested the roles of fibroblasts in pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease>. In summary , we demonstrated that quercetin ameliorated pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting SphK1/S1P signaling.
