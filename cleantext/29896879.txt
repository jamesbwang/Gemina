  Protein precipitates that arise during bioprocessing can cause manufacturing challenges , but they can also aid in clearance of host-cell protein ( HCP) and DNA impurities. Such precipitates differ from many protein precipitates that have been studied previously in their heterogeneous composition , particularly in the presence of high concentrations of the product protein. Here , we characterize the precipitates that form after neutralization of protein A purified and viral-inactivated material of an Fc-fusion protein produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The physical growth of precipitate particles was observed by optical microscopy , transmission electron microscopy , dynamic light scattering , and small-angle and ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering to characterize the precipitate microstructure and growth mechanism. The precipitate microstructure is well-described as a mass fractal with fractal dimension approximately 2. The growth is governed by a diffusion-limited aggregation mechanism as indicated by a power-law dependence on time of the size of the principal precipitate particles. Optical microscopy shows that these primary particles can further aggregate into larger particles in a manner that appears to be promoted by mixing. Absorbance experiments at varying pH and salt concentrations reveal that the growth is largely driven by attractive electrostatic interactions , as growth is hindered by an increase in ionic strength. The solution conditions that resulted in the most significant particle growth are also correlated with the greatest removal of soluble impurities ( DNA and HCPs). Proteomic analysis of the precipitates allows identification of O ( 100) unique HCP impurities , depending on the buffer species ( acetate or citrate) used for the viral inactivation. Most of these proteins have pI values near the precipitation pH , supporting the likely importance of electrostatic interactions in driving precipitate formation.
