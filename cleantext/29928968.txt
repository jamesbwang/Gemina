  Jonquailine , a new alkaloid recently isolated from Narcissus jonquilla quail , an Amaryllidaceae species cultivated for its flowers fragrance in Europe and USA , shows very significant anti-proliferative activity against several malignant cancer cell types. Although it was reported that this activity is related to the functionalities and to its stereochemistry at C-8 of B ring , the absolute configuration at this stereocenter was not known. Density functional theory ( DFT) calculations of chiroptical properties , namely electronic circular dichroism ( ECD) , vibrational circular dichroism ( VCD) , and optical rotatory dispersion ( ORD) are employed here to complete assignment of absolute configuration of jonquailine , and then , by extension , to its analogues pretazettine and 8-O-methylpretazettine. While ECD is not discriminating and ORD is of limited use , VCD reveals decisive in the task of absolute configuration assignment.
