  We present the case of a 46-year-old woman with sympathetic ophthalmia<disease> occurring 27 years after complicated juvenile cataract surgeries. The patient declined systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Dexamethasone implant in the sympathizing eye allowed good visual recovery up to 18 months of follow-up with a total of 6 implants. Intraocular pressure rise was controlled medically. This is a unique report of sympathetic ophthalmia<disease> treated solely with slow-release dexamethasone implant without systemic therapies.
