  Hypoxia due to rapid tumor growth with impaired neovascularization and inflammation<symptom> resulting from immune cell activation are hallmarks of cancer. Hypoxia-inducible factors control transcriptional adaptation in response to low oxygen conditions , both in tumor and immune cells. In addition , sphingolipids become increasingly recognized as important cell mediators in tumor and inflammatory hypoxia. Recent studies have identified acid sphingomyelinase ( ASM) , a central enzyme in the sphingolipid metabolism , as a regulator of several types of stress stimuli pathways and an important player in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore , this review will address the connection between the hypoxic response and the ASM/ceramide system in the context of inflammatory hypoxia.
