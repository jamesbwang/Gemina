  Extracting light from quantum dot light emitting diodes ( QLEDs) by applying optical-functional nanostructures inside and outside the devices is essential for their commercial application in illumination and displays. In this paper , we demonstrate the highly effective extraction of waveguided light from the active region of QLEDs by embedding internal grating patterns fabricated using a nanoimprint lithography technique. The grating couples out waveguide mode power into the substrate without changing the device 's electrical properties , resulting in an increase in both the external quantum efficiency and luminous efficiency for a green QLED from 11.13 % to 13.45 % , and 29010 cd m-2 to 44150 cd m-2 , respectively. The observed improvement can be ascribed to the elimination of the waveguide mode by the grating nanostructures introduced in the device. Furthermore , the finite-difference time-domain ( FDTD) simulation also demonstrated that the power loss due to the waveguide mode was reversed. The results indicate that internal nano-scattering pattern structures are attractive for enhancing the out-coupling efficiency of QLEDs.
