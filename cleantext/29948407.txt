  Glypican-4 ( GPC-4) is a novel adipomyokine that enhances insulin signaling. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D ( GPLD1) is thought to release GPC-4 and is itself an insulin-regulated enzyme. Beneficial effects of exercise training and chamomile flowers extract ( CFE) are shown through activation of PPARÎ³ , which is a promising drug target in diabetes and associated with GPC-4 synthesis. This study investigated the effects of 14-week treadmill running and CFE on serum GPC-4 , GPLD1 , and insulin levels in streptozotocin-nicotinamide ( STZ-NA)- induced diabetic rats. Thirty-two STZ-NA-induced diabetic male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups: control ( C) , training ( T) , CFE treatment ( CFE) , and training plus CFE treatment ( TCFE) groups. The training groups were exercised on treadmill 5 days/week and the treating groups were fed with 200 mg/kg/day CFE in drinking water for 14 weeks. Finally , serum GPC-4 , GPLD1 , and insulin levels were analyzed via sandwich ELISA. Compared to the control group , serum insulin levels were significantly higher in the T , CFE , and TCFE groups ( p < 0.05 , p < 0.05 , p < 0.01 , respectively) , while OGTT and serum GPLD1 levels were significantly lower in the T , CFE , and TCFE groups ( all p < 0.001). Changes in serum GPC-4 levels were not significant. Serum GPLD1 levels were negatively correlated with insulin levels and HOMA-IS ( both p < 0.001). This study suggests that endurance training and CFE may downregulate serum GPLD1 levels in STZ-NA-induced diabetic rats , which associate with the serum insulin profile. However , the results show that endurance training and CFE may not cause serum GPC-4 adaptation in STZ-NA-induced diabetic rats.
