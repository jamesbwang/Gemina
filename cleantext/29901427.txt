  Cell death and tissue injury occur as a result of radiation accidents and radiotherapy. The role of endothelial cell damage in mediating radiation-induced acute tissue injury has been extensively studied. We previously demonstrated that ferulic acid ( FA) mitigates radiation-induced hematopoietic injury in mice and lessens radiation-induced oxidative damage in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs). The purpose of the current study was to determine whether FA can protect HUVECs from radiation toxicity in a cell model via the thrombomodulin ( Thbd) pathway , an anti-radiation pathway with anticoagulant , anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. HUVEC culture media was supplemented with FA 12 h before 4 Gy
