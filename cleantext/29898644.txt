  Evolving methods of communication have increased public appeals for living organ and hematopoietic stem cell donations from strangers , giving public solicitations more visibility. Within the academic literature , perspectives have been divisive , reflecting ethical justifications for and against appeals for living unrelated donors. Transplant programs and clinicians face a variety of ethical dilemmas when patients and their solicited donors present to the hospital. A scoping review methodology was designed to ( 1) explore the academic literature and ( 2) summarize and disseminate key research findings. We used the Arksey & O'Malley framework for conducting and reporting scoping reviews and to review the prominent ethical arguments , counterarguments , and policy implications in the literature. From 4616 articles identified through MEDLINE , EMBASE , PsycInfo , and CINAHL , we screened titles and abstracts to assess eligibility for full-text review. We retrieved 280 full texts , extracted data from 61 , and coded and analyzed 41 papers. Of these , 36 were from or based in the US context. Two articles originated from Canada. Three articles addressed public solicitations of hematopoietic stem cell donation. We mapped themes under 3 major headings related to public solicitations of living unrelated donors for organs and hematopoietic stem cells: ( 1) interpretations and modes , ( 2) ethical arguments for and against , and ( 3) policy implications and suggestions to address challenges for clinical practice. The academic literature contains divisive perspectives of public solicitations for organ and hematopoietic stem cell donation , each of which deserves further reflection for implications for policy and practice.
