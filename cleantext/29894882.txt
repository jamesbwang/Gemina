  In this study , honeybees were used to determine spatio-temporal variations and origin sources of Pb. Lead concentrations and isotopic composition were used in combination with selected statistical methods. The sampling was carried out at five different locations in Serbia: urban region ( BG) , petrochemical industry ( PA) , suburban region ( PV) , rural region ( MS) and thermal power plant region ( TPP) during 2014. At PA and PV locations , samples were taken during multiple years. This is the first use of Kohonen self-organizing map ( SOM) in combination with honeybees as bioindicators to determine spatio-temporal variations and origin of Pb pollution. It was observed that during the years Pb concentrations were in decline. Anthropogenic sources are most dominant in BG and TPP , in PA there are mixed sources of natural and anthropogenic origin and in PV Pb is of natural origin. It can be concluded that honeybees in combination with SOM can be used to differentiate between slight changes in spatio-temporal variations of Pb , as well as for source appointment.
