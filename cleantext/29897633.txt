  Alcohol use disorder ( AUD) affects millions of people and costs nearly 250 billion dollars annually. Few effective FDA-approved treatments exist , and more are needed. AUDs have a strong heritability , but only a few genes have been identified with a large effect size on disease phenotype. Genomewide association studies ( GWASs) have identified common variants with low effect sizes , most of which are in noncoding regions of the genome. Animal models frequently fail to recapitulate key molecular features of neuropsychiatric disease due to the polygenic nature of the disease , partial conservation of coding regions , and significant disparity in noncoding regions. By contrast , human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs) derived from patients provide a powerful platform for evaluating genes identified by GWAS and modeling complex interactions in the human genome. hiPSCs can be differentiated into a wide variety of human cells , including neurons , glia , and hepatic cells , which are compatible with numerous functional assays and genome editing techniques. In this review , we focus on current applications and future directions of patient hiPSC-derived central nervous system cells for modeling AUDs in addition to highlighting successful applications of hiPSCs in polygenic neuropsychiatric diseases.
