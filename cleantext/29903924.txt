  Temporal encephaloceles are increasingly visualized during neuroimaging assessment of individuals with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy , and their identification could indicate an intracranial abnormality that may be related to a potential seizure<symptom> focus. Careful review by an experienced neuroradiologist may yield improved detection of TEs , and other clinical , neurophysiologic , and radiologic findings may predict their presence. Data were reviewed retrospectively in patients at our institution who were presented at a multidisciplinary conference for refractory epilepsy between January 1 , 2010 , and December 31 , 2016. Clinical , neurophysiologic , and imaging data were collected. An expert neuroradiologist reviewed the latest MR imaging of the brain in patients for whom one was available , noting the presence or absence of temporal encephaloceles as well as other associated imaging characteristics. A total of 434 patients were reviewed , 16 of whom were excluded due to unavailable or poor-quality MR imaging. Seven patients had temporal encephaloceles reported on initial imaging , while 52 patients had temporal encephaloceles identified on expert review. MR imaging findings were more often initially normal in patients with temporal encephaloceles ( Careful review of MR imaging in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy by a board-certified neuroradiologist with special attention paid to a high-resolution T2 sequence can increase the detection of subtle temporal encephaloceles , and certain clinical and neurophysiologic findings should raise the suspicion for their presence.
