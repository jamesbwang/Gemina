  The prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing at an alarming rate in Malaysia. Metabolic changes during pregnancy are critical to the development of infant adiposity , due to imbalanced adipokines production. Hence , we aimed to investigate the association of maternal serum and breast milk adipokines with infant adiposity development. The study was conducted from April 2010 until December 2012. A total of 155 healthy pregnant mothers aged 19 to 40 years were recruited during the first and second trimester in Kelantan , Malaysia. Data consisted of maternal sociodemographic details , anthropometry and clinical biochemistry analysis; and the infant & rsquo; s anthropometry and feeding patterns. Maternal fasting serum and breast milk samples were analysed for adiponectin and leptin levels. Data collection was performed in the second and third trimester of pregnancy , and continued with follow-up visits at birth , two , six , and 12 months postpartum. Multiple linear regression ( MLR) analyses were performed to examine the associations between maternal serum and breast milk adiponectin and leptin and infant adiposity development. MLR models showed that , in the first year , as maternal serum and breast milk adiponectin increased , infant weight , BMI-for-age Z scores and abdominal circumference significantly decreased (
