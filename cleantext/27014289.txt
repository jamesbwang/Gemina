  Light signaling has long been reported to influence fruit biology , although the regulatory impact of fruit-localized photoreceptors on fruit development and metabolism remains unclear. Studies performed in phytochrome ( PHY)- deficient tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum) mutants suggest that SlPHYA , SlPHYB2 , and to a lesser extent SlPHYB1 influence fruit development and ripening. By employing fruit-specific RNAi-mediated silencing of SlPHY genes , we demonstrated that fruit-localized SlPHYA and SlPHYB2 play contrasting roles in regulating plastid biogenesis and maturation in tomato. Our data revealed that fruit-localized SlPHYA , rather than SlPHYB1 or SlPHYB2 , positively influences tomato plastid differentiation and division machinery via changes in both light and cytokinin signaling-related gene expression. Fruit-localized SlPHYA and SlPHYB2 were also shown to modulate sugar metabolism in early developing fruits via overlapping , yet distinct , mechanisms involving the co-ordinated transcriptional regulation of genes related to sink strength and starch biosynthesis. Fruit-specific SlPHY silencing also drastically altered the transcriptional profile of genes encoding light-repressor proteins and carotenoid-biosynthesis regulators , leading to reduced carotenoid biosynthesis during fruit ripening. Together , our data reveal the existence of an intricate PHY-hormonal interplay during fruit development and ripening , and provide conclusive evidence on the regulation of tomato quality by fruit-localized phytochromes.
