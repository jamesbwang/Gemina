  As procedure rates and expenditures for total hip arthroplasty ( THA) rise , hospitals are developing models to predict discharge location , a major determinant of total cost. The predictive value of existing illness rating systems such as the American Society for Anesthesiologists ( ASA) Physical Classification System , Severity of Illness ( SOI) scoring system , or Mallampati ( MP) rating scale on discharge location remains unclear. This study explored the predictive role of ASA , SOI , and MP scores on discharge location , lengths of stay , and total costs for THA patients. A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing elective primary or revision THA was conducted at a single institution. Multivariable regressions were utilized to assess the significant predictive factors for lengths of stay , total costs , and discharge to skilled nursing facilities ( SNFs) , rehabilitation centers , and home. Controls included demographic factors , insurance coverage , and the type of procedure. ASA scores ≥ 3 are the only significant predictors of discharge to SNFs ( odds ratio ( OR) = 1.69 , confidence interval ( CI) = 1.04-2.74) and home ( OR = 0.57 , CI = 0.34-0.98). Medicaid coverage ( OR = 2.61 , CI = 1.37-4.96) and African-American race ( OR = 2.60 , CI = 1.59-4.25) were additional significant predictors of discharge to SNF. SOI scores are the only significant predictors of length of stay ( β = 1.36 days , CI = 0.53-2.19) and total cost for an episode ( β = $ 6,234 , CI = $ 3577- $ 8891). MP scores possess limited predictive power over lengths of stay only. These findings suggest that although ASA classifications predict discharge location and SOI scores predict length of stay and total costs , other factors beyond illness rating systems remain stronger predictors of discharge for THA patients.
