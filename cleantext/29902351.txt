  The aim of this study was to validate a Spanish version of the Caregiver Skills scale ( CASK) in a sample of eating disorder ( ED) caregivers. A further aim was to examine the concordance/discrepancy between them ( namely , between the mothers and fathers of ED patients). Two hundred sixty-five ED caregivers were recruited from ED centers in Catalonia , Spain. Confirmatory factor analyses was used to test the factorial structure of the CASK scale. Cronbach 's Î± was used to measure internal consistency of the CASK scales. A comparison of the CASK measures between respondents ( mothers and fathers) was conducted using generalized estimating equations. Confirmatory factor analysis of the Spanish version of the CASK corroborated the strong factorial validity of the 6 factors of the original CASK questionnaire. Mothers and fathers did not differ significantly on CASK overall and subscale scores. There was however less concordance between parents on the bigger picture ( ICC = 0.28) and biting your tongue ( ICC = 0.08) subscales. The CASK is a valid tool to assess ED-related attitudes in Spanish-speaking caregivers. Furthermore , caregivers and patients alike could stand to benefit from interventions focused on improving areas such as ED beliefs , effective communication , quality of life , and emotional distancing.
