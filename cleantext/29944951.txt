  RNA-Seq was applied to capture the transcriptome of the leaf and root of non-treated and salinity-treated chrysanthemum cv. ` Jinba ' plants. A total of 206,868 unigenes of mean length 849 nt and of N50 length 1363 nt was identified; of these about 64 % ( > 132,000) could be functionally assigned. Depending on the severity of the salinity stress , differential transcription was observed for genes encoding proteins involved in osmotic adjustment , in ion transport , in reactive oxygen species scavenging and in the regulation of abscisic acid ( ABA) signaling. The root stress response was dominated by the up-regulation of genes involved in ion transport and homeostasis , while that of the leaf reflected the plant 's effort to make osmotic adjustments and to regulate ABA signaling. An array of known transcription factors ( WRKY , AP2/ERF , MYB , bHLH and NAC) were differentially transcribed.
