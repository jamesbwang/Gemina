  Re-operative adrenal surgery for recurrent pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma ( PCC/PGL) is a therapeutic situation not commonly encountered. The recurrence rate of pheochromocytoma is estimated to be 6.1-16.5 % of patients from published retrospective series; there are no reports from the Asian continent. A retrospective analysis of the departmental database was performed on patients who had undergone surgery for PCC/PGL from January 2004 to December 2014 at the Christian Medical College Hospital , Vellore , India. Among 99 patients identified during the study period , there were 14 recurrent tumours and 13 patients underwent re-operative surgery. We located eight recurrences on the right side , three on the left side and three in the midline. All 14 recurrences were functioning , and the biochemical analysis as well as imaging studies were positive in 13 of them. The mean duration to recurrence from the time of the primary surgery was 76.3 months ( range 6-180 months). Of the 89 patients who underwent their first operation at our centre , 67.4 % reported for follow-up for a mean period of 25 months ( range 4-132 months). Four of these required re-operation with a recurrence rate of 4.5 % ( 4/89). The open approach was used for all but one of the recurrent tumours. Recurrence following surgery for PCC/PGL is a rarely studied though significant problem. Right adrenal tumour recurrences were most common , and all these recurrences were in the retrocaval region; this typical phenomenon may be dubbed the ` right retrocaval trap '. The reason for this was presumably due to difficult access and inadequate exposure of this area in open and laparoscopic surgery , resulting in incomplete dissection.
