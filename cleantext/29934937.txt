  Surgical treatment for glaucoma has undergone a dramatic change over the last decade. Trabeculectomy has been the main surgical procedure worldwide for almost 50 years. However , there is a growth in development of new novel devices and surgical techniques designed to lower intraocular pressure in a less invasive fashion. The term minimally invasive glaucoma surgery ( MIGS) has been coined and is the subject of investment , debate and , increasingly , research. The position of MIGS in the glaucoma treatment paradigm is yet to be clearly defined and its ability to replace conventional filtration surgery remains debatable. In this paper two glaucoma specialists were invited to debate the motion that `` MIGS is a poor substitute for trabeculectomy ''.
