  Many patients require discontinuation of benzodiazepines due to a reduction in drug efficacy over time , the development of a sedative use disorder , or unwanted side effects. Benzodiazepine discontinuation can pose a significant challenge for prescribing clinicians due to potential withdrawal symptoms and a recurrence of psychiatric complaints. A PubMed literature search was conducted using the medical subject heading of benzodiazepines in combination with the following key words: discontinuation , withdrawal , detoxification , cessation , dependence , addiction , substance use disorders , or long term. Twenty-one studies met the search criteria. Few medications facilitated the successful discontinuation of benzodiazepines or relief from benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Studies were heterogeneous with respect to sample selection , sample size , and outcome measures. Medications targeting insomnia yielded mixed results. Similarly , studies of agents targeting anxiety<symptom> symptoms demonstrated inconsistent findings in the reduction of anxiety<symptom> , improvement in withdrawal symptoms , or enhancement of benzodiazepine completion rates. Anticonvulsants have supporting evidence from small case reports; carbamazepine shows some potential in assisting taper completion and reducing withdrawal severity. These conclusions should be considered in light of a number of inconsistencies across studies in the literature. The results of this review article highlight the need for additional research on optimal strategies for facilitating successful benzodiazepine tapers.
