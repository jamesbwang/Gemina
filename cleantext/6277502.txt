  Revealing the gene regulation networks governing cancer initiation and development is necessary while it remains uncompleted. In recent years , enhancers have been reported to be widely transcribed , resulting in the generation of enhancer RNAs ( eRNAs). Previous studies have reported that eRNAs are a subclass of long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) , which play a critical role in gene regulation and cancer development. These eRNAs can promote enhancer-promoter ( E-P) looping formation by binding to other protein factors or propel expression of downstream protein-coding gene. In this review , we have focused on the characteristics of eRNAs and illustrated the biological function and potential mechanism of eRNAs in regulating gene expression and cancer development.
