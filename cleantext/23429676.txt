  Increased focus has been put on the use of '' ` real-world '' data to support randomized clinical trial ( RCT) evidence for clinical decision-making. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of an annular closure device ( ACD) after stratifying a consecutive series of `` real-world '' patients by the screening criteria of an ongoing RCT. This was a single-center registry analysis of 164 subjects who underwent limited discectomy combined with ACD for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation. Patients were stratified into two groups using the selection criteria of a pivotal RCT on the same device: Trial ( met inclusion; n = 44) or non-Trial ( did not meet inclusion; n = 120). Patient-reported outcomes , including Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI) and visual analog scale ( VAS) for leg and back pain , and adverse events were collected from baseline to last follow-up ( mean: Trial- 15.6 months; non-Trial- 14.6 months). Statistical analyses were performed with significance set at Patient-reported outcomes were not significantly different between groups at last ( Outcomes with the ACD appeared advantageous in both the groups , particularly in comparison with historical reherniation rates reported in the same high-risk , large annular defect population. Stratification of this `` real-world '' series on the basis of RCT screening criteria did not result in significant between-group differences. These findings suggest that the efficacy of the ACD extends beyond the strictly defined patient population being studied in the RCT of this device. Furthermore , reducing the reherniation rate following lumbar discectomy has positive clinical and economic implications.
