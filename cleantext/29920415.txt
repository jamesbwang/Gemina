  The photo-bleaching reaction of the chemical actinometer , Aberchrome 540 â„¢ , is reported for the first time in a series of ionic liquids ( ILs). This fulgide in its C-form undergoes an opening reaction to yield its E-form , when it is irradiated with UV light at wavelengths > 400 nm. The magnitude of bleaching was monitored spectrophotometrically and their kinetics evaluated , obtaining first-order rate constants ( k
