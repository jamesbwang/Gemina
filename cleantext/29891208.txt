  To compare 6 diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI) MRI models for response evaluation in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC). DWI images were acquired at 3T for b = 0-600 s/mm The mono-exponential model had the lowest goodness of fit in both tumor ( R Individual treatment evaluation is possible with all investigated DWI models , with treatment associated changes exceeding the repeatability. The double monoexponential fit with ADC
