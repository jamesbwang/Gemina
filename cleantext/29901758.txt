  The main purpose of this paper is to analyse the activities for Radon Risk Communication under the National Radon Program and to outline the main objectives in the new Radon Action Plan for developing a communication strategy. The preliminary activities were implemented under the National Radon Program. Survey via the Internet for assessment of perceptions and the level of knowledge regarding radon was conducted as a benchmark for evaluation of public awareness. The main channels which were used to inform the population were publications on websites , magazines , in TV interviews and radio ( local) , seminars , from which the most widely used were local seminars. On the basis of this , six objectives are proposed for a new radon action plan: to obtain wide organisational support and to determine the need of risk communication; to develop goals for risk communication with key messages to different target groups; to form and to train the communication team; to evaluate the stakeholders and the communication channels; to develop plans with different organisations for different focus groups; to evaluate the radon risk communication programme.
