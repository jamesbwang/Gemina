  The aim of this study was to identify good practice principles for health technology assessment ( HTA) that are the most relevant and of highest priority for application in Latin America and to identify potential barriers to their implementation in the region. HTA good practice principles proposed at the international level were identified and then explored during a deliberative process in a forum of assessors , funders , and product manufacturers. Forty-two representatives from ten Latin American countries participated. Good practice principles proposed at the international level were considered valid and potentially relevant to Latin America. Five principles were identified as priority and with the greatest potential to be strengthened at this time: transparency in the production of HTA , involvement of relevant stakeholders in the HTA process , mechanisms to appeal decisions , clear priority-setting processes in HTA , and a clear link between HTA and decision making. The main challenge identified was to find a balance<symptom> between the application of these principles and the available resources in a way that would not detract from the production of reports and adaptation to the needs of decision makers. The main recommendation was to progress gradually in strengthening HTA and its link to decision making by developing appropriate processes for each country , without trying to impose , in the short-term , standards taken from examples at the international level without adequate adaptation of these to local contexts.
