  Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality globally. Although cigarette smoking is by far the most important risk factor for lung cancer , the aberrant expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes contributes a great deal to tumorigenesis. Here , we reveal that aberrant expression of endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1 ( EPAS1) gene , which encodes hypoxia inducible factor 2Î± , has a critical role in NSCLC. Our results showed EPAS1 mRNA was down-regulated in 82.5 % of NSCLC tissues , and a new region of EPAS1 promoter was found to be highly methylated in lung cancer cell lines and NSCLC tissues. Moreover , the methylation rates were negatively correlated to EPAS1 mRNA expression in lung tissues. Further , demethylation analysis demonstrated EPAS1 was regulated by DNA methyltransferases ( DNMTs) in NSCLC. In contrast , DNMT1 was verified as an EPAS1 target gene by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and could be transactivated by stabilized EPAS1 proteins in hypoxic lung cells , thereby decreasing EPAS1 mRNA expression by methylation regulation. Collectively , our study suggests there might be a mechanism of negative-feedback regulation for EPAS1 in NSCLC. That is , hypoxic-stabilized EPAS1 proteins transactivated DNMT1 , which further promoted the hypermethylation of EPAS1 promoter and decreased EPAS1 mRNA expression levels in NSCLC.-Xu , X.-H. , Bao , Y. , Wang , X. , Yan , F. , Guo , S. , Ma , Y. , Xu , D. , Jin , L. , Xu , J. , Wang , J. Hypoxic-stabilized EPAS1 proteins transactivate DNMT1 and cause promoter hypermethylation and transcription inhibition of EPAS1 in non-small cell lung cancer.
