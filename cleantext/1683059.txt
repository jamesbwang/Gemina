  The nucleolar organizer region ( NOR) is by definition part of a chromosome , and nucleolus is a structure containing this chromosomal part and in addition the material which accumulate around the NOR , mostly rRNAs and their precursors as well as specific ribosomal proteins. Argyrophilic Nucleolar organizing region ( AgNOR) are silver binding NORs often used to study cell proliferation in various types of tumors. Quantitative assessment of Argyrophilic Nucleolar organizing region count and its comparison among dentigerous cyst<symptom> , keratocystic odontogenic tumor and ameloblastoma. Forty-five histologically confirmed cases , 15 cases each of keratocystic odontogenic tumor , dentigerous cysts<symptom> and ameloblastomas were examined for Argyrophilic Nucleolar organizing region. The sections were obtained and Argyrophilic Nucleolar organizer regions staining was done for comparing the proliferative capacity among these lesions<symptom>. Post hoc analysis for inter-group comparison and one way ANOVA were done in all three groups in this study. AgNOR counts were significantly higher in KCOT and ameloblastoma as compared to dentigerous cyst<symptom> suggesting that these lesions<symptom> have a higher proliferative capacity than dentigerous cyst<symptom>. The finding of a significantly higher AgNOR counts in KCOT as compared to ameloblastoma represent a difference in proliferative activity and greater growth potential between these two
