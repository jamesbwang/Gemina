  Previous research has shown that both the mechanics and elongation mechanisms of tendon and ligament vary with strain rate during tensile loading. In this study , we sought to determine if the ultrastructural damage created during tendon rupture also varies with strain rate. A bovine forelimb model was used , allowing two anatomically proximate but physiologically distinct tendons to be studies: the positional common digital extensor tendon , and the energy storing superficial digital flexor tendon. Samples from the two tendon types were ruptured at rates of either 1 %/ s or 10 %/ s. Relative to unruptured control samples , changes to collagen fibril structure were assessed using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , and changes to collagen molecule packing were studied using differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC). Rupture at 1 %/ s caused discrete plasticity damage that extended along the length of collagen fibrils in both the extensor and flexor tendons. Consistent with this , DSC showed molecular packing disruption relative to control samples. Both SEM and DSC showed that extensor tendon fibrils sustained more severe damage than the more highly crosslinked flexor tendon fibrils. Increasing strain rate during rupture decreased the level of longitudinal disruption experienced by the collagen fibrils of both tendon types. Disruption to D-banding was no longer seen in the extensor tendon fibrils , and discrete plasticity damage was completely eliminated in the flexor tendon fibrils , indicating a transition to localized point failure. Ultrastructural damage resulting from tendon rupture depends on both strain rate and tendon type. Â© 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals , Inc.. J Orthop Res.
