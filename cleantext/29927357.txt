  Bacillus<pathogen> velezensis SQR9 ( former B. amyloliquefaciens SQR9) is a plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium ( PGPR) that promotes plant growth and health. The colonization of PGPR strains along plant roots is prerequisite for them to execute their specific functions. However , one problem of microbial introduction in practice is that the applied PGPR strains do not always successfully colonize the rhizosphere. In Bacillus<pathogen> spp. , two-component signal transduction system ( TCS) DegS/U regulates flagellar motility , biofilm formation and antibiotic production. Phosphorylation of DegU by DegS is positively affected by DegQ protein. In this study , we constructed a xylose-inducible degQ genetically engineered strain SQR9XYQ to improve the biocontrol activity. The results from in vitro , root in situ , greenhouse experiments and RT-qPCR studies demonstrate that ( i) the phosphorylation of DegU in SQR9XYQ can be gradually activated by xylose , which is a component of both cucumber and tomato root exudates , and ( ii) biofilm formation , antibiotic expression , colonization activity and biocontrol efficiency were improved in SQR9XYQ compared to the wild-type strain SQR9. These results suggest that colonization trait is important for biocontrol strains to maintenance of plant health.
