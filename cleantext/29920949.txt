  Evaluation of von Willebrand factor ( VWF) multimeric distribution is useful for subclassification of von Willebrand disease ( VWD). Multimer analysis has historically been a manual , labor-intensive laboratory-developed test. The first commercial method for multimeric analysis was recently developed that utilizes a single instrument for gel electrophoresis , staining , and densitometry. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the performance characteristics of the new commercial method. Studies performed with the commercial method included evaluation of accuracy ( method comparison) , reference intervals ( establishment of normal migration patterns in normal donor specimens) , precision ( multimer pattern reproducibility) , and analytical sensitivity. In the method comparison studies , concordant interpretations were obtained in 19 of 24 comparisons , including normal and abnormal specimens. The 5 specimens with discordant interpretations all involved slight differences and none were considered clinically significant. Thirty-eight normal donor specimens demonstrated normal multimer patterns. Multimer pattern reproducibility was demonstrated in normal and abnormal controls tested on each gel. In the sensitivity studies , adequate visualization of multimers was determined to require VWF protein concentrations of approximately 5 % -10 % of normal. The commercial multimer method is a streamlined test that demonstrates comparable performance characteristics to our current laboratory-developed method and that provides the advantage of both electrophoresis gels and densitometry scans to aid interpretation.
