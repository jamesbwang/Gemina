  This study focused on evaluating the fumigation scheme and identifying problems encountered during the operation in the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration area. Ten district health officers working in different fumigation teams of the dengue outbreak control programme around Bangkok had participated in an in-depth interview. Five predetermined themes , including ( i) dengue surveillance and control strategy , ( ii) quality and availability of equipment , ( iii) delays , ( iv) human resources , and ( v) area coverage , and other emerging themes were addressed during the interviews. Although the staff seemed to know the operation protocol of the dengue surveillance and control programmes well , they encountered some difficulties in accessing households for proper spraying , and a lack of human and material resources , especially during an outbreak. Other emerging themes concerned inefficient communications among the sectors from hospital to district offices , leading to inaccurate or missing patient addresses for spraying , and the lack of community networks and public cooperation for the dengue<disease> control programmes. The findings suggest that coordination among the relevant health sectors to acquire accurate and timely information about dengue cases is essential. Involving community networks should help to improve public engagement with and participation in the surveillance and outbreak control programmes.
