  The reflexive activities of the gastrointestinal ( GI) tract are regulated , in part , by precise interactions between neurons and glia in the enteric nervous system ( ENS). Intra-ganglionic enteric glia are a unique type of peripheral glia that surround enteric neurons and regulate neuronal function , activity , and survival. Enteric glia express numerous neurotransmitter receptors that allow them to sense neuronal activity , but it is not clear if enteric glia monitor acetylcholine ( ACh) , the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the ENS. Here , we tested the hypothesis that enteric glia detect ACh and that glial activation by ACh contributes to the physiological regulation of gut functions. Our results show that myenteric enteric glia express both M3 and M5 receptors , and that muscarine drives intracellular Ca
