  Opportunistic screening for atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) in patients older than 65 years is currently recommended. We aim to examine the effectiveness of a nongovernmental organization-led community-based AF screening program carried out by trained layperson volunteers. AF screening was performed using a smartphone electrocardiogram in 11,574 participants. Among all participants , smartphone electrocardiograms were interpretable in 10,735 citizens ( 92.8 %; 8564 female citizens ( 79.8 %); mean age 78.6 ± 8.1 years). Two hundred forty-four participants ( 2.3 %; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 2-2.6 %; 172 female participants ( 70.5 %); mean age 79.5 ± 7.9 years) had AF and were advised over phone by a nurse to seek medical attention. Newly diagnosed AF was found in 74 participants ( 0.69 %; 95 % CI 0.54-0.84 %) with a mean CHA This nongovernmental organization-led community-based AF screening program is effective in identifying citizens with newly diagnosed AF. However , the effectiveness of the program in subsequently leading them to receive appropriate oral anticoagulation therapy is weakened by the lack of a more structured downstream management pathway.
