  Hospital discharge is stressful for children and families. Poor<symptom> transitional care is linked to unplanned health care reuse. We evaluated the effects of a pediatric transition intervention , specifically a single nurse home visit , on postdischarge outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. We randomly assigned 1500 children hospitalized on hospital medicine , neurology services , or neurosurgery services to receive either a single postdischarge nurse-led home visit or no visit. We excluded children discharged with skilled home nursing services. Primary outcomes included 30-day unplanned , urgent health care reuse ( composite measure of unplanned readmission , emergency department , or urgent care visit). Secondary outcomes , measured at 14 days , included postdischarge parental coping , number of days until parent-reported return to normal routine , and number of `` red flags '' or clinical warning signs a parent or caregiver could recall. The 30-day reuse rate was 17.8 % in the intervention group and 14.0 % in the control group. In the intention-to-treat analysis , children randomly assigned to the intervention group had higher odds of 30-day health care use ( odds ratio: 1.33; 95 % confidence interval: 1.003-1.76). In the per protocol analysis , there were no differences in 30-day health care use ( odds ratio: 1.14; confidence interval: 0.84-1.55). Postdischarge coping scores and number of days until returning to a normal routine were similar between groups. Parents in the intervention group recalled more red flags at 14 days ( mean: 1.9 vs 1.6; Children randomly assigned to the intervention had higher rates of 30-day postdischarge unplanned health care reuse. Parents in the intervention group recalled more clinical warning signs 2 weeks after discharge.
