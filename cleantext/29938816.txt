  When assessing the presence of an exposure causal effect on a given outcome , measurement error of a confounder can inflate the type I error rate of a treatment effect in even the simplest of settings. In this paper , we develop a large class of semiparametric test statistics of an exposure causal effect , which are completely robust to additive unbiased measurement error of a subset of confounders. A unique and appealing feature of our proposed methodology is that it requires no external information such as validation data or replicates of error-prone confounders. We present a doubly robust form of this test that requires the exposure mean model to be linear in the mismeasured confounders , and only one of two models involving error-free confounders to be correctly specified for the resulting test statistic to have correct type I error rate. We demonstrate validity within our class of test statistics through simulation studies. We apply the methods to a multi-US-city time-series data set to test for an effect of temperature on mortality while adjusting for atmospheric particulate matter with diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less , which is known to be measured with error.
