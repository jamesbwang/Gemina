  In this work , chitosan ( CS)/ poly ( vinyl alcohol) ( PVA) nanofibers were prepared by using the electrospinning method. Different CS concentrations ( 0.5 , 1 , 2 , and 3 wt %) , maintaining the PVA concentration at 8 wt % , were tested. Likewise , the studied electrospinning experimental parameters were: syringe/collector distance , solution flow and voltage. Subsequently , the electrospun fibers were collected on a reticulated vitreous carbon ( RVC) support for 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , and 2 h. The morphology and diameter of the CS/PVA nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , finding diameters in the order of 132 and 212 nm; the best results ( uniform fibers) were obtained from the solution with 2 wt % of chitosan and a voltage , distance , and flow rate of 16 kV , 20 cm , and 0.13 mL/h , respectively. Afterwards , a treatment with an ethanolic NaOH solution was performed , observing a change in the fiber morphology and a diameter decrease ( 117 Â± 9 nm).
