  Acid-electrolyzed functional water ( FW) is obtained through the electrolysis of sodium chloride solution. Stimulation of the human fibroblastic cell line HeLa by FW led to the augmented secretion of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF). Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis revealed that both high and low molecular weight isoforms of bFGF were secreted in response to FW treatment. To explore intracellular bFGF localization , a cell fractionation assay was performed. Despite the presence of nuclear localization signals within the N-terminal portion of these proteins , the high molecular weight isoforms ( 34 , 24 , 22.5 , and 21 kDa) were localized in the cytoplasm. FW stimulation drastically reduced the amount of intracytoplasmically localized isoforms , and the 34-kDa isoform was found to localize in a DNase-sensitive fraction , suggesting a weak nuclear attachment. By contrast , the 24-kDa isoform remained in the nucleus even after FW stimulation. Functional differences between the 34- and 18-kDa isoforms were examined further. Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with expression plasmids for each isoform. By treating each transfectant with FW , both isoforms were secreted successfully into the culture supernatants. Stimulation of HeLa cells with these supernatants resulted in the augmented secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF). To further confirm the functionality of these isoforms , an in vitro transcription/translation reaction was performed; both of the isoforms induced VEGF secretion from HeLa cells. Taken together , these results indicate that the high molecular weight 34-kDa isoform and low molecular weight 18-kDa mature bFGF isoform have identical roles in VEGF induction.
