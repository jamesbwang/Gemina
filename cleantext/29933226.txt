  In this study , RNA-seq technology was used to study the protective effect of Compound Longmaining ( CLMN) decoction on acute myocardial infarction ( AMI). The results of RNA-seq showed that the CLMN decoction has a regulatory effect on the 51 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) , which were mainly enriched in the 7 pathways revealed by KEGG analysis. In addition , qPCR technology was used to verify the expression of chemokine ( C-C motif) ligand 6 ( Ccl6) , chemokine ( C-C motif) receptor 5 ( Ccr5) , integrin alpha M ( Itgam) , neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 ( Ncf1) , and matrix metallopeptidase 9 ( Mmp9). Experiment data showed that the qPCR results were consistent with the RNA-seq results. This study demonstrated that CLMN decoction might regulate the expressions of Ccl6 , Ccr5 , Itgam , Ncf1 and Mmp9 , inhibit the chemokine signaling pathway and leukocyte transendothelial migration to play a protective effect on AMI.
