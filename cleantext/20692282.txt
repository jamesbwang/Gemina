  Given a shortage of construction workers , it is important to develop strategies to avoid early retirement caused by cardiovascular diseases in Hong Kong. ( 1) to describe the cardiovascular health of construction workers in Hong Kong , ( 2) to examine the demographic differences in cardiovascular health , and ( 3) to examine the association between health behaviors and cardiovascular health factors. 626 registered construction workers were included in the analysis. Blood chemistry , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , weight , and height were measured. Face-to-face questionnaire interviews for health behaviors were conducted. Approximately two-thirds of the construction workers achieved only three out of the seven & ldquo; ideal & rdquo; cardiovascular health metrics. The younger , more educated , and female subjects had better cardiovascular health scores than the older , less educated , and male counterparts. Fish and seafood consumption was associated with ( 1) ideal weight<symptom> status<symptom> and ( 2) ideal cholesterol level , whereas less soft drink consumption was associated with ideal cholesterol level. The findings highlighted the importance of promoting cardiovascular health in the construction industry. This study provided some insights for future interventions , which should include increasing fish and seafood intake , decreasing soft drink consumption , and enhancing the health literacy amongst older , less educated , and male construction workers.
