  Clinical trials have shown a good efficacy of the `` three-in-one '' formulation of bismuth quadruple therapy ( BQT) for Helicobacter ( H.) pylori<pathogen> eradication. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the three-in-one BQT in clinical practice , and investigate the effect of probiotic supplementation , in Italy. A retrospective database , multicentre observational study was conducted in seven Italian Hospitals. Consecutive H. pylori-positive patients who received the three-in-one BQT for 10 days were included in the analysis. H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication was assessed by histology , A total of 376 patients were included in the intention-to-treat ( ITT) and 352 in the per protocol ( PP) analyses. One hundred and ninety-three subjects received probiotics supplementation. Overall , eradication rates were 90.2 % ( 95 % Confidence Interval ( CI): 86.7-93.0) in ITT and 94.6 % ( 95 % CI: 91.7-96.7) in PP analyses. The compliance was good ( â‰¥ 90 % of treatment taken) in 94.9 % of patients. The proportion of patients with a good compliance was not different with and without probiotics supplementation ( 94.8 % vs 95.1 %). Eradication rates were equally high for first-line ( 91.4 %) , second-line ( 87.5 %) , and third-line treatments ( 91.7 %) in the ITT analysis ( P = .48). Adverse events were reported by 32.4 % of patients , but only 6.1 % of patients discontinued treatment. The three-in-one BQT is highly effective and well tolerated for H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> eradication in daily clinical practice. Probiotics supplementation fails to improve compliance.
