  The EWS/ETS fusion transcription factors drive Ewing sarcoma<disease> ( EWS) by orchestrating an oncogenic transcription program. Therapeutic targeting of EWS/ETS has been unsuccessful; however , identifying mediators of the EWS/ETS function could offer new therapeutic options. Here we describe the dependency of EWS/ETS-driven transcription upon chromatin reader BET bromdomain proteins and investigate the potential of BET inhibitors in treating EWS. EWS/FLI1 and EWS/ERG were found in a transcriptional complex with BRD4 , and knockdown of BRD2/3/4 significantly impaired the oncogenic phenotype of EWS cells. RNA-seq analysis following knockdown or inhibition of BRD4 with JQ1 revealed an attenuated EWS/ETS transcriptional signature. In contrast to previous reports , JQ1 reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis through MYC-independent mechanisms without affecting EWS/ETS protein levels; this was confirmed by depleting BET proteins using PROTAC-BET degrader ( BETd). Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2)- associated factor PHF19 was downregulated by JQ1/BETd or BRD4 knockdown in multiple EWS lines. EWS/FLI1 bound a distal regulatory element of PHF19 , and EWS/FLI1 knockdown resulted in downregulation of PHF19 expression. Deletion of PHF19 via CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in a decreased tumorigenic phenotype , a transcriptional signature that overlapped with JQ1 treatment , and increased sensitivity to JQ1. PHF19 expression was also associated with worse prognosis in Ewing sarcoma<disease> patients. In vivo , JQ1 demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy in multiple mouse xenograft models of EWS. Together these results indicate that EWS/ETS requires BET epigenetic reader proteins for its transcriptional program and can be mitigated by BET inhibitors. This study provides a clear rationale for the clinical utility of BET inhibitors in treating Ewing
