  Semi-dwarfism is an agronomically important trait in breeding for stable high yields and for resistance to damage by wind and rain ( lodging resistance). Many QTLs and genes causing dwarf phenotype have been found in maize. However , because of the yield loss associated with these QTLs and genes , they have been difficult to use in breeding for dwarf stature in maize. Therefore , it is important to find the new dwarfing genes or materials without undesirable characters. The objectives of this study were: ( 1) to figure out the inheritance of semi-dwarfism in mutants; ( 2) mapping dwarfing gene or QTL. Maize inbred lines ' 18599 ' and ` DM173 ' , which is the dwarf mutant derived from the maize inbred line ' 173 ' through
