  Managing top-level athlete 's recovery after an injury is very complicated because it requires a challenging combination of clinical and social/professional aspects with the need to return as soon as possible to sports play. Herein , we report a top-level volleyball player for whom a finger splint combined with a custom made thermoplastic protection was used for the conservative management of a Mallet fracture re-injury. This way our player continued training and competitions in contrast to conventional rehabilitation protocols which suggest to avoid new traumas until the healing phase is completed. After 8 weeks , we obtained the fracture healing and a complete functional recovery without major medical complications. From our results we suggest that novel treatment strategies or modification of conventional rehabilitation protocols are worth consideration for the management of high-level sports players ` injuries. However new clinical studies with a larger sample can compare these results to those resulting from both surgical procedures , and from immobilization and rest as well.
