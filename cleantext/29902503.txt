  The mechanisms that lead to overeating and the consumption of tempting , unhealthy foods have been studied extensively , but the compensatory actions taken afterwards have not. Here we describe the na√Øve models individuals hold around dietary splurges ( single bouts of overeating) and associated weight changes. Across six online experiments , we found that , following a hypothetical dietary splurge , participants did not plan to adequately adjust calorie consumption to account for the additional calories consumed ( Studies 1 and 2) , and this pattern was worse following hypothetical splurges characterized by a large amount of food consumed in a single bout ( Study 3). Participants expected weight changes to happen faster than they do in reality ( Study 4) and they expected that weight gained from a dietary splurge would disappear on its own without explicit compensation attempts through diet or exercise ( Study 5). Similarly , participants expected that when compensation attempts were made through calorie restriction , the rate of weight<symptom> loss<symptom> would be faster following a dietary splurge compared to normal eating ( Study 6). This research contributes novel data demonstrating an important mechanism that likely contributes to weight gain and failed weight<symptom> loss<symptom> attempts.
