  The steroid 20-hydroxyecdysone ( 20E) is a major component of phytoecdysteroid in plants and may play a defensive role against insect pests in higher plants. In spinach , the biosynthesis and accumulation of 20E have been investigated during the vegetative stage; however , these processes have not been clearly studied during the reproductive stage , particularly in male and female individuals. In this study , we analyzed the level and distribution of 20E in individual male and female spinach plants during the reproductive stage via high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC). We found that 20E biosynthesis and accumulation were markedly different between male and female spinach during the late flowering stage. Compared with the male plant , biosynthesis of 20E in the leaves was more active and its accumulation in the floral parts was higher in female plants during the late flowering stage. These results indicate that the female reproductive organs at least in PE-positive plants could be effectively protected against harmful insects via active biosynthesis and accumulation of PE during the late flowering stage to protect floral parts from harmful insects for seed formation and store the available 20E in seeds for the next generation.
