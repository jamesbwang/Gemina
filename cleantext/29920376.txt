  Phantoms , both numerical ( software) and physical ( hardware) , can serve as a gold standard for the validation of MRI methods probing the brain microstructure. This review aims to provide guidelines on how to build , implement , or choose the right phantom for a particular application , along with an overview of the current state-of-the-art of phantoms dedicated to study brain microstructure with MRI. For physical phantoms , we discuss the essential requirements and relevant characteristics of both the ( NMR visible) liquid and ( NMR invisible) phantom materials that induce relevant microstructural features detectable via MRI , based on diffusion , intra-voxel incoherent motion , magnetization transfer or magnetic susceptibility weighted contrast. In particular , for diffusion MRI , many useful phantoms have been proposed , ranging from simple liquids to advanced biomimetic phantoms consisting of hollow or plain microfibers and capillaries. For numerical phantoms , the focus is on Monte Carlo simulations of random walk , for which the basic principles , along with useful criteria to check and potential pitfalls are reviewed , in addition to a literature overview highlighting recent advances. While many phantoms exist already , the current review aims to stimulate further research in the field and to address remaining needs.
