  To meet the high demand for supporting and accelerating progress in the breeding of novel traits , plant scientists and breeders have to measure a large number of plants and their characteristics accurately. Imaging methodologies are being deployed to acquire data for quantitative studies of complex traits. Images are not always good quality , in particular , they are obtained from the field. Image fusion techniques can be helpful for plant breeders with more comfortable access plant characteristics by improving the definition and resolution of color images. In this work , the multi-focus images were loaded and then the similarity of visual saliency , gradient , and color distortion were measured to obtain weight maps. The maps were refined by a modified guided filter before the images were reconstructed. Canola images were obtained by a custom built mobile platform for field phenotyping and were used for testing in public databases. The proposed method was also tested against the five common image fusion methods in terms of quality and speed. Experimental results show good re-constructed images subjectively and objectively performed by the proposed technique. The findings contribute to a new multi-focus image fusion that exhibits a competitive performance and outperforms some other state-of-the-art methods based on the visual saliency maps and gradient domain fast guided filter. The proposed fusing technique can be extended to other fields , such as remote sensing and medical image fusion applications.
