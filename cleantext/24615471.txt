  In this work , we prepared a series of Ni foam supported Ru-Co , Ru-Co-B and Ru-Co-C catalysts in the form of columnar thin films by magnetron sputtering for the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride. We studied the activity and durability upon cycling. We found a strong activation effect for the Ru-Co-C sample which was the highest ever reported. This catalyst reached in the second cycle an activity 5 times higher than the initial ( maximum activity 9310 ml.min
