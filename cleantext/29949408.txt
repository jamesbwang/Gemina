  Endothelial dysfunction is observed in the peripheral vasculature of hypertensive patients , but it is unclear how the cerebral circulation is affected. More specifically , little is known about the impact of human hypertension on vertebral artery ( VA) endothelial function. This study evaluated whether the endothelial function of the VA is impaired in hypertensive men. For 13 male hypertensive subjects ( 46 ± 3 years) and 8 age-matched male controls ( 46 ± 4 years) , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( photoplethysmography) , VA and common carotid ( CC) blood flow ( duplex ultrasound) were determined at rest and during 30-min of intravenous L-arginine ( 30-g , a precursor of nitric oxide) or isotonic saline infusion. Controls and hypertensive subjects demonstrated a similar resting CC ( 601 ± 30 vs. controls 570 ± 43 mL/min; P = 0.529) and VA blood flow ( 119 ± 11 vs. controls 112 ± 9 mL/min; P = 0.878). During administration of L-arginine , CC blood flow increased similarly between groups ( hypertensive 12 ± 3 % , controls 13 ± 2 %; P = 0.920). In contrast , the increase in VA blood flow was non-existent in the hypertensive subjects ( 0.8 ± 3 % vs. controls: 16 ± 4 %; P = 0.015) with no significant change in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. Both CC and VA flow returned to near resting values within 30 min after the infusion and for 4 hypertensive subjects and 3 controls time control experiments using 0.9 % saline did not affect VA or CC blood flow significantly. The results demonstrate endothelial dysfunction in the posterior cerebral circulation of middle-aged hypertensive males.
