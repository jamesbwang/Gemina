  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) is a hepatic disorder that develops in the absence of alcohol intake. Obesity and diabetes are considered risk factors for the development of fatty liver; however , whether fatty liver is the cause or consequence of these conditions is not yet clear. Insulin resistance ( IR) is found to be a common risk factor for the development of diabetes , obesity and fatty liver. The aim and objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of undetected diabetes , dyslipidemia , and IR in subjects with NAFLD. In apparently healthy 100 subjects , with ultrasound diagnosis of fatty liver , fasting and postprandial blood sugar levels , fasting insulin levels , and fasting lipid profile were checked. IR value was estimated using homeostatic model assessment-IR formula. Appropriate statistical methods were adopted to analyze the data. A total of 66 subjects out of the 100 had IR. It was noted that IR significantly correlated with raised fasting blood sugar and fasting plasma insulin values. There was no significant correlation between IR and lipid profile values. The chance of developing NAFLD was high if the subjects are having IR , or vice versa. There was an increased prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes in the subjects with NAFLD. Waist circumference , rather than body mass index , was found to be a strong predictor of central adiposity and IR.
