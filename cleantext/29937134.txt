  The objectives of this study were: ( 1) to estimate STEC frequency in hide and carcass samples taken from beef slaughterhouses supplying the domestic market in Argentina , ( 2) to establish the pheno-genotypic characteristics of STEC and non-toxigenic Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> of serogroups O26<pathogen> , O45 , O103 , O121 , O111 , O145 or O157 isolated from the analyzed samples and , ( 3) to study their clonal relatedness. Sixty hides and 60 carcasses were analyzed. At the screening step , 48 % of hide and 80 % of carcass samples tested positive for the stx gene by endpoint PCR. The STEC isolation rate was 5 % for hides and 8 % for carcasses. The isolation rate of STEC-positive for O26<pathogen> , O45 , O103 , O111 , O145 or O157 serogroups was 0 % for hides and 2 % for carcasses. With the purpose of studying the clonal relatedness of isolates , macrorestriction fragment analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed. The results indicated cross-contamination between hides and between carcasses of animals in the same lot and , that the origin of carcass contamination was their own hide , or the hides of other animals in the same lot. The high detection rate at the screening step , especially in carcasses , and the evidence of cross-contamination show the need to apply additional in-plant intervention strategies aimed at preventing carcass contamination.
