  Ultrasound measurement of dynamic changes in inferior vena cava ( IVC) diameter and collapsibility index ( CI) are used to estimate the fluid responsiveness and intravascular volume status. We conducted an analysis to quantify the sonographic measurement of IVC diameter changes in adult patients at the preoperative and postoperative periods. Ultrasonography was performed on 72 patients scheduled for surgery with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to III. Quantitative assessments of the end-expiration ( D Ultrasonography of IVC measurement was unsuccessful in 12.5 % of patients and 63 patients remained for analyses. The mean age was 43.29 ± 17.22 ( range 18 ⁻ 86) years. The average diameter of the D The diameter of the IVC did not change preoperatively and postoperatively in adult patients with standard fluid regimens. The parameters of the IVC diameter increased postoperatively according to the preoperative period.
