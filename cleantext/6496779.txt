  The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly ( IQCODE) is widely used as a complementary screening tool for dementia. However , there are few studies concerning the efficacy of the IQCODE for assessing the severity of cognitive impairments in patients with Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the IQCODE for assessing the severity of dementia in patients with AD. According to the clinical dementia rating ( CDR) , 394 patients with AD were enrolled and classified into three groups: mild , moderate and severe groups. The IQCODE scores of each group were determined by interviewing the informants with the short version of the 16-item IQCODE. The correlations of the IQCODE score with the Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE) , the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale ( DRS) and the Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale ( ADAS-Cog) were analysed. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine the differences in the IQCODE scores among the three groups. The validity coefficients of the IQCODE with the MMSE , DRS and ADAS-Cog were- 0.528 ,- 0.436 , and 0.477 , respectively. The sensitivity was 66.1 % , and the specificity was 59.8 % when using a cut-off score of 65 to discriminate between mild-moderate dementia. When 75 was used as the threshold between moderate-severe dementia , the sensitivity and the specificity were 73.9 and 67.7 % , respectively. The IQCODE is moderately effective for assessing the severity of cognitive impairment in patients with AD.
