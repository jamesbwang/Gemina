  Several investigators have developed anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions ( ACLR) with remnant tissue preservation ( RTP) and have reported better clinical outcomes. However , the effects of RTP remain controversial. To date , no reports have compared both clinical and radiological outcomes of anatomic double-bundle ACLR using the hamstring tendon and outside-in technique with/without RTP. This article evaluates the effectiveness of RTP in ACLR on knee stability and graft maturation. In total , 75 patients with unilateral ACL injury who had undergone anatomic double-bundle ACLR using autografted hamstring tendon either with RTP ( Group P ,
