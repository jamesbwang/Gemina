  Background The present study was designed to determine the value of pre-ablation stimulated thyroglobulin ( s-Tg) in predicting distant metastasis ( DM) at the time of ablation in children with differentiated thyroid cancer. Methods From August 2009 to December 2016 , consecutive children with differentiated thyroid cancer undergoing remnant ablation were retrospectively analyzed. Serum s-Tg was measured with the high-sensitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay during hypothyroidism at ablation just before the ablative radioactive iodine ( 131I) administration. Post-ablation , whole body planar scintigraphy was obtained 5 days after administration of ablation activity of 131I. Single photon emission computed tomography/low-dose computed tomography ( SPECT/CT) was added for children whose planar findings were inconclusive. Receiver-operating characteristics ( ROC) curve analysis was employed to find a cut-off level of pre-ablation s-Tg as a predictor of DM at the time of ablation. Results Fifty-seven children were included for the analysis. Metastases were noticed on post-ablation scintigraphy in 20 ( 35 %) children: five post-operative residual neck<symptom> lymph node metastases , four post-operative residual neck<symptom> lymph node and lung metastases , three mediastinal lymph node and lung metastases and eight lung metastases. A significant difference in pre-ablation s-Tg levels was found in children with DM compared with those without DM , 603.5 vs. 5.7 ng/mL , respectively. A pre-ablation s-Tg level of 156 ng/mL was established as the optimal cut-off point to predict DM. Conclusions This study demonstrated that pre-ablation s-Tg could potentially act as a predictor of DM at the time of ablation in children with differentiated thyroid cancer. We also propose a specific pre-ablation s-Tg cut-off value of 156 ng/mL as an optimal threshold for practical use.
