  Data on time spent in physical activity , sedentary behavior and sleep during a day is compositional in nature , i.e. they add up to a constant value. Compositional data have fundamentally different properties from unconstrained data in real space , and require other analytical procedures , referred to as compositional data analysis ( CoDA). Most physical activity and sedentary behavior studies , however , still apply analytical procedures adapted to data in real space , which can lead to misleading results. The present study describes a comparison of time spent sedentary and in physical activity between age groups and sexes , and investigates the extent to which results obtained by CoDA differ from those obtained using standard analytical procedures. Time spent sedentary , standing , and in physical activity ( walking/running/stair climbing/cycling) during work and leisure was determined for 1-4 days among 677 blue-collar workers using accelerometry. Differences between sexes and age groups were tested using MANOVA , using both a standard and a CoDA approach based on isometric log-ratio transformed data. When determining differences between sexes for different activities time at work , the effect size using standard analysis ( Î· Results and , hence , inferences concerning age and sex-based differences in time spent sedentary and in physical activity at work differed between CoDA and standard analysis. We encourage researchers to use CoDA in similar studies , to adequately account for the compositional nature of data on physical activity and sedentary behavior.
