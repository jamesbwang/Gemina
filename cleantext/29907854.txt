  Studies linked obesity with a large number of medical conditions including decreased cognitive functioning. The relation between BMI and cognition was proven in adults , but in adolescents the results are conflicting. Further , limited data are available on the impact of weight<symptom> loss<symptom> on cognition. This study analyzed the impact of a 30-week lasting weight<symptom> loss<symptom> program on cognition and determined the impact of changes in body composition and self-perceived fatigue<symptom> on changes in cognition. Sixty-two obese adolescents were evaluated at baseline and after 30 weeks. Stroop test ( ST; selective attention) , Continuous Performance Test ( CPT; sustained attention) and Ray Auditory verbal learning test ( RAVLT; short-term memory) were assessed. Additionally , body composition parameters and fatigue<symptom> ( MFI-20) were evaluated. Improved reaction times were found for ST and CPT after the intervention , but were independent for reductions in BMI , fat mass , fat % , and fatigue<symptom>. Short memory also improved with decreased fatigue<symptom> as an influencing parameter. Accuracy of ST and CPT showed no significant changes. A 30-week lasting inpatient weight<symptom> loss<symptom> program improved selective attention , sustained attention , and short-term memory. Changes in body composition did not explain the improvements in cognitive functioning. Decreased fatigue<symptom> resulted in improved aspects of cognition.
