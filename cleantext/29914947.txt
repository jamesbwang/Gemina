  Gentamicin is a common antibiotic used in neonates and infants. A recently published population pharmacokinetic ( PK) model was developed using data from multiple studies , and the objective of our analyses is to evaluate the feasibility of using a national electronic health record ( EHR) database to further externally evaluate this model. Our results suggest that with proper data capture procedures , EHR data can serve as a potential data source for external evaluation of PK models.
