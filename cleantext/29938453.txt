  Although endoscopic bilateral stent-in-stent placement is challenging , many recent studies have reported promising outcomes regarding technical success and endoscopic reintervention. This study aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility of stent-in-stent placement using large cell-type stents in patients with inoperable malignant hilar biliary obstruction. Forty-three patients with inoperable malignant hilar biliary obstruction from four academic centers were prospectively enrolled from March 2013 to June 2015. Bilateral stent-in-stent placement using two large cell-type stents was successfully performed in 88.4 % of the patients ( 38/43). In four of the five cases with technical failure , the delivery sheath of the second stent became caught in the hook-cross-type vertex of the large cell of the first stent , and subsequent attempts to pass a guidewire and stent assembly through the mesh failed. Functional success was achieved in all cases with technical success. Stent occlusion occurred in 63.2 % of patients ( 24/38) , with a median patient survival of 300 days. The median stent patency was 198 days. The stent patency rate was 82.9 % , 63.1 % , and 32.1 % at 3 , 6 , and 12 months , respectively. Endoscopic re-intervention was performed in 14 patients , whereas 10 underwent percutaneous drainage. Large cell-type stents for endoscopic bilateral stent-in-stent placement showed acceptable functional success and stent patency when technically successful. However , the technical difficulty associated with the entanglement of the second stent delivery sheath in the hook-cross-type vertex of the first stent may preclude large cell-type stents from being considered as a dedicated standard tool for stent-in-stent placement.
