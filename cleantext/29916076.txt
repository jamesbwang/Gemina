  Anthocyanins are intrinsically fluorescent pigments that accumulate in plant vacuoles. We have developed a platform to analyze the fluorescence decay of anthocyanins by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy ( FLIM) , under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Fluorescence lifetime of a fluorophore can be influenced by temperature , pH , oxygen concentration , and other environmental conditions. Within plant cells , the anthocyanin fluorescence lifetime correlates with distinct subcellular compartments. Vacuolar anthocyanins exhibit shorter fluorescence lifetime than the cytoplasmic pool. Consistent with these observations , lower pH of anthocyanins solutions correlated with shorter fluorescence lifetimes. We discuss here the use of FLIM as a tool for analyzing the subcellular distribution of anthocyanins and estimating variation in vacuolar pH in intact cells.
