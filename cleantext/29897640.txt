  A new strategy for the three-component addition of halide anions and acetylenes to donor-acceptor cyclopropanes ( DACs) is presented. This reaction , which occurs with high E selectivity , is promoted by gallium ( III) salts and based on the 1,2-zwitterionic reactivity of DACs. It opens up a new group of processes involving DACs. The reaction occurs readily with a broad range of substrates and is tolerant of various functional groups. This methodology makes it possible to assemble highly functionalized vinyl halides , which are very convenient building blocks in organic synthesis. A possible mechanism of this reaction and its stereochemical aspects are discussed in detail.
