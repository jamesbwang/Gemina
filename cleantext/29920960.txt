  Optical sectioning endoscopy such as confocal endoscopy offers capabilities to obtain three-dimensional ( 3D) information from various biological samples by discriminating between the desired in-focus signals and out-of-focus background. However , in general confocal images are formed through point-by-point scanning and the scanning time is proportional to the 3D space-bandwidth product. Recently , structured illumination endoscopy has been utilized for optically sectioned wide-field imaging , but it still needs axial scanning to acquire images from different depths of focal plane. Here , we report wide-field , multiplane , optical sectioning endoscopic imaging , incorporating 3D active speckle-based illumination and multiplexed volume holographic gratings , to simultaneously obtain images of fluorescently labeled tissue structures from different depths , without the need of scanning. We present the design , and implementation , as well as experimental data , demonstrating this endoscopic system 's ability to obtain optically sectioned multiplane fluorescent images of tissue samples , with cellular level resolution in wide-field fashion , and no need for mechanical or optical axial scanning.
