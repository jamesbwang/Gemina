  This study aimed to determine the incidence , clinical features and management of cicatrising conjunctivitis<disease> in Australia and New Zealand , also enabling comparison with data from the United Kingdom. A prospective surveillance study was conducted over 17 months via the Australian and New Zealand Ophthalmic Surveillance Unit with a one-year follow-up period. Practicing ophthalmologists on the Surveillance Unit 's database were asked to report recently diagnosed cases of cicatrising conjunctivitis<disease> on a monthly basis. Initial and follow-up questionnaires were sent to ophthalmologists who had reported positive cases to obtain demographic and clinical data. The minimum incidence of cicatrising conjunctivitis<disease> was calculated based on cases reported during the study period and from population data. During the 17-month study period ( December 2011-April 2013) , 56 cases of cicatrising conjunctivitis<disease> were reported. Data was obtained for 35 cases ( 62 %) with a mean age of 74 years ( range , 28-94 years). The most common aetiologies were ocular mucus membrane pemphigoid ( n = 18 cases , 51.4 %) , Stevens-Johnson Syndrome<disease> ( n = 3 , 8.6 %) and graft versus host disease ( n = 3 , 8.6 %). The minimum incidence of cicatrising conjunctivitis<disease> in Australia and New Zealand was 1.5 per million , comparable to incidence data from the United Kingdom. This study is the first to prospectively record the incidence of cicatrising conjunctivitis<disease> in Australia and New Zealand and the second worldwide. It provides novel data on demographics and management of cicatrising conjunctivitis<disease> , as reported by treating ophthalmologists.
