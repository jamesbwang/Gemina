  Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the principal histopathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. The essential constituents of these lesions<symptom> are structurally abnormal variants of normally generated proteins: Aβ protein in plaques and tau protein in tangles. At the molecular level , both proteins in a pathogenic state share key properties with classic prions , i.e. , they consist of alternatively folded , β-sheet-rich forms of the proteins that autopropagate by the seeded corruption and self-assembly of like proteins. Other similarities with prions include the ability to manifest as polymorphic and polyfunctional strains , resistance to chemical and enzymatic destruction , and the ability to spread within the brain and from the periphery to the brain. In Alzheimer disease , current evidence indicates that the pathogenic cascade follows from the endogenous , sequential corruption of Aβ and then tau. Therapeutic options include reducing the production or multimerization of the proteins , uncoupling the Aβ-tauopathy connection , or promoting the inactivation or removal of anomalous assemblies from the brain. Although aberrant Aβ appears to be the prime mover of Alzheimer disease pathogenesis , once set in motion by Aβ , the prion-like propagation of tauopathy may proceed independently of Aβ; if so , Aβ might be solely targeted as an early preventive measure , but optimal treatment of Alzheimer disease at later stages of the cascade could require intervention in both pathways.
