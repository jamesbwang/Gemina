  The management of Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC) requires multidisciplinary care for optimal patient outcomes. Radiotherapy ( RT) is most commonly used as adjuvant therapy to improve locoregional control in patients with MCC who undergo surgery. Additionally , it can sometimes be used as definitive monotherapy for patients who decline or are not candidates for surgery and as palliative treatment in those with metastatic MCC. This article discusses the indications , treatment considerations , and recommended dose prescriptions for RT in the management of early- and advanced-stage disease. Considerable hope exists that immunotherapy advances will synergize with RT to further enhance clinical outcomes.
