  Local , abdominal fat depots may be related to alterations in cardiac function and morphology due to a metabolic linkage. Thus , we aimed to determine their association with subtle cardiac changes and the potential interaction with hyperglycemic metabolic states. Subjects from the general population and without history of cardiovascular disease were drawn from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg FF4 cohort and underwent 3 T cardiac and body MRI. Measures of abdominal adiposity such as hepatic proton-density fat fraction ( PDFF Among a total of 374 subjects ( 56.2 ± 9.1 years , 58 % males) , 49 subjects had diabetes , 99 subjects had prediabetes and 226 represented normal controls. Only subtle cardiac alterations were observed ( e.g. LVCI: 1.13 ± 0.30). While SAT was not associated , increasing VAT and increasing PDFF In a healthy population , VAT but also PDFF
