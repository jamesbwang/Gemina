  Each year , ~ 50,000 patients worldwide die of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( LSCC) because of its highly metastatic properties. However , its pathogenic mechanisms are still unclear , and in particular , the prediction of metastasis remains elusive. This study aimed to define the role of microRNA-145 ( miR-145) in LSCC progression. We also aimed to elucidate the clinical significance of the miR-145/ MYO5A pathway , especially the predictive function of MYO5A in neck<symptom> lymph node metastasis. MYO5A and miR-145 expression was analyzed in 132 patients with LSCC , and associations between their expression and clinicopathological features were evaluated. We validated the regulatory relationship between miR-145b and MYO5A by dual luciferase reporter assay. The role of the miR-145/ MYO5A pathway in proliferation , metastasis , and apoptosis was examined in vitro. The predictive functions of MYO5A in neck<symptom> lymph node metastasis and prognosis were defined according to patient follow-up. Our results showed downregulation of miR-145 in LSCC , which was negatively correlated with MYO5A suppression of LSCC progression and metastasis. MiR-145 directly regulated MYO5A expression in vitro and suppressed LSCC proliferation and invasion while promoting apoptosis by inhibiting MYO5A. Notably , overexpression of serum MYO5A in LSCC predicted cervical nodal occult metastasis and poor prognosis , providing an effective indicator for predicting neck<symptom> lymph node metastasis and assessing LSCC prognosis.
