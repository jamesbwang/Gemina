  Cochrane , DJ and Monaghan , D. Using sprint velocity decrement to enhance acute sprint performance. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-Acute sled towing has the capability to elicit a potentiation. Currently , sled loading is determined from body mass ( BM) percent. However , it may be more relevant to use a percentage of maximal sprint reduction to determine an individual 's load. The purpose of this study was to determine if individualizing sled loads at 35 and 55 % reduction in velocity would improve 20-m sprint performance. In addition , electromyography ( EMG) was assessed to determine if any sprint-related improvements in velocity were due to changes in neural excitation. Twelve senior club male rugby union players performed familiarization and 2 sled towing sessions using a randomized , cross-over , and counterbalanced design. Testing sessions involved: baseline unresisted 20-m sprints , resisted sprint ( 35 and 55 % reduction in velocity) , and unresisted 20-m sprints at 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , and 16 minutes. The sled load to reduce maximal velocity by 35 % significantly improved 20-m velocity ( p < 0.05 , effect size ( ES) = 0.21) compared with the heavier sled load ( 55 % reduction in maximum velocity). A significant decline in sprint velocity occurred at 12 minutes ( p < 0.01 , ES = -0.61) and 16 minutes ( p < 0.01 , ES = -0.45) compared with baseline velocity. Other time intervals reported trivial small nonsignificant changes in sprint velocity ( p > 0.05). There was no significant change in EMG. Reducing sprint velocity provides an alternate method to determining sprint loading. Nonetheless , a greater range of reduced sprint velocity is required to assess if it is more effective than using BM percent procedure.
