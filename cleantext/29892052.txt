  Alcohol exposure during pregnancy affects the development of the fetus in various ways and may lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders ( FASD). FASD is one of the leading preventable forms of neurodevelopmental disorders. In the light of prevention and early intervention , knowledge on how ethanol exposure induces fetal damage is urgently needed. Besides direct ethanol and acetaldehyde toxicity , alcohol increases oxidative stress , and subsequent general effects ( e.g. , epigenetic imprinting , gene expression , and metabolite levels). The current review provides an overview of the existing knowledge about specific downstream pathways for FASD that affects e.g. , the SHH pathway , cholesterol homeostasis , neurotransmitter signaling , and effects on the cytoskeleton. Available human data vary greatly , while animal studies with controlled ethanol exposition are only to a certain limit transferable to humans. The main deficits in knowledge about FASD are the lack of pathophysiological understanding and dose-response relationships , together with the lack of reliable biomarkers for either FASD detection or estimation of susceptibility. In addition to single outcome experiments , omics data should be generated to overcome this problem. Therefore , for future studies we recommend holistic data driven analysis , which allows integrative analyses over multiple levels of genetic variation , transcriptomics and metabolomics data to investigate the whole image of FASD development and to provide insight in potential drug targets for intervention.
