  Humans have an innate set of emotions recognised universally. However , emotion recognition also depends on socio-cultural rules. Although adults recognise vocal emotions universally , they identify emotions more accurately in their native language. We examined developmental trajectories of universal vocal emotion recognition in children. Eighty native English speakers completed a vocal emotion recognition task in their native language ( English) and foreign languages ( Spanish , Chinese , and Arabic) expressing anger , happiness , sadness , fear , and neutrality. Emotion recognition was compared across 8-to-10 , 11-to-13-year-olds , and adults. Measures of behavioural and emotional problems were also taken. Results showed that although emotion recognition was above chance for all languages , native English speaking children were more accurate in recognising vocal emotions in their native language. There was a larger improvement in recognising vocal emotion from the native language during adolescence. Vocal anger recognition did not improve with age for the non-native languages. This is the first study to demonstrate universality of vocal emotion recognition in children whilst supporting an `` in-group advantage '' for more accurate recognition in the native language. Findings highlight the role of experience in emotion recognition , have implications for child development in modern multicultural societies and address important theoretical questions about the nature of emotions.
