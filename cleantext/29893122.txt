  The lanthanides ( Ln) are an essential part of many advanced technologies. Our societal transformation toward renewable energy drives their ever-growing demand. The similar chemical properties of the Ln pose fundamental difficulties in separating them from each other , yet high purity elements are crucial for specific applications. Here , we propose an intralanthanide separation method utilizing a group of titanium ( IV) butyl phosphate coordination polymers as solid-phase extractants. These materials are characterized , and they contain layered structures directed by the hydrophobic interaction of the alkyl chains. The selective Ln uptake results from the transmetalation reaction ( framework metal cation exchange) , where the titanium ( IV) serves as sacrificial coordination centers. The `` tetrad effect '' is observed from a dilute Ln
