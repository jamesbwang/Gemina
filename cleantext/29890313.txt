  Methods based on microarrays ( MA) , mass spectrometry ( MS) , and machine learning ( ML) algorithms have evolved rapidly in recent years , allowing for early detection of several types of cancer. A pitfall of these approaches , however , is the overfitting of data due to large number of attributes and small number of instances-- a phenomenon known as the ` curse of dimensionality '. A potentially fruitful idea to avoid this drawback is to develop algorithms that combine fast computation with a filtering module for the attributes. The goal of this paper is to propose a statistical strategy to initiate the hidden nodes of a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network ( SLFN) by using both the knowledge embedded in data and a filtering mechanism for attribute relevance. In order to attest its feasibility , the proposed model has been tested on five publicly available high-dimensional datasets: breast , lung , colon , and ovarian cancer regarding gene expression and proteomic spectra provided by cDNA arrays , DNA microarray , and MS. The novel algorithm , called adaptive SLFN ( aSLFN) , has been compared with four major classification algorithms: traditional ELM , radial basis function network ( RBF) , single-hidden layer feedforward neural network trained by backpropagation algorithm ( BP-SLFN) , and support vector-machine ( SVM). Experimental results showed that the classification performance of aSLFN is competitive with the comparison models.
