  A virulent infectious bronchitis<symptom> virus ( IBV) , designated as CK/CH/GD/ QY16 ( referred as QY16) , was isolated from a diseased chicken farm in Guangdong province , China , in 2016. The complete genome of the strain was sequenced and analyzed. The results show that the genome of QY16 consists of 27,670 nucleotides , excluding poly ( A) tail , and that its genome organization is 5 ' UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3 ' UTR-poly ( A) tail. Sequence comparison among QY16 and other IBV strains was conducted and its results demonstrate that the S1 gene of QY16 has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with that of 4/91 , and the other part of its genome is highly similar to that of YX10. The results of the phylogenic analysis show that the entire genome of QY16 and most of the QY16 genes are located in the same cluster as those of YX10 , except for the S1 gene which is located in the same cluster with that of 4/91. It has been further confirmed by the RDP and SimPlot analysis that QY16 is a recombinant strain deriving from YX10 ( as the major parental sequence) and 4/91 ( as the minor parental sequence) , and that the recombination occurs in a region which includes the 3 '- terminal 1b sequence ( 85 nt) and the 5 '- terminal S1 protein gene sequence ( 1,466 nt). The results of the vaccination-challenge test suggest that QY16 is a nephropathogenic strain of IBV and that the vaccine strains-H120 and 4/91-cannot provide effective protection against it. These results indicate that the continuing evolution of IBV strains by genetic drift and genetic recombination may lead to IBV outbreaks even among the vaccinated chickens in China.
