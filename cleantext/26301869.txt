  Human leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor-1 ( LAIR-1) , an immunoinhibitory receptor , is expressed on most types of hematopoietic cells and some tumor cells. LAIR-1 plays an inhibitory role in immune cell maturation , differentiation , and activation. LAIR-1 is also involved in some autoimmune diseases and tumors. However , the mechanism controlling the regulation of the LAIR-1 gene is still unknown. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in LAIR-1 regulation , in the present study , we cloned and characterized the promoter region of LAIR-1 gene using a series of truncated promoter plasmids in luciferase reporter assays. Our results show that the basic core promoter of LAIR-1 is located within the region -256/ -8 relative to the translational start site. Our further studies indicate that five ETS transcription factors: ELF-1 , ETV-4 , ETV-3L , ETS-1 and ETS-2 , can up-regulate the LAIR-1 basic promoter activity. Of these , ETS-2 is the most effective transcription factor. Moreover , ETS-2 was confirmed to interact directly with the basic promoter of LAIR-1. This study presents the first description of regions/factors capable of up-regulation the promoter activity of LAIR-1. This new knowledge contributes to understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in LAIR-1 associated immune regulation and diseases.
