  A multi-center imaging trial by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network ( ACRIN) `` A Multicenter , phase II assessment of tumor hypoxia in glioblastoma using 18F Fluoromisonidazole ( FMISO) with PET and MRI ( ACRIN 6684) '' , was conducted to assess hypoxia in patients with glioblastoma ( GBM). The aims of this study were to support the role of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( 1H MRSI) as a prognostic marker for brain tumor patients in multi-center clinical trials. Seventeen participants from four sites had analyzable 3D MRSI datasets acquired on Philips , GE or Siemens scanners at either 1.5 T or 3T. MRSI data were analyzed using LCModel to quantify metabolites N-acetylaspartate ( NAA) , creatine ( Cr) , choline ( Cho) , and lactate ( Lac). Receiver operating characteristic curves for NAA/Cho , Cho/Cr , lactate/Cr , and lactate/NAA were constructed for overall survival at 1-year ( OS-1) and 6-month progression free survival ( PFS-6). The OS-1 for the 17 evaluable patients was 59 % ( 10/17). Receiver operating characteristic analyses found the NAA/Cho in tumor ( AUC = 0.83 , 95 % CI: 0.61 to 1.00) and in peritumoral regions ( AUC = 0.95 , 95 % CI 0.85 to 1.00) were predictive for survival at 1 year. PFS-6 was 65 % ( 11/17). Neither NAA/Cho nor Cho/Cr was effective in predicting 6-month progression free survival. Lac/Cr in tumor was a significant negative predictor of PFS-6 , indicating that higher lactate/Cr levels are associated with poorer outcome. ( AUC = 0.79 , 95 % CI: 0.54 to 1.00). In conclusion , despite the small sample size in the setting of a multi-center trial comprising different vendors , field strengths , and varying levels of expertise at data acquisition , MRS markers NAA/Cho , Lac/Cr and Lac/NAA predicted overall survival at 1 year and 6-month progression free survival. This study validates that MRSI may be useful in evaluating the prognosis in glioblastoma and should be considered for incorporating into multi-center clinical trials.
