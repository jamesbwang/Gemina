  Although used as an anesthetic drug for decades , ketamine appears to have garnered renewed interest due to its potential therapeutic uses in pain therapy , neurology , and psychiatry. Ketamine undergoes extensive oxidative metabolism by cytochrome P450 ( CYP) enzymes. Considerable efforts have been expended to elucidate the ketamine-induced regulation of CYP gene expression. The safety profile of chronic ketamine administration is still unclear. Understanding how ketamine regulates CYP gene expression is clinically meaningful. Areas covered: In this article , the authors provide a brief review of clinical applications of ketamine and its metabolism by CYP enzymes. We discuss the effects of ketamine on the regulation of CYP gene expression , exploring aspects of cytoskeletal remodeling , mitochondrial functions , and calcium homeostasis. Expert opinion: Ketamine may inhibit CYP gene expression through inhibiting calcium signaling , decreasing ATP levels , producing excessive reactive oxygen species , and subsequently perturbing cytoskeletal dynamics. Further research is still needed to avoid possible ketamine-drug interactions during long-term use in the clinic.
