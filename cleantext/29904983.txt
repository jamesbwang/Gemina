  Helicene ligands possess a unique helicoidal π-conjugated framework providing high optical rotation values. This has stimulated a growing interest in helicene derivatives as building blocks , which has triggered the development of simple strategies to tune their properties. In this context , we evaluated the formation of cation-π complexes derived from ( 6)- and ( 7) helicene , involving Sn
