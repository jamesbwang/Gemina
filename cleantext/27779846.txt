  Strong coupling between light and matter leads to the spontaneous formation of hybrid light-matter states , having different energies than the uncoupled states. This opens up for new ways of modifying the energy landscape of molecules without changing their atoms or structure. Heavy metal-free organic light emitting diodes ( OLED) use reversed intersystem crossing ( RISC) to harvest light from excited triplet states. This is a slow process , thus increasing the rate of RISC could potentially enhance OLED performance. Here we demonstrate selective coupling of the excited singlet state of Erythrosine B without perturbing the energy level of a nearby triplet state. The coupling reduces the triplet-singlet energy gap , leading to a four-time enhancement of the triplet decay rate , most likely due to an enhanced rate of RISC. Furthermore , we anticipate that strong coupling can be used to create energy-inverted molecular systems having a singlet ground and lowest excited state.
