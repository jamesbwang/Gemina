  Breast cancer is one of the most lethal cancers in the world. The fight against breast cancer has also become a major task for medical workers. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are often aberrantly expressed in diverse cancers and are involved in progression and metastasis. Many studies have found that miRNAs can act as oncogenes or as tumor suppressor genes. Here , we show that miR-433 is significantly decreased in breast cancer cells. In addition , we demonstrate the effects of miR-433 on breast cancer cell apoptosis , migration and proliferation in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of action of miR-433. Moreover , Rap1a was predicted to be a potential target of miR-433 using bioinformatic approaches , and we found that the expression of Rap1a is inversely correlated with the level of miR-433. Further studies through overexpression and knockdown of Rap1a confirmed that Rap1a , as a direct target gene of miR-433 , contributes to the functions of miR-433. In addition , we found that Rap1a activates the MAPK signaling pathway , which can contribute to cell migration and proliferation and can inhibit apoptosis. Overall , these findings highlight miR-433 as a tumor suppressor gene in the regulation of the progression and metastatic potential of breast cancer and may benefit the future development of therapies targeting miR-433 in breast cancer.
