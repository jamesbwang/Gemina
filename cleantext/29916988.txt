  Donor specific HLA antibodies ( DSA) are associated with increased rates of rejection and of graft failure in cardiac transplantation. The goal of this study was to determine the association of preformed and posttransplant development of newly detected DSA ( ndDSA) with antibody mediated rejection ( AMR) and characterize the clinical relevance of complement activating DSA in heart allograft recipients. The study included 128 adult and 48 pediatric heart transplant patients transplanted between 2010 to 2013. Routine posttransplant HLA antibody testing was performed by IgG-Single Antigen Bead ( SAB) test. The C3d-SAB assay was used to identify complement activating antibodies. Rejection was diagnosed using ISHLT criteria. In this study , 22 patients were transplanted with preexisting DSA , and 43 patients developed ndDSA posttransplant. Pretransplant ( p < 0.05) and posttransplant ( p < 0.001) ndDSA were associated with higher incidence of AMR. Patients with C3d + DSA had significantly higher incidence of AMR compared to patients with no DSA ( p < 0.001) or patients with C3d-DSA ( p = 0.02). Nine out of 25 ( 36 %) patients with AMR developed transplant coronary artery disease ( TCAD) compared to 17/107 ( 15.9 %) patients without AMR ( p < 0.05). Among the 47 patients who received ventricular assistant device ( VAD) , 7/9 VAD + patients with preformed DSA experienced AMR compared to 7/38 VAD + patients without preformed DSA , indicating presensitization to donor HLA significantly increased the risk of AMR ( p < 0.015). Preformed and posttransplant ndDSA were associated with AMR. C3d + DSA correlates with complement deposition on the graft and higher risk of AMR which may permit the application of personalized immunotherapy targeting the complement pathway.
