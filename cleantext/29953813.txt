  A simple method to rapidly customize and to also mass produce oral dosage forms is arguably a current bottleneck in the development of modern personalized medicine. Specifically , delayed-release mechanisms with well-controlled dosage profiles for combinations of traditional Chinese herbal extracts and Western medications are not well established. Herein , we demonstrate a novel multidrug-loaded membrane sandwich with structures infused with ibuprofen ( IBU) and Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide ( GLP) using three-dimensional electrohydrodynamic printing and electrospinning techniques. The resulting flexible membrane consists of microscaled , multilayered cellulose acetate ( CA) membranes<symptom> loaded with IBU in the shape of either concentric squares or circles , as the top and bottom layers of a sandwich structure. In between the CA-IBU layers are randomly electrospun polyvinyl pyrrolidone ( PVP) layers loaded with GLP. The complete fibrous membrane sandwich can be folded and embedded into a 0-size capsule to achieve oral compliance. Simulated in vitro testing of gastric and intestinal fluids demonstrated a triphasic release profile. There was an immediate release of GLP after gastric juices dissolved the capsule shell and the PVP , followed by the short-term release of 60 % of the IBU within an hour afterward , and the remaining IBU was released in a sustained manner following a Fickian diffusion profile. In summary , this multidrug ( both hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic) oral system with precision-designed structures should enable personalized therapeutic dosing.
