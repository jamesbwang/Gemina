  Uterine glands ( UG) are crucial for the establishment of ruminant pregnancy and influenced ( orchestrated manner) by estrogen ( E BGEC was characterized by light microscopy ( LM) , epithelial markers ( ezrin , CK18) ( immunofluorescence ( IF)/ immunohistochemistry ( IHC)) and ultrastructure ( TEM/SEM) ( apical microvilli). In vitro formation of gland acini and transepithelial-electric-resistance ( TEER) measurements ( EVOM) were done. The expression of mRNA-transcripts ( RT-PCR) of steroid receptors ( PR , PGRMC1/2 , ESR1/2) and the IFNτ-system ( IFNAR1/2 , IRF1 , 2 , 9) was checked. BEGC was stimulated with IFNτ ( 10 ng/ml; 1000 ng/ml) ( 15 min) after steroid pre-treatment ( 10 pg/ml E BGEC cells expressed epithelial markers and possessed apical microvilli. High TEER-values could be measured ( 2320-2620 ohm/cm BGEC retains its epithelial phenotype in culture and forms gland acini in vitro thereby confirming its glandular character. Cells were only reactive to ( low) IFNτ concentrations when pre-treated with steroids thereby closely resembling implantation physiology in vivo. BEGC can be used as a bovine implantation model to study embryo-maternal communication during early pregnancy in cattle.
