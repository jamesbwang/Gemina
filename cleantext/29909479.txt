  High-pressure injection injuries of the hand are rare , but potentially devastating injuries. The amount of tissue damage is dependent on the magnitude of the pressure generated by the device and the composition of the injected material. The standard of care is emergent surgical debridement of the injected material and devitalized tissue. Although , preoperative advanced imaging is not routinely pursued , MRI may be helpful in determining the anatomic distribution of the foreign material , and associated soft tissue or osseous injury. We present a case of a 28-year-old male with complications related to a high-pressure grease injection injury to his non-dominant hand. The MRI demonstrated peculiar imaging features of retained grease deposits and played an important role in surgical planning.
