  In a conventional Mannich reaction using piperidine , hydroxypiperidines , morpholine , and N-methylpiperazine with usnic acid , a deacetylation was observed resulting in a substitution at C-2 , a loss of an acetyl group , and a Mannich base with a stabilized enol. The enol has a hydrogen bond to the nitrogen of the secondary amine. The structure was investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance and deuterium isotope effects on
