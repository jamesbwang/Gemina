  The precise control in size/thickness , composition , crystal phases , doping , defects , and surface properties of two-dimensional ( 2D) layered transition metal chalcogenide ( TMC) is important for the investigation of interwoven relationship between structures , functions , and practical applications. Of the multiple synthetic routes , solution-based top-down and bottom-up chemical methods have been uniquely important for their potential to control the size and composition at the molecular level in addition to their scalability , competitive production cost , and solution processability. Here , we introduce an overview of the recent advances in the solution-based preparation routes of 2D layered TMC nanostructures along with important scientific developments.
