  Parental attitudes play a key role in their decisions to vaccinate adolescents against the human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>). Little is known , however , about the formative experiences that shape parents ' attitudes about the HPV<pathogen> vaccine. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 parents of 11-17 year old adolescents in Wisconsin who changed their HPV<pathogen> vaccine attitudes ( per prior surveys) over one year. A modified grounded theory approach was then used to generate primary themes of attitudinal determinants. Participants were predominately mothers. We identified three major themes that shaped parents ' HPV<pathogen> attitudes: ( 1) the perceived likelihood of the HPV<pathogen> vaccine preventing cancer , ( 2) agency in adolescence and gauging their adolescent child 's intent for sexual activity , ( 3) the credibility of HPV<pathogen> vaccine information sources. General messaging around cancer prevention did not always supersede some parents ' concerns about the vaccine 's perceived link to sexual activity. Parents often viewed their adolescent child 's feelings about the HPV<pathogen> vaccine as a gauge of their ( child 's) intent for sexual activity. Interviewees felt a sense of responsibility to educate themselves about the HPV<pathogen> vaccine using multiple sources and particularly looked to their medical provider to filter conflicting information. More family-specific ( vs. disease-prevention) messaging and recommendations may be needed in the clinical environment to sway some parents ' negative attitudes about the HPV<pathogen> vaccine. Future research should explore additional strategies to improve HPV<pathogen> vaccine attitudes , such as situating the vaccine in the context of a monogamous lifestyle that many parents wish to impart to their children.
