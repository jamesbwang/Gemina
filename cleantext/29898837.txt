  The impact of frailty assessment on outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) remains unclear. Our aim was to evaluate the individual effect of each frailty test and the utility of an additive frailty index score on short- and long-term survival following TAVR. Retrospective analysis of consecutive TAVR patients for whom a complete set of frailty tests was obtained: algorithm defined grip strength and 5-m walking tests , body mass index < 20 kg/m Frailty status , observed in 266 ( 53 %) patients , was associated with both 30-day and 1-year mortality ( 6 % vs. 2 % , P = .016; 20 % vs. 9 % , P < .001; within the respective frailty groups). As compared to 0-2 frailty criteria , a higher frailty index score was associated with increased risk of death at 1 year ( OR 2.23; 95 % CI 1.14-4.34; P = .019 and OR 3.30; 95 % CI 1.36-8.00; P = .008 for 3 and 4-5 frailty criteria met , respectively). In Cox regression analysis , frailty status was correlated with 1-year mortality ( HR = 2.2; 95 % CI 1.25-3.96; P = .007) , and a higher frailty index was associated with increased mortality risk ( HR = 2.0; 95 % CI 1.08-3.7; P = .027; and HR = 3.07; 95 % CI 1.4-6.7; P = .005; for any 3 , and 4-5 frailty criteria , respectively). Frailty status and a higher frailty index score were associated with increased 1-year mortality risk following TAVR.
