  The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transdifferentiation ( EMT) is crucial for tissue differentiation in development , and drives essential steps in cancer and fibrosis<disease>. EMT is accompanied by reprogramming of gene expression , and has been associated with the epithelial stem cell state in normal and carcinoma cells. The cytokine TGF-β drives this program in cooperation with other signaling pathways and through TGF-β-activated Smad3 as major effector. TGF-β-induced Smad3 activation is inhibited by Smad7 and to a lesser extent by Smad6 , and Smad6 and Smad7 both inhibit Smad1 and Smad5 activation in response to the TGF-β-related bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs). We previously reported that , in response to BMP , the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 methylates Smad6 at the BMP receptor complex , thereby promoting its dissociation from the receptors and enabling BMP-induced Smad1 and Smad5 activation. We now provide evidence that PRMT1 also facilitates TGF-β signaling by methylating Smad7 , which complements Smad6 methylation. We found that PRMT1 is required for TGF-β-induced Smad3 activation , through a mechanism similar to that of BMP-induced Smad6 methylation , and thus promotes the TGF-β-induced EMT and epithelial stem cell generation. This critical mechanism positions PRMT1 as an essential mediator of TGF-β signaling that controls the EMT and epithelial cell stemness through Smad7 methylation.
