  Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV) , which is associated with B-cell proliferative disorders , also transforms T- or natural killer ( NK)- lineage cells and has been connected with various T- or NK ( T/NK)- cell malignancies , such as extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma-nasal type and aggressive NK-cell leukemia<disease>. Chronic active EBV ( CAEBV) disease , which occurs most often in children and young adults in East Asia , is an EBV-associated T-/ NK-cell lymphoproliferative disease. Patients with CAEBV often progress to overt lymphoma or leukemia<disease> over a long-term clinical course. EBV 's transforming capacity in B cells is well characterized , but the molecular pathogenesis of clonal expansion caused by EBV in T/NK cells has not yet been clarified. In the primary infection , EBV infects B cells and epithelial cells and may also infect some T/NK cells. In some individuals , because of poor presentation by specific human leukocyte antigens or the genetic background , EBV-infected T/NK cells evade host immunity and survive. Occasionally , with the help of viral oncogenes , EBV-associated T/NK lymphoproliferative diseases , such as CAEBV , may develop. The subsequent accumulation of genetic mutations and/or epigenetic modifications in driver genes , such as DDX3X and TP53 , may lead to overt lymphoma and leukemia<disease>. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase and the APOBEC3 family , driven by EBV infection , may induce chromosomal recombination and somatic mutations.
