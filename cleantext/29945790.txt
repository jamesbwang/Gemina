  Glycan structure is changed in response with pathogenesis like cancer. Profiling of glycans from limited number of pathogenetic cells in an early-stage tissue is essential for discovering effective drugs. For analyzing tiny biological samples , we developed sensitive , high-resolution , and salt-tolerant method for analyzing trace level of N-linked glycans by coupling capillary electrophoresis ( CE) , laser-induced fluorescence ( LIF) detection , and a new online sample preconcentration ( OSP) method named `` large-volume dual preconcentration by isotachophoresis and stacking ( LDIS) '' , which is composed of two OSP methods , large-volume sample stacking ( LVSS) and transient isotachophoresis ( tITP). A typical LDIS-CE-LIF protocol was simple: a short-plug of leading electrolyte ( LE) and large-volume sample solution were introduced to a capillary , followed by application of constant voltage. In the analysis of glucose ladder labeled with 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid with 10 mM sodium chloride as LE , up to 2300-fold sensitivity increase was achieved with higher resolution than those in normal CE. By applying pressure assist during preconcentration , both viscous gel electrolyte and salty matrix of up to 10 mM NaCl were acceptable. Finally , N-glycans from approximately 100 cells ( HeLa , MCF7 , and HepG2) were analyzed as the model of localized tumor cells. From 30 to 40 glycans were successfully detected with almost same profile of large-scale sample. N-glycan structure could be predicted by searching glucose-unit value via Glycobase database , indicating that HepG2 expressed more sialylated glycans and MCF-7 expressed less glycans respectively , comparing with HeLa cells. It suggests the potential of LDIS-CE-LIF for discovery of disease-specific N-linked glycans in microscale environment.
