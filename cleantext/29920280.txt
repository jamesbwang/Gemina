  Serrate ( SE) is a key component in RNA metabolism. Little is known about whether and how it can regulate epigenetic silencing. Here , we report histone methyltransferases ATXR5 and ATXR6 ( ATXR5/6) as novel partners of SE. ATXR5/6 deposit histone 3 lysine 27 monomethylation ( H3K27me1) to promote heterochromatin formation , repress transposable elements ( TEs) , and control genome stability in Arabidopsis. SE binds to ATXR5/6-regulated TE loci and promotes H3K27me1 accumulation in these regions. Furthermore , SE directly enhances ATXR5 enzymatic activity in vitro. Unexpectedly , se mutation suppresses the TE reactivation and DNA re-replication phenotypes in the atxr5 atxr6 mutant. The suppression of TE expression results from triggering RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 ( RDR6)- dependent RNA silencing in the se atxr5 atxr6 mutant. We propose that SE facilitates ATXR5/6-mediated deposition of the H3K27me1 mark while inhibiting RDR6-mediated RNA silencing to protect TE transcripts. Hence , SE coordinates epigenetic silencing and RNA processing machineries to fine-tune the TE expression.
