  Immune-related adverse events ( irAEs) are frequently observed with nivolumab monotherapy. This study aimed to evaluate whether the development of irAEs correlates with treatment response in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). We conducted a retrospective study of patients who received nivolumab monotherapy at Sendai Kousei Hospital ( The objective response rate was 57 % in the irAE group versus 12 % in the non-irAE group. Median progression-free survival was 12.0 months in the irAE versus 3.6 months in the non-irAE group. The incidence of both irAEs and pre-existing antithyroid antibody was significantly higher in responders than in nonresponders. Multivariate analysis identified incidence of irAEs and pre-existing antithyroid antibody as an independent predictor of treatment response. Objective response rate and progression-free survival were significantly better in the irAE than in the non-irAE group in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with nivolumab monotherapy. The development of irAEs was associated with clinical efficacy , and the presence of pre-existing antithyroid antibody might be correlated with treatment response to nivolumab monotherapy. Immune-related adverse events ( irAEs) are frequently observed with nivolumab monotherapy. This study evaluted whether the development of irAEs correlates with treatment response in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Results showed that the objective response rate and progression-free survival were significantly better in the patients who developed irAEs than in the patients who did not develop irAEs , and the incidence of irAEs and positivity for antithyroid antibody at pretreatment were independent predictors of treatment response of nivolumab monotherapy. Therefore , the development of irAEs predicts clinical benefit and suggests that cautious management of irAEs can lead to achieving maximum clinical benefit from nivolumab monotherapy.
