  In a previously reported double-blind , randomized controlled trial ( RCT) , we demonstrated that daily supplementation with anserine ( 750 mg) and carnosine ( 250 mg) improves brain blood flow and memory function in elderly people. Here , we conducted a sub-analysis of MRI data and test scores from the same RCT to determine whether anserine/carnosine supplementation specifically benefits elderly people carrying the APOE e4 allele , which is a risk gene for accelerated brain aging and for the onset of Alzheimer 's Disease. We collected data from 68 participants aged 65 years or older who received anserine/carnosine supplementation ( ACS) or placebo for 12 months. Subjects were assessed at the start and end of the trial using several neuropsychological tests , including the Wechsler Memory Scale-Logical Memory ( WMS-LM). We also collected two types of MRI data , arterial spin labeling ( ASL) and diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) at the start and end of the trial. We found that ACS significantly preserved verbal memory ( WMS-LM , F ( 1,65) = 4.2003 ,
