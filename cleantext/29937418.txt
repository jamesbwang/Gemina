  Extracellular vesicles are promising delivery vesicles for therapeutic RNAs. Small interfering RNA ( siRNA) conjugation to cholesterol enables efficient and reproducible loading of extracellular vesicles with the therapeutic cargo. siRNAs are typically chemically modified to fit an application. However , siRNA chemical modification pattern has not been specifically optimized for extracellular vesicle-mediated delivery. Here we used cholesterol-conjugated , hydrophobically modified asymmetric siRNAs ( hsiRNAs) to evaluate the effect of backbone , 5 '- phosphate , and linker chemical modifications on productive hsiRNA loading onto extracellular vesicles. hsiRNAs with a combination of 5 '- ( E)- vinylphosphonate and alternating 2 '- fluoro and 2 '- O-methyl backbone modifications outperformed previously used partially modified siRNAs in extracellular vesicle-mediated Huntingtin silencing in neurons. Between two commercially available linkers ( triethyl glycol ( TEG) and 2-aminobutyl-1-3-propanediol ( C7)) widely used to attach cholesterol to siRNAs , TEG is preferred compared to C7 for productive exosomal loading. Destabilization of the linker completely abolished silencing activity of loaded extracellular vesicles. The loading of cholesterol-conjugated siRNAs was saturated at âˆ¼ 3,000 siRNA copies per extracellular vesicle. Overloading impaired the silencing activity of extracellular vesicles. The data reported here provide an optimization scheme for the successful use of hydrophobic modification as a strategy for productive loading of RNA cargo onto extracellular vesicles.
