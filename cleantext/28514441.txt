  Checkpoint molecules such as programmed death 1 ( PD-1) dampen excessive T cell activation to preserve immune homeostasis. PD-1-specific monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized cancer therapy , as they reverse tumour-induced T cell exhaustion<symptom> and restore CTL activity. Based on this success , deciphering underlying mechanisms of PD-1-mediated immune functions has become an important field of immunological research. Initially described for T cells , there is emerging evidence of unconventional PD-1 expression by myeloid as well as tumor cells , yet , with cell-intrinsic functions in various animal tumor models. Here , we describe positive PD-1 antibody staining of various murine immune and tumour cells that is , unlike for T cells , not the PD-1 receptor and restricted to cells with low forward scatter characteristics. Based on flow cytometry and various approaches , including two established murine anti-PD-1 antibody clones , CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and confocal imaging , we describe a staining pattern assigned to a nuclear antigen cross-reacting with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies. Lack of PD-1 expression was further underlined by the analysis of PD-1 expression from B16-F10-derived 3D cultures and ex vivo tumours. Thus , our data provide multiple lines of evidence that PD-1 expression by non-T cells is unlikely to be the case and , taking recent data of PD-1 tumour cell-intrinsic functions into account , suggest that other antibody-mediated pathways might apply.
