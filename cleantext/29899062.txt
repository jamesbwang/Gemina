  A promising arsenal of targeted and immunotherapy treatments for metastatic melanoma has emerged over the last decade. With these therapies , we now face new mechanisms of tumor-acquired resistance. We report here a patient whose metastatic melanoma underwent dedifferentiation as a resistance mechanism to adoptive T-cell transfer therapy ( ACT) to the MART1 antigen , a phenomenon that had been observed only in mouse studies to date. After an initial period of tumor regression , the patient presented in relapse with tumors lacking melanocytic antigens ( MART1 , gp100) and expressing an inflammation-induced neural crest marker ( NGFR). We demonstrate using human melanoma cell lines that this resistance phenotype can be induced
