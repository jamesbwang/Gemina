  To understand the main environmental factors of hypertension , and to explore the relationship between hypertension and leukocyte long noncoding RNA. A case-control study was conducted in a hospital in Fuzhou City by using stratified random sampling method between Nov. 2014 and Jun. 2015 including 382 essential hypertension patients and 382 control subjects. The related surveys included questionnaire investigation , physical examination and laboratory detection. Real-time PCR method was used to compare the expression of long non-coding RNA ( NR_104181 and NR_027032) in the case group with that of in the control group. Multiple factor Logistic regression was used to analyze the association of environmental factors , long noncoding RNA and the risk of hypertension. Multiple factor Logistic regression analysis revealed that the main risk factors of hypertension included: salty diet ( OR = 1. 732 , 95 % CI 1. 204-2. 493) , anxiety<symptom> ( OR = 1. 746 , 95 % CI 1. 326-2. 298) , BMI â‰¥ 24 ( OR = 1. 475 , 95 % CI 1. 030-2. 111) , abdominal obesity ( OR = 1. 836 , 95 % CI 1. 229-2. 742) , family history of hypertension ( OR = 3. 004 , 95 % CI 2. 118-4. 261). The main protective factor of hypertension included: physical activity ( OR = 0. 776 , 95 % CI0. 620-0. 972). Wilcoxon rank sum test indicated that: The expression level of NR_104181 in hypertension was higher than that in control group , the difference was statistically significant ( P < 0. 05). The expression level of NR_027032 in hypertension was lower than that in control health group , the difference was statistically significant ( P < 0. 05). Multiple factor Logistic regression analysis showed that controlling for salty diet , anxiety<symptom> , abdominal obesity and physical activity , peripheral blood leukocytes NR_104181 high expression ( OR = 2. 658 , 95 % CI 1. 109-6. 370) , NR _ 027032 low expression ( OR = 0. 179 , 95 % CI 0. 057-0. 560) were possibly related to the risk of hypertension. Hypertension is the result of environmental factors and genetic factors , and lncRNA may be associated with the risk of hypertension.
