  So far , liver transplantation ( LT) has become the most effective way to treat end-stage liver-related diseases. As we all know , a stable caregiver is crucial to LT recovery. However , compared with LT patients , few studies were focused on LT caregivers.This study aimed to describe the quality of life ( QoL) , care burden , and their related factors in caregivers of LT patients in Shanghai , China.We collected 225 liver transplanted patients and their corresponding caregivers ' social demographic and medical information; meanwhile , we assessed 225 LT recipients ' caregivers ' life quality; by using Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Liver Transplantation in Chinese version ( CQOLC-LT) , Zarit caregiver burden inventory in Chinese version ( ZBI) was used to access the care burden. Self-Rating Anxiety<symptom> Scale ( SAS) and Center for Epidemiological Survey-Depression Scale ( CES-D) were used to assess caregivers ' anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> status<symptom>. For physical assessment , we used Fatigue<symptom> Scale-14 ( FS-14). Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify clinical factors influencing QOL of LT primary caregivers.The QoL of LT caregiver was not optimistic; the care burden on caregiver was still heavy. In particular , most caregivers experienced mild to moderate mental health disorders.In general , our findings emphasized the importance of assessment of physical and mental health in primary caregivers during overall process.
