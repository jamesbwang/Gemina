  A practical palladium-catalyzed ortho-olefination of O-acetyl cyanohydrins assisted by synergetic directing groups has been developed. Thus , a range of olefinated O-acetyl cyanohydrins were synthesized in moderate to good yields. The reaction occurs efficiently with high regioselectivity and with a satisfactory tolerance of functional groups.
