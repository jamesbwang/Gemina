  To identify magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) features in the prediction of tumor aggressiveness in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC). In this prospective study , 105 patients with 122 PTCs underwent MRI with T1-weighted , T2-weighted , diffusion-weighted imaging and contrast-enhanced sequences prior to thyroidectomy. Based on exclusion criteria , 62 patients with 62 PTCs were finally suitable for further analysis. Tumor aggressiveness was defined according to the surgical histopathology. Tumor size , apparent diffusion coefficients ( ADC) value and MRI features on images were obtained for each patient. Descriptive statistics for tumor aggressiveness , sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy of individual features were determined. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to identify features that were independently predictive for tumor aggressiveness. Analyses of receiver-operating characteristic ( ROC) curve were performed.High aggressive PTC significantly differed from low aggressive PTC in size ( P = .016) , size classification ( P < .001) , ADC value ( P = .01) , angulation on the lateral surface of the lesion<symptom> ( P = .009) , signal intensity heterogeneity on ADC maps ( P = .003) , early enhancement degree ( P < .001) , tumor margin on delayed contrast-enhanced images ( P < .001) , and inner lining of delayed ring enhancement ( P = .028). The interobserver agreement between the 2 readers was satisfactory with Cohen k ranging from 0.83 to 1.00 ( P < .001). Logistic regression model showed lesion<symptom> size classification and tumor margin on delayed contrast-enhanced images as strongest independent predictors of high aggressive PTC ( P = .009 and P = .047) , with an accuracy of 83.9 %. The area under ROC curve for ADC value and lesion<symptom> size were 0.68 and 0.81 , respectively.These findings suggest that MRI before surgery has the potential to discriminate tumor aggressiveness in patients with PTC.
