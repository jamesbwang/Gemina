  The bone<disease> marrow niche plays a critical role in controlling the fate of hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs) by integrating intrinsic and extrinsic signals. However , the molecular events in the HSC niche remain to be investigated. Here , we report that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1) maintains HSC quiescence and repopulation capacity in the niche. ICAM-1-deficient mice ( ICAM-1
