  Alkylidene oxindoles are important functional moieties and building blocks in pharmaceutical and synthetic chemistry. Our interest in biologically active compounds focused our studies on the synthesis of novel oxindoles , bearing on the exocyclic double bond at the C8 , CN , and S groups. Extending the potential applications of Appel & rsquo; s salt , we developed a new synthetic approach by investigating the reactions of C5-substituted 2-oxindoles with 4,5-dichloro-1,2,3-dithiazolium chloride ( Appel & rsquo; s salt) to give original (
