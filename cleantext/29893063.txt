  Drowning is a major public health issue , with risk increasing during times of flood. Driving into floodwater is a major risk factor for flood-related drowning and injury , and despite widespread public health campaigns , many people continue to undertake this risky behaviour and require rescue. We aimed to identify key challenges faced by emergency services personnel when rescuing those who have driven into floodwater , and to identify strategies for supporting rescuers in this important role. Australian flood rescue operators ( N = 8) who had previously rescued a driver who had driven into floodwater participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Four challenges emerged from their experiences: involvement of untrained personnel; varying information provided by emergency telephone operators; behaviour of drivers complicating the rescue; people sightseeing floods or flood rescues or ignoring closed roads providing rescuers with sources of distraction and frustration. We propose five strategies for translating these results into practice , including: training and protocol development for ( i) emergency personnel and ( ii) telephone operators; ( iii) training for rescuers regarding non-compliant rescuees; ( iv) educating the public and ( v) increasing compliance with closed roads. Current findings provide valuable insights into how rescuers can be supported in performing their roles , and implementation of these strategies has the potential to reduce fatalities occurring due to attempting to drive through floodwater. SO WHAT?: The strategies presented have the potential to reduce the frequency and improve the outcomes of floodwater rescues , aiding in the prevention of injury and death.
