  To compare estimates of moderate-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA) duration derived from accelerometers calibrated only to walking and running activities to estimates from calibrations based on a broader range of lifestyle and ambulatory activities. In a study of 932 older ( 50-74 yrs) adults we compared MVPA estimates from accelerometer counts based on three ambulatory calibration methods ( Freedson 1952 counts/min ( cpm); Sasaki 2690 cpm; activPAL 3 + METs) to estimates based on calibrations from lifestyle and ambulatory activities combined ( Matthews 760 cpm; Crouter 3 + METs; Sojourn3x 3 + METs). We also examined data from up to 6 previous-day recalls describing the MVPA in this population. MVPA duration values derived from ambulatory calibration methods were significantly lower than methods designed to capture a broader range of both lifestyle and ambulatory activities ( p < 0.05). MVPA ( hrs/d) estimates in all participants were: Freedson ( median ( inter-quartile range) = 0.35 ( 0.17-0.58)); Sasaki ( 0.91 ( 0.59-1.32)); and activPAL ( 0.97 ( 0.71-1.26)) compared to Matthews ( 1.82 ( 1.37-2.34)); Crouter ( 2.28 ( 1.72-2.82)); and Sojourn3x ( 1.85 ( 1.42-2.34)). Recall-based estimates in all participants were comparable ( 1.61 ( 0.89-2.57)) and indicated participation in a broad range of lifestyle and ambulatory MVPA. Accelerometer calibration studies that employ only ambulatory activities may produce MVPA duration estimates that are substantially lower than methods calibrated to a broader range of activities. These findings highlight the potential to reduce potentially large differences among device-based measures of MVPA due to variation in calibration study design by including a variety of lifestyle and ambulatory activities.
