  Hypertension consists a major risk factor for cardiovascular events. Despite the proven effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment , approximately half of hypertensive patients have inadequate blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control. Non-adherence to medication has been shown to be an important barrier to achieving adequate blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control and nurse interventions can substantially improve therapeutic compliance. We sought to evaluate the role of nurse interventions in alleviating non-adherence to medication in patients with hypertension by performing a systematic review of the literature for all relevant articles. Ten clinical studies were identified. The majority of studies reported beneficial effect of nursing intervention on treatment adherence in hypertensive patients. Telephone contacts and home visits were found to be the most effective educational approaches. Although comorbidities are considered to be an important barrier to adherence , there was not enough evidence to elucidate this aspect. Identifying specific factors that affect behavioral change in the setting of a successful intervention was difficult due to high heterogeneity among studies regarding materials and methods. Nursing interventions were shown to alleviate non-adherence to medication in patients with hypertension. Large well designed clinical trials are needed to evaluate specific factors that are associated with effective interventions.
