  The aetiology of temporomandibular disorders ( TMD) is controversial and post-orthodontic long-term TMD data of Class II populations are scarce. To analyse the long-term ( ≥ 15 years) effects of Herbst-multibracket appliances ( MBA) Class II treatment ( Tx) on signs and symptoms of TMD. All patients ( University of Giessen , Germany) who underwent Herbst-MBA Tx ( end of active Tx ≥ 15 years ago) , could be located and agreed to participate in a recall. Available records from before ( T0) and after ( T1) active Tx were used for comparison with the recall data ( T2). All findings were classified according to research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders ( RDC/TMD) and diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders ( DC/TMD) as well as the Helkimo index. Seventy-two out of 152 patients participated at age 33.7 ± 3.0 years. Complete TMD data-sets ( T0 + T1 + T2) were available for 33 participants. Participants and non-participants did not differ significantly at T0 or T1 in terms of general clinical data , occlusal relationship or TMD prevalence. At all time-points , 79-91 per cent of the patients were free of TMD signs and symptoms ( RDC/TMD and DC/TMD). The TMD prevalence fluctuated: 21 per cent ( T0) , 9 per cent ( T1) , 15 per cent ( T2). Similar findings with a trend towards improvement during T0-T1 and recurrence during T1-T2 were seen for the Helkimo index. There were no statistically significant differences. The participation rate of only 62 per cent , the disparate availability of records ( T0 , T1) , the fact that the patients were not treated at exactly the same time period and that no untreated control group is available. In the long-term ( ≥ 15 years) Herbst-MBA Class II Tx neither seems to increase nor decrease the risk for developing TMD.
