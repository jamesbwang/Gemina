  Impulsivity has been consistently associated with greater likelihood and intensity of cigarette smoking , but most studies have been cross-sectional. Additionally , while some initial studies are suggestive , less is known about links between impulsivity and use of e-cigarettes or hookah tobacco. The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the urgency and sensation seeking aspects of impulsivity would be prospectively associated with patterns of cigarette , e-cigarette , and hookah tobacco use over time. Young adults ( n = 335; 56 % male) aged 18-24 who were non- and never-daily cigarette smokers at baseline completed 9 online assessments of tobacco product use over two years. Longitudinal negative binomial regression models were used to evaluate relationships between impulsivity components and product use. Frequency of use of all three products declined over time. Higher levels of positive urgency ( cigarette) , negative urgency ( hookah) , and lack of premeditation ( e-cigarette , hookah) were associated with smaller reductions in frequency of specific products. Additionally , higher negative urgency predicted greater quantity of cigarettes consumed , and higher sensation seeking was associated with more frequent e-cigarette use. Findings suggest impulsivity components differentially predict tobacco use over time , indicating that motives and/or risk factors for tobacco use may be product-specific.
