  Veterans with ESKD initiate dialysis under the Veterans Health Administration ( VHA) , an integrated health system , or are outsourced to non-VHA providers. It is unknown whether outcomes differ according to their dialysis provider at initiation. We sought to evaluate the association between dialysis provider and mortality and hospitalization among United States veterans initiating dialysis. Among 68,727 United States veterans who initiated dialysis in 2007-2014 , we examined the association of dialysis provider ( VHA versus non-VHA) at initiation with mortality and hospitalization rates in the first 12 months post-initiation. Associations were examined across adjusted models , accounting for demographics and comorbidities. Patients were 72 Â± 11 years , 5 % were women , 24 % were black , and 10 % ( Veteran patients initiating dialysis with a VHA dialysis provider appear to have a lower mortality risk but higher hospitalization rates than veterans initiating dialysis at non-VHA dialysis units.
