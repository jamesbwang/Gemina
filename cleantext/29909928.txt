  A growing body of evidence indicates that biological aging or frailty is a determinant of health-related outcomes , however , frailty is likely poorly understood and under-recognized by the public-at-large. Using Whittemore and Knafl 's methodology , we aimed to conduct an integrative review of research on public knowledge and perceptions of aging and frailty , and to create a conceptual model of our findings. Twenty-three studies are presented. The conceptual model suggests that culture , knowledge of aging , and stereotypes influence adults ' beliefs and perceptions. Adults determine priorities about aging , and then subconsciously or consciously determine which parts of are controllable. If deemed controllable and important , they may participate in health behaviors to mediate aging. If deemed uncontrollable or less important , adults may aim to control their own peace of mind through acceptance. Scant findings suggest that frailty is a more subjective term in which participants often optimistically do not identify themselves as frail.
