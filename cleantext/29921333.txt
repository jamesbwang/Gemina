  The importance of parasites as a selective force in host evolution is a topic of current interest. However , short-term ecological studies of host-parasite systems , on which such studies are usually based , provide only snap-shots of what may be dynamic systems. We report here on four surveys , carried out over a period of 12 years , of helminths of spiny mice ( Acomys dimidiatus) , the numerically dominant rodents inhabiting dry montane wadis in the Sinai Peninsula. With host age ( age-dependent effects on prevalence and abundance were prominent) and sex ( female bias in abundance in helminth diversity and in several taxa including Cestoda) taken into consideration , we focus on the relative importance of temporal and spatial effects on helminth infracommunities. We show that site of capture is the major determinant of prevalence and abundance of species ( and higher taxa) contributing to helminth community structure , the only exceptions being Streptopharaus spp. and Dentostomella kuntzi. We provide evidence that most ( notably the Spiruroidea , Protospirura muricola , Mastophorus muris and Gongylonema aegypti , but with exceptions among the Oxyuroidae , e.g. Syphacia minuta) , show elements of temporal-site stability , with a rank order of measures among sites remaining similar over successive surveys. Hence , there are some elements of predictability in these systems.
