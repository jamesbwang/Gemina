  Treatment failure caused by a radiation-resistant cell phenotype remains an impediment to the success of radiation therapy in cancer. We recently showed that a radiation-resistant isogenic line of human A549 lung cancer cells had significantly elevated expression of hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF-1Î±) , and increased glucose catabolism compared with the parental , radiation-sensitive cell line. The objective of this study was to investigate the longitudinal metabolic changes in radiation-resistant and sensitive A549 lung cancer cells after treatment with a combination of radiation therapy and YC-1 , a potent HIF-1 inhibitor. Using label-free two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy , we determined changes in the optical redox ratio of FAD/ ( NADH and FAD) over a period of 24 hours following treatment with YC-1 , radiation , and both radiation and YC-1. To complement the optical redox ratio , we also evaluated changes in mitochondrial organization , glucose uptake , reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , and reduced glutathione. We observed significant differences in the optical redox ratio of radiation-resistant and sensitive A549 cells in response to radiation or YC-1 treatment alone; however , combined treatment eliminated these differences. Our results demonstrate that the optical redox ratio can elucidate radiosensitization of previously radiation-resistant A549 cancer cells , and provide a method for evaluating treatment response in patient-derived tumor biopsies.
