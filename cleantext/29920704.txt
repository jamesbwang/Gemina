  A rapid , accurate and robust method for the determination of catechin ( C) , epicatechin ( EC) , gallocatechin ( GC) , epigallocatechin ( EGC) , catechin gallate ( Cg) , epicatechin gallate ( ECg) , gallocatechin gallate ( GCg) and epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCg) concentrations in human plasma has been developed. The method utilizes protein precipitation following enzyme hydrolysis , with chromatographic separation and detection using reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS). Traditional issues such as lengthy chromatographic runtimes , sample and extract stability , and lack of suitable internal standards have been addressed. The method has been evaluated using a comprehensive validation procedure , confirming linearity over appropriate concentration ranges , and inter/intra-batch precision and accuracies within suitable thresholds ( precisions within 13.8 % and accuracies within 12.4 %). Recoveries of analytes were found to be consistent between different matrix samples , compensated for using suitable internal markers and within the performance of the instrumentation used. Similarly , chromatographic interferences have been corrected using the internal markers selected. Stability of all analytes in matrix is demonstrated over 32 days and throughout extraction conditions. This method is suitable for high-throughput sample analysis studies.
