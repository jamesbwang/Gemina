  Herein , nano-sized covalent triazine-based framework grafted magnetic particles were synthesized by a facile Friedel-Crafts reaction between cyanuric chloride as node and biphenyl as linker. The formation of the material has been confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , X-ray diffraction , field emission-scanning electron microscopy , thermogravimetric analysis , and N
