  Acute cerebellar ataxia<symptom> is the most common cause of acute<symptom> ataxia<symptom> in children and it usually runs a self-limiting and ultimately benign clinical course. A small proportion of children have evidence of inflammatory swelling in the cerebellum. Many of these children suffer more severe and potentially life-threatening forms of cerebellar ataxia<symptom> and may need more intensive treatments including urgent neurosurgical treatments. This more severe form of acute cerebellar ataxia<symptom> is often termed acute cerebellitis. Many children with acute cerebellitis have long-term neurological sequela and evidence of structural cerebellar changes on follow-up imaging. Several patterns of cerebellar inflammation<symptom> have been described. The authors describe the variabilities in the clinical and radiological patterns of disease in the cases that have been described in the literature.
