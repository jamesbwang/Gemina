  To evaluate the evolution of patients rehabilitated with endosseous implants after oral cancer treatment. An observational retrospective study was carried out between 1991 and 2011 with a sample consisting of patients with oral cancer who had been referred for rehabilitation to the Prosthetics Rehabilitation Unit from the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Unit of the Virgen del Roc√≠o University Hospital. All these patients have overcome oral cancer , and have a five-year follow-up after their oral rehabilitation. Age , sex , smoking habits , oral pathology , type of treatment of oral pathology , edentulism , receptor bone , prosthetic rehabilitation , timeouts , working time and evolution were studied. SPSS Statistics was used for statistical analysis of the variables studied. A chi-square test centered on the survival rate of implants placed in relation to the other recorded variables was performed. 17 patients were treated for cancer and rehabilitated with implant prosthetics , with a total of 106 implants placed. 32 % were partially edentulous patients ( 4 patients) , and 68.2 % were completely edentulous patients ( 13 patients). An implant survival rate of 87.7 % was observed at 5 years. In the upper maxilla , the survival rate was 79.2 % , and in the mandible 93.7 % ( Although a high survival rate was obtained in this study ( with lower survival rates seen in mandible and grafted bone) , prospective long-term studies are needed to assess the relationship between radiotherapy doses and the time required for implant placement , prosthetic protocol used , and type of implants used in patients selected for prosthetic rehabilitation.
