  Localized surface plasmon resonance ( LSPR)- induced hot-carrier transfer is a key mechanism for achieving artificial photosynthesis using the whole solar spectrum , even including the infrared ( IR) region. In contrast to the explosive development of photocatalysts based on the plasmon-induced hot electron transfer , the hole transfer system is still quite immature regardless of its importance , because the mechanism of plasmon-induced hole transfer has remained unclear. Herein , we elucidate LSPR-induced hot hole transfer in CdS/CuS heterostructured nanocrystals ( HNCs) using time-resolved IR ( TR-IR) spectroscopy. TR-IR spectroscopy enables the direct observation of carrier in a LSPR-excited CdS/CuS HNC. The spectroscopic results provide insight into the novel hole transfer mechanism , named plasmon-induced transit carrier transfer ( PITCT) , with high quantum yields ( 19 %) and long-lived charge separations ( 9.2 Î¼s). As an ultrafast charge recombination is a major drawback of all plasmonic energy conversion systems , we anticipate that PITCT will break the limit of conventional plasmon-induced energy conversion.
