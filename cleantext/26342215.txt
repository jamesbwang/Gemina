  There are many chemically reactive compounds , including quinone , in living systems and also food. Even after the ingestion of food polyphenols , quinones derived from catechol moieties could form endogenously in the body. Dopaquinone , dopamine quinone , estrogen-derived quinones , tryptamine-4,5-dione , and ubiquinone are examples of an endogenous quinone. These indicate that quinone is ubiquitously formed or present in living systems and food. Quinones can induce a variety of hazardous effects and also could have beneficial physiological effects. This review focuses on the chemical reactivity of quinone toward a biomolecule and its biological action.
