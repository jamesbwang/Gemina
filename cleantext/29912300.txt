  We investigated , in 445 healthy adults whose Heschl 's gyrus ( HG) gyrification patterns had been previously identified , how an in vivo MRI marker of intracortical myelination of HG and the planum temporale ( PT) varied as a function of HG gyrification pattern and , in cases of duplication , of anatomical characteristics of the second HG ( H2). By measuring the MRI T1/T2 ratio in regions of interest covering the first HG ( H1) , H2 in cases of common stem ( H2CSD) , or complete posterior duplication ( H2CPD) and the PT , we showed that H1 had the highest T1/T2 values , while the PT had the lowest. The major impact of duplication was a decrease in both H1 and PT T1/T2 values in cases of left CPD. Concerning H2 , the right and left T1/T2 values of right H2CSD were closer to those of H1 , and those of left H2CPD were closer to those of PT. After adjusting for verbal skills , rhyming performance was not associated with T1/T2 values in left regions , but it decreased with increasing right PT T1/T2 values. These results reveal the existence of hemispheric differences in H2 myelination and underline the importance of neuroimaging markers of intracortical myelination for investigating brain structure-function relationships.
