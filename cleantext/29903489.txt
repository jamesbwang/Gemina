  Automatic segmentation of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> in dermoscopy images is still a challenging task due to the large shape variations and indistinct boundaries of the lesions<symptom>. Accurate segmentation of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> is a key prerequisite step for any computer-aided diagnostic system to recognize skin melanoma. In this paper , we propose a novel segmentation methodology via full resolution convolutional networks ( FrCN). The proposed FrCN method directly learns the full resolution features of each individual pixel of the input data without the need for pre- or post-processing operations such as artifact removal , low contrast adjustment , or further enhancement of the segmented skin<symptom> lesion<symptom> boundaries. We evaluated the proposed method using two publicly available databases , the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging ( ISBI) 2017 Challenge and PH2 datasets. To evaluate the proposed method , we compared the segmentation performance with the latest deep learning segmentation approaches such as the fully convolutional network ( FCN) , U-Net , and SegNet. Our results showed that the proposed FrCN method segmented the skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> with an average Jaccard index of 77.11 % and an overall segmentation accuracy of 94.03 % for the ISBI 2017 test dataset and 84.79 % and 95.08 % , respectively , for the PH2 dataset. In comparison to FCN , U-Net , and SegNet , the proposed FrCN outperformed them by 4.94 % , 15.47 % , and 7.48 % for the Jaccard index and 1.31 % , 3.89 % , and 2.27 % for the segmentation accuracy , respectively. Furthermore , the proposed FrCN achieved a segmentation accuracy of 95.62 % for some representative clinical benign cases , 90.78 % for the melanoma cases , and 91.29 % for the seborrheic keratosis cases in the ISBI 2017 test dataset , exhibiting better performance than those of FCN , U-Net , and SegNet. We conclude that using the full spatial resolutions of the input image could enable to learn better specific and prominent features , leading to an improvement in the segmentation performance.
