  This study examined the role of the `` safety climate '' , or the organization 's attention to health and safety of workers , and of job demand and resources in relation with job satisfaction. Wellbeing at work is a topic of growing interest , in line with the legislation and the programs on health and safety of workers and management and the evaluation of psychosocial risks. Several studies show that organizational actions concerning health and safety can be an indicator of the attention to employees ' wellbeing , even if studies about the relationship between safety climate and some psychosocial outcomes are scant. The study analysed the relationship between job demand , job resources , safety climate and job satisfaction in three different occupational contexts ( public authority , N = 224; social care organization , N = 115; pharmaceutical company , N = 127); workers were divided into groups based on the risk level appeared in the objective assessment of work-related stress , in order to identify differences. The self-report questionnaire gathered information about: job satisfaction , work efforts , supervisors ' support , colleagues support , safety climate ( α between .72 and .93). Data analysis provided: Cronbach α , analysis of variance , correlations , stepwise multiple regressions. The results showed that job satisfaction ( R2 between .23 and .88) had a negative relationship with efforts and a positive relationship with job resources and safety climate. It emerges the importance of safety climate: to support and promote wellbeing at work , organizations could endorse training and information programs on health and safety for all workers and management , not only for professional groups with high-risk level. Future studies could explore the relation between safety climate and other outcomes , such as emotional exhaustion<symptom> or objective indicators of organizational health ( e.g. absenteeism , accidents , etc.).
