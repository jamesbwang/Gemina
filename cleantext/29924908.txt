  DNA repair inhibitors have broad clinical applications in tumor types with DNA repair defects , including colorectal cancer ( CRC). Structural analogs of the anticancer agent sulforaphane ( SFN) were investigated as modifiers of histone deacetylase ( HDAC) and histone acetyltransferase ( HAT) activity , and for effects on DNA damage/repair pertinent to human CRC. In the polyposis in rat colon ( Pirc) model , single oral administration of SFN and structurally related long-chain isothiocyanates ( ITCs) decreased histone deacetylase 3 ( HDAC3) expression and increased pH2AX levels markedly in adenomatous colon polyps , extending prior observations on HDAC3 inhibition/turnover in cell-based assays. Colon cancer cells at a high initial plating density had diminished cytotoxicity from SFN , whereas novel tetrazole-containing heterocyclic analogs of SFN retained their efficacy. The potent SFN analogs triggered DNA damage , cell cycle arrest , apoptosis , and loss of a key DNA repair regulator , C-terminal binding protein ( CtBP) interacting protein ( CtIP). These SFN analogs also altered HAT/HDAC activities and histone acetylation status , lowered the expression of HDAC3 , P300/CBP-associated factor ( PCAF) and lysine acetyltransferase 2A ( KAT2A/GCN5) , and attenuated homologous recombination ( HR)/ non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ) repair activities in colon cancer cells. Novel tetrazole-containing heterocyclic analogs of SFN provide a new avenue for chemosensitization in colon cancer cells via modulation of HAT/HDAC activities and associated DNA damage/repair signaling pathways.
