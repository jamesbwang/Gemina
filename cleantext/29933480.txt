  Chylothorax is a rare complication after thoracic trauma or surgery , especially oesophagectomy , which , if left untreated , can be potentially life-threatening. This article provides an overview of the existing literature on the prevention and surgical therapy of chylothorax. The risk of chyle leakage after oesophagectomy increases with the difficulty of mediastinal dissection and is reported to be around 3 % for oesophagectomy. With this risk , there is the possibility of a prophylactic intraoperative ligature of the thoracic duct , either as a selective or mass ligation. Meta-analyses confirm the effectiveness of this measure , with a reduction in the risk to less than 1 %. In the case of postoperative chylothorax , a conservative therapeutic trial may be undertaken with drainage of up to 1000 ml per day for up to one week. If there is any indication of persistent leakage , rapid surgical reintervention appears appropriate. This can be either transthoracic or transhiatal as a selective or mass ligation and has a probability of success of over 90 %. The prophylactic primary or therapeutic secondary ligature of the thoracic duct is an effective surgical preventive measure and therapy of postoperative chyle leakage.
