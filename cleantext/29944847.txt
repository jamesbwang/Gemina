  Food intake increases metabolism and body temperature , which may in turn influence ventilatory responses. Our aim was to assess the effect of food intake on ventilatory sensitivity to rising core temperature during exercise. Nine healthy male subjects exercised on a cycle ergometer at 50 % of peak oxygen uptake in sessions with and without prior food intake. Ventilatory sensitivity to rising core temperature was defined by the slopes of regression lines relating ventilatory parameters to core temperature. Mean skin temperature , mean body temperature ( calculated from esophageal temperature and mean skin temperature) , oxygen uptake , carbon dioxide elimination , minute ventilation , alveolar ventilation , and tidal volume ( VT) were all significantly higher at baseline in sessions with food intake than without food intake. During exercise , esophageal temperature , mean skin temperature , mean body temperature , carbon dioxide elimination , and end-tidal CO2 pressure were all significantly higher in sessions with food intake than without it. By contrast , ventilatory parameters did not differ between sessions with and without food intake , with the exception of VT during the first 5 min of exercise. The ventilatory sensitivities to rising core temperature also did not differ , with the exception of an early transient effect on VT.. Food intake increases body temperature before and during exercise. Other than during the first 5 min of exercise , food intake does not affect ventilatory parameters during exercise , despite elevation of both body temperature and metabolism. Thus , with the exception of an early transient effect on VT , ventilatory sensitivity to rising core temperature is not affected by food intake.
