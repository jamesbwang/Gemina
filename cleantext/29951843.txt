  A thermotolerant bacterial strain 1D isolated from refinery oil-contaminated soil was identified as Gordonia<pathogen> sp. based on the analysis of 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequences. The strain was found to utilize crude oil , diesel fuel , and a wide spectrum of alkanes at temperatures up to 50 °C. Strain 1D is the first representative of Gordonia<pathogen> amicalis capable of utilizing alkanes of chain length up to С
