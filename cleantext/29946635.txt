  To observe the effect of overdose fluoride on the expression of TGF-β3 in rat incisor and to explore the possible mechanism of dental fluorosis ． METHODS: Twenty Wistar rats were randomly divided into 2 groups. The animals were maintained in standard environmental conditions with free access to food and water ( control group) or water added with 100mg/L F ( experimental group). The rats were killed at the end of 8th week. The expression of TGF-β3 was detected by immunohistochemical staining. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS12 .0 software package. The expression of TGF-β3 in ameloblasts was significantly inhibited in the experimental of group II （ P < 0.01 ）. The gray value of the control group and the fluorine group were 85.89 ± 7.90 , 116.76 ± 8.04 , respectively. Fluoride might disturb the signal transduction between the epithelia and mesenchyma by inhibiting the expression of TGF-β3 in ameloblasts , which in turn may inhibit the differentiation and function of the tooth-forming cells.
