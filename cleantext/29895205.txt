  Since 2011 , the SOPHIE project has accumulated evidence regarding the influence of social and economic policies on population health levels , as well as on health inequalities according to socioeconomic position , gender , and immigrant status. Through comparative analyses and evaluation case studies across Europe , SOPHIE has shown how these health inequalities vary according to contexts in macroeconomics , social protection , labor market , built environment , housing , gender equity , and immigrant integration and may be reduced by equity-oriented policies in these fields. These studies can help public health and social justice advocates to build a strong case for fairer social and economic policies that will lead to the reduction of health inequalities that most governments have included among their policy goals. In this article , we summarize the main findings and policy implications of the SOPHIE project and the lessons learned on civil society participation in research and results communication.
