  Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo<symptom> ( BPPV) pathophysiology is based on otoconia migration from the utricle and saccule to the semicircular canals , however , the role of the saccule is still under study. Our aim is to study the otolith damage in these patients with vestibular evoked myogenic potentials ( VEMPS) and correlate the results with those of computerised dynamic posturography ( CDP). We present 79 patients diagnosed with BPPV between March and June 2017. VEMPS and CDP studies were performed. We selected 67 patients with posterior semi-circular canal BPPV and we compared them with 60 healthy subjects. BPPV group had abnormal cervical VEMPS in 49.25 % of patients compared to 16.67 % in the control group. Ocular VEMPS were altered in 61.19 % of the patients and 6.67 % of the healthy subjects. Abnormal ocular VEMPS in patients with recurrent BPPV was statistically significant. There was no significant correlation with CDP results. Utricular and saccular dysfunction in BPPV patients proved by VEMPS is higher than in healthy individuals. This result may be related to symptoms of instability experienced by these patients occasionally.
