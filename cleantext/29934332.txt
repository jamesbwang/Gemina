  Muconic acid ( MA) is a chemical building block and precursor to adipic and terephthalic acids used in the production of nylon and PET polymer families. Global demand for these important materials coupled to their dependence on petrochemical resources provides substantial motivation for the microbial synthesis of MA and its derivatives. In this context , the yeast shikimate pathway can be sourced as a precursor for the formation of MA. Here we report a novel strategy to balance MA pathway performance with aromatic amino acid prototrophy by destabilizing Aro1 through C-terminal degron-tagging. Coupling a composite MA production pathway to degron-tagged Aro1 in an
