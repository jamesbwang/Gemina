  The search for and use of alternative biomarkers of the hyperactive bladder has garnered increasing attention in recent years because they may be considered pathogenetically significant and used as surrogate biomarkers. Promising agents that have met these criteria include proteins cytokines , neurotrophins , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF) , nerve growth factor ( NGF) , fibrinopeptides A and B , C-reactive protein , membrane-bound ATPase. Analysis of current scientific literature has demonstrated that specialists in many fields of medicine show interest in endogenous proteins that do not belong to neurotransmitters but affect the contractile ability of myocytes. The presented data indicate the feasibility and prospects of their use , but further studies and evaluation are needed. Based on the present literature review , the authors conclude that endogenous proteins activating myocyte contractility are of great clinical value as promising markers for detecting detrusor overactivity , its severity , and evaluation of the treatment effectiveness. The authors suggest that proteins of this group can play an important role not only in the pathogenesis of bladder function disorders but also in the physiological process of urination as an additional non-neurogenic humeral component.
