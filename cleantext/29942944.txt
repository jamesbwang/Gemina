  The effect of amaranth peptides on the activity and expression of tissue factor ( TF) on THP-1 activated cells was evaluated in vitro. An active anticoagulant peptide fraction ( AF) was found to inhibit TF expression ( IC50 = 0.39 mg mL-1) and activity. Immunocytochemical fluorescence confocal microscopy analysis showed that treated monocytes decreased TF membrane translocation by 49.0 % and increased two-fold in nuclei compared to a positive control , indicating a decrease of active TF to initiate the coagulation cascade. Moreover , a cytokine array suggested that the AF mechanism of action implied the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Expression of MIP-3α , interleukin-1β , interleukin-1α , TARC , pentaxin 3 , and PDGF-AA cytokines was highly suppressed by AF peptides , producing reductions of 78.8 % , 61.8 % , 54.1 % , 42.6 % , 37.9 % and 37.8 % , respectively , compared to a positive control. The results suggest a potential mechanism for the antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effect of AF , by showing that amaranth peptides play a negative feedback regulatory role over the NF-κB pathway. In this research , we link for the first time the immunomodulatory activity of amaranth peptides with the inhibition of TF expression and therefore their antithrombotic potential.
