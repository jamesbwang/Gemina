  Stem cells , which both self-renew and produce differentiated progeny , represent fundamental biological units for the development , growth , maintenance , and regeneration of adult tissues. Characterization of stem cell lineage potential can be accomplished with clonal assays that interrogate stem cell output at the single-cell level. Here we present two methods for clonal analysis of individual proliferative cells ( neoblasts) in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. The first method utilizes `` subtotal '' gamma irradiation to study rare surviving neoblasts and their clonal descendants in their native environment. The second method utilizes a fluorescent-activated cell sorting ( FACS) strategy to obtain neoblast-enriched cell fractions , followed by single-cell transplantation into lethally irradiated hosts. Together , these methods provide a framework for generation and analysis of stem cell-derived clones in planarians.
