  Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) has a preclinical phase that can last for decades prior to clinical dementia onset. Subjective cognitive decline ( SCD) is regarded as the last preclinical AD stage prior to the development of amnestic mild cognitive decline ( aMCI) and AD dementia ( d-AD). The analysis of brain structural networks based on diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) has identified the so-called ` rich club ' , a set of cortical regions highly connected to each other , with other regions referred to as peripheral. It has been reported that rich club architecture is affected by regional atrophy and connectivity , which are reduced in patients with aMCI and d-AD.
