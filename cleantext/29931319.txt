  Post-translational modification by SUMO is an essential process that has a major role in the regulation of plant development and stress responses. Such diverse biological functions are accompanied by functional diversification among the SUMO conjugation machinery components and regulatory mechanisms that has just started to be identified in plants. In this review , we focus on the current knowledge of the SUMO conjugation system in plants in terms of components , substrate specificity , cognate interactions , enzyme activity and subcellular localization. In addition , we analyze existing data on the role of SUMOylation in plant drought tolerance in model plants and crop species , we discuss the genetic approaches used in order to stimulate or inhibit endogenous SUMO conjugation. The role that potential SUMO targets identified in proteomic analyses may have in drought tolerance is also discussed. Overall , the complexity of SUMOylation and the multiple genetic and environmental factors that are integrated to confer drought tolerance highlight the need for significant efforts to understand the interplay between SUMO and drought.
