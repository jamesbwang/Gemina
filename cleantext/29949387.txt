  Nasopharyngeal dermoids associated with cleft palate present as intraoral protruding masses. Only 5 cases of nasopharyngeal dermoids associated with cleft palate have been reported in the literature. We are reporting 4 such cases encountered by us in the last 10 years in our series of 900 cleft palate surgeries. Imaging studies were done to know the extension of dermoid and to look for any associated congenital intracranial anomalies. We observed that nasopharyngeal dermoids are usually nonmalignant and can be easily managed by complete local excision followed by palatal closure after 6 months.
