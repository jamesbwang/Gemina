  Perception is relational: object properties are perceived in comparison to the spatiotemporal context rather than absolutely. This principle predicts well known contrast effects: For instance , the same sphere will feel smaller after feeling a larger sphere and larger after feeling a smaller sphere ( the Uznadze effect). In a series of experiments , we used a visual version of the Uznadze effect to test whether such contrast effects can be modulated by organizational factors , such as the similarity between the contrasting inducer stimulus and the contrasted induced stimulus. We report that this is indeed the case: size contrast is attenuated for inducer-inducing pairs having different 3D shapes , orientations , and even- surprisingly- color and lightness , in comparison to equivalent conditions where these features are the same. These findings complement related work in revealing basic mechanisms for fine-tuning local interactions in space-time in accord to the global stimulus context.
