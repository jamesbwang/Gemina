  We have developed an efficient diastereo- and enantioselective Mannich/cyclization cascade reaction of Î±-substituted isocyanoacetates with 4-aryl-3-carbonyl-1,2,5-thiadiazole-1,1-dioxide type cyclic sulfamide ketimines cooperatively catalyzed by cinchona alkaloid-derived squaramide and AgOAc. The corresponding optically active 2,3,3a,4-tetrahydroimidazo ( 1,5-b) ( 1,2,5) thiadiazole-1,1-dioxide derivatives were obtained in excellent yields ( up to 99 %) and good to excellent stereoselectivities ( up to > 20: 1 dr , up to 94 % ee).
