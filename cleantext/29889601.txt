  To explore the bidirectional relations between alcohol use and three impulsive personality traits , to advance understanding of risk processes. 525 college students ( mean age = 18.95 years) recruited in August 2008 and 2009 and followed up annually for three years. Personality and past/current substance use were assessed. T2 sensation seeking mediated the predictive relationship between T1 and T3 alcohol use , and T2 alcohol use mediated the predictive relationship between T1 and T3 sensation seeking. In addition , T2 alcohol problems mediated the predictive relationship between T1 alcohol use and T3 negative urgency. Findings support a bidirectional relationship between sensation seeking and alcohol use , and drinking anticipates drinking problems , which predict increases in negative urgency. For some individuals , there appears to be an ongoing process of increased risk in the form of increases in both drinking and high-risk personality traits.
