  Recurrent inflammation<symptom> in severe equine asthma causes a remodeling of the airways leading to incompletely reversible airway obstruction. Despite the improvement of clinical signs and lung function with glucocorticoids ( GC) , inflammation<symptom> , translated by an increased percentage of neutrophils , persists in the airways. Regulatory T cells ( Treg) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and play an important role in balancing the immune response by suppressing effector lymphocyte<symptom> activity. However , interactions between Treg , neutrophils and glucocorticosteroids in vivo are unclear , particularly in asthma. Furthermore , the effects of GC on Treg in the airway of asthmatic horses have not been investigated. We hypothesized that horses with severe asthma display a decreased population of pulmonary Treg when compared to heathy controls , and that treatment with GC lead to an increased pulmonary Treg cell population only in affected horses. Using lung function measurements and flow cytometry with surface antigens CD4 and FoxP3 , we investigated Treg in airway luminal cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF) from 6 asthmatic horses in exacerbation of the disease and 6 aged-match controls , kept in the same environment , before and following a 2-week treatment with dexamethasone. Results showed that the number of Treg increases only in the lungs of asthmatic horses following GC therapy , despite continued presence of increased numbers of neutrophils. Our results support the complexity of the interaction between Treg , neutrophils and GC.
