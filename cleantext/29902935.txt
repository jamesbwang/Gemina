  The South Dakota Healthy Vending & Snack Bar Toolkit is a document designed by the South Dakota Department of Health ( SD DOH) Office of Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion as part of a 5-year policy project to increase healthy food and beverage choices in vending machines , snack bars , and cafeterias in South Dakota. The toolkit includes guidelines , steps , and tools for businesses to implement the Healthy Vending and Snack Bar ( HVSB) Policy. Although the toolkit was prepared as part of a policy project that ran from July 1 , 2015 to June 30 , 2016 , the toolkit 's guidelines and templates remain relevant to anyone interested in an improved approach to healthy food and beverage options.
