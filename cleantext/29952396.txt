  The article presents partial results of a study at Hospital Edgar Santos , Universidade Federal da Bahia ( HUPES) , Brazil , analyzing the service 's experience with improvement in quality of care within a context of hospital accreditation. The article focuses on the hematology service and specifically its quality of care and intersubjective processes. The study adopted a qualitative approach , using interviews and observation. From the theoretical point of view , the work of Campos , Cec√≠lio , and Merhy acknowledge healthcare 's complex nature and micropolitical and intersubjective dimension and the capacity of health professionals to produce meanings and practice creativity. To understand the health professionals ' processes of psychosocial linkage and subjective mobilization , we drew on concepts from the French school of psychosociology ( Enriquez) and Dejours ' psychodynamics of work. The analysis was organized along three lines: psychosocial linkage and the imaginary of self-management; bonding and affect: singularity of the subject 's care and clinical case; real work and the healthcare team. One of the main conclusions is the building of a self-management imaginary , expressed in shared projects , expectations , and some forms of interpreting and operating reality , based on affectively invested representations of autonomy and unity. Alongside technical elements such as protocols , the article highlights professional judgment , proper to the intersubjective dimension , fostering the singularity of care. In our view , the real work in the patient care scene is traversed by adjustments that demonstrate team cooperation.
