  Exercise and dehydration<symptom> may be associated with a compromised kidney function and potential signs of kidney injury. However , the kidney responses to exercise of different durations and hypohydration levels are not yet known. Therefore , we aimed to compare the effects of acute versus prolonged exercise and dehydration<symptom> on estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) and kidney injury biomarkers in healthy male adults. A total of 35 subjects ( 23 ± 3 years) were included and invited for two study visits. Visit 1 consisted of a maximal cycling test. On Visit 2 , subjects performed a submaximal exercise test at 80 % of maximal heart rate until 3 % hypohydration. Blood and urine samples were taken at baseline , after 30 min of exercise ( acute effects; low level of hypohydration) and after 150 min of exercise or when 3 % hypohydration was achieved ( prolonged effects , high level of hypohydration). Urinary outcome parameters were corrected for urinary cystatin C , creatinine , and osmolality. Subjects dehydrated on average 0.6 ± 0.3 % and 2.9 ± 0.7 % after acute and prolonged exercise , respectively ( P < 0.001). The eGFR
