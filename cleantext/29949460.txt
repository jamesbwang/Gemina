  A hippocampal prosthesis is a very large scale integration ( VLSI) biochip that needs to be implanted in the biological brain to solve a cognitive dysfunction. In this letter , we propose a novel low-complexity , small-area , and low-power programmable hippocampal neural network application-specific integrated circuit ( ASIC) for a hippocampal prosthesis. It is based on the nonlinear dynamical model of the hippocampus: namely multi-input , multi-output ( MIMO)- generalized Laguerre-Volterra model ( GLVM). It can realize the real-time prediction of hippocampal neural activity. New hardware architecture , a storage space configuration scheme , low-power convolution , and gaussian random number generator modules are proposed. The ASIC is fabricated in 40 nm technology with a core area of 0.122 mm ( Formula: see text) and test power of 84.4 ( Formula: see text) W. Compared with the design based on the traditional architecture , experimental results show that the core area of the chip is reduced by 84.94 % and the core power is reduced by 24.30 %.
