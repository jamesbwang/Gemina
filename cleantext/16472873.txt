  The oral immunomodulatory agent laquinimod is currently evaluated for multiple sclerosis ( MS) treatment. Phase II and III studies demonstrated a reduction of degenerative processes. In addition to anti-inflammatory effects , laquinimod might have neuroprotective properties , but its impact on the visual system , which is often affected by MS , is unknown. The aim of our study was to investigate potential protective effects of laquinimod on the optic nerve and retina in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis<disease> ( EAE) model. We induced EAE in C57/BL6 mice via MOG Laquinimod reduced neurological EAE symptoms and improved the neuronal electrical output of the inner nuclear layer compared to untreated EAE mice. Furthermore , cellular infiltration , especially recruited phagocytes , and demyelination in the optic nerve were reduced. Microglia were diminished in optic nerve and retina. Retinal macroglial signal was reduced under treatment , whereas in the optic nerve macroglia were not affected. Additionally , laquinimod preserved retinal ganglion cells and reduced apoptosis. A later treatment with laquinimod in a therapeutic approach led to a reduction of clinical signs and to an improved b-wave amplitude. However , no changes in cellular infiltration and demyelination of the optic nerves were observed. Also , the number of retinal ganglion cells remained unaltered. From our study , we deduce neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of laquinimod on the optic nerve and retina in EAE mice , when animals were treated before any clinical signs were noted. Given the fact that the visual system is frequently affected by MS , the agent might be an interesting subject of further neuro-ophthalmic investigations.
