  The mechanism of a trinuclear cooperative dehydrogenative C-N bond forming reaction is investigated in this work , which avoids the use of chelate assisting directing groups. Two new highly efficient Ru/Cu co-catalyzed systems were identified , allowing three orders of magnitude greater TOFs than the previous state of the art. In-depth kinetic studies were performed in combination with advanced DFT calculations , which reveal a decisive rate-determining trinuclear Ru-Cu cooperative reductive elimination step ( CRE).
