  Surgical management of benign or malignant cutaneous tumors may result in noticeable scars that are of great concern to patients , regardless of sex , age , or ethnicity. Techniques to optimize surgical scars are discussed in this three-part review. Part 3 focuses on scar revision for erythema , hyperpigmentation , and hypopigmentation. Scar revision options for erythematous scars include moist exposed burn ointment ( MEBO) , onion extract , silicone , methyl aminolevulinate-photodynamic therapy ( MAL-PDT) , pulsed dye laser , intense pulsed light ( IPL) , and nonablative fractional lasers. Hyperpigmented scars may be treated with tyrosinase inhibitors , IPL , and nonablative fractional lasers. Hypopigmented scars may be treated with needle dermabrasion , medical tattoos , autologous cell transplantation , prostaglandin analogues , retinoids , calcineurin inhibitors , excimer laser , and nonablative fractional lasers.
