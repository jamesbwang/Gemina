  An innovative method based on topological data analysis is introduced for classifying EEG recordings of patients affected by epilepsy. We construct a topological space from a collection of EEGs signals using Persistent Homology; then , we analyse the space by Persistent entropy , a global topological feature , in order to classify healthy and epileptic signals. The performance of the resulting one-feature-based linear topological classifier is tested by analysing the Physionet dataset. The quality of classification is evaluated in terms of the Area Under Curve ( AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve. It is shown that the linear topological classifier has an AUC equal to ( Formula: see text) while the performance of a classifier based on Sample Entropy has an AUC equal to 62.0 %.
