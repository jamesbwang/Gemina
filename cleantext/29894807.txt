  Pathogenic microbes are becoming a potential threat to human beings and environment. Owing to the biofilm forming ability , multidrug resistant pathogens have emerged , which has led to increased death and mortality rate. CuO is a transition metal oxide with high captivating property used for various technological applications such as superconductors , gas sensors , photocatalytic applications etc.. CuO in the form of nanoparticles ( NPs) is a potential candidate against microbial pathogens. Recently , the antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties of CuO have been tested against various pathogenic bacteria and fungi<pathogen> In the present study , Fe doped CuO synthesized using sol-gel method was tested against pathogenic bacteria and fungus. The synthesized NPs were characterized using XRD , FTIR , SEM and EDAX analysis. The photocatalytic activity of the Fe doped CuO NPs was analysed using UV-Vis and fluorescent light spectroscopic analysis ( FL). In vitro analysis was performed to analyze the antimicrobial and antibiofilm potentials of Fe doped CuO NPs against the pathogenic bacteria ( Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and Staphylococcus<pathogen> epidermidis<pathogen> and fungus ( Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> Therefore , the present study is the first report showing both antibiofilm and antibacterial activities of Fe doped CuO NPs against bacterial and fungal pathogens.
