  Cerebral vasculature and neuronal networks will be largely destroyed due to the oxidative damage by overproduced reactive oxygen species ( ROS) during a stroke , accompanied by the symptoms of ischemic injury and blood-brain barrier ( BBB) disruption. Ceria nanoparticles , acting as an effective and recyclable ROS scavenger , have been shown to be highly effective in neuroprotection. However , the brain access of nanoparticles can only be achieved by targeting the damaged area of BBB , leading to the disrupted BBB being unprotected and to turbulence of the microenvironment in the brain. Nevertheless , the integrity of the BBB will cause very limited accumulation of therapeutic nanoparticles in brain lesions<symptom>. This dilemma is a great challenge in the development of efficient stroke nanotherapeutics. Herein , we have developed an effective stroke treatment agent based on monodisperse ceria nanoparticles , which are loaded with edaravone and modified with Angiopep-2 and poly ( ethylene glycol) on their surface ( E-A/P-CeO
