  Mucolipidoses are metabolic disorders with autosomal recessive inheritance caused by deficiency of N-acetylglucosamine- 1-phosphotransferase leading to accumulation of glycosaminoglycans and sphingolipids intracellularly. The differential diagnosis of mucolipidosis II or III is based on the age of onset , clinical findings and degree of severity. In this article , we present four pediatric patients with mucolipidosis III or pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy who admitted to our hospital with joint stiffness. They were from consanguineous families with characteristic radiographic findings. The joints were painless and the rheumatologic evaluation and inflammation<symptom> markers were negative. Mucolipidosis is a rare disease in pediatric patients to remember in differential diagnosis of joint stiffness.
