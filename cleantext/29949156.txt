  MiR-381-3p plays an essential role in the progression of a variety of cancers , but its expression and role in papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC) progression have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of miR-381-3p and its function in PTC. The expression levels of miR-381-3p and low-density lipoprotein receptor‑related protein 6 ( LRP6) mRNA in PTC tissues and cell lines were measured using RT-PCR. Cell proliferation , migration and invasion were assessed by cell viability assay and transwell assay. Luciferase assays and Western blotting were performed to demonstrate miR-381-3p target gene. We found that miR-381-3p was significantly down-regulated in PTC tissues and cell lines. In vitro assay indicated that up-regulation of miR-381-3p significantly suppressed PTC cell proliferation , migration and invasion. Moreover , luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that miR-381-3p could target LRP6 by binding to the 3 ' UTR. Western blot and Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT‑qPCR) showed that miR-381-3p overexpression suppressed the expression of LRP6 at both mRNA and proteins levels. In addition , functional experiment confirmed that LRP6 was involved in the suppressive effect of miR-381-3p-mediated PTC on cell proliferation , migration and invasion. Our findings suggested , for the first time , that miR-381-3p was lowly expressed in PTC tissues , and its up-regulation inhibited tumorigenesis of PTC by targeting LRP6.
