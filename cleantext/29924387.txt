  Black men who have sex with men ( MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV<pathogen> infection. Efforts are needed to understand correlates of HIV<pathogen> risk among this group. Alcohol consumption may have a role in HIV<pathogen> transmission given its association with condomless sex. This study aimed to examine the association between alcohol consumption ( i.e. , drinking before/during sex and levels of alcohol use problems) and condom use during lifetime , past 6 months , and the event ( i.e. , a specific sexual episode) level. Black MSM ( N = 102) reported sexual behavior and condom use for lifetime , past 6 months , and the most recent condom and condomless sex events. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT) determined alcohol use problems. Ordinal and binary regression analyses analyzed associations between AUDIT scores and condomless sex ( receptive and insertive). AUDIT scores were associated with a greater likelihood of condomless sex ( lifetime receptive sex: OR = 1.06 , p < 0.05; past 6 months insertive sex: odds ratio ( OR) = 1.09 , p < 0.01). At the event level , there was no greater likelihood of drinking during last condomless sex as compared to last condom sex , Ï‡ There was evidence that an increase in alcohol use problems was associated with a greater likelihood of risky sexual behavior. Drinking before/during sex was not related to condom use. These findings contribute to understanding the nuanced relationship between alcohol use and sexual risk.
