  Biological systems exchange information often with chemical signals. Here , we demonstrate the chemical delivery of a fluorescent label using a bioelectronic trigger. Acid-sensitive microparticles release fluorescin diacetate upon low pH induced by a bioelectronic device. Cardiac fibroblast cells ( CFs) uptake fluorescin diacetate , which transforms into fluorescein and emits a fluorescent signal. This proof-of-concept bioelectronic triggered delivery may be used in the future for real-time programming and control of cells and cell systems.
