  Tinnitus<symptom> described as individual perception of phantom sound constitutes a significant medical problem and has become an essential subject of many studies conducted worldwide. In the study , we aimed to examine the prevalence of tinnitus<symptom> among Polish hearing loss ( HL) patients with identified mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) variants. Among the selected group of unrelated HL patients with known mtDNA pathogenic variants , two questionnaires were conducted , i.e. Tinnitus<symptom> Handicap Inventory translated into Polish ( THI-POL) and Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS) for measuring subjectively perceived tinnitus<symptom> loudness , distress , annoyance and possibility of coping with this condition ( VASs). Pathogenic mtDNA variants were detected with real-time PCR and sequencing of the whole mtDNA. This is the first extensive tinnitus<symptom> characterization using THI-POL and VASs questionnaires in HL patients due to mtDNA variants. We have established the prevalence of tinnitus<symptom> among the studied group at 23.5 %. We found that there are no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of tinnitus<symptom> and its characteristic features between HL patients with known HL mtDNA variants and the general Polish population. In Polish HL patients with tinnitus<symptom> , m. 7511T > C was significantly more frequent than in patients without tinnitus<symptom>. We observed that the prevalence of tinnitus<symptom> is lower in Polish patients with m. 1555A > G as compared to other available data. Our data suggest that the mtDNA variants causative of HL may affect tinnitus<symptom> development but this effect seems to be ethnic-specific.
