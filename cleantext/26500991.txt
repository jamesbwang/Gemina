  Although the last 50 years of clinical and preclinical research have demonstrated that addiction is a brain disease , we still have no neural circuit-based treatments for substance dependence or cue reactivity at large. Now , for the first time , it appears that a noninvasive brain stimulation technique known as transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS) , which is Food and Drug Administration approved to treat depression<symptom> , may be the first tool available to fill this critical void in addiction treatment development. The goals of this review are to 1) introduce TMS as a tool to induce causal change in behavior , cortical excitability , and frontal-striatal activity; 2) describe repetitive TMS ( rTMS) as an interventional tool; 3) provide an overview of the studies that have evaluated rTMS as a therapeutic tool for alcohol and drug use disorders; and 4) outline a conceptual framework for target selection when designing future rTMS clinical trials in substance use disorders. The manuscript concludes with some suggestions for methodological innovation , specifically with regard to combining rTMS with pharmacotherapy as well as cognitive behavioral training paradigms. We have attempted to create a comprehensive manuscript that provides the reader with a basic set of knowledge and an introduction to the primary experimental questions that will likely drive the field of TMS treatment development forward for the next several years.
