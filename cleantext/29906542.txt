  Adherence of pathogen to nasal mucosa and colonization is the first step of bacterial biofilm ( BBF) formation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS). Terminal sialic acids presenting on cell surface are potential targets for bacterial binding , thus may partly contribute to the pathogenesis of CRS. However , little has been published in this respect , the purpose of our study aimed to investigate the expression of sialic acids on the nasal mucosa in CRS patients and its possible effect on BBF formation. Sinus mucosa were harvested from CRS patients undergoing endoscopic surgery. The positive of BBF formation were detected by scanning electronic microscopy ( SEM) and the expression of Neu5Acα2 ,3 Gal ( α2,3-linked sialic acid) and Neu5Acα2 ,6 Gal ( α2,6-linked sialic acid) on nasal mucosa were determined by fluorescent-immunohistochemical staining ( F-IHC) with MAL-II and SNA respectively. A semi-quantitative scoring system was used to assess their different expression between CRS group and the control , as well as BBF positive and negative group. Expression of Neu5Acα2 ,3 Gal and Neu5Acα2 ,6 Gal were both detected in the epithelium and submucosal glands of all 40 CRS patients and 23 controls , they were significantly up-regulated in CRS group ( p < 0.05). Among 24 CRS patients , typical BBF formation were identified in 13 cases while the other 11 were regarded as negative , Between the subgroup of BBF ( +) and BBF (-) , both of Neu5Acα2 ,3 Gal and Neu5Acα2 ,6 Gal had a trend of increasing in BBF ( +) group , however , the increased expression of Neu5Acα2 ,3 Gal was statistical significance ( 4.77 ± 0.90 versus 3.45 ± 1.40; p = 0.0282) , whereas the difference of Neu5Acα2 ,6 Gal was insignificant ( 4.15 ± 1.27 versus 3.55 ± 1.59; p = 0.4281). Expression of MAL-II binding ( most probable Neu5Acα2 ,3 Gal) and SNA binding ( Neu5Acα2 ,6 Gal) were up-regulated in inflamed nasal mucosa , and the increased expression of them may contribute to bacterial biofilm formation which deserved a further investigation.
