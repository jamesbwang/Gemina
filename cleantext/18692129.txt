  Superoxide dismutases ( SODs) constitute a very important antioxidant defense against oxidative stress in the body. The enzyme acts as a good therapeutic agent against reactive oxygen species-mediated diseases. The present review describes the therapeutic effects of SOD in various physiological and pathological conditions such as cancer , inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> , cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> , ischemia , aging , rheumatoid arthritis<disease> , neurodegenerative diseases , and diabetes. However , the enzyme has certain limitations in clinical applications. Therefore , SOD conjugates and mimetics have been developed to increase its therapeutic efficiency. Here , an overview is provided of some in vivo therapeutic effects observed with SOD.
