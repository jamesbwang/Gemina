  Research suggests the sense of belonging to primary groups functions as an important social resource for youth well-being , but it can be compromised among those dealing with addiction. The current study examined how adolescents ' and emerging adults ' identification with a primary peer group consisting of friends , mediates the relationship between addictive behaviors and psychological distress. The study utilized demographically balanced survey data on 1200 Finnish participants aged 15 to 25 ( mean age 21.29 , 50 % female). Measures were included for psychological distress , excessive drinking , excessive drug use , excessive gambling , excessive Internet use , and peer group identification. All forms of addictive behaviors had a significant direct relationship with higher psychological distress. Excessive drug use , gambling and Internet use were associated with a weaker identification with a peer group , which predicted higher psychological distress. Contrary to the above findings , excessive drinking was linked to stronger peer group identification , mediating psychological distress downwards. These findings support past research and provide a mediation model explanation onto how weaker social relations add to negative well-being consequences in different addictive behaviors , thus underlining the importance of expanding our understanding of social group outcomes among young individuals.
