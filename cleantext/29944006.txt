  Alcohol , tobacco , and other drug use form a risk factor for health and social problems during adolescence. From a socio-ecological model , perceptions of 85 young people and 10 stakeholders on the types of alcohol , tobacco , and other drugs used and the predisposing and protective factors were explored; among adolescents at the Kenyan Coast in the Kilifi County. We found that the consumption of home-brewed alcohol , tobacco and marijuana smoking , and khat chewing was common and requires multi-component and community-centered intervention. Countering alcohol , tobacco , and other drug use needs enforcement of strong measures to regulate access to alcohol , tobacco , and other drugs for minors; addressing social and cultural norms; strategies for poverty alleviation; and community empowerment.
