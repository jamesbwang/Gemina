  Rhabdomyosarcomas ( RMSs) are the most frequent soft tissue sarcoma<disease> in children and adolescents , defined by skeletal muscle differentiation and the status of FOXO1 fusions. In pediatric malignancies , in particular RMS , scant and controversial observations are reported about PD-L1 expression as a putative biomarker and few immune checkpoint clinical trials are conducted. PD-L1 assessment was evaluated by immunohistochemistry ( IHC) utilizing two anti-PDL1 antibodies , in a pilot cohort of 25 RMS. Results were confirmed in primary and commercial RMS cell lines by cytofluorimetric analysis and IHC. PD-L1 expression was detectable , by both anti-PD-L1 antibodies , in the immune contexture of immune cells infiltrating and/or surrounding the tumor , in 15/25 ( 60 %) RMS , while absent expression was observed in neoplastic cells. Flow cytometry analysis and PD-L1 IHC of commercial and primary RMS cell lines confirmed a very small percentage of PD-L1 positive-tumor cells , under the detection limits of conventional IHC. Interestingly , increased PD-L1 expression was observed in the immune contexture of 4 RMS cases post chemotherapy compared to their matched pre-treatment samples. Here we identify a peculiar pattern of PD-L1 expression in our RMS series with scanty positive-tumor cells detected by flow cytometry , and recurrent expression in the immune cells surrounding or infiltrating the tumor burden.
