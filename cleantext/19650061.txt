  DNA methylation is the most characterized epigenetic process exhibiting stochastic variation across different tissues and individuals. In non-invasive prenatal testing ( NIPT) fetal specific methylated regions can potentially be used as biomarkers for the accurate detection of fetal aneuploidies. The aim of this study was the investigation of inter-individual methylation variability of previously reported fetal-specific markers and their implementation towards the development of a novel NIPT assay for the detection of trisomies 13 , 18 , and 21. Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation ( MeDIP) combined with in-solution targeted enrichment followed by NGS was performed in 29 CVS and 27 female plasma samples to assess inter-individual methylation variability of 331 fetal-specific differentially methylated regions ( DMRs). The same approach was implemented for the NIPT of trisomies 13 , 18 and 21 using spiked-in ( n = 6) and pregnancy samples ( n = 44) , including one trisomy 13 , one trisomy 18 and four trisomy 21. Despite the variability of DMRs , CVS samples showed statistically significant hypermethylation ( p < 2e-16) compared to plasma samples. Importantly , our assay correctly classified all euploid and aneuploid cases without any false positive results ( n = 44). This work provides the starting point for the development of a NIPT assay based on a robust set of fetal specific biomarkers for the detection of fetal aneuploidies. Furthermore , the assay 's targeted nature significantly reduces the analysis cost per sample while providing high read depth at regions of interest increasing significantly its accuracy.
