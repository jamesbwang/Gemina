  This study assessed the protective effect of melatonin against muscle atrophy provoked by chronic immobilization stress ( CIS). CIS was induced in rats by limiting their trunk movement for 90 min daily for 6 weeks. Rats subjected to the CIS procedure demonstrated a substantial decrease in body<symptom> weight , an increase in serum corticosterone , muscle atrophy , and an increase in atrogin-1 mRNA levels. An increase in the serum lactate-to-pyruvate ratio and the oxidative stress accompanied by a reduction of Na
