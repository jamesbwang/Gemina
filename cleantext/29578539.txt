  In the version of this article initially published , the '' ( 13C2) α-ketoglutarate '' label on Fig. 1g is incorrect. It should be '' ( 13C5) α-ketoglutarate ''. Additionally , in Fig. 3b , the `` AAV-GFP '' group is missing a notation for significance , and in Fig. 3c , the `` AAV-GLS2-sh '' group is missing a notation for significance. There should be a double asterisk notating significance in both panels. Finally , in the Fig. 4g legend , '' ( 13C6) UDP-glucose '' should be '' ( 13C3) UDP-glucose '' , and in the Fig. 4h legend , '' ( 13C6) hexose '' should be '' ( 13C3) hexose ''. The errors have been corrected in the HTML and PDF versions of this article.
