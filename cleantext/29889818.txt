  Hypoxemia<symptom> and tissue ischemia during hemorrhage<symptom> as well as formation of oxygen and nitrogen radicals during resuscitation promote hyperinflammation and , consequently , trigger severe multiple-organ-failure ( MOF). Individuals diagnosed with stress-related disorders or reporting a life history of psychosocial stress are characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation<symptom> and a reduced glucocorticoid ( GC) signaling. We hypothesized that exposure to chronic psychosocial stress during adulthood prior to hemorrhagic shock<symptom> increases oxidative/nitrosative stress and therefore the risk of developing MOF in mice. To induce chronic psychosocial stress linked to mild immune activation and reduced GC signaling in male mice , the chronic subordinate colony housing ( CSC) paradigm was employed. Single-housed ( SHC) mice were used as controls. Subsequently , CSC and SHC mice were exposed to hemorrhagic shock<symptom> following resuscitation to investigate the effects of prior psychosocial stress load on survival , organ function , metabolism , oxidative/nitrosative stress , and inflammatory readouts. An increased adrenal weight in CSC mice indicates that the stress paradigm reliably worked. However , no effect of prior psychosocial stress on outcome after subsequent hemorrhage<symptom> and resuscitation could be detected. Chronic psychosocial stress during adulthood is not sufficient to promote hemodynamic complications , organ dysfunction , metabolic disturbances and did not increase the risk of MOF after subsequent hemorrhage<symptom> and resuscitation. Intravenous norepinephrine to keep target hemodynamics might have led to a certain level of oxidative stress in both groups and , therefore , disguised potential effects of chronic psychosocial stress on organ function after hemorrhagic shock<symptom> in the present murine trauma model.
