  Sepsis<disease> leads to systemic inflammatory response with cerebral blood flow ( CBF) alteration and blood-brain barrier disruption that contribute to sepsis-associated encephalopathy ( SAE). We aimed to evaluate cord blood neuron-specific enolase ( cNSE) and CBF in early-onset neonatal<disease> sepsis<disease> ( EONS) as predictors of SAE and to define short-term neurodevelopmental outcomes among survivors. cNSE was measured in 200 neonates with antenatal risk factors for EONS , stratified into two groups: sepsis<disease> ( n = 96) and no-sepsis ( n = 104). Trans-cranial Doppler of peak systolic velocities ( PSV) , end diastolic velocities ( EDV) and resistive indices ( RI) of anterior ( ACA) and middle ( MCA) cerebral arteries recorded on day 1 postnatal. Griffiths mental developmental scale ( GMDS) was assessed at 6 months. Increased cNSE , PSV , EDV , and decreased RI of both ACA and MCA were found in sepsis<disease> group compared to no-sepsis group ( p < 0.001 for all). Patients with SAE ( n = 34) had higher NSE , PSV , and EDV as well as lower RI of ACA and MCA compared to those without ( p < 0.01 for all). SAE neonates had lower GMDS than those without. ACA RI of â‰¤ 0.61 was the best predictor of SAE. High CBF and cNSE could be useful markers for prediction of SAE. SAE impairs neurodevelopmental scales at 6 months.
