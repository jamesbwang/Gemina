  A novel method of selecting a subset of Bloch modes in silicon-based photonic crystal microring resonators ( PhCR) s is demonstrated. Bloch modes in the PhCR are calculated , and their intensity beating patterns are analyzed. Based on the different spatial intensity distribution for each resonance , a subset of resonances is out-coupled using an output coupler waveguide ( CWG) which is positioned at an angle θ = 90 ° with respect to the input CWG. As shown in theory and experiment , resonances with an even mode number are selected , while resonances with an odd mode number are rejected. The highest contrast between mode selection and mode rejection is ∼ 9 dB in the experiments. This approach opens another design freedom for ring resonator-based devices and could potentially reduce the footprint of microring resonator-based multiplexers and add-drop filters.
