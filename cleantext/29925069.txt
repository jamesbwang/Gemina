  Diabetic nephropathy has become the most common cause of chronic kidney disease ( CKD). Despite the progress accomplished in therapy , the prevalence of renal disorders remains high. Some modifiable factors driving the increase in incidence of CKD , in diabetes and other settings , might have been overlooked. Consistent evidence supports a role for vasopressin , hydration state , and urine concentration in kidney health. Plasma vasopressin is elevated in diabetes , even if metabolic control is good. Several epidemiological studies have pointed to a positive association between markers of vasopressin secretion ( 24-h fluid intake , urine volume , plasma copeptin concentration) and renal function decline in both the community and populations at high risk of CKD , namely , diabetic patients. Research involving animal models also supports a critical causal role of the V2 receptor antidiuretic effects of vasopressin in the early signs of kidney disease associated with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Key Messages: Data supporting the detrimental effects of chronic vasopressin action on the kidney is consistent in animal models and human observational studies. Since vasopressin secretion can be modulated by water intake , and its actions by selective receptor antagonists , the vasopressin-hydration system could be a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Intervention studies are needed to examine the relevance of lifestyle or pharmacological interventions.
