  Neonates have an immature immune system; therefore , their immune activities are different from the activities of adult immune systems. Such differences between neonates and adults are reflected by cell population constitutions , immune responses , cytokine production , and the expression of cellular/humoral molecules , which contribute to the specific neonatal microbial susceptibility and atopic properties. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) have been discovered to modulate many aspects of immune responses. Herein , we summarize the distinct manifestations of the neonatal immune system , including cellular and non-cellular components. We also review the current findings on the modulatory effects of miRNAs on the neonatal immune system. These findings suggest that miRNAs have the potential to be useful therapeutic targets for certain infection or inflammatory conditions by modulating the neonatal immune system. In the future , we need a more comprehensive understanding in regard to miRNAs and how they modulate specific immune cells in neonates.
