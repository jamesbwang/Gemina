  ω-Hydroxyundec-9-enoic acid ( ω-HUA) was reported as a valuable medium-chain fatty acid with industrial potentials. For bioconversion of ricinoleic acid to ω-HUA , in this study , an alcohol dehydrogenase ( Adh) from Micrococcus<pathogen> luteus<pathogen> , a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase ( BVMO) from Pseudomonas<pathogen> putida<pathogen> KT2440 and an esterase ( Pfe1) from Pseudomonas<pathogen> fluorescens<pathogen> SIK WI were overexpressed in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> BL21 ( DE3). In order to enhance accessibility of Pfe1 to the ( E) -11- ( heptanoyloxy) undec-9-enoic acid ( 11-HOUA) substrate , a truncated PelB signal sequence without the recognition site of signal peptidase ( tPelB) was attached to the N-terminus of Pfe1 , resulting in the construction of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> AB-tPE strain expressing Adh , BVMO and the tPelB-Pfe1 fusion protein. A batch-type biotransformation of ricinoleic acid by E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> AB-tPE resulted in 1.8- and 2.2-fold increases in ω-HUA conversion yield and productivity , respectively , relative to those for the control strain without the PelB sequence ( AB-E). By fed-batch-type biotransformation with glycerol feeding , the AB-tPE strain produced 23.7 mM ( equivalent to 4.7 g/L) of ω-HUA with 60.8 % ( mol/mol) of conversion yield and 1.2 mM/h of productivity , which were 13.2 , 2.9 , and 2.6 times higher than those in a batch-type biotransformation using the AB-E strain. In conclusion , combination of the truncated PelB-Pfe1 fusion and fed-batch process with glycerol feeding provided the highest efficiency of ω-HUA biotransformation , of which strategies might be applicable for biotransformation of hydrophobic substances.
