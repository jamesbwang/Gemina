  A Ru ( II)- Re ( I) supramolecular photocatalyst and a Ru ( II) redox photosensitizer were both deposited successfully on a NiO electrode by using methyl phosphonic acid anchoring groups and the electrochemical polymerization of the ligand vinyl groups of the complexes. This new molecular photocathode , poly-RuRe/NiO , adsorbed a larger amount of the metal complexes compared to one using only methyl phosphonic acid anchor groups , and the stability of the complexes on the NiO electrode were much improved. The poly-RuRe/NiO acted as a photocathode for the photocatalytic reduction of CO
