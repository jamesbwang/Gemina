  Humans are exposed either deliberately or unintentionally to a variety of diverse chemicals that harm the kidney. To reduce the alarming high incidence of nephrotoxicity , some chemical as well as herbal alternatives are needed. Nimesulide belongs to a group of antiinflammatory drugs that are in common use in our society. Like all non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs , it carries a potential threat of nephrotoxicity especially when other risk factors are present in user. The objective of this study was to find herbal alternative with antiinflammatory and nephroprotective qualities and to bring into light its mechanism of nephroprotection. This experimental study was conducted on mice at National Institute of Health , Islamabad from Feb 2013 to March 2014. Nimesulide was given in a dosage of 750 mg/kg body<symptom> weight for 3 days to induce nephrotoxicity and protective effect of Picrorhiza kurroa was noted in two doses of 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg for 14 days. Renal function tests were done and urinary PGE2 was measured to assess the effect of nimesulide and Pk on kidneys. In our study , significant improvement was seen in serum urea and creatinine levels in mice receiving low and high dose Picrorhiza kurroa. However , no significant improvement was noted in urinary PGE2 showing that the mechanism of nephroprotection is not by vasodilatory effect of Pk. This study showed nimesulide nephrotoxic potential and Pk is a good herbal antiinflammatory and nephroprotective alternative for nimesulide but its mechanism of nephroprotection is not by PGE2.
