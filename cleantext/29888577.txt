  To observe the immunoregulatory effect of electroacupuncture ( EA) intervention for muscular dystrophy chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) rats , so as to investigate its underlying mechanism in improving respiratory function. Forty male SD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: normal , model , EA , exercise , and EA + exercise ( After 80 days ' exposure to the cigarette smoke , the rats ' body<symptom> weight values in the model , EA , exercise and EA + exercise groups were significantly lower than that of the normal group ( EA intervention can improve the pulmonary function and pathological changes in pulmonary muscular dystrophy COPD rats , which is associated with its effects in reducing pulmonary monocytes and lymphocytes and serum TNF-α , IL-6 and IL-1 β contents , suggesting an enhancement of immunoregulation.
