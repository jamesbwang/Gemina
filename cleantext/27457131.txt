  With volatile fatty acids as substrates , the typical polyhydroxyalkanoates ( PHAs) production by mixed culture always includes two steps: PHA-storing culture enrichment via aerobic dynamic feeding strategy and PHA accumulation under nutrient-limited condition. To simplify the PHA-production steps , the enrichment and accumulation step were coupled in a SBR. At start-up period , to investigate the effect of settling selection , one acetate-fed SBR was operated by settling selection-double growth limitation ( SS-DGL) strategy , while the other was operated by DGL strategy. The results showed that the stable operation in SBR1 was obtained at about 21 , 12 days faster than SBR2 , implying the settling selection accelerated the start-up process. After omitting the settling selection under the stable operation , the SBR1 was run above 15 days. The results showed that the performance was not substantial altered. Therefore , the settling selection affected the start-up process but not the stable operation. At operational period , based on the sharp decreasing of oxygen uptake rate ( OUR) , the poly-Î²-hydroxybutyrate ( PHB) content was improved 13 % , from 70 to 83 % by feed-on-demand control-double growth limitation ( FD-DGL). And the harvested volumetric productivity was 5.0 gPHB/L/day , almost 1-folder improvement. That was to say , the PHB production in a SBR of coupling the enrichment and accumulation step was improved by feed-on-demand control. Meanwhile , the FD experiment can keep steady running for 10 SRTs. Therefore , the SS-DGL/FD-DGL strategy was a promising method for PHA production.
