  Diabetes currently affects more than 400 million people worldwide. This metabolic disorder causes various micro- and macrovascular complications that accelerate atherosclerosis and yet trigger other cardiovascular diseases. The characteristic frame of hyperglycaemia , hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia in diabetes increases several inflammatory mediators leading to endothelial dysfunction and pro-atherosclerotic processes. This MiniReview summarizes evidence that antidiabetic drugs have effects beyond lowering glycaemic levels. In experimental studies , antidiabetic drugs reduce the vascular production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines , the recruitment , infiltration and activation of immune cells and pro-inflammatory mediators , thus decreasing vascular inflammatory responses; they also re-establish vascular redox homeostasis by reducing oxidative stress and balancing the release of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator factors , hence contributing to the improvement of endothelial function. These effects are associated with a reduction in vascular remodelling due to decreased matrix metalloproteinases expression/activity , reduced inflammatory processes and vascular wall fibrosis<disease>. In clinical studies , antidiabetic drugs also reduce the production and release of pro-inflammatory , pro-atherosclerotic and pro-oxidative mediators and improve flow-mediated dilatation , indicating beneficial effects on endothelial function. These bonus effects of antidiabetic drugs may delay and/or reduce the installation and development of the atherosclerotic disease , decrease cardiovascular risk and possibly impact mortality risk , life expectancy and quality.
