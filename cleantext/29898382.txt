  Nitric oxide ( NO) deficiency is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Nitrite , a NO donor , is considered as a new therapeutic agent in diabetes. This study aims at determining effects of long-term nitrite administration on browning of white adipose tissue ( WAT) in type 2 diabetic rats. Male rats were divided into 4 groups: Control , control + nitrite , diabetes , and diabetes + nitrite. Sodium nitrite ( 50 mg/L in drinking water) was administered for 3 months. Body<symptom> weight was measured weekly. Fasting serum levels of glucose and nitric oxide metabolites ( NOx) were measured monthly. Histological evaluations and measurement of cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP) and NOx levels in adipose tissue were done at the end of the study. Nitrite decreased serum glucose concentration and body<symptom> weight gain in diabetic rats by 27.6 % and 37.9 % , respectively. In diabetic rats , nitrite increased NOx and cGMP levels in inguinal WAT by 95.7 % and 33.1 % , respectively. Numerical density in WAT of nitrite-treated diabetic rats was higher than in diabetic ones ( 995 ± 83 vs. 2513 ± 256 cell/mm Favorable effects of long-term nitrite administration in obese type 2 diabetic rats is , at least in part , due to browning of WAT and also associated with increased NOx and cGMP level in adipose tissue. These findings may have potential applications for management of diabesity.
