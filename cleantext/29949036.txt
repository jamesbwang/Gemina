  The aim was to design an app-based eLearning tool to provide radiographers with information about the physical basis of MR artefacts and practical elimination or/and minimisation strategies to optimise image quality , and to evaluate the impact of a smartphone app on radiographers ' knowledge. The study used the comparison-experimental approach ( pre- and post-test). Thirty-five MR radiographers independently reviewed a prepared series of MR images ( n = 25). The participants were requested to identify image quality related errors , to specify error-correction strategies and to score how confident they were in their responses. Participants were then divided into experimental ( n = 19) and control cohorts ( n = 16). The app was provided to the experimental cohort for 3 months; after this period both cohorts re-reviewed the MR image datasets and repeated their identification of image quality errors. The results showed a statistically significant difference between control and experimental cohorts relative to participants ' pre- to post-test knowledge level. For the experimental cohort , years of experience , qualification and type of hospital were not associated with radiographer knowledge level and confidence in recognising the presence of an image quality error , naming the error and specifying appropriate correction strategies ( p > 0.05). The study identified the potential of the smartphone app as an effective educational tool to support MR radiographers ' knowledge in recognising and characterising MR image quality errors. • A high level of knowledge to optimise MR image quality is crucial. • Ongoing education in image quality optimisation is required. • The potential role of app as an effective educational tool is identified.
