  The problem of electrostatic interactions between colloidal particles in an electrolyte solution has been solved within the Debye-HÃ¼ckel approximation using the boundary condition of constant potential. The model has been validated in two independent ways- by considering the limiting cases obtained from DLVO theory and comparison with the available experimental data. The presented methodology provides the final part of a complete theory of pairwise electrostatic interactions between spherical colloidal particles; one that embraces all possible chemical scenarios within the boundary conditions of constant potential and constant charge.
