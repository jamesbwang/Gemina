  It is understood that adversity during development has the power to alter behavioral trajectories , and the role of the epigenome in that relationship is currently under intense investigation. Several studies in both nonhuman animals and humans have established a link between early adversity and epigenetic regulation of genes heavily implicated in the stress response , plasticity and cognition , and psychiatric disorders such as depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom>. Thus the relatively recent surge of studies centering on the epigenetic outcomes of stress has great potential to inform treatments and interventions for psychiatric disorder precipitated by early adversity. Here we review what we know and what we do not know , and suggest approaches to help further elucidate the relationship between early adversity , epigenetics , and behavior.
