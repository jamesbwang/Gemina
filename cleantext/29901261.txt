  Pain sensitivity and psychosocial issues are prognostic of poor outcome in acute neck disorders. However , knowledge of associations between pain sensitivity and ongoing pain and disability in chronic neck<symptom> pain<symptom> are lacking. We aimed to investigate associations of pain sensitivity with pain and disability at the 12-month follow-up in people with chronic neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. The predictor variables were: clinical and quantitative sensory testing ( cold , pressure); neural tissue sensitivity; neuropathic symptoms; comorbidities; sleep; psychological distress; pain catastrophizing; pain intensity ( for the model explaining disability at 12 months only); and disability ( for the model explaining pain at 12 months only). Data were analysed using uni- and multivariate regression models to assess associations with pain and disability at the 12-month follow-up ( n = 64 at baseline , n = 51 at follow-up). Univariable associations between all predictor variables and pain and disability were evident ( r > 0.3; p < 0.05) , except for cold and pressure pain<symptom> thresholds and cold sensitivity. For disability at the 12-month follow-up , 24.0 % of the variance was explained by psychological distress and comorbidities. For pain at 12 months , 39.8 % of the variance was explained primarily by baseline disability. Neither clinical nor quantitative measures of pain sensitivity were meaningfully associated with long-term patient-reported outcomes in people with chronic neck<symptom> pain<symptom> , limiting their clinical application in evaluating prognosis.
