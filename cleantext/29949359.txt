  The triplet excited state of thioxanthone produced by photolysis undergoes reversible triplet energy transfer with a trimethylene- linked benzothiophene-2-carboxanilide ring system. The ensuing electrocyclic ring closure of the anilide moiety produces a putative zwitterionic intermediate that is capable of expelling leaving groups ( LG-) from the C-3 position of the benzothiophene ring. Stern- Volmer quenching studies with cyclohexadiene as quencher furnish the rate constants for the triplet excitation transfer in the forward and reverse directions , which can be expressed as an equilibrium constant K = 0.058. Overall , the rate of triplet excited state reaction becomes K x kr = 5.7 x 104 s-1 for LG- = Cl- , where kr is the triplet decay rate of the C-3 chloro- substituted benzothiophene-2- carboxanilide , found through Stern-Volmer quenching. The high quantum efficiencies found for the trimethylene- linked systems are due to K x kr being competitive with triplet excited state decay of the thioxanthone of kd = 7.7 x 104 s-1. From Φisc = 0.68 , the overall expected quantum yield for direct photolysis should be 0.50 for LG- = Cl- as compared to 0.41 at 25 °C experimentally. Φ decreases with increasing basicity of the leaving group ( LG- = Cl- , ( EtO) PO- , PhCH CO- , PhS- , PhCH S- ,).
