  Geometric morphometrics allows for the characterization of shape using Cartesian geometric coordinates rather than linear or volumetric measurements , which are dependent upon size and are insufficient to capture geometric shape. By using landmarks on specimens , variations in position , orientation and scale between specimens can be removed to better compare variations in shape. This method has primarily been used in the fields of evolutionary biology and taxonomy. Here we describe how geometric morphometrics can be used to delineate variations in shape caused by teratogenic compounds in zebrafish.
