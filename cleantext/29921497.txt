  Scoparone is a biologically active constituent isolated from Artemisia capillaris and possesses a variety of pharmacological activities , such as anti-inflammatory , anti-tumor , anti-allergic and anti-cardiovascular activities. However , there are no studies focusing on the effects of scoparone against cardiac fibrosis<disease>. Therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of scoparone on Angiotensin II ( Ang II)- induced extracellular matrix ( ECM) remodeling and its possible mechanism in cardiac fibroblasts ( CFs). Our results demonstrated that scoparone effectively attenuated CFs proliferation in Ang II-stimulated CFs. Scoparone also prevented the differentiation of CFs to myofibroblasts and ECM proteins ( type I collagen and fibronectin) expression in Ang II-stimulated CFs. Furthermore , scoparone prevented Ang II-induced the activation of TGF-β1/ Smad signalling in CFs. Taken together , these studies indicated that scoparone attenuated Ang II-induced ECM remodeling in CFs , at least in part , by inhibiting TGF-β1/ Smad signalling. These findings suggest that scoparone may be used a novel therapeutic agent against cardiac
