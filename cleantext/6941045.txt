  The mechanisms that influence metastatic growth rates are poorly understood. One mechanism of interest known as concomitant tumour resistance ( CTR) can be defined as the inhibition of metastasis by existing tumour mass. Conversely , the presence of a primary tumour has also been shown to increase metastatic outgrowth , termed concomitant tumour enhancement ( CTE). The majority of studies evaluating CTR/CTE in preclinical models have relied on endpoint histological evaluation of tumour burden. The goal of this research was to use conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) , cellular MRI , and bioluminescence imaging to study the impact of a primary tumour on the development of brain metastases in a syngeneic mouse model. Here , we report that the presence of a 4T1 primary tumour significantly enhances total brain tumour burden in Balb/C mice. Using in vivo BLI/MRI we could determine this was not related to differences in initial arrest or clearance of viable cells in the brain , which suggests that the presence of a primary tumour can increase the proliferative growth of brain metastases in this model. The continued application of our longitudinal cellular and molecular imaging tools will yield a better understanding of the mechanism ( s) by which this physiological inhibition ( CTR) and/or enhancement ( CTE) occurs.
