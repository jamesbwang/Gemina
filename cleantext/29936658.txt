  Objective This qualitative study explored parent and patient navigator perspectives of home visitation as part of a childhood obesity program in a low-income , largely Latino population. Methods Three patient navigators and 25 parents who participated in a home-based , childhood obesity program participated in focus groups or interviews. Emergent themes were identified through content analysis of qualitative data. Results Three overall themes were identified. Patient navigators and parents perceived: ( 1) enabling characteristics of home-based program delivery which facilitated family participation and/or behavior change ( i.e. , convenience , increased accountability , inclusion of household members , delivery in a familiar , intimate setting , and individualized pace and content); ( 2) logistic and cultural challenges to home-based delivery which reduced family participation and program reach ( i.e. , difficulties scheduling visits , discomfort with visitors in the home , and confusion<symptom> about the patient navigator 's role); and ( 3) remediable home-based delivery challenges which could be ameliorated by additional study staff ( e.g. , supervision of children , safety concerns) or through organized group sessions. Both patient navigators and participating parents discussed an interest in group classes with separate , supervised child-targeted programming and opportunities to engage with other families for social support. Conclusions for Practice A home visitation program delivering a pediatric obesity prevention curriculum in Denver was convenient and held families accountable , but posed scheduling difficulties and raised safety concerns. Conducting home visits in pairs , adding obesity prevention curriculum to existing home visiting programs , or pairing the convenience of home visits with group classes may be future strategies to explore.
