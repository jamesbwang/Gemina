  Full-thickness skin grafting is a well-established technique in the reconstruction of various tissue defects and wounds<disease> However , lack of uniformity in the procedure of closing and securing the grafts has led to a wide range of different techniques. This article reviews the use of tie-over bolster dressings compared to basting sutures for the fixation and postsurgical immobilization of full-thickness skin grafts ( FTSGs) , discusses details of each method , and proposes a practice guideline for the closure of FTSGs. A traditional review of the literature was performed through a search of PubMed using the following keywords: full-thickness skin graft , FTSG , closure , suture , tie-over bolster , quilting , and bolster. The current literature regarding tie-over bolster dressings does not demonstrate improved outcomes compared to quilting sutures. The 2 techniques appear equivalent in terms of utility and outcome , both possessing distinct advantages and disadvantages. Despite minimal head-to-head studies between tie-over bolsters and quilting , the best evidence from the literature appears to show comparable results regarding graft take , cosmetic outcomes , and postoperative complications. Ultimately , the choice of using a tie-over bolster technique or quilting sutures relies on surgeon preference and anatomic location.
