  Adverse psychosocial experiences operate simultaneously to affect mental health and behavior. The current study used mixture modeling to identify subgroups of young adults based on experiences of four types of psychosocial adversity and characterize their associations with depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , world assumptions , substance use , and sexual risk behavior. Sexual assault , physical assault , and discrimination ( interpersonal adversity) showed similar patterns within each group but diverged from neighborhood disadvantage in two groups. Groups characterized by higher interpersonal adversity reported the most negative health outcomes. Findings highlight variations in the co-occurrence of adverse experiences and differential links to risky health behaviors and mental health.
