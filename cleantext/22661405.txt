  Successful adaptation to complex environments depends on the balance<symptom> of at least two systems: a flexible but slow goal-directed system encoding action-outcome associations and an efficient but rigid habitual system linking responses to preceding stimuli. Recent evidence suggests that the inferolateral prefrontal cortex ( ilPFC) , a region well known to contribute to cognitive control processes , may play a crucial role in the balance<symptom> of goal-directed and habitual responding. This evidence , however , comes mainly from correlational data and whether the ilPFC is indeed causally involved in the goal-directed vs. habitual control of behavior is unclear. Here , we used neuro-navigated theta-burst stimulation ( TBS) to either inhibit or enhance right ilPFC functionality before participants completed an instrumental learning task designed to probe goal-directed vs. habitual behavioral control. TBS did not affect overall learning performance. However , participants that had received inhibitory TBS were less able to adapt their behavior to altered task demands , indicating a shift from goal-directed towards more habitual control of behavior. Sham or excitatory TMS groups showed no such effect and were comparable in their performance to an unstimulated control group. Our findings indicate a causal role of the ilPFC in the balance<symptom> of goal-directed vs. habitual control of behavior.
