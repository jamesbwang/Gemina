  The structure and functioning of multidrug efflux systems provide us with a better understanding of the transport of various antibiotics , thus giving a path for the discovery of effective compounds for combating the multidrug resistance in Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> In the present study , a number of computational techniques have been used to search for an inhibitor for the RND efflux pump , AdeABC , of A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> targeting specifically its outermost component , i.e. , AdeC. We have prepared the three-dimensional structure for AdeC using MODELLER v9 .16 and identified its active binding site using SiteMap. Using high-throughput virtual screening , we identified compounds from a large library of biogenic compounds on the basis of their effective interaction at the binding site of AdeC. The validation of docking step was performed by plotting ROC curve ( enrichment calculations). The docked complexes were further analyzed for their binding free energies by molecular mechanics using Generalized Born model and Solvent Accessibility ( MMGBSA). The molecular dynamics simulation was performed for AdeC-ZINC77257599 complex using GROMACS. The present rational drug designing , molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics data provided an inhibitor , i.e , ZINC77257599 ( ( 3R ,4 Z ,6 E ,8 E) -3-hydroxy-2,2,4-trimethyl-10-oxazol-5-yl-deca-4,6,8-trienamide) , for the outer membrane protein component ( AdeC) of efflux pump AdeABC of
