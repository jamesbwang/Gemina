  Bone regeneration and reosseointegration around a dental implant were radiographically and histologically analyzed after regenerative treatment for peri-implantitis , using a case from a human autopsy. A block specimen including the tissue around the implants was obtained from the patient , who died from cancer 20 months after regenerative surgery using a synthetic bone substitute to treat peri-implantitis. Microcomputed tomographic and histologic analyses were performed. Three-wall intrabony defects at the implant placed at the site of the mandibular left first molar and a circumferential defect at the implant at the site of the mandibular left second molar were substantially filled with newly formed bone and residual bone substitute particles , and reosseointegration on the previously exposed implant surface was histologically observed.
