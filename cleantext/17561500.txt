  Bacterial resistance occurs by spontaneous mutations or horizontal gene transfer mediated by mobile genetic elements , which represents a great concern. Resistance to β-lactam antibiotics is mainly due to the production of β-lactamases , and an important mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance is the acquisition plasmid determinants. The aim of this study was to verify the presence of β-lactamase-encoding genes and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes in different water samples obtained from São Paulo state , Brazil. A high level of these resistance genes was detected , being the bla
