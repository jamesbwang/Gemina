  N‑terminal truncated peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor‑γ coactivator‑1α ( NT‑PGC‑1α) is an alternative splice variant of PGC‑1α. NT‑PGC‑1α exhibits stronger anti‑obesity effects in adipose tissue than PGC‑1α; however , NT‑PGC‑1α has not yet been investigated in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes ( NRCMs). The present study aimed to investigate the role of NT‑PGC‑1α in mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism and its possible regulatory mechanism in NRCMs. NRCMs were exposed to phenylephrine ( PE) or angiotensin II ( Ang II) to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Following this , NRCMs were infected with adenovirus<pathogen> expressing NT‑PGC‑1α , and adenosine 5 ' triphsophate ( ATP) levels , reactive oxygen species ( ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane potential were subsequently detected. In addition , western blotting , lipid droplet staining and oxygen consumption assays were performed to examine the function of NT‑PGC‑1α in fatty acid metabolism. NT‑PGC‑1α was demonstrated to be primarily expressed in the cytoplasm , which differed from full‑length PGC‑1α , which was predominantly expressed in the nucleus. NT‑PGC‑1α overexpression alleviated mitochondrial function impairment , including ATP generation , ROS production and mitochondrial membrane potential integrity. Furthermore , NT‑PGC‑1α overexpression alleviated the PE‑induced suppression of fatty acid metabolism‑associated protein expression , increased extracellular oxygen consumption and decreased lipid droplet accumulation in NRCMs. Taken together , the present study demonstrated that NT‑PGC‑1α alleviated PE‑induced mitochondrial impairment and decreased lipid droplet accumulation in NRCMs , indicating that NT‑PGC‑1α may have ameliorated mitochondrial energy defects in NRCMs , and may be considered as a potential target for the treatment of
