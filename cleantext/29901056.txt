  Thermodynamic temperature is a scalar. However , the connection with the kinetic energy tensor in statistical mechanics leaves open the possibility to define a tensorial temperature. This concept has sometimes been used to simulate isothermal conditions in out-of-equilibrium systems. Here , we show , by studying a sessile water droplet , that a tensorial temperature leads to the wrong thermodynamics , or , in other words , the equilibrium isothermal ensemble generated using a tensorial temperature is not the canonical one , with interfacial free energies that can differ up to 40 % from the correct ones.
