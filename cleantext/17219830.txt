  Central nervous system hemangioblastomas are generally restricted to the cerebellum , spinal cord , and brainstem. Supratentorial hemangioblastomas are uncommon , and optic nerve hemangioblastomas are extremely rare , with fewer than 25 reports including this case. In this report , we present the case of a 36-year-old woman with von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL) disease who presented with progressive diminution of vision in the left eye due to a retrobulbar<symptom> optic nerve hemangioblastoma. The patient had a history of cerebellar/spinal hemangioblastomas and pancreatic cysts<symptom> , and her father and brother were patients with VHL disease. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed intraorbital retrobulbar-enhanced mass on the left optic nerve. The optic nerve hemangioblastoma was treated with fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery using Novalis. Eighteen months after the stereotactic radiosurgery , the tumor volume decreased although the patient lost vision. This report presents an extremely rare case of optic nerve hemangioblastoma , which is the first case treated with stereotactic radiosurgery.
