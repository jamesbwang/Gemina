  Bakuchiol is a phytochemical that has demonstrated cutaneous anti-aging effects when applied topically. Early studies have suggested that bakuchiol is a functional analog of topical retinoids , as both compounds have been shown to induce similar gene expression in the skin and lead to improvement of cutaneous photodamage. No in vivo studies have compared the two compounds for efficacy and side effects. To compare the clinical efficacy and side effect profiles of bakuchiol to retinol in improving common signs of cutaneous facial aging. This was a randomized , double-blind , 12-week study in which 44 subjects were asked to apply either 0.5 % bakuchiol cream twice daily or 0.5 % retinol cream daily. A facial photograph and analysis system was used to obtain and analyze high-resolution photographs of subjects at 0 , 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks. Subjects also completed tolerability assessment questions to review side effects. During study visits , a board-certified dermatologist , blinded to study group assignments , graded pigmentation and redness. Bakuchiol and retinol both significantly decreased wrinkle surface area and hyperpigmentation , with no statistical difference between the compounds. The retinol users reported more facial skin scaling and stinging. Our study demonstrates that bakuchiol is comparable to retinol in its ability to improve photoaging and is better tolerated than retinol. Bakuchiol is promising as a more tolerable alternative to retinol. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
