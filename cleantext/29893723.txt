  Ultrathin films of β-tungsten provide very promising substrates for applications in spintronics , and the possibility of incorporating them into multilayers extends such expectations. Our calculations indicate that it is viable to deposit a single layer of Mn on two non-equivalent ( 001) surfaces of β-tungsten that have easy axes along orthogonal directions ( 010) and ( 100) , respectively. The ferromagnetic structure of this Mn monolayer adsorbed to either of those surfaces displays a giant in-plane magneto-crystalline anisotropy that exceeds 12 meV per Mn atom. Furthermore , when coated with additional layers of β-tungsten the magnetization easy axis becomes perpendicular to the planes. We envisage that magnetic multilayers involving mono-crystalline thin films of β-tungsten oriented along high-symmetry directions offer a very fruitful playground for spintronic applications.
