  Pulmonary hypertension ( PH) is defined as the mean pulmonary artery pressure ( mPAP) â‰¥ 25 mmHg under the sea level in resting state. ROCK1 and ROCK2 can be combined to cause the damage of vascular endothelial function. To explore the differences of ROCK1 and ROCK2 in subjects with pulmonary hypertension or normal pulmonary artery pressure in plateau area , and to further understand the mechanism of Rho/rho-kinase pathway activation for promoting pulmonary hypertension , we collected 64 patients with pulmonary hypertension and 87 normal pulmonary artery healthy controls. All subjects were hospitalized in Cardiology or Respiration Department of Qinghai Provincial Peoples ' Hospital from December 2016 to June 2017. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure was measured by Doppler ultrasound , and serum ROCK1 and ROCK2 levels were tested by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). We found that the serum ROCK2 concentration in the pulmonary hypertension group was significantly higher than that in the control group , but serum ROCK1 level had no significant difference. ROCK2 plays a leading role in pulmonary hypertension in the plateau region , so selective ROCK2 inhibitors will be more effective in improving pulmonary hypertension.
