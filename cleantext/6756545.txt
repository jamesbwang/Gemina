  Sympathetic premotor neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamus ( PVN) play a role in hemodynamics adjustments during changes in body fluid homeostasis. However , PVN contribution to the tonic control of cardiac function remains to be systematically studied. In this study , we assessed whether GABAergic and adrenergic synapses , known for being active in the PVN , are involved in the control of cardiac function. Adult male Wistar rats ( 250-350 g;
