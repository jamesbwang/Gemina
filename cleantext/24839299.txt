  Policymakers have focused on the food retail environment for improving the dietary quality for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP) participants. Yet little is known about where SNAP households make food and beverage purchases or how purchases may vary by store type , SNAP participation , and income level. The objective of this study was to examine the association between SNAP-income status ( participant , income-eligible non-participant , higher-income non-participant) and healthfulness of household purchases across store types. Data included household packaged food purchases ( N = 76,458 unique households) from 2010 to 2014 , analyzed in 2017 with multivariable adjusted models to examine the nutritional profile of purchases by store type ( grocery , convenience , big box , and other stores) for SNAP participating households , income-eligible non-participants , and higher-income non-participants. Outcomes included volume and nutrients ( kilocalories , total sugar , saturated fat , and sodium) and calories from food groups. All households purchased the greatest volume of foods and beverages from grocery stores , followed by big-box and other stores , with relatively little purchased from convenience stores. The largest differences between SNAP participants and non-participants were observed at grocery stores and big-box stores , where SNAP households purchased more calories from starchy vegetables , processed meat , desserts , sweeteners and toppings , total junk food , sugar-sweetened beverages , and milk , than income-eligible and higher-income SNAP non-participants. SNAP purchases also had considerably higher sodium density. Across store types , the nutritional profile of income-eligible non-participants ' purchases was similar to higher-income households ' purchases. More research is needed to identify strategies to improve the nutritional profile of purchases among SNAP households.
