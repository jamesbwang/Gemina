  The formation of a dural arteriovenous fistula<disease> ( DAVF) between inferolateral trunk ( ILT) and cavernous sinus ( CS) is very rare. This study presents a case of ILT-CS DAVF. A 64-year-old male patient had exophthalmos of the left eye with redness and swelling. Digital subtraction angiography ( DSA) revealed a connection between the ILT and the CS that formed a high-flow DAVF that was drained only to the ophthalmic vein and no other parts of the CS. The ILT was chosen as the transarterial path for treatment because it was enlarged. The microcatheter was navigated into the ILT , and two coils were then used to occlude the ILT. After occlusion of the ILT , no image of the DAVF indicated that the ILT-CS DAVF was completely cured. The patient 's symptoms improved gradually after surgery. At the 6-month follow-up visit , DSA showed no sign of ILT-CS DAVF , and the patient 's eye symptoms had disappeared. Although ILT-CS DAVF is rare , it still can be seen in clinical practice , and coiling the ILT via a transarterial approach is a good option for treatment.
