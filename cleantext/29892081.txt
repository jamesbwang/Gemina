  An organism 's entire protein modification repertoire has yet to be comprehensively mapped. N-myristoylation ( MYR) is a crucial eukaryotic N-terminal protein modification. Here we mapped complete Homo sapiens and Arabidopsis thaliana myristoylomes. The crystal structures of human modifier NMT1 complexed with reactive and nonreactive target-mimicking peptide ligands revealed unexpected binding clefts and a modifier recognition pattern. This information allowed integrated mapping of myristoylomes using peptide macroarrays , dedicated prediction algorithms , and in vivo mass spectrometry. Global MYR profiling at the genomic scale identified over a thousand novel , heterogeneous targets in both organisms. Surprisingly , MYR involved a non-negligible set of overlapping targets with N-acetylation , and the sequence signature marks for a third proximal acylation-S-palmitoylation-were genomically imprinted , allowing recognition of sequences exhibiting both acylations. Together , the data extend the N-end rule concept for Gly-starting proteins to subcellular compartmentalization and reveal the main neighbors influencing protein modification profiles and consequent cell fate.
