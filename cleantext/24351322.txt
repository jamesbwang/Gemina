  The oral delivery of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs is challenging due to low bioavailability , gastrointestinal side effects , first-pass metabolism and P-glycoprotein efflux pumps. Thus , chemotherapeutic drugs , including Docetaxel , are administered via an intravenous route , which poses many disadvantages of its own. Recent advances in pharmaceutical research have focused on designing new and efficient drug delivery systems for site-specific targeting , thus leading to improved bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. A decent number of studies have been reported for the safe and effective oral delivery of Docetaxel. These nanocarriers , including liposomes , polymeric nanoparticles , metallic nanoparticles , hybrid nanoparticles , dendrimers and so on , have shown promising results in research papers and clinical trials. The present article comprehensively reviews the research efforts made so far in designing various advancements in the oral delivery of Docetaxel. Different strategies to improve oral bioavailability , prevent first-pass metabolism and inhibition of efflux pumping leading to improved pharmacokinetics and anticancer activity are discussed. The final portion of this review article presents key issues such as safety of nanomaterials , regulatory approval and future trends in nanomedicine research.
