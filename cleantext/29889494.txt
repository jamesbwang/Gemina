  Chiral crystals consisting of microhelices have many optical properties , while presently available fabrication processes limit their large-scale applications in photonic devices. Here , by using a simplified simulation method , we investigate a bottom-up self-assembly route to build up helical crystals from the smectic monolayer of a colloidal helix racemate. With increasing the density , the system undergoes an entropy-driven cocrystallization by forming crystals of various symmetries with different helical shapes. In particular , we identify two crystals of helices arranged in binary honeycomb and square lattices , which are essentially composed of two sets of opposite-handed chiral crystals. Photonic calculations show that these chiral structures can have large complete photonic band gaps. In addition , in the self-assembled chiral square crystal , we also find dual polarization band gaps that selectively forbid the propagation of circularly polarized light of a specific handedness along the helical axis direction. The self-assembly process in our proposed system is robust , suggesting possibilities of using chiral colloids to assemble photonic metamaterials.
