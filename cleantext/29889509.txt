  The hetisine-type natural products exhibit one of the most complex carbon skeletons within the diterpenoid alkaloid family. The use of network analysis has enabled a synthesis strategy to access alkaloids in this class with hydroxylation on the A-ring. Key transformations include a benzyne acyl-alkylation to construct a key fused 6-7-6 tricycle , a chemoselective nitrile reduction , and sequential C-N bond formations using a reductive cyclization and a photochemical hydroamination to construct an embedded azabicycle. Our strategy should enable access to myriad natural and unnatural products within the hetisine-type.
