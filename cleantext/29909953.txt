  Asymptomatic bacteriuria ( ABU) should be treated only in pregnant women and before urological procedures that breach the mucosa. In all other clinical settings , treatment of ABU is not beneficial and only contributes to antibiotic-associated morbidity and the selection of antibiotic resistance; therefore , screening and treatment are not recommended.
