  Nuclear factor κB ( NF-κB) is a transcription factor important for regulating innate and adaptive immunity , cellular proliferation , apoptosis , and senescence. Dysregulation of NF-κB and its upstream regulator IκB kinase ( IKK) contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple inflammatory and degenerative diseases as well as cancer. An 11-amino acid peptide containing the NF-κB essential modulator ( NEMO)- binding domain ( NBD) derived from the C-terminus of β subunit of IKK , functions as a highly selective inhibitor of the IKK complex by disrupting the association of IKKβ and the IKKγ subunit NEMO. A structure-based pharmacophore model was developed to identify NBD mimetics by in silico screening. Two optimized lead NBD mimetics , SR12343 and SR12460 , inhibited tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α ( TNF-α)- and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced NF-κB activation by blocking the interaction between IKKβ and NEMO and suppressed LPS-induced acute<symptom> pulmonary<symptom> inflammation<symptom> in mice. Chronic treatment of a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD) with SR12343 and SR12460 attenuated inflammatory infiltration , necrosis<symptom> and muscle degeneration , demonstrating that these small-molecule NBD mimetics are potential therapeutics for inflammatory and degenerative diseases.
