  Purpose To improve diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis ( HS) in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy ( MTLE) by using MR fingerprinting and compare with visual assessment of T1- and T2-weighted MR images. Materials and Methods For this prospective study performed between April and November 2016 , T1 and T2 maps were obtained and tissue segmentation performed in consecutive patients with drug-resistant MTLE with unilateral or bilateral HS. T1 and T2 maps were compared between 33 patients with MTLE ( 23 women and 10 men; mean age , 32.6 years; age range , 16-60 years) and 30 healthy participants ( 20 women and 10 men; mean age , 28.8 years; age range , 18-40 years). Differences in individual bilateral hippocampi were compared by using a Wilcoxon signed rank test , whereas the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for difference analysis between healthy control participants and patients with MTLE. Results The diagnosis rate ( ie , ratio of HS diagnosed on the basis of a 2.5-minute MR fingerprinting examination compared with standard methods: MRI , electroencephalography , and PET) was 32 of 33 ( 96.9 %; 95 % confidence interval: 84.9 % , 100 %) , reflecting improved accuracy of diagnosis ( P = 1.92 Ã— 10
