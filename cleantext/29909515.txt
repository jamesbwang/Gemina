  Pregnancy after bariatric surgery ( BS) has an increased risk for small-for-gestational-age infants ( SGA) , shorter length of gestation , and probably perinatal mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate if biliopancreatic diversion could impair pregnancy outcomes in comparison to other bariatric surgery procedures. We conducted a cohort retrospective single-center study in 65 women before and after BS. Thirty-one pregnancies occurred before BS , while 109 after BS , amongst which n = 51 after biliopancreatic diversion ( BPD) and n = 58 after non-malabsorptive procedures. The pregnancy outcomes after BS in comparison with those before BS resulted less affected by diabetes , hypertensive disorders , macrosomia , and large-for-gestational-age ( LGA) , but more complicated by preterm births ( 14.5 versus 4.0 %) and low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( LBW) infants ( 28.9 versus 0 %). Moreover , mean birth weight resulted lower after BS than before BS ( p < 0.001). In pregnancies after BPD in comparison to those before BS , the LBW rate ( 42.5 %) resulted a drastic increase ( p < 0.001) , and mean birth weight ( p < 0.001) and mean birth weight centile ( p < 0.001) were lower after BPD. When pregnancy outcomes after BPD were compared with those after non-malabsorptive procedures , the rate of congenital anomalies , preterm births , LBW , and SGA resulted an increase ( p = 0.002 , 0.008 , 0.032 , and < 0.001 , respectively). BPD drastically reduced diabetes , hypertensive disorders , macrosomia , and LGA; however , it was associated with the poorest pregnancy outcomes in comparison to those observed after other BS procedures. On the basis of the present study , we recommend a cautious multidisciplinary selection of severely obese patients for BPD during the fertile age.
