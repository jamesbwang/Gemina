  The purpose of this study was to explore the correlation of insulin resistance ( IR) and leptin with inflammatory factors and vascular endothelial injury in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) complicated with coronary heart disease ( CHD) was explored. One hundred and fifty normal patients ( normal group) , 150 patients with pure T2DM ( T2DM group) and 150 patients with T2DM complicated with coronary heart disease ( T2DM + CHD group) were selected from Xi'an No. 5 Hospital. All the participants met our inclusion criteria. Age , body mass index , waist-to-hip ratio , blood lipid and fasting plasma glucose ( FPG) , of all the subjects were measured. Chemiluminescent immunoassay was adopted for the detection of FPG and double-antibody sandwich method was used for the determination of fasting plasma leptin , and assay of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6) and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α). Insulin resistance index ( IRI) was used to evaluate IR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was adopted for the detection of von Willebrand factor ( vWF) and endothelin ( ET-1). Compared with the control group , patients in the T2DM + CHD group and those in the T2DM group had higher homeostasis model assessment-IR , and higher assay of plasma leptin , hs-CRP , IL-6 and TNF-α ( P < 0.05) , and lower vascular endothelial function ( P < 0.05). Moreover , compared with the T2DM group , T2DM + CHD group had higher plasma leptin , and higher assay of hs-CRP , IL-6 and TNF-α ( P < 0.05). IRI was positively correlated with hs-CRP ( r = 0.521 , P = 0.001) , IL-6 ( r = 0.359 , P = 0.001) and TNF-α ( r = 0.386 , P = 0.001) , leptin was positively correlated with hs-CRP ( r = 0.305 , P = 0.001) , IL-6 ( r = 0.259 , P = 0.002) and TNF-α ( r = 0.429 , P = 0.001) , and IRI had no correlation with ET-1 ( r = 0.058 , P = 0.734) and vWF ( r = 0.047 , P = 0.812) , that is , it had no direct correlation with vascular endothelial function. Level of leptin was positively correlated with ET-1 ( r = 0.366 , P = 0.001) and vWF ( r = 0.471 , P = 0.001) , that is , it was negatively correlated with vascular endothelial function. Our results showed that leptin , hs-CRP , IL-6 and TNF-α are involved in the occurrence and development of CHD in patients with T2DM. IR has no direct correlation with the occurrence and development of CHD in patients with T2DM.
