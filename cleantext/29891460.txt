  To analyze the advantages of spatial measurement of anatomical parameters in a 3D model in surgical planning for laparoscopic partial nephrectomy ( LPN). From February , 2016 to October , 2017 , 37 patients diagnosed with T1 renal mass underwent LPN based on 3D reconstruction after enhanced CT scanning using the Uromedix-3D system ( group A) , and another 38 patients received LPN with conventional CT planning ( group B). The anatomical parameters were measured in the reconstructed 3D model and the demographic data , surgical outcome and postoperative data were compared between the two groups. In group A , the average time for 3D model reconstruction was ( 29.3 ∓ 9.7) min; the length , width and depth of the renal defect in 3D model were 3.2 ∓ 1.1 cm , 2.6 ∓ 0.9 cm and 1.7 ∓ 0.7 cm , respectively; The distance of the tumor from the collecting system was 3.8 ∓ 2.2 mm; The mean R.E.N.A.L score of the patients was 7 ∓ 1.5 , and 3 patients had accessory renal artery and 2 had early branching of the renal artery. LPNs were completed via the retroperitoneal approach in all the 75 patients without conversion to open or total nephrectomy. Group A and group B showed significant differences in warm ischemic time ( 26.7 ∓ 6.4 vs 31.9 ∓ 7.0 min) , tumor-excision time ( 8.4 ∓ 2.6 vs 10.4 ∓ 2.8 min) , renal defect suture time ( 18.3 ∓ 3.9 vs 21.5 ∓ 3.4 min) , 24-h volume of retroperitoneal drainage ( 88.6 ∓ 40.2 vs 134.3 ∓ 58.3 mL) and 48-h volume of retroperitoneal drainage ( 127.9 ∓ 54.5 vs 198.1 ∓ 86.3 mL) , but not in the demographic data , operation time , intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> or postoperative hospital stay. 3D reconstruction of the renal masses can be completed efficiently and accurately using this system. Compared with conventional CT-based measurement , 3D spatial measurement of the anatomical structures helps to increase the precision in the performance of LPN and reduce the warm ischemia time.
