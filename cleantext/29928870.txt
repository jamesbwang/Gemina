  Emotional events are preferentially retained in episodic memory. This effect is commonly attributed to enhanced consolidation and has been linked specifically to rapid eye movement<symptom> ( REM) sleep physiology. While several studies have demonstrated an enhancing effect of REM sleep on emotional item memory , it has not been thoroughly explored whether this effect extends to the retention of associative memory. Moreover , it is unclear how non-rapid eye movement<symptom> ( NREM) sleep contributes to these effects. The present study thus examined associative recognition of emotional and non-emotional material across an early morning nap ( N = 23) and sustained wakefulness ( N = 23). Nap group subjects demonstrated enhanced post-sleep associative memory performance , which was evident across both valence categories. Subsequent analyses revealed significant correlations between NREM spindle density and pre-sleep memory performance. Moreover , NREM spindle density was positively correlated with post-sleep neutral associative memory performance but not with post-sleep emotional associative memory. Accordingly , only neutral associative memory , but not emotional associative memory , was significantly correlated with spindle density after an additional night of sleep ( +24 h). These results illustrate a temporally persistent relationship between spindle density and memory for neutral associations , whereas post-sleep emotional associative memory appears to be disengaged from NREM-sleep-dependent processes.
