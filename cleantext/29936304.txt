  Platelet activation and aggregation have been conventionally evaluated using an aggregometer. However , this method is suitable for short-term but not long-term quantitative evaluation of platelet aggregation , morphological changes , and/or adhesion to specific materials. The recently developed digital holographic microscopy ( DHM) has enabled the quantitative evaluation of cell size and morphology without labeling or destruction. Thus , we aim to validate its applicability in quantitatively evaluating changes in cell morphology , especially in the aggregation and spreading of activated platelets , thus modifying typical image analysis procedures to suit aggregated platelets. Freshly prepared platelet-rich plasma was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 0.1 % CaCl
