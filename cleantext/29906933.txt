  Functional oscillator networks , such as neuronal networks in the brain , exhibit switching between metastable states involving many oscillators. We give exact results how such global dynamics can arise in paradigmatic phase oscillator networks: Higher-order network interactions give rise to metastable chimeras-localized frequency synchrony patterns-which are joined by heteroclinic connections. Moreover , we illuminate the mechanisms that underly the switching dynamics in these experimentally accessible networks.
