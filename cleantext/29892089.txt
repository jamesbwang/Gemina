  Almost all low-income countries and many middle-income countries lack the capacity to deliver medical genetics services. We developed the MiGene Family History App ( MFHA) , which assists doctors with family history collection and population-level epidemiologic analysis. The MFHA was studied at St. Paul 's Hospital in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia. A needs assessment was used to assess Ethiopian physicians ' experience with genetics services. The MFHA then collected patient data over a 6-month period. The majority of doctors provide genetics services , with only 16 % reporting their genetics knowledge is sufficient. A total of 1699 patients from the pediatric ward ( n = 367) , neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU) ( n = 477) , and antenatal clinic ( n = 855) were collected using the MFHA with a 4 % incidence of a MFHA-screened condition present. The incidence was 11.7 % in the pediatric ward , 3 % in the NICU , and 0.5 % in the antenatal clinic. Heart malformations ( 5.5 % of patients) and trisomy 21 ( 4.4 % of patients) were the most common conditions in the pediatric ward. Medical genetics services are needed in Ethiopia. As other countries increase their genetics capacity , the MFHA can provide fundamental genetics services and collect necessary epidemiologic data.
