  Peptide dendrimers are good candidates for diverse biomedical applications due to their biocompatibility and low toxicity. The local orientational mobility of groups with different radial localization inside dendrimers is important characteristic for drug and gene delivery , synthesis of nanoparticles , and other specific purposes. In this paper we focus on the validation of two theoretical assumptions for dendrimers: ( i) independence of NMR relaxations on excluded volume effects and ( ii) similarity of mobilities of side and terminal segments of dendrimers. For this purpose we study
