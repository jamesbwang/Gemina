  The Hedgehog ( Hh) signalling pathway is involved in cell differentiation , growth and tissue polarity. This pathway is also involved in the progression and invasion of various human cancers. Osteosarcoma , a subtype of bone cancer , is commonly seen in children and adolescents. Typically , pulmonary osteosarcoma metastases are especially difficult to control. In the present paper , we summarise recent studies on the regulation of osteosarcoma progression and metastasis by downregulating Hh signalling. We also summarise the crosstalk between the Hh pathway and other cancer-related pathways in the tumourigenesis of various cancers. We further summarise and highlight the therapeutic value of potential inhibitors of Hh signalling in the clinical therapy of human cancers.
