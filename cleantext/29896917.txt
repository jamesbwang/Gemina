  To explore the experiences of older people receiving home care package ( HCP) support following the introduction of consumer-directed care ( CDC) by the Australian government on 1 July 2015. Thirty-one older people with existing HCP support from two service providers in regional New South Wales , Australia , participated in a face-to-face interview and/or a qualitative survey. Analysis revealed the theme of Choices: Preferences , constraints , balancing and choosing. Participants described choosing to live at home with HCP support; however , they were constrained by poor communication and information about service changes and options , personal budgets and access to future care. HCP services remained largely unchanged during transition to CDC. Many aspects of the initial implementation of CDC were challenging for older people. Clear , relevant and timely communication and information about CDC and its consequences for consumers appear to be needed to enhance CDC.
