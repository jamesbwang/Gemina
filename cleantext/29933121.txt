  The Scarf osteotomy is a commonly used surgical procedure for treating hallux valgus in Europe. Screw fixation is standard practice , although some surgeons now go without internal fixation. Plate fixation is still being studied. The aim of this study was to compare the radiological outcomes of these fixation methods , which has not been performed up to now. Relative to screw fixation , plate fixation of a Scarf osteotomy of the first metatarsal ( M1) prevents secondary impaction , without increasing the complication rate or recurrence rate. A retrospective study was performed of two internal fixation methods for Scarf osteotomy ( screw vs plate) , by analyzing the secondary impaction of the first metatarsal , recurrence of the hallux valgus ( angle M1P1 > 20 °) on X-rays , incidence of complications and potential discomfort related to the hardware. The osteotomy procedure was the same in both groups: 50 patients were included consecutively in each fixation group between February 2014 and November 2015. The mean follow-up was 13.0 ± 2.7 months in the screw group and 12.3 ± 1.1 months in the plate group. There were no severe complications , although four cases of delayed wound<disease> healing occurred ( 3 in plate group , 1 in screw group). In the screw group , there was one case of secondary impaction , two cases of recurrence ( 4 %) and one case of discomfort. In the plate group , there were no cases of impaction , three recurrences ( 6 %) and five cases of discomfort , leading to plate removal in three of these cases. There was no significant difference between groups in the M1 secondary impaction rate or recurrence rate: screw fixation did not lead to a higher recurrence rate. Systematic fixation with a locked plate for Scarf osteotomy had no advantages over screw fixation in our study. III , Comparative study with continuous cohorts.
