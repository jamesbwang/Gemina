  Background/aim: In parallel with increased frequency and higher quality of imaging techniques , the prevalence of adrenal adenoma has gradually increased. However , despite the growing incidence , the metabolic and tumorigenesis processes involved in its etiology are still unclear. Although visfatin has been reported to be associated with inflammation<symptom> and tumorigenesis , its role in adrenal adenoma has not yet been investigated. Therefore , the present study was performed with an aim to evaluate visfatin levels and cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with adrenal adenoma. Materials and methods: Thirty patients recently diagnosed with adrenal adenoma along with 30 healthy participants were studied in a tertiary healthcare center. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> monitoring and carotid artery intima-media thickness ( CIMT) measurements were performed. Results: The frequencies of diabetes mellitus and hypertension were found to be statistically higher in the adrenal adenoma group. Although the values of mean fasting glucose , insulin , HOMA-IR levels , and the mean , maximum , minimum , delta systolic , and diastolic blood<symptom> pressures<symptom> were established to be higher in the adrenal adenoma group , the differences were not found to be statistically significant. Mean high-sensitive C-reactive protein , visfatin levels , and CIMT were seen to be significantly higher in the adenoma group. Conclusion: Cardiometabolic risk factors as well as the visfatin levels were established to be higher in patients with adrenal adenoma. Elevated visfatin levels might play a role in the development and metabolic process of adrenal adenoma.
