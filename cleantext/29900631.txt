  The Fourth Asia-Pacific Drosophila Research Conference ( APDRC4) was held at the convention center of Osaka University , Osaka , Japan , on May 8-11 , 2017. Derived from the Japanese Drosophila Research Conference , the APDRC visited its home for the first time since its launch in 2011 with APDRC1 in Taipei , followed by APDRC2 in Seoul and APDRC3 in Beijing. There were 344 participants from 18 countries , more than half of whom were from abroad ( Data S1). Two keynote speakers , Drs. Henry Sun and Daisuke Yamamoto , who have had rich science careers , gave overviews of their research. In addition , 14 invited speakers who are highly regarded in their fields introduced their new findings. Thirty-four oral presenters , many of them young investigators and students , were selected from the general participants to report their exciting results. During the conference , many stimulating questions and discussions were shared. Furthermore , 176 posters were presented , which also inspired enthusiastic discussions. In addition to the scientific presentations , a mixer and banquet enabled further intercommunion among the researchers ( Figure b , e). During the conference , it was decided that the next Asia-Pacific Drosophila Research Conference ( APDRC5) would be in Pune , India , in 2020. Thus , APDRC4 successfully achieved its mission to facilitate Drosophila research in the Asia-Pacific region.
