  Phylogenetic networks are a generalisation of phylogenetic trees that allow for more complex evolutionary histories that include hybridisation-like processes. It is of considerable interest whether a network can be considered ` tree-like ' or not , which leads to the introduction of tree-based networks in the rooted , binary context. Tree-based networks are those networks which can be constructed by adding additional edges into a phylogenetic tree , called the base tree. Previous extensions have considered extending to the binary , unrooted case and the nonbinary , rooted case. In this paper , we extend tree-based networks to the context of unrooted , nonbinary networks in three ways , depending on the types of additional edges that are permitted. Further , we study fully tree-based networks which are phylogenetic networks in which every embedded tree is a base tree. We also extend this concept to unrooted , nonbinary , phylogenetic networks and classify the resulting networks. Finally , we derive some results on the colourability of tree-based networks , which can be useful to determine whether a network is tree-based.
