  Oxidative stress ( OS) has been implicated as a pathophysiological mechanism of drug-resistant epilepsy , but little is known about the relationship between OS markers and clinical parameters , such as the number of drugs , age onset of seizure<symptom> and frequency of seizures<symptom> per month. The current study & rsquo; s aim was to evaluate several oxidative stress markers and antioxidants in 18 drug-resistant partial complex seizure<symptom> ( DRPCS) patients compared to a control group ( age and sex matched) , and the results were related to clinical variables. We examined malondialdehyde ( MDA) , advanced oxidation protein products ( AOPP) , advanced glycation end products ( AGEs) , nitric oxide ( NO) , uric acid , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , glutathione , vitamin C , 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal ( 4-HNE) and nitrotyrosine ( 3-NT). All markers except 4-HNE and 3-NT were studied by spectrophotometry. The expressions of 4-HNE and 3-NT were evaluated by Western blot analysis. MDA levels in patients were significantly increased (
