  Immune heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment undoubtedly adds several layers of complexity to our understanding of drug sensitivity and patient prognosis across various cancer types. Within the tumor microenvironment , immunogenicity is a favorable clinical feature in part driven by the antitumor activity of CD8 + T cells. However , tumors often inhibit this antitumor activity by exploiting the suppressive function of regulatory T cells ( Tregs) , thus suppressing the adaptive immune response. Despite the seemingly intuitive immunosuppressive biology of Tregs , prognostic studies have produced contradictory results regarding the relationship between Treg enrichment and survival. We therefore analyzed RNA-seq data of Treg-enriched tumor samples to derive a pan-cancer gene signature able to help reconcile the inconsistent results of Treg studies , by better understanding the variable clinical association of Tregs across alternative tumor contexts. We show that increased expression of a 32-gene signature in Treg-enriched tumor samples (
