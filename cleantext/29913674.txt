  Background Multiple chemical sensitivity ( MCS) is a chronic , disabling condition characterized by recurrent multisystem symptoms triggered by common airborne chemicals. Evidence points towards abnormal sensory processing in the central nervous system ( CNS) as a likely pathophysiological mechanism. No effective treatment has yet been reported , but clinical observations suggest that as pulsed electromagnetic fields ( PEMF) is a treatment for some CNS disorders ( depression<symptom> and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>) , it may also be a treatment modality for MCS. Methods In an open case study , the effects of PEMF were assessed in three MCS patients. All cases received 30 min daily treatment 5 days a week for 8 consecutive weeks. Symptoms and functional impairments related to MCS , depressive symptoms , and capsaicin-induced secondary punctate hyperalgesia were assessed at baseline and weekly until an 18-week follow-up. Results Two of the three cases showed considerable improvement on all measures of symptoms and functional impairments related to MCS in response to PEMF therapy. One case showed no improvement and during the treatment period was unexpectedly diagnosed with depression<symptom> Conclusion Our findings indicate potential benefits of PEMF therapy in MCS. Implication The therapeutic effect of PEMF in MCS needs to be investigated by a randomized placebo-controlled trial.
