  Mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR) is a master signaling pathway that regulates organismal growth and homeostasis , because of its implication in protein and lipid synthesis , and in the control of the cell cycle and the cellular metabolism. Moreover , it is necessary in cerebellar development and stem cell pluripotency maintenance. Its deregulation has been implicated in the medulloblastoma and in medulloblastoma stem cells ( MBSCs). Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant solid tumor in childhood. The current therapies have improved the overall survival but they carry serious side effects , such as permanent neurological sequelae and disability. Recent studies have given rise to a new molecular classification of the subgroups of medulloblastoma , specifying 12 different subtypes containing novel potential therapeutic targets. In this review we propose the targeting of mTOR , in combination with current therapies , as a promising novel therapeutic approach.
