  Objective Routine administrative data have been used to show that patients admitted to hospitals over the weekend appear to have a higher mortality compared to weekday admissions. Such data do not take the severity of sickness of a patient on admission into account. Our aim was to incorporate a standardized vital signs physiological-based measure of sickness known as the National Early Warning Score to investigate if weekend admissions are: sicker as measured by their index National Early Warning Score; have an increased mortality; and experience longer delays in the recording of their index National Early Warning Score. Methods We extracted details of all adult emergency medical admissions during 2014 from hospital databases and linked these with electronic National Early Warning Score data in four acute hospitals. We analysed 47,117 emergency admissions after excluding 1657 records , where National Early Warning Score was missing or the first ( index) National Early Warning Score was recorded outside Â± 24 h of the admission time. Results Emergency medical admissions at the weekend had higher index National Early Warning Score ( weekend: 2.53 vs. weekday: 2.30 , p < 0.001) with a higher mortality ( weekend: 706/11 ,332 6.23 % vs. weekday: 2039/35 ,785 5.70 %; odds ratio = 1.10 , 95 % CI 1.01 to 1.20 , p = 0.04) which was no longer seen after adjusting for the index National Early Warning Score ( odds ratio = 0.99 , 95 % CI 0.90 to 1.09 , p = 0.87). Index National Early Warning Score was recorded sooner ( -0.45 h , 95 % CI -0.52 to -0.38 , p < 0.001) for weekend admissions. Conclusions Emergency medical admissions at the weekend with electronic National Early Warning Score recorded within 24 h are sicker , have earlier clinical assessments , and after adjusting for the severity of their sickness , do not appear to have a higher mortality compared to weekday admissions. A larger definitive study to confirm these findings is needed.
