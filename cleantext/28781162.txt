  Diabetes education is believed to bring about sustained benefits in diabetes mellitus ( DM) patient outcomes. These benefits have not been widely studied in an inpatient hospital setting , and as such the aim was to determine whether a hospital diabetes in-service , and specifically diabetes education , results in reduced blood glucose and HbA1c levels after hospital discharge. A cohort review was performed at a large teaching hospital , in Canberra , Australia. Sixty seven patients comprising 35 males and 32 females who were referred upon discharge to the Diabetes Services as having a history of uncontrolled DM from February 1st The average discharge BGL result was 13.3 mmol/L , compared to the post-discharge result of 11.2 mmol/L , indicating a significant decrease ( This study is the first to measure the direct glucose adherence benefits associated DM education within Australia and provides evidence on the effectiveness of a Diabetes Service in reducing patient BGLs. Utilisation of Diabetes Services to control glycaemia encourages ongoing efforts and translates to reduced micro and macro cardiovascular risk factors associated with DM.
