  Donor/acceptor carbenes provide a powerful platform for building molecular complexity , but the majority of their reactions have been limited to aryl and vinyl donor groups. We found that a N-containing donor/acceptor carbene precursor , 4-phthalimido- N-methanesulfonyl-1,2,3-triazole , reacts with unactivated arenes resulting in a mixture of ( 3 +2)- cycloadducts , ( 3a ,7 a)- dihydroindoles , and formal C-H functionalization products in up to 82 % yield upon heating. We also demonstrate that the formal C-H functionalization products arise from ring-opening of the ( 3 +2)- cycloadducts. Computational studies suggest that the formal cycloaddition process takes places through a tandem arene cyclopropanation/6π electrocyclization/6π electrocyclic ring-opening/3 ,5-sigmatropic rearrangement reaction , which also accounts for the distinctive regioselectivity of the formal cycloaddition reaction.
