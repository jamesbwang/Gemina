  Toxocariasis is a neglected parasitic zoonosis that afflicts millions of the pediatric and adolescent populations worldwide , especially in impoverished communities. This disease is caused by infection with the larvae of Toxocara canis<pathogen> and T. cati , the most ubiquitous intestinal nematode parasite in dogs and cats , respectively. In this article , recent advances in the epidemiology , clinical presentation , diagnosis and pharmacotherapies that have been used in the treatment of toxocariasis are reviewed. Over the past two decades , we have come far in our understanding of the biology and epidemiology of toxocariasis. However , lack of laboratory infrastructure in some countries , lack of uniform case definitions and limited surveillance infrastructure are some of the challenges that hindered the estimation of global disease burden. Toxocariasis encompasses four clinical forms: visceral , ocular , covert and neural. Incorrect or misdiagnosis of any of these disabling conditions can result in severe health consequences and considerable medical care spending. Fortunately , multiple diagnostic modalities are available , which if effectively used together with the administration of appropriate pharmacologic therapies , can minimize any unnecessary patient morbidity. Although progress has been made in the management of toxocariasis patients , there remains much work to be done. Implementation of new technologies and better understanding of the pathogenesis of toxocariasis can identify new diagnostic biomarkers , which may help in increasing diagnostic accuracy. Also , further clinical research breakthroughs are needed to develop better ways to effectively control and prevent this serious disease.
