  To investigate the individualized learning plan ( ILP) as a tool in assessment of residents ' milestone achievements as they pertain to Otology subcompetencies: Chronic Ear Disease , Pediatric Otitis<disease> Media<disease> , and Hearing Loss. Prospective study. Twenty otolaryngology residents were instructed to use an ILP and identify six milestones from three otology-related subcompetencies to focus on during the course of a 3-month rotation. They were also asked to plan out specific activities which would help them achieve these milestones , to specify whether or not they successfully achieved them , by what instructional or learning methods and to identify any barriers. The completed ILPs were reviewed by a faculty member. The effectiveness of the ILP was assessed by response compliance rate , corroboration of self-reported milestone achievement with faculty evaluations and the ability to set attainable milestones. There was 95 % compliance in using an ILP to achieve milestones. Self-reported milestone scores corresponded to the faculty evaluations in a large majority ( 89.6 %) of patients , and tended to be underestimated by the residents. Out of 114 total milestones identified , 44 ( 38.6 %) were not achieved , with particular overestimation in the use of independent study as a learning method. The ILP is an effective tool in measuring residents ' achievement of otology-related milestones , and could possibly be used to supplement or replace faculty assessment. The ILP provides valuable information on barriers to achieving milestones and informs trainees on how to set attainable goals as they pertain to patient care and medical knowledge in otology.
