  Intraosseous lipomas occurring in the bones of the upper limbs are very rare. The tumor often occurs in long bones , especially the calcaneus. Usually patients with intraosseous lipomas present with mild clinical features. Thus far , bone destruction caused by the tumor has not been reported. The present study reported a case of an aggressive intraosseous lipoma that developed in the intermediate phalanges of the thumb. This is an extremely rare case with extraosseous development , which occurred at a rare site. A 47-year old woman presented to us with right thumb pain and swelling. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass extending to the outer edge of the phalangeal bone. The patient was treated with surgery the remove the tumor. Artificial bone was used to refill the area due to the lack of cancellous bone. During the clinical management of lipomas , it is important to consider that intraosseous lipomas may spread out of the bone; moreover , the tumor should be removed immediately to help reduce the possibility of bone destruction.
