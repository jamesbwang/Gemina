  Tattoos have a long history in the United States and the world. As dermatologists , we often treat patients who regret their tattoos and are seeking to have them removed. Laser technology allows for more effective tattoo removal. There are many unique risks to tattoo removal compared to general laser procedures , including paradoxical tattoo ink darkening and even allergic reactions to tattoo ink. Given the persistence of tattoos throughout history , this treatment challenge will likely persist for many years to come.
