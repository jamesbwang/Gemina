  Nematogenic liquids are materials that are in high demand for many application purposes. Field-induced nematic order in isotropic liquids can be observed by the enhancement of electric permittivity during dielectric spectroscopy measurements under the bias electric field. For this reason , dielectric measurements were done on a nematogenic mixture of highly polar compounds. This paper presents a discussion on the influence of the bias electric field on the dielectric response. We observed a decrease of electric permittivity in the isotropic phase under the bias electric field. This effect is most likely caused by the field-induced creation of some complex molecular objects. In the paper , relaxation parameters of the molecular modes were analyzed. The field-induced orientational order was determined using a dichroic ratio in a guest-host system. The measurements show the significant order parameter in the isotropic phase under an electric field.
