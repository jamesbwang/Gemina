  Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A2 ( PAPPA2) is a protease that cleaves IGF-binding protein ( IGFBP) -3 and IGFBP-5 , liberating free IGF-I. Five patients from two families with genetic mutations in To determine whether plasma transfusion or recombinant human ( rh) PAPPA2 could increase free IGF-I in patients with PAPPA2 deficiency or idiopathic short stature ( ISS). Single patient interventional study combined with Academic medical center. Three siblings with PAPPA2 deficiency and four patients with ISS. An adult female with PAPPA2 deficiency received a 20 mL/kg plasma transfusion. PAPPA2 , intact IGFBP-3 , and free and total IGF-I levels were monitored during 2 weeks. rhPAPPA2 was added to serum from patients with PAPPA2 deficiency and ISS Free IGF-I concentrations. Plasma transfusion resulted in a 2.5-fold increase of free IGF-I levels on day 1 posttransfusion with a return to baseline during a 2-week period. PAPPA2 plays a key role in regulation of IGF-I bioavailability. rhPAPPA2 is a promising therapy to increase free IGF-I levels both in patients with PAPPA2 deficiency as well as in patients with ISS.
