  There is little information on the effect of maternal characteristics and on-admission laboratory parameters to the therapeutic serum magnesium sulfate ( MgSO On-admission factors of 360 women with PE who received intravenous MgSO There was no seizure<symptom> or magnesium toxicity in this cohort. Median ( min-max) level of serum magnesium was 4.3 ( 2.5-8.4) mg/dL. Women in Group A ( n = 105) had lower gestational age , body mass index ( BMI) , and platelets count , higher blood urea nitrogen ( BUN) , serum creatinine , uric acid , direct bilirubin , aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , lactate dehydrogenase , prothrombin , and partial thromboplastin times than those in Group B ( n = 255) ( p < .05). Women with mild PE were less likely to attain therapeutic serum magnesium levels compared with those with severe phenotypes ( adjusted OR 23.57 , 95 % CI 8.20-67.76 versus adjusted OR 14.72 , 95 % CI 3.56-60.89 , respectively; p < .05) , which may be explained by their significantly lower serum BUN and uric acid ( p < .05). On-admission factors , especially BMI and renal clearance indices , of women with PE may affect timely attainment of therapeutic serum magnesium levels. Validation of its clinical impact requires further study focusing on women with severe PE.
