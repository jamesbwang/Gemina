  Lentiviral RNA genomes contain structural elements that play critical roles in viral replication. Although structural features of 5 '- untranslated regions have been well characterized , attempts to identify important structures in other genomic regions by Selective 2 '- Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension ( SHAPE) have led to conflicting structural and mechanistic conclusions. Previous approaches accounted neither for sequence heterogeneity that is ubiquitous in viral populations , nor for selective constraints operating at the protein level. We developed an approach that augments SHAPE with phylogenetic analyses and applied it to investigate structure in coding regions ( cRNA) within the HIV<pathogen> and SIV envelope genes. Analysis of single-genome SHAPE data with phylogenetic information from diverse lentiviral sequences argues against the conservation of a putative global
