  Several benefits of peer tutoring in medical school teaching have been described. However , there is a lack of research on the perceptions of peer tutoring , particularly from tutees who partake in a long-term clinical skills scheme integrated into the medical school curriculum. This study evaluates the opinions of preclinical tutees at the end of a 2-year peer-tutored clinical skills program and peer tutors themselves. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a UK-based medical school that primarily utilizes peer tutoring for clinical skills teaching. A questionnaire was designed to assess the views of preclinical tutees and peer tutors. Likert scales were used to grade responses and comment boxes to collect qualitative data. Sixty-five questionnaires were collected ( 52 tutees , 13 peer tutors). Seventy-nine percent of students felt satisfied with their teaching , and 70 % felt adequately prepared for clinical placements. Furthermore , 79 % believed that peer tutoring is the most effective method for clinical skills teaching. When compared to faculty teaching , tutees preferred being taught by peer tutors ( 63 %) , felt more confident ( 73 %) , and were more willing to engage ( 77 %). All peer tutors felt that teaching made them more confident in their Objective Structured Clinical Examination performance , and 91 % agreed that being a tutor made them consider pursuing teaching in the future. Thematic analysis of qualitative data identified 3 themes regarding peer tutoring: a more comfortable environment ( 69 %) , a more personalized teaching approach ( 34 %) , and variation in content taught ( 14 %). Preclinical tutees prefer being taught clinical skills by peer tutors compared to faculty , with the peer tutors also benefitting. Studies such as this , looking at long-term schemes , further validate peer tutoring and may encourage more medical schools to adopt this method as an effective way of clinical skills teaching.
