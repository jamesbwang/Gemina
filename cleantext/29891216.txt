  The mechanisms by which obesity increases the risk of psychosocial disorders remain unclear. We aimed at exploring the association between obesity and self-concept in Chinese youths and the role of adipokines. Data for 559 participants ( aged 14-28 years) were analyzed. Self-concept was assessed by utilizing the Self-Description Questionnaire II ( SDQ-II). Subjects with obesity had higher leptin , FGF21 and lower adiponectin levels ( all p < 0.001). They also had lower SDQ-II scores especially in the domains of general school , physical abilities , physical appearance and opposite-sex relations ( all p < 0.001). Both elevated FGF21 and leptin were correlated with lower scores in math ( p < 0.01) , physical abilities ( p < 0.01) , and opposite-sex relations ( p < 0.05) , meanwhile FGF21 negatively correlated with the scores in general school and honesty/trustworthiness , and leptin negatively correlated with physical appearance ( p < 0.01) but positively with verbal ( p < 0.01). In contrast , decreased adiponectin was correlated with poorer physical abilities ( p < 0.05) , physical appearance ( p < 0.05) , and parent relations ( p < 0.01). Moreover , these associations of leptin , FGF21 and adiponectin with certain domains remained significant after adjustment for BMI and other metabolic confounders. In conclusion , youths with obesity experienced poorly on self-concept , and these associations may be explained in part by adipokines leptin , FGF21 and adiponectin.
