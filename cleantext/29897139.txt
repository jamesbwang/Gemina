  Pathologic staging of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) can be challenging compared to other cancer types , as invasion often manifests as finger-like protrusions into vascular spaces or renal sinus tissue. Although prior studies have shown larger tumour size to be highly correlated with renal sinus invasion , prospective data on evaluating pathologic stage are limited. We evaluated a large series reported by a single urologic pathologist. Three hundred consecutive specimens were reviewed. Tumours larger than 5 cm were routinely extensively sampled or grossly re-reviewed when no extrarenal extension was identified on initial examination. Apparent multifocal disease was critically assessed for intravascular spread. Retrograde venous invasion was reported in 15/300 ( 5 %) cases , of which 13/15 were clear cell RCC. Of a total of 163 specimens with clear cell histology , only 5/34 ( 15 %) tumours 7 centimetres or larger were reported as pT2 , all of which had an explanatory comment indicating the absence of definitive extrarenal spread. In contrast , 15/20 ( 75 %) pT2 tumours were non-clear cell histology ( papillary , chromophobe , and translocation-associated). Comparing pT3a or higher tumours , the median tumour size in cases with retrograde venous invasion was 8.0 cm , compared to 6.2 cm in cases without ( p = 0.005). Our findings support that retrograde venous invasion should be carefully considered before diagnosing multifocal clear cell RCC , which is rare in the sporadic setting. In the absence of vascular invasion , multifocal clear cell papillary RCC can be a mimic. pT2 occurs more frequently with non-clear cell histology ( particularly papillary or chromophobe RCC).
