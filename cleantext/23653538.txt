  `` Building and breaking the cell wall '' is designed to review the bacterial cell envelope , previously learned in lower-division biology classes , while introducing new topics such as antibiotics and bacterial antibiotic resistance mechanisms. We developed a kinesthetic and tactile modeling activity where students act as cellular components and construct the cell wall. In the first two acts , students model a portion of the gram-positive bacterial cell envelope and then demonstrate in detail how the peptidoglycan is formed. Act III involves student demonstration of the addition of Î²-lactam antibiotics to the environment and how they inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan , thereby preventing bacterial replication. Using
