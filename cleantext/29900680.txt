  An estimated 30 % of patients accessing community weight management services experience symptoms of binge eating disorder ( BED). Guided self-help ( GSH) is the recommended first line of treatment for BED. This study is a preliminary investigation into the effectiveness of GSH delivered by dietitians for patients with binge eating within a weight management service and a consideration of the association between wellbeing , therapeutic relationship and outcomes. The study was conducted as a single group , pre- and post-intervention study with 24 patients reporting symptoms of binge eating who completed the self-help manual with guidance from a trained community dietitian. Primary outcomes were eating disorder psychopathology and behaviours ( Eating Disorder Evaluation Questionnaire) , depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom>. Principle results showed a significant reduction on all subscales of eating disorder psychopathology , anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> There was a reduction in loss of control over eating but the 40 % reduction in binge episodes was not statistically significant. Mid-treatment sessional ratings were positively associated with outcome. In conclusion , the GSH intervention was appropriate for dietitian delivery to patients with obesity and binge eating behaviour. This research indicates potential for other dietetic-led weight management services to deliver such interventions and support patients with binge eating accessing their service.
