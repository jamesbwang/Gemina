  Developing efficient catalytic materials for electrochemical water splitting is important. Herein , uniformly dispersed and size-controllable iridium ( Ir) nanoparticles ( NPs) were prepared using a nitrogen-functionalized carbon as the support ( Ir/CN). We found that nitrogen functionalization can simultaneously modulate the size of Ir NPs to substantially enhance the catalytically active sites and adjust the electronic structure of Ir , thereby promoting electrocatalytic activity for water splitting. Consequently , the as-synthesized Ir/CN shows excellent electrocatalytic performance with overpotentials of 12 and 265 mV for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in basic medium , respectively. These findings may pave the way for designing and synthesizing other similar materials as efficient catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.
