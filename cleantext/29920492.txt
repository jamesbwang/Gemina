  Hydatid disease is an endemic zoonotic disease in many areas of the world. An intracranial hydatid cyst<symptom> is a relatively rare entity , accounting for only 1-2 % of all intracranial space-occupying lesions<symptom>. Most commonly they are seen in children and young adults. Here , we present 9 cases of pediatric intracranial hydatid cyst<symptom> operated at Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences , Srinagar , India , between 2009 and 2015. The mean age of presentation was 11.5 years. The male to female ratio was 5: 4. In 7 cases , a history of contact with pet dogs was present. Seizure<symptom> was the most common finding , present in 7 cases. Seven patients had solitary cysts<symptom> and 2 had multiple cysts<symptom> on presentation. All patients were operated on , and recurrence was observed in 2 patients. The features of this rare disease are retrospectively analyzed in this presentation and the literature is reviewed.
