  Chronic kidney disease ( CKD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Hence , CKD patients are often in chronic psychological distress. The objective of the study was to describe factors associated with psychological distress of CKD patients attending National Nephrology Unit. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 382 CKD patients above 18 years of age applying systematic sampling. The data was collected using self-administered questionnaires to assess the psychological distress ( GHQ-12) , social support ( SSQ6) , coping strategies ( BRIEFCOPE) , pain ( 0 to 10 numeric pain rating scale) , and physical role limitation due to ill health ( SF36QOL). Sociodemographic and disease-related data were collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire and a data extraction sheet. Multiple logistic regression was applied for determining the associated factors. The results were expressed as adjusted odds ratio ( AOR) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI). Percentage of psychological distress was 55.2 % ( 95 % CI: 48.4 % to 62 %). Poor<symptom> social support ( AOR = 1.81 , 95 % CI: 1.14-2.88) , low satisfaction with the social support received ( AOR = 4.14 , 95 % CI: 1.59-10.78) , stages IV and V of CKD ( AOR = 2.67 , 95 % CI: 1.65-4.20) , presence of comorbidities ( AOR = 2.38 , 95 % CI: 1.21-4.67) , within one year of diagnosis ( AOR = 2.23 , 95 % CI: 1.36-3.67) , low monthly income ( AOR = 2.26 , CI: 1.26-4.06) , higher out-of-pocket expenditure per month ( AOR = 1.75 , 95 % CI: 1.75-1.99) , and being a female ( AOR = 2.95 , 95 % CI: 1.79-4.9) were significantly associated with psychological distress. More than half of the CKD patients were psychologically distressed. Factors such as financial and social support will be worth considering early because of their modifiability.
