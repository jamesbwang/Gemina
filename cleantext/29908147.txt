  The objective of this study is to test the feasibility of using serum neurofilament light chain ( NfL) as a disease biomarker in Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy ( CIPN) since this easy accessible biological test may have a large impact on clinical management and safety of cancer patients. We performed this preclinical study using a well-characterized rat model based on repeated administration of the cytostatic drug vincristine ( VCR , 0.2 mg/kg intravenously via the tail vein once/week for 4 times). Serial NfL serum concentration was measured using the in-house Simoa NfL assay and peripheral neuropathy onset was measured by sensory and motor<symptom> nerve conduction studies. Serum NfL measure in untreated and VCR-treated rats demonstrated a steady , and significant increase during the course of VCR administration , with a final 4-fold increase with respect to controls ( p < .001) when sign of axonopathy and loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers were clearly evident and verified by behavioral , neurophysiological and pathological examination. This simple monitoring approach based on serum NfL concentration measures may be easily translated to clinical practice and should be considered as a putative marker of CIPN severity in a typical oncology outpatient setting. Further studies are needed to validate its utility in cancer patients treated with different neurotoxic drugs.
