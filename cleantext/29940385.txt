  Surgical resection of parasellar meningiomas is a challenging operation that traditionally has been performed with a large pterional or orbitozygomatic craniotomy. In this study , we report patient outcomes and detail our surgical approach when resecting these tumors with a smaller , less invasive `` mini-pterional '' craniotomy. We performed a retrospective review on all patients undergoing a mini-pterional craniotomy for resection of parasellar meningiomas from 2012 to 2016. We describe the technical aspects of the mini-pterional craniotomy and provide the outcomes of patients who received an operation with this approach. Twenty-four patients were treated with a mini-pterional craniotomy for resection of parasellar meningiomas. Median tumor volume was 6.2 cm The mini-pterional craniotomy can be used to resect parasellar meningiomas with good results and a low complication profile. This approach provides an efficacious method of resecting these tumors without sacrificing Simpson grade or patient safety.
