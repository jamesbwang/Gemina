  In this article , we demonstrate an effective , cheap , and fast way to shape the nasal alar cartilage in patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate. This technique straightens the vomer and brings the philtrum , columella , premaxilla , and the maxillary frenum to the midsagittal plane , while the alveolar ridges are shaped and positioned. This reduces the lip and palatal cleft to zero even in a 4-week period.
