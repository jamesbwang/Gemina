  Bacillus<pathogen> is the most widely studied biocontrol agent and has been extensively used in the development of biopesticides and fungicides. In this study , a new cyclic lipopeptide was isolated from Bacillus<pathogen> amyloliquefaciens HAB-2 by column chromatography on silica gel and Sephadex LH-20 , and its structures was elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis. This compound is a bacillomycin d-like compound , named as bacillomycin DC. The activity of bacillomycin DC was evaluated against C.<pathogen> gloeosporioides<pathogen> Penz. The median inhibitory concentration of bacillomycin DC was 1.21 μg/mL. In addition , bacillomycin DC may have low toxicity to aquatic species as indicated by its 96h half maximum lethal concentration of 22.20 μg/mL to zebrafish ( Danio<pathogen> rerio<pathogen> Our current study further provides evidence that bacillomycin DC is a potent fungicide against C.<pathogen> gloeosporioides<pathogen> Penz.
