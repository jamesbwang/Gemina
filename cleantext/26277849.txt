  Trabecular Bone Score ( TBS) provides an indirect score of trabecular microarchitecture from lumbar spine ( LS) dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Increasing soft tissue thickness artifactually reduces TBS values; we evaluated the effect of a fictitious increase of soft tissue thickness on TBS and bone mineral density ( BMD) reproducibility on a phantom model. A Hologic spine phantom was scanned with a QDR-Discovery W Hologic densitometer. Fresh pork rind layers of 5 mm were used to simulate the in-vivo soft tissues. For each scan mode ( fast array ( FA) , array , high definition ( HD)) , 25 scans were consecutively performed without phantom repositioning , at 0 ( no layers) , 1 cm , 3 cm , and 6 cm of thickness. BMD and TBS reproducibility was calculated as the complement to 100 % of least significant change. Both BMD and TBS reproducibility slightly decreased with increasing soft tissue; this difference was statistically significant only for BMD using HD modality ( reproducibility decreased from 99.4 % at baseline to 98.4 % at 6-cm of thickness). TBS reproducibility was slightly lower compared to that of BMD , and ranged between 98.8 % ( array , 0 cm) and 97.4 % ( FA , 6 cm). Without taking into account manufacturer BMI optimization , we found a progressive decrease of TBS mean values with increasing soft tissue thickness. The highest TBS difference between baseline scan and 6 cm was -0.179 ( -14.27 %) using HD. Despite being slightly lower than that of BMD , TBS reproducibility was not affected up to 6 cm of increasing soft tissue thickness , and was even less influenced by fat than BMD reproducibility.
