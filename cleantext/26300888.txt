  As an oxidative stress sensor , transient receptor potential melastatin 2 ( TRPM2) channel is involved in many physiological and pathological processes including warmth sensing , ischemia injury , inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> and diabetes. Intracellular calcium is critical for TRPM2 channel activation and the IQ-like motif in the N-terminus has been shown to be important by mediating calmodulin binding. Sequence analysis predicted two potential EF-loops in the N-terminus of TRPM2. Site-directed mutagenesis combining with functional assay showed that substitution with alanine of several residues , most of which are conserved in the typical EF-loop , including D267 , D278 , D288 , and E298 dramatically reduced TRPM2 channel currents. By further changing the charges or side chain length of these conserved residues , our results indicate that the negative charge of D267 and the side chain length of D278 are critical for calcium-induced TRPM2 channel activation. G272I mutation also dramatically reduced the channel currents , suggesting that this site is critical for calcium-induced TRPM2 channel activation. Furthermore , D267A mutant dramatically reduced the currents induced by calcium alone compared with that by ADPR , indicating that D267 residue in D267-D278 motif is the most important site for calcium sensitivity of TRPM2. In addition , inside-out recordings showed that mutations at D267 , G272 , D278 , and E298 had no effect on single-channel conductance. Taken together , our data indicate that D267-D278 motif in the N-terminus as a novel EF-loop is critical for calcium-induced TRPM2 channel activation.
