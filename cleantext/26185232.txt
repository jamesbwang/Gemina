  We define a set of universal , irreducible and essential set of material conditions for achieving basic human wellbeing , along with indicators and quantitative thresholds , which can be operationalized for societies based on local customs and preferences. We draw support for this decent living standard ( DLS) from different accounts of basic justice , including the capability approach and basic needs. The DLS goes beyond existing multidimensional poverty indicators by comprehensively addressing living conditions and the means of social participation. The DLS offers a normative basis to develop minimum wage and reference budgets , and to assess the environmental impacts , such as climate change , of eradicating poverty.
