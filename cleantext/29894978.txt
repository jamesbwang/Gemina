  Crutch use is prescribed early in the rehabilitation process following total hip replacement ( THR) surgery to improve safety and promote return to active living. Purpose of this study was to understand mid-term effects of crutch length setup on quiet standing and walking two months post-op when crutch use was no longer required. Thirty patients were evaluated 2 months post-surgery when they had been walking without crutch for a month. The patients had previously been assigned randomly to elbow flexed ( EF) or elbow extended ( EE) crutch set-ups and evaluated 3 days post-surgery. Quiet standing stability was assessed with participants standing in a comfortable position with each foot on separated force platforms , facing forward for 10 s. In addition , participants walked on the laboratory path , instrumented with motion tracking system and force platforms. For the quiet standing trial , centre of pressure measure , acromial height and lower limbs load bearing symmetry were evaluated. For the walking trial , spatiotemporal and ground reaction force ( GRF) parameters were evaluated together with side symmetry indices. Results showed no significant differences in any standing trial variables between groups. For walking , GRF parameters and symmetry indices were similar for both groups. However , increased base of support width , reduced self-selected walking speed and stride length were found for the EF group. This study showed that crutch set-up influenced gait after patients started to walk unassisted. Patients that previously used crutch adjusted according to the EE setup , demonstrated a more efficient gait with higher self-selected speed and longer and narrower stride. Clinicians may use these results for a proper crutch height adjustment , which improves walking and , in turn , functional recovery in post THR patients.
