  As the use of filmless examination images , using various systems , has increased , and became common to perform KAKUTEI and save the images. In particular , the use of quality assurance system for images ( Kenzo system) has increased to ensure the efficient performance of confirmed image. However , there has been no report showing what kind of function should be used or how to write the specifications of such a function in introducing the Kenzo system. Therefore , this study conducted a survey to the in-charge medical staff of medical institutions to provide `` information included in the specifications when introducing medical systems ''. As a result , it is possible , through analyzing and clarifying the necessary functions of the Kenzo system , to apply it in medical institutions with various scales and workflows. The results indicate the person in charge was looking for functions , such as `` coordination of information and image processing , securing the consistency of the information , and clarifying responsibility using the records of confirmed persons ''. We showed examples of how to describe these in the specifications.
