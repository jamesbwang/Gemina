  UV-LEDs are considered as the most promising UV light sources , because it has the potential to replace conventional UV lamps in some water treatment applications in the foreseeable future. In this study , UV-LEDs at four wavelengths in the UV-C or near UV-C range ( i.e. , 257.7 , 268 , 282.3 , and 301.2 nm) were used to investigate the wavelength-dependency on chlorine photolysis and its subsequent radical formation. The fluence-based photodecay rates of hypochlorous acid ( HOCl) and hypochlorite ( OCl
