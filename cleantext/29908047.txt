  To examine the extent and intensity of the coexistence of overactive bladder ( OAB) symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse ( POP) and to evaluate the likelihood of OAB symptom improvement after surgical POP reconstruction over a period of 2 years. The effectiveness of the transvaginal , single-incision ` Elevate ' technique for anatomical cure of anterior/apical and posterior/apical vaginal prolapse has been previously reported in a prospective , multicentre study. This technique uses mesh arms attached to the sacrospinous ligaments to recreate apical ligamentous support. Using the same sample population as that used in the multicentre study ( n = 281) , we conducted the present sub-analysis focusing on estimating the extent of comorbidity between POP and OAB symptoms , as well as the effects of subsequent pelvic floor reconstruction on OAB symptoms over a long period. Assessments of POP and OAB symptom severity before and after surgery at 6 , 12 and 24 months were obtained using the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory ( PFDI) questionnaire. Preoperatively , 70 % of all POP patients reported moderate to severe OAB symptoms , with almost half ( 49.5 %) noting severe OAB bother ( ` quite a bit bothersome ') for one or more of the classic OAB symptom domains on the PFDI: ` daytime urinary frequency '; ` urinary urgency '; ` urinary urgency incontinence '; and/or ` nocturia '. In fact , across all four OAB symptom domains evaluated , there were significantly more severe<symptom> symptoms<symptom> ( ` quite a bit bothersome ') than moderate ( ` moderately bothersome ') or mild ( ` somewhat bothersome '): 26-31 % , 13-21 % , and 17-19 % of patients , respectively. In patients with symptomatic POP > stage 2 , there was no relationship between further degree of prolapse and presence of severity of OAB symptoms; however , patients with POP stage 2 had significantly more complaints regarding the items ` daytime urinary frequency ' and ` urinary urgency incontinence ' compared with those with stage 3-4 POP. Pelvic floor reconstructive surgery resulted in significant improvement in all OAB symptoms , which seemed to be stable over time. The cure rate of moderate-to-severe OAB complaints ranged between 60 % and 80 % , which was a durable improvement noted throughout 24 months. Results showed that POP was to a high degree accompanied by moderate-to-severe OAB complaints. Significant long-lasting improvements in bothersome OAB symptoms occurred after adequate surgical reconstruction of anterior/apical and posterior/apical vaginal support.
