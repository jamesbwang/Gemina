  It is known that physical exercise may increase platelet activity. However , the effect of exercise on platelet reactivity in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy has not been investigated yet. In our study , 21 patients with coronary artery disease on dual antiplatelet therapy and 10 controls were enrolled. We performed an exercise test using a cycle ergometer and determined the adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet reactivity before and immediately after exercise testing. Additionally , we analysed maximal exercise capacity and an electrocardiogram. Further , we assessed chromogranin A and P-selectin levels and platelet counts.
