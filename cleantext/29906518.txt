  The Dr. Probe software for multislice simulations of STEM images is introduced , and reference is given of the applied methods. Major program features available with the graphical user interface version are demonstrated by means of a few examples for bright-field and dark-field STEM imaging as well as simulations of diffraction patterns. The numerical procedure applied for the simulation of thermal-diffuse scattering by the frozen-lattice approach is described in detail. Intensity variations occurring in simulations with atomic-column resolution due to frozen-lattice variations are discussed in the context of atom counting. It is found that a significant averaging over many lattice configurations with different random atomic displacements is required to prevent atom-counting bias from simulations. A strategy is developed for the assessment of the amount of required averaging based on the estimated signal variance and the expected signal gain per atom in a column.
