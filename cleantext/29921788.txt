  Shot peening is a surface process commonly used in the aeronautic and automotive industries to improve fatigue<symptom> resistance. Shot peening is proven to be beneficial in the fatigue<symptom> behavior<symptom> of components , but rarely has its influence on wear and pitting corrosion resistance been evaluated. In this work , shot peening was performed on AISI F55-UNS S32760 super-duplex stainless steel samples previously submitted to various thermal treatments , to obtain different initial microstructures and properties. Samples have been characterized in terms of microstructure morphology , local chemical composition , microhardness of each constituent phase , and energy dissipation modes. The enhanced properties provided by shot peening has been evaluated through residual stress depth profiles and Full Width at Half Maximum ( FWHM) using X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , surface hardness , surface roughness , and corrosion resistance through salt spray fog tests. The 1400 & deg; C solution thermal treatment was identified as the optimum initial condition , which maximizes the advantages of the shot peening treatment , even pitting corrosion resistance. These results are related to the uniformity of austenite and ferrite in terms of microstructure morphology , micromechanical properties , and alloying elements distribution.
