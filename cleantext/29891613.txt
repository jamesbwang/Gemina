  The complex formation between the proteins Apoptosis Inducing Factor ( AIF) and Cyclophilin A ( CypA) following oxidative stress in neuronal cells has been suggested as a main target for reverting ischemia-stroke damage. Recently , a peptide encompassing AIF residues 370-394 has been developed to target the AIF-binding site on CypA , to prevent the association between the two proteins and suppress glutamate-induced cell death in neuronal cells. Using a combined approach based on NMR spectroscopy , synthesis and
