  As humans walk or run , external ( environmental) and internal ( physiological) disturbances induce variability. How humans regulate this variability from stride-to-stride can be critical to maintaining balance<symptom>. One can not infer what is `` controlled '' based on analyses of variability alone. Assessing control requires quantifying how deviations are corrected across consecutive movements. Here , we assessed walking and running , each at two speeds. We hypothesized differences in speed would drive changes in variability , while adopting different gaits<symptom> would drive changes in how people regulated stepping. Ten healthy adults walked/ran on a treadmill under four conditions: walk or run at comfortable speed , and walk or run at their predicted walk-to-run transition speed. Time series of relevant stride parameters were analyzed to quantify variability and stride-to-stride error-correction dynamics within a Goal-Equivalent Manifold ( GEM) framework. In all conditions , participants ' stride-to-stride control respected a constant-speed GEM strategy. At each consecutively faster speed , variability tangent to the GEM increased ( p ≤ 0.031) , while variability perpendicular to the GEM decreased ( p ≤ 0.044). There were no differences ( p ≥ 0.999) between gaits<symptom> at the transition speed. Differences in speed determined how stepping variability was structured , independent of gait , confirming our first hypothesis. For running versus walking , measures of GEM-relevant statistical persistence were significantly less ( p ≤ 0.004) , but showed minimal-to-no speed differences ( 0.069 ≤ p ≤ 0.718). When running , people corrected deviations both more quickly and more directly , each indicating tighter control. Thus , differences in gait determined how stride-to-stride fluctuations were regulated , independent of speed , confirming our second hypothesis.
