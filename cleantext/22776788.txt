  Multiple primary malignancies can occur in the same organ or in multiple organs or systems. Likewise , they can occur simultaneously or successively. Based on the timing of the diagnosis , they are classified as multiple synchronous ( i.e. , concurrent) or metachronous ( i.e. , successive) primary malignancies. The vast majority of patients have multiple metachronous malignant tumors; multiple synchronous tumors are rare. A 63-year-old woman presented with the chief complaint of vaginal fluid discharge for 3 months and abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> for 1 month. The patient was diagnosed with multiple synchronous primary malignancies: 1) endometrial poorly differentiated serous adenocarcinoma , stage IV; 2) poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix , stage IB1; and 3) left-sided fallopian tube carcinoma in situ. After total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , and comprehensive staging and debulking , the patient was administered eight courses of adjuvant chemotherapy ( taxane carboplatin/taxane cisplatin). After chemotherapy completion , the patient has been undergoing regular follow-up examinations; no recurrence has been noted at 18 months. It is important to distinguish between multiple synchronous primary malignancies and metastasis of a primary tumor to select the appropriate treatment regimen and to adequately assess the patient 's prognosis. When a cancer patient shows clinical manifestations of another tumor , not only metastasis but also the possibility of multiple synchronous primary malignant tumors should be considered. The duration of follow-up in patients with malignant tumors should be extended as much as possible , as the timely detection and treatment of other primary malignant tumors can prolong survival and improve the quality of life.
