  Intradiploic epidermoid cyst<symptom> ( IEC) concurrent with chronic epidural hematoma ( CEDH) has never been reported in the literature. We report a unique case of IEC concurrent with anatomically close associated CEDH. A 54-year-old man presented with one week history of headache<symptom> , confusion<symptom> and drowsiness<symptom>. Computed tomography ( CT) exposed large extraaxial mixed density lesions<symptom> with bone destruction and substantial mass effect in the left fronto-temporal region. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed two adjacent extraaxial lesions<symptom>. The frontal<symptom> lesion<symptom> was predominantly hyperintense on both T1-weighted image ( T1WI) and T2-weighted image ( T2WI) , with an enhancement rim of the thickened dura mater. While the fronto-temporal lesion<symptom> was mainly hyperintense on both TlWI and T2WI , with some areas of hypointensity on both TlWI and T2WI. No enhancement in the lesion<symptom> was found. The patient underwent left fronto-temporal craniotomy for resection of the lesion<symptom>. At the time of the craniotomy , a lot of yellow liquid outflowed. After the bone flap was removed , an irregular tumor was found epidurally located and composed of fragile and laminated yellow materials. The tumor was totally removed. Histological examination revealed an epidermoid cyst<symptom>. Postoperative CT showed mild<symptom> bleeding<symptom> on the operation area. His symptoms improved significantly after surgery and he was discharged 1 week later. At 2-weeks follow-up , the patient was well without neurological deﬁcits. Intradiploic epidermoid cyst<symptom> concurrent with chronic epidural hematoma is extremely rare. We present the ﬁrst case of intradiploic epidermoid cyst<symptom> concurrent with anatomically close associated chronic epidural hematoma.
