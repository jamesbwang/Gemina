  The brain is a remarkable network of circuits dedicated to sensory integration , perception , and response. The computational power of the brain is estimated to dwarf that of most modern supercomputers , but perhaps its most fascinating capability is to structurally refine itself in response to experience. In the language of computers , the brain is loaded with programs that encode when and how to alter its own hardware. This programmed `` plasticity '' is a critical mechanism by which the brain shapes behavior to adapt to changing environments. The expansive array of molecular commands that help execute this programming is beginning to emerge. Notably , several neuropeptide transmitters , previously best characterized for their roles in hypothalamic endocrine regulation , have increasingly been recognized for mediating activity-dependent refinement of local brain circuits. Here , we discuss recent discoveries that reveal how local signaling by corticotropin-releasing hormone reshapes mouse olfactory bulb circuits in response to activity and further explore how other local neuropeptide networks may function toward similar ends.
