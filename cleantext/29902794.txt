  The interplay between the immune system and behaviour is of increasing interest in psychiatry research. Specifically , accumulating data points to a link between inflammation<symptom> and psychopathology , including affective symptomatology. We investigated the association between inflammation<symptom> and affective polarity in psychiatric inpatients who were hospitalized due to an affective exacerbation. Data was collected retrospectively and comparisons were made between manic and depressed patients. C-reactive protein ( CRP) , a general laboratory marker of immune activation and inflammation<symptom> , was used as a non-specific inflammatory biomarker. Age , smoking and body mass index were considered covariates. Manic polarity ( n = 89) was associated with statistically significant elevated CRP levels compared to depressed polarity ( n = 44 , 56 %; p = 0.036) , after controlling for covariates. No differences were observed in CRP levels across Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV Edition-Text Revised psychiatric diagnoses. These findings suggest a transdiagnostic association between inflammation<symptom> and manic polarity in affective inpatients.
