  Intracranial primary collision tumors of different histologic types are rare. Until now , it is still unclear about the occurrence of collision tumors. We described a 66-year-old female who presented with headache<symptom> , nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom>. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scan showed that there were two primary intracranial tumors occurring simultaneously at adjacent sites of the right cerebral hemisphere. The pathology of tumors showed two distinct tumors: meningioma ( WHO I) and glioblastoma ( GBM). This is a rare case where two different intracranial primary tumors occur at adjacent sites but the patient had no history of head trauma , neurological surgery or radiation therapy. According to the previous and our present reports , the most common type of intracranial primary collision tumor is composed of a benign meningioma and a glioblastoma. During the occurrence of collision tumors , one tumor can play a role in the formation and growth of the other one.
