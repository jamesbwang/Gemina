  Alcohol addiction leads to increased choice of alcohol over healthy rewards. We established an exclusive choice procedure in which ~ 15 % of outbred rats chose alcohol over a high-value reward. These animals displayed addiction-like traits , including high motivation to obtain alcohol and pursuit of this drug despite adverse consequences. Expression of the Î³-aminobutyric acid ( GABA) transporter GAT-3 was selectively decreased within the amygdala of alcohol-choosing rats , whereas a knockdown of this transcript reversed choice preference of rats that originally chose a sweet solution over alcohol. GAT-3 expression was selectively decreased in the central amygdala of alcohol-dependent people compared to those who died of unrelated causes. Impaired GABA clearance within the amygdala contributes to alcohol addiction , appears to translate between species , and may offer targets for new pharmacotherapies for treating this disorder.
