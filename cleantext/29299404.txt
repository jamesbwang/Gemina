  African Americans ( AA) have the highest incidence and mortality rates with lung cancer. They are diagnosed at an earlier age with more advanced disease. Programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitor , Nivolumab , was approved as a second-line agent after failure of platinum-based therapy for advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). The original studies leading to the approval of Nivolumab had insufficient AA patients , thus there is still inadequate knowledge on treatment outcomes among AA patients. Our primary study endpoints were to determine the median overall survival , 1-year overall survival rate , median progression-free survival , and 1-year progression-free survival rate of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer on Nivolumab. Our secondary study endpoints were to determine the overall tumor response rate , median time to response , median duration of response , and incidence of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4. In this retrospective study , we reviewed the charts of 38 patients , 29 of which were AA , with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who received Nivolumab from March 1 , 2015 until November 30 , 2017 from a single community-based cancer center and compared our results with historical data. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histology ( 71 %) among all patients. Seven ( 18 %) continued to use Nivolumab while 21 ( 55 %) discontinued the treatment mainly due to progression of the disease. The median overall survival was 21.4 months ( 95 % CI 13.5-27.4) and 17.6 months ( 95 % CI 11.5-27.6) for all the patients and AA , respectively. Both have statistically significant difference ( P < 0.001) compared to the historical studies of Borghaei et al. and Brahmer et al.. At 1 year , the overall survival rate was 73 % ( 95 % CI 50-86) and 66 % ( 95 % CI 40-82) for all patients and AA , respectively. The median progression-free survival was also statistically significant ( P < 0.001) between all the patients 6.3 months ( 95 % CI 2.8-8) , AA 6.0 months ( 95 % CI 2.3-8.0) , and the said historical studies. The 1-year progression-free survival rate was 23 % ( 95 % CI 10-39) and 28 % ( 95 % CI 12-47) for all patients and AA , respectively. Overall tumor response rate which includes complete and partial responses was 21 % ( 95 % CI 10-37) and 24 % ( 95 % CI 10-43) for all patients and AA , respectively. The median time to response was 3 and 2.8 months for all patients and AA , respectively. The median duration of response was 3.8 and 4.0 months for all patients and AA , respectively. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 8 and 10 % in all patients and AA , respectively , similar to the rates previously shown. AA patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC on Nivolumab had increased overall survival and progression-free survival with similar grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events. Providing adequate access to immunotherapy is indispensable to maximize survival benefit for AA patients.
