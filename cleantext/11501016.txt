  Intervertebral disc degeneration is associated with angiogenesis and is the primary cause of disc-associated disease. Several studies have indicated the importance of microRNA ( miR) -21 in angiogenesis. Thus , the present study aimed to validate the role and underlying mechanisms of miR-21 in a rat model of intervertebral disc degeneration. A total of 60 specific-pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats were used for
