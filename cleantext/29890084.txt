  To compare keratometry and corneal astigmatism measurements obtained by the Verion Image Guided System to those obtained by automated keratometry ( IOLMaster) , manual keratometry ( YZ38 , Suzhou 66 visual Polytron Technologies Inc. , China) , and Scheimpflug imaging ( Pentacam HR) in eyes with cataract. A total of 149 cataractous eyes of 149 patients were examined and categorized as low astigmatism ( < 1.0 D , N = 50) , moderate astigmatism ( 1.0-2.0 D , N = 49) , and high astigmatism ( > 2.0 D , N = 50). The flattest and the steepest keratometric values ( Kf and Ks) , the magnitude of astigmatism ( Ast) , the orientation of the steepest meridian ( Axis) , and power vectors J Keratometry readings ( Kf , Ks , and Km) obtained by the Verion system showed statistically significant differences as compared to the other three devices. The magnitude of astigmatism ( Ast) measured by the Verion ( 1.50 ± 0.85 D) was similar to that measured by the YZ38 ( 1.45 ± 0.82 D , P = 0.110) and slightly lower than that by the IOLMaster ( 1.56 ± 0.87 D , P = 0.014) , but much higher than that by the Pentacam ( 1.36 ± 0.81 D , P = 0.000) significantly. However , no statistically significant differences were observed in the J Keratometric and astigmatic results obtained with Verion were not completely interchangeable with those obtained with IOLMaster , manual keratometry , and Pentacam. The individual differences in power and orientation of the corneal cylinder should be considered while selecting the appropriate toric intraocular lens.
