  Hollow bimetallic nanoparticles exhibit unique surface plasmonic properties , enhanced catalytic activities and high photo-thermal conversion efficiencies amongst other properties , however , their research and further deployment are currently limited by their complicated multi-step syntheses. This paper presents a novel approach for their continuous synthesis with controllable and tuneable sizes and compositions. This robust manufacturing tool , consisting of coiled flow inverter ( CFI) reactors connected in series , allows for the first time the temporal and spatial separation of the initial formation of silver seeds and their subsequent galvanic displacement reaction in the presence of a palladium precursor , leading to the full control of both steps separately. We have also demonstrated that coupling the galvanic replacement and co-reduction leads to a great kinetic enhancement of the system leading to a high yield process of hollow bimetallic nanoparticles , directly applicable to other metal combinations.
