  In this period of post-deinstitutionalization , much of the care for people with severe psychiatric disorders ( PD) is provided by their families. A primary stressor for caregivers is fears regarding their own safety and that of others , which has been virtually unexplored. To fill this gap , factors in three domains were assessed: ( 1) relatives with PD , ( 2) family caregivers , and ( 3) interactions with each other. This investigation was a secondary analysis of data obtained from a national survey of caregivers of adults with mental illness conducted by the National Alliance for Caregiving. A subsample of 1,505 was used in the present study. Fear of harm was positively associated with the following factors: relatives with PD-serious mental health problem , alcohol and substance abuse , receipt of crisis mental health treatment , history of arrest; interaction-greater difficulty getting relative to take medications as prescribed; and fear that relative would be hurt by others or die by suicide. Social workers need to be cognizant of risk of potential violence against caregivers and ensure the safety of these family members , even if they may not be their primary clients. The article includes recommendations for family inclusion in the treatment of people with PD.
