  Chemotherapeutic 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU) combined with oxaliplatin is often used as the standard treatment for colorectal cancer ( CRC). The disturbing side effects and drug resistance commonly observed in chemotherapy motivate us to develop alternative optimal therapeutic options for CRC treatment. Chrysin , a natural and biologically active flavonoid abundant in propolis , is reported to have antitumor effects on a few CRCs. However , whether and how chrysin achieves similar effectiveness to the 5-FU combination is not clear. In this study , 3- ( 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT) , western blotting , fluorescence microscopy , and reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production were assayed. We found that chrysin exhibited similar inhibition of cell viability as the 5-FU combination in a panel of human CRC cells. Furthermore , the results showed that chrysin significantly increased the levels of LC3-II , an autophagy-related marker , in CRC cells , which was not observed with the 5-FU combination. More importantly , blockage of autophagy induction restored chrysin-attenuated CRC cell viability. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that chrysin , not the 5-FU combination , induced ROS generation , and in turn , inhibited the phosphorylation of protein kinase B ( Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR). Collectively , these results imply that chrysin may be a potential replacement for the 5-FU and oxaliplatin combination to achieve antitumor activity through autophagy for CRC treatment in the future.
