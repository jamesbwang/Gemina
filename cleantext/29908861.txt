  In this paper , we have developed a label-free and rapid fluorescence assay for the detection of exonuclease III ( exo III) activity via thioflavin T ( ThT) as the G-quadruplex inducer. In this assay , a hairpin probe ( HP) with a 5 '- guanine-rich ( G-rich) sequence is employed as the substrate for exo III. In the presence of exo III , HP can be digested at 3 '- OH termini releasing 5 '- G-rich sequence. Then , the 5 '- G-rich sequence folds into a G-quadruplex , which can be recognized quickly by the ThT dye resulting in an increase in fluorescence emission. This strategy can detect exo III activity as low as 0.5 U/mL. This assay is simple and of low cost without the requirement of labeling with a fluorophore-quencher pair.
