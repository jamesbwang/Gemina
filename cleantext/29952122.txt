  This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of preclinical training on ceramic crown preparation using digital training system compared with traditional training method. A sample of 66 participating fourth-year undergraduate dental students were randomly assigned to one of two groups for ceramic crown preparation: experimental group as trained using digital method with Online Peer-Review System ( OPRS) and Real-time Dental Training and Evaluation System ( RDTES); control group as trained using traditional method with instructor demonstration and evaluation. At the completion of training periods , both groups performed the preparation of ceramic crown of upper left central incisor , which were blindly scored by the experienced instructors under the pre-defined assessment criteria. The results of both were compared using Student 's t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test. The level of significance was P < .05. The questionnaires regarding the benefits or drawbacks of digital training system were answered by the students of experimental group. Five of 15 items in the assessment outcome of the digital group were significantly better than the traditional group. The questionnaire results from the students of the experimental group indicated 96.97 % of the students agreed or strongly agreed that using digital training system could better improve the practical ability than traditional method. The total scores of practical results were significantly positively correlated with the points of the questionnaires. The digital training system with OPRS and RDTES might be a good alternative to the traditional training method in the preclinical course of dental practice.
