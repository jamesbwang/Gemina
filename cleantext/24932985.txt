  Stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes for the regeneration of articular cartilage is a promising strategy , but it is currently ineffective. Although both physical stimulation and growth factors play important roles in cartilage repair , their interplay remains unclear and requires further investigation. In this study , we aimed to clarify their contribution using a magnetic drug carrier that not only can deliver growth factors but also provide an external stimulation to cells in the two-dimensional environment. We developed a nanocapsule ( transforming growth factor-β1 ( TGF-β1)- loaded magnetic amphiphilic gelatin nanocapsules ( MAGNCs); TGF-β1 @MAGNCs) composed of hexanoic-anhydride-grafted gelatin and iron oxide nanoparticles to provide a combination treatment of TGF-β1 and magnetically induced physical stimuli. With the expression of Arg-Gly-Asp peptide in the gelatin , the TGF-β1 @MAGNCs have an inherent affinity for chondrogenic ATDC5 cells. In the absence of TGF-β1 , ATDC5 cells treated with a magnetic field show significantly upregulated Col2a1 expression. Moreover , TGF-β1 slowly released from biodegradable TGF-β1 @ MAGNCs further improves the differentiation with increased expression of Col2a1 and Aggrecan. Our study shows the time-dependent interplay of physical stimuli and growth factors on chondrogenic regeneration , and demonstrates the promising use of TGF-β1 @MAGNCs for articular cartilage repair.
