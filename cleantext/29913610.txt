  The landscape surrounding urban areas is often used as farmland. With the observed expansion of urban areas over the last decades and a projected continuation of this trend , our objective was to analyze how urbanization affects food supply and demand in The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. We used a chain of simulation models covering components of the atmosphere ( climate simulations) , biosphere ( crop yield calculations) , and anthroposphere ( simulations of urban expansion and land-use change) to calculate the effect of farmland displacement on land and water resources ( hydrosphere). Our simulations show that the displacement of farmland itself has hardly any effect on cropland demand , crop yields , or irrigation water requirements. These results indicate that Jordan has sufficient productive areas available to buffer effects of urban expansion on food production for the next decades. However , this picture changes dramatically once we include changes in socioeconomy and climate in our simulations. The isolated effect of climate change results in an expected increase in irrigation water requirements of 19 MCM by 2025 and 64 MCM by 2050. It furthermore leads to an increase in cropland area of 147 km
