  Paraneoplastic neurological<disease> syndromes<disease> are rare conditions where an autoimmune reaction against the nervous system appears in patients suffering from a tumour , but not linked to the spreading of the tumour. A break in the immune tolerance is thought to be the trigger. The transcriptomic profile of 12 ovarian tumours ( OT) from patients suffering from paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration ( PCD) linked to anti-Yo antibodies ( anti-Yo PCD OT) was compared with 733 ovarian tumours ( OT control) from different public databases using linear model analysis. A prominent significant transcriptomic over-representation of CD8 + and Treg cells was found in anti-Yo PCD OT , as compared to the OT control. However , the overall degree of immune cell infiltration was similar , according to the ESTIMATE immune score. We also found an under-representation of M2 macrophages in anti-Yo PCD OT. Furthermore , the differentially expressed genes were enriched for AIRE-related genes , a well-known transcription factor associated with a broad range of autoimmune diseases. Finally , we found that the differentially expressed genes were correlated to the transcriptomic profiling of the cerebellar structures. Our data pinpointed the enrichment of acquired immune response , particularly high density of CD8 + lymphocytes , and high-level expression of CDR-related antigens in anti-Yo PCD OT.
