  Hyperpolarization techniques are key to extending the capabilities of MRI for the investigation of structural , functional and metabolic processes in vivo. Recent heterogeneous catalyst development has produced high polarization in water using parahydrogen with biologically relevant contrast agents. A heterogeneous ligand-stabilized Rh catalyst is introduced that is capable of achieving
