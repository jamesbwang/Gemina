  The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor ( GLP-1R) agonist liraglutide is an incretin hormone mimetic used in the treatment of diabetes. However , the effects of liraglutide on pulmonary hypertension ( PH) and pulmonary endothelin ( ET) system are unknown. Eight-week-old C57BL6/J mice were injected liraglutide or vehicle for 5 weeks. One week after injection , the mice were exposed to either room air ( normoxia) or chronic hypoxia ( 10 % O ( 2)) for 4 weeks. The right ventricular systolic pressure ( RVSP) was significantly higher in hypoxia + vehicle group than in normoxia + vehicle group. ET-1 mRNA expression in the lungs was comparable among all the groups. ET ( B) mRNA and protein expression in the lungs was significantly lower in hypoxia + vehicle group than in normoxia + vehicle group. The above changes were normalized by liraglutide treatment. The expression of phospho-eNOS and phospho-AMPK proteins in the lungs was significantly higher in hypoxia + liraglutide group than in normoxia + vehicle group. We demonstrated for the first time that liraglutide effectively improved RVSP and RV hypertrophy in hypoxia-induced PH mice by activating eNOS through normalization of impaired ET ( B) pathway and augmentation of AMPK pathway. Therefore , GLP-1R agonists can be promising therapeutic agents for PH.
