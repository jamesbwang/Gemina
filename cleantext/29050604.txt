  Over the years the body of work relating chitosan and its possible skin-related applications has grown , showing that chitosan is active both as a free compound and as a functional finishing of textiles. As a free molecule chitosan proved itself to be an attractive option as it is biocompatible and has a demonstrated biological activity ( e.g. growth inhibition or adhesion inhibition) upon multiple skin pathogens , even upon multidrug resistant species. Furthermore , chitosan has wound healing accelerating properties , which make it a prime candidate for possible control of skin related infections. Almost inconspicuously , textiles have been one the main lines of defense of the skin against foreign threats , acting as a physical barrier to microbial colonization and infection. With the advent of textile functionalization specially designed textiles with enhanced protective characteristics , such as antimicrobial capacity , have come to the forefront. Chitosan functionalized textiles have been shown to be effective inhibitors of microbial growth with even invasive multidrug resistant species , as MRSA , being inhibited. Therefore , chitosan and chitosan functionalized textiles present themselves as both an interesting alternative to traditional antibiotics and as a possible means to enhance current treatment strategies.
