  Ongoing changes in arousal influence sensory processing and behavioral performance. Yet the circuit-level correlates for this influence remain poorly understood. Here , we investigate how functional interaction between posterior parietal cortex ( PPC) and lateral posterior ( LP)/ Pulvinar is influenced by ongoing fluctuations in pupil-linked arousal , which is a non-invasive measure of neuromodulatory tone in the brain. We find that fluctuations in pupil-linked arousal correlate with changes to PPC to LP/Pulvinar oscillatory interaction , with cortical alpha oscillations driving activity during low arousal states , and LP/Pulvinar driving PPC in the theta frequency band during higher arousal states. Active visual exploration by saccadic eye movements<symptom> elicits similar transitions in thalamo-cortical interaction. Furthermore , the presentation of naturalistic video stimuli induces thalamo-cortical network states closely resembling epochs of high arousal in the absence of visual input. Thus , neuromodulators may play a role in dynamically sculpting the patterns of thalamo-cortical functional interaction that underlie visual processing.
