  Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury ( SAKI) is a major complication of kidney disease associated with increased mortality and faster progression. Therefore , the development of imaging biomarkers to detect septic AKI is of great clinical interest. In this study , we aimed to characterize the endogenous chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CEST) MRI contrast in the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced SAKI mouse model and to investigate the use of CEST MRI for detecting such injury. We used a SAKI mouse model that was generated by i.p. injection of 10 mg/kg LPS. The resulting kidney injury was confirmed by the elevation of serum creatinine and histology. MRI assessments were performed 24 h after LPS injection , including CEST MRI at different B
