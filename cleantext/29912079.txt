J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-This study aimed to investigate the impact of physical performance components and anthropometric characteristics on serve velocity ( SV) in elite junior tennis players depending on the sex and age group. A sample of the best 1,019 ( male = 625 , female = 394) junior squad tennis players of the German Tennis Federation participated in the study involving complex anthropometric measurements ( body height , body mass , sitting height , and arm span) and physical tests ( e.g. , SV , medicine ball throws ( MBTs) , hand grip strength , push-ups , back extension , countermovement jumps ( CMJs) , horizontal jumps , 20-m sprint , and tennis-specific endurance). Of all the anthropometric and physical characteristics analyzed , the MBTs ( r = 0.49-0.60 ♂; r = 0.20-0.60 ♀) , hand grip strength ( r = 0.43-0.59 ♂; r = 0.27-0.37 ♀) , arm span ( r = 0.37-0.56 ♂; r = 0.24-0.36 ♀) , body height ( r = 0.31-0.52 ♂; r = 0.26-0.38 ♀) , and body mass ( r = 0.44-0.57 ♂; r = 0.35-0.39 ♀) were particularly closely correlated with SV. The results of the multiple regression analysis indicated that the combination of selected predictors ( e.g. , MBTs , grip strength , arm span , and body mass) explained 41-66 % of the variance in SV of boys and 19-45 % , respectively , for girls. The results reinforce that service speed is dependent on physical abilities and anthropometric characteristics but also strongly on additional factors ( i.e. , technical components). In particular , the upper-body power/strength highlight is important to the junior players ' service , especially in athletes with a greater body height and arm span ( i.e. , biomechanical advantages) , whereas purely lower-body power ( e.g. , CMJ) is less important. To this effect , talent identification and intervention programs focusing on the specific requirements are recommended.
