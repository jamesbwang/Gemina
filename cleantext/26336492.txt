  The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify the impact of oral anticoagulants on epistaxis<symptom> with the focus on new oral anticoagulants. The study was conducted at the Department for Ear- Nose- and Throat<symptom> ( ENT) , Head and Neck Surgery , Technical University Munich , Germany. All patients presenting in 2014 with the diagnosis of epistaxis<symptom> to a specialized ENT accident and emergency department were identified and analyzed in clinical data and medication. 600 adult cases , with a median age of 66.6 years were identified with active bleeding. 66.8 % of all cases were anticoagulated. Classic oral anticoagulants ( COAC) were three times more common in patients than new-generation oral anticoagulants ( NOAC). Recurrent bleeding was significantly associated with oral anticoagulants ( OAC) ( p = 0.014) and bleeding location was most often anterior ( p = 0.006). In contrast , severe cases , which required surgery or embolization were significantly more likely in non-anticoagulated middle-aged patients with posterior bleedings<symptom> ( p < 0.05). In our epistaxis<symptom> cohort , OAC were highly overrepresented ( 40 %) when compared to the general German population ( 1 %) but COAC as well as NOAC played only a minor role in severe courses of epistaxis<symptom>. Oral anticoagulation , especially with new-generation drugs , is not associated with more complicated and severe courses of epistaxis<symptom> , but rather with recurrent bleeding. One should keep this information in mind when triaging the patient in the emergency room and when planning further procedures.
