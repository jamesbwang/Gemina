  To examine correlations of inner nuclear layer ( INL) thickness with metamorphosia and tangential retinal displacement in epiretinal membrane ( ERM). Retrospective , consecutive , interventional case series. Setting: Institutional study. Fifty eyes of 50 patients undergoing epiretinal membrane surgery. M-CHARTS were used to measure metamorphopsia. Inner nuclear layer ( INL) thickness and outer retinal layer ( ORL) thickness in the macula and distances between the intersections of 2 sets of retinal vessels situated vertically or horizontally were measured in Spectralis optical coherence tomography and infrared images. Correlations of INL and ORL thicknesses with M-CHARTS scores and distances of retinal displacement. Preoperative INL thickness significantly correlated with preoperative and postoperative metamorphopsia scores at 3 months ( Spearman correlation coefficient: P = .036 and P = .003 , respectively). The baseline INL thickness and its change at 3 months significantly correlated with the postoperative vertical retinal displacements at 3 months ( P < .001 for both). Preoperative and postoperative ORL thicknesses were not correlated with preoperative and postoperative metamorphopsia scores at any periods. INL thickness is a useful biomarker to evaluate metamorphopsia and appears to be determined by tangential retinal displacement in ERM. Structural changes of the inner retinal layer , which cause Müller cells to be distorted , play a more important role for generation of metamorphosia than outer retina. Our results provide evidence for the theory that Müller cell functions as an optic fiber in humans.
