  In recognition of the central importance of surveillance and epidemiology in the control of antimicrobial resistance and the need to strengthen surveillance at all levels , Wellcome has brought together a new international expert group SEDRIC -LRB- Surveillance and Epidemiology of Drug Resistant Infections Consortium). SEDRIC aims to advance and transform the ways of tracking , sharing and analysing rates of infection and drug resistance , burden of disease , information on antibiotic use , opportunities for preventative measures such as vaccines , and contamination of the environment. SEDRIC will strengthen the availability of information needed to monitor and track risks , including an evaluation of access to , and utility of data generated by pharma and research activities , and will support the translation of surveillance data into interventions , changes in policy and more effective practices. Ways of working will include the provision of independent scientific analysis , advocacy and expert advice to groups , such as the Wellcome Drug Resistant Infection Priority Programme. A priority for SEDRIC 's first Working Group is to review mechanisms to strengthen the generation , collection , collation and dissemination of high quality data , together with the need for creativity in the use of existing data and proxy measures , and linking to existing in-country networking infrastructure. SEDRIC will also promote the translation of technological innovations into public health solutions.
