  This paper proposes a cooperative medium access control ( MAC) protocol for underwater wireless sensor networks ( UWSNs) named UCMAC , which fundamentally benefits from cooperative communication. In UCMAC , a source identifies cooperators and provides its destination with a list of the cooperators while also delineating their proximity to the destination. For erroneous reception of data packets , the destination then requests retransmission to the cooperators in a closest-one-first manner. A designated cooperator transmits the buffered data packet it has successfully overheard from the source or other cooperators. A signaling procedure and the various waiting times of the nodes are carefully designed to address the overheads that stem from cooperation. Through computer simulation , this paper evaluates UCMAC in terms of system throughput , latency , single-hop packet delivery ratio ( PDR) , and energy efficiency. The results show that UCMAC performs better than existing schemes , including MACA-U and CD-MACA.
