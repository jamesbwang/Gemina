  To retrospectively evaluate the clinical , pathological , and imaging features of ovarian serous surface papillary borderline tumors ( SSPBTs). Imaging features were analyzed , including the tumor size , laterality , tumor spread and the presence of ascites. Morphological nature ( encased normal ovary , characteristics on MRI) and contrast enhancement ( increased flow on Doppler ultrasound) were also evaluated. Clinical and pathological features , such as tumor markers ( CA 125) , treatment methods , outcomes on follow-up , and surgical staging , were analyzed. 10 tumors in 5 patients were evaluated. Mean largest tumor diameter was 45 mm. All patients had bilateral involvement and ascites. 40 % of all patients showed peritoneal implants. 20 % of patients evaluated had lymph node metastasis. These patients showed grossly normal ovaries that were encased in or surrounded by irregular solid tumors. They had a mostly hyperintense papillary architecture with hypointense internal branching on T SSPBT of the ovary , which has a good prognosis , should be considered as a diagnosis for patients who have bilateral enhancing irregular solid masses with papillary architecture and internal branching , and encasing normal-appearing ovaries. Advances in knowledge: Serous surface papillary borderline tumor of the ovary is unique and has characteristic features. Knowledge of this specific ovarian tumor and radiological suspicion can have important implications for the patient to facilitate management including fertility-preserving surgery.
