  Chronic constipation<symptom> is a very common medical problem with relevant impact on the patients ' quality of life. Modern definitions recognize constipation<symptom> as a polysymptomatic disorder , including various aspects of disturbed defecation. Current guidelines recommend a stepwise approach in the management of chronic constipation<symptom>. Isolated or concomitant evacuation disorders should be identified and may need differential/additional treatment. Baseline measures include lifestyle components and bulking agents. The next step recommends treatment with conventional laxatives. In refractory patients , modern medical therapies , such as the prokinetic prucalopride or the secretagogues linalotide or lubiprostone , may be used effectively. For patients with opioid-induced constipation<symptom> , the modern concept of peripherally acting Âµ-opioid antagonists has shown to successfully improve this increasing medical problem and even to potentially increase survival time in terminally ill patients on opioid therapy. Prolonged-released oral naloxone ( in fixed combination with oxycodone) , oral naloxegol or naldemedine , and subcutaneous methylnaltrexone have all demonstrated good efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of opioid-induced constipation<symptom>. To adequately apply stepwise treatment algorithms , a simple tool to identify treatment failure may improve patient care.
