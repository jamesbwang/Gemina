  Jules Joseph Dejerine ( 1849-1917) became renowned for his many contributions to neurology , including his anatomical and anatomo-functional studies , particularly those in the field of language and the peripheral nervous system. A disciple of Vulpian and a rival of Charcot , Dejerine progressed rapidly in the academic world , reaching the peak of his career in 1911 , when he was appointed to the chair of Nervous System Diseases at the Salpêtrière Hospital after defeating Pierre Marie ( 1853-1940) , one of the most distinguished pupils of Jean-Martin Charcot ( 1825-1893).
