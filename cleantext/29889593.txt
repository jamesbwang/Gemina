  High arsenic groundwater contamination causes serious health risks in many developing countries , particularly in India and Bangladesh. The arsenic fluxes in aquifers are primarily controlled by bacterial populations through biogeochemical cycle. In this present study , two gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria were isolated from shallow aquifers of Bhojpur district in Bihar during the early winter season , able to withstand arsenite ( As
