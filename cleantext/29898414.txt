  Bilirubin ( BR) is generated by the reduction of biliverdin ( BV) , a metabolite that results from the catalytic degradation of heme by the isoforms of heme oxygenase ( HO). BV is nontoxic and water-soluble but BR is potentially toxic and lipophilic. Therefore , a further metabolic step is required for BR before excretion is possible. The reductive conversion of BV to BR costs energy and is evolutionarily conserved in human physiology. There must be a compelling reason for this apparently nonsensical evolutionary conservation. In addition to the differences between BR and BV-such as water solubility , antioxidant activity , and participation as a receptor ligand-in the present study , we focused on the chemistry of the two metabolites with regard to an electrophilic functional group called a Michael reaction acceptor ( MRA). Our data reveal that the BR reacts with thiol compounds forming adducts , whereas no reaction occurs with BV. Furthermore , the binding of biotin-tagged BR to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 ( KEAP1)- a biological electrophile sensor-was prevented by pretreatment with BR or a thiol compound , but was not by pretreatment with BV. In cells , BR could bind to KEAP1 to release and activate nuclear factor-erythroid 2 ( NF-E2) p45-related factor 2 , a cytoprotective transcription factor , leading to the induction of HO-1. These findings may provide a physiological rationale for the energy-consuming conversion of BV to BR.
