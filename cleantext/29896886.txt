  Apoptotic mechanisms are often dysregulated in cancerous phenotypes. Additionally , many anticancer treatments induce apoptosis and necrosis<symptom> , and the monitoring of this apoptotic activity can allow researchers to identify therapeutic efficiency. Here we introduce a microscope which combines quantitative phase imaging with the ability to detect molecular events via FRET. The system was applied to study cells undergoing apoptosis to correlate the onset of apoptotic enzyme activity as observed using a FRET based apoptosis sensor with whole cell morphological changes analyzed via QPI. The QPI data showed changes in cell disorder strength during the initiation of apoptotic enzymatic activity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
