  A thermostable uronate dehydrogenase Tb-UDH from Thermobispora bispora was over-expressed in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> using the T7 polymerase expression system. The Tb-UDH was purified by metal affinity chromatography , and gave a single band on SDS-PAGE. The maximum activity on glucuronic acid was found at 60 °C and pH 7.0. The purified enzyme retained over 58 % of its activity after holding a pH ranging from 7.0 to 7.5 for 1 h at 60 °C. The K
