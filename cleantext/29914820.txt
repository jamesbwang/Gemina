  Outpatient hip arthroplasty is being performed more routinely; however , safety remains a concern. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate of adverse events of outpatient total hip arthroplasty ( THA) and assess barriers to discharge. We examined 136 patients who underwent unilateral THA by one surgeon and were discharged on the same day of surgery. Using propensity matching , 136 inpatients who received the same procedure , and were discharged on postoperative day one or later , were identified. For each cohort , 90-day occurrence of adverse events , readmissions , and emergency visits were recorded and compared. Adverse events were graded using the OrthoSAVES tool. A secondary objective was to assess potential barriers to same-day discharge. Within 90 days postoperatively , 12 outpatients ( 8.82 %) and 14 inpatients ( 10.29 %) developed an adverse event. There were no significant differences between the rate or severity of adverse events between the 2 groups and no serious adverse events in either group. In the outpatient group , there was a correlation between the dosage of spinal anesthetic ( bupivacaine) given and time required to stay in postanesthetic care unit postoperatively. When comparing the 2 groups , there were no differences in adverse events at 90 days. At our center , in the appropriate patient population , outpatient THA is a safe and cost-effective option. A potential barrier to mobility postoperatively and successful same-day discharge is the time required to stay in postanesthetic care unit postoperatively , which was significantly correlated with an increased dose of spinal anesthetic given in our outpatient cohort.
