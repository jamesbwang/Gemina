  When relating glycaemic index ( GI) and glycaemic load ( GL) to health outcomes , many prospective cohort studies assess the nutritional exposure only once in time , that is , at the start of the study , presuming a stability in nutritional consumption during the course of the study. The aim of this study is to investigate the reproducibility of GI and GL. This is a prospective cohort study in which 562 middle-aged Belgian adults noted all foods and drinks consumed during 3 d in 2002 and 2012. GI and GL were calculated after reference tables. The Pearson correlation coefficients between 2002 and 2012 were 0 · 27 for GI and 0 · 41 for GL. For GI , 33 % of the participants remained in the same quintile between 2002 and 2012 , whereas 31 % moved to a non-adjacent quintile. For GL , this was 34 and 28 % , respectively. The lowest and the highest quintiles of GI were the most stable , with 40 and 44 % of the participants staying in the same quintile. This was only 22 % for the fourth quintile. The same tendency was present for GL- that is , the most extreme quintiles were the most stable. This study shows 10-year correlation coefficients for GI and GL below 0 · 50. Multiple nutritional assessments and limiting the analysis to the extreme quintiles of GI and GL will limit a possible misclassification in the prospective cohort studies owing to the low reproducibility.
