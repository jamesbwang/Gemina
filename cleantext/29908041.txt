  Changes in microvascular perfusion have been reported in many diseases , yet the functional significance of altered perfusion is often difficult to determine. This is partly because commonly used techniques for perfusion measurement often rely on either indirect or by-hand approaches. We developed and validated a fully automated software technique to measure microvascular perfusion in videos acquired by fluorescence microscopy in the mouse gastrocnemius. Acute perfusion responses were recorded following intravenous injections with phenylephrine , SNP , or saline. Software-measured capillary flow velocity closely correlated with by-hand measured flow velocity ( R These results demonstrate a novel and sensitive technique for reproducible , user-independent quantification of microvascular perfusion.
