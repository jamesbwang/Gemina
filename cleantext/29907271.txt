  Closed loop control of mechanical ventilation is routine and operates behind the ventilator interface. Reducing caregiver interactions is neither an advantage for the patient or the staff. Automated systems causing lack of situational awareness of the intensive care unit are a concern. Along with autonomous systems must come monitoring and displays that display patients ' current condition and response to therapy. Alert notifications for sudden escalation of therapy are required to ensure patient safety. Automated ventilation is useful in remote settings in the absence of experts. Whether automated ventilation will be accepted in large academic medical centers remains to be seen.
