  We investigate the formation of zeolite structures in replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations of a reactive model of silica polymerization. The simulations incorporate hard spheres to model the effect of excluded volume caused by structure-directing agents ( SDAs). We focus on modeling the formation of cage-type zeolite frameworks SOD and LTA. Our model predicts that a relatively wide range of SDA sizes could be used to construct SOD , whereas a narrower range will work for constructing LTA. We also predict that there is potential benefit of including multiple SDAs in each zeolite unit cell , and in the case of LTA with both small and large cavities , there is a strong potential benefit using both small and large SDAs that match the cavities ' sizes. We hypothesize that the volume exclusion reduces the configuration space available to the assembling silica units , making it easier for the system to find ordered structures with quasi-spherical cavities.
