  Subdiffusive reflectance captured at short source-detector separations provides increased sensitivity to the scattering phase function and hence allows superficial probing of the tissue ultrastructure. Consequently , estimation of subdiffusive optical parameters has been the subject of many recent studies focusing on lookup-table-based ( LUT) inverse models. Since an adequate description of the subdiffusive reflectance requires additional scattering phase function related optical parameters , the LUT inverse models , which grow exponentially with the number of estimated parameters , become excessively large and computationally inefficient. Herein , we propose , to the best of our knowledge , the first artificial-neural-network-based inverse Monte Carlo model that overcomes the limitations of the LUT inverse models and thus allows efficient real-time estimation of optical parameters from subdiffusive spatially resolved reflectance. The proposed inverse model retains the accuracy , is about four orders of magnitude faster than the LUT inverse models , grows only linearly with the number of estimated optical parameters , and can be easily extended to estimate additional optical parameters.
