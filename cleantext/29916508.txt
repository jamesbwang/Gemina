  The synthesis and crystal structure of a novel metal organic framework , constructed from MnIII , the 4,4 '- bipyrazolate ( BPZ) ligand and bridging hydroxyl groups is presented in this work. The network topology is identical to M-CFA-6 ( M = Fe , Ga) , but in the case of Mn-CFA-6 , the structure crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system due to the Jahn-Teller effect of the high spin d4 manganese ( iii) centers. Thermal treatment of Mn-CFA-6 leads to decomposition of the framework above 150 °C. The porosity of Mn-CFA-6 was measured by carbon dioxide sorption , since solvent exchange and removal of the occluded solvent molecules leads to a compression of the pores. Electronic spectra of Mn-CFA-6 reveal two distinct absorption bands that are assigned to the two different manganese ( iii) centers as revealed by the single crystal structure analysis. Furthermore , SQUID measurements exhibit ferromagnetic behaviour of Mn-CFA-6 below the magnetic ordering at 45 K and antiferromagnetic coupling above this temperature. Evaluation of the paramagnetic region by the Curie-Weiß formula reveals an effective moment of 4.8 μB , which is very close to the spin-only value of MnIII centers.
