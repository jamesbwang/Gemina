  F18-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG)- positron emission tomography ( PET) along with computed tomography ( CT) is a standard method for assessing brown adipose tissue ( BAT) activity. We tested the usefulness of near-infrared time-resolved spectroscopy ( NIRTRS) as a simple and noninvasive method for evaluating BAT density ( BAT-d) by examining the effects of some factors known to influence BAT activity. The total hemoglobin concentration as a parameter of BAT-d was evaluated using NIRTRS in the supraclavicular region in 413 Japanese individuals. The associations were analyzed between BAT-d and sex , age , the percentages of body fat () , visceral fat ( VF) , and the seasonal ambient temperature ( AmT) fluctuations. Age was associated with decreased BAT-d ( P < 0.05). There was no sex difference in the BAT-d , except for those in their twenties. Multivariate analyses revealed that and VF were correlated with BAT-d , and the lower AmT ( around 4 째C or 5 째C) for 4 and 6 weeks prior to the measurement day was associated with an increase in the BAT-d. Our NIRTRS results were analogous to those reported with FDG18-PET/ CT , indicating the usefulness of NIRTRS. BAT-d might increase during the 4 and 6 weeks after the AmT decreases to lower than 4 째C or 5 째C.
