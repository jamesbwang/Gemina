  Equalizing limb length is of paramount importance for optimal outcome in patients undergoing hip arthroplasty ( HA). Numerous techniques have been described for avoiding limb length discrepancy ( LLD) in patients undergoing HA. However their applicability in patients undergoing HA for neck of femur ( NOF) fractures remains questionable due to dissociation between the femur and the head. I hereby describe a novel yet simple technique for better utilization of already established techniques to avoid LLD in NOF fractures undergoing HA. After exposure of hip , the proximal head and neck fragment is extracted taking care not to damage bone at fracture site. Proximal fragment is provisionally fixed to distal fragment in a retrograde manner using 6.5 mm cannulated screws after predrilling over guide wires. Horizontal and vertical offsets are measured. The hip<symptom> joint is reduced and a mark is made on greater trochanter ( GT) utilizing the co-axial stitch method. The joint is dislocated & screws removed.THR is done in a routine manner taking care to establish and recreate native anatomy of hip. Limb length is ascertained utilizing the previous mark on GT. Recreation of proximal femoral anatomy helps in better utilization of already established techniques to avoid LLD and helps us to re-create the native anatomy in HA. It is simple , less time consuming and does n't require extensive armamentarium or image guidance for its applicability. However it needs to be validated and its advantages might be undermined in old NOF fractures with resorption of the neck or in severely communited fractures.
