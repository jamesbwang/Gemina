  Falls are a major cause of morbidity among older people. Multifaceted interventions may be effective in preventing falls and related fractures. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness alongside the REducing Falls with Orthoses and a Multifaceted podiatry intervention ( REFORM) trial. REFORM was a pragmatic multicentre cohort randomised controlled trial in England and Ireland; 1,010 participants ( > 65 years) were randomised to receive either a podiatry intervention ( n = 493) , including foot and ankle strengthening exercises , foot orthoses , new footwear if required , and a falls prevention leaflet , or usual podiatry treatment plus a falls prevention leaflet ( n = 517). incidence of falls per participant in the 12 months following randomisation. proportion of fallers and quality of life ( EQ-5D-3L) which was converted into quality-adjusted life years ( QALYs) for each participant. Differences in mean costs and QALYs at 12 months were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention relative to usual care. Cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted in accordance with National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence reference case standards , using a regression-based approach with costs expressed in GBP ( 2015 price). The base case analysis used an intention-to-treat approach on the imputed data set using multiple imputation. There was a small , non-statistically significant reduction in the incidence rate of falls in the intervention group ( adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.88 , 95 % CI 0.73-1.05 , p = 0.16). Participants allocated to the intervention group accumulated on average marginally higher QALYs than the usual care participants ( mean difference 0.0129 , 95 % CI -0.0050 to 0.0314). The intervention costs were on average GBP 252 more per participant compared to the usual care participants ( 95 % CI GBP -69 to GBP 589). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged between GBP 19,494 and GBP 20,593 per QALY gained , below the conventional National Health Service cost-effectiveness thresholds of GBP 20,000 to GBP 30,000 per additional QALY. The probability that the podiatry intervention is cost-effective at a threshold of GBP 30,000 per QALY gained was 0.65. The results were robust to sensitivity analyses. The benefits of the intervention justified the moderate cost. The intervention could be a cost-effective option for falls prevention when compared with usual care in the UK.
