  Primary hyperoxalurias ( PHs) are autosomal recessive disorders caused by the overproduction of oxalate leading to calcium oxalate precipitation in the kidney and eventually to end-stage renal disease. One promising strategy to treat PHs is to reduce the hepatic production of oxalate through substrate reduction therapy by inhibiting liver-specific glycolate oxidase ( GO) , which controls the conversion of glycolate to glyoxylate , the proposed main precursor to oxalate. Alternatively , diminishing the amount of hepatic lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) expression , the proposed key enzyme responsible for converting glyoxylate to oxalate , should directly prevent the accumulation of oxalate in PH patients. Using RNAi , we provide the first in vivo evidence in mammals to support LDH as the key enzyme responsible for converting glyoxylate to oxalate. In addition , we demonstrate that reduction of hepatic LDH achieves efficient oxalate reduction and prevents calcium oxalate crystal deposition in genetically engineered mouse models of PH types 1 ( PH1) and 2 ( PH2) , as well as in chemically induced PH mouse models. Repression of hepatic LDH in mice did not cause any acute elevation of circulating liver enzymes , lactate acidosis , or exertional myopathy , suggesting further evaluation of liver-specific inhibition of LDH as a potential approach for treating PH1 and PH2 is warranted.
