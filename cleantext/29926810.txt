  Sparse phased array ultrasound transducers with millimetre length scale elements have previously been proposed for generating hyperthermia<symptom> but not for imaging. Numerical simulation with a pseudospectral solver was used to investigate: ( a) how the position of the maximum pressure in the focal region changed with element diameter and frequency; ( b) how the size and position of the focal region changed with focal distance under steering; and ( c) the imaging performance of 15 element random arrays. These analyses were performed for both piston-like and non piston-like millimetre diameter elements since previous work has shown a shift in the distance to the maximum pressure in the focal region with the latter. The results for these elements were compared with elements where the diameter was < λ/2. The distance from the array to the position of maximum pressure in the focal region diverged from the value with element diameter < λ/2; values for piston-like elements increased positively whilst values for non piston-like elements increased negatively. With distances expressed in λ , no difference was found for arrays at 1 MHz and 2.5 MHz. For piston-like elements , but not for non piston-like elements , two peaks were found in the focal region which were in-line with the direction of propagation for a focus on the central axis but which rotated to become parallel with the direction of propagation when steering exceeded 20 °. The size and position of the focal region under steering was similar for the non piston-like elements and elements with diameter < λ/2. Little difference was found in image quality or the size of the point spread function ( PSF) between images at 2.5 MHz with piston-like and non piston-like behaviour for steering angles less than 20 ° when compared with a linear array of similar size. These results suggest that imaging with random arrays of millimetre length scale elements is possible.
