  The vertebrate protein STING , an intracellular sensor of cyclic dinucleotides , is critical to the innate immune response and the induction of type I interferon during pathogenic infection. Here , we show that a STING ortholog ( dmSTING) exists in Drosophila , which , similar to vertebrate STING , associates with cyclic dinucleotides to initiate an innate immune response. Following infection with Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> , dmSTING activates an innate immune response via activation of the NF-ÎºB transcription factor Relish , part of the immune deficiency ( IMD) pathway. DmSTING-mediated activation of the immune response reduces the levels of Listeria-induced lethality and bacterial load in the host. Of significance , dmSTING triggers an innate immune response in the absence of a known functional cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( GMP)- AMP synthase ( cGAS) ortholog in the fly. Together , our results demonstrate that STING is an evolutionarily conserved antimicrobial effector between flies and mammals , and it comprises a key component of host defense against pathogenic infection in Drosophila.
