  The influence of the composition within multilayered heterostructure oxide semiconductors has a critical impact on the performance of thin-film transistor ( TFT) devices. The heterostructures , comprising alternating polycrystalline indium oxide and zinc oxide layers , are fabricated by a facile atomic layer deposition ( ALD) process , enabling the tuning of its electrical properties by precisely controlling the thickness of the individual layers. This subsequently results in enhanced TFT performance for the optimized stacked architecture after mild thermal annealing at temperatures as low as 200 °C. Superior transistor characteristics , resulting in an average field-effect mobility ( μ
