  To assess knowledge and attitude of women toward postpartum intrauterine contraceptive device ( PPIUCD) and analyze reasons of refusal. Hospital-based cross-sectional study for 1 year. 550 women were enrolled in the study. Sociodemographic characteristics , knowledge , and attitude toward contraception especially PPIUCD were noted , and the reasons for refusal of PPIUCD were analyzed. SPSS version 17.0 is used. Continuous variables were reported using mean , and categorical variables were reported using percentages. PPIUCD insertion rate was 9.1 %. 78.6 % of women in the study belonged to the age group of 20-30 years , with 79.2 % having education of Class X and above. The overall contraceptive knowledge was 94.4 %. Although 48.4 % women were aware of Cu T as a method of contraception , only 21.9 % of 48.4 % , however , were aware of PPIUCD. None of the women had ever used it before. The commonest prevalent myths regarding Cu T were fear of malignancy ( 38 %) and fear of menorrhagia<symptom> ( 36.4 %). The husband and mother-in-law played important roles in decision regarding PPIUCD insertion and refused the same in 59 % of cases. The study shows that awareness of PPIUCD is low in this region despite good education , leading to high refusal rates. The commonest reason is lack of appropriate counseling , and not only the woman but the husband and mother-in-law also must be provided the knowledge of it as they play important roles in our society.
