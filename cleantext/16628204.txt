  The key objective of scanning probe microscopy ( SPM) techniques is the optimal representation of the nanoscale surface structure and functionality inferred from the dynamics of the cantilever. This is particularly pertinent today , as the SPM community has seen a rapidly growing trend towards simultaneous capture of multiple imaging channels and complex modes of operation involving high-dimensional information-rich datasets , bringing forward the challenges of visualization and analysis , particularly for cases where the underlying dynamic model is poorly understood. To meet this challenge , we present a data-driven approach , Graph-Bootstrapping , based on low-dimensional manifold learning of the full SPM spectra and demonstrate its successes for high-veracity mechanical mapping on a mixed polymer thin film and resolving irregular hydration structure of calcite at atomic resolution. Using the proposed methodology , we can efficiently reveal and hierarchically represent salient material features with rich local details , further enabling denoising , classification , and high-resolution functional imaging.
