  To compare religious denomination , religiosity , guilt , altruism and forgiveness between alcohol-dependent patients and healthy control subjects and to prospectively investigate their relationship to the disorder 's 24-month course following in-patient withdrawal treatment. This study in Franconia ( a mainly Christian protestant region of southern Germany) applied six questionnaires to evaluate religiosity , guilt , altruism and forgiveness in 166 alcohol-dependent in-patients during withdrawal and compared findings with that of 240 healthy controls. Compared to controls religious denomination was more frequently reported by the patients ( OR = 1.72 , P = 0.014) and patients showed higher guilt ( P < 0.001). The subjective attainability of altruism was lower in patients than in controls ( P = 0.015). Higher scores on scale of inter-religious private practice predicted earlier ( Rho = -0.184 , P = 0.021) and more frequent alcohol-related readmissions during the follow-up ( Rho = 0.207 , P = 0.009). Higher religious affiliation was related to earlier ( Rho = -0.214 , P = 0.008) and more frequent alcohol-related readmissions ( Rho = 0189 , P = 0.020). Lower values of subjective attainability of altruism predicted a worse outcome ( earlier ( Rho = 0.231 , P = 0.003) and more frequent readmissions ( Rho = -0.223 , P = 0.004)). The sex-specific analyses show that some of the associations are stronger in women and others are stronger in men; however , these gender differences are small and possibly biased by multiple hypothesis testing. We identified religious denomination , private religious practice , religious affiliation , guilt and reduced attainability of altruism as risk factors for alcohol dependence and a worse follow-up outcome. Our findings may help to establish future preventive and therapeutic strategies.
