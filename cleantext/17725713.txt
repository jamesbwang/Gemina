  The oriental river prawn<disease> , Macrobrachium nipponense , is an important commercial aquaculture resource in China. In order to overwinter , M. nipponense displays decreased physiological activity and less consumption of energy. Sudden warming would trigger molting and cause an extensive death , resulting in huge economic losses. Therefore , it is of great practical significance to study the molting mechanism of oriental river prawns<disease>. Molt-inhibiting hormone gene ( MIH) plays a major role in regulating molting in crustaceans. In this study , a full length MIH cDNA of M. nipponense ( Mn-MIH) was cloned from the eyestalk. The total length of the Mn-MIH was 925 bp , encoding a protein of 119 amino acids. Tissue distribution analysis showed that Mn-MIH was highly expressed in the eyestalk , and that it had relatively low expression in gill , ovary , and abdominal ganglion. Mn-MIH was detected in all developmental stages , and changed regularly in line with the molting cycle of the embryo and larva. Mn-MIH varied in response to the molting cycle , suggesting that Mn-MIH negatively regulates ecdysteroidogenesis. Mn-MIH inhibition by RNAi resulted in a significant acceleration of molting cycles in both males and females , confirming the inhibitory role of MIH in molting. After long-term RNAi males , but not females had significant weight gain , confirming that Mn-MIH plays an important role in growth of M. nipponense. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the role of Mn-MIH in crustacean molting and growth.
