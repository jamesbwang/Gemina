  Hospitalisation with acute kidney injury ( AKI) is associated with short-term and long-term adverse events , but patient and caregiver experiences with AKI are not well described. We sought to better understand patient and caregiver perspectives after a hospitalisation with AKI to inform discharge strategies that may improve outcomes for this high-risk population. Qualitative study with semistructured interviews. Tertiary care hospital in Toronto , Ontario , Canada. Adult patients ( n = 15) who survived a hospitalisation with Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes stage 2 or 3 AKI from May to December 2016. We also interviewed five patient caregivers. We required patients to have no previous evidence of severe chronic kidney disease ( ie , prior receipt of dialysis , previous kidney transplantation or pre-existing estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) under 30 mL/min/1 .73 m We identified three over-arching themes: ( 1) prioritisation of conditions other than AKI , reflected by the importance placed on other comorbidities and the omission of AKI as part of the ongoing medical history; ( 2) variability in comprehension of the significance of AKI , represented by minimal knowledge of the causes and symptoms associated with AKI , along with misinformation on the kidneys ' ability to self-repair; and ( 3) anxiety<symptom> from discharge planning and competing health demands , illustrated by complicated discharge plans involving multiple specialist appointments. Patients and caregivers view AKI as a short-term and reversible condition , giving it little thought during the postdischarge period. As a result , reliance on patients and caregivers to report an episode of AKI to their outpatient physicians is unlikely to be successful. Patient-centred tools and decision aids are needed to bridge the gap between a hospitalisation with AKI and the safe transition to the outpatient setting.
