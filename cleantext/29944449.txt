  We have investigated the magnitude of diurnal variation in back squat and bench press performance using the MuscleLab force velocity transducer. Thirty resistance-trained males ( mean ± SD: age 21.7 ± 1.4 years; body mass 80.5 ± 4.5 kg; height 1.79 ± 0.06 m) underwent two sessions at different times of day: morning ( M , 07:30 h) and evening ( E , 17:30 h). Each session included a period when rectal temperature ( T
