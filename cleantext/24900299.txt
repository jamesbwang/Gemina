  Nanotherapeutic agents ( NTA) play a crucial role in clinical medicine , if their unique properties are well understood and well exploited. In this direction , we report synthesis and characterization of highly potent phytofabricated silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs) using Sechium edule , which served the purpose of both reducing and capping agent. The designed AgNPs were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy , XRD , FTIR , HR-TEM , and TGA techniques. The formation of AgNPs was also confirmed using electrochemistry , which to the best of our knowledge has never been reported before for biosynthesized nanoparticles. The antileishmanial potential of AgNPs was examined on the clinical isolates of Leishmania<pathogen> donovani promastigote cells in an in vitro experimental setting. A dose dependent killing activity of the AgNP was observed with an IC
