  In the present study , Chlorella vulgaris<pathogen> were cultured in the presence of the common plasticizer dibutyl phthalate ( DBP) with different concentrations for 10 days. The cell density , DBP concentrations , neutral lipid concentrations , and lipid morphology in C. vulgaris<pathogen> were studied using optical microscopy , gas chromatography ( GC) , fluorescence spectrophotometry , and laser scanning confocal microscopy ( LSCM). We observed that the neutral lipid contents and cell density of C. vulgaris<pathogen> were negatively influenced by DBP of high concentrations ( 50 and 100 mg/L) , but significantly stimulated by DBP of low concentrations ( 5 , 10 , and 20 mg/L). Lipid bodies were destroyed into pieces by DBP of high concentrations ( 50 and 100 mg/L) , but were slightly suppressed by DBP at low concentrations ( 5 , 10 , and 20 mg/L). Chlorella vulgaris<pathogen> treated with DBP ( 50 mg/L) for 2 days showed the highest removal efficiency ( 31.69 %). The results suggested that C. vulgaris<pathogen> could be used in practice to remove DBP and has the potential of being oleaginous microalgae in DBP contaminated water.
