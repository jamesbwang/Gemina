  Bilateral cleft lip and palate with premaxillary protrusion is a great challenge due to a large defect area. Retraction of the premaxilla before surgery can be done with numerous orthopedic treatment options. In patients who have cleft lip and alveolus , but not cleft palate , it is quite difficult to get to the place where the premaxilla should be. To effectively reach the location where the premaxilla should be , new appliances with expansion and retraction screws were designed. This new design aims to treat the patient with fewer visits. Our study presents the treatment of a case with excessive premaxillary growth and no palatal defect treated with our new design.
