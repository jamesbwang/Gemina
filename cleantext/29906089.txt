  The programmable regulation of chemical reaction networks ( CRNs) represents a major challenge toward the development of complex molecular devices performing sophisticated motions and functions. Nevertheless , regulation of artificial CRNs is generally energy- and time-intensive as compared to natural regulation. Inspired by allosteric regulation in biological CRNs , we herein develop an intramolecular conformational motion strategy ( InCMS) for programmable regulation of DNA CRNs. We design a DNA switch as the regulatory element to program the distance between the toehold and branch migration domain. The presence of multiple conformational transitions leads to wide-range kinetic regulation spanning over 4 orders of magnitude. Furthermore , the process of energy-cost-free strand exchange accompanied by conformational change discriminates single base mismatches. Our strategy thus provides a simple yet effective approach for dynamic programming of complex CRNs.
