  There is accumulating evidence suggesting that diet may play a role in preventing or delaying cognitive decline and dementia , but the underlying biological mechanisms are not well understood. To examine the cross-sectional associations of the Mediterranean diet ( MeDi) and its components with 11C-PiB-PET scan measures of amyloid-β ( Aβ) deposition. The study consisted of 278 Mayo Clinic Study of Aging participants 70 + years old , who were cognitively unimpaired ( CU) at the time of completion of the Food Frequency Questionnaire ( FFQ) and when they underwent PET imaging. Adherence to the MeDi was assessed by computing the MeDi score for each participant. All scans were performed after the FFQ completion; median ( IQR) time between FFQ and Aβ PET was 3.5 ( 1.4) years. Z-scores were created for component , macro- and micronutrients measured. Linear and logistic regression models were adjusted for age , sex , education , apolipoprotein E ( APOE) ɛ4 allele carrier status , time interval between the FFQ completion and PET scan , and total energy intake. Participants ' median age at FFQ was 77.7 years ( 55.8 % men; 26.6 % with an APOE ɛ4 allele). Higher MeDi score ( linear regression slope ( beta): -0.035 , p = 0.012; per standard deviation increase) , vegetable intake ( beta: -0.043 , p = 0.002) , intake of vitamin A ( beta: -0.041 , p = 0.003) or β-carotene ( beta: -0.039 , p = 0.005) from food sources and moderate alcohol consumption ( beta: -0.074 , p = 0.03) were associated with lower 11C-PiB standardized uptake value ratio. Findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that higher adherence to a MeDi pattern and higher vegetable consumption are associated with better neuroimaging biomarker profile. Prospective studies are needed to validate current findings.
