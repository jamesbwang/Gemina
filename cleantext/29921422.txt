  Exosomes are now considered to be involved in mediating cell-to-cell communication to promote or inhibit tumor progression. However , the role and molecular mechanism of exosomes in promoting glioblastoma ( GBM) metastasis remains elusive. Here , we found that circulating exosomal miR-148a levels were significantly higher in serum from GBM patients compared with serum from healthy volunteers. In T98G cells , inhibition of miR-148a suppressed cell proliferation and metastasis. In addition , we identified Cell adhesion molecule 1 ( CADM1) as a target gene of miR-148a using luciferase reporter assay. Both protein and mRNA levels of CADM1 were decreased in tissues from GBM patients. There was a strong negative correlation between exosomal miR-148a and CADM1 mRNA levels in samples of patients. Moreover , miR-148a antagonist increased p-STAT3 protein level to activate STAT3 pathway. In conclusion , our findings indicated that miR-148a delivered by exosomes may promote cancer cell proliferation and metastasis via targeting CADM1 to activate STAT3 pathway , suggesting a predictor and therapeutic target role of exosomal miR-148a in GBM patients.
