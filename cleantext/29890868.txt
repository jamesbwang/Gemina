  Pheochromocytoma ( PH) is a tumor that arises from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. Though being this benign neoplasm very rare in pregnancies , lack of treatment nevertheless causes high mortality rates for both the mother and the fetus. Classic symptoms related to PH are hypertension , abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> , diaphoresis , and headache<symptom> but it can be easily misdiagnosed as gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. Its appearance is sporadic , but there are some genetic disorders that favor its onset ( e.g. MEN 2A and 2B). Individual management is needed , because no single protocol is suitable in such a complex and rare condition. In this paper we describe our experience in the clinical and surgical management of a young pregnant patient affected by PH , and in particular the specific and unique pharmacological treatment with doxazosin , the use of corticosteroids and a close monitoring of fetal well-being , which proved being an effective approach.
