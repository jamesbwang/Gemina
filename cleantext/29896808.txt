  The avian circadian system is a complex of mutually coupled pacemakers residing in pineal gland , retina and suprachiasmatic nucleus. In this study , the self-regulation mechanism of pineal circadian rhythm was investigated by culturing chick primary pinealocytes exposed to red light ( RL) , green light ( GL) , blue light ( BL) , white light ( WL) and constant darkness ( DD) , respectively. All illuminations were set up with a photoperiod of 12 light: 12 dark. The 24-h expression profiles of seven core clock genes ( cBmal1/2 , cClock , cCry1/2 , and cPer2/3) , cAanat and melatonin showed significant circadian oscillation in all groups , except for the loss of cCry1 rhythm in BL. Compared to WL , GL increased the amplitudes and mesors of positive elements ( cClock , cBmal1/2) and reduced those of negative elements ( cCry1/2 , cPer2/3) , in contrast to RL. The temporal patterns of cAanat mRNA and melatonin secretion have always been consistent with the positive genes. Besides , GL advanced the acrophases of the positive elements , cAanat and melatonin , but RL and BL showed the opposite effect. Thereby , GL could promote the secretion of melatonin by enhancing the expressions of positive clock genes and repressing the expressions of negative clock genes.
