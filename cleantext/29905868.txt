  CK2 is an essential protein kinase implicated in various cellular processes. In this study , we address a potential role of this kinase in chromatin modulations associated with transcription. We found that CK2 depletion from yeast cells leads to replication-independent increase of histone H3K56 acetylation and global activation of H3 turnover in coding regions. This suggests a positive role of CK2 in maintenance/recycling of the histone H3/H4 tetramers during transcription. Interestingly , strand-specific RNA-seq analyses show that CK2 inhibits global cryptic promoters driving both sense and antisense transcription. This further indicates a role of CK2 in the modulation of chromatin during transcription. Next , we showed that CK2 interacts with the major histone chaperone Spt6 , and phosphorylates it in vivo and in vitro. CK2 phosphorylation of Spt6 is required for its cellular levels , for the suppression of histone H3 turnover and for the inhibition of spurious transcription. Finally , we showed that CK2 and Spt6 phosphorylation sites are important to various transcriptional responses suggesting that cryptic intragenic and antisense transcript production are associated with a defective adaptation to environmental cues. Altogether , our data indicate that CK2 mediated phosphorylation of Spt6 regulates chromatin dynamics associated with transcription , and prevents aberrant transcription.
