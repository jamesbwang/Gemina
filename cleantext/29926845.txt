  In tissue engineering there is growing interest in fabricating highly engineered platforms designed to instruct cells towards the synthesis of tissues that reproduce their natural counterpart. In this context , a fundamental factor to take into account is the control over the final tissue orientation , especially for what concerns the replication of load-bearing tissues whose functions are strictly related to their microstructural organization. Starting from this point , in this work we have engineered a gelatin-based hydrogel in order to be patterned by 2-photon polymerization ( 2PP) lithography for the fabrication of instructive free standing building blocks designed to produce anisotropic collagen-based μtissues. Biological results clearly highlighted the strong relationship between μtissue orientation and such topographies , which resulted in a crucial element in the production of highly anisotropic μtissues.
