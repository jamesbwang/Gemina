  Acute liver injury in patients with ARDS decreases survival but early stages may be easily missed due to the lack of sufficient biomarkers signalling its onset. Accordingly , we tested in ARDS patients the hypotheses that microRNA-122 , the foremost liver-related microRNA ( miR) , 1) is an sensitive and specific early predictor for potential liver injury and 2) analysed its impact on 30-day-survival. We collected clinical data and analysed blood samples from 119 ARDS patients within the first 24 h of ICU admission and from 20 patients undergoing elective abdominal non-liver surgery serving as controls. Total circulating miR was isolated from serum and relative miR-122 expression was measured ( using specific probes and spiked-in miR-54) , as were liver function and 30-day survival. Acute liver injury was defined as a total bilirubin concentration ≥ 3.0 mg/dl , an ALT activity ≥ 350 U/l , and an INR ≥ 2.0. 30-day survival of the entire ARDS-cohort was 69 % but differed between patients with normal liver function ( 77 %) and acute liver injury ( 19 % p < 0.001). miR-122 expression was 20fold higher in non-survivors ( 95 %- CI 0.0149-0.0768; p = 0.001) and almost 4fold greater in survivors ( 95 %- CI: 0.0037-0.0122; p = 0.005) compared to controls ( 95 %- CI 0.0008-0.0034) and correlated with markers of liver cell integrity/function ( ALT ( p < 0.001 , r = 0.495) , AST ( p < 0.001 , r = 0.537) , total bilirubin ( p = 0.025 , r = 0.206) , INR ( p = 0.001 , r = 0.308) , and GLDH ( p < 0.001 , r = 0.489)). miR-122 serum expression discriminated survivors and non-survivors ( AUC: 0.78) better than total bilirubin concentration ( AUC: 0.66). Multivariable Cox-regression analysis revealed both acute liver injury ( HR 7.6 , 95 %- CI 2.9-19.8 , p < 0.001) and miR-122 ( HR 4.4 , 95 %- CI 1.2-16.1 , p = 0.02) as independent prognostic factors for 30-day mortality. Increased miR-122 serum expression is an early and independent risk factor for 30-day mortality in ARDS patients and potentially reveal an acute liver injury earlier than the conventional markers of liver cell integrity.
