  Intervertebral disc degeneration is a leading cause of chronic low back pain ( LBP) but current treatment is limited. Toll-like receptors ( TLRs) on disc cells are activated by endogenous extracellular matrix ( ECM) fragments and modulate degeneration in vitro. This study investigated whether inhibiting TLR4 slows disc degeneration and reduces behavioral signs of LBP in vivo. 7-9-month old wild-type and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine ( SPARC)- null ( a model of disc degeneration and LBP) male mice were treated with TAK-242 ( TLR4 inhibitor) once , and following a 10-day washout , mice were treated 3 times/week for 8 weeks. Behavioral signs of axial discomfort and radiating leg<symptom> pain<symptom> were assessed weekly with the grip force assay and acetone test , respectively. Following treatment , pain-related spinal cord changes were evaluated and lumbar discs were excised and cultured. Cytokine secretion from discs was evaluated with protein arrays. SPARC-null mice displayed elevated signs of axial and radiating pain at baseline compared to wild-type. Chronic , but not acute , TLR4 inhibition reduced behavioral signs of pain compared to vehicle. SPARC-null mice have increased calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP)- and glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP)- immunoreactivity ( astrocyte marker) in the dorsal horn compared to wild-type , which is reduced by chronic TLR4 inhibition. Ex vivo degenerating discs from SPARC-null mice secrete increased levels of many pro-inflammatory cytokines , which chronic TLR4 inhibition reduced. Chronic TLR4 inhibition decreased behavioral signs of LBP , pain-related neuroplasticity and disc inflammation<symptom> in SPARC-null mice. TAK-242 inhibits TLR4 activation within discs , as evidenced by decreases in cytokine release. Therefore , TLRs are potential therapeutic targets to slow disc degeneration and reduce pain.
