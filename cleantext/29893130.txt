  Molecular dynamics computer simulations have been conducted for ethanol-water liquid mixtures in the water-rich side of the composition range , with 10 , 20 , and 30 mol % of alcohol , at temperatures between room temperature and the experimental freezing point of the given mixture. All-atom-type ( optimized potential for liquid simulations) interatomic potentials have been assumed for ethanol , in combination with two kinds of rigid water models ( SPC/E and TIP4P/2005). Both combinations have provided excellent reproductions of the experimental X-ray total structure factors at each temperature; this yielded a strong basis for further structural analyses. Beyond partial radial distribution functions , various descriptors of hydrogen-bonded assemblies , as well as of the hydrogen-bonded network have been determined. A clear tendency was observed toward that an increasing proportion of water molecules participate in hydrogen bonding with exactly two donor and two acceptor sites as temperature decreases. Concerning larger assemblies held together by hydrogen bonding , the main focus was put on the properties of cyclic entities: it was found that , similarly to methanol-water mixtures , the number of hydrogen-bonded rings has increased with lowering temperature. However , for ethanol-water mixtures , the dominance of 5-fold rings , and not 6-fold rings , could be observed.
