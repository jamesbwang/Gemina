  p53 is a powerful transcription factor playing a pivotal role in the prevention of cancer development and in maintaining genome integrity. This oncosuppressor is found to be functionally inactivated by mutations in many human tumors. Accordingly , wild type p53 and its oncogenic mutants represent valuable cancer biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. We developed a highly sensitive biosensor , based on Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy , for detection of wild type p53 and of p53
