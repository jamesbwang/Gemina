  Glycosylation is considered one of the most complex and structurally diverse post-translational modifications of proteins. Glycans play important roles in many biological processes such as protein folding , regulation of protein stability , solubility and serum half-life. One of the ways to study glycosylation is systematic structural characterizations of protein glycosylation utilizing glycomics methodology based around mass spectrometry ( MS). The most prevalent bottleneck stages for glycomic analyses is laborious sample preparation steps. Therefore , in this study , we aim to improve sample preparations by automation. We recently demonstrated the successful application of an automated high-throughput ( HT) , glycan permethylation protocol based on 96-well microplates , in the analysis of purified glycoproteins. Therefore , we wanted to test if these developed HT methodologies could be applied to more complex biological starting materials. Our automated 96-well-plate based permethylation method showed very comparable results with established glycomic methodology. Very similar glycomic profiles were obtained for complex glycoprotein/protein mixtures derived from heterogeneous mouse tissues. Automated N-glycan release , enrichment and automated permethylation of samples proved to be convenient , robust and reliable. Therefore we conclude that these automated procedures are a step forward towards the development of a fully automated , fast and reliable glycomic profiling system for analysis of complex biological materials.
