  After routine workup , 23-25 % of ischemic strokes etiology remains unknown , i.e. cryptogenic. However , according to international results pathogenic patent foramen ovale<disease> ( PFO) reveals in 25 % of these cases. Aim of our retrospective study to prove the substantial etiological role of PFO-related stroke ( PFO-RS) in cryptogenic strokes ( CS) , and to identify age related differences in stroke etiology. All new ischemic strokes of 2014-2015 were classified by ASCOD ( Atherosclerosis , Small-vessel disease , Cardiac pathology , Other , Dissection) phenotyping. CS was defined when the etiology was unknown. With the help of special ultrasound techniques and RoPE ( Risk of Paradoxical Embolism) score the portion of PFO-RS were determined in the examined CS population. Moreover , etiological distribution and differences between age groups ( < 40 , 40-60 , > 60 years) were described. During the examined period , 8.12 % of 985 new ischemic strokes were categorized as CS. 41.38 % of examined CS were found to be PFO-related. PFO-RS were considerably more frequent in the younger age groups than in the older age groups. The probability of appearance of PFO-RS were significantly higher in younger age than in case of age independency. Our results verify the substantial etiological role of PFO-RS in CS , and confirm the essential role of contrast enhanced functional transcranial Doppler in the routine diagnostic workup. Age related differences in stroke etiology were found to be statistically significant ( p = 0.000 , df = 14) , in which small-vessel disease , cardiac pathology , dissection , other pathologies , CS and PFO-RS were contributed significantly. Based on our results , till in young age rare etiologies are typical , while in older age classical etiologies are mainly characteristic.
