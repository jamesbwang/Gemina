  The concept of resistant hypertension may be changed during pregnancy by the physiological hemodynamic changes and the particularities of therapy choices in this period. This review discusses the management of pregnant patients with preexisting resistant hypertension and also of those who develop severe hypertension in gestation and puerperium. The main cause of severe hypertension in pregnancy is preeclampsia , and differential diagnosis must be done with secondary or primary hypertension. Women with preexisting resistant hypertension may need pharmacological therapy adjustment. Several drugs can be used to treat severe hypertension , with exception of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. The most used drugs are methyldopa , beta-blockers , and calcium channel antagonists. There is a general agreement that severe hypertension must be treated , but there are still debates over the goals of the treatment. Delivery is indicated in viable pregnancies in which blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control is not achieved with three drugs in full doses. Resistant hypertension may arise in postpartum. The management of resistant hypertension in pregnancy must regard the possible etiology , the fetal well-being , and the mother 's risk. Good care is mandatory to reduce maternal mortality risk.
