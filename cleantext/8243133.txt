  The recurrence rate in lumbar disc herniations ( LDH) has been reported between 5 and 25 %. There are only few data about this phenomenon that occurs within days of the initial operation. We analyse early recurrent LDH by analysis of data from the German Spine register. Data from patients undergoing disc herniation surgery in the lumbar region were extracted from the German Spine Registry between 1st January 2012 and 31st December 2016. Patients with early recurrent LDH within days of initial surgery were separately analysed. A total of 9310 surgeries for LDH were documented in the German Spine Register. From these patients 115 ( 1.2 %) presented an early recurrent disc surgeries within days of the initial surgery. The mean age was 70 Â± 2.50 years. Most affected segment was L4/5 ( 47 cases , 41 %) , followed by L3/4 ( 45 cases , 39 %). The most of our patients showed a normal or overweight Body Mass Index. Surgery for early recurrent LDH was associated with a high rate of incidental durotomies ( 20 cases , 17.6 %). In 3 cases ( 2.6 %) therapy with a lumbar drain was necessary. The rate of early recurrent LDH within days of surgery is 1.2 %. Age seems to be an important factor in early recurrent LDH while obesity does not. The data of the German Spine Register seems to have a reliable data collection system that can perform multicentre data analysis. The databases from this Register could be used in the future for various purposes , such as the evaluation of multicentre surgical techniques , results in patients with various surgical procedures and basic research in spine surgery.
