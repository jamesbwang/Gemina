  We review our approach to resection of colorectal polyps < 20 mm in size. Careful inspection of all lesions<symptom> is appropriate to assess the type of lesion<symptom> ( adenoma vs serrated) and evaluate the risk of cancer , which is highly associated with lesion<symptom> size. Polyp resection is in the midst of a `` cold revolution , '' particularly for lesions<symptom> < 10 mm in size , but also for some larger lesions<symptom>. Cold forceps are sometimes appropriate for 1- to 2-mm lesions<symptom> that can be engulfed in one bite , but we use cold snaring for almost the entire set of lesions<symptom> < 10 mm. For 10- to 19-mm conventional adenomas , we rely primarily on hot snare resection. Endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR) , preferably en bloc , is appropriate for bulky nongranular conventional adenomas and nongranular adenomas with depression<symptom> in this size range. For sessile serrated polyps 10 to 19 mm in size our approaches differ to some extent , with one of us using primarily `` cold EMR , '' and the other using primarily hot EMR technique.
