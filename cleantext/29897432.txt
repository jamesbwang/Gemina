  By examining the reconstructed gastric tube during esophagectomy using indocyanine green fluorescence ( ICG) angiography , we have established a ' 90-second rule ' to confirm good blood perfusion at the anastomosis site. We examined the surgical outcome ( rate of anastomotic leakage) of 70 consecutive patients who underwent esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction using ICG fluorescence angiography. All of the anastomoses were made in the area where less than 90 seconds was needed for enhancement using ICG fluorescence angiography ( i.e. within the 90-second rule). In 18 cases for which the time until enhancement of the gastric tube tip exceeded 60 seconds , the anastomosis site was decided by reference to the ICG fluorescence angiogram , and the hypoperfused area was excised , and this significantly shortened the median time until enhancement of the gastric tube tip from 95.5 ( 60.0-204.0) seconds to 41.0 ( 9.0-77.0) seconds ( P < 0.001). In three cases , the anastomosis was made at the site where more than 60 seconds was needed for ICG enhancement. In one case where ICG enhancement had taken 77 seconds , minor anastomotic leakage occurred. The overall rate of anastomotic leakage in this series was 1.4 %. Blood flow in the reconstructed gastric tube is sufficient if the anastomosis is made in the area where ICG fluorescence angiography demonstrates enhancement within 60 seconds. Gastric tube necrosis<symptom> can be avoided if the area showing an enhancement time exceeding 90 seconds is excised. The 90-second rule is a safe and effective method for deciding the site of anastomosis.
