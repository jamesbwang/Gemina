  The discovery of mutant or fusion kinases that drive oncogenesis , and the subsequent approval of specific inhibitors for these enzymes , has been instrumental in the management of some cancers. However , acquired resistance remains a significant problem in the clinic , limiting the long-term effectiveness of most of these drugs. Here we demonstrate a general strategy to overcome this resistance through drug-induced MEK cleavage ( via direct procaspase-3 activation) combined with targeted kinase inhibition. This combination effect is shown to be general across diverse tumor histologies ( melanoma , lung cancer , and leukemia<disease>) and driver mutations ( mutant BRAF or EGFR , fusion kinases EML4-ALK and BCR-ABL). Caspase-3-mediated degradation of MEK kinases results in sustained pathway inhibition and substantially delayed or eliminated resistance in cancer cells in a manner far superior to combinations with MEK inhibitors. These data suggest the generality of drug-mediated MEK kinase cleavage as a therapeutic strategy to prevent resistance to targeted anticancer therapies.
