  To describe the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2 DM) in rural Deqing County , Zhejiang Province , and explore its risk factors. Random cluster sampling was used to select 8 rural communities in Deqing County , Zhejiang Province , and a cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2006-2008 , 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 , respectively. Totally , 6562 eligible subjects were investigated in 2006-2008 , 11 763 eligible subjects in 2011-2012 , and 10 904 eligible subjects in 2013-2014. Data on demography , life style and disease history , and physical examination such as height , weight and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> were collected. Also , fasting plasma glucose was tested. T2 DM was defined as who having fasting plasma glucose â‰¥ 7. 0 mmol/L or was diagnosed by doctors or receiving diabetic treatment. In 2006-2008 , 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 , the standardized prevalences of T2 DM were 1. 2 % , 1. 6 % and 2. 1 % and those of impaired fasting glucose ( IFG) were 7. 2 % , 18. 7 % and22. 8 % , respectively. There were increasing trends over years for both. After adjustment for other covariates in logistic regression , age ( compared with age between 18 to 39. 9 years old: aOR _ ( 40-59. 9) = 5. 20 , 95 % CI 2. 74-9. 89; aOR _ ( 60-) = 8. 02 , 95 % CI 4. 19-15. 35) , female ( aOR = 1. 23 , 95 % CI 1. 02-1. 49) , family history of T2 DM ( aOR = 4. 86 , 95 % CI 3. 49-6. 77) , overweight/obesity ( overweight: aOR = 1. 88 , 95 % CI1. 61-2. 20; obesity: aOR = 5. 10 , 95 % CI 4. 06-6. 41) , hypertension ( aOR = 2. 84 , 95 % CI 2. 44-3. 31) , having meat mainly ( aOR = 2. 25 , 95 % CI 1. 89-2. 69) and tea drinking ( aOR = 0. 81 , 95 % CI 0. 68-0. 95) were significantly correlated with T2 DM. The prevalence of T2 DM increased over time in rural Deqing County , China. Age , gender , family history of T2 DM , overweight or obesity , hypertension , diet and drinking tea were significantly related to T2 DM.
