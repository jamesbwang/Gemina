  The capacity for total knee arthroplasty to improve pain , quality of life , and functional outcomes is widely recognized. Postoperative mortality is rare but of paramount importance , and needs to be accurately quantified and conveyed to patients in order to support decision-making prior to surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine a contemporary estimate of the risk of mortality following total knee arthroplasty , including the identification of temporal trends , common causes , and modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors. We performed a systematic review with searches of MEDLINE , AMED , CAB Abstracts , and Embase. Studies in any language published from 2006 to 2016 reporting 30 or 90-day mortality following total knee arthroplasty were included , supplemented by contact with authors. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed for quantitative data. Thirty-seven studies with mortality data from 15 different countries following over 1.75 million total knee arthroplasties formed the basis of this review. The pooled Poisson-normal random-effects meta-analysis estimates of 30 and 90-day mortality were 0.20 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.17 % to 0.24 %) and 0.39 % ( 95 % CI , 0.32 % to 0.49 %). Both estimates have fallen over the 10-year study period ( p < 0.001). Meta-regression using the median year of surgery as a moderator showed that 30 and 90-day mortality following total knee arthroplasty fell to 0.10 % ( 95 % CI , 0.07 % to 0.14 %) and 0.19 % ( 95 % CI , 0.15 % to 0.23 %) , respectively , in 2015. The leading cause of death was cardiovascular disease. There is an ongoing worldwide temporal decline in mortality following total knee arthroplasty. Improved patient selection and perioperative care and a healthy-population effect may account for this observation. Efforts to further reduce mortality should be targeted primarily at reducing cardiovascular events following total knee arthroplasty. Therapeutic Level IV.
