  The dynamic strength index ( DSI) , often calculated as the ratio of countermovement jump ( CMJ) propulsion peak force to isometric mid-thigh pull ( IMTP) peak force , is said to inform whether ballistic or maximal strength training is warranted for a given athlete. CMJ propulsion peak force is highly influenced by jump strategy , however , which is not highlighted by the DSI alone. This study aimed to quantitatively compare CMJ force- , power- , velocity- , and displacement-time curves between athletes who achieved high versus low DSI scores. Fifty-three male collegiate athletes performed three CMJs and IMTPs on a force platform. Athletes were ranked based on DSI score and the CMJ kinetic and kinematic-time curves of the bottom and top twenty athletes were compared. The low DSI group ( 0.55 ± 0.10 vs. 0.92 ± 0.11) produced greater IMTP peak force ( 46.7 ± 15.0 vs. 31.1 ± 6.6 N · kg
