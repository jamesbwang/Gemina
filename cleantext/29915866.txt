  Concentrations were measured three times from 2006 to 2013 at major harbors and marine areas along the Korean coast. The Cu concentration in seawater and sediments increased , while the Zn concentration first decreased and then increased. The pattern of increase in Cu concentration with time was consistent with the increased total tonnage of ships moored at the sampling area and with the increased discharge of organic antifouling agents. To confirm the relationship between seawater and marine sediments in heavy metal pollution , all data were arrayed and compared depending on concentrations. The results revealed that the slope of Cu between seawater and marine sediment rapidly decreased , attributed to the increase in the application of copper-based antifouling agents to vessels after the ban on the use of tributyltin in 2008 , rather than the contamination caused by industrial areas.
