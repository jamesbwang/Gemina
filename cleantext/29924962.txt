  Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 ( ALDH1) has been identified as a marker of cancer stem cells in breast cancer ( BC). Recent studies showed that ALDH1 expression is correlated with poor prognostic parameters and worse clinical outcome in BC. We evaluated ALDH1 expression by immunohistochemistry in a series of 217 invasive BCs and investigated the correlation between ALDH1 expression and clinicopathological parameters , molecular subtypes ( luminal A , luminal B , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2) type , and triple-negative BC ( TNBC)) , and patient survival. There was a significant association between ALDH1 expression and tumor grade ( p < 0.001) , i.e. , the expression of ALDH1 was higher in high-grade tumors. ALDH1 expression was significantly associated with estrogen and progesterone receptor ( ER and PR) negativity ( p < 0.001) and HER2 positivity ( p = 0.001). ALDH1 expression ratios were higher in HER2 type and TNBC. There was a statistically significant correlation between ALDH1 negativity and luminal A subtype ( p < 0.001). The overall and disease free survival were shorter in ALDH1 + tumors , although without statistical significance. We confirm that ALDH1 is a potentially important , poor prognostic factor in BC , associated with high histological grade , ER/PR negativity and HER2 positivity. For more accurate results , ALDH1 expression should be evaluated in larger case series including various types/subtypes of BC.
