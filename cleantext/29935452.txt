  A bio-electrochemical reactor ( BER) operating at different cathode potentials ranging from -300 to -1000 mV ( vs standard hydrogen electrode , SHE) was used to reduce adsorbable organic halogens ( AOX) in pharmaceutical wastewater. Cathode polarization enriched the electron donor of the biological system. Thus , the AOX removal efficiency in the BER improved from 59.9 % to 70.2 % , and the AOX removal rate increased from 0.87 to 1.17 mg AOX/h when the cathode potential was reduced from -300 to -1000 mV with the addition of methyl viologen , a known redox mediator. The decrease of the cathode potential was also beneficial for methane production , and the inhibition of the methanogenic process enhanced the AOX removal. Additionally , cathode coulombic efficiency analysis demonstrated that the proportion of electrons used for AOX reduction decreases with decreasing potential , from 37.6 % at -300 mV to 17.3 % at -1000 mV , although the AOX removal efficiency improves.
