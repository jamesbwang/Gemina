  Obesity can negatively impact intestinal homeostasis , and increase colon cancer risk and related mortality. Thus , given the alarmingly high rates of obesity in the US and globally , it is critical to identify practical strategies that can break the obesity-cancer link. Walnuts have been increasingly recognized to mitigate cancer risk , and contain many bioactive constituents with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that could potentially counteract pathways thought to be initiators of obesity-related cancer. Therefore , the purpose of this study was to determine if walnuts could preserve intestinal homeostasis , and attenuate tumorigenesis and growth in the context of obesity and a high calorie diet. To this end , we studied effects of walnuts on these parameters under different dietary conditions in wildtype mice , two independent
