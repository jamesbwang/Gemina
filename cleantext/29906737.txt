  Compare the estimated Achilles tendon ( AT) loading using a musculoskeletal model during commonly performed weight bearing therapeutic exercises. Controlled laboratory study. University biomechanics laboratory. Eighteen healthy males ( Age: 22.1 ± 1.8 years , height: 177.7 ± 8.4 cm , weight = 74.29 ± 11.3 kg). AT loading was estimated during eleven exercises: tandem , Romberg , and unilateral standing , unilateral and bilateral heel raising , unilateral and bilateral jump landing , squat , lunge , walking , and running. Kinematic and kinetic data were recorded at 180 Hz and 1800 Hz respectively. These data were then used in a musculoskeletal model to estimate force in the triceps surae. AT cross-sectional images were measured by ultrasound to determine AT stress. A repeated measure multivariate analysis of variance ( α = 0.05) was used on AT loading variables. Squat and unilateral jump landing were the most different in AT stress. Peak AT stress variables were generally greater during more dynamic , unilateral exercises compared to more static , bilateral exercises. Bilateral , more static exercises resulted in less AT loading and may serve as a progression during the rehabilitation compared to more dynamic , unilateral exercises.
