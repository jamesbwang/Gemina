  Signalling pathways play vital roles as determinants of almost all the molecular processes inside a eukaryotic cell. They are more often considered to be the link between extracellular and intracellular environmental cues. Gene silencing pathways have emerged to be involved in regulation of stress responses and developmental processes. However , very little is known about the crosstalk between signalling and silencing pathways and their influence on each other. The present work describes the effects of general protein kinase inhibitors and specific mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK) pathway inhibitors on the components of microRNA pathway in rice. The kinase inhibitors significantly reduced the activities of miRNA biogenesis complex and changed the transcript expression of miRNA pathway factors. This study suggests a possible regulation of microRNA machinery by plant kinases and MAP kinases in particular.
