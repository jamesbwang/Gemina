  The objective of this review is to critically assess the contributing role of the gut microbiota in human obesity and type 2 diabetes ( T2D). Experiments in animal and human studies have produced growing evidence for the causality of the gut microbiome in developing obesity and T2D. The introduction of high-throughput sequencing technologies has provided novel insight into the interpersonal differences in microbiome composition and function. The intestinal microbiota is known to be associated with metabolic syndrome<disease> and related comorbidities. Associated diseases including obesity , T2D , and fatty liver disease ( NAFLD/NASH) all seem to be linked to altered microbial composition; however , causality has not been proven yet. Elucidating the potential causal and personalized role of the human gut microbiota in obesity and T2D is highly prioritized.
