  Meglumine antimoniate ( Glucantime) is an antimonial pentavalent used to treat leishmaniasis<disease> , despite its acknowledged toxic effects , such as its ability to cause oxidative damage to lipids and proteins. Recently , our group demonstrated that meglumine antimoniate causes oxidative stress-derived DNA damage. Acknowledging that antioxidants modulate reactive oxygen species , we evaluated the capacity of genistein and ascorbic acid for preventing genotoxicity caused by meglumine antimoniate. For that , mice ( n = 5/group) received genistein ( via
