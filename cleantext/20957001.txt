  Jumonji D3 ( JMJD3) histone demethylase epigenetically regulates development and differentiation , immunity , and tumorigenesis by demethylating a gene repression histone mark , H3K27-me3 , but a role for JMJD3 in metabolic regulation has not been described. SIRT1 deacetylase maintains energy balance<symptom> during fasting by directly activating both hepatic gluconeogenic and mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation genes , but the underlying epigenetic and gene-specific mechanisms remain unclear. In this study , JMJD3 was identified unexpectedly as a gene-specific transcriptional partner of SIRT1 and epigenetically activated mitochondrial β-oxidation , but not gluconeogenic , genes during fasting. Mechanistically , JMJD3 , together with SIRT1 and the nuclear receptor PPARα , formed a positive autoregulatory loop upon fasting-activated PKA signaling and epigenetically activated β-oxidation-promoting genes , including Fgf21 , Cpt1a , and Mcad. Liver-specific downregulation of JMJD3 resulted in intrinsic defects in β-oxidation , which contributed to hepatosteatosis as well as glucose and insulin intolerance. Remarkably , the lipid-lowering effects by JMJD3 or SIRT1 in diet-induced obese mice were mutually interdependent. JMJD3 histone demethylase may serve as an epigenetic drug target for obesity , hepatosteatosis , and type 2 diabetes that allows selective lowering of lipid levels without increasing glucose levels.
