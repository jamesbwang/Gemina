  Using knowledge- and structure-based approaches , we designed and synthesized reversible chemical probes that simultaneously inhibit the activity of two epigenetic targets , histone 3 lysine 9 methyltransferase ( G9a) and DNA methyltransferases ( DNMT) , at nanomolar ranges. Enzymatic competition assays confirmed our design strategy: substrate competitive inhibitors. Next , an initial exploration around our hit 11 was pursued to identify an adequate tool compound for in vivo testing. In vitro treatment of different hematological neoplasia cell lines led to the identification of molecules with clear antiproliferative efficacies ( GI
