  The alarming health issues especially the unusually high number of cancer cases in agriculture community of Bathinda district of Punjab ( India) is a serious concern. There is limited knowledge about the role of gene-environment interactions in oncogenesis prevalent in this area. The aim of present study was to evaluate the association of oxidative stress with CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , CYP3A4 and PON1 genetic variation in the pesticide exposed ( occupationally) population of Bathinda district of Punjab ( India). The present study demonstrated significantly elevated relative risk ( RR) of lower antioxidant defense mechanism ( Glutathione , Catalase , Superoxide Dismutase , Glutathione peroxidases , Glutathione Reductase) in occupationally pesticide-exposed group ( n = 120) as compared to unexposed group ( n = 84) from Bathinda district of Punjab ( India). Our data shows pesticide exposure to be a major risk factor leading to increased oxidative stress inside the body. Gas chromatographic analysis revealed the residues of organophosphates ( chlorpyriphos , dichlorvos , ethoprophos) and herbicides ( atrazine , butachlor , alachlor , metolachlor) in the blood samples of the exposed population. In-vitro results showed a dose dependent decrease in cell viability following treatment of pesticides detected in blood samples in hPBMCs and A549 cell line. Genetic variation analysis revealed missense mutations in CYP2B6 ( 2 mutations) , CY3A4 ( 1 mutation) and CYP2C9 ( 2 mutations). The observed mutations have been predicted to cause structural and conformation change in protein structure which could result in altered stability. In first of its kind of study , our data reveals oxidative stress and pesticide residue accumulation inside the body<symptom> to be the major reasons for health concerns in Bathinda district.
