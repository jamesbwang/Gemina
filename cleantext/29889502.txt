  ( +)- Stephadiamine is an unusual alkaloid isolated from the vine Stephania japonica<pathogen>. It features a norhasubanan skeleton , and contains two adjacent α-tertiary amines , which renders it an attractive synthetic target. Here , we present the first total synthesis of stephadiamine , which hinges on an efficient cascade reaction to implement the aza ( 4.3.3) propellane core of the alkaloid. The α-aminolactone moiety in a highly hindered position was installed via Tollens reaction and Curtius rearrangement. Useful building blocks for the asymmetric synthesis of morphine and ( nor) hasubanan alkaloids are introduced.
