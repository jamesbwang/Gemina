  Genetically engineered bacteria for pollution control of heavy metal have been widely studied , however , using Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> ( P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen>) that can adapt to various circumstances to remediate heavy metal pollution is rarely reported. In this study , we employed CadR , a cadmium ( Cd)- specific binding protein , displaying on the surface of P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> with chromosomal expression. The genetically engineered ( GE) P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> still flourished in the 30th generation in the LB broth which contained 100 μM Cd ( II) , exhibiting an excellent genetic stability. Chromosomally expressed P aeruginosa showed an adsorption capacity of up to 131.9 μmol/g of Cd ( II). In addition , the low concentration of the coexisting two valence ions has no significant effect on adsorption capacity of Cd ( II). This study provides a direction for application of P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> in environment remediation.
