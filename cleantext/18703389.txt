  Local propeller flaps preserve the main vascular arteries of the lower extremity and muscle function , avoiding the need for a microsurgical anastomosis and the benefit of providing a `` like with like '' coverage. Our goal in this study was to demonstrate the versatility , safety , and complications of the local propeller flaps for lower extremity reconstruction. We present a series of 28 patients in whom we used local propeller flaps to restore small-to-medium soft-tissue defects of the lower limb in different hospitals of Managua , Nicaragua. Flap average dimensions were of 48 cm In our opinion , the availability and safety of local propeller flaps , justifies its use in cases where microsurgical techniques are not an option for the reconstruction of the middle and distal extremity , in small-to-medium defects of soft-tissue coverage of the lower limb.
