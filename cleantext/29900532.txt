  Mixed methods can foster depth and breadth in psychological research. However , its use remains in development in psychotherapy research. Our purpose was to review the use of mixed methods in psychotherapy research. Thirty-one studies were identified via the PRISMA systematic review method. Using Creswell & Plano Clark 's typologies to identify design characteristics , we assessed each study for rigor and how each used mixed methods. Key features of mixed methods designs and these common patterns were identified: ( a) integration of clients ' perceptions via mixing; ( b) understanding group psychotherapy; ( c) integrating methods with cases and small samples; ( d) analyzing clinical data as qualitative data; and ( e) exploring cultural identities in psychotherapy through mixed methods. The review is discussed with respect to the value of integrating multiple data in single studies to enhance psychotherapy research.
