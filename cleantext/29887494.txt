  Counseling patients with written materials relies equally on patients ' health literacy to understand their disease and its treatment , and the written materials ' effectiveness communicating clearly in accessible and actionable ways. Only about 12 % of the US population is adequately health literate. To explore the impact of reducing the health literacy demands of written patient health information. 805 patients were screened for health literacy , and recruited for balanced cohorts of adequate and low literacy , and high and normal blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. Half of each patient cohort received either standard or `` health literacy-friendly '' drug summaries ( i.e. Patient Package Inserts , or PPIs or `` leaflets '') along with a standardized health literacy assessment scale. The literacy-friendly drug summary improved comprehension of drug-related information overall from 50 % to 71 % correct responses. Adequate literacy patients improved from 58 % correct to 90 % , while lower literacy patients improved from 42 % to 52 % correct in response to the health literacy-friendly PPIs. Health literacy demands require special attention in developing and using written drug summary materials. Additionally , pharmacists should be provided additional information and counseling support materials to facilitate communications with low health literacy level patients.
