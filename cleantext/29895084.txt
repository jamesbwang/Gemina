  The surgical treatment of corneal dystrophies develops rapidly as the use of lamellar corneal grafting techniques continue. While penetrating keratoplasty was the gold standard for treating a variety of dystrophies a few years ago , the affected layers of the cornea can , nowadays , be selectively replaced or ablated using laser technology. Of particular importance for these methods is optical coherence tomography , which has recently been integrated into surgical microscopes ( MI-OCT). Literature overview from PubMed and Google.scholar.de supplemented with own imaging data. The MI-OCT enables the intraoperative real-time monitoring of different ophthalmic surgical procedures , such as deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty , Descemet 's membrane endothelial keratoplasty , as well as minimally-invasive procedures , such as phototherapeutic keratectomy. In addition , it enables an evaluation of the cornea , but also of structures of the anterior chamber , in situations in which the cornea , for example , is clouded by an edema<symptom>. Microscope-integrated , intraoperative optical coherence tomography ( MI-OCT) represents a useful supplement to the normal surgical microscope. It is superior to the sole surgical microscope , especially in already severely clouded corneas<symptom> , and represents a sensible supplement , especially for novel lamellar transplantation procedures. Prospective randomized trials are necessary to increase safety and efficacy when using MI-OCT for different indications.
