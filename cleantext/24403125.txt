  Previous research has sought to quantify head impact exposure using wearable kinematic sensors. However , many sensors suffer from poor accuracy in estimating impact kinematics and count , motivating the need for additional independent impact exposure quantification for comparison. Here , we equipped seven collegiate American football players with instrumented mouthguards , and video recorded practices and games to compare video-based and sensor-based exposure rates and impact location distributions. Over 50 player-hours , we identified 271 helmet contact periods in video , while the instrumented mouthguard sensor recorded 2,032 discrete head impacts. Matching video and mouthguard real-time stamps yielded 193 video-identified helmet contact periods and 217 sensor-recorded impacts. To compare impact locations , we binned matched impacts into frontal , rear , side , oblique , and top locations based on video observations and sensor kinematics. While both video-based and sensor-based methods found similar location distributions , our best method utilizing integrated linear and angular position only correctly predicted 81 of 217 impacts. Finally , based on the activity timeline from video assessment , we also developed a new exposure metric unique to American football quantifying number of cross-verified sensor impacts per player-play. We found significantly higher exposure during games ( 0.35 , 95 % CI: 0.29-0.42) than practices ( 0.20 , 95 % CI: 0.17-0.23) ( p < 0.05). In the traditional impacts per player-hour metric , we observed higher exposure during practices ( 4.7) than games ( 3.7) due to increased player activity in practices. Thus , our exposure metric accounts for variability in on-field participation. While both video-based and sensor-based exposure datasets have limitations , they can complement one another to provide more confidence in exposure statistics.
