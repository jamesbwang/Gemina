  To describe and illustrate the key findings on structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) in the most common dementias of neurodegenerative origin: Alzheimer 's disease , vascular dementia , dementia with Lewy bodies , variants of frontotemporal dementia , progressive supranuclear palsy , variants of multiple system atrophy , Parkinson dementia , and corticobasal degeneration. Today the role of MRI is no longer limited to ruling out underlying causes of cognitive deterioration. MRI can show patterns of atrophy with a predictive value for certain dementias which , although not specific or unique to each disease , can help to confirm diagnostic suspicion or to identify certain processes. For this reason , it is important for radiologists to know the characteristic findings of the most common dementias.
