  To describe the successful management of acute kidney injury ( AKI) secondary to oak intoxication using hemodialysis in a miniature zebu. A 1-year-old male intact miniature zebu was presented for evaluation of a 2-day history of lethargy<symptom> , anorexia<symptom> , decreased urine production , and dry , firm stool<symptom>. Initial diagnostics revealed severe azotemia and the bull was presumptively diagnosed with AKI secondary to oak intoxication due to free access to oak trees in the pasture. Despite conventional management with IV fluids and supportive therapy , the degree of azotemia progressively worsened , and the bull became oliguric and fluid overloaded. Two treatments with hemodialysis resulted in reduction of azotemia and ketonemia , and resolution of fluid overload and oliguria. The zebu was discharged from the hospital after 10 days of hospitalization. To the authors ' knowledge , this is the first reported case using hemodialysis for AKI in a bovid. Treatment with hemodialysis was effective in this case resulting in rapid resolution of azotemia , fluid overload , and oliguria. Hemodialysis may hasten the recovery and decrease morbidity and mortality in bovids with AKI.
