  In the current study , we have tested the nonenzymatic glycation activities of ketohexoses , such as tagatose and psicose. Although tagatose-treated apoA-I ( t-A-I) and psicose-treated apoA-I ( p-A-I) exerted more inhibitory activity you cupric ion-mediated low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) oxidation and oxidized LDL ( oxLDL) phagocytosis into macrophage than fructose-treated apoA-I ( f-A-I). In the lipid-free state , t-A-I and f-A-I showed more multimerized band without crosslinking. Since t-A-I lost its phospholipid binding ability , the rHDL formation was not as successful as f-A-I. However , injecting t-A-I showed more antioxidant activities in zebrafish embryo under the presence of oxLDL. Three weeks of consumption of fructose ( 50 % of wt in Tetrabit/4 % cholesterol) showed a 14 % elevation of serum triacylglycerol ( TG) , while tagatose-administered group showed 30 % reduction in serum TG compared to high cholesterol control. Fructose-fed group showed the biggest area of Oil Red O staining with the intensity as strong as the HCD control. However , tagatose-consumed group showed much lesser Oil Red O-stained area with the reduction of lipid accumulation. In conclusion , although tagatose treatment caused modification of apoA-I , the functional loss was not as much severe as the fructose treatment in macrophage cell model , zebrafish embryo , and hypercholesterolemic zebrafish model.
