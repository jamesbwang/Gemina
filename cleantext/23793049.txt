  Clinical data research networks ( CDRNs) invest substantially in identifying and investigating data quality problems. While identification is largely automated , the investigation and resolution are carried out manually at individual institutions. In the PEDSnet CDRN , we found that only approximately 35 % of the identified data quality issues are resolvable as they are caused by errors in the extract-transform-load ( ETL) code. Nonetheless , with no prior knowledge of issue causes , partner institutions end up spending significant time investigating issues that represent either inherent data characteristics or false alarms. This work investigates whether the causes ( ETL , Characteristic , or False alarm) can be predicted before spending time investigating issues. We trained a classifier on the metadata from 10,281 real-world data quality issues , and achieved a cause prediction F1-measure of up to 90 %. While initially tested on PEDSnet , the proposed methodology is applicable to other CDRNs facing similar bottlenecks in handling data quality results.
