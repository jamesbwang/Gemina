  To investigate the effectiveness of levator muscle resection combined with Mustarde 's double Z-plasty to correct blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome<disease> ( BPES). Between March 2015 and June 2017 , one-stage operation of levator muscle resection combined with Mustarde 's double Z-plasty were performed on 26 children with bilateral BPES. There were 16 boys and 10 girls with an average age of 7 years ( range , 4-14 years). All patients marked the four typical signs of BPES. There were 7 cases accompanied with a low nasal bridge , and 20 cases with amblyopia and strabismus. The length of eye fissure was ( 19.5 ± 4.5) mm , the width of eye fissure was ( 2.5 ± 1.6) mm , the diameter of inner canthus was ( 42.1 ± 6.5) mm , and the muscular strength of levator palpebrae superioris was ( 5.5 ± 1.3) mm. All the incisions healed by first intention. Twenty-three patients were followed up 2-12 months , with an average of 10 months. Among which , 2 cases were less corrected , 3 cases were over corrected , 6 cases had poor curvature of the eyelid. No eyelid internal and external pronation or keratitis<disease> occurred. Amelioration of blepharoptosis and epicanthus was achieved in the other patients , and the double eyelid fold was naturally smooth. At 7 days after operation , the length of eye fissure was ( 27.2 ± 1.9) mm , the width of eye fissure was ( 12.5 ± 1.3) mm , and diameter of inner canthus was ( 29.4 ± 2.6) mm , which were superior to preoperative values ( The levator muscle resection combined with Mustarde 's double Z-plasty can effectively correct BPES and obtain good effectiveness.
