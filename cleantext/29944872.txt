  We developed a high-throughput technique for highly sensitive measurement of trace amounts of proline , an indicator of drought stress in plants , using an optimized proline-ninhydrin reaction. In order to do this , proline detection time was minimized by omitting phosphoric acid from the ninhydrin reagent. Chromophore extraction using toluene was also omitted , thus lowering the risks to environment and human health , and allowing the use of readily available polystyrene plates. Proline detection sensitivity was assessed based on the concentration of sulfosalicylic acid in the solution , which indicated that 1 % sulfosalicylic acid yielded the best sensitivity and linearity. These findings were applied to a multiwell plate-based multiplex analysis using a dry oven for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of drought-stressed plant samples with trace amounts of proline. The results showed that proline could be effectively detected in plants grown in soil with water content under 5 % , demonstrating its potential for diagnosing drought early. The proposed multiwell plate-based multiplex assay is expected to be useful in manifold agricultural applications.
