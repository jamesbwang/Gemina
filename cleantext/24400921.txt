  Bone metastases ( BMs) are common in patients with breast cancer and can lead to skeletal-related events ( SREs) , which are associated with increased pain and reduced quality of life ( QoL). Bone-targeted agents ( BTAs) , like zoledronic acid and denosumab , reduce the incidence of SREs and delay progression of bone pain. We evaluated the management of BMs and pain in six European countries ( Belgium , France , Germany , Italy , Spain , and UK) using the Adelphi Breast Cancer Disease Specific Programme , which included a physician survey and patient-reported outcomes ( PROs) to assess the impact of BMs on pain and QoL. 301 physicians completed patient record forms for 2984 patients with advanced breast cancer; 1408 with BMs and 1136 with metastases at sites other than bone ( non-BMs). Most patients with BMs ( 88 %) received a BTA , with 81 % receiving treatment during 3 months following BM diagnosis. For those who did not receive a BTA , the main reasons given were: very recent BM diagnosis , perceived low risk of bone complications , and short life expectancy. Most patients with BMs ( 68 %) were experiencing bone pain and , of these , 97 % were taking analgesics ( including 28 % receiving strong opioids). Despite this , moderate to severe<symptom> pain<symptom> was reported in 20 % of patients who were experiencing pain. PROs were assessed in 766 patients with advanced breast cancer ( 392 with BMs , 374 with non-BMs). Overall , patients with BMs reported worse pain and QoL outcomes than those with non-BMs , those not receiving a BTA reported worse pain. Despite the large proportion of patients receiving BTAs in this study , some patients with BMs are still not receiving early treatment to prevent SREs or to manage pain. Improving physicians ' understanding of the role of BTAs and the importance of early treatment following BM diagnosis has the potential to improve patient care.
