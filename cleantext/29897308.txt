  Correlations between fatigue-induced changes in exercise performance and maximal rate of heart rate ( HR) increase ( rHRI) may be affected by exercise intensity during assessment. This study evaluated the sensitivity of rHRI for tracking performance when assessed at varying exercise intensities. Performance ( time to complete a 5-km treadmill time-trial ( 5TTT)) and rHRI were assessed in 15 male runners following 1 week of light training , 2 weeks of heavy training ( HT) , and a 10-day taper ( T). Maximal rate of HR increase ( measured in bpm · s Time to complete a 5-km treadmill time-trial was likely slower following HT ( effect size ± 90 % confidence interval = 0.16 ± 0.06) , and almost certainly faster following T ( -0.34 ± 0.08). Maximal rate of HR increase during 5 min of running at 8 km · h The 5TTT performance was tracked by both rHRI
