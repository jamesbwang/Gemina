  Balanced crystalloid solutions induce less hyperchloremia than normal saline , but their role as primary fluid replacement for children undergoing surgery is unestablished. We hypothesized that balanced crystalloids induce less chloride and metabolic derangements than 0.9 % saline solutions in children undergoing brain tumor resection. In total , 53 patients ( age range , 6 mo to 12 y) were randomized to receive balanced crystalloid ( balanced group) or 0.9 % saline solution ( saline group) during and after ( for 24 h) brain tumor resection. Serum electrolyte and arterial blood gas analyses were performed at the beginning of surgery ( baseline) , after surgery , and at postoperative day 1. The primary trial outcome was the absolute difference in serum chloride concentrations ( post-preopΔCl) measured after surgery and at baseline. Secondary outcomes included the post-preopΔ of other electrolytes and base excess ( BE); hyperchloremic acidosis incidence; and the brain relaxation score , a 4-point scale evaluated by the surgeon for assessing brain edema<symptom>. Saline infusion increased post-preopΔCl ( 6 ( 3.5; 8.5) mmol/L) compared with balanced crystalloid ( 0 ( -1.0; 3.0) mmol/L; P < 0.001). Saline use also resulted in increased post-preopΔBE ( -4.4 ( -5.0; -2.3) vs. -0.4 ( -2.7; 1.3) mmol/L; P < 0.001) and hyperchloremic acidosis incidence ( 6/25 ( 24 %) vs. 0; P = 0.022) compared with balanced crystalloid. Brain relaxation score was comparable between groups. In children undergoing brain tumor resection , saline infusion increased variation in serum chloride compared with balanced crystalloid. These findings support the use of balanced crystalloid solutions in children undergoing brain tumor resection.
