  Previous studies showed that mepolizumab significantly reduces exacerbations and oral corticosteroid use in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. However , early studies reported inconsistent effects on lung function. This study specifically assessed the onset of clinical effect and the relationship of baseline blood eosinophil count of mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneous ( SC) administration on morning peak expiratory flow ( AM PEF). Post hoc analysis of data from two randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled studies ( MENSA , NCT01691521; MUSCA , NCT02281318) of 4-weekly mepolizumab 100 mg versus placebo in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Individual study results were generated using a mixed model repeated measures model controlling for multiple covariates and were combined using a fixed effects meta-analysis via inverse-variance weighting. Significant improvements in AM PEF after the first dose of mepolizumab 100 mg SC vs. placebo were seen as early as week 1 and continued to improve further with subsequent doses. The mean change in AM PEF was 26 L/min in the mepolizumab group compared to 4 L/min in the placebo group , p < 0.001. When the population was stratified by blood eosinophil thresholds the mean difference from placebo was 24 L/min ( ≥ 150 cells/µL) , 27 L/min ( ≥ 300 cells/µL) , and 34 L/min ( ≥ 500 cells/µL) , p < 0.001 for all subgroups. The < 150 cells/µL ( ≥ 300 cells/µL in the previous year) group increased 13 L/min , while both 150 to < 300 cells/µL and 300 to < 500 cells/µL ranges demonstrated comparable changes ( 19 L/min and 17 L/min) , respectively. Our analysis has shown early and consistent improvements in lung function measured by AM PEF using the study enrollment criterion of ≥ 150 eosinophils/µL. We also identified a relationship between baseline blood eosinophils and improvements in AM PEF with mepolizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. GlaxoSmithKline ( study ID 208091).
