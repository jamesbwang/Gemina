  The antigenic makeup of tumour cells can have a profound effect on the progression of cancer and success of immunotherapies. Therefore , one strategy to improve the efficacy of cancer treatments is to augment the antigens displayed by tumours. The present study explores how the recognition of tumour cells may be altered by non-cytotoxic concentrations of gemcitabine ( GEM). Testing a panel of chemotherapeutics in human cancer cell lines
