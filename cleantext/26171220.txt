  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease<pathogen> is a leading cause of chronic liver disease<pathogen> that can lead to cirrhosis , hepatocellular cancer , and end-stage liver disease<pathogen> , and it is linked to elevated cardiovascular- and cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Insulin resistance related to metabolic syndrome<pathogen> is the main pathogenic trigger that , in association with adverse genetic , lifestyle , and other factors , precipitates the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.<pathogen> Biochemical markers and radiological imaging , along with liver biopsy in selected cases , help in the disease<pathogen> 's diagnosis and prognostication. Weight<pathogen> loss<pathogen> is the cornerstone treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease;<pathogen> however , it is difficult to achieve and maintain , so pharmacotherapy was developed. The remarkable evolution in understanding disease<pathogen> pathogenesis has led to the development of new medical therapies and even the modification of currently available ones. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the epidemiology , natural history , pathogenesis , diagnosis , and management of non-alcoholic fatty liver
