  Internal ice formation leads to wholesale changes in ionic , osmotic and pH homeostasis , energy metabolism , and mechanical damage , across a small range of temperatures , and is thus an abiotic stressor that acts at a distinct , physiologically-relevant , threshold. Insects that experience repeated freeze-thaw cycles over winter will cross this stressor threshold many times over their lifespan. Here we examine the effect of repeatedly crossing the freezing threshold on short-term physiological parameters ( metabolic reserves and cryoprotectant concentration) as well as long-term fitness-related performance ( survival and egg production) in the freeze-tolerant goldenrod gall fly
