  Defect engineering is promising for tailoring the properties of atomically thin materials. By creating defects via Se vacancies , we study the optoelectronic properties of monolayer PbSe. We obtain the single-particle properties using the density functional theory plus a first-principles-based typical medium approximation. The absorption spectra are explored by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Our results reveal that monolayer PbSe is defect-sensitive but defect-tolerant. The latter fingerprint is due to the absence of defect-induced in-gap , localized states. Our results predict that Se vacancies are the dominant defect type in disordered PbSe monolayer. We observe that increasing Se vacancy concentrations Î´ renormalize the energy bandgap E
