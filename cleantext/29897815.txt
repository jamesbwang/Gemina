  This study explores the long-term effects of exposure to a maternal Western diet ( WD) vs. standard diet ( SD) in the Yucatan minipig , on the adult progeny at lean status ( n = 32) , and then overweight status. We investigated eating behavior , cognitive abilities , brain basal glucose metabolism , dopamine transporter availability , microbiota activity , blood lipids , and glucose tolerance. Although both groups demonstrated similar cognitive abilities in a holeboard test , WD pigs expressed a higher stress level than did SD pigs ( immobility , P < 0.05) and lower performance in an alley maze ( P = 0.06). WD pigs demonstrated lower dopamine transporter binding potential in the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex ( P < 0.05 for both) , as well as a trend in putamen ( P = 0.07) , associated with lower basal brain activity in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens ( P < 0.05) compared with lean SD pigs. Lean WD pigs demonstrated a lower glucose tolerance than did SD animals ( higher glucose peak , P < 0.05) and a tendency to a higher incremental area under the curve of insulin from 0 to 30 minutes after intravenous glucose injection ( P < 0.1). Both groups developed glucose intolerance with overweight , but WD animals were less impacted than SD animals. These results demonstrate that maternal diet shaped the offspring 's brain functions and cognitive responses long term , even after being fed a balanced diet from weaning , but behavioral effects were only revealed in WD pigs under anxiogenic situation; however , WD animals seemed to cope better with the obesogenic diet from a metabolic standpoint.-Gautier , Y. , Luneau , I. , Coquery , N. , Meurice , P. , Malbert , C.-H. , Guerin , S. , Kemp , B. , Bolhuis , J.
