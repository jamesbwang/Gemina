  The gastrointestinal hormone cholecystokinin ( CCK) regulates digestive processes and satiety in addition to centrally mediated effects on nociception and anxiety<symptom>. CCK signals through two seven-trans-membrane receptors named the CCK-1 receptor and the CCK-2 receptor. The expression pattern and biological effects mediated by the CCK-1 and CCK-2 receptors are highly divergent. The pig is a widely used preclinical animal model in medical research , but up until recently , the porcine CCK-2 receptor was described as a pseudogene in the publicly available genomic sequence databases. Thus , it was challenging to interpret data from this animal model in studies of CCK biology and pharmacology. Here we describe an in silico prediction of the porcine CCK-2 receptor and the subsequent cloning , expression , and in vitro pharmacological characterization. We find a high degree of sequence homology with the human orthologue as well as CCK-2 receptors of other major species used in pre-clinical research. We also show that the endogenous ligands CCK-8 and Gastrin-17 bind and activate the porcine CCK-2 receptor with similar affinities and potencies as seen for the human CCK-2 receptor. We conclude that the pig has a functional CCK-2 receptor which is highly comparable to the human orthologue and therefore the pig qualifies as a valid preclinical model for the study of human CCK biology and pharmacology.
