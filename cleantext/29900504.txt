  Viroporins are short polypeptides encoded by viruses. These small membrane proteins assemble into oligomers that can permeabilize cellular lipid bilayers , disrupting the physiology of the host to the advantage of the virus. Consequently , efforts during the last few decades have been focused towards the discovery of viroporin channel inhibitors , but in general these have not been successful to produce licensed drugs. Viroporins are also involved in viral pathogenesis by engaging in critical interactions with viral proteins , or disrupting normal host cellular pathways through coordinated interactions with host proteins. These protein-protein interactions ( PPIs) may become alternative attractive drug targets for the development of antivirals. In this sense , while thus far most antiviral molecules have targeted viral proteins , focus is moving towards targeting host proteins that are essential for virus replication. In principle , this largely would overcome the problem of resistance , with the possibility of using repositioned existing drugs. The precise role of these PPIs , their strain- and host- specificities , and the structural determination of the complexes involved , are areas that will keep the fields of virology and structural biology occupied for years to come. In the present review , we provide an update of the efforts in the characterization of the main PPIs for most viroporins , as well as the role of viroporins in these PPIs interactions.
