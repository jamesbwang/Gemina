  Rice paddy soil is recognized as the hotspot of mercury ( Hg) methylation , which is mainly a biotic process mediated by many abiotic factors. In this study , effects of key soil properties on the production and bioaccumulation of Hg and methylmercury ( MeHg) in Hg-contaminated rice paddies were investigated. Rice and soil samples were collected from the active Hg smelting site and abandoned Hg mining sites ( a total of 124 paddy fields) in the Wanshan Mercury Mine , China. Total Hg ( THg) and MeHg in soils and rice grains , together with sulfur ( S) , selenium ( Se) , organic matter ( OM) , nitrogen ( N) , phosphorus ( P) , mineral compositions ( e.g. , SiO
