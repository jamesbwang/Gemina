  Background Comparable oncological outcomes have been seen after surgical nephrectomy and thermal ablation of renal tumors recently. However , periprocedural outcome needs to be assessed for aiding treatment decision. Purpose To compare efficacy rates and periprocedural outcome ( technical success , session time , hospitalization time , and complications) after renal tumor treatment with laparoscopic partial nephrectomy ( LPN) or radiofrequency ablation ( RFA). Material and Methods The initial experience with 49 ( treated with LPN) and 84 ( treated with RFA) consecutive patients for a single renal tumor ( diameter â‰¤ 5 cm , limited to the kidney) during 2007-2014 was evaluated. Patient and tumor characteristics , efficacy rates , and periprocedural outcome were collected retrospectively. The stratified Mantel Haenzel and Van Elteren tests , adjusted for tumor complexity ( with the modified R.E.N.A.L nephrometry score ( m-RNS)) , were used to assess differences in treatment outcomes. Results Primary efficacy rate was 98 % for LPN and 85.7 % for RFA; secondary efficacy rate was 93.9 % for LPN and 95.2 % for RFA; and technical success rate was 87.8 % for LPN and 100 % for RFA. Median session ( m-RNS adjusted P < 0.001; LPN 215 min , RFA 137 min) and median hospitalization time were longer after LPN ( m-RNS adjusted P < 0.001; LPN 5 days , RFA 2 days). Side effects were uncommon ( LPN 2 % , RFA 4.8 %). Complications were more frequent after LPN ( m-RNS adjusted P < 0.001; LPN 42.9 % , RFA 10.7 %). Conclusion Both methods achieved equivalent secondary efficacy rates. RFA included several treatment sessions , but session and hospitalization times were shorter , and complications were less frequent than for LPN. The differences remained after adjustment for renal tumor complexity.
