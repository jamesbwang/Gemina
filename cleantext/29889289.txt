  To evaluate the long-term effect of glistenings and surface light scattering of intraocular lenses ( IOLs) on visual and optical performance after cataract surgery. Pseudophakic eyes that underwent standard phacoemulsification and two types of hydrophobic acrylic spherical IOL implantation without complications for at least 5 years were included in this retrospective study. Participants were divided into the glistenings , surface light scattering , and control groups according to the current condition of the IOLs. Then participants received a follow-up examination including uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity ( UDVA and CDVA) , contrast sensitivity , straylight , and intraocular higher order aberrations , as well as point spread function ( PSF) and modulation transfer function ( MTF). A total of 140 eyes were included in the study. UDVA , CDVA , and glare sensitivity were not significantly different among the three groups ( P > .05). However , compared with the control group , the IOLs of the glistenings and surface light scattering groups were associated with significantly lower contrast sensitivity under no glare conditions. Furthermore , eye with glistenings exhibited the highest straylight value ( P < .05) , whereas no difference was found between the surface light scattering and control groups. In contrast to the control group , the spherical aberration increased and the mean values of PSF and MTF decreased in the glistenings and surface light scattering groups. Both glistenings and surface light scattering tend to impair subjective visual performance , such as contrast sensitivity , and potentially affect objective optical quality , including straylight , spherical aberration , PSF , and MTF.
