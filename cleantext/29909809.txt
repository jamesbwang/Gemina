  As model-based economic evaluations ( MBEEs) are widely used to make decisions in the context of policy , it is imperative that they represent clinical practice. Here , we assess the relevance of MBEEs on dabigatran for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF). We performed a systematic review on the basis of a developed questionnaire , tailored to oral anticoagulation in patients with AF. Included studies had a full body text in English , compared dabigatran with a vitamin K antagonist , were not dedicated to one or more subgroup ( s) , and yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The relevance of all MBEEs was assessed on the basis of ten context-independent factors , which encompassed clinical outcomes and treatment duration. The MBEEs performed for the United States were assessed on the basis of seventeen context-dependent factors , which were related to the country 's target population and clinical environment. The search yielded twenty-nine MBEEs , of which six were performed for the United States. On average , 54 percent of the context-independent factors were included per study , and 37 percent of the seventeen context-dependent factors in the U.S.. The share of relevant factors per study did not increase over time. MBEEs on dabigatran leave out several relevant factors , limiting their usefulness to decision makers. We strongly urge health economic researchers to improve the relevance of their MBEEs by including context-independent relevance factors , and modeling context-dependent factors befitting the decision context concerned.
