  Three new sulfated isoguanine alkaloid glycosides , designated as saikachinoside A monosulfate ( 1) , saikachinoside A disulfate ( 2) , and locustoside B disulfate ( 3) , have been isolated from the pupal case of the wild bruchid seed beetle Bruchidius dorsalis ( Chrysomelidae , Bruchinae) infesting the seed of Gleditsia japonica<pathogen> Miq. ( Fabaceae). Their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods and the inhibitory activity of 2 and 3 against acid phosphatase was evaluated.
