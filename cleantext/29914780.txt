  East African ( EA) women are a subpopulation who are at very high risk for gestational diabetes ( GDM) and poor obstetric outcomes , but little is known about the care experiences of this understudied group. The objective of this study was to document the impact of a diagnosis of GDM and the perceptions of diabetes care among EA immigrant women. Semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 EA immigrant women diagnosed with GDM in Calgary; they were recruited from community and tertiary care settings. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive thematic content analysis to explore participants ' experiences when accessing and receiving care. EA immigrant women had varied experiences related to GDM. Thematic analysis revealed the negative impact of GDM diagnoses on women , including the burdens of self-care , fear , community influences and cultural and financial barriers. The positive impacts of the experience of diagnosis noted were primarily in the empowerment to make healthful behaviour changes. Study findings point to the need for more context-specific and culturally appropriate support and care. Diagnoses of GDM extended beyond the individuals affected and impacted their families culturally , psychologically and financially. Addressing the emergent themes during pregnancy is imperative to improving care providers ' engagement with EA immigrant women in postpartum diabetes screening activities and beyond. The findings of this study contain elements transferable to other immigrant groups in similar socioecologic contexts.
