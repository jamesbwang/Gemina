  To research the biological characteristics of different generations of rabbit nucleus pulposus cells ( NPCs) that were cultured with natural culture and subculture method. The thoracolumbar segments of New Zealand white rabbits ( 6-8 weeks old and weighing 1.5-2.5 kg) were obtained and nucleus pulposus were isolated from disc regions. And NPCs were harvested by enzymatic digestion from nucleus pulposus. Primary NPCs were counted as P0 generation. Then , NPCs were passaged by trypsin and counted as P1 , P2 , P3 with a totle of 4 generations. P0 to P3 generations NPCs were separately examined by observation of cell morphology and proliferation time , detection of apoptosis rates of cells by flow cytometry , and detection of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α ( HIF-1α) , matrix metalloproteinases 2 ( MMP-2) , Aggrecan , and collagen type Ⅱ proteins by immunofluorescence and Western blot. The morphology of NPCs transformed from triangular or polygonal in P0 generation to spindle in P3 generation; the characteristic vacuolated cells gradually disappeared; and the cell volume and cell proliferation time increased. The cell apoptosis rates were 5.47 % ± 0.91 % , 13.77 % ± 2.42 % , 33.46 % ± 1.82 % , and 38.76 % ± 1.50 % from P0 to P3 generations , with the increase of culture time , and there were significant differences between 4 generations ( Rabbit NPCs degeneration model was successfully established by the natural culture and subculture method. Transforming of NPCs morphology , increasing of cell apoptosis rates , decreasing of anabolism , and increasing of catabolism were presented in NPCs degeneration model.
