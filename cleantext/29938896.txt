  There is a need for single cell analysis methods that enable the identification and localization of different kinds of biomolecules throughout cells and intact tissues , thereby allowing characterization and classification of individual cells and their relationships to each other within intact systems. Expansion microscopy ( ExM) is a technology that physically magnifies tissues in an isotropic way , thereby achieving super-resolution microscopy on diffraction-limited microscopes , enabling rapid image acquisition and large field of view. As a result , ExM is well-positioned to integrate molecular content and cellular morphology , with the spatial precision sufficient to resolve individual biological building blocks , and the scale and accessibility required to deploy over extended 3-D objects like tissues and organs.
