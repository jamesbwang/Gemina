  Aesthetic breast implant augmentation surgery is the most popular plastic surgery worldwide. Many women choose to receive breast implants during their reproductive ages , although the long-term effects are still controversial. Research aim: We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the influence of aesthetic breast augmentation on breastfeeding. We also compared the exclusive breastfeeding rates of periareolar versus inframammary incision. A systematic search for comparative studies about breast implants and breastfeeding was performed in PubMed , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , ScienceDirect , Scopus , and Web of Science through May 2018. Meta-analysis was conducted with a random-effects model ( or fixed effects , if heterogeneity was absent). Four cohorts and one cross-sectional study were included. There was a significant reduction in the exclusive breastfeeding rate for women with breast implants compared with women without implants , pooled relative risk = 0.63 , 95 % confidence interval ( 0.46 , 0.86) , as well as the breastfeeding rate , pooled relative risk = 0.88 , 95 % confidence interval ( 0.81 , 0.95). There was no evidence that periareolar incision was associated with a reduction in the exclusive breastfeeding rate , pooled relative risk = 0.84 , 95 % confidence interval ( 0.45 , 1.58). Participants with breast implants are less likely to establish breastfeeding , especially exclusive breastfeeding. Periareolar incision does not appear to reduce the exclusive breastfeeding rate.
