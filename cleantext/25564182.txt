  Antioxidant proteins can be beneficial in disease prevention. More attention has been paid to the functionality of antioxidant proteins. Therefore , identifying antioxidant proteins is important for the study. In our work , we propose a computational method , called SeqSVM , for predicting antioxidant proteins based on their primary sequence features. The features are removed to reduce the redundancy by max relevance max distance method. Finally , the antioxidant proteins are identified by support vector machine ( SVM). The experimental results demonstrated that our method performs better than existing methods , with the overall accuracy of 89.46 %. Although a proposed computational method can attain an encouraging classification result , the experimental results are verified based on the biochemical approaches , such as wet biochemistry and molecular biology techniques.
