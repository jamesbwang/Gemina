  OBJECTIVE To evaluate the clinical performance of a veterinary benchtop dry chemistry analyzer for measurement of plasma ammonium concentrations in dogs by comparing results with those obtained by a reference standard test method. DESIGN Prospective evaluation study. SAMPLE 32 blood samples from 30 dogs ( 16 with and 14 without suspected hepatobiliary disease). PROCEDURES Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture. A veterinary benchtop dry chemistry analyzer and a reference standard ( enzymatic) test method were used to measure ammonium concentrations in plasma collected from heparinized whole blood. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess intermethod agreement. Results were compared by linear regression , and correlation was calculated by the Pearson method. Samples were classified as having high or normal ammonium concentrations on the basis of cutoff data for the relevant test method; results were compared between methods to evaluate diagnostic agreement. RESULTS 31 of 32 ( 97 %) samples were classified correctly with the benchtop analyzer; 1 sample with a high ammonium concentration was classified as having a normal value ( ie , false-negative result) by this method. A strong positive correlation ( r
