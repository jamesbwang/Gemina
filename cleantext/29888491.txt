  Tungsten-based catalysts are promising candidates to generate hydrogen effectively. In this work , a single-W-atom catalyst supported on metal-organic framework ( MOF)- derived N-doped carbon ( W-SAC) for efficient electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) , with high activity and excellent stability is reported. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy ( HAADF-STEM) and X-ray absorption fine structure ( XAFS) spectroscopy analysis indicate the atomic dispersion of the W species , and reveal that the W
