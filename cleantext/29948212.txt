  Results to date suggest that microalgal Thraustochytrids family strains can be used to produce high-functional omega-3 rich oil ( ~ 30-70 % of dry cell weight) and carotenoid-based antioxidant pigments simultaneously with value-added bioactive potential. In the present study , we describe the isolation and characterization of a new Thraustochytrid Schizochytrium sp. from the west<disease> coastal area of Korea. This newly isolated Thraustochytrid , identified as Schizochytrium sp. through 18S rRNA analysis and named SH104 , simultaneously produces high levels of DHA and carotenoid-based antioxidant pigments. An improved Schizochytrium mutant , named SHG104 , was obtained from the original host strain by Î³-irradiation-induced mutagenesis. Under combined temperature-shift cultivation conditions employing white-light LEDs ( light-emitting diodes) , Schizochytrium sp.. SHG104 yielded 10.8 g L
