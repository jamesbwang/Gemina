  Anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase implicated as a driver of a number of cancer types , and activates cellular pathways involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs) are a small molecule therapeutic that blocks ALK function , but tumor evolution leads to the rapid emergence of drug resistant somatic variation and necessitates selection of a new treatment strategy. Computational simulations of protein: drug interactions were used to investigate the impact of seven drug resistant mutations on binding to eleven TKIs approved , or under investigation , for treatment of ALK positive cancers. The results show variant specific disruptions to TKI molecular interactions , and demonstrate the potential to aid prioritization of therapeutic interventions. Validation remains a challenge due to the complex dependence of biomolecular interactions on the local biophysical environment , but improvements to the underlying structural model and continued curation efforts will improve the clinical utility of computational predictions.
