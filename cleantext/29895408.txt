  A molecular bottlebrush functionalized magnetic adsorbent ( magGO@bottlebrush) was fabricated in this work. Poly ( hydroxyethyl methacrylate) ( PHEMA) was first grafted from polydopamine coated magnetic graphene oxide via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization ( SI-ATRP) to produce the backbone of the molecular bottlebrush. Further modification was followed by grafting poly ( styrene) via a second SI-ATRP from the PHEMA chains to yield the magGO@bottlebrush. Multiple interactions including hydrophobic , π-π stacking and π-π electron-donor-acceptor interactions greatly contributed to the solute retention. The adsorbent possessed unique shape selectivity , it provided high affinity to non-planar and non-linear compounds. Profiting from densely grafted phenyl and carbonyl groups on the adsorbent , multivalent interactions were exploited to enhance the selectivity for analytes with multiple recognition motifs. Bisphenol A ( BPA) was chosen as a model analyte to test real applications of the adsorbent , considering its structural features. The adsorbent owns high adsorption capacity to BPA , and can be readily used for rapid and efficient enrichment of trace BPA from water samples.
