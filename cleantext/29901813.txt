  Drought stress during reproductive development could drastically reduce grain number and wheat yield , but quantitative evaluation of such effect is unknown under climate change. The objectives of this study were to a) evaluate potential yield benefits of drought tolerance during reproductive development for wheat ideotypes under climate change in Europe , and b) identify potential cultivar parameters for improvement. We used the Sirius wheat model to optimise drought tolerant ( DT) and drought sensitive ( DS) wheat ideotypes under future 2050 climate scenario at 13 contrasting sites , representing major wheat growing regions in Europe. Averaged over the sites , DT ideotypes achieved 13.4 % greater yield compared to DS , with the double yield stability for DT. However , the performances of the ideotypes were site dependent. Mean yield of DT was 28-37 % greater compared to DS in southern Europe. In contrast , no yield difference ( â‰¤ 1 %) between ideotypes was found in north-western Europe. An intermediate yield benefit of 10-23 % was found due to drought tolerance in central and eastern Europe. We conclude that tolerance to drought stress during reproductive development is important for high yield potentials and greater yield stability of wheat under climate change in Europe.
