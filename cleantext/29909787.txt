  This review aimed to critically analyse data pertaining to the clinical presentation and treatment of neuroendocrine carcinomas of the larynx. A PubMed search was performed using the term ` neuroendocrine carcinoma '. English-language articles on neuroendocrine carcinoma of the larynx were reviewed in detail.Results and conclusionWhile many historical classifications have been proposed , in contemporary practice these tumours are sub-classified into four subtypes: carcinoid , atypical carcinoid , small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. These tumours exhibit a wide range of biological behaviour , ranging from the extremely aggressive nature of small and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas , which usually have a fatal prognosis , to the less aggressive course of carcinoid tumours. In small and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas , a combination of irradiation and chemotherapy is indicated , while carcinoid and atypical carcinoid tumour management entails conservation surgery.
