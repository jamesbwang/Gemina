Four questionnaires , namely the SWBQ , SWBS , General Health Questionnaire ( GHQ-12) , and Oxford Happiness Questionnaire ( OHQ) , were used. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 18 and LISREL ( version 8.2). Cronbach 's alpha , intra-class correlation coefficient , Pearson correlation , and confirmatory factor analysis were employed to assess the validity and reliability of the questionnaires. Cronbach 's alpha for the SWBQ and the SWBS was greater than 0.85. The repeatability of both questionnaires was between 0.88 and 0.98. The Pearson correlation for the SWBQ and the SWBS ranged from 0.33 to 0.53; and all the correlations were significant. The respondents who indicated a higher spiritual well-being also reported better general health and happiness. The Persian versions of the SWBS and the SWBQ have good reliability , repeatability , and validity to assess spiritual health in the Iranian population.
