  Protein expression level is critically related to the cell physiological function. However , current methodologies such as Western blot ( WB) and Immunohistochemistry ( IHC) in analyzing the protein level are rather semi-quantitative and without the information of actual protein concentration. We have developed a microfluidic technique termed a `` flow-proteometric platform for analyzing protein concentration ( FAP) '' that can measure the concentration of a target protein in cells or tissues without the requirement of a calibration standard , e.g. , the purified target molecules. To validate our method , we tested a number of control samples with known target protein concentrations and showed that the FAP measurement resulted in concentrations that well matched the actual concentrations in the control samples ( coefficient of determination ( R
