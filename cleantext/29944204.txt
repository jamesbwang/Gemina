  An improved sol-gel process involving the use of hollow silica microspheres as a supporting additive was applied for the co-immobilization of whole cells of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> with Chromobacterium<pathogen> violaceum<pathogen> Ï‰-transaminase activity and Lodderomyces elongisporus with ketoreductase activity. The co-immobilized cells with two different biocatalytic activities could perform a cascade of reactions to convert racemic 4-phenylbutan-2-amine or heptan-2-amine into a nearly equimolar mixture of the corresponding enantiomerically pure R amine and S alcohol even in continuous-flow mode. The novel co-immobilized whole-cell system proved to be an easy-to-store and durable biocatalyst.
