  No studies have employed the EuroQoL ( EQ-5D) questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) in pemphigus patients , to date. To evaluate HRQoL of pemphigus patients by the EQ-5D and to analyse the convergent and known-groups validity of the EQ-5D in this patient population. Between 2014 and 2017 , a multicentre cross-sectional study was carried out. Outcome measures included the five-level EQ-5D ( EQ-5D-5L) , Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI) , Autoimmune Bullous Skin Disorder Intensity Score ( ABSIS) and an average pain intensity visual analogue scale ( VAS) for the past three months. 109 consecutive patients with pemphigus participated in the study ( mean age 57 years; women 64 %). Among the EQ-5D dimensions , the most problems were reported regarding pain/discomfort ( 50 %) , mobility ( 43 %) and anxiety/depression ( 43 %). No significant difference was found in mean EQ-5D index scores between patients with pemphigus vulgaris<pathogen> and foliaceus ( 0.81 vs. 0.86; p = 0.142). Mean EQ-5D index scores of patients with limited , moderate , significant and extreme pemphigus were 0.88 , 0.82 , 0.72 and 0.67 , respectively ( p = 0.001). The number of comorbidities was associated with greater impairment in EQ-5D index scores ( p < 0.001). DLQI ( r This is the first study employing the EQ-5D questionnaire in pemphigus. The EQ-5D is a valid measure of HRQoL in pemphigus patients that can be useful both in clinical practice and in economic evaluations to assess the health gains associated with new effective treatments.
