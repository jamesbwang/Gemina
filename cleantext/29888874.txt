  Increasing the productivity of crops is a major challenge in agricultural research. Given that photosynthetic carbon assimilation is necessary for plant growth , enhancing the efficiency of photosynthesis is one strategy to boost agricultural productivity. The authors attempted to increase the photosynthetic efficiency and biomass of tobacco plants by expressing individual components of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii carbon concentration mechanism ( CCM) and integrating them into the chloroplast. Independent transgenic varieties are generated accumulating the carbonic anhydrase CAH3 in the thylakoid lumen or the bicarbonate transporter LCIA in the inner chloroplast membrane. Independent homozygous transgenic lines showed enhanced CO
