  Parkinson 's Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder attributed to death of mesencephalic dopaminergic ( DA) neurons. Pluripotent stem cells have great potential in the study for this late-onset disease , but acquirement of cells that are robust in quantity and quality is still technically demanding. Biophysical cues have been shown to direct stem cell fate , but the effect of different topographies in the lineage commitment and subsequent maturation stages of cells have been less examined. Using human induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs) , we applied topographical patterns sequentially during differentiation stages and examined their ability to influence derivation yield and functionality of regionalized subtype-specific DA neurons. Gratings showed higher yield of DA neurons and may be beneficial for initial lineage commitment. Cells derived on pillars in the terminal differentiation stage have increased neuronal complexity , and were more capable of firing repetitive action potentials , showing that pillars yielded better network formation and functionality. Our topography platform can be applied to patient-derived iPSCs as well , and that cells harbouring LRRK2 mutation were more functionally mature when optimal topographies were applied sequentially. This will hopefully accelerate development of robust cell models that will provide novel insights into discovering new therapeutic approaches for Parkinson 's Disease.
