  Endogenous hydrogen sulfide plays an important role in various physiological and pathological processes and the convenient and selective recognition of hydrogen sulfide has become a research hotspot. We designed and synthesized a tetrahydro ( 5) helicene and 2,4-dinitrobenzene conjugate ( HD-DNP) as an effective fluorescent probe for selective detection of H
