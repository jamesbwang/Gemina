  In 2013 , an Integrated Care Pathway ( ICP) for concurrent Major Depressive ( MDD) and Alcohol Use ( AUD) Disorders was developed at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health ( CAMH) , Toronto , Ontario , Canada. The ICP was further implemented at 8 other clinical sites across Ontario ( the DA VINCI Project) in 2015-2017. The goal of this study was to systematically describe and analyze the main clinical outcomes of the project. Data on a non-randomized cohort of patients receiving ICP-based treatment were collected prospectively at nine clinical sites in a variety of clinical settings. descriptive statistics , t-test , chi-square , ANOVA , generalized linear models. Two hundred forty-six patients were enrolled , 58.8 % males , mean age was 45.6 years , 170 patients received treatment at academic health centres ( AHC) , 49- at community hospitals ( CH) and 27- in family health teams ( FHT). There were no major differences in anamnestic parameters and depression<symptom> severity between the three settings , but there were differences in baseline drinking patterns between subgroups ( F = 4.271 , df = 2 , p = 0.015). Overall completion rate was 70.7 % with no significant variation between settings ( Ï‡ The study demonstrated that ICP is a feasible and effective treatment for concurrent AUD and MDD that delivers meaningful clinical improvement in a variety of settings. A randomized controlled study is needed to properly compare the treatment outcomes between ICP model and treatment as usual and to further explore the role of various factors on treatment outcomes.
