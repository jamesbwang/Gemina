  We investigated parasympathetic innervation abnormalities of the iris sphincter and ciliary muscles in chronic Chagas disease by measuring pupillary diameter and intraocular pressure. A group of 80 patients with Chagas disease was compared with 76 healthy individuals without chagasic infection. The following procedures were performed: pupillometry , hypersensitivity<disease> test to pilocarpine 0.125 % , intraocular pressure measurement ( IOP) , basal pupil diameter ( BPD) , absolute pupillary constriction amplitude ( ACA) , relative pupillary constriction amplitude ( RCA) and the presence of anisocoria. The prevalence of anisocoria was higher in chagasic patients ( p < 0.01). These patients had mean basal pupillary diameter , mean photopic pupillary diameter and mean value of absolute pupillary constriction amplitude significantly lower than non-chagasic ones ( p < 0.01 , mean difference -0.50 mm) , ( p = 0.02 , mean difference -0.20 mm) , ( p < 0.01 , mean difference -0.29 mm) , respectively. The relative pupillary constriction amplitude did not differ between the two groups ( p = 0.39 , mean difference -1.15 %). There was hypersensitivity<disease> to dilute pilocarpine in 8 ( 10 %) of the chagasic patients in the right eye and in 2 ( 2.5 %) in the left eye and in 1 ( 1.25 %) in both eyes. The mean value of intraocular pressure had a marginal statistical significance between the two groups ( p = 0.06 , mean difference -0.91 mmHg). Patients with chagasic infection may exhibit ocular parasympathetic dysfunction , demonstrable by pupillometry and the dilute pilocarpine hypersensitivity<disease> test.
