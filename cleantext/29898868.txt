  The purpose of the study is to develop an optimal TR-Band weaning strategy while minimizing vascular access site complications of hematoma or radial artery occlusion ( RAO). The trial was a randomized , prospective , single center study of 129 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization via the radial artery. Group A was an accelerated protocol in which weaning was initiated 20 min after sheath removal. Group B was an adjusted protocol , in which weaning was dependent on the amount of anti-platelet or anti-coagulation used. All patients underwent radial artery ultrasound to demonstrate arterial patency. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups , and PCI was performed in 36.7 % of patients in Group A and 37.7 % of patients in Group B. RAO occurred in 7.7 % of patients overall , with no statistical difference between groups ( Group A 5 % versus Group B 10.1 % , p-value = 0.337). Hematoma formation > 5 cm in diameter occurred in 4.6 % of patients in the overall cohort , without statistical difference between groups ( Group A 5 % versus Group B 4.3 % , p-value = 1). The TR-Band duration was significantly shorter in Group A compared to Group B ( 112.9 ± 50.7 versus 130.7 ± 51.1 in minutes , respectively , p-value = 0.013). We have demonstrated an accelerated weaning protocol is simple to utilize for nursing staff without increased vascular site complications of RAO or hematoma formation.
