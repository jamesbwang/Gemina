  Some cardiac patients do not tolerate the intravenous fluid load commonly administered before anesthesia induction. This study investigated preinduction passive leg-raising maneuver ( PLRM) as an alternative method to fluid loading before cardiac anesthesia. During a 6-month period , 120 adult elective heart surgery patients were enrolled in this study and allocated into 2 groups: PLRM group vs control group ( n = 60). Anesthesia was induced using midazolam , fentanyl , and cisatracurium. Initially , 250 mL of fluid was administrated intravenously in all of patients before anesthesia induction. Then in the PLRM group , PLRM was performed starting 2 minutes before anesthesia induction and continued for 20 minutes after tracheal intubation. In the control group , anesthesia was induced in a simple supine position. Heart rate , invasive mean arterial blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( MAP) , and central venous pressure ( CVP) were recorded before PLRM , before anesthetic induction , before laryngoscopy , and at 5 , 10 , and 20 minutes after tracheal intubation. The hypotension<symptom> episode rate ( MAP < 70 mmHg) and CVP changes were compared between the 2 groups. The predictive value of the â‰¥ 3 mmHg increase in CVP value in response to PLRM for hypotension<symptom> prevention was defined. Hypotension<symptom> rates were lower in the PLRM group ( 63.3 % vs 81.6 %; Preinduction PLRM can provide a more stable hemodynamic status in adult cardiac surgery patients and decreases anesthesia-induced hypotension<symptom> rates by 62.50 %. Rate of the changes in the CVP value caused by PLRM is not predictive of subsequent MAP changes.
