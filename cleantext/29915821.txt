  The development of safe and effective nano-drug delivery systems to deliver anticancer drugs to targeted cells and organs is crucial to enhance the therapeutic efficacy and overcome unwanted side effects of chemotherapy. Herein , we prepared CD44-targeted dual-stimuli responsive human hair keratin and hyaluronic acid nanogels ( KHA-NGs) through a simple crosslinking method. KHA-NGs , which consisted of spheres 50 nm in diameter , were used as carriers to load the anticancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride ( DOX). The drug release , cellular uptake , cytotoxicity , and targeting ability of DOX-loaded KHA-NGs ( DOX@KHA-NGs) were assessed in vitro and the anticancer effects were further evaluated in vivo. The DOX@KHA-NGs had a super-high drug loading capacity ( 54.1 % , w/w) and were stable under physiological conditions ( 10 Î¼M glutathione ( GSH)) , with the drug being rapidly released under a tumor cell microenvironment of trypsin and 10 mM GSH. Cellular uptake and in vitro cytotoxicity results indicated that DOX@KHA-NGs specifically targeted cancer cells and effectively inhibited their growth. Furthermore , KHA-NGs were capable of improving intracellular nitric oxide levels , which sensitizes the cells and enhances the anticancer efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. In vivo experiments showed that DOX@KHA-NGs had a better anti-tumor effect and lower side effects compared to free DOX. These results suggest that the bio-responsive KHA-NGs have potential applications for targeted cancer therapy.
