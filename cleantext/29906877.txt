  The outer membrane protein channel EcChiP , associated with a silent gene in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , is a monomeric chitoporin. In a glucose-deficient environment , E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> can express the ChiP gene to exploit chitin degradation products. Single-channel small ion current measurements , which reveal the dynamics of single sugar molecules trapped in channel , are used here to study the exotic transport of chitosugars by E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. Molecules escape from the channel on multiple timescales. Voltage-dependent trapping rates observed for charged chitosan molecules , as well as model calculations , indicate that the rapid escape processes are those in which the molecule escapes back to the side of the membrane from which it originated. The probability that a sugar molecule is translocated through the membrane is thus estimated from the current data and the dependence of this translocation probability on the length of the chitosugar molecule and the applied voltage analyzed. The described method for obtaining the translocation probability and related molecular translocation current is applicable to other transport channels.
