  This study aimed to show that the physicochemical proprieties obtained by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR) , thermogravimetry ( TG) , and scanning electronic microscopy ( SEM) can be useful tools for evaluating the quality of active pharmaceutical ingredients ( APIs) and pharmaceutical products. In addition , a simple , sensitive , and efficient method employing HPLC-DAD was developed for simultaneous determination of lidocaine ( LID) , ciprofloxacin ( CFX) and enrofloxacin ( EFX) in raw materials and in veterinary pharmaceutical formulations. Compounds were separated using a Gemini C
