  DEP domain-containing mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR)- interacting protein ( DEPTOR) is an important modulator of mTOR , a kinase at the center of two important protein complexes named mTORC1 and mTORC2. These highly studied complexes play essential roles in regulating growth , metabolism , and immunity in response to mitogens , nutrients , and cytokines. Defects in mTOR signaling have been associated with the development of many diseases , including cancer and diabetes , and approaches aiming at modulating mTOR activity are envisioned as an attractive strategy to improve human health. DEPTOR interaction with mTOR represses its kinase activity and rewires the mTOR signaling pathway. Over the last years , several studies have revealed key roles for DEPTOR in numerous biological and pathological processes. Here , we provide the current state of the knowledge regarding the cellular and physiological functions of DEPTOR by focusing on its impact on the mTOR pathway and its role in promoting health and disease.
