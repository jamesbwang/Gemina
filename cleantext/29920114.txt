  Opsonins , an important arm of the innate immune system , are various soluble proteins , which play a critical role in destruction of invading pathogens directly or via engulfment of pathogens through the intermediate of phagocytosis. The diversity of opsonin profiles is under genetic influence and may be associated with variation in disease resistance. The aim of this study was to set up an assay to determine serum opsonophagocytic potential ( OPp) for chicken sera by flow cytometry and to evaluate the assay using samples from different chicken lines. Two chicken lines selected for high and low concentrations of mannose-binding lectin , a known opsonin , in serum were used to establish the method. Furthermore , the presumed `` robust '' Hellevad chickens and two other commercial chicken lines ( Hisex and Bovans) were tested to evaluate OPp as a parameter reflecting general immune competence. The results showed that Hellevad and Bovans chickens had higher OPp than Hisex chickens. There were no correlations between concentrations of total IgY or mannose-binding lectin and OPp. However , a strong positive correlation was observed between vaccine-induced infectious bronchitis<symptom> virus titres and OPp. Moreover , inverse relationships were observed between concentrations of total serum IgM as well as natural antibody levels , and OPp. In conclusion , in vitro opsonophagocytosis assessment and determination of OPp may be of relevance when addressing general innate immunocompetence. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS A flow cytometry method was developed to assess poultry serum opsonophagocytosis potential. This method is based on serum-opsonin-coated polystyrene beads and HD11 cell phagocytosis. Serum samples from different commercial chicken lines were compared. Opsonophagocytic potential may be included in assay panels for general immune competence of poultry.
