  To find the spectrum and frequency of lower gastrointestinal malignancies and diagnostic accuracy of colonoscopic brush cytology in their diagnosis. This was a prospective study carried out on 49 patients in the Department of Pathology over 1 year. Brushing material was smeared directly onto at least two clean glass slides. The air dried smears were stained with May Grunwald Giemsa stain. The endoscopic biopsies were examined grossly and were fixed in 10 % formalin , processed and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin stain , respectively. Special stains were used wherever required. The study was done on 49 patients presented with colorectal and anal lesions<symptom>. Age of the patients ranged from 17 to 72 years with male to female ratio being 1.57:1. On statistical analysis , the sensitivity of colonoscopic brush cytology was found to be 85.71 % and specificity 61.53 %. The accuracy came out to be 79.16 %. Brush cytology is a reliable , safe , inexpensive , and rapid method of diagnosing gastrointestinal lesions<symptom>. Since brushing is a relatively noninvasive procedure , routine use of brushings of colonoscopically visible lesions<symptom> should be done , in addition , to biopsy to increase the diagnostic yield.
