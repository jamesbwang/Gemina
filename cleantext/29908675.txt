  The effects of in vivo cocoa-based supplementation were studied as a preconditioning treatment for ex vivo acute oxidative conditions in a controlled randomized clinical trial. Subjects were 100 healthy young men at Universidad Industrial de Santander blinded to the intervention and divided into two groups: The intervention group ( n = 50) receiving 30 g of cocoa powder and 50 g of dark chocolate/d for 1 week with the remaining subjects receiving placebo. Cocoa products preconditioning for 1 week resulted in modifications in the susceptibility of plasma lipids over ex vivo oxidative conditions with effects of i) a significant increase in the oxidative resistance of plasma lipids measured by dienes formation ( 4.2 , CI: 0.18 , 8.2; P = 0.04) , and ii) a significant reduction in the production of toxic aldehydes as established by a decrease in the content of hexanal , quantified by gas chromatography ( -0.22 , CI: -0.38 , -0.05; P = 0.009). The in vivo cocoa-based preconditioning demonstrated protective properties against ex vivo oxidative modifications , improving total plasma lipids resistance to oxidation and protecting plasma lipids against great acute oxidative insult in comparison with placebo. This trial was registered at clinical clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01347450.
