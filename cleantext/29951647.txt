  The principle of near-infrared incoherent broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy was employed to develop a novel instrument for detecting natural gas leaks as well as for testing the quality of natural gas mixtures. The instrument utilizes the absorption features of methane , butane , ethane , and propane in the wavelength region of 1100 nm to 1250 nm. The absorption cross-section spectrum in this region for methane was adopted from the HITRAN database , and those for the other three gases were measured in the laboratory. A singular-value decomposition ( SVD) based analysis scheme was employed for quantifying methane , butane , ethane , and propane by performing a linear least-square fit. The developed instrument achieved a detection limit of 460 ppm , 141 ppm , 175 ppm and 173 ppm for methane , butane , ethane , and propane , respectively , with a measurement time of 1 second and a cavity length of 0.59 m. These detection limits are less than 1 % of the Lower<symptom> Explosive Limit ( LEL) for each gas. The sensitivity can be further enhanced by changing the experimental parameters ( such as cavity length , lamp power etc.) and using longer averaging intervals. The detection system is a low-cost and portable instrument suitable for performing field monitorings. The results obtained on the gas mixture emphasize the instrument 's potential for deployment at industrial facilities dealing with natural gas , where potential leaks pose a threat to public safety.
