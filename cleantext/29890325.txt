  We propose a method for constructing a spatio-temporal cortical surface atlas of neonatal brains aged between 36 and 44 weeks of post-menstrual age ( PMA) at the time of scan. The data were acquired as part of the Developing Human Connectome Project ( dHCP) , and the constructed surface atlases are publicly available. The method is based on a spherical registration approach: Multimodal Surface Matching ( MSM) , using cortical folding for driving the alignment. Templates have been generated for the anatomical cortical surface and for the cortical feature maps: sulcal depth , curvature , thickness , T1w/T2w myelin maps and cortical regions. To achieve this , cortical surfaces from 270 infants were first projected onto the sphere. Templates were then generated in two stages: first , a reference space was initialised via affine alignment to a group average adult template. Following this , templates were iteratively refined through repeated alignment of individuals to the template space until the variability of the average feature sets converged. Finally , bias towards the adult reference was removed by applying the inverse of the average affine transformations on the template and de-drifting the template. We used temporal adaptive kernel regression to produce age-dependant atlases for 9 weeks ( 36-44 weeks PMA). The generated templates capture expected patterns of cortical development including an increase in gyrification as well as an increase in thickness and T1w/T2w myelination with increasing age.
