  Radiosurgical treatments of brain tumors , vascular malformations , and functional disorders are more and more frequently used. Gamma Knife irradiation with the Icon system necessitates the use of a thermoplastic mask for head immobilization during treatment. Acute cutaneous allergy to thermoplastic masks has never been reported. A 71-year-old Caucasian woman treated radiosurgically for a sphenoidal meningioma using the Icon Gamma Knife system developed an acute allergic skin reaction to the thermoplastic mask used for head immobilization. Corticoids and antihistamine drugs were needed to continue the radiosurgical procedure to its end. Allergic reaction of the skin during radiosurgery with a thermoplastic mask for head fixation can develop due to cutaneous contact of the face with the mask.
