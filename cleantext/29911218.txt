  We propose a simple theoretical model describing the debonding process of soft adhesives in the probe-tack test. In this model , the expansion dynamics of interfacial cavities is determined by the balance<symptom> between the strain energy release rate and the rate-dependent fracture energy. As a result , we obtain analytical solutions for the cavity size , stress-strain curve , peak stress , strain at the peak stress , maximum strain , as well as the adhesion energy. Furthermore , we discuss the validity of our theoretical results by comparing them with experiments.
