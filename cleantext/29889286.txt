  The middle cranial fossa ( MCF) approach is a challenging surgical technique for the resection of small and intermediate sized , primarily intracanalicular , vestibular schwannomas ( VS) , with the goal of hearing preservation ( HP). To describe a decade-long , single institutional experience with the MCF approach for resection of VS. This is a retrospective cohort study of 63 patients who underwent the MCF approach for resection of VS from 2006 to 2016. Audiometric data included pure-tone average ( PTA) , low-tone pure-tone average ( LtPTA) , word recognition score , and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery ( AAO-HNS) hearing classification at presentation and follow-up. Patients with postoperative serviceable ( AAO-HNS class A-B) and/or useful ( AAO-HNS class A-C) hearing were compared to those without HP. Facial nerve function was assessed using the House-Brackmann scale. The mean age and duration of follow-up were 50 ± 13 yr and 21 ± 21 mo , respectively. The mean tumor size was 10 ± 4 mm. The serviceable and usable HP rates were 54 % and 50 % , respectively. Some residual hearing was preserved in 71 % of patients. Large tumor size ( P = .05) , volume ( P = .03) , and extrameatal tumor extension ( P = .03) were associated with poor audiometric outcomes. The presence of a fundal fluid cap ( P = .01) was a favorable finding. At definitive testing , LtPTA was significantly better preserved than traditional PTA ( P = .01). Facial nerve outcomes , tumor control rates , and durability of audiometric outcomes were excellent. 47 % of patients pursued aural rehabilitation. In our series , the MCF approach for VS provided excellent rates of tumor and facial nerve function , with durable serviceable HP.
