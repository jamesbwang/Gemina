  To determine the impact of obesity on development of portal vein thrombosis in cirrhotic patients. Cirrhosis is a known risk factor for portal vein thrombosis ( PVT). Evidence also points to obesity as being a risk factor for venous thromboembolism. Limited information is available on how obesity impacts the development of PVT in cirrhotic patients. This was a retrospective cohort study using the 2013 National Inpatient Sample. Patients older than 18 years with an ICD-9 CM code for any diagnosis of liver cirrhosis were included. There was no exclusion criteria. The primary outcome was the impact of obesity on development of PVT. Obesity was also sub-classified according to body-mass index ( BMI). Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality , ICU admission , shock<symptom> , TPN use , and resource utilization. Odds ratios ( OR) and means were adjusted for age , gender , and ethnicity. We included 69,934 obese cirrhotics of which , 1,125 developed PVT ( mean age 59 years , 35 % female). Overall in-hospital mortality rates were 9 % ( 11 % with PVT vs 5 % without PVT). On multivariate analysis , obesity was not associated with a significantly different adjusted OR for development of PVT compared to non-obese. When stratifying by obesity subtype , class 1 obesity was associated with increased odds of PVT ( OR: 1.45 , 95 % CI: 1.06-1.96 , p = 0.02) , while class 3 obesity was associated with a decreased odds of PVT ( OR: 0.72 , 95 % CI: 0.58-0.88 , p < 0.01) compared to non-obese. Obesity is not associated with increased odds of PVT.
