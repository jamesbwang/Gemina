  A hollow fibre membrane was fabricated by blending polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF) with a triblock copolymer additive polymer that has both hydrophilic and oleophobic surface properties. The novel membrane was characterized and examined for oil/water separation under various system conditions , including different cross-flow rate , feed temperature , trans-membrane pressure , and its rejection and cleaning efficiency , etc.. By applying the membrane into the filtration of synthesized oil/water emulsion , the membrane constantly achieved an oil rejection rate of above 99 % , with a relatively constant permeate flux varied in the range of 68.9-59.0 l m
