  The therapeutic education of patients and their close relations is , as yet , poorly developed in France in the field of oncology. Total laryngectomy is a mutilating surgical procedure having a major impact on the patient 's life , due to its physical and functional sequelae. Its psychosocial consequences are also important and alter the quality of life of patients and their close relations. Currently , care for laryngectomised patients consists essentially in informing and educating them on some technical procedures during hospital admission. The intervention of a speech therapist , often serves as the link between the patient and the hospital care team. These healthcare modalities often insufficiently account for the social , environmental and personal factors that interact in health-related problems. This report presents the therapeutic education programme protocol `` PETAL '' for laryngectomised patients and their close relations to improve their quality of life. The trial will be conducted over three phases: ( 1) the `` pilot '' phase aims at developing knowledge on the consequences of laryngectomy on the quality of life of patients and their close relations and developed a pluridisciplinary therapeutic education program , ( 2) the prospective intervention `` replication '' phase aims at evaluating the programme 's transferability in three centres and ( 3) the cluster-randomised multicentric comparative intervention phase , will assess the benefits of the developed programme. Phase I identified nine themes of workshops related to therapeutic education , training and coordination of care. The developed programme should reinforce town-hospital links to improve help , follow-up and support for patients and their close relations.
