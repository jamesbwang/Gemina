  This study evaluated the effect of the accelerated artificial aging ( AAA) on feldspar ceramic strength and the reinforcing effect promoted by adhesive cementation with resin luting agent. One hundred twenty feldspar ceramic disks were obtained. Sixty disks were acid-etched , silanized , and coated with an experimental resin luting agent simulating the adhesive luting procedures. Four groups were created ( n = 30): uncoated ceramic ( control group) , uncoated ceramic submitted to AAA , ceramic coated with resin luting agent , and coated ceramic submitted to AAA. Biaxial flexural testing with ball-on-ring setup was carried out. Biaxial flexural strength ( s bf , MPa) , characteristic strength ( s 0 , MPa) , and Weibull modulus ( m) were calculated for axial positions z = 0 ( ceramic surface) and z =- t2 ( luting agent surface). Data of s bf at positions z = 0 and z =- t2 were separately submitted to statistical analyses ( a = 0.05). The uncoated ceramic submitted to AAA had no significant difference in s bf and s 0 compared with the control group. Resin coating of the ceramic increased s bf and s 0 at z = 0. The AAA increased the s bf and s 0 for the resin-coated ceramic specimens at z = 0 and also the s 0 at axial position z =- t2. The structural reliability at z = 0 and z =- t2 was not influenced by the variables tested. In conclusion , resin coating improved the mechanical strength of the feldspar ceramic. The AAA procedure was not effective in aging the uncoated or resin-coated feldspar ceramic specimens.
