  LncRNA H19 is involved in the development of multiple cancers. Here , we firstly provide new evidence that H19 can induce LIN28B , a conserved RNA binding protein , to accelerate lung cancer growth through sponging miR-196b. Abundance in LIN28B was observed in clinical lung cancer samples. A positive link was observed between H19 and LIN28B in clinical lung cancer samples. In lung cancer cells , H19 was capable of increasing LIN28B expression. Mechanistically , miR-196b directly targeted LIN28B to inhibit LIN28B expression. H19 was capable of promoting LIN28B expression through sequestering miR-196b. Functionally , H19-increased LIN28B conferred the cell proliferation of lung cancer. Our finding indicates that H19 depresses miR-196b to elevate LIN28B , resulting in accelerating cell proliferation in lung cancer.
