  Recently , dozens of new psychoactive substances have appeared on the European drug market every year. The most abundant group of these compounds is synthetic cannabinoids. In the first few years of the `` legal highs '' phenomenon , JWH ( John W. Huffman) compounds were especially popular among drug users. However , the group of synthetic cannabinoids is constantly expanding , as new compounds are created by replacing known structural elements with different chemical groups. The problem with the identification of novel substances in forensic laboratories results from the structural similarity of the compounds and the rapid introduction of newer designer drugs on the black market. In this study , the fragmentation patterns of 29 new-type synthetic cannabinoids using electrospray ionization were investigated. The analysis was performed using quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Based on measurements carried out under various conditions , the way of fragmentation of the tested compounds that were divided into groups due to their chemical structure was established. The study showed that the bond between the carbon atom of the carbonyl group and the ring or NH group attached to the ring was mainly cleaved. This mechanism was adequate for the fragmentation of first-generation synthetic cannabinoids. This paper presents characteristic ions formed by synthetic cannabinoids ( i.e. , ions originating from an indole/indazole ring and an adamanyl/naphthalene/quinoline ring) using electrospray ionization. Knowledge of these specific fragments can be used in forensic laboratories to determine the structure of novel compounds from the group of synthetic cannabinoids. Graphical Abstract á…Ÿ.
