  Joint<symptom> pain<symptom> may be an early indicator of biomechanical stress. During adolescence the physical development , including the development of the musculoskeletal system , is still ongoing and joint<symptom> pain<symptom> requires special attention , especially among young athletes. Young athletes from the highest national basketball leagues in Germany were questioned about prevalence , location , context and coping strategies concerning joint<symptom> pain<symptom>. Data were derived from the German `` Adolescents ' and Childrens ' Health in Elite Basketball study '' ( ACHE study). Analyses were based on an online survey of 182 elite basketball players between 13 and 19 years of age from 46 German teams , conducted between April 2016 and June 2016. In the highest German leagues 2 out of 3 players suffered from joint<symptom> pain<symptom> at the time of the survey ( 7-day prevalence 64.6 %). Pain in the lower extremities occurred most frequently. The 7â€‘day prevalence for knee and leg<symptom> pain<symptom> reached up to 40 % and foot pain up to 21 %. For 84 % of all players , occasional consumption of analgesics was the norm and 40 % took them frequently. The consumption of several medicinal substances , especially of cyclooxygenase inhibitors , such as ibuprofen and diclofenac , is widespread among adolescent elite basketball players as 1 out of 7 athletes ( 13 %) used medicinal substances despite being pain-free and 5 % used it prophylactically with the purpose of preventing pain. From the point of view of pain medicine , it is not only the high prevalence of pain that is remarkable but also the widespread use of analgesics without a prescription and the misguided conception of adolescent competitive athletes that such medications have preventive effects.
