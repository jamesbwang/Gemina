  Although simulation training has been utilized quite extensively in highincome medical environments , its feasibility and effect on team performance in lowresource pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit ( CICU) environments has not been demonstrated. We hypothesized that lowfidelity simulationbased crisis resource management training would lead to improvements in team performance in such settings. In this prospective observational study , the effect of simulation on team dynamics and performance was assessed in 23 healthcare providers in a pediatric CICU in Southeast Asia. A 5day training program was utilized consisting of various didactic sessions and simulation training exercises. Improvements in team dynamics were assessed using participant questionnaires , expert evaluations , and video analysis of time to intervention and frequency of closedloop communication. In subjective questionnaires , participants noted significant ( This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of simulationbased training in improving team dynamics and performance in lowresource pediatric CICU environments , indicating its potential role in eliminating communication barriers in these settings.
