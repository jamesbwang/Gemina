  To perform a review on the latest evidence related to normal and pathological intrarenal pressures ( IRPs) , complications of incremented values , and IRP ranges during endourology. A literature search was performed using PubMed , restricted to original English-written articles , including animal , artificial model , and human studies. Different keywords were: percutaneous nephrolithotomy , PCNL , ureteroscopy , URS , RIRS , irrigation flow , irrigation pressure , intrarenal pressure , intrapelvic pressure and renal pelvic pressure. Normal IRPs range from zero to a few cm H IRP increase remains a neglected predictor of upper tract endourology complications and its intraoperative monitoring should be taken into consideration. Further research is necessary , to quantify pressures generated during upper tract endourology , and introduce means of controlling them.
