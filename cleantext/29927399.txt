  To assess the changes in several biomarkers in patients with atherosclerosis of brachiocephalic arteries and shape a biomarker profile of cerebral atherosclerosis as an integrative index. The study included 124 patients with atherosclerotic lesions<symptom> of internal carotid arteries ( 82 men and 42 women) aged from 37 to 73 years. The patients were stratified by history of prior stroke into ` asymptomatic ' and ` symptomatic '. Along with general clinical and neurological examinations , ultrasound analysis of brachiocephalic arteries , neuroimaging , identification of biomarkers reflecting different stages of atherogenesis and evaluation of pathomorphological parameters of atherosclerotic plaques removed during carotid endarterectomy surgery were performed. Concentrations of NO Together with other diagnostic methods , identification of biomarkers can increase the accuracy of prognosis and prevention of sudden cardiovascular death. The authors have developed a scale of biomarker ` burdeness ' of the patient with cerebral atherosclerosis that may be a first step to individualized prevention of associated ischemic complications.
