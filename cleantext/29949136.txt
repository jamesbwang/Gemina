  To explore the role of microRNA-409 in spinal cord injury ( SCI) recovery and its underlying mechanism. The mouse SCI model was first established , and the difference in recovery of grip strength was detected. MicroRNA-409 expressions in mice tissues from sham operation group and SCI group were detected by quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction ( qRT-PCR). We further increased microRNA-409 level in mice spinal cord by plasmids transfection. Luciferase activity was detected to verify the direct binding of microRNA-409 and ZNF366. The grip strength in both groups was temporarily decreased after surgery , while the grip strength in SCI group was always remarkably lower than that of the sham operation group since the first week after the surgery , suggesting the successful construction of mouse SCI model. MicroRNA-409 expression in the SCI group was gradually decreased from the postoperative 3rd day , which was remarkably lower than that of the sham group. Additionally , ZNF366 expression in the SCI group began to increase from the first day after the surgery , which was markedly higher than that of the sham group. After injection of exogenous microRNA-409 , ZNF366 expression in the SCI group showed a remarkable decrease compared to that of the sham operation group. We also confirmed that ZNF366 was the target gene of microRNA-409 by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase activity assay. MicroRNA-409 is downregulated after spinal cord injury. Overexpression of microRNA-409 directly targets ZNF366 and promotes the recovery of spinal cord injury.
