  In this study , a stepwise cluster modeling approach ( SCMA) is developed for analyzing urban ecosystem variation via Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( NDVI). NDVI is an indicator of vegetation growth and coverage and useful in reflecting urban ecosystem. SCMA is established on a cluster tree that can characterize the complex relationship between independent and dependent variables. SCMA is applied to the City of Dongguan for simulating the urban NDVI and identifying associated drivers of human activity , topography and meteorology without specific functions. Results show that SCMA performances better than conventional statistical methods , illustrating the ability of SCMA in capturing the complex and nonlinear features of urban ecosystem. Results disclose that human activities play negative effects on NDVI due to the destruction of green space for pursuing more space for buildings. NDVI reduces gradually from the south part to the north part of Dongguan due to increased gross domestic product and population density , indicating that the ecosystem in Dongguan is better in the south part. NDVI in the northeast part ( dominated by agriculture) is sensitive to the growth of economy and population. More attention should be paid to this part for sustainable development , such as increasing afforestation , planting grass and constructing parks. Precipitation has a positive effect on NDVI due to the promotion of soil moisture that is beneficial to plants ' growth. Awareness of these complexities is helpful for sustainable development of urban ecosystem.
