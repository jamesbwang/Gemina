  Visibility algorithms are a family of methods that map time series into graphs , such that the tools of graph theory and network science can be used for the characterization of time series. This approach has proved a convenient tool , and visibility graphs have found applications across several disciplines. Recently , an approach has been proposed to extend this framework to multivariate time series , allowing a novel way to describe collective dynamics. Here we test their application to fMRI time series , following two main motivations , namely that ( a) this approach allows vs to simultaneously capture and process relevant aspects of both local and global dynamics in an easy and intuitive way , and ( b) this provides a suggestive bridge between time series and network theory that nicely fits the consolidating field of network neuroscience. Our application to a large open dataset reveals differences in the similarities of temporal networks ( and thus in correlated dynamics) across resting-state networks , and gives indications that some differences in brain activity connected to psychiatric disorders could be picked up by this approach.
