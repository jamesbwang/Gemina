  We investigated the hypocholesterolemic and liver-protective effects of cooked and germinated whole mung beans. Hamsters were fed for 28 days on diets rich in saturated fatty acids and cholesterol , differing only in protein source ( 20 %): casein , cooked whole mung bean , and germinated mung bean. After 28 days , we found reduced plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol , increased faecal cholesterol excretion , and reduced levels of asparagine aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase enzymes in the liver. Reduction in hepatic lipid deposition was observed between each of the mung bean groups relative to the casein group. In addition , the animals of the geminated mung bean group showed a lack of inflammatory infiltrate and better vascularisation of the hepatic tissue. Results from this study show significant hypocholesterolemic and liver-protective properties of the mung bean , which are further enhanced after germination.
