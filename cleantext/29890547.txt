  Neonatal diabetes mellitus is likely caused by monogenic mutations , several of which have been identified. INS mutations have a broad spectrum of clinical presentations , ranging from severe neonatal onset to mild adult onset , which suggests that the products of different mutant INS alleles behave differently and utilize distinct mechanisms to induce diabetes. In this study , a neonatal diabetes mellitus patient 's INS gene was sequenced , and functional experiments were conducted. The neonatal diabetes mellitus patient 's genomic DNA was extracted , and the patient 's KCNJ11 , ABCC8 , and INS genes were sequenced. A novel mutation was identified in INS , and the open reading frame of this human mutant INS gene was inserted into the pMSCV-PIG plasmid. The constructed pMSCV-PIG plasmid was combined with VSV-g and Gag-pol and transfected into 293T cells to package the lentivirus. To stably overexpress the mutant gene , INS-1 cells were infected with the virus. The levels of insulin in the cell culture medium and cytoplasm were determined by ELISA and immunocytochemistry , respectively. A heterozygous mutation , c. 125T > G ( p. Val42Gly) , was identified in a neonatal diabetes mellitus patient 's INS gene. The human mutant INS open reading frame was overexpressed in INS-1 cells , and the mutant insulin was undetectable in the cell culture medium and cytoplasm. The novel heterozygous activating mutation c. 125 T > G ( p.Val42Gly) impairs the synthesis of insulin by pancreatic beta cells , resulting in diabetes.
