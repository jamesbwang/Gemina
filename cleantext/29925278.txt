  Interleukin-6 ( IL-6) is well-known for its pro-inflammatory properties , has been proven to target a wide range of cells in the joint , and has been implicated in extra-articular and articular manifestations in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA). Tocilizumab ( TCZ) is now widely used in patients with active RA and a number of additional agents that target the IL-6 pathways are under development , including sirukumab ( SRK). Areas covered: SRK is an IgG1Îº human anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody which binds to IL-6 and prevents IL-6-mediated downstream effects. Initial trial results in phase-III studies in patients with RA seemed promising , showing improved results in patients with moderate-to-severe RA. Data derive from the phase-II study and the various SIRROUND studies ( phase III). Expert commentary: The available data show that SRK50 mg every 4 weeks or 100 mg every 2 weeks will be effective in treating the RA population , with clinical improvements as early as week 2 and sustained over time. The adverse-event profile seems to be similar to TCZ , except for an increased mortality post open-label studies due to infections and cardiovascular events , our knowledge of which will be deepened with post-marketing surveillance and registry data.
