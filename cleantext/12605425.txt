  The aim of this A total of forty patients with infected root canals were selected. The root canals were prepared mechanically , and irrigation was done with 3 % sodium hypochlorite ( NaOCl). Microbiological samples were collected before LASER treatment with the help of the master apical file ( MAF) to full working length for subsequent microbiological examination. The procedure was followed by laser treatment with an EZLASE diode LASER ( 940 nm) , at different output powers. Following irradiation , samples were collected for microbiological examination. The samples were transferred to an agar plate and incubated for 48 h at 37 Â°C. The colonies formed were then counted , and the total number of bacteria per ml before and after LASER application was assessed. Colony-forming unit ( CFU/ml) was counted for The highest power of laser used ( 1.95 W) had resulted in maximum reduction of bacterial flora and Combination therapy consisting of irrigation using NaOCl and LASER irradiation , especially at high output power was an effective treatment option for a reduction in
