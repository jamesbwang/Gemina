  Tubal sterilization with Essure inserts has become a prevalent alternative to laparoscopic sterilization because of its minimal invasiveness. It is a well-tolerated ambulatory procedure that provides reliable permanent contraception without the risks associated with laparoscopic surgery and general anesthesia. Correct positioning of the Essure device is necessary to achieve the fibrotic reaction induced by the polyethylene terephthalate fibers , subsequently resulting in tubal occlusion usually within 3 months. After uneventful procedures with satisfactory bilateral placement , only the correct position of the devices needs to be confirmed at follow-up. The imaging techniques used to asses Essure devices may vary depending on the country and its recommendations. The gold-standard test to ascertain tubal occlusion remains the hysterosalpingography but after uneventful procedures , vaginal-ultrasound proved to be a reliable alternative to confirm the proper position of the inserts. Radiologists have been increasingly confronted to post-procedural evaluations and despite the efficiency rate of the Essure device , its use still exposes to a low risk of complications and malfunctions such as unwanted pregnancies , device misplacement , tubal or uterine perforation , and chronic pelvic pain. Unintended pregnancies are mostly due to patient or physician non-compliance and misinterpretation of post-procedural examinations by radiologists which emphasizes the importance of their training in Essure device assessment. This pictorial review discusses the imaging methods used to asses Essure implants and illustrates the possible complications related to them.
