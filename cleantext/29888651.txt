  With the advent of personalized medicine , clinical trials studying treatment effects in subpopulations are receiving increasing attention. The objectives of such studies are , besides demonstrating a treatment effect in the overall population , to identify subpopulations , based on biomarkers , where the treatment has a beneficial effect. Continuous biomarkers are often dichotomized using a threshold to define two subpopulations with low and high biomarker levels. If there is insufficient information on the dependence structure of the outcome on the biomarker , several thresholds may be investigated. The nested structure of such subpopulations is similar to the structure in group sequential trials. Therefore , it has been proposed to use the corresponding critical boundaries to test such nested subpopulations. We show that for biomarkers with a prognostic effect that is not adjusted for in the statistical model , the variability of the outcome may vary across subpopulations which may lead to an inflation of the family-wise type 1 error rate. Using simulations we quantify the potential inflation of testing procedures based on group sequential designs. Furthermore , alternative hypotheses tests that control the family-wise type 1 error rate under minimal assumptions are proposed. The methodological approaches are illustrated by a trial in
