  Polymicrobial sepsis<disease> ( after cecal ligation and puncture , CLP) causes robust complement activation with release of C5a. Many adverse events develop thereafter and will be discussed in this review article. Activation of complement system results in generation of C5a which interacts with its receptors ( C5aR1 , C5aR2). This leads to a series of harmful events , some of which are connected to the cardiomyopathy of sepsis<disease> , resulting in defective action potentials in cardiomyocytes ( CMs) , activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in CMs and the appearance of extracellular histones , likely arising from activated neutrophils which form neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs). These events are associated with activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs) in CMs. The ensuing release of histones results in defective action potentials in CMs and reduced levels of ( Ca
