  Facebook has become the most popular social networking site with more than 2.07 billion monthly active users. However , this popularity has its pains<symptom> too reflected by some addictive behavior among its users. Although researchers have recently started to examine the factors that influence Facebook addiction , little research examined the links between motives for Facebook use and Facebook addiction. These studies mainly concentrate on students too. Also , little research has explored this issue among general public in general and among people in Jordan in particular. This study therefore examined the impact of motives for Facebook use on Facebook addiction among ordinary users in Jordan. A sample of 397 ordinary users is employed to achieve the study objective. Results showed that 38.5 % of the participants were addicted to Facebook. Facebook addiction was significantly associated with six motives , namely exhibitionism and companionship , entertainment , escapism and passing time , social curiosity , relationships formation and relationships maintenance. Among these six motives , escapism and passing time , exhibitionism and companionship , and relationships maintenance were the strong predictors of Facebook addiction.
