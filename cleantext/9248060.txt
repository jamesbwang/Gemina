  To discuss the impact of intraocular lens- ( IOL)- power , IOL-thickness , IOL-shape , corneal power and effective lens position ( ELP) on the distance between the anterior IOL vertex ( ALP) of a thick IOL and the ELP of its thin lens equivalent. We calculated the ALP of a thick IOL in a model eye , which results in the same focal plane as a thin IOL placed at the ELP using paraxial approximation. The model eye included IOL-power ( P) , ELP , IOL-thickness ( Th) , IOL-shape-factor ( X) , and corneal power ( DC). The initial values were P = 10 D ( diopter: 1 D = 1 m-1) , 20 D , 30 D , Th = 0.9 mm , ELP = 5 mm , X = 0 , DC = 43 D. The difference between ALP and the ELP was illustrated as a function of each of the model parameters. The ALP of a thick lens has to be placed in front of the ELP for P > 0 IOLs to achieve the same optical effect as the thin lens equivalent. The difference ALP-ELP for the initial values is -0.57 mm. Minus power IOLs ( ALP-ELP = -0.07 mm , for IOL-power = -5 D) and convex-concave IOLs ( ALP-ELP = -0.16 mm , for X = 1) have to be placed further posterior. The corneal power and ELP have less influence , but corneal power can not be neglected. The distance between ELP and ALP primarily depends on IOL-power , IOL-thickness , and shape-factor.
