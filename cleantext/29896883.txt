  Although MEK blockade has been highlighted as a promising antitumor drug , it has poor clinical efficacy in KRAS mutant colorectal cancer ( CRC). Several feedback systems have been described in which inhibition of one intracellular pathway leads to activation of a parallel signaling pathway , thereby decreasing the effectiveness of single-MEK targeted therapies. Here , we investigated a bypass mechanism of resistance to MEK inhibition in KRAS CRC. We found that KRAS mutant CRC cells with refametinib , MEK inhibitor , induced MIF secretion and resulted in activation of STAT3 and MAPK. MIF knockdown by siRNA restored sensitivity to refametinib in KRAS mutant cells. In addition , combination with refametinib and 4-IPP , a MIF inhibitor , effectively reduced the activity of STAT3 and MAPK , more than single-agent treatment. As a result , combined therapy was found to exhibit a synergistic growth inhibitory effect against refametinib-resistant cells by inhibition of MIF activation. These results reveal that MIF-induced STAT3 and MAPK activation evoked an intrinsic resistance to refametinib. Our results provide the basis for a rational combination strategy against KRAS mutant colorectal cancers , predicated on the understanding of cross talk between the MEK and MIF pathways.
