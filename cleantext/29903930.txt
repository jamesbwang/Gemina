  Though currently approved for visual assessment only , there is evidence to suggest that quantification of amyloid-β ( Aβ) PET images may reduce inter-reader variability and aid in the monitoring of treatment effects in clinical trials. Quantification typically involves a regional atlas in standard space , requiring PET images to be spatially normalized. Different uptake patterns in Aβ-positive and Aβ-negative subjects , however , makes spatial normalization challenging. In this study we propose a method to spatially normalize (
