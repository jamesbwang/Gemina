  GPCR kinase 2-interacting protein-1 ( GIT1) is a scaffold protein that plays an important role in cell adaptation , proliferation , migration , and differentiation; however , the role of GIT1 in the regulation of neuronal death after spinal cord injury remains obscure. Here , we demonstrate that GIT1 deficiency remarkably increased neuronal apoptosis and enhanced JNK/p38 signaling , which resulted in stronger motor deficits by ischemia-reperfusion in vivo , consistent with the finding of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced neuronal injury in vitro. After treatment with JNK and p38 inhibitors , abnormally necroptotic cell death caused by GIT1 knockdown could be partially rescued , with the recovery of neuronal viability , which was still poorer than that in control neurons. Meanwhile , overactivation of JNK/p38 after GIT1 depletion was concomitant with excessive activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 ( ASK1) that could be abolished by ASK1 silencing in HEK293T cells. Finally , GIT1 could disrupt the oligomerization of ASK1 via interaction between the synaptic localization domain that contains the coiled-coil ( CC) -2 domain of GIT1 and the C-terminal CC domain of ASK1. It suppressed the autophosphorylation of ASK1 and led to decreasing activity of the ASK1/JNK/p38 pathway. These data reveal a protective role for GIT1 in neuronal damage by modulating ASK1/JNK/p38 signaling.-Chen , J. , Wang , Q. , Zhou , W. , Zhou , Z. , Tang , P.-Y. , Xu , T. , Liu , W. , Li , L.-W. , Cheng , L. , Zhou , Z.-M. , Fan , J. , Yin , G.-Y.
