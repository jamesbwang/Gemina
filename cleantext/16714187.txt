  Platelets are essential for clotting in the blood and maintenance of normal hemostasis. Under pathologic conditions such as atherosclerosis , vascular injury often results in hyperactive platelet activation , resulting in occlusive thrombus formation , myocardial infarction , and stroke. Recent work in the field has elucidated a number of platelet functions unique from that of maintaining hemostasis , including regulation of tumor growth and metastasis , inflammation<symptom> , infection , and immune response. Traditional therapeutic targets for inhibiting platelet activation have primarily been limited to cyclooxygenase-1 , integrin
