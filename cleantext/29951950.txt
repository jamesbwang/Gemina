  The Psychopharmacotherapy-Structured Clinical Observation ( P-SCO) is a direct observation tool designed to assess resident performance of a medication visit. This study examines two dimensions of validity for the P-SCO: internal structure and how scores correlate with another variable associated with competence ( experience). The faculty completed 601 P-SCOs over 4 years. Multilevel exploratory factor analysis was performed with minimum thresholds for eigenvalue ( ≥ 1.0) and proportion of variance explained ( ≥ 5.0 %). Internal reliability was assessed with Cronbach alpha. To examine how scores changed with experience , mean ratings ( 1-4 scale) were calculated for each factor by quarter of the academic year. Separate linear mixed models were also performed. The analysis yielded three factors that explained 50 % of the variance and demonstrated high internal reliability: affective tasks ( alpha = 0.90) , cognitive tasks ( alpha = 0.84) , and hard tasks ( alpha = 0.74). Items within `` hard tasks '' were assessment of substance use , violence risk , and adherence , and inquiry about interactions with other providers. Monitoring adverse effects did not load on the hard task factor but also had overall low mean ratings. Compared to the first quarter , fourth quarter scores for affective tasks ( b = 0.54 , p < 0.01) and hard tasks ( b = 0.46 , p = 0.02) were significantly improved while cognitive tasks had a non-significant increase. For the hard tasks , the proportion of residents with a low mean rating improved but was still over 30 % during the fourth quarter. The results provide evidence for the validity of the P-SCO with respect to its internal structure and how scores correlate with experience. Curricular implications are explored , especially for the tasks that were hard to learn.
