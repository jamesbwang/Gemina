  Environmental genotoxicity in the Gulf of Riga was assessed using different bioindicators ( fish , clams , and isopods) collected from 14 study stations. Comparison of genotoxicity responses ( micronuclei ( MN) and nuclear buds ( NB)) in blood erythrocytes of herring ( Clupea harengus) , eelpout ( Zoarces viviparous) , and flounder ( Platichthys flesus) revealed the species- and site-specific differences. For the first time , the analysis of genotoxicity was carried out in gill cells of isopods Saduria entomon. The highest inductions of MN and NB in gill cells of investigated S. entomon and clams ( Macoma balthica) were evaluated in specimens from station 111A ( offshore zone). In fish , the highest incidences of MN were measured in eelpout and in herring collected in the southern part of Gulf of Riga ( station GOR3/41S). Moreover , in the southern coastal area , the assessment of genotoxicity risk ( according to micronuclei levels) indicated exceptionally high risk for flounder , eelpout , and clams.
