  Ethylene regulates climacteric fruit ripening , and EIN3-LIKE1 ( EIL1) plays an important role in this process. In apple ( Malus domestica) , fruit coloration is accompanied by ethylene release during fruit ripening , but the molecular mechanism that underlies these two physiological processes is unknown. In this study , we found that ethylene treatment markedly induced fruit coloration as well as the expression of MdMYB1 , a positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit coloration. In addition , we found that MdEIL1 directly bound to the promoter of MdMYB1 and transcriptionally activated its expression , which resulted in anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit coloration. Furthermore , MdMYB1 interacted with the promoter of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3 ( MdERF3) , a key regulator of ethylene biosynthesis , thereby providing a positive feedback for ethylene biosynthesis regulation. Overall , our findings provide insight into a mechanism involving the synergistic interaction of the ethylene signal with the MdMYB1 transcription factor to regulate ethylene biosynthesis and fruit coloration in apple.
