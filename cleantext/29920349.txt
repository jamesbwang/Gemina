  Recent trials established the efficacy of mechanical stent-retriever thrombectomy for treatment of stroke patients with large vessel occlusion ( LVO) in the anterior circulation. However , stent-retriever thrombectomy may not accomplish successful recanalization in all patients. The aim of this study is to report the role of bail-out permanent stenting after failure of mechanical thrombectomy. Among 430 patients included in a prospectively maintained database , we analysed 325 cases of anterior circulation LVO. Mechanical thrombectomy ( mTICI 2b-3) was effective in 213/325 ( 65 %) and failed in 112/325 ( 35 %). Bail-out intracranial stenting was performed in 17/325 ( 5.2 %) patients. In all cases a fully retrievable detachable stent was used ( Solitaire AB , Medtronic). No intraprocedural technical complications occurred. Successful reperfusion ( mTICI 2b/3) was achieved in 12/17 patients ( 70.6 %). Three ( 17.6 %) patients died: one extensive infarction in the internal carotid artery territory , one large intracerebral haemorrhage , and one massive pulmonary embolism. Haemorrhagic conversion , both symptomatic and asymptomatic , occurred in 2/17 ( 11.7 %). Good clinical outcome ( mRS 0-2) at 3-months was achieved in 41.2 % of patients. Bail-out intracranial stenting after unsuccessful thrombectomy is technically feasible and the associated haemorrhagic risk seems acceptable in selected patients. We suggest that bail-out intracranial stenting , is safe and effective in selected patients with LVO stroke who failed to respond to thrombectomy.
