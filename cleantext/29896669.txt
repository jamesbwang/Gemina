  Upon infection and depending on the infected cell type , human<pathogen> herpesvirus<pathogen> 6A ( HHV-6A) and 6B ( HHV-6B) can replicate or enter a state of latency. HHV-6A and HHV-6B can integrate their genomes into host chromosomes as one way to establish latency. Viral integration takes place near the subtelomeric/telomeric junction of chromosomes. When HHV-6 infection and integration occur in gametes , the virus can be genetically transmitted. Inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 ( iciHHV-6)- positive individuals carry one integrated HHV-6 copy per somatic cell. The prevalence of iciHHV-6
