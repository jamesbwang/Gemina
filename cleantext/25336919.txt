  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death after prostate cancer for males and breast cancer for females. There are novel therapies in the past five years such as; tyrosine kinase inhibitors and most recently in the last two years immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is currently being investigated if it can be administered alone or in combination. Previously we have investigated whether immunotherapy compounds can be produced as aerosols , and in the current study we investigated the safety and efficiency independently of the programmed death-ligand 1. The aerosol administration of both cisplatin and nivolumab is possible. The combination of the two drugs has a synergistic effect and therefore should be considered an option. Time of administration for immunotherapy is also very important.
