  The aims of the present study were to establish the maximally tolerated dose ( MTD) of the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproate together with R-CHOP ( rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisone) in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL). A phase 1 dose escalation study of valproate together with R-CHOP followed by a dose expansion study using the established MTD of valproate was performed. MTD of valproate together with R-CHOP was established at 60 mg/kg per day , as higher doses resulted in auditory adverse events ( AEs). In the study population , 2-year progression-free survival was 84.7 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 73.2 % -98 %). The 2-year overall survival ( OS) was 96.8 % ( n = 31; 95 % CI , 90.8 % -100 %). These data were compared with 2 risk-factor matched populations of R-CHOP-treated patients from the Swedish Lymphoma Registry ( cohort A , n = 330 and B , n = 165). As compared with the matched cohorts , we observed a statistically significant (
