  Yeast flocculation is the reversible formation of multicellular complexes mediated by lectin-like cell wall proteins binding to neighbouring cells. Strong flocculation can improve the inhibitor tolerance and fermentation performance of yeast cells in second generation bioethanol production. The strength of flocculation increases with the size of the flocculation protein and is strain dependent. However , the large number of internal repeats in the sequence of
