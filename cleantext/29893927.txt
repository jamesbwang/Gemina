  Numerous studies have attempted to develop a new in vitro eye irritation test ( EIT). To obtain more reliable results from EIT , potential new biomarkers that reflect eye irritation by chemicals must be identified. We investigated candidate biomarkers for eye irritation , using a proteomics approach. Sodium lauryl sulfate ( SLS) or benzalkonium chloride ( BAC) was applied on a reconstructed human cornea-like epithelium model , MCTT HCETM , and corneal protein expression was examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We found that ezrin ( EZR) was significantly up-regulated by SLS or BAC. In addition , up-regulation of EZR in immortalized human corneal cells treated with SLS or BAC was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and western blot analysis. Furthermore , other well-known eye irritants such as cetylpyridinium bromide , Triton X-100 , cyclohexanol , ethanol , 2-methyl-1-pentanol , and sodium hydroxide significantly increased EZR expression in immortalized human corneal cells. Induction of EZR promoter activity in irritant-treated human corneal cells was confirmed by a luciferase gene reporter assay. In conclusion , EZR expression may be a potential biomarker for detecting eye irritation , which may substantially improve the performance of in vitro EIT.
