  When urate lowering therapy is indicated in patients with gout , medication adherence is essential. This study assesses non-persistence and non-adherence in patients with newly diagnosed gout , and identifies factors associated with poor medication adherence. A retrospective data analysis was performed within the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink ( 1987-2014) among incident gout patients , aged ⩾ 40 years and starting allopurinol ( n = 48 280). The proportion of patients non-persistent ( a first medication gap of ⩾ 90 days) after 1 and 5 years , and median time until a first 90-day gap was estimated using Kaplan-Meier statistics in those starting allopurinol and restarting after a first interruption. Non-adherence ( proportion of days covered < 80 %) over the full observation period was calculated. Multivariable Cox- or logistic regressions assessed factors associated with non-persistence or non-adherence , respectively. Non-persistence increased from 38.5 % ( 95 % CI: 38.1 , 38.9) to 56.9 % ( 95 % CI: 56.4 , 57.4) after 1 and 5 years of initiation. Median time until a first 90-day gap was 1029 days ( 95 % CI: 988 , 1078) and 61 % were non-adherent. After a first gap , 43.3 % ( 95 % CI: 42.7 , 43.9) restarted therapy within 1 year , yet only 52.3 % ( 95 % CI: 51.4 , 53.1) persisted for 1 year. Being female and a current smoker increased the risk for non-persistence and non-adherence , while older age , overweight , receiving anti-hypertensive medication or colchicine and suffering from dementia , diabetes or dyslipidaemia decreased the risk. Medication adherence among gout patients starting allopurinol is poor , particularly among females and younger patients and patients with fewer comorbidities. Medication adherence remains low in those reinitiating after a first gap.
