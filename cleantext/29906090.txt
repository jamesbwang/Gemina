  This paper examines how the difference in the spatial orientation of the capture substrate influences the analytical sensitivity and limits of detection for immunoassays that use gold nanoparticle labels ( AuNPs) and rely on diffusion in quiet solution in the antigen capture and labeling steps. Ideally , the accumulation of both reactants should follow a dependence governed by the rate in which diffusion delivers reactants to the capture surface. In other words , the accumulation of reactants should increase with the square root of the incubation time , i.e. , t
