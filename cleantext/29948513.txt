  The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of Lactobacillus<pathogen> curvatus<pathogen> CRL705 , CRL1532 , and CRL1533 and Lactobacillus<pathogen> sakei CRL1613 to survive under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Moreover , a microencapsulation approach was proposed to improve gastrointestinal survival. Finally , experiments were performed to demonstrate that Lactobacillus<pathogen> spp. can modulate the ability of Listeria<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> FBUNT to adhere to and invade Caco-2 cells. Lactobacillus<pathogen> strains were encapsulated in alginate beads to enhance the survival of bacteria under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions. All strains hydrolyzed bile salts using chenodeoxycholic acid as a substrate and adhered to Caco-2 cells. Cell-free supernatants ( CFSs) showed antimicrobial activity against L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> as demonstrated by agar diffusion assays. The average percentages of L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> adhesion decreased from 67.74 to 41.75 and 38.7 % in the presence of 50 and 90 % ( v/v) , respectively , for all CFSs tested. The highest concentrations of CFSs completely inhibited the L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> invasion of Caco-2 cells. The studied Lactobacillus<pathogen> strains have protective effects against the adhesion and invasion of L.<pathogen> monocytogenes<pathogen> FBUNT. Alginate encapsulation of these bacteria improved gastrointestinal tolerance such that they could be further studied as potential probiotics against intestinal pathogenic bacteria.
