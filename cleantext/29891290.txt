  Three-dimensional ( 3D) cell printing is a unique technique that enables free-form fabrication of cell-laden hydrogel scaffolds with controllable features and interconnected pores for tissue engineering applications. To this end , bioink materials able to offer good printability and favorable cellular interaction are highly required. Herein , we synthesized alginate sulfate , which is a structural mimic of heparin that can strongly bind with growth factors to prolong their activities , and studied its feasibility for cell printing applications. Several bio-inks composed of alginate and alginate-sulfate were studied to characterize their material properties and their utilities in 3D printing. The inclusion of alginate-sulfate in bio-inks ( alginate/alginate-sulfate) did not significantly influence their rheological properties and allowed for a good 3D printing processibility with distinct pores and features. Moreover , alginate/alginate-sulfate bio-inks exhibited an improved retention of bone morphogenetic protein 2 in 3D-printed scaffolds. Osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation in vitro were promoted by alginate/alginate-sulfate 3D-printed constructs with an optimal composition of 3 % alginate and 2 % alginate-sulfate. We envision that bio-inks displaying prolonged interactions with growth factors will be useful for tissue engineering applications including bone regeneration.
