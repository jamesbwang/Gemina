  Natural Pestivirus H infections in cattle have been reported worldwide; however , only a few cases of Pestivirus H have been described in non-bovine ruminants such as goats. A new Pestivirus H HN1507 strain was isolated from an infected goat in 2015 and the genome sequence was determined. The full-length genome sequence was 12,556 nucleotides. Phylogenetic analysis , based on the complete genome and Npro fragments , revealed that the isolate belonged to Pestivirus H and was closely related to strains from Italy. Two unique amino acid substitutions were found in the C-terminal of the E2 protein. To the best of our knowledge , this is first report determining the complete genome of a Pestivirus H strain from goat.
