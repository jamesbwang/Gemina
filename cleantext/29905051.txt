  To evaluate the effectiveness of a new type of sutured titanium wire combined with titanium nail internal fixation in correction of serious old medial canthus deformity. Between March 2012 and June 2015 , 18 patients with unilateral serious old medial canthus deformity were treated. There were 14 males and 4 females. The patient 's age ranged from 23 to 62 years ( mean , 42 years). The causes of deformity included accident injury in 10 cases , boxing injury in 4 cases , sharp device scratching in 3 cases , and animal bite in 1 case. All patients had been treated with suture or steel wire fixation in other hospitals to correct the medial canthus deformity and the deformity recurred. The interval between this operation and the first operation was 6 months to 2 years ( mean , 16 months). The nasal root or medial canthus skin scar incision was used as the operative approach , and the adhesion of the medial canthus ligament to the adjacent tissues was fully loosened , then the tail end of the new type sutured titanium wire was fixed to the residual end of the medial canthus ligament. After passing through the scar tissue , the needle end of wire was fixed on the titanium nail in the bone wall of anterior lacrimal crest. The position and shape of the medial canthus angle was determined by adjusting the tightness of titanium wire. All incisions healed by first intention. All patients were followed up 6-12 months ( mean , 10 months). In 16 cases , the medial canthus deformity was obviously corrected , and the appearances of bilateral eyes were basically symmetrical , without exposure of titanium nail and titanium wire. The medial canthus was retreated at 2 mm after 6 months in 2 cases , who were satisfied with their appearance without reoperation. Application of the new type of suture titanium wire combined with titanium nail in the correction of serious old medial canthus deformity can achieve good effectiveness with the low recurrence rate.
