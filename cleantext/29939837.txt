  Silver nanoparticles ( AgNP) , with their important properties , are being used in a range of sectors from industry to medicine , leading to increased human exposure. Hence , their toxicity potential needs to be comprehensively evaluated. It was postulated that within small-sized ( ≤ 20 nm) polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated silver nanoparticles ( PVP-AgNP) , minor size differences may significantly induce different toxicity profiles and involve varying cellular pathways. Therefore , the aim of this study was to examine the influence of differing size AgNP with 10 nm ( AgNP10) and 20 nm ( AgNP20) ( up to 100 µg/ml) , as well as to ionic silver as AgNO
