  The incidence of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome<disease> ( NS) is 1 · 15-16 · 9 per 100 000 children , varying by ethnicity and region. The cause remains unknown but the pathogenesis of idiopathic NS is thought to involve immune dysregulation , systemic circulating factors , or inherited structural abnormalities of the podocyte. Genetic risk is more commonly described among children with steroid-resistant disease. The mainstay of therapy is prednisone for the vast majority of patients who are steroid responsive; however , the disease can run a frequently relapsing course , necessitating the need for alternative immunosuppressive agents. Infection and venous thromboembolism are the main complications of NS with also increased risk of acute kidney injury. Prognosis in terms of long-term kidney outcome overall is excellent for steroid-responsive disease , and steroid resistance is an important determinant of future risk of chronic or end-stage kidney disease.
