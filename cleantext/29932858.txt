 - Mammographic screening has increased the incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS) , but this has not been accompanied by a decline in the incidence of invasive carcinoma ( IC). Consequently , the surgical treatment of DCIS has recently been questioned , with some advocating only surveillance ( with or without neoadjuvant endocrine therapy) after a core biopsy diagnosis of DCIS.- To examine the predictive value of a core biopsy diagnosis of DCIS , particularly the upgrade rate to IC , and to identify associated factors.- Using the pathology database , we identified 2943 cases of DCIS diagnosed on core biopsy from 2000 to 2015; of which , 229 cases ( 8 %) later had the stage upgraded to IC.- Ages ranged from 25 to 90 years ( mean , 59 years). The DCIS presented with calcifications in 151 of 229 cases ( 65.9 %) , was widespread in 26 of 151 cases ( 17 %) , had a mass or density present in 70 of 229 cases ( 31 %) , with heterogeneous echogenic features in 44 of those 70 cases ( 63 %) , and an enhancement upon magnetic resonance imaging in 8 of 229 cases ( 3.5 %). Of the 229 cases , the DCIS grades were as follows: low in 29 cases ( 13 %) , intermediate in 79 cases ( 36 %) , and high in 121 cases ( 53 %). Of the 229 cases , necrosis<symptom> was present in 152 ( 66.4 %) and was comedo necrosis<symptom> in 99 cases ( 43 %). Of the 229 cases of IC , the tumor stage was as follows: microIC in 36 ( 16 %) , T1a in 119 ( 52 %) , T1b in 35 ( 15 %) , T1c in 28 ( 12 %) , T2 in 8 ( 3 %) , and T3 in 3 cases ( 1 %). Axillary lymph nodes were staged in 167 patients as follows: N0 , 141 cases ( 84 %); N0 ( i +) , 14 cases ( 8 %); and N1 , 12 cases ( 7 %). The 12 N1 cases were subclassified by T stage as follows: T1a , 1 case ( 8 %); T1b , 4 cases ( 33 %); T1c , 2 cases ( 17 %); T2 , 4 cases ( 33 %); and T3 , 1 case ( 8 %). The IC cases of stage upgrading were predominantly smaller than 2 cm ( 218 of 229; 95 %) , and more than two-thirds were smaller than 0.5 cm ( 155 of 229; 95 %) , most of which were accompanied by extensive DCIS.- Approximately one-half of the upgrades were associated with high-grade DCIS , especially with comedo necrosis<symptom>; nevertheless , the other one-half of the upgrades were due to low- and intermediate-grade DCIS and should not be underestimated. There were few positive results from axillary lymph node biopsies , but they occurred in 3 % ( 7 of 218) of the carcinomas smaller than 2 cm. Our findings indicate that caution is needed when DCIS cases diagnosed by core biopsy are treated nonsurgically with surveillance ( with or without neoadjuvant endocrine therapy) , given the number of cases ( 229 of 2943; 8 %) that are upgraded to IC and those with axillary lymph node metastases ( 12 of 167; 7 %).
