  There is ample evidence that regular moderate to vigorous aerobic physical activity is related to a reduced risk for various forms of cancer to suggest a causal relationship. Exercise is associated with positive changes in fitness , body composition , and physical functioning as well as in patient-reported outcomes such as fatigue<symptom> , sleep quality , or health-related quality of life. Emerging evidence indicates that exercise may also be directly linked to the control of tumour biology through direct effects on tumour-intrinsic factors. Beside a multitude of effects of exercise on the human body , one underscored effect of exercise training is to target the specific metabolism of tumour cells , namely the Warburg-type highly glycolytic metabolism. Tumour metabolism as well as the tumour ‚Åª host interaction may be selectively influenced by single bouts as well as regularly applied exercise , dependent on exercise intensity , duration , frequency and mode. High-intensity anaerobic exercise was shown to inhibit glycolysis and some studies in animals showed that effects on tumour growth might be stronger compared with moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. High-intensity exercise was shown to be safe in patients; however , it has to be applied carefully with an individualized prescription of exercise.
