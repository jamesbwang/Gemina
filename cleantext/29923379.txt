  To analyse 73 medical malpractice cases of pediatrics for discussing the importance of forensic pathology in solving the issues such as medical malpractice of pediatrics. From January 2002 to August 2016 , 73 medical malpractice cases of pediatrics with age of death between 28 days old and 10 years old were collected from Institute of Judical Expertise of Nanjing Medical University. The relationship between causes of death and related medical institutions was retrospectively analysed. In 73 cases , the male to female ratio was 1.70 ∶ 1 , and ages of 28 days old to 1 year old were common （ 26 cases , 35.62 % ） , followed by ages between 1 year old and 3 years old （ 21 cases , 28.77 % ）. In 71 cases which had been determined the cause of death by postmortem examination , the main cause of death was disease , especially respiratory<disease> diseases<disease> （ 33 cases , 46.48 % ） , followed by cardiovascular diseases （ 12 cases , 16.90 % ）. In 75 medical institutes which involved with these medical malpractices , most were tertiary medical institutes （ 32 , 42.67 % ） , followed by the sub-secondary （ excluding the secondary ） medical institutions （ 23 , 30.67 % ）. The clinical diagnosis of 38 cases （ 52.05 % ） completely or mostly corresponded with the pathological findings. There were 35 cases （ 47.95 % ） undefined or misdiagnosed cases. Autopsy and forensic pathological examination contribute to determine causes of death , which not only provide scientific evidence for medical malpractice of pediatrics , but also enrich and develop clinical medical knowledge , and thus improve diagnosis and treatment level in a certain extent.
