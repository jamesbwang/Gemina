  A number of 2- ( hetero) aryl-substituted thieno ( 3,2-b) indoles have been successfully prepared using an efficient transition-metal-free strategy , involving the Fiesselmann synthesis of methyl 5- ( hetero) aryl-3-hydroxythiophene-2-carboxylates from 2-bromo-3- ( hetero) arylacrylates and methyl thioglycolate , and the transformation of the synthesized 3-hydroxyesters into the corresponding thiophen-3 ( 2H)- ones , followed by their treatment with arylhydrazines to directly form the targeted structures via Fischer indolization. At the same time , structural variety of the obtained thieno ( 3,2-b) indoles has been achieved due to a wide range of available starting materials , including both 2-bromo-3- ( hetero) arylacrylates and arylhydrazines. In addition , two Ï€-extended molecules , namely 1,4-bis ( 4H-thieno ( 3,2-b) indol-2-yl) benzene and 2,5-bis ( 4H-thieno ( 3,2-b) indol-2-yl) thiophene , have been synthesized in line with the current approach towards 2- ( hetero) arylated thieno ( 3,2-b) indoles.
