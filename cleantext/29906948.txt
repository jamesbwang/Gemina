  A recent approach that led to compact frequency domain formulations of the cubic and quartic fluctuation-dissipation theorems ( FDTs) for the classical one-component plasma ( OCP) ( Golden and Heath , J. Stat. Phys. 162 , 199 ( 2016) 10.1007/ s10955-015-1395-6) is generalized to accommodate binary ionic mixtures. Paralleling the procedure followed for the OCP , the basic premise underlying the present approach is that a ( k , ω) 4-vector rotational symmetry , known to be a pivotal feature in the frequency domain architectures of the linear and quadratic fluctuation-dissipation relations for a variety of Coulomb plasmas ( Golden et al. , J. Stat. Phys. 6 , 87 ( 1972) 10.1007/ BF01023681; J. Stat. Phys. 29 , 281 ( 1982) 10.1007/ BF01020787; Golden , Phys. Rev. E 59 , 228 ( 1999) 10.1103/ PhysRevE .59.228) , is expected to be a pivotal feature of the frequency domain architectures of the higher-order members of the FDT hierarchy. On this premise , each member , in its most tractable form , connects a single ( p +1)- point dynamical structure function to a linear combination of ( p +1)- order p density response functions; by definition , such a combination must also remain invariant under rotation of their ( k _ ( 1) , ω _ ( 1)) , ( k _ ( 2) , ω _ ( 2)) ,... , ( k _ ( p) , ω _ ( p)) , ( k _ ( 1) + k _ ( 2) + ⋯ + k _ ( p) , ω _ ( 1) + ω _ ( 2) + ⋯ + ω _ ( p)) 4-vector arguments. Assigned to each 4-vector is a species index that corotates in lock step. Consistency is assured by matching the static limits of the resulting frequency domain cubic and quartic FDTs to their exact static counterparts independently derived in the present work via a conventional time-independent perturbation expansion of the Liouville distribution function in its macrocanonical form. The proposed procedure entirely circumvents the daunting issues of entangled Liouville space paths and nested Poisson brackets that one would encounter if one attempted to use the conventional time-dependent perturbation-theoretic Kubo approach to establish the frequency domain FDTs beyond quadratic order.
