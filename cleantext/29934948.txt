  We estimated the probability of device replacement in an unselected population of pacemaker recipients , with automatic management of atrial and ventricular pacing output. We considered a cohort of 542 pacemaker patients ( age 78 ± 9 years , 60 % male , 71 % de-novo implants) and combined 1-month projected device longevity with survival data and late complication rate in a 3-state Markov model tested in several Monte Carlo computer simulations. Predetermined subgroups were: age < or ≥ 70; gender; primary indication to cardiac pacing. At the 1-month follow-up the reported projected device longevity was 153 ± 45 months. With these values the proportion of patients expected to undergo a device replacement due to battery depletion was higher in patients aged < 70 49.9 % , range 32.1 % -61.9 %) than in age ≥ 70 ( 24.5 % ,19.9 % -28.8 %); in women ( 39.9 % , ( 30.8 % -48.1 %) than in men ( 32.0 % ,24.7 % -37.5 %); in sinus node dysfunction ( 41.5 % 30.2 % -53.0 %) than in atrio-ventricular block ( 33.5 % , 27.1-38.8 %) or atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> with bradycardia<symptom> ( 27.9 % , 18.5 % -37.0 %). The expected replacement rate was inversely related to the assumed device longevity and depended on age class: a 50 % increase in battery longevity implied a 5 % reduction of replacement rates in patients aged ≥ 80. With current device technology 1/4 of pacemaker recipients aged ≥ 70 are expected to receive a second device in their life. Replacement rate depends on age , gender and primary indication owing to differences in patients ' survival expectancy. Additional improvements in device service time may modestly impact expected replacement rates especially in patients ≥ 80 years. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
