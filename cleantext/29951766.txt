  Laboratory and greenhouse experiments were carried out to investigate the chemical , physical , and microbial properties of seawater-neutralized bauxite residues and the effects of additional leaching ( 1 pore volume of deionized water versus an additional 6 pore volumes) and amendment with gypsum ( 5 %) and/or cattle manure ( 6 %) on its properties and on the growth of Rhodes grass ( Chloris gayana). Additional leaching resulted in a decrease in EC , exchangeable Na , SAR , and ESP. For unamended control treatments , additional leaching induced a rise in pH
