  The Wnt/ <i> β-catenin </i> signaling pathway plays an integral role in skeletal biology , spanning from embryonic skeletal patterning , through bone maintenance and bone repair. Most experimental methods to antagonize Wnt signaling in vivo are either systemic or transient , including genetic approaches , use of small molecule inhibitors , or neutralizing antibodies. We sought to develop a novel , localized model of prolonged Wnt/β-catenin signaling blockade by the application and validation of a lentivirus encoding <i> β-catenin </i> shRNA. Efficacy of lentiviral encoded <i> β-catenin </i> shRNA was first confirmed in vitro using bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stromal cells ( BMSC) , and in vivo using an intramedullary long bone injection model in NOD SCID mice. Next , the effects of <i> β-catenin </i> knockdown were assessed in a calvarial bone defect model , in which the frontal bone demonstrates enhanced bone healing associated with heightened Wnt/ <i> β-catenin </i> signaling. Lentivirus encoding either <i> β-catenin </i> shRNA or random sequence shRNA with eGFP ( control) were injected overlying the calvaria of NOD SCID mice and bone defects were created in either the frontal or parietal bones. Among mice treated with lentivirus encoding <i> β-catenin </i> shRNA , frontal bone defect healing was significantly reduced by all radiographic and histologic metrics. In contrast , parietal bone healing was minimally impacted by <i> β-catenin </i> shRNA. In aggregate , our data documents the application and validation of a lentivirus encoding <i> β-catenin </i> shRNA model that represents an easily replicable tool for examining the importance of locoregional Wnt/ <i> β-catenin </i> signaling in bone biology and regeneration.
