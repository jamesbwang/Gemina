  Ghrelin , the only known orexigenic gut hormone produced primarily in the stomach , has lately gained attention as a potential treatment for anorexia<symptom> and cachexia. However , its biological stability is highly limited , therefore a number of both peptide and non-peptide ghrelin analogs have been synthesized. In this study , we provide in vitro and in vivo characterization of a series of novel peptide growth hormone secretagogue receptor ( GHS-R1a) agonists , both under non-pathological conditions and in the context of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced anorexia<symptom> These analogs were based on our previous series modified by replacing the Ser3 with diaminopropionic acid ( Dpr) , the N-terminal Gly with sarcosine and Phe4 with various non-coded amino acids. New analogs were further modified by replacing the n-octanoyl bound to Dpr3 with longer or unsaturated fatty acid residues , by incorporation of the second fatty acid residue into the molecule , or by shortening the peptide chain. These modifications preserved the ability of ghrelin analogs to bind to the membranes<symptom> of cells transfected with GHS-R1a , as well as the GHS-R1a signaling activation. The selected analogs exhibited long-lasting and potent orexigenic effects after a single subcutaneous ( s.c.) administration in mice. The stability of new ghrelin analogs in mice after s.c. administration was significantly higher when compared to ghrelin and ( Dpr3) ghrelin , with half-lives of approximately 2 hours. A single s.c. injection of the selected ghrelin analogs in mice with LPS-induced anorexia<symptom> significantly increased food intake via the activation of orexigenic pathways and normalized blood levels of proinflammatory cytokines , demonstrating the anti-inflammatory potential of the analogs.
