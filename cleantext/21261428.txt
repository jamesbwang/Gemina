  This study explores the impacts of repeated curricular activities designed to promote metacognitive skills development and academic achievement on students in an introductory biology course. Prior to this study , the course curriculum was enhanced with pre-assignments containing comprehension monitoring and self-evaluation questions , exam review assignments with reflective questions related to study habits , and an optional opportunity for students to explore metacognition and deep versus surface learning. We used a mixed-methods study design and collected data over two semesters. Self-evaluation , a component of metacognition , was measured via exam score postdictions , in which students estimated their exam scores after completing their exam. Metacognitive awareness was assessed using the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory ( MAI) and a reflective essay designed to gauge students ' perceptions of their metacognitive skills and study habits. In both semesters , more students over-predicted their Exam 1 scores than under-predicted , and statistical tests revealed significantly lower mean exam scores for the over-predictors. By Exam 3 , under-predictors still scored significantly higher on the exam , but they outnumbered the over-predictors. Lower-performing students also displayed a significant increase in exam postdiction accuracy by Exam 3. While there was no significant difference in students ' MAI scores from the beginning to the end of the semester , qualitative analysis of reflective essays indicated that students benefitted from the assignments and could articulate clear action plans to improve their learning and performance. Our findings suggest that assignments designed to promote metacognition can have an impact on students over the course of one semester and may provide the greatest benefits to lower-performing students.
