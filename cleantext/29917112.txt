  In order to enable local response to viral haemorrhagic fever<disease> outbreaks a mobile laboratory transportable on commercial flights was developed. The development progressed from use of mobile real time RT-PCR to mobile Recombinase Polymerase Amplification ( RT-RPA). The various stages of the mobile laboratory development are described. A brief overview of its deployments , which culminated in the first on site detection of Ebola<disease> virus<disease> disease<disease> ( EVD) in March 2014 and a successful use in a campaign to roll back EVD cases in Conakry in the West-Africa Ebola<disease> virus outbreak are described. The developed mobile laboratory successfully enabled local teams to perform rapid viral haemorrhagic fever<disease> disgnostics.
