  Calcium Gluconate Extravasation is a process that can cause serious lesions<symptom> , such as necrosis<symptom> and calcification of the soft tissues. The aim of the present study is to analyze the beneficial effects of four possible local antidotes for calcium gluconate extravasation: hyaluronidase , sodium thiosulfate , triamcinolone acetonide and physiological saline solution. 74 BALB/c mice were used in the study. The substances selected for use in this study were calcium gluconate ( 4.6 mEq/ml) , hyaluronidase ( 1500 IU/ml) , sodium thiosulfate ( 25 %) , triamcinolone acetonide ( 40 mg/ml 0.5 mg/kg) and saline solution 0.9 %. Five minutes were allowed to lapse after the calcium gluconate infiltration and then an antidote was infiltrated. After three weeks , a skin biopsy was performed and a radiographic and histological study carried out. Only in the group infiltrated with sodium thiosulfate did all skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> disappear after the 3-week period following infiltration. In the radiographic study , calcium deposits larger than 0.5 mm were observed in 40 % of cases without an antidote , in 33 % with triamcinolone acetonide , in 13 % with a saline solution and none at all with thiosulfate and hyaluronidase. In the histological study , calcium deposits were found in 53 % of cases without antidote , 100 % of cases with triamcinolone acetonide , 33 % of cases with saline solution and 13 % of cases with sodium thiosulfate or hyaluronidase. Sodium thiosulfate and hyaluronidase prevent the development of calcium deposits after calcium gluconate extravasation.
