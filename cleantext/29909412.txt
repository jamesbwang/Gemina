  Nearly 15 years after the first description of neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs) , our knowledge concerning this structure has expanded considerably. Initially , NETs were considered solely an elaborate function of the innate immune system to combat invading microorganisms. Successively it became clear that NETs have farther-reaching capabilities. They are involved in a series of pathophysiological mechanisms ranging from inflammation<symptom> to thrombosis where they fulfill essential functions when produced at the right site and the right time but can have a serious impact when generation or clearance of NETs is inadequately controlled. This review provides a concise overview on the far-reaching functions of NETs in health and disease.
