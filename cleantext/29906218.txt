  To examine the reciprocal relationships between parenting stress and psychosocial adjustment of children with congenital craniofacial anomalies ( CFAs) at 2 time points: school entry and approximately 2.5 years later , after children had time to adjust to school. Retrospective review of medical charts of children with CFAs. Department of reconstructive plastic surgery at an urban medical center. Parents of 42 children aged 3.9 to 6.5 years at time 1 and 6.5 and 9.8 years at time 2. Parenting Stress Index/Short Form and Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL) , both completed by parents at time 1 and time 2. Compared to norms , more parents scored in the clinical range on parenting stress both at time 1 and time 2. Parenting stress remained stable across the 2 time points. Although rates of psychosocial problems for boys were comparable to those of the CBCL normative sample , higher-than-expected rates of clinically significant internalizing and externalizing were found for girls at time 2. Parenting stress at time 1 was associated with child internalizing and externalizing problems at time 2. Whereas child externalizing problems at time 1 predicted parenting stress at time 2 , child internalizing at time 1 showed trivial effects on time 2 parenting stress. Early school years may be a period that is particularly stressful for parents of children with CFAs. There appears to be a transactional relationship between parenting stress and child psychosocial adjustment during the early school years.
