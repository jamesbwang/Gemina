  Fluid baits comprised of 10 % dry medium ( impregnated with 0.5 % hexaflumuron) and 90 % methylcel solution were injected into foraging galleries of the Formosan subterranean termite , Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki ( Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) , in trees and buildings. Elimination times at two of the six baited sites were longer than expected , possibly due to the application disturbance or the presence of an old and declining colony , but fluid bait treatments eliminated all baited colonies. Fluid baits were injected through drill holes behind infested wood surface , and bypassed the difficulties for installing above-ground ( AG) bait stations on uneven surface or at tight corners. Because a large quantity of fluid baits could be applied at once , termite control professionals may be able to avoid revisiting the site to add more baits. The absence of unsightly AG station in a house will also make fluid baits more acceptable to homeowners than AG baits. Currently , local applications of liquid termiticides are common practices because termite control professionals are often urged by homeowners to take remedial actions when termites are found in a house , but such treatments only drive termites away from the active loci without affecting the termite colony ( s). Remedial treatments with fluid baits would result in immediate bait consumption and shorten colony elimination time with or without the use of in-ground baiting systems. Introduction of fluid baits will add another tool to the termite control industry and will make it more plausible for the homeowners to accept baiting technology.
