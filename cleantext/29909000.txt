  The `` liquid biopsies '' are samples of liquids such as blood , urine , spinal fluid that can contain tumor material. Clinical assays have been mainly focused on the peripheral blood containing circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA. The circulating tumor cells are cancer cells released from the primary tumor or recurrences or metastases. They enter into the bloodstream after passing through the vessel wall. It is possible to analyze the circulating tumor cells by means of all cytologic and biomolecular techniques. The free circulating tumor DNA is made of fragments of DNA released by living or necrotic tumor cells proceeded from any place of the organism. The free circulating tumor DNA and DNA from circulating tumor cells show structural rearrangements among which some are therapeutic targets. Many studies showed that circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA analyses are useful in revealing recurrences and tracking therapeutic targets.
