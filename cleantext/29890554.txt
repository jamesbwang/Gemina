  This study was to analyze the efficacy of metformin intervention in preventing gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM). A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials or observational studies of metformin intervention in preventing symptoms of GDM during pregnancy were performed. Medline , Embase , and Cochrane Library were searched through to now. The main evaluated primary outcomes were incident of GDM , miscarriage , preterm delivery , and neonatal mortality. The evaluated secondary outcomes were mean difference of gestational age at birth and birth weight between metformin group and control group. We included 6 studies including 3 randomized clinical trials ( RCTs) , 2 observational studies , and 1 non-RCT in our meta-analysis. A total of 643 patients were enrolled for a follow-up study with continued metformin therapy ( n = 341) or not ( n = 302) during pregnancy. Metformin therapy reduced the proportion of patients developing GDM ( log Odds Ratio: -1.27; 95 % CI: -2.24 to -0.30) but had no significant effect on reducing the proportion of abortion<disease> , preterm delivery , and neonatal death in pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome<disease> ( PCOS). Also , it did not cause a significant difference in gestational age at birth and birth weight in metformin group versus control/placebo group. Metformin was associated with less frequent GDM development than control diets , suggesting that it is the appropriate intervention to be prescribed to prevent GDM in patients with PCOS.
