  Multicomponent supramolecular gels have great potential for optoelectronics. Ideally , we could control the self-assembly of multiple components across many length scales , from the primary assembled structures to how these are arranged in space. This would allow energy transfer between p-type and n-type fibers to be controlled. Usually , a single network is formed and analyzed. It is not clear how most networks could be modified , and certainly not how these might be differentiated. Here , we address both of these issues. We show how the different components in a multicomponent gel can be differentiated by small-angle neutron scattering using contrast-matching experiments. The rate of self-assembly can be used to vary the networks that are formed , leading directly to changes in the efficiency of electron transfer. The assembly kinetics can therefore be used to prepare different networks from the same primary building blocks and primary self-assembled structures. We expect that these advances will allow multicomponent systems to become effective electronic materials.
