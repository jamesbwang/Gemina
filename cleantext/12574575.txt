  Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs) are a group of proteins that induce the formation of bone and the development of the nervous system. BMP-3b , also known as growth and differentiation factor 10 , is a member of the BMPs that is highly expressed in the developing and adult brain. BMP-3b is therefore thought to play an important role in the brain even after physiological neurogenesis has completed. BMP-3b is induced in peri-infarct neurons in aged brains and is one of the most highly upregulated genes during the initiation of axonal sprouting. However , little is known about the role of BMP-3b in neonatal brain injury. In the present study , we aimed to describe the effects of BMP-3b gene depletion on neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy , which frequently results in death or lifelong neurological disabilities , such as cerebral palsy and mental retardation. BMP-3b knockout and wild type mice were prepared at postnatal day 12. Mice of each genotype were divided into sham-surgery , mild hypoxia-ischemia ( HI) , and severe HI groups (
