  Neuro-orthopaedic surgery is recognized as an effective treatment to improve walking capacity in case of spastic equinovarus foot. However , the effect of surgery on the 3 domains of the International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health ( ICF) has never been studied. To assess the efficacy of the neuro-orthopaedic surgery for spastic equinovarus foot after stroke based on a goal-centered approach and on the 3 domains of the International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health ( ICF). Prospective , single blind , case-series , intervention study ( before-after trial) with a 1-year follow-up. Eighteen hemiplegic patients with spastic equinovarus foot. A selective tibial neurotomy and/or an Achille tendon lengthening and/or a tibialis anterior tendon transfer were performed to correct a disabling SEF. The primary outcome measure was the goal attainment scale. The secondary outcome measures included body function and structure ( spasticity , strength , range of motion , pain , gait speed , ankle kinematics) , activities ( walking aids , functional ambulation category , functional walking category , ABILOCO) and social participation and quality of life ( Satispart-Stroke , SF-36) assessment before and 2 months and 1 year after surgery. An increase in the goal attainment scale score , in the body function and activity/participation domains of the ICF , a decrease in triceps spasticity and pain , an increase in ankle range of motion and gait speed , an improvement in equinus<pathogen> and a reduction in walking aids were observed. This study confirms the efficacy of the neuro-orthopaedic surgical treatment of spastic equinovarus foot after stroke to improve walking capacities and to achieve personal goals in the body function and activity/participation domains of the ICF.
