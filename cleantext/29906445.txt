  The evidence that most adult-onset common diseases have a polygenic genetic architecture fully consistent with robust biological systems supported by multiple back-up mechanisms is now overwhelming. In this context , we consider the recent `` omnigenic '' or `` core genes '' model. A key assumption of the model is that there is a relatively small number of core genes relevant to any disease. While intuitively appealing , this model may underestimate the biological complexity of common disease , and therefore , the goal to discover core genes should not guide experimental design. We consider other implications of polygenicity , concluding that a focus on patient stratification is needed to achieve the goals of precision medicine.
