  Tapentadol is a centrally acting analgesic with a dual mode of action as a Î¼-opioid receptor ( MOR) agonist and a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor ( NRI). It was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in November 2008 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute<symptom> pain<symptom> in adult patients , and in August 2011 , for chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> in an prolonged release form in the same population. Due to its limited protein binding capacity , the absence of active metabolites and significant microsomal enzyme induction or inhibition , tapentadol has a limited potential for drug-drug interactions. It appears to be well-tolerated and effective in the treatment of moderate-to severe acute and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>. Owing to its dual mechanism of action , it is hypothesized to be good option in the treatment of both nociceptive and neuropathic pain.
