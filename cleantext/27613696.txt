  Idiopathic pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( IPF) is a devastating interstitial lung disease , characterized by damage of lung epithelial cells , excessive deposition of extracellular matrix in the lung interstitium , and enhanced activation and proliferation of fibroblasts. S100a4 , also termed FSP-1 ( fibroblast-specific protein-1) , was previously considered as a marker of fibroblasts but recent findings in renal and liver fibrosis<disease> indicated that M2 macrophages are an important cellular source of S100a4. Thus , we hypothesized that also in pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> , M2 macrophages produce and secrete S100a4 , and that secreted S100a4 induces the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts. To prove this hypothesis , we comprehensively characterized two established mouse models of lung<disease> fibrosis<disease>: infection of IFN-Î³R
