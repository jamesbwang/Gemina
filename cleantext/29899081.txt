  Decreased gut microbial gene richness ( MGR) and compositional changes are associated with adverse metabolism in overweight or moderate obesity , but lack characterisation in severe obesity. Bariatric surgery ( BS) improves metabolism and inflammation<symptom> in severe obesity and is associated with gut microbiota modifications. Here , we characterised severe obesity-associated dysbiosis ( ie , MGR , microbiota composition and functional characteristics) and assessed whether BS would rescue these changes. Sixty-one severely obese subjects , candidates for adjustable gastric banding ( AGB , n = 20) or Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass ( RYGB , n = 41) , were enrolled. Twenty-four subjects were followed at 1 , 3 and 12 months post-BS. Gut microbiota and serum metabolome were analysed using shotgun metagenomics and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( LC-MS). Confirmation groups were included. Low gene richness ( LGC) was present in 75 % of patients and correlated with increased trunk-fat mass and comorbidities ( type 2 diabetes , hypertension and severity). Seventy-eight metagenomic species were altered with LGC , among which 50 % were associated with adverse body composition and metabolic phenotypes. Nine serum metabolites ( including We identified major gut microbiota alterations in severe obesity , which include decreased MGR and related functional pathways linked with metabolic deteriorations. The lack of full rescue post-BS calls for additional strategies to improve the gut microbiota ecosystem and microbiome-host interactions in severe obesity. NCT01454232.
