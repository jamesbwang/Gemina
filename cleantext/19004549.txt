  Data sourcesMedline via PubMed , the Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched until April 2014. Study selectionRandomised controlled trials ( RCTs) comparing the efficacy of botulinum<pathogen> toxin type A ( BoTN-A) with placebo in patients with painful trigeminal ( TN) and postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN) reporting changes in pain intensity in patients aged 19 years and older available in English were included.Data extraction and synthesisThree authors independently assessed for inclusion , extracted standard data and assessed for risk of bias. The primary outcomes were baseline and post treatment intensity of pain and patients reporting pain relief of 50 % or greater.For continuous outcomes the treatment effect was measured as mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). For dichotomous outcome of reduction of pain of 50 % or more , relative risk ( risk ratio) with 95 % CIs was reported. Statistical heterogeneity was tested with Cochran 's test for heterogeneity and quantified by the I2 statistic. Results were combined using random-effects model in the presence of statistical heterogeneity otherwise fixed effect model was used.ResultsSix studies were included. The effects of the interventions were presented in three meta-analyses. Mean difference in post treatment pain ( six studies) pooled results showed a reduction of -3.009 in the VAS ( 95 % CI -4.566 to -1.453 p < 0.001) with the use of BoTN-A. Standardised difference in mean post treatment pain ( six studies) was -0.918 ( 95 % CI -1.197 to -0.639 p < 0.001) in favor of BoTN-A. For the percentage of patients experiencing 50 % pain reduction ( three studies) absolute risk difference and relative risk were calculated ( RR 2.892 , 95 % CI 1.726 to 4.848 p < 0.001) in favour of the use of BoTN-A. ConclusionsThe authors concluded that there is moderate evidence regarding the efficacy of BoTN-A in treating patients with trigeminal neuralgia and postherpetic neuralgia.
