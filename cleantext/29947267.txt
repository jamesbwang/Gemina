  The purpose of the current study is to create a contrast medium extraction method using raw-data-based electron density ( rED) and CT number from dual-energy CT ( DECT) for automatic delineation of the contrast region. A CT-ED phantom containing tissue-equivalent inserts and an acrylic phantom with an iodinated contrast medium were scanned by DECT. The contrast medium extraction system was created using Python. The accuracy of the contrast medium extraction was evaluated by measuring the diameter in terms of the full width at half maximum ( FWHM) and the ratio of the volume ( ROV). Mean-2SD CT numbers and the difference of the CT numbers ( DCT) of the contrast medium at 0-130 mg ml We created the contrast medium extraction method with rED and CT number images. The contrast medium extraction method could be used with DECT images at 80 kV/135 kV. The method is expected to only extract images from the region containing the contrast medium. Advances in knowledge: We created the contrast medium extraction method using raw-data-based electron density and CT number from DECT and it is expected to only extract information from the region containing the contrast medium.
