  Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) , mainly due to smoking , is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths. However , an increasing number of tumors- especially oropharyngeal cancer- are reported in non-smokers in association with the human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>). As HIV-infected individuals are particularly at risk of HPV-related disease , we aimed to describe the burden of HNSCC in this population. Retrospective chart review of patients from HIV<pathogen> clinics diagnosed with HNSCC between 2004 and 2014. Case patients were defined using the International Classification of Disease for Oncology ( 3 The 286 patients enrolled in the study had a median age at HNSCC diagnosis of 52 years; 84 % were males and 68 % had a history of smoking. The oropharynx was the most frequent site ( 41 %) , followed by cancer of the oral cavity ( 31 %) , larynx ( 22 %) , and hypopharynx ( 7 %). The prevalence ( and proportion) of potentially HPV-related cancers increased significantly over time with a mean of 0.78 additional case patient per year. The prevalence of HNSCC is modest compared with other cancers in HIV-infected individuals. The prevalence of oropharynx carcinoma , a potentially HPV-related carcinoma , seems to increase over time. Even if tobacco may be an important contributor , the role of HPV<pathogen> in HIV-infected individuals presenting with HNSCC should be investigated.
