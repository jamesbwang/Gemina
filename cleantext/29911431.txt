  This study aimed to ( 1) explore views of known experts leading on transition , ( 2) gather insights on the essential features of transitional care models and ( 3) highlight opportunities for and barriers to change: to inform core elements of benchmarks for transitional care. We held three workshops ( n = 20) and used a telephone interview ( n = 1) with health and social care professionals with expertise working with young people with a range of health conditions and disabilities. The workshops included individual brainstorming and group discussion. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. The general consensus from stakeholders ' discussions about transition was that ` things have become stuck '. Themes included: professionals ' attitudes towards and knowledge about young people and transition , organizational barriers and ` lack of joined-up thinking ' between services. Our work offers further insight into experts ' perceptions of transition services within the United Kingdom. It is clear that there is still much to be done to improve transition , to better meet the needs of young people and parents and begin to offer equitable access to transitional care programmes. The benchmarks offer a starting point for professionals seeking to improve transition through enabling the identification of gaps in services and providing a platform to share successful practice initiatives.
