  Our species have altered their surroundings since its early dispersion on Earth. Unfortunately , thanks to human-modified habitats , several pest organisms such as domiciliary insects have expanded their distributions. Moreover , pest-related microorganisms may also be aided by anthropization. Pest cockroaches are globally distributed and capable of carrying several diseases. We explored if urbanization may buffer environmental conditions allowing pest insects to expand their distribution. Specifically , we suggest that human settlements may generate suitable microhabitats for synanthropic cockroaches , helping them to survive and establish with disregard to overall climatic restrictions. To test this idea we studied the distribution of pest cockroaches spanning the length of Chilean territory. Chile , along its 4270 km length north to south extent , is a country offering a formidable sampling of Earth 's climatic diversity accompanied by dense urbanizations. We studied entomological collections and spatially analyzed pest cockroach distribution found in Chile and discovered that synanthropic cockroach populations are consistently concentrated near most urban developed zones of the country and not limited by overall temperature. Furthermore , health-concern pest cockroach species were widely distributed in Chilean territory , found even in its most southern urban centers as well as Easter Island. Therefore , these disease vectors could exist even in isolated and extreme climatic zones as long as urbanization provides the adequate microhabitat. We discuss the need for further research in order to assess if these distributions can be extrapolated to the pathogenic strains these pest insects may be carrying as reported in other regions of the planet.
