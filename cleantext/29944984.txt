  This retrospective claims database study examined healthcare utilization ( HCU) and costs associated with acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) in 237 elderly patients who received chemotherapy or a stem cell transplant ( SCT) following AML diagnosis. Patients with secondary AML were excluded. Over the entire follow-up period , 92.0 % of patients had ≥ 1 inpatient admission; 85.7 % had ≥ 1 AML-related admission , and 42.6 % had ≥ 1 non-AML-related admission. During inpatient admissions , 39.2 % of patients had ≥ 1 intensive care unit ( ICU) admission , with 20.7 % having ≥ 1 AML-related ICU admission , and 27.8 % having ≥ 1 non-AML-related ICU admission. Total mean per-patient per-month ( PPPM) costs over the follow-up period were $ 25,243 ( SD: $ 21,909) , with costs from Year 1 ( $ 27,756 ( SD: $ 22,121)) more than double those in Year 2 ( $ 12,953 ( SD: $ 26,334)) following AML diagnosis. The majority of total costs were medical ( $ 24,512 PPPM ( SD: $ 21,704)) , which included inpatient admissions ( $ 6548 PPPM ( SD: $ 10,777)) , other outpatient visits ( $ 5021 PPPM ( SD: $ 7997)) , supportive care ( $ 3640 PPPM ( SD: $ 5589) , and chemotherapy administration ( $ 2029 PPPM ( SD: $ 2345)). Healthcare costs of treated elderly AML patients are substantial , particularly in the first year following diagnosis. Further research is needed to understand factors contributing to high costs in various settings of care for elderly AML patients.
