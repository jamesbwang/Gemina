  Evidence-based guidance of clinical decision-making for the management of Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD) is lacking , particularly for co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. This review evaluates treatment evidence for six common symptom targets in children/adolescents with ASD and provides a resource to facilitate application of the evidence to clinical practice. A systematic search identified randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) and high-quality systematic reviews published between 2007 and 2016 , focused on: social interaction/communication impairment , stereotypic/repetitive behaviours , irritability/agitation , attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms , mood or anxiety<symptom> symptoms , and sleep difficulties. We then completed qualitative evaluation of high-quality systematic reviews/meta-analyses and quantitative evaluation of recently published RCTs not covered by prior comprehensive systematic reviews. Recently published RCTs focused on social interaction and communication impairment ( trials = 32) using psychosocial interventions. Interventions for irritability/agitation ( trials = 16) were mainly pharmacological. Few RCTs focused on other symptom targets ( trials = 2-5/ target). Integration of these results with our qualitative review indicated that few established treatment modalities exist , and available evidence is limited by small studies with high risk of bias. Given the current evidence-base , treatment targets must be clearly defined , and a systematic approach to intervention trials in children/adolescents with ASD must be undertaken with careful consideration of the limitations of safety/efficacy data.
