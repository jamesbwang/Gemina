  Customer mistreatment is becoming an important topic for work stress researchers and practitioners given the rise of service industry. Taking stressor-emotion-control perspectives , the authors examine day-level relationships between call center workers ' customer mistreatment experiences and their impaired recovery outcomes mediated by end-of-work negative affect. Furthermore , control concepts in the job and personal domains are tested as cross-level moderators. Specifically , job control and recovery self-efficacy are identified to reduce the within-person process of customer mistreatment affecting recovery outcomes. Seventy-one call center employees completed a registration survey and then two daily surveys over 2 consecutive weeks , yielding 481 time-lagged day-level observations. Multilevel path analyses show that customer mistreatment is positively associated with increased negative affect , which , in turn , predicts poor sleep quality at night and poor recovery state the next morning. Job control attenuates the day-level effect of customer mistreatment on negative affect , and recovery self-efficacy alleviates the day-level effects of negative affect on sleep quality and next-morning recovery state. The findings shed light on the recovery-impairing effects of customer mistreatment and its important boundary conditions. ( PsycINFO Database Record
