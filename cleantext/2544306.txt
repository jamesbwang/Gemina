  Osteosarcoma is an aggressive mesenchymal malignancy of the bone. Patient-derived models are essential tools for elucidating the molecular mechanisms associated with poor prognosis and the development of novel anticancer drugs. This study described the establishment of a patient-derived cancer model of osteosarcoma. Primary osteosarcoma tumor tissues were obtained from an osteosarcoma patient and inoculated in the skin of immunodeficient mice , followed by transplantation to other mice upon growth. Cells were maintained in monolayer cultures , and the capability of spheroid formation was assessed by seeding the cells on culture dishes. The invasion ability of cells was monitored by Matrigel assay , and genomic and proteomic backgrounds were examined by mass spectrometry. A cell line was established from patient-derived tumors and showed similar histology to that of the primary tumor tissue. Additionally , these cells formed spheroids on low-attachment tissue-culture dishes and exhibited invasive capabilities , and we confirmed that the genomic backgrounds were similar between patient-derived xenograft tumors and the cell line. Furthermore , the proteome of the patient-derived tumors and the cells exhibited similar , but not identical , patterns to that of the original tumor tissue. Our results indicated that this patient-derived xenograft model and cell line would be useful resources for osteosarcoma research.
