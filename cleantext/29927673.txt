  The Terrorist Radicalization Assessment Protocol ( TRAP-18) is a structured professional judgment instrument for threat assessment of the individual terrorist. It is a rationally derived theoretical model comprising eight proximal warning behaviors and 10 distal characteristics. Empirical research on the TRAP-18 is reviewed , including both nomothetic and idiographic studies of individual terrorists in both the United States and Europe. Mean interrater reliability is 0.895 ( Cohen 's kappa) , ranging from 0.69 to 1.0. Evidence of criterion validity has been demonstrated , including usefulness of the instrument across various extremist ideologies ( jihadism , ethnic nationalism , and single-issue) , and its ability to discriminate between thwarted and successful attackers. The instrument appears to advance the domain recommendations of Monahan ( 2012 , 2016) for the risk assessment of the individual terrorist. The TRAP-18 is further discussed as a threat assessment instrument for mental health clinicians. The limitations of the current research provide direction for further studies to assess its reliability and construct , discriminant , and predictive validity.
