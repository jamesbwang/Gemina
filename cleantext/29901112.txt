  Our previous study indicated that loureirin A induces hair follicle stem cell ( HFSC) differentiation through Wnt/β catenin signaling pathway activation. However , if and how microRNAs ( miRNAs/miRs) modulate loureirin A‑induced differentiation remains to be elucidated. In the present study , HFSCs were separated from the vibrissae of rats and identified by CD34 and keratin , type 1 cytoskeletal ( K) 15 expression. Microarray‑based miRNA profiling analysis revealed that miR‑339‑5p was downregulated in loureirin A‑induced HFSC differentiation. miR‑339‑5p overexpression by transfection with miR‑339‑5p mimics markedly inhibited the expression of K10 and involucrin , which are markers of epidermal differentiation , whereas inhibition of miR‑339‑5p by miR‑339‑5p inhibitor transfection promoted the expression of K10 and involucrin. These results suggest that miR‑339‑5p is a negative regulator of HFSC differentiation following induction by loureirin A. These findings were confirmed by a luciferase assay. Homeobox protein DLX‑5 ( DLX5) was identified as a direct target of miR‑339‑5p. Furthermore , it was demonstrated that miR‑339‑5p inhibited DLX5. Overexpression of miR‑339‑5p by mimic transfection significantly inhibited protein Wnt‑3a ( Wnt3a) expression , while inhibition of miR‑339‑5p by inhibitor transfection significantly increased the expression of Wnt3a. Furthermore , small interfering RNA targeting DLX5 was transfected into HFSCs , and western blot analysis revealed that Wnt3a , involucrin and K10 expression was significantly downregulated. Taken together , these results suggest that miR‑339‑5p negatively regulated loureirin A‑induced HFSC differentiation by targeting DLX5 , resulting in Wnt/β catenin signaling pathway inhibition. This may provide a possible therapeutic target for skin repair and regeneration.
