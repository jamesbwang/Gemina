  We sought to examine changes in regional and sex disparities in stunting , thinness , and overweight among Chinese school-aged children from 1985 to 2014. We analyzed data on 1,489,953 children aged 7-18 years in the Chinese National Survey on Students ' Constitution and Health. Stunting , thinness , and overweight were defined according to WHO anthropomorphic definitions. After adjustment for age , socioeconomic status , and school , logistic regression was used to estimate the prevalence of stunting , thinness , and overweight by region and sex over 30 years ' time. From 1985 to 2014 , the prevalence of stunting progressively decreased from 16.4 % in 1985 to 2.3 % in 2014 , thinness prevalence also declined overtime , from 8.4 to 4.0 % and overweight prevalence continually increased from 1.1 % in 1985 to 20.4 % in 2014 in Chinese school-aged children. Stunting and thinness were more common in rural areas , although urban/rural differences declined over time. Overweight was a greater problem in urban than rural areas , and this difference increased over time. Some provinces showed high levels of stunting , thinness , and overweight. The stunting prevalence of boys was higher than girls from 1985 and 1995 , but lower than girls for the past 15 years. Thinness was consistently more common in boys than girls across regions and time. Overweight continuously increased for boys and girls; however , the increase was more rapid in boys. Over the past 30 years , Chinese children have shifted in anthropomorphic measures indicating a shift from problems of under-nutrition to measures consistent with over-nutrition , particularly in urban areas and among boys. Some regions are burdened by problems of both under- and over-nutrition. Regional and sex-specific guidelines and public health policies for childhood nutrition are needed in China.
