  The current inability of clinical criteria to accurately identify the `` at-risk group '' for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS) development as well as its unknown etiology are fueling the interest in biomarkers aimed at completing clinical approaches for the diagnosis. The Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF) is a diffusible peptide critically involved in neuronal differentiation and survival. GDNF is largely studied in various neurological and neuromuscular diseases , with a great interest in the peripheral nervous system ( PNS). The recent discovery of Amyloid Precursor Protein ( APP)- dependent GDNF regulation driving neuro-muscular junctions ' formation in APP null transgenic mice , prompts to study whether neurodegeneration relies on loss or gain of APP function and suggests that it could affect peripheral processes. Here , we explored a brand-new aspect of the loss of trophic support in ALS by measuring GDNF , APP , soluble APP fragments and AÎ² peptides levels in SOD1
