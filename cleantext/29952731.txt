  This study fills a gap in the literature by examining the relationship between two types of narcissism , vulnerable and grandiose , and five alcohol-related outcomes ( i.e. , alcohol use , alcohol problems , evaluation and expectancies of problems , and readiness to change). 345 college students ( 28 % male , 72 % female) from a Midwestern university were recruited from undergraduate psychology courses from April 2015 to October 2016. Participants completed an online survey with questionnaires measuring the variables of interest. Multiple regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Grandiose narcissism was a positive predictor of alcohol consumption and a positive ( i.e. , good) evaluation of alcohol-related problems. Vulnerable narcissism was a positive predictor of alcohol-related problems , problem recognition ( i.e. , readiness to change) , and problem expectancies. The results speak to the effects that different types of narcissism have on alcohol use , alcohol problems and attitudes towards alcohol problems among young adults.
