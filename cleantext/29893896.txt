  We have previously shown that 5 ' halves from tRNAGlyGCC and tRNAGluCUC are the most enriched small RNAs in the extracellular space of human cell lines , and especially in the non-vesicular fraction. Extracellular RNAs are believed to require protection by either encapsulation in vesicles or ribonucleoprotein complex formation. However , deproteinization of non-vesicular tRNA halves does not affect their retention in size-exclusion chromatography. Thus , we considered alternative explanations for their extracellular stability. In-silico analysis of the sequence of these tRNA-derived fragments showed that tRNAGly 5 ' halves can form homodimers or heterodimers with tRNAGlu 5 ' halves. This capacity is virtually unique to glycine tRNAs. By analyzing synthetic oligonucleotides by size exclusion chromatography , we provide evidence that dimerization is possible in vitro. tRNA halves with single point substitutions preventing dimerization are degraded faster both in controlled nuclease digestion assays and after transfection in cells , showing that dimerization can stabilize tRNA halves against the action of cellular nucleases. Finally , we give evidence supporting dimerization of endogenous tRNAGlyGCC 5 ' halves inside cells. Considering recent reports have shown that 5 ' tRNA halves from Ala and Cys can form tetramers , our results highlight RNA intermolecular structures as a new layer of complexity in the biology of tRNA-derived fragments.
