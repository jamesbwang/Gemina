  Although endoscopic cyanoacrylate glue injection ( ECGI) is recommended as first-line treatment for bleeding gastric varices ( GV) there is still limited experience with this method in the US. Our aim was to analyze our 10-year experience of ECGI for treatment and prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding. Records of patients undergoing ECGI of GV at our US tertiary care center between 6/2005 and 5/2015 were reviewed. Assessed outcomes were primary hemostasis , early rebleeding during hospitalization , recurrent bleeding during follow-up , eradication and recurrence of GV. Prophylactic ECGI was performed in 16 patients with large GV. Eradication was achieved in 15 ( 94 %). During the median follow-up of 27 ( IQR 7-47) months , 4 patients ( 26.6 %) had variceal bleeding; all were treated successfully with ECGI. Fifty-seven patients underwent ECGI for GV bleeding. Primary hemostasis was achieved in all. Early rebleeding occurred in 2 ( 3.5 %) and durable hemostasis could not be achieved. Follow-up beyond initial hospitalization was available in 41 patients. Bleeding recurred in 8 ( 19.5 %) patients during a median follow-up of 12 ( IQR , 3-51) months. Eradication of GV was achieved in 92 % of patients but recurrent varices were found in 44 % during a median follow up period of 33 months. ECGI is effective in achieving hemostasis of bleeding GV and their eradication. Recurrent bleeding and recurrence of varices after complete obliteration however are not infrequent and continued surveillance is advisable.
