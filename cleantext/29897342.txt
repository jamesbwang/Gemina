  As quantitative susceptibility mapping ( QSM) is maturing , more clinical applications are being explored. With this comes the question whether QSM is sufficiently robust and reproducible to be directly used in a clinical setting where patients are possibly not cooperative and/or unable to suppress involuntary<symptom> movements<symptom> sufficiently. Twenty-nine patients with Alzheimer 's disease , 31 patients with mild cognitive impairment and 41 healthy controls were scanned on a 3 T scanner , including a multi-echo gradient-echo sequence for QSM and an inversion-prepared segmented gradient-echo sequence ( T1-TFE , MPRAGE). The severity of motion artifacts ( excessive/strong/noticeable/ invisible) was categorized via visual inspection by two independent raters. Quantitative susceptibility was reconstructed using ` joint background-field removal and segmentation-enhanced dipole inversion ' , based on segmented subcortical gray-matter regions , as well as using ` morphology enabled dipole inversion '. Statistical analysis of the susceptibility maps was performed per region. A large fraction of the data showed motion artifacts , visible in both magnitude images and susceptibility maps. No statistically significant susceptibility differences were found between groups including motion-affected data. Considering only subjects without visible motion , significant susceptibility differences were observed in caudate nucleus as well as in putamen. Motion-effects can obscure statistically significant differences in QSM between patients and controls. Additional measures to restrict and/or compensate for subject motion should be taken for QSM in standard clinical settings to avoid risk of false findings.
