  Cell type-specific transcriptome analysis is an essential tool for understanding biological processes in which diverse types of cells are involved. Although cell isolation methods such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS) in combination with transcriptome analysis have widely been used so far , their time-consuming and harsh procedures limit their applications. Here , we report a novel
