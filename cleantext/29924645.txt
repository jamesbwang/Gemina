  The aim of our study was to investigate possible associations between three SNPs: rs4673 in the CYBA gene; rs1041740 in the SOD1 gene; and rs1001179 in the CAT gene , and type 1 diabetes ( T1D) or diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN) in T1D patients. Allelic variants of the selected SNPs were determined by allelic discrimination assays in 114 T1D patients enrolled in the study group and in 90 healthy individuals from a control group. Associations between each of the three SNPs were tested in subgroups of T1D patients divided according to the presence of DPN. The TT genotype of rs4673 in the CYBA gene was associated with DPN in T1D patients ( OR 4.997 , 95 % CI 1.403-19.083 , p = 0.016). Weak significance was observed for a protective effect of the TT genotype of rs1041740 in the SOD1 gene relative to T1D development ( OR 0.318 , 95 % CI 0.092-0.959 , p = 0.056). There was no significant association between the CAT gene SNP rs1001179 and T1D or DPN. We showed a strong association of the CYBA polymorphism rs4673 with DPN in Slovak children and adolescents with T1D. Further studies are necessary to assess the relationship between rs1041740 and T1D or DPN.
