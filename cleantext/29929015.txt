  Infection is a common complication of major lower limb-sparing surgery with massive total knee prosthesis ( MTKP) reconstruction after extensive tumour resection. When free tissue transfer is required to cover the prosthesis , musculo-cutaneous flaps are usually preferred based on proven efficacy when used in both one-stage and two-stage procedures. The use of a free fascio-cutaneous antero-lateral thigh ( FC-ALT) flap in 3 patients with infected knee reconstructions is reported here. A retrospective study was performed of 3 patients in whom a free FC-ALT flap was used during a two-stage procedure to treat MTKP infection after femoral sarcoma<disease> resection. Free FC-ALT flap transfer and exchange arthroplasty were successful in all 3 patients. Two years after the procedure , no patient had required amputation or experienced recurrent infection. A free FC-ALT flap can provide adequate coverage of infected MTKP and deserves to be viewed as a valid alternative to free muscle flaps.
