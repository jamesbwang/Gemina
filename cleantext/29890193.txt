  Strategies for biotechnology must take account of opportunities for research , innovation and business growth. At a regional level , public-private collaborations provide potential for such growth and the creation of centres of excellence. By considering recent progress in areas such as genomics , healthcare diagnostics , synthetic biology , gene editing and bio-digital technologies , opportunities for smart , strategic and specialised investment are discussed. These opportunities often involve convergent or disruptive technologies , combining for example elements of pharma-science , molecular biology , bioinformatics and novel device development to enhance biotechnology and the life sciences. Analytical applications use novel devices in mobile health , predictive diagnostics and stratified medicine. Synthetic biology provides opportunities for new product development and increased efficiency for existing processes. Successful centres of excellence should promote public-private business partnerships , clustering and global collaborations based on excellence , smart strategies and innovation if they are to remain sustainable in the longer term.
