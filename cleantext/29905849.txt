  Zic family genes encode C2H2-type zinc finger proteins that act as critical toolkit proteins in the metazoan body plan establishment. In this study , we searched evolutionarily conserved domains among 121 Zic protein sequences from 22 animal phyla and 40 classes , and addressed their evolutionary significance. The collected sequences included those from poriferans and orthonectids. We discovered seven new conserved domains ( CDs) , CD0-CD6 , ( in order from the N- to C-terminus) using the most conserved Zic protein sequences from Deuterostomia ( Hemichordata , Cephalochordata) , Lophotrochozoa ( Cephalopoda and Brachiopoda) , and Ecdysozoa ( Chelicerata , Priapulida). Subsequently , we analyzed the evolutionary history of Zic CDs including the known CDs ( ZOC , ZFD , ZFNC , and ZFCC). All Zic CDs are predicted to have existed in a bilaterian ancestor. During evolution , they have degenerated in a taxa-selective manner with significant correlations among CDs. The N terminal CD ( CD0) was largely lost , but was observed in Brachiopoda , Priapulida , Hemichordata , Echinodermata , and Cephalochordata , and the C terminal CD ( CD6) was highly conserved in conserved-type-Zic possessing taxa , but was truncated in vertebrate Zic gene paralogues ( Zic1/2/3) , generating a vertebrate-specific C-terminus critical for transcriptional regulation. ZOC was preferentially conserved in insects and in an anthozoan paralogue , and it was bound to the homeodomain transcription factor Msx in a phylogenetically conserved manner. Accordingly , the extent of divergence of Msx and Zic CDs from their respective bilaterian ancestors is strongly correlated. These results suggest that coordinated divergence among the toolkit CDs and among toolkit proteins is involved in the divergence of metazoan body plans.
