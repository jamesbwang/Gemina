  Syntaphilin ( SNPH) inhibits the movement of mitochondria in tumor cells , preventing their accumulation at the cortical cytoskeleton and limiting the bioenergetics of cell motility and invasion. Although this may suppress metastasis , the regulation of the SNPH pathway is not well understood. Using a global proteomics screen , we show that SNPH associates with multiple regulators of ubiquitin-dependent responses and is ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase CHIP ( or STUB1) on Lys111 and Lys153 in the microtubule-binding domain. SNPH ubiquitination did not result in protein degradation , but instead anchored SNPH on tubulin to inhibit mitochondrial motility and cycles of organelle fusion and fission i.e. dynamics. Expression of ubiquitination-defective SNPH mutant Lys111 → Arg or Lys153 → Arg increased the speed and distance traveled by mitochondria , repositioned mitochondria to the cortical cytoskeleton , and supported heightened tumor chemotaxis , invasion , and metastasis in vivo. Interference with SNPH ubiquitination activated mitochondrial dynamics , resulting in increased recruitment of the fission regulator dynamin-related protein-1 ( Drp1) to mitochondria , and Drp1-dependent tumor cell motility. These data uncover non-degradative ubiquitination of SNPH as a key regulator of mitochondrial trafficking and tumor cell motility and invasion. In this way , SNPH may function as a unique , ubiquitination-regulated suppressor of metastasis.
