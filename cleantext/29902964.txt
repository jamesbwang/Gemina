  The Australian standards of care and treatment guidelines aim to maximise quality care provision to transgender and gender diverse ( TGD) children and adolescents across Australia , while recognising the unique circumstances of providing such care to this population. Recommendations are made based on available empirical evidence and clinician consensus , and have been developed in consultation with Australian professionals from multiple disciplines working with the TGD population , TGD support organisations , as well as TGD children and adolescents and their families. Main recommendations: Recommendations include general principles for supporting TGD children and adolescents using an affirmative approach , separate guidelines for the care of pre-pubertal children and TGD adolescents , as well as discipline-based recommendations for mental health care , medical and surgical interventions , fertility preservation , and speech therapy. Changes in management as a result of this statement: Although published international treatment guidelines currently exist , challenges in accessing and providing TGD health care specific to Australia have not been addressed to date. In response to this , these are the first guidelines to be developed for TGD children and adolescents in Australia. These guidelines also move away from treatment recommendations based on chronological age , with recommended timing of medical transition and surgical interventions dependent on the adolescent 's capacity and competence to make informed decisions , duration of time on puberty suppression , coexisting mental health and medical issues , and existing family support.
