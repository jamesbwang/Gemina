  Residue interaction networks ( RINs) have been shown to be relevant representations of the tertiary or quaternary structures of proteins , in particular thanks to network centrality analyses. We recently developed the RINspector Cytoscape app , which couples centrality analyses with backbone flexibility predictions. This combined approach permits the identification of crucial residues for the folding or function of the protein that can constitute good targets for mutagenesis experiments. Here we present an application programming interface ( API) for RINspector that enables interplay between Cytoscape , RINspector and external languages , such as R or Python. This API provides easy access to batch centrality calculations and flexibility predictions , and allows for the easy comparison of results between different structures. These comparisons can lead to the identification of specific and conserved central residues , and show the impact of mutations to these and other residues on the flexibility of the proteins. We give two use cases to demonstrate the interest of these functionalities and provide the corresponding scripts: the first concerns NMR conformers , the second focuses on mutations in a structure.
