  By using data from multiple instruments , we investigate ionospheric/thermospheric behavior during the period from 21 to 23 June 2015 , when three interplanetary shocks<disease> ( IS) of different intensities arrived at Earth. The first IS was registered at 16:45 UT on 21 June and caused ~ 50 nT increase in the SYM-H index. The second IS arrived at 5:45 UT on 22 June and induced an enhancement of the auroral/substorm activity that led to rapid increase of thermospheric neutral mass density and ionospheric vertical total electron content at high latitudes. Several hours later , topside electron content and electron density increased at low latitudes on the nightside. The third and much larger IS arrived at 18:30 UT on 22 June and initiated a major geomagnetic storm that lasted for many hours. The storm provoked significant effects in the thermosphere and ionosphere on both dayside and nightside. In the thermosphere , the dayside neutral mass density exceeded the quiet time levels by 300-500 % , with stronger effects in the summer hemisphere. In the ionosphere , both positive and negative storm effects were observed on both dayside and nightside. We compared the ionospheric observations with simulations by the coupled Sami3 is Also a Model of the Ionosphere/Rice Convection Model ( SAMI3/RCM) model. We find rather good agreement between the data and the model for the first phase of the storm , when the prompt penetration electric field ( PPEF) was the principal driver. At the end of the storm main phase , when the ionospheric effects were , most likely , driven by a combination of PPEF and thermospheric winds , the modeling results agree less with the observations.
