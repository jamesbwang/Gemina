  The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of gait training with virtual reality ( VR) on mobility in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD). Thirty-seven individuals with PD were allocated to three groups ( control = 12 , VR = 12 and treadmill = 13) submitted to 12 twenty-minute training sessions. Evaluations involved the Timed Up and Go ( TUG) test before the intervention , after one session , after all 12 sessions and 30 days after the end of the intervention. The groups submitted to VR and treadmill training took less time to execute the TUG test than the control group. Individuals with PD submitted to VR and treadmill gait training presented mobility improvements in comparison to traditional physiotherapeutic training.
