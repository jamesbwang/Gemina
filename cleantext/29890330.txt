  Functional mapping of cerebral blood volume ( CBV) changes has the potential to reveal brain activity with high localization specificity at the level of cortical layers and columns. Non-invasive CBV imaging using Vascular Space Occupancy ( VASO) at ultra-high magnetic field strengths promises high spatial specificity but poses unique challenges in human applications. As such , 9.4 T B
