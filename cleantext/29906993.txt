  The present paper deals with a fiber bundle model which consists of a fraction α of infinitely strong fibers. The inclusion of such an unbreakable fraction has been proven to affect the failure process in early studies , especially around a critical value α _ ( c). The present work has a twofold purpose: ( i) a study of failure abruptness , mainly the brittle to quasibrittle transition point with varying α and ( ii) variation of α _ ( c) as we change the strength of disorder introduced in the model. The brittle to quasibrittle transition is confirmed from the failure abruptness. On the other hand , the α _ ( c) is obtained from the knowledge of failure abruptness as well as the statistics of avalanches. It is observed that the brittle to quasibrittle transition point scales to lower values , suggesting more quasi-brittle-like continuous<symptom> failure<symptom> when α is increased. At the same time , the bundle becomes stronger as there are larger numbers of strong links to support the external stress. High α in a highly disordered bundle leads to an ideal situation where the bundle strength , as well as the predictability in failure process is very high. Also , the critical fraction α _ ( c) , required to make the model deviate from the conventional results , increases with decreasing strength of disorder. The analytical expression for α _ ( c) shows good agreement with the numerical results. Finally , the findings in the paper are compared with previous results and real-life applications of composite materials.
