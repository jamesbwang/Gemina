  Tau pathology in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) includes hyperphosphorylation and truncation of tau. Phosphorylation at S422 is found to suppress truncation of tau at D421 that leading to the generation of ΔTau. However , the interrelation between hyperphosphorylation and generation of ΔTau in AD remains elusive. In current study , staurosporine ( Stau) induced ΔTau generation by caspases in SH-SY5Y cells with tau overexpression was found to be accompanied by a dramatic dephosphorylation at S422 and the epitope of the diagnostic antibody AT8 ( S199 + S202 + T205) , but a moderate dephosphorylation of PHF1 ( S396 + S404) epitope. Therefore , to explore the effect of AT8 epitope on tau truncation , the residues in AT8 epitope were mutated to produce `` pseudo-phosphorylated '' ( AT8E) or `` pseudo-unphosphorylated '' ( AT8A) tau constructs. With Stau treatment , the generation of ΔTau from tau-AT8E was significantly attenuated comparing with that from tau-AT8A , which was S422-independent in that addition of S422A mutation still preserved this effect. Interestingly , this modulatory effect was able to be reversed by addition of PHF1E mutation. Moreover , treating the crude tau extracts with recombinant caspase-3 in vitro , also showed that ΔTau level was suppressed by AT8E , and potentiated by AT8E + PHF1E. The results primarily revealed the modulating effects of phosphorylation on ΔTau generation which may have potential implications in tau pathological processes and therapeutic intervention.
