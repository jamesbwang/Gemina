  It may happen under the conditions employed that enantiomers interconvert to each other. In this case , obviously , the kinetics of the process is to be examined. When enantiomers dynamically interconvert to each other during the separation process , a plateau is observed between the adjacent peaks ( so-called Batman peak appears). The peak shape depends on the rate constant of this dynamic reaction. A novel stochastic model was derived which takes both the separation and the interconversion into account at the molecular level- thus the effects of the parameters affecting the separation can be investigated. The novel model was used for the study of quetiapine , a drug molecule that interconverts during the separation to evaluate the rate constant based on the enantiomerization. Various flow rates and temperatures were used , and good agreement was obtained with the rate constant obtained from optical rotation experiments and with the software written by Trapp ( 1). The most important result we concluded is the need of mild conditions during the separation to ascertain the rate constant the most accurately ( low flow rates and temperatures where the enantiomerization process is limited to a few interconversions). The comparison of the rate constants of the on-column and the off-column experiments should be done by considering the stationary phase effects that are absent in the off-column experiments.
