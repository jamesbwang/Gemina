  Morphological organ regeneration following acute tissue loss is common among lower vertebrates , but is rarely observed in mammalian postnatal life. Adult liver regeneration after 70 % partial hepatectomy results in hepatocyte hypertrophy with some replication in remaining lobes with restoration of metabolic activity , but with permanent loss of the injured lobe 's morphology and architecture. Here , we detail a new surgical method in the neonate that leaves a physiologic environment conducive to regeneration. This model involves amputation of the left lobe apex and a subsequent conservative management regimen , and lacks the necessity for ligation of major liver vessels or chemical injury , leaving a physiologic environment where regeneration may occur. We extend this protocol to amputations on juvenile ( P7-14) mice , during which the injured liver transitions from organ regeneration to compensatory growth by hypertrophy. The presented , brief 30 min protocol provides a framework to study the mechanisms of regeneration , its age-associated decline in mammals , and the characterization of putative hepatic stem or progenitors.
