  Dysregulated anger is often present in the emotional ( i.e. , anxiety<symptom> , mood , and related) disorders; however , it is rarely targeted in treatment. Transdiagnostic treatments , which focus on processes that contribute to dysregulated emotions across the range of psychopathology , might represent an efficient way to treat this anger. Using a subset of data from a recently completed equivalency trial comparing the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders ( UP) to single diagnosis protocols ( SDPs) for specific disorders , this study began exploring whether the UP led to great reductions in anger compared with the SDPs. Results indicated that there was a small , nonsignificant , decrease in anger in the UP condition , whereas there was a moderate , nonsignificant increase in anger in the SDP condition. At posttreatment , UP patients had significantly lower anger scores than patients who received an SDP. These preliminary results suggest that transdiagnostic treatments may be well poised to target dyregulated anger in the context of emotional disorders.
