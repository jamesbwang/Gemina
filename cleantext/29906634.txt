  A new dipole field inversion method for whole head quantitative susceptibility mapping ( QSM) is proposed. Instead of performing background field removal and local field inversion sequentially , the proposed method performs dipole field inversion directly on the total field map in a single step. To aid this under-determined and ill-posed inversion process and obtain robust QSM images , Tikhonov regularization is implemented to seek the local susceptibility solution with the least-norm ( LN) using the L-curve criterion. The proposed LN-QSM does not require brain edge erosion , thereby preserving the cerebral cortex in the final images. This should improve its applicability for QSM-based cortical grey matter measurement , functional imaging and venography of full brain. Furthermore , LN-QSM also enables susceptibility mapping of the entire head without the need for brain extraction , which makes QSM reconstruction more automated and less dependent on intermediate pre-processing methods and their associated parameters. It is shown that the proposed LN-QSM method reduced errors in a numerical phantom simulation , improved accuracy in a gadolinium phantom experiment , and suppressed artefacts in nine subjects , as compared to two-step and other single-step QSM methods. Measurements of deep grey matter and skull susceptibilities from LN-QSM are consistent with established reconstruction methods.
