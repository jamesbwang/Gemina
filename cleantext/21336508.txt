  Safe excision of spinal cord tumors depends on sufficient visualization of the tumor and surrounding structures. In patients with spinal cord tumor adjacent to a stenotic spinal canal , extensive bony decompression proximal and distal to the tumor should be considered for safer excision of the tumor. Extensive wide laminectomy is one choice for such cases , but postoperative problems such as kyphotic deformity remain a concern. A 76-year-old man and a 60-year-old woman presented with symptomatic intradural extramedullary spinal cord tumors in the cervical spine. Both patients showed a combination of spondylotic changes in the cervical spine and stenotic condition at the level of the tumor. Both tumors were successfully resected through open-door laminoplasty with hydroxyapatite ( HA) spacers , with the tumor located on the side of the laminoplasty. Histological diagnosis was schwannoma for both tumors. HA spacers completely bonded to the host bone and did not interfere with postoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) of the inside of the spinal canal. Cervical spine alignment was maintained at the final follow-up of 6 years in both cases. Laminoplasty with HA spacers enabled successful tumor extirpation , reliable MRI follow-up after surgery , and maintenance of normal cervical spine alignment. Laminoplasty with HA spacers represents a good option for the treatment of cervical spinal cord tumor in patients combined with spinal stenosis.
