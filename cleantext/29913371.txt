  A straightforward , highly efficient , and low-cost biological route was introduced for the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles. Three urease-positive bacteria namely , Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> , B. pasteurii , and B.<pathogen> licheniformis<pathogen> were used to biosynthesize ammonia<pathogen> and biosurfactants required for the nanoparticle production. Also , the features of the applied biological approach was compared with a chemical co-precipitation method. X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , field emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE-SEM) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) , dynamic light scattering ( DLS) , vibrating-sample magnetometer ( VSM) , and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR) were applied to characterize the synthesized nanoparticles. Results indicated that the biologically fabricated powders had a single domain structure , and their mean particle size was in the range of 37 to 97 nm. The production capacity of the biological processes was double the chemical method , and the biosynthesized superparamagnetic nanoparticles had higher saturation magnetization up to 132 emu/g. Finally , the removal of Cr ( VI) from a synthetic solution was investigated using the four products. The maximum elimination of chromium ( over 99 %) was achieved by the particles synthesized by B. pasteurii , with the adsorption capacity of 190 mg/g.
