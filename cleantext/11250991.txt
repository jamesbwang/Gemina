  Malignant germ cell tumors ( GCT) of the ovary account for 2-3 % of all ovarian neoplasms and occur mostly in the second and third decade of life. Over the past three decades , survival rates for germ cell tumors have dramatically improved , coincident with more aggressive surgical staging and combination chemotherapy. Although there are several studies describing ovarian GCT and fertility-preserving surgery in the western population , there is very little Indian data. We present our experience of germ cell tumor ovary in the Department of Surgical Oncology , King George 's Medical University over the last 5 years with special emphasis on treatment outcome and role of fertility preservation surgery. A retrospective review of medical records of patients with ovarian germ cell tumors , treated at our center from January 2012 to December 2016 , was performed. Epidemiological and clinical profile of patients was reviewed. Clinical stage of presentation , neoadjuvant treatment , surgical treatment , and adjuvant treatment data were analyzed , and treatment outcome data was recorded. Patient follow-up was done to ascertain disease-free interval , treatment outcome , ability to conceive following fertility-preserving surgery , and quality of life. A total of 39 patients with ovarian germ cell tumor were treated during this period. Their median age at diagnosis was 22 years ( range 11-65 years) and most common mode of presentation was abdominal lump without ascites. Around 36.8 % (
