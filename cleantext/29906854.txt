  A self-consistent kinetic theory of Thomson scattering of an electromagnetic field by a nonuniform plasma is derived. We show that not only the imaginary part , but also the time and space derivatives of the real part of the dielectric susceptibility determine the amplitude and the width of the Thomson scattering spectral lines. As a result of inhomogeneity , these properties become asymmetric with respect to inversion of the sign of the frequency. Our theory provides a method of a remote probing and measurement of electron density gradients in plasma; this is based on the demonstrated asymmetry of the Thomson scattering lines.
