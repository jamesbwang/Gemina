  Long working hours are recognized as a risk factor for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases ( CCVD). We investigated the relationship between working hours and different CCVD severity outcomes-death , disability , and illness-across industries in Taiwan from 2006 to 2016. We applied a generalized additive mixed model to estimate the association between working hours and the rate of each severity outcome , adjusted for salary , unemployment rate , time , and a random intercept. Industry-average working hours were significantly associated with each outcome level of overwork-related CCVD , especially when monthly working hours increased from 169 ( relative risk ( RR) = 1.46 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.002-2.12) to 187 ( RR = 5.73 , 95 % CI 3.61-9.08). Although RR trends declined after monthly working hours exceeded 187 , excess risks remained statistically significant. Each 1-hour increase in working hours had a stronger effect on the RR increase in death and disability than on illness. Variations in CCVD risks existed across industries , with the highest risk in transportation and information. Reducing working hours is essential to preventing overwork-related CCVD , especially the more severe outcomes. We recommend further research to address possible underreporting of less severe cases , and to explore actions to narrow the gaps in risk across industries.
