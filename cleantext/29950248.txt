  Myelodysplastic syndromes<disease> ( MDS) comprise a group of malignant hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC) disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis. The risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) is increasing. The initiating event in HSC of MDS leads to a growth advantage and subsequent clonal expansion , that is still poorly understood. Accumulating data indicate that the mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) in MDS model display aberrant characteristics contributing to disease initiation and transformation into AML. MSC derived from MDS displayed the alteration in genetics , epigenetics and gene expression , which contribute to altered morphology , impaired proliferative and differentiation capacity and perturbed cytokine secretions , thus destroy in their ability to support normal hematopoiesis and contribute to malignant progression. A number of promising agents that target the interactions of the MDS clone with MSC are currently investigated in various phases of clinical trial , that might ultimately result in novel therapeutic strategies , targeting niche cells to attenuate leukemic progression. In this article , the current status of MDS treatment , the characteristics of MDS-MSC senescence and phenotypes , the changes of hematopoietic function sapported by senescent MDS-MSC , the significane of MDS-MSC in MDS prognosis and the MDS-MSC as potential target for treatment of MDS are summarized.
