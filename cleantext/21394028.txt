  Prior studies have proposed several electrocardiogram ( ECG) criteria in limb leads for identifying the culprit coronary artery ( CCA) in patients with acute inferior wall myocardial infarction ( IWMI). The aim of our study was to conduct an evidence-based evaluation and test accuracy comparison of these criteria. We searched the PubMed , Embase , and Ovid. Eligible studies to assess the diagnostic performance of ECG criteria predicting CCA in IWMI were reviewed for inclusion. A diagnostic meta-analysis of bivariate approach was performed for pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity , and meta-regression was implemented to investigate sources of heterogeneity. Twenty-four studies with 4431 unique participants met the inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for ST-segment elevation ( STE) in III > II , ST-segment depression<symptom> ( STD) in I , STD in aVL , STD in aVL > I , STE in III > II , and STD in aVL > I were 0.91 ( 0.88-0.94) and 0.69 ( 0.53-0.81) , 0.80 ( 0.73-0.87) and 0.69 ( 0.62-0.76) , 0.90 ( 0.81-0.95) and 0.41 ( 0.22-0.62) , 0.84 ( 0.75-0.91) and 0.72 ( 0.48-0.88) , and 0.79 ( 0.62-0.90) and 1.00 ( 0.37-1.00) , respectively. Heterogeneity investigation showed that whether multi-vessel diseased patients were excluded , sample size , publication year , etc. , could influence the diagnostic performance. STE in III > II performed better than other criteria for predicting RCA as CCA in IWMI , and STE in III > II and STD in aVL > I were potential and simple algorithms. ECG could be an effective tool to identify the CCA , but future studies are clearly needed to address the potential of diagnostic and prognostic value.
