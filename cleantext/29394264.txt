  We sought to confirm the presence and frequency of B cells and Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV) ( latent and lytic phase) antigens in archived MS and non-MS brain tissue by immunohistochemistry. We quantified the type and location of B-cell subsets within active and chronic MS brain lesions<symptom> in relation to viral antigen expression. The presence of EBV-infected cells was further confirmed by in situ hybridization to detect the EBV RNA transcript , EBV-encoded RNA-1 ( EBER-1). We report the presence of EBV latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP-1) in 93 % of MS and 78 % of control brains , with a greater percentage of MS brains containing CD138 Together , our observations suggest an uncharacterized link between the EBV virus life cycle and MS pathogenesis.
