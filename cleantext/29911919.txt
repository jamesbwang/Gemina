  Background and purpose- Pes cavovarus ( PCV) is a complex deformity , frequently related to neurological conditions and associated with foot pain , callosities , and walking instability. The deformity has the tendency to increase during growth. Orthotic treatment is ineffective and surgery may be troublesome. We present the preliminary results of a new mini-invasive surgical technique for correction of this foot deformity. Patients and methods- We operated on 13 children ( 24 feet) , age 7-13 years. In 7 children the deformity was neurological in origin. The surgical technique included a dorsal hemiepiphysiodesis of the 1st metatarsal , and a plantar fascia release. The clinical deformity , hindfoot flexibility , and foot callosities , together with a radiological assessment ( Meary angle , calcaneal pitch , and talo-calcaneal angle) , was done pre- and postoperatively. At final check-up , after a median of 28 months ( 12-40) , the Oxford Ankle Foot Questionnaire for children ( OXAFQ-C) was used to assess patient satisfaction. The primary outcome was the hindfoot varus correction. Results- All the operated feet improved clinically and radiologically. Heel varus improved from a mean 6 ° preoperatively to 5 ° valgus postoperatively. In those children where treatment was initiated at a younger age , full correction was achieved. Footwear always improved. Interpretation- This treatment may offer a less aggressive alternative in the treatment of PCV in young children and may eventually reduce the amount of surgery needed in the future.
