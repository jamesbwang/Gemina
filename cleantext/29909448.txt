  Bisecting GlcNAc , a branch structure in N-glycan , has unique functions and is involved in several diseases including Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). In this review , we provide an overview of the biosynthesis of bisecting GlcNAc and its physiological and pathological functions , particularly in the nervous system where bisecting GlcNAc is most highly expressed. The biosynthetic enzyme of bisecting GlcNAc is N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III ( GnT-III). Overexpression , knockdown , and knockout of GnT-III have so far revealed various functions of bisecting GlcNAc , which are mediated by regulating the functions of key carrier proteins. GnT-III-deficient AD model mice showed reduced amyloid-β ( Aβ) accumulation in the brain by suppressing the function of a key Aβ-generating enzyme , β-site APP-cleaving enzyme-1 ( BACE1) , and greatly improved AD pathology. Altered BACE1 subcellular localization in GnT-III-deficient cells , from early endosomes to lysosomes , suggests that bisecting GlcNAc serves as a trafficking tag for the movement of modified proteins to an endosomal compartment. For therapeutic application , we have employed high-throughput screening to search for GnT-III inhibitors. These findings highlight the importance of bisecting GlcNAc modification in the nervous system.
