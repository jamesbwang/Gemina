  Additional and comorbid diagnoses are common among suicide victims with major depressive disorder ( MDD) and have been shown to increase the suicide risk. The aim of the present study was first , to investigate whether patients with severe depression/melancholia who had died by suicide showed more additional psychiatric disorders than a matched control group. Second , general rates of comorbid and additional diagnoses in the total group of patients were estimated and compared with literature on MDD. A blind record evaluation was performed on 100 suicide victims with severe depression/melancholia ( MDD with melancholic and/or psychotic features: MDD-M/P) and matched controls admitted to the Department of Psychiatry , Lund , Sweden between 1956 and 1969 and monitored to 2010. Diagnoses in addition to severe<symptom> depression<symptom> were noted. Less than half of both the suicides and controls had just one psychiatric disorder ( 47 % in the suicide and 46 % in the control group). The average number of diagnoses was 1.80 and 1.82 , respectively. Additional diagnoses were not related to an increased suicide risk. Anxiety<symptom> was the most common diagnosis. Occurrence of suspected schizophrenia/schizotypal or additional obsessive-compulsive symptoms were more common than expected , but alcohol use disorders did not appear very frequent. The known increased risk of suicide in MDD with comorbid/additional diagnoses does not seem to apply to persons with MDD-M/P ( major depressive disorder-depression/Melancholia). Some diagnoses , such as schizophrenia/schizotypal disorders , were more frequent than expected , which is discussed , and a genetic overlap with MDD-M/P is proposed.
