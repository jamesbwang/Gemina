  The question posed today is not whether the cerebellum plays a role in cognition , but instead , how the cerebellum contributes to cognitive processes , even in the developmental age. The central role of the cerebellum in many areas of human abilities , motor as well as cognitive , in childhood as well as in adulthood , is well established but cerebellar basic functioning is still not clear and is much debated. Of particular interest is the changing face of cerebellar influence on motor , higher cognitive , and behavioral functioning when adult and developmental lesions<symptom> are compared. The idea that the cerebellum might play quite different roles during development and in adulthood has been proposed , and evidence from experimental and clinical literature has been provided , including for sequencing , behavioral aspects , and executive functions Still , more data are needed to fully understand the changes of cerebrocerebellar interactions within the segregated loops which connect cerebrum and cerebellum , not only between childhood and adulthood but also in health and disease.
