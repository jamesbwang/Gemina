 : Known to cause important metabolic disturbances , weight gain becomes a major health problem after smoking cessation. Visceral adiposity index ( VAI) is becoming increasingly popular in the detection of cardiometabolic risks in several disorders and general population. Here , we aimed to investigate the effects of quitting smoking on VAI levels.: Of 350 participants included into the cigarette cessation program , 70 ( 20 %) completed the study and were enrolled into the analyses. VAI levels were calculated at the baseline and 3: Thirty-eight ( 54.3 %) out of 70 participants were male. While the mean age was found as 42 ± 1.0 years , mean starting age of smoking was found to be 16.87 ± 0.45 years , and mean smoking time was 23.07 ± 1.18 years. While VAI levels were found higher in men at the baseline , VAI levels were found similar in both genders at the end of the study. Higher VAI levels were found in those smoking > 20 cigarettes/day , compared to those smoking ≤ 20 cigarettes/day. Although weight , waist circumference , body mass index ( BMI) , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased , VAI levels were found to decrease significantly at the 3 Although body<symptom> weight increases significantly after quitting smoking , VAI levels , an indicator of cardiovascular risks , decrease significantly , especially in men or obese patients.
