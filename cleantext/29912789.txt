  Risk assessment of the use of quetiapine during breastfeeding is challenging owing to a paucity of data. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in lactating women who were taking quetiapine. The primary endpoint was to determine quetiapine concentration profiles in milk and estimated infant exposure levels. Multiple milk and a single blood quetiapine concentrations were determined using a highly sensitive liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy method. Nine subjects receiving fast-release quetiapine ( mean dose , 41 mg/d) were analyzed at steady state. The mean milk/plasma drug concentration ratio at 2-hour postdose was 0.47 ( SD , 0.50; range , 0.13-1.67). The mean milk concentration of each patient was 5.7 ng/mL ( SD , 4.5; range , 1.4-13.9 ng/mL). The mean infant quetiapine dose via milk per body<symptom> weight relative to weight-adjusted maternal dose was 0.16 % ( SD , 0.08; range , 0.04 % -0.35 %). Infant exposure levels to quetiapine via milk are predicted to be very small.
