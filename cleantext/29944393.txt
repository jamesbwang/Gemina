  RGS2 is a key modulator of stress in human airway epithelial cells , especially of hyperresponsiveness and mucin hypersecretion , both features of cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( CF). Because its expression can be modulated through the DNA methylation pathway , we hypothesize that RGS2 is downregulated by DNA hypermethylation in CF airway epithelial cells. This downregulation would then lead to an enhanced inflammatory response. We demonstrated RGS2 transcript and protein downregulation in cultured airway epithelial cells from CF patients and validated our findings in 2 CF epithelial cell lines. A methylated DNA immunoprecipitation array showed the presence of methylated cytosine on 13 gene promoters in CF. Among these genes , we confirmed that the RGS2 promoter was hypermethylated by using bisulfite conversion coupled with a methylation-specific PCR assay. Finally , we showed that downregulation of RGS2 in non-CF cells increases the expression of S100A12 , a proinflammatory marker. These results highlight the importance of epigenetic regulation in gene expression in CF and show that RGS2 might modulate the inflammatory response in CF through DNA methylation control.
