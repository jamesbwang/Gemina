  It is uncertain whether repeated measurements of a multi-target biomarker panel may help to personalize medical heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) therapy to improve outcome in chronic HF. This analysis included 499 patients from the Trial of Intensified versus standard Medical therapy in Elderly patients with Congestive Heart<symptom> Failure<symptom> ( TIME-CHF) , aged ≥ 60 years , LVEF ≤ 45 % , and NYHA ≥ II , who had repeated clinical visits within 19 months follow-up. The interaction between repeated measurements of biomarkers and treatment effects of loop diuretics , spironolactone , β-blockers , and renin-angiotensin system ( RAS) inhibitors on risk of HF hospitalization or death was investigated in a hypothesis-generating analysis. Generalized estimating equation ( GEE) models were used to account for the correlation between recurrences of events in a patient. One hundred patients ( 20 %) had just one event ( HF hospitalization or death) and 87 ( 17.4 %) had at least two events. Loop diuretic up-titration had a beneficial effect for patients with high interleukin-6 ( IL6) or high high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP) ( interaction , The data of this post hoc analysis suggest that decision-making using repeated biomarker measurements may be very promising in bringing treatment of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> to a new level in the context of predictive , preventive , and personalized medicine. Clearly , prospective testing is needed before this novel concept can be adopted. isrctn.org , identifier: ISRCTN43596477.
