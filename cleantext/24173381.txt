  Human health and safety depend on reliable measurements in medical diagnosis and on tests that support the selection and evaluation of therapeutic intervention and newly discovered molecular biomarkers must pass a rigorous evaluation process if they are to be of benefit to patients. Measurement standardization helps to maximize data quality and confidence and ultimately improves the reproducibility of published research. Failure to consider how a given experiment may be standardized can be costly , both financially as well as in time and failure to perform and report pre-clinical research in an appropriately rigorous manner will hinder the development of diagnostic methods. Hence standardization is a crucial step in maintaining the integrity of scientific studies and is a key feature of robust investigation.
