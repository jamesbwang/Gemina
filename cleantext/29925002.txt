  Exposure to cold temperature is well known to upregulate heat shock<symptom> protein ( Hsp) expression and recruit and/or activate brown adipose tissue and beige adipocytes in humans and animals. However , whether and how Hsps regulate adipocyte function for energy homeostatic responses is poorly understood. Here , we demonstrate a critical role of Hsp20 as a negative regulator of adipocyte function. Deletion of Hsp20 enhances non-shivering thermogenesis and suppresses inflammatory responses , leading to improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism under both chow diet and high-fat diet conditions. Mechanistically , Hsp20 controls adipocyte function by interacting with the subunit of the ubiquitin ligase complex , F-box only protein 4 ( FBXO4) , and regulating the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of peroxisome proliferation activated receptor gamma ( PPARγ). Indeed , Hsp20 deficiency mimics and enhances the pharmacological effects of the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone. Together , our findings suggest a role of Hsp20 in mediating adipocyte function by linking β-adrenergic signaling to PPARγ activity.
