  Educational programs are important tools for breast cancer prevention. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of health education in improving the knowledge and practices of female teachers regarding screening tools and the early detection of breast cancer. A two-group quasi-experimental design was conducted among 150 female teachers , who were selected from 75 schools of the Jazan General Administration of Education. Schools were chosen by a simple cluster randomization method and non-randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. Eligible participants were recruited by a simple randomization method , proportional to the total number of teachers at each school. Those in the intervention group ( n = 75) were compared to the control group ( n = 75) at baseline , as well as at 6 weeks and 3 months post-intervention. Knowledge of breast cancer screening tools was measured using a modified version of the Breast Cancer Knowledge test. Breast self-examination , clinical breast examination , and mammography practices were also measured. Compared to the control group , the intervention group showed a statistically significant increase in knowledge and practice levels at both 6 weeks and 3 months post-intervention. Thus , the results of this study provide evidence that group health education programs are effective in improving breast cancer knowledge and practices in female teachers. NCT03398057.
