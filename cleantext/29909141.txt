  Androgen-deprivation therapy ( ADT) is important in the treatment of prostate cancer. However , the relationship between ADT and the risk of diabetes remains unclear , and the association between duration and types of ADT has not been fully investigated. To examine the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) in men who underwent ADT for prostate cancer. Data were collected retrospectively from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database of Taiwan. In total , 4604 prostate cancer patients â‰¥ 40 years old who underwent ADT were included in the study cohort , and 4604 prostate cancer patients without ADT were included as controls , after adjusting for age and other comorbidities. During the four-year follow-up period , the incidence of new-onset T2DM was 27.49 and 11.13 per 1000 person-years in the ADT and ADT-never cohorts , respectively. The ADT cohort was 2.19 times more likely to develop T2DM than the control group ( 95 % CI 1.90-2.53 , P < 0.001). Furthermore , the association was particularly striking in the subgroup of patients receiving complete androgen blockade ( adjusted HR 2.33 , 95 % CI 1.96-2.78 , P < 0.001). Men with prostate cancer who received ADT are at risk for developing diabetes.
