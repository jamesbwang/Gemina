  A two-phase Hessian approach to DFT slab relaxation of slabs has been implemented and tested. It addresses weaknesses<symptom> in the modified Broyden and Pfrommer BFGS algorithms specific to relaxing slabs. Complete Hessian and then inverse Hessian matrices with no strain/stress components are first constructed at high force signal-to-noise ratios with no accompanying relaxation. In a second phase the static inverse Hessian is used to relax the slab down to a low force tolerance.
