  The kinesin heavy chain isoform 5A ( KIF5A) gene , which encodes a microtubule-based motor protein , plays an important role in the transport of organelles in the nerve cells. Mutations in the KIF5A showed a wide phenotypic spectrum from hereditary spastic paraplegia<symptom> ( HSP) to axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth peripheral neuropathy type 2 ( CMT2). This study identified three pathogenic KIF5A mutations in Korean CMT2 patients by whole exome sequencing. Two mutations ( p.Arg204Trp and p.Arg280His) were previously reported , but p.Leu558Pro was determined to be a novel de novo mutation. All the mutations were not observed in the healthy controls and were located in highly conserved domains among vertebrate species. The p.Arg204Trp mutation was identified from a CMT2 patient with additional complex phenotypes of HSP , ataxia<symptom> , fatigability and pyramidal sign , but the p.Arg280His and p.Leu588Pro mutations were identified in each axonal CMT2 patient. The p.Arg204Trp mutation was previously reported in a HSP patient with no CMT symptom. The p.Arg280His mutation was reported in a CMT2 patient , which was similarly with our case. However , it was also once reported in a HSP patient with pes cavus. As the first report in Korea , this study identified three KIF5A mutations as the underlying cause of axonal peripheral neuropathy with or without the HSP phenotype. We confirmed a wide inter- and intra-allelic phenotypic spectrum by the mutations in the KIF5A.
