  Programmed death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1) immunohistochemistry ( IHC) is essential in patients of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer to determine eligibility for immunotherapy. PD-L1 IHC assays have been clinically validated only on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue; however , lung cancer is frequently diagnosed on cytology. PD-L1 immunocytochemistry ( ICC) has shown high concordance of immunoexpression between cytology samples and paired small biopsies. Feasibility of liquid-based cytology ( LBC) smears for PD-L1 ICC has not been analysed previously. PD-L1 ICC and IHC ( clone SP263) were performed on paired LBC smears and small biopsies , respectively , in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Cases with fewer than 100 viable tumour cells on LBC smear/biopsy were excluded from analysis. PD-L1 was interpreted positive when 25 % or more tumour cells showed membranous and/or cytoplasmic protein expression of any intensity greater than background staining. A total of 26 patients , harbouring adenocarcinomas ( 50 %) and squamous cell carcinomas ( 50 %) , had available bronchial brushings/washings processed as LBC smears and concurrently obtained endobronchial biopsies. PD-L1 IHC was interpreted positive in 46 % ( 12/26) biopsies. PD-L1 ICC was interpreted positive in 35 % ( 9/26) LBC smears , all of which were IHC-positive. No IHC-negative case was positive on cytology. The overall concordance between LBC smears and small biopsies was 88.4 %. PD-L1 ICC can be performed on LBC processed smears , with certain challenges in interpretation inherent to LBC smears and their processing methods. Nevertheless , they represent a potential resource for ICC , especially when alternate histology material is not available. Future studies are required to validate the predictive value of PD-L1 ICC on LBC smears.
