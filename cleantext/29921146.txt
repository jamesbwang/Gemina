  A role for aberrant reward processing in the pathogenesis of depression<symptom> has long been proposed. However , no review has yet examined its role in depression<symptom> by integrating conceptual and quantitative findings across functional MRI ( fMRI) and EEG methodologies. The authors quantified these effects , with an emphasis on development. A total of 38 fMRI and 12 EEG studies were entered into fMRI and EEG meta-analyses. fMRI studies primarily examined reward anticipation and reward feedback. These were analyzed using the activation likelihood estimation method. EEG studies involved mainly the feedback-related negativity ( FRN) event-related potential , and these studies were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis of the association between FRN and depression<symptom> Analysis of fMRI studies revealed significantly reduced striatal activation in depressed compared with healthy individuals during reward feedback. When region-of-interest analyses were included , reduced activation was also observed in reward anticipation , an effect that was stronger in individuals under age 18. FRN was also significantly reduced in depression<symptom> , with pronounced effects in individuals under age 18. In longitudinal studies , reduced striatal activation in fMRI and blunted FRN in EEG were found to precede the onset of depression<symptom> in adolescents. Taken together , the findings show consistent neural aberrations during reward processing in depression<symptom> , namely , reduced striatal signal during feedback and blunted FRN. These aberrations may underlie the pathogenesis of depression<symptom> and have important implications for development of new treatments.
