  The discovery of molecular toxicity in a clinical drug candidate can have a significant impact on both the cost and timeline of the drug discovery process. Early identification of potentially toxic compounds during screening library preparation or , alternatively , during the hit validation process , is critical to ensure that valuable time and resources are not spent pursuing compounds that may possess a high propensity for human toxicity. This chapter focuses on the application of computational molecular filters , applied either prescreening or postscreening , to identify and remove known reactive and/or potentially toxic compounds from consideration in drug discovery campaigns.
