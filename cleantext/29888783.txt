  Beta cell apoptosis is a major feature of type 1 diabetes , and pro-inflammatory cytokines are key drivers of the deterioration of beta cell mass through induction of apoptosis. Mitochondrial stress plays a critical role in mediating apoptosis by releasing cytochrome C into the cytoplasm , directly activating caspase-9 and its downstream signalling cascade. We aimed to identify new compounds that protect beta cells from cytokine-induced activation of the intrinsic ( mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis. Diabetogenic media , composed of IL-1β , IFN-γ and high glucose , were used to induce mitochondrial stress in rat insulin-producing INS1E cells , and a high-content image-based screen of small molecule modulators of Casp9 pathway was performed. A novel small molecule , ATV399 , was identified from a high-content image-based screen for compounds that inhibit cleaved caspase-9 activation and subsequent beta cell apoptosis induced by a combination of IL-1β , IFN-γ and high glucose , which together mimic the pathogenic diabetic milieu. Through medicinal chemistry optimization , potency was markedly improved ( 6-30 fold) , with reduced inhibitory effects on CYP3A4. Improved analogues , such as CAT639 , improved beta cell viability and insulin secretion in cytokine-treated rat insulin-producing INS1E cells and primary dispersed islet cells. Mechanistically , CAT639 reduced the production of NO by allosterically inhibiting dimerization of inducible NOS ( iNOS) without affecting its mRNA levels. Taken together , these studies demonstrate a successful phenotypic screening campaign resulting in identification of an inhibitor of iNOS dimerization that protects beta cell viability and function through modulation of mitochondrial stress induced by cytokines.
