  A number of bacteria provoking zoonotic diseases present intracellular survival and a host cell tropism limited to the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Thus , infection is rendered difficult to eradicate , causing chronic inflammatory reactions to the host and widespread prevalence. Although self-inactivating lentiviral vectors have been successfully tested in the clinic against virally-induced human<disease> infectious<disease> diseases<disease> , little is known about the transduction susceptibility of ruminant animal phagocytes that play a critical role in the outbreak of zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis<disease> In view of the development of a lentiviral vector-based platform targeting and inactivating specific genetic features of intracellular bacteria , we have tested the transducibility of ovine macrophages in terms of transgene expression and vector copy number ( VCN). We show that ovine macrophages are relatively resistant to transduction even at a high multiplicity of infection with a conventional lentiviral vector expressing the green fluorescence protein and that addition of transduction enhancers , such as polybrene , increases transgene expression even after a one-week culture of the transduced cells in vitro. Overall , we demonstrate that ovine macrophages may be efficiently expanded and transduced in culture , thus providing the benchmark for gene therapy applications for zoonotic diseases.
