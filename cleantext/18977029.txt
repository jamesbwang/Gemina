  A non-fouling electrochemical immunosensor is described for determination of the tumor biomarker carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA). It is based on the use of composite wires made by chemical grafting of hyaluronic acid onto polyaniline nanowires. The modified nanowires possess excellent antifouling property both in single protein solutions and in dilute serum samples. The current of immunoelectrode exhibits a linear response in the 0.01 pg mL
