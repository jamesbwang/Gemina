  Each cell is a phenotypically unique individual that is influenced by internal and external processes , operating in parallel. To characterize the dynamics of cellular processes one needs to observe many individual cells from multiple points of view and over time , so as to identify commonalities and variability. With this aim , we engineered a software , `` SCIP '' , to analyse multi-modal , multi-process , time-lapse microscopy morphological and functional images. SCIP is capable of automatic and/or manually corrected segmentation of cells and lineages , automatic alignment of different microscopy channels , as well as detect , count and characterize fluorescent spots ( such as RNA tagged by MS2-GFP) , nucleoids , Z rings , Min system , inclusion bodies , undefined structures , etc.. The results can be exported into * mat files and all results can be jointly analysed , to allow studying not only each feature and process individually , but also find potential relationships. While we exemplify its use on Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , many of its functionalities are expected to be of use in analysing other prokaryotes and eukaryotic cells as well. We expect SCIP to facilitate the finding of relationships between cellular processes , from small-scale ( e.g. gene expression) to large-scale ( e.g. cell division) , in single cells and cell lineages. http://www.ca3-uninova.org/project_scip.
