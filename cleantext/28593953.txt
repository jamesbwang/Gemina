  In the originally published version of this Letter , the x axis in Fig. 3a should have been: ` PC1: 26 % ' rather than ` PC1: 46 % ' , and the y axis should have been: ` PC2: 16 % ' rather than ` PC2: 29 % '. We also noticed an error in the numbering of the fossils from Qafzeh: Qafzeh 27 should be removed , and Qafzeh 26 is actually Qafzeh 25 , following Tillier ( 2014) 1 and Schuh et al. ( 2017) 2 and personal communication with B. Vandermeersch and M. D. Garralda. The correct enumeration of Qafzeh samples in the ` Mandibular metric data ' section of the Methods is therefore: ` Qafzeh ( 9 , 25) ' rather than ` Qafzeh ( 9 , 26 , 27) '. Owing to the removal of Qafzeh 27 , the convex hull of early modern humans changes slightly in Extended Data Fig. 1c. The sample sizes in Extended Data Fig. 1c should have read: Middle Pleistocene archaic Homo n = 19 ( instead of 11) , Neanderthals n = 40 ( instead of 41) , early modern humans n = 12 ( instead of 7) , and recent modern humans n = 46 ( instead of 48). In Extended Data Table 2 , the mean and standard deviation of corpus height and breadth at mental foramen for early modern humans should have been: x̅ = 33.15 , σ = 3.26 for height ( rather than x̅ = 34.23 , σ = 4.57); and x̅ = 16.25 , σ = 1.28 for breadth ( rather than x̅ = 16.04 , σ = 1.75). Accordingly , n = 12 ( rather than n = 13) for both breadth and height. These errors have been corrected in the Letter online ( the original Extended Data Fig. 1 is shown in Supplementary Information to this Amendment). These changes do not alter any inferences drawn from the data.
