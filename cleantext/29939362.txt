  The generation of scientists and physicians that took part in starting the whole era of modern-assisted reproduction is currently close to retirement or has already left research. A new generation is about to take over and the profession is facing a massive transgenerational transition. Since current treatments have reached a plateau in success rates and costs , new research and development is required to further advance the field. Today , multi-disciplinary platforms including numerous research areas , not previously integrated in our field , are fundamental to achieve new clinical approaches. Structured , broader and purposeful education of young researchers should be intensified and prioritized , and innovative educational initiatives are needed to facilitate ` thinkers ' and advance developments in the field of assisted reproduction.
