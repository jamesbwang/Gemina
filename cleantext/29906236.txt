  To evaluate the correlation between preparative solid food status and the incidence of nausea<symptom> , vomiting and aspiration symptoms in contrast-enhanced CT examination , and to provide direction for standardizing the preparative dietary policies. Patients who underwent routine enhanced CT examination at our hospital between June 2015 and June 2017 ( 110,836 cases) were enrolled and allocated into solid food fasting group ( 51,807 cases) and solid food non-fasting group ( 59,029 cases). Fluids ingestion was not restricted for any case. The differences in the incidence of nausea<symptom> , vomiting and aspiration symptoms between the two groups of patients with various basic data were compared. The risk factors for the occurrence of nausea<symptom> , vomiting and aspiration symptoms were analyzed. The total incidence of nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> was extremely low ( 0.071 %) , and no aspiration developed. There was no significant difference in the incidence of nausea<symptom> and vomiting between the two groups in all respects ( p > 0.05). The incidence of nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> in patients with an iodine adverse drug reaction ( ADR) history was higher than those with other ADR history ( p = 0.008) and those without ADR history ( p = 0.001). The occurrence of nausea<symptom> and vomiting<symptom> has no correlation with the preparative solid food status. Unless compulsory in clinical needs and constraints and gastrointestinal examination , solid food fasting is not a must in other examinations. Particular attention should be paid to the patients with an iodine ADR history in an effort to prevent possible ADRs. Advances in knowledge: The correlation between preparative solid food status and the incidence of nausea<symptom> , vomiting and aspiration symptoms in contrast-enhanced CT examination were comprehensively analyzed in a large-scale population.
