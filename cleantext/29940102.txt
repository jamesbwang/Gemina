  The need for new pharmacological lead structures , especially against drug resistances , has led to a surge in natural product research and discovery. New biosynthetic gene cluster capturing methods to efficiently clone and heterologously express natural product pathways have thus been developed. Direct pathway cloning ( DiPaC) is an emerging synthetic biology strategy that utilizes long-amplification PCR and HiFi DNA assembly for the capture and expression of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters. Here , we have further streamlined DiPaC by reducing cloning time and reagent costs by utilizing T4 DNA polymerase ( sequence- and ligation-independent cloning , SLIC) for gene cluster capture. As a proof of principle , the majority of the cyanobacterial hapalosin gene cluster was cloned as a single piece ( 23 kb PCR product) using this approach , and predicted transcriptional terminators were removed by simultaneous pathway refactoring , leading to successful heterologous expression. The complementation of DiPaC with SLIC depicts a time and cost-efficient method for simple capture and expression of new natural product pathways.
