  Variation in the gut microbiome has been linked to colorectal cancer ( CRC) , as well as to host genetic variation. However , we do not know whether , in addition to baseline host genetics , somatic mutational profiles in CRC tumors interact with the surrounding tumor microbiome , and if so , whether these changes can be used to understand microbe-host interactions with potential functional biological relevance. Here , we characterized the association between CRC microbial communities and tumor mutations using microbiome profiling and whole-exome sequencing in 44 pairs of tumors and matched normal tissues. We found statistically significant associations between loss-of-function mutations in tumor genes and shifts in the abundances of specific sets of bacterial taxa , suggestive of potential functional interaction. This correlation allows us to statistically predict interactions between loss-of-function tumor mutations in cancer-related genes and pathways , including MAPK and Wnt signaling , solely based on the composition of the microbiome. In conclusion , our study shows that CRC microbiomes are correlated with tumor mutational profiles , pointing towards possible mechanisms of molecular interaction.
