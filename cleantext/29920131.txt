  Genetics of host plays a significant role in susceptibility and pathogenesis of disease. During hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>) infection , HCV<pathogen> proteins interfere with interferon ( IFN) signaling pathways and upregulate transcription of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 and 3 genes ( SOCS1 and SOCS3) , which results in impaired immune response. In this study , we evaluated relative expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in untreated HCV<pathogen> patients and patients treated with 2 different treatment strategies that are , ( IFN therapy and direct-acting antiviral ( DAA) drug regimen. To study gene expression , peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) were isolated by using Histopaque. Total RNA was extracted from PBMCs by using BIOzol. Nine microgram of total RNA from each sample was used and reverse transcribed into single-stranded complementary DNA ( cDNA) by using M-MLV reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen). The synthesized cDNA was diluted to a final concentration of 500 ng/Î¼L. This diluted cDNA was further used for expression analysis of SOCS1and SOCS3 genes using Rotor Gene Q Real-Time PCR Detection System ( QIAGEN). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH) was amplified as a housekeeping gene. We found that the SOCS1 expression in IFN and DAA-treated patient groups was 5.4 fold and 1.2 fold , respectively , high compared with the healthy controls ( IFN versus healthy , P = 0.019 and DAA versus healthy , P = 0.91) , whereas the SOCS3 expression in IFN and DAA-treated patient groups was 3.7 fold and 2 fold , respectively , high in comparison with the expression in healthy controls ( IFN versus healthy , P = 0.025 and DAA versus healthy , P = 0.03). We also found a significant difference in the relative expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in DAAs-treated and IFN/ribavirin ( RBV)- treated and untreated individual. We concluded that by targeting HCV<pathogen> proteins with DAAs , SOCS1 , and SOCS3 transcription can be more effectively normalized compared to the treatment with IFN/RBV therapy.
