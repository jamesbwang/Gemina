  We report a case of a woman who presented with worsening shortness of breath due to a migrated ventriculoatrial shunt catheter into the pulmonary artery causing severe pulmonary insufficiency. She underwent surgical catheter removal. The majority of the catheter was easily retrieved; however , there were areas where the catheter was embedded into the myocardium , which would have posed a challenge with an endovascular approach.
