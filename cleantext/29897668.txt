  Lignosulfonate is a byproduct of the sulfite pulping process and has limited use in industry. The main objective of this study was to investigate the carboxyethylation of lignosulfonate to increase its charge density to broaden its applications. The carboxyethylation of lignosulfonate was optimized under the conditions of 30 wt % NaOH , 2.0 mol mol
