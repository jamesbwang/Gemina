  To compare standard emergency department ( ED) workflow to a protocolized pathway using upfront point-of-care ( POC) tests performed prior to doctor evaluation to determine if this could produce a significant reduction in treatment time. We performed a prospective , randomized , controlled trial. Patients were randomized to receive the standard of care or one of the enhanced workflow pathways with POC tests. There were 1,044 patients enrolled. All workflows , except electrocardiogram and low-dose x-ray ( LODOX) , exceeded the outcome measure ( 20 % reduction in treatment time). It was significantly shorter compared with the control workflow if the patient received any ( i-STAT + CBC)- containing workflows ( P = .0001 , P = .020 , P = .0009 , P = .011) , as well as the i-STAT + LODOX workflows ( P = .0001 , P = .034). The full benefit of POC testing can be realized if it is implemented prior to doctor evaluation , as part of a standardized procedure in the ED. This allows for a more rapid availability of investigation results subsequently leading to decreased treatment times.
