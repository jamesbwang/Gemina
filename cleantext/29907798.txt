  Describe the clinical and molecular findings of patients with Kabuki syndrome<disease> ( KS) who present with hypoglycemia due to congenital hyperinsulinism ( HI) , and assess the incidence of KS in patients with HI. We documented the clinical features and molecular diagnoses of 10 infants with persistent HI and KS via a combination of sequencing and copy-number profiling methodologies. Subsequently , we retrospectively evaluated 100 infants with HI lacking a genetic diagnosis , for causative variants in KS genes. Molecular diagnoses of KS were established by identification of pathogenic variants in KMT2D ( n = 5) and KDM6A ( n = 5). Among the 100 infants with HI of unknown genetic etiology , a KS diagnosis was uncovered in one patient. The incidence of HI among patients with KS may be higher than previously reported , and KS may account for as much as 1 % of patients diagnosed with HI. As the recognition of dysmorphic features associated with KS is challenging in the neonatal period , we propose KS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of HI. Since HI in patients with KS is well managed medically , a timely recognition of hyperinsulinemic episodes will improve outcomes , and prevent aggravation of the preexisting mild to moderate intellectual disability in KS.
