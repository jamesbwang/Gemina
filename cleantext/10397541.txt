  HIV<pathogen> treatment guidelines now recommend antiretroviral therapy ( ART) initiation regardless of CD4 count to maximize benefit both for the individual and society. It is unknown whether the initiation of ART at higher CD4 counts would affect adherence levels. We investigated whether initiating ART at higher CD4 counts was associated with sub-optimal adherence ( < 95 %) during the first 12 months of ART. A prospective cohort study nested within a two-arm cluster-randomized trial of universal test and treat was implemented from March 2012 to June 2016 to measure the impact of ART on HIV<pathogen> incidence in rural KwaZulu-Natal. ART was initiated regardless of CD4 count in the intervention arm and according to national guidelines in the control arm. ART adherence was measured monthly using a visual analogue scale ( VAS) and pill counts ( PC). HIV<pathogen> viral load was measured at ART initiation , three and six months , and six-monthly thereafter. We pooled data from participants in both arms and used random-effects logistic regression models to examine the association between CD4 count at ART initiation and sub-optimal adherence , and assessed if adherence levels were associated with virological suppression. Among 900 individuals who initiated ART â‰¥ 12 months before study end , median ( IQR) CD4 at ART initiation was 350 cells/mm We found no evidence that higher CD4 counts at ART initiation were associated with sub-optimal ART adherence in the first 12 months. Our findings should alleviate concerns about adherence in individuals initiating ART at higher CD4 counts , however long-term outcomes are needed. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01509508.
