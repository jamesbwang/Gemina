  Extended periods of skeletal muscle disuse result in muscle atrophy. Following limb immobilization , increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production may contribute to atrophy through increases in skeletal muscle protein degradation. However , the effect of skeletal muscle disuse on mitochondrial ROS production remains unclear. This study investigated the effect of immobilization , followed by two subsequent periods of restored physical activity , on mitochondrial H
