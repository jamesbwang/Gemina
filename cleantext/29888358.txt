  A simple protocol to directly access Î³-amino acid derivatives by intermolecular regioselective hydroamination of trichloroethyl alkenyldiazoacetates with carbamate using a silver tetrafluoroborate catalyst is described. Density functional theory ( DFT) calculations to analyze the reaction mechanism revealed that multiple attractive interactions occur in a transition state to promote the vinylogous addition of nitrogen nucleophiles.
