  Adolescents and young adults ( AYAs) comprise the largest age group affected by Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL). Despite excellent overall survival of AYA patients with HL due to advances in treatment regimens , therapy-associated late effects continue to be a concern in HL survivors , especially for younger patients who have decades of life remaining. Since the first clinical trial for HL with chemotherapy in 1964 , subsequent protocols have attempted to reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicities and yet maintain high overall survival rates. Today , new analytic methods applied to data from survivorship cohorts , such as the recently described cumulative burden of disease metric , can be used to inform changes for future protocols. Although pediatric and adult trial consortia have followed this process , the AYA population , an age cohort split between pediatric and adult health care services , faces many barriers to care and is the least likely to be enrolled in clinical trials. AYA patients with HL theoretically have a choice to be treated in pediatric or adult protocols when presented with these options. Recent efforts by the National Clinical Trials Network , the Children 's Oncology Group , and others have been made to ensure that the burden of choice for the AYA population is not greater than the burden of disease.
