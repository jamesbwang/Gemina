  Traditionally , the manner of death in most hospital autopsy cases is natural , in which death is due to the natural course of disease or reasonably anticipated outcomes of medical interventions. Some cases fall into a potential gray zone between natural and accident , including rare or unanticipated outcomes of medical interventions. We present a case of a patient postcoronary artery bypass graft. Autopsy revealed the proximal anastomosis of the aorta-to-first-diagonal-coronary-artery-to-second-obtuse-marginal-artery graft was detached from the aorta. A broken suture was present at the disconnected anastomosis , with intact knots but was broken along its length. In-hospital mortality rates of CABG range from 1 % to 3 % , with several autopsy studies identifying surgical complications as the cause of death in one-third of perioperative deaths. No publications were found that described suture rupture as directly relating to the cause of death. This case report describes a previously unreported complication of coronary artery bypass grafting.
