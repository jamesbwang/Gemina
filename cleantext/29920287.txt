  The combination of carotenoids and doxorubicin ( DOX) selectively alters oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Primarily , cytotoxic efficiency of carotenoids ( β-carotene , BC; lutein , LUT; astaxanthin , AST; or fucoxanthin , FUCO) either with or without a minimal cytotoxic dose of DOX was evaluated in MCF-7 ( 0.12 μM) and MDA-MB-231 cells ( 0.28 μM). The higher cell growth inhibition of BC and/or LUT with DOX was selected for testing in further cell-based assays. Low-dose DOX significantly enhanced cytotoxicity in carotenoid ( < 5 μM)- treated cells compared to high-dose DOX ( > 1 μM) or carotenoid ( 20 μM) treatment alone. Depleted glutathione , increased lipid peroxides and increased ROS levels in cells confirmed the cytotoxic effect. Furthermore , mitochondrial dysfunction , cell growth arrest at G0/G1 phase and caspase cascades as well as up- and down-regulated expression levels of related proteins ( p21 , p27 , Bax , p53 , Bcl-2 , and cyclin D1) revealed the synergistic effect of carotenoid and DOX treatment on ROS-mediated apoptosis. These observations demonstrated increased apoptosis in BC + DOX/LUT + DOX-treated cells due to the pronounced pro-oxidant action. Interestingly , normal breast epithelial cells ( MCF 10A) exposed to similar treatments resulted in non-significant cytotoxicity. These newly observed mechanistic differences of anticancer drugs on the mitigation of toxicity with carotenoids may provide insight into the targeting of cancer therapy.
