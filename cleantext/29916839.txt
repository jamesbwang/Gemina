  PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration is a major subtype of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. Patients with PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration usually present degenerative motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom> with neuropsychiatric disturbance. This report presents a patient with PLA2G6-related dystonia-parkinsonism , who had neuropsychiatric symptoms preceding movement symptoms<symptom>. Antipsychotic drug was prescribed , and he developed parkinsonism years later. Differential diagnosis between drug-induced parkinsonism and PLA2G6-related dystonia-parkinsonism could be challenging. PLA2G6 sequencing has to be considered facing a patient with adulthood parkinsonism , especially when it is associated with initial psychiatric symptoms. Our case highlights a common problem treating psychiatric symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases that lead to parkinsonism. The use of antipsychotics requires a special caution in these patients because it may cause extrapyramidal symptoms. Aripiprazole had therapeutic effect on both mood and psychotic symptoms and less impact on motor features , which may be considered an ideal pharmacological approach in treating these patients.
