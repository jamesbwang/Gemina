  In this study , we aimed to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of crude leaf extracts from Piper gaudichaudianum Kunth , P. arboreum Aub. , P. umbellata L. , P. fuligineum Kunth , and Peperomia obtusifolia A. Dietr. on an in vitro model of inflammatory response. The crude extracts were previously obtained by maceration of the leaves. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration was determined by the MTT assay using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Human monocytes were simultaneously challenged with each crude extract and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) , the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria , to induce a strong inflammatory response. After 24 h of incubation , cell-free supernatants were used for evaluating the mediators involved in inflammation<symptom>: H2O2 , TNF-α , IL-8 , IL-6 , IL-1β , IL-10 , IL-12 , FGF-b , and TGF-β1. We also compared the results with the effects of ketoprofen , a well-known anti-inflammatory drug. The P. gaudichaudianum crude extract downmodulated the production of H2O2 , IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TGF-β1 by LPS-stimulated monocytes; P. arboreum , IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-8 , and TNF-α; P. umbellata and P. fuligineum , H2O2 , IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , and TNF-α; and P. obtusifolia , H2O2 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , and TNF-α. In general , the crude leaf extracts amplified the anti-inflammatory response when compared with ketoprofen , particularly reducing the production of IL-8 , a mediator involved in neutrophil recruitment during tissue damage. Thus , the crude leaf extracts of P. gaudichaudianum , P. arboreum , P. umbellata , P. fuligineum , and Peperomia obtusifolia elicited an anti-inflammatory response against LPS-challenged monocytes. These findings show the anti-inflammatory properties of these crude leaf extracts and offer new perspectives for their use in the treatment of
