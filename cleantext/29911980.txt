  Recent studies suggest that vibration of piano keys affect the perceived quality of the instrument , as well as the dynamic control and timing in piano playing. However , the time signals of piano key vibrations and its physical properties have not been analyzed and compared to the threshold of vibration sensation in a real-life playing situation yet. This study investigates piano key vibrations and explores the diversity of vibrations among different pianos with a laser Doppler vibrometer. A pianist was performing single keystrokes , note sequences , and a music piece excerpt on four concert grand pianos , five grand pianos , and two upright pianos. The measurements showed peak displacement levels up to 80 m and the frequency spectrum of the vibrations is dominated by frequencies lower than 500 Hz. Finally , a frequency weighting filter is introduced to show that vibration displacement time signals exceed the threshold of human vibration sensation for all evaluated instruments , when a note sequence is played in the bass to mid range with a single hand at forte level. The conducted experiments demonstrate that the vibration characteristics vary distinctively among the investigated pianos.
