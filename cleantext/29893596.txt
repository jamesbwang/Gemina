  A number of studies have noted low levels of Vitamin D in dancers and this has been associated with increased risk of injuries and decreased muscular strength indices. The aim of the present study was to examine whether vitamin D supplementation over a 4-month period can improve muscle function and injury incidence. Eighty-four participants volunteered , exclusion criteria and drop out ( 19 %) reduced cohort to 67 ( f = 29 , m = 38; 17-19yrs). Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention or placebo group ( 2:1 ratio). All provided a venous blood sample pre and post the 4-month study period. The intervention group received 120,000 IU vitamin D to be taken over a 1-week period and the placebo group received the same number of inert pills. Participants completed a series of muscle function tests pre and post the monitoring period. Injury incidence was recorded by the independent health team at the school. Pre-intervention 6 % of the cohort were vitamin D deficient , 81 % were insufficient and 13 % had sufficient levels; post-intervention 53 % were insufficient and 47 % were sufficient. The intervention group reported a significant increase in serum 25 ( OH) D3 ( 57 %; p < 0.00) and isometric strength ( 7.8 %; p = 0.022) but not muscular power. There was a significant association between traumatic injury occurrence for the intervention and control groups ( 10.9 % vs. 31.8 %; p < .02). Vitamin D supplementation decreased the numbers of deficient and insufficient participants within this cohort. The intervention group reported a small significant increase in muscle strength that was negatively associated with traumatic injury occurrence.
