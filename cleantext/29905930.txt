  There is a significant unmet need to develop antimicrobial solutions to reduce the risk of contamination in fresh produce. Bacteriophages have been proposed as a potential approach for controlling foodborne pathogens. This study evaluated the combination of edible dip coatings with T7 bacteriophages on whole and cut produce. The evaluation includes an assessment of phage loading , phage storage stability , antimicrobial activity , and phage stability during simulated gastric digestion on sliced cucumbers , sliced apples , and whole cherry tomatoes. In this evaluation , phages coated on fresh produce using edible whey protein isolate ( WPI) were compared with phages coated from an aqueous suspension ( control coating). The results demonstrated that WPI coatings load more phages than the control and enhanced phage stability during cold storage ( 4 Â°C) for cut apples and whole cherry tomatoes. Phage stability decreased by 1 to 3 log ( PFU) in a simulated gastric environment. Phage antimicrobial activity against Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> BL21 decreased 2 to 4 log ( CFU) of bacteria on cut apples and whole cherry tomatoes , while no significant bacterial reduction was observed for sliced cucumbers. Overall , the results show that WPI dip coating provides phage loading , stability , and antimicrobial activity to produce surfaces compared to the control coating , and thus may be considered an effective approach for extending phage therapy on fresh produce. The practical application is to prevent bacterial cross contamination of fresh produce by using a combination of edible coating with bacteriophages. The results demonstrate enhanced loading and stability of phages on fresh produce when used in combination with an edible coating.
