  Transcription factors are proteins that modulate the transcriptional rate of target genes in the nucleus in response to extracellular or cytoplasmic signals. Activating transcription factors 2 ( ATF2) and 3 ( ATF3) respond to environmental signals and maintain cellular homeostasis. There is evidence that inflammation<symptom> and nerve injury modulate ATF2 and ATF3 expression. However , the function of these transcription factors in pain is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution of ATF2 and ATF3 to nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. L5/6 spinal nerve ligation induced tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Moreover , nerve damage enhanced ATF2 and ATF3 protein expression in injured L5/6 dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord but not in uninjured L4 dorsal root ganglia. Nerve damage also enhanced ATF2 immunoreactivity in dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord 7 to 21 days post-injury. Repeated intrathecal post-treatment with a small-interfering RNA targeted against ATF2 ( ATF2 siRNA) or anti-ATF2 antibody partially reversed tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. In contrast , ATF3 siRNA or anti-ATF3 antibody did not modify nociceptive behaviors. ATF2 immunoreactivity was found in dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord co-labeling with NeuN mainly in non-peptidergic ( IB4
