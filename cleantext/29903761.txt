  Acute myeloid leukemia<disease> is a disease of the elderly ( median age at diagnosis , 65-70 years). The prognosis of older acute myeloid leukemia<disease> patients is generally poor. While genetic markers have become important tools for risk stratification and treatment selection in young and middle-aged acute myeloid leukemia<disease> patients , their applicability in very old patients is less clear. We sought to validate existing genetic risk classifications systems and identify additional factors associated with outcomes in intensively treated acute myeloid leukemia<disease> patients aged â‰¥ 75 years. In 151 acute myeloid leukemia<disease> patients who received induction chemotherapy in the AMLCG-1999 trial , we investigated recurrently mutated genes using a targeted sequencing assay covering 64 genes. The median number of mutated genes per patient was four. The most commonly mutated genes were TET2 ( 42 %) , DNMT3A ( 35 %) , NPM1 ( 32 %) , SRSF2 ( 25 %) and ASXL1 ( 21 %). The complete remission rate was 44 % and the 3-year survival was 21 % for the entire cohort. While adverse-risk cytogenetics ( MRC classification) associated with shorter OS ( p = 0.001) , NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations ( present in 18 %) had no significant impact on OS. Notably , none of the 13 IDH1 mutated patients ( 9 %) reached CR. Consequently , the OS of this subgroup was significantly shorter than for IDH1 wildtype patients ( p < 0.001). In summary , even among very old intensively treated acute myeloid leukemia<disease> patients , adverse-risk cytogenetics predict inferior survival. The spectrum and relevance of driver gene mutations in elderly patients differs from that in younger patients. Our data imply IDH1 mutations as a novel marker for chemorefractory disease and inferior prognosis. ( AMLCG-1999 trial: clinicaltrials.gov identifier , NCT00266136).
