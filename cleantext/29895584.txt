  This study sought to explore the prognostic factors in a large retrospective cohort of patients with B-cell primary ocular lymphoma ( POL) from the Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results database. There were 2778 patients with B-cell POL whose complete clinical information was listed in the Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results database between 1997 and 2014. The epidemiology , therapeutic measures , and clinical characteristics were listed as descriptive statistics. Survival analysis was conducted by univariate and multivariable Cox regression models. Multivariate analysis identified age , lymphoma subtype , primary lesion<symptom> , and radiation status as independent prognostic factors. For indolent lymphoma , radical treatment , especially intravenous chemotherapy , should be avoided. For invasive lymphoma , chemotherapy combined with full orbital irradiation is recommended. Radiotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone. These differences were statistically significant ( p < 0.05). Radiation brings benefits , with tolerable neurotoxicity , to patients with invasive B-cell POL. Radical tumor treatment may not be needed for patients with indolent B-cell POL.
