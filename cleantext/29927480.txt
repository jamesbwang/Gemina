  Despite the high and rising incidence rate of keratinocyte cancer ( KC) and the importance of incorporating patient values in evidence-based care , few studies have focused on the perspectives of KC patients. To identify the needs and preferences of basal cell carcinoma ( BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC) patients regarding care. A qualitative study consisting of three focus groups with BCC patients and three focus groups with SCC patients was conducted. A total of 42 patients participated. In each focus group , patients ' needs and preferences regarding treatment and follow-up were discussed , using a predefined topic list. All sessions were transcribed verbatim and analysed by two researchers. The following needs and preferences were identified: the need to ( 1) receive all relevant , tailored information ( 2) a physician that takes you seriously and communicates well ( 3) a short waiting period and the best treatment with direct results ( 4) to be seen by the same physician ( 5) a preference for dermatologist during treatment and ( 6) follow-up and ( 7) a general need for structured follow-up care ( 8) including a full body<symptom> skin examination. BCC patients additionally expressed the need for openness and transparency and to participate in shared decision making. To organise skin cancer care that is better tailored to the needs of KC patients , providing patient-centred care , e.g. investing in the patient-physician relationship , personalising the type and form of information , and the follow-up schedules , is advocated. Adding the patient 's perspective to current guidelines could facilitate this process. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
