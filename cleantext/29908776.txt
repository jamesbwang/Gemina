  To evaluate the impact of antibiotic therapy for chronic endometritis<disease> ( CE) on IVF outcome. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Not applicable. Infertile women with history of recurrent implantation failure , defined as two or more failed ETs , undergoing one or more IVF cycle ( s). The review was registered in PROSPERO ( CRD42017062494) before the start of the literature search. Observational studies were identified by searching electronic databases. The following comparators were included: women with CE receiving antibiotics vs. untreated controls; women with cured CE vs. women with persistent CE; and women with cured CE vs. women with normal endometrial histology ( negative for CE). The summary measures were reported as odds ratio ( OR) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI). Clinical pregnancy rate ( CPR) , ongoing pregnancy rate/live birth rate ( OPR/LBR) , implantation rate ( IR) , miscarriage rate. A total of 796 patients ( from five studies) were included. Women receiving antibiotic therapy ( without the histologic confirmation of CE cure) did not show any advantage in comparison with untreated controls ( OPR/LBR , CPR , and IR). Patients with cured CE showed higher OPR/LBR ( OR 6.81) , CPR ( OR 4.02) , and IR ( OR 3.24) in comparison with patients with persistent CE. In vitro fertilization outcome was comparable between women with cured CE and those without CE ( OPR/LBR , CPR , and IR). Miscarriage rate was not significantly different between groups. Chronic endometritis<disease> therapy may improve IVF outcome in patients suffering from recurrent implantation failure. A control biopsy should always confirm CE resolution before proceeding with IVF.
