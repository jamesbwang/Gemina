  Attempts at eradicating metastatic cancers with targeted therapies are limited by the emergence of resistant subclones bearing heterogeneous ( epi) genetic changes. We used colorectal cancer ( CRC) to test the hypothesis that interfering with an ancestral oncogenic event shared by all the malignant cells ( such as WNT pathway alterations) could override heterogeneous mechanisms of acquired drug resistance. Here , we report that in CRC-resistant cell populations , phylogenetic analysis uncovers a complex subclonal architecture , indicating parallel evolution of multiple independent cellular lineages. Functional and pharmacological modulation of WNT signalling induces cell death in CRC preclinical models from patients that relapsed during the treatment , regardless of the drug type or resistance mechanisms. Concomitant blockade of WNT and MAPK signalling restrains the emergence of drug-resistant clones. Reliance upon the WNT-APC pathway is preserved throughout the branched genomic drift associated with emergence of treatment relapse , thus offering the possibility of a common therapeutic strategy to overcome secondary drug resistance.
