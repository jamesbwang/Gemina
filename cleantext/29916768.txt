  The highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( FMDV) afflicts cloven-hoofed animals , resulting in significant costs because of loss of trade and recovery from disease. We developed a sensitive , specific , and rapid competitive ELISA ( cELISA) to detect serum antibodies to FMDV. The cELISA utilized a monoclonal blocking antibody specific for a highly conserved FMDV nonstructural 3B epitope , a recombinant mutant FMDV 3ABC coating protein , and optimized format variables including serum incubation for 90 min at 20-25 Â°C. Samples from 16 animals experimentally infected with one FMDV serotype ( A , O , Asia , or SAT-1) demonstrated early detection capacity beginning 7 d post-inoculation. All samples from 55 vesicular stomatitis virus antibody-positive cattle and 44 samples from cloven-hoofed animals affected by non-FMD vesicular diseases were negative in the cELISA , demonstrating 100 % analytical specificity. The diagnostic sensitivity was 100 % against sera from 128 cattle infected with isolates of all FMDV serotypes , emphasizing serotype-agnostic results. Diagnostic specificities of U.S. cattle ( n = 1135) and swine ( n = 207) sera were 99.4 % and 100 % , respectively. High repeatability and reproducibility were demonstrated with 3.1 % coefficient of variation in percent inhibition data and 100 % agreement using 2 kit lots and 400 negative control serum samples , with no difference between bench and biosafety cabinet operation. Negative results from vaccinated , uninfected cattle , pig , and sheep sera confirmed the DIVA ( differentiate infected from vaccinated animals) capability. This rapid ( < 3 h) , select agent-free assay with high sensitivity and specificity , DIVA capability , and room temperature processing capability will serve as a useful tool in FMDV surveillance , emergency preparedness , response , and outbreak recovery programs.
