  In June 2008 , WHO launched the Safe Surgery Checklist. Nine months later a Swedish translation and adaptation was launched and distributed to virtually all Swedish hospitals. It gained rapid acceptance; in the fall of 2009 , 73 hospitals reported that the checklist had been implemented and that its use was part of standard routine. A questionnaire in 2010 revealed that this was true for many but not all hospitals. International studies have shown that proper use of the checklist has positive effects on postoperative morbidity and mortality. The studies also show the importance of implementing the checklist thoughtfully , thus resulting in better communication and team formation amongst the operating staff. A checklist can not replace professional competence , but using a checklist is part of professional behaviour.
