  This study examined clergy 's use of 15 suicide prevention competencies. Four hundred ninety-eight U.S. Catholic , Jewish , and Protestant clergy responded to an online survey regarding their use of these competencies. Analysis of variance , backward stepwise regression , and principal components analysis were used to determine clergy group differences , predictors of use of competencies , and a parsimonious summary of competencies. Some respondents reported infrequent opportunities to develop these competencies. Respondents reported using general pastoral competencies more than suicide-specific competencies. Protestant clergy reported that their congregants watch over each other significantly more than Jewish clergy. Catholic and Jewish clergy reported significantly more competence in conducting suicide funerals than Protestant clergy. Contacts by suicidal people and number of hours of suicide-specific training predicted the use of more competencies. Competency components included postvention following a suicide , nonjudgmental attitudes , talking with a suicidal person , and pastoral care. Findings suggest that clergy may benefit from consultation and suicide-specific training.
