  It is argued that the Type D person experiences increased distress when encountering social situations , which results in altered stress responding. However , little is known about how Type D individuals behave or feel during social interactions. Using a within-subjects design , the present study examined the physiological arousal of Type D and non-Type D individuals when rating how they would deal with a number of hypothetical social situations. Results showed that across all social situations , Type D individuals experienced greater levels of discomfort. In clearly negative and ambiguously neutral situations , this was paired with higher pulse rate. This study shows that the Type D individual not only reports greater discomfort but also experiences changes physiologically that support the role of the cardiovascular system as a potential psychosomatic pathway to disease.
