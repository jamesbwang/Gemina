  While alcohol cessation improves mortality in alcoholic liver disease ( ALD) , many patients struggle to achieve abstinence. Our aim was to characterize ALD patients ' preferences , misconceptions , and barriers to alcohol use treatment options. This mixed-methods study included outpatients with a history of alcohol-related cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis<disease> recruited from a hepatology clinic for a survey or an in-depth semi-structured interview. We purposefully sampled men and women , compensated and decompensated patients to ensure adequate representation of gender and severity of liver disease for the qualitative interviews. 123 patients completed surveys among which 50 % reported having at least one drink within the past year while only 20 patients were in any form of current alcohol treatment. Of the 23 patients reporting drinking within 3 months , only 3 were in AUD treatment currently. 17 % had at least one misconception about alcohol use or treatment. An additional 22 ALD patients ( 10 women , 12 men) completed phone interviews of which two-third self-reported alcohol abstinence. All 22 interview participants had awareness of some form of alcohol treatment , but 13 felt that they did not need treatment with several characterizing it as ineffective or a `` waste of time. '' Misconceptions included inaccurate perceptions of relapse medication side effects , beliefs that the presence of advanced liver disease symptoms means it is too late to treat alcohol use , and a lack of understanding about the chronicity of alcohol use disorders. The most common barriers to treatment included unwillingness to be in treatment , financial/insurance and transportation barriers. Alcohol use treatment was underutilized in many ALD patients , despite active drinking in many. Tailored education and preference sensitive treatment engagement may overcome barriers to alcohol use treatment and promote abstinence.
