  Antitumor strategies based on positive modulation of the immune system currently represent therapeutic options with prominent acceptance for cancer patients ' treatment due to its selectivity and higher tolerance compared to chemotherapy. Racotumomab is an anti-idiotype ( anti-Id) monoclonal antibody ( mAb) directed to NeuGc-containing gangliosides such as NeuGcGM3 , a widely reported tumor-specific neoantigen in many human cancers. Racotumomab has been approved in Latin American countries as an active immunotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) treatment. In this work , we evaluated the induction of Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC) in NSCLC patients included in a phase III clinical trial , in response to vaccination with racotumomab. The development of anti-NeuGcGM3 antibodies ( Abs) in serum samples of immunized patients was first evaluated using the NeuGcGM3-expressing X63 cells , showing that racotumomab vaccination developed antigen-specific Abs that are able to recognize NeuGcGM3 expressed in tumor cell membranes<symptom>. ADCC response against NeuGcGM3-expressing X63 ( target) was observed in racotumomab-treated- but not in control group patients. When target cells were depleted of gangliosides by treatment with a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor , we observed a significant reduction of the ADCC activity developed by sera from racotumomab-vaccinated patients , suggesting a target-specific response. Our data demonstrate that anti-NeuGcGM3 Abs induced by racotumomab vaccination are able to mediate an antigen-specific ADCC response against tumor cells in NSCLC patients.
