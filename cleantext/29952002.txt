  Inflammatory processes have been shown to play an important role in the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Innate and adaptive immune responses participate in BP elevation and end-organ damage. Here , we discuss recent studies focusing on novel inflammatory and immune mechanisms that play roles in BP elevation. Different subpopulations of cells involved in innate and adaptive immune responses , such as dendritic cells , monocytes/macrophages and NK cells , on the one hand , and B and T lymphocytes , on the other , contribute to the vascular and kidney injury in hypertension. Unconventional innate-like T cells such as γδ T cells also participate in hypertensive mechanisms by priming both innate and adaptive immune cells , contributing to trigger vascular inflammation<symptom> and BP elevation. These cells exert their effects in part via production of various cytokines including pro-inflammatory IFN-γ and IL-17 and anti-inflammatory IL-10. The present review summarizes some of these immune mechanisms that participate in the pathophysiology of hypertension.
