  Recent studies have reported improved survival in patients with thyroid cancer. This study evaluated the changes in disease-specific survival ( DSS) of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC) in association with clinicopathologic characteristics from 1996 to 2005 in Korea. This was a retrospective , multicenter cohort study. A total of 4398 DTC patients were included , and they were classified according to the year of initial surgery: 1996-2000 ( period 1) , 2001-2003 ( period 2) , and 2004-2005 ( period 3). During the study period , patient age and the proportion of papillary thyroid cancer increased gradually. Primary tumors became smaller ( 2.3 ± 1.4 cm at period 1 to 1.5 ± 1.2 cm at period 3; p < 0.001). The proportion of high-volume lymph node metastases decreased significantly ( 20 % at period 1 to 13 % at period 3; p for trend < 0.001). DSS differed significantly according to period during the median 10 years follow-up ( p = 0.002). The 10-year DSS rates were 98.0 % , 98.7 % , and 99.2 % in periods 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively. After adjusting for various characteristics , the disease-specific mortality risk was significantly lower during period 2 ( hazard ratio = 0.49 ( confidence interval CI 0.25-0.90) , p = 0.021) and period 3 ( hazard ratio = 0.40 ( confidence interval 0.21-0.77) , p = 0.006) compared to that of period 1. This trend was also significant in a subgroup analysis of low ( I-II) and high ( III-IV) TNM stages. The disease-specific mortality of patients with DTC in Korea decreased over time. Earlier detection of small DTCs with less extensive disease and standardization of treatment may be associated with this phenomenon.
