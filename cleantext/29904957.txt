  Osteoarthritis ( OA) significantly influences the quality life of people around the world. It is urgent to find an effective way to understand the genetic etiology of OA. We used weighted gene coexpression network analysis ( WGCNA) to explore the key genes involved in the subchondral bone pathological process of OA. Fifty gene expression profiles of GSE51588 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The OA-associated genes and gene ontologies were acquired from JuniorDoc. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was used to find disease-related networks based on 21756 gene expression correlation coefficients , hub-genes with the highest connectivity in each module were selected , and the correlation between module eigengene and clinical traits was calculated. The genes in the traits-related gene coexpression modules were subject to functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis using ClusterProfiler. A total of 73 gene modules were identified , of which , 12 modules were found with high connectivity with clinical traits. Five modules were found with enriched OA-associated genes. Moreover , 310 OA-associated genes were found , and 34 of them were among hub-genes in each module. Consequently , enrichment results indicated some key metabolic pathways , such as extracellular matrix ( ECM)- receptor interaction ( hsa04512) , focal adhesion ( hsa04510) , the phosphatidylinositol 3 '- kinase ( PI3K)- Akt signaling pathway ( PI3K-AKT) ( hsa04151) , transforming growth factor beta pathway , and Wnt pathway. We intended to identify some core genes , collagen ( COL<pathogen>) 6A3 , COL6A1 , ITGA11 , BAMBI , and HCK , which could influence downstream signaling pathways once they were activated. In this study , we identified important genes within key coexpression modules , which associate with a pathological process of subchondral bone in OA. Functional analysis results could provide important information to understand the mechanism of OA.
