  Packaging the mouse mammary tumor<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( MMTV) genomic RNA ( gRNA) requires the entire 5 ' untranslated region ( UTR) in conjunction with the first 120 nucleotides of the gag gene. This region includes several palindromic ( pal) sequence ( s) and stable stem loops ( SLs). Among these , stem loop 4 ( SL4) adopts a bifurcated structure consisting of three stems , two apical loops , and an internal loop. Pal II , located in one of the apical loops , mediates gRNA dimerization , a process intricately linked to packaging. We thus hypothesized that the bifurcated SL4 structure could constitute the major gRNA packaging determinant. To test this hypothesis , the two apical loops and the flanking sequences forming the bifurcated SL4 were individually mutated. These mutations all had deleterious effects on gRNA packaging and propagation. Next , single and compensatory mutants were designed to destabilize then recreate the bifurcated SL4 structure. A structure-function analysis using bioinformatics predictions and RNA chemical probing revealed that mutations that led to the loss of the SL4 bifurcated structure abrogated RNA packaging and propagation , while compensatory mutations that recreated the native SL4 structure restored RNA packaging and propagation to wild type levels. Altogether , our results demonstrate that SL4 constitutes the principal packaging determinant of MMTV gRNA. Our findings further suggest that SL4 acts as a structural switch that can not only differentiate between RNA for translation versus packaging/dimerization , but its location also allows differentiation between spliced and unspliced RNAs during gRNA encapsidation.
