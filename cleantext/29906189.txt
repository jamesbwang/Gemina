  Electron heating at Earth 's quasiperpendicular bow shock<symptom> has been surmised to be due to the combined effects of a quasistatic electric potential and scattering through wave-particle interaction. Here we report the observation of electron distribution functions indicating a new electron heating process occurring at the leading edge of the shock<symptom> front. Incident solar wind electrons are accelerated parallel to the magnetic field toward downstream , reaching an electron-ion relative drift speed exceeding the electron thermal speed. The bulk acceleration is associated with an electric field pulse embedded in a whistler-mode wave. The high electron-ion relative drift is relaxed primarily through a nonlinear current-driven instability. The relaxed distributions contain a beam traveling toward the shock<symptom> as a remnant of the accelerated electrons. Similar distribution functions prevail throughout the shock<symptom> transition layer , suggesting that the observed acceleration and thermalization is essential to the cross-shock electron heating.
