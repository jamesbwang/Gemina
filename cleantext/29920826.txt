  Heat-shock proteins ( Hsps) and their cognates are primary mitigators of cell stress. With increasingly severe impacts of climate change and other human modifications of the biosphere , the ability of the heat-shock system to affect evolutionary fitness in environments outside the laboratory and to evolve in response is topic of growing importance. Since the last major reviews , several advances have occurred. First , demonstrations of the heat-shock response outside the laboratory now include many additional taxa and environments. Many of these demonstrations are only correlative , however. More importantly , technical advances in `` omic '' quantification of nucleic acids and proteins , genomewide association analysis , and manipulation of genes and their expression have enabled the field to move beyond correlation. Several consequent advances are already evident: The pathway from heat-shock gene expression to stress tolerance in nature can be extremely complex , mediated through multiple biological processes and systems , and even multiple species. The underlying genes are more numerous , diverse and variable than previously appreciated , especially with respect to their regulatory variation and epigenetic changes. The impacts and limitations ( e.g. , due to trade-offs) of natural selection on these genes have become more obvious and better established. At last , as evolutionary capacitors , Hsps may have distinctive impacts on the evolution of other genes and ecological consequences.
