  There are various language adaptations of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children Present and Lifetime Version ( K-SADS-PL). In order to comply with the changes in DSM classification , the Spanish edition of the interview was in need of update and evaluation. K-SADS-PL was adapted to correspond to DSM-5 categories. All clinicians received training , and a 90 % agreement was reached. Patients and their parents or guardians were interviewed and videotaped , and the videos were exchanged between raters. Factor analysis was performed and inter-rater reliability was calculated only in the case of diagnoses in which there were more than five patients. A total of 74 subjects were included. The Factor Analysis yielded six factors ( Depressive , Stress Hyperarousal , Disruptive Behavioral , Irritable Explosive , Obsessive Repetitive and Encopresis) , representing 72 % of the variance. Kappa values for inter-rater agreement were larger than 0.7 for over half of the disorders. The factor structure of diagnoses , made with the instrument was found to correspond to the DSM-5 disorder organization. The instrument showed good construct validity and inter-rater reliability , which makes it a useful tool for clinical research studies in children and adolescents.
