  To evaluate stages of chronic kidney disease ( CKD) by apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) obtained from diffusion weighted imaging ( DWI) using a meta-analysis. Literature databases were searched from PubMed , Web of Science , Cochrane and Embase to identify relevant articles about DWI in CKD between 1999 and 2017. ADC values were extracted from the healthy group and CKD patients with different stages. Meta-analysis was conducted using STATA v. 12.0. A random-effects model was performed to acquire the effect estimate , which was expressed as a pooled weighted mean difference ( WMD) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI). We performed comparisons of ADC values between the following groups: ( 1) the ADC values of the normal kidneys vs earlier Stage 1-2 of CKD; ( 2) Stage 3 vs the Stage 1-2 of CKD; ( 3) the Stage 4-5 vs the Stage 3. Six studies were included in this meta-analysis. The CKD patients with earlier Stage 1-2 showed lower ADC values than the healthy subjects ( WMD = -0.09 , 95 % CI ( -0.12 to -0.06) , p < 0.001). However , no obvious difference in ADC values was found between the Stage 3 and Stage1-2 of CKD ( WMD = -0.09 , 95 % CI ( -0.18 to 0.01) , p = 0.08). The CKD Stage3 had higher ADC values than those of Stage4-5 ( WMD = -0.21 , 95 % CI ( -0.32 to -0.11) , p = 0.01). DWI is an accurate and non-invasive imaging technique for early diagnosis and staging of CKD. Quantitative DWI may potentially play a role in making clinical decisions in the follow-up of CKD. Advances in knowledge DWI can be a valuable tool for staging of CKD.
