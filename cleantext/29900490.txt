  Genetic economy is a key feature in all aspects of viral replication. Some viruses are able to function as independently evolving entities with as few as two genes , while satellite viruses have been described that encode a single gene product. To accommodate the need for genetic economy , the viral infectious entity- the virion , generally assembles in a highly-symmetrical manner. Viral structural proteins are multifunctional , accomplishing several tasks beyond their primary role of forming protective shells. These include mediating attachment and entry , avoiding and regulating host responses to infection and sometimes mediating gene expression and genome replication. Here we introduce some of the basic principles of virus assembly with examples to show how recurring motifs are seen in spherical viruses that infect diverse host species , how some viruses use helical assemblies to encapsidate their genomes and how viral envelope glycoproteins accomplish membrane fusion.
