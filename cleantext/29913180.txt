  Zebrafish is rapidly becoming a key model organism for studying a variety of biological processes from molecules to organisms. Interactions involving actin , a contractile protein and part of the cytoskeleton , are regulated by actin binding proteins in the majority of physiological processes in eukaryotic cells. To understand the contribution of actin proteins to the physiological processes of zebrafish , it is important to identify the diverse isoforms of actin encoded by its genome; however , significant sequence identity complicates isoform assignments. Through a combination of human-directed sequence and functional analysis , we have assigned and performed localization of actc1c , a previously undesignated cardiac actin gene , and propose an updated assignment of Î±-actin protein isoform identities in zebrafish.
