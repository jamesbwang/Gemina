  Acrolein , a highly toxic α , β-unsaturated aldehyde , promotes the progression of atherosclerosis in association with inflammatory signaling pathway and reverse cholesterol transport ( RCT) process. Additionally , hepatic flavin containing monooxygenase 3 ( FMO3) is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by regulating cholesterol metabolism. Hydroxytyrosol ( HT) , as a major phenolic compound in olive oil , exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic activities in vitro and animal models. The current study was designed to evaluate whether FMO3 participated in pro-atherogenic process by acrolein and HT showed protective effect during this process. Here , endothelial cells and macrophage Raw264 .7 cells were used as the cell models. Following oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( OX-LDL) treatment , acrolein exposure promoted foam cells formation in macrophage Raw264 .7 cells. The expression of FMO3 and inflammatory makers such as phospho-NF-κB , IL-1β , TNFα as well as IL-6 were significantly increased. However , ATP-binding cassette transporters subfamily A member 1 ( ABCA1) , a major transporter in RCT process , was repressed by acrolein. In addition , FMO3 knockdown could suppress inflammatory markers and promote ABCA1 expression. Hydroxytyrosol ( HT) was observed to reduce lipid accumulation , FMO3 expression as well as inflammatory response. Moreover , it promoted ABCA1 expression. Therefore , our findings indicated that acrolein-enhanced atherogenesis by increasing FMO3 which increased inflammatory responses and decreased ABCA1 in vitro can be alleviated by HT , which may have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of atherosclerosis.
