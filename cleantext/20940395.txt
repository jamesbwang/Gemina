  Aggressive cancers such as glioblastoma ( GBM) contain intermingled apoptotic cells adjacent to proliferating tumor cells. Nonetheless , intercellular signaling between apoptotic and surviving cancer cells remain elusive. In this study , we demonstrate that apoptotic GBM cells paradoxically promote proliferation and therapy resistance of surviving tumor cells by secreting apoptotic extracellular vesicles ( apoEVs) enriched with various components of spliceosomes. apoEVs alter RNA splicing in recipient cells , thereby promoting their therapy resistance and aggressive migratory phenotype. Mechanistically , we identified RBM11 as a representative splicing factor that is upregulated in tumors after therapy and shed in extracellular vesicles upon induction of apoptosis. Once internalized in recipient cells , exogenous RBM11 switches splicing of MDM4 and Cyclin D1 toward the expression of more oncogenic isoforms.
