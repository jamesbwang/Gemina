  In this work , we studied influences on the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of coumarin-4066 ( C-466) with different solvent polarity scale. The spectral shifts reflect the effect of the equilibrium solvents association across the energized solute particle , which adjusts inertially as a result of quick charge realignment upon radiative deactivation to the lowest electronic state. The dipole moments of C-466 are determined by employing the Bakhshiev , Kawski-Chamma-Viallet , Lippert-Mataga and McRae relations. The results from all these methods are , excited state dipole moment of C-466 is higher than the ground state dipole moments and which indicates molecule is less polar in the ground state. Theoretical analysis was also carried out by Density Functional theory ( DFT and TD- DFT) employing the BECKE-1998 ( exchange)/ STO-6G basic set in ethanol solvent and in vacuum medium. The HOMO-LUMO , Solvent Accessible Surfaces ( SAS) and Molecular Electrostatic Potential ( MEP) were analysed to acquire additional knowledge of the molecular arrangement and electronic properties of C-466. These photophysical properties suggest delineation can be mauled for laying out new luminescent tests for various solvents microenvironment.
