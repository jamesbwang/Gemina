  The purpose of this study was to conduct a youth participatory action research project to address the disparities in sexually transmitted infection ( STI) and HIV<pathogen> rates among homeless youth. Four youth served as co-investigators and cultural informants for the project. The team conducted focus groups ( N = 22; ages 16-22) and in-depth interviews ( N = 20; ages 18-24) with homeless youth to explore decisions about condomless sex , knowledge of STIs and HIV<pathogen> , health-care access for STI-related services , and perceptions about STI testing. Findings revealed that homeless youth have good general knowledge about STIs , are receptive to STI testing for themselves and their sexual partners , and have heightened concerns about being HIV<pathogen> positive and peers knowing their STI status. Results from the current study could contribute to the development of youth-informed tailored interventions to increase protective sexual behavior , reduce health disparities , and improve access to and the quality of health-care services for homeless youth.
