  Phthalate esters are endocrine disrupters that can affect the development of the testis in a species-specific manner. However , their interference in the male gonads of the Mongolian gerbil is unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether gestational exposure to di-n-butyl phthalate ( DBP) interferes with the development of the gerbil testis during the first six weeks of life. Males were evaluated at 1 , 7 , 14 , 28 , 35 and 42 days of age in an untreated ( control) group or groups exposed from 8 to 23 days gestation to DBP ( 100mgkg-1day-1 in mineral oil) or vehicle by maternal gavage. DBP exposure impaired cell proliferation within the seminiferous cords<disease> at birth , but increased proliferation at the end of the first week , when higher testosterone concentrations were observed. The vehicle ( mineral oil) reduced the total number of gonocytes and attenuated the decrease in testosterone concentrations at 7 days. The vehicle also altered gonocyte relocation at 14 days and increased oestrogen concentrations at 28 days by approximately 112 %. In summary , both DBP and oil interfered in gonadal development and testosterone plasma concentrations in the first week of postnatal life. However , the changes observed at the beginning of puberty were not seen after exposure to DBP , indicating a more harmful effect of mineral oil in this period.
