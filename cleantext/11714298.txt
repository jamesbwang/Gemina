  Polyphenolic antioxidants are an integral component of the present-day lifestyle due to growing environmental and pollution-related issues. Gallic acid ( GA) , a popular polyphenolic antioxidant , is widely distributed in different fruits and vegetables. It scavenges free radicals mostly through the hydrogen atom transfer ( HAT) mechanism. The present work reports a fundamental understanding of the atom transfer involved in the antioxidant activity of GA in the presence of prototype oxyradicals. In this article , the behavior of GA in the presence of three prototype oxyradicals , based on the availability in biological systems , viz. hydroxyl ( • OH) , hydroperoxyl ( • OOH) , and methyl peroxyl ( • OOMe) is studied. On radical scavenging , a sharp change in the structural , electronic , and thermodynamic properties of GA is observed. Finally , a new descriptor based on chemical hardness , which describes the stability of the antioxidant molecule during a HAT reaction , is also proposed.
