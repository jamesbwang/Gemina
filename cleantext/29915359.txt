  Faithful chromosome segregation depends on the ability of sister kinetochores to attach to spindle microtubules. The outer layer of kinetochores transiently expands in early mitosis to form a fibrous corona , and compacts following microtubule capture. Here we show that the dynein adaptor Spindly and the RZZ ( ROD-Zwilch-ZW10) complex<pathogen> drive kinetochore expansion in a dynein-independent manner. C-terminal farnesylation and MPS1 kinase activity cause conformational changes of Spindly that promote oligomerization of RZZ-Spindly complexes into a filamentous meshwork in cells and in vitro. Concurrent with kinetochore expansion , Spindly potentiates kinetochore compaction by recruiting dynein via three conserved short linear motifs. Expanded kinetochores unable to compact engage in extensive , long-lived lateral microtubule interactions that persist to metaphase , and result in merotelic attachments and chromosome segregation errors in anaphase. Thus , dynamic kinetochore size regulation in mitosis is coordinated by a single , Spindly-based mechanism that promotes initial microtubule capture and subsequent correct maturation of attachments.
