  Cardiac alternans is a disturbance in heart<symptom> rhythm<symptom> that is linked to the onset of lethal cardiac arrhythmias. Mechanical perturbation control has been recently used to suppress alternans in cardiac tissue of relevant size. In this control strategy , cardiac tissue mechanics are perturbed via active tension generated by the heart 's electrical activity , which alters the tissue 's electric wave profile through mechanoelectric coupling. We analyze the effects of mechanical perturbation on the dynamics of a map model that couples the membrane voltage and active tension systems at the cellular level. Therefore , a two-dimensional iterative map of the heart beat-to-beat dynamics is introduced , and a stability analysis of the system of coupled maps is performed in the presence of a mechanical perturbation algorithm. To this end , a bidirectional coupling between the membrane voltage and active tension systems in a single cardiac cell is provided , and a discrete form of the proposed control algorithm , that can be incorporated in the coupled maps , is derived. In addition , a realistic electromechanical model of cardiac tissue is employed to explore the feasibility of suppressing alternans at cellular and tissue levels. Electrical activity is represented in two detailed ionic models , the Luo-Rudy 1 and the Fox models , while two active contractile tension models , namely a smooth variant of the Nash-Panfilov model and the Niederer-Hunter-Smith model , are used to represent mechanical activity in the heart. The Mooney-Rivlin passive elasticity model is employed to describe passive mechanical behavior of the myocardium.
