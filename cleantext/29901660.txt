  Health care delivery systems , including academic medical centers ( AMCs) , are increasingly focused on improving care for vulnerable , high-need , high-cost patients , in part because value-based payment models offer the promise of financial returns , or the avoidance of losses , for doing so. AMCs and other providers that have participated in Medicare and Medicaid demonstrations and value-based payment programs have important insights to offer about the features of successful and promising programs for high-need , high-cost patients. As more AMCs embrace value-based payment , they may have greater flexibility to provide services that address the medical and non-medical needs of clinically complex patients and thereby reduce avoidable health care utilization. AMCs have many opportunities to create high-performing health systems , establish operational evidence for how to transform delivery systems , and train the next generation of providers to better address the care of high-need , high-cost individuals.
