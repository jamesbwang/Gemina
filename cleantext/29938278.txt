  Some inherent drawbacks of organic cathode materials include low conductivity and high solubility in electrolytes , which lead to low rate capability and low cycling stability. Herein , a novel nanoporous sulfur-bridged hexaazatrinaphthylene ( NSHATN) framework has been developed. The sulfur-bridged aromatic framework has good electrical conductivity and is insoluble in electrolytes. The well-defined nanoporous structure with the pore size dominant at 1.26 nm endows the framework with good ionic conductivity. With that , the NSHATN cathode for lithium ion batteries gives well-balanced electrical performances in capacity , cycling stability and rate capability.
