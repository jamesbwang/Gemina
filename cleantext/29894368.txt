  The burden of gonorrhea<disease> infections in the United States is high. There are marked disparities by race/ethnicity and sexual orientation. We quantified the impact of screening and treatment on gonorrhea<disease> rates in the US population aged 15-39 years for the time period 2000 to 2015 and estimated the impact that alternative screening strategies might have had over the same time period. We developed a national-level transmission model that divides the population by race/ethnicity , preferred sex of sex partners , age , sex , and sexual activity level. We compared our fitted model ( ` base case ') to four alternative strategies: ( i) no screening; ( ii) full adherence to current screening guidelines; ( iii) annual universal screening; or ( iv) enhanced screening in groups with the highest infection burden. Main outcomes were incidence , infections averted , and incidence rate ratios by race/ethnicity. Mean values and 95 % credible intervals ( CrI) were calculated from 1000 draws from parameter posterior distributions. The calibrated model reproduced observed trends in gonorrhea<disease> , including disparities in infection burden by race/ethnicity. We estimated that screening for gonorrhea<disease> from 2000-2015 averted 30 % ( 95 % CrI: 18-44 %) of total infections that would otherwise have occurred. All alternative active screening strategies were estimated to further reduce , but not eliminate , gonorrhea<disease> infections relative to the base case , with differential impacts on the subpopulations of interest. Our model results suggest that screening has reduced gonorrhea<disease> incidence in the US population. Additional reductions in infection burden may have been possible over this time period with increased screening , but elimination was unlikely.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
