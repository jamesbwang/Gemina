  While the issue of whether RNA interference ( RNAi) ever forms part of the antiviral innate immune response in mammalian somatic cells remains controversial , there is considerable evidence demonstrating that few , if any , viral small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs) are produced in infected cells. Moreover , inhibition of RNAi by mutational inactivation of key RNAi factors , such as Dicer or Argonaute 2 , fails to enhance virus replication. One potential explanation for this lack of inhibitory effect is that mammalian viruses encode viral suppressors of RNAi ( VSRs) that are so effective that viral siRNAs are not produced in infected cells. Indeed , a number of mammalian VSRs have been described , of which the most prominent is the influenza<pathogen> A<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( IAV<pathogen>) NS1 protein , which has not only been reported to inhibit RNAi in plants and insects but also to prevent the production of viral siRNAs in IAV-infected human cells. Here , we confirm that an IAV<pathogen> mutant lacking NS1 indeed differs from wild type IAV<pathogen> in that it induces the production of readily detectable levels of Dicer-dependent viral siRNAs in infected human cells. However , we also demonstrate that these siRNAs have little if any inhibitory effect on IAV<pathogen> gene expression. This is likely due , at least in part , to their inefficient loading into the RNA-induced silencing complexes.
