  Menopause is associated with increased cardiovascular disease ( CVD) risk. Arterial stiffness , a biomarker of vascular aging , increases the risk for CVD. The study was aimed to determine whether menopause is associated with arterial stiffness amongst natural and surgical menopausal women. We conducted a cross-sectional study amongst natural postmenopausal women , with Surgical menopause and Premenopausal. Arterial stiffness was measured by Periscopy TM. Large artery stiffness may be an important mechanism by which hysterectomy increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women. Carotid femoral pulse wave velocity ( cfPWV) and Brachial Ankle Pulse wave velocity ( baPWV) were significantly higher in surgical and natural menopause compared to women with Premenopausal group.
