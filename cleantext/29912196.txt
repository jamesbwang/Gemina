  In an effort to increase efficiency in the creation of genetically modified mice via ES Cell methodologies , we present an adaptation to the current blastocyst injection protocol. Here we report that a simple rotation of the embryo , and injection through Trans-Inner cell mass ( TICM) increased the percentage of chimeric mice from 31 % to 50 % , with no additional equipment or further specialized training. 26 different inbred clones , and 35 total clones were injected over a period of 9 months. There was no significant difference in either pregnancy rate or recovery rate of embryos between traditional injection techniques and TICM. Therefore , without any major alteration in the injection process and a simple positioning of the blastocyst and injecting through the ICM , releasing the ES cells into the blastocoel cavity can potentially improve the quantity of chimeric production and subsequent germline transmission.
