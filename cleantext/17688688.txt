  Long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) have been found to play a vital role in several gene regulatory networks involved in the various biological processes in plants related to stress response. However , systematic analyses of lncRNAs expressed in rice Cadmium ( Cd) stress are seldom studied. Thus , we presented the characterization and expression of lncRNAs in rice root development at an early stage in response to Cd stress. The lncRNA deep sequencing revealed differentially expressed lncRNAs among Cd stress and normal condition. In the Cd stress group , 69 lncRNAs were up-regulated and 75 lncRNAs were down-regulated. Furthermore , 386 matched lncRNA-mRNA pairs were detected for 120 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 362 differentially expressed genes in cis , and target gene-related pathway analyses exhibited significant variations in cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway-related genes. For the genes in trans , overall , 28,276 interaction relationships for 144 lncRNAs and differentially expressed protein-coding genes were detected. The pathway analyses found that secondary metabolites , such as phenylpropanoids and phenylalanine , and photosynthesis pathway-related genes were significantly altered by Cd stress. All of these results indicate that lncRNAs may regulate genes of cysteine-rich peptide metabolism in cis , as well as secondary metabolites and photosynthesis in trans , to activate various physiological and biochemical reactions to respond to excessive Cd. The present study could provide a valuable resource for lncRNA studies in response to Cd treatment in rice. It also expands our knowledge about lncRNA biological function and contributes to the annotation of the rice genome.
