  The social brain hypothesis ( SBH) posits that the demands imposed on individuals by living in cohesive social groups exert a selection pressure favouring the evolution of large brains and complex cognitive abilities. Using volumetry and the isotropic fractionator to determine the size of and numbers of neurons in specific brain regions , here we test this hypothesis in African mole-rats ( Bathyergidae). These subterranean rodents exhibit a broad spectrum of social complexity , ranging from strictly solitary through to eusocial cooperative breeders , but feature similar ecologies and life history traits. We found no positive association between sociality and neuroanatomical correlates of information-processing capacity. Solitary species are larger , tend to have greater absolute brain size and have more neurons in the forebrain than social species. The neocortex ratio and neuronal counts correlate negatively with social group size. These results are clearly inconsistent with the SBH and show that the challenges coupled with sociality in this group of rodents do not require brain<symptom> enlargement<symptom> or fundamental reorganization. These findings suggest that group living or pair bonding per se does not select strongly for brain<symptom> enlargement<symptom> unless coupled with Machiavellian interactions affecting individual fitness.
