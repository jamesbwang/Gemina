  Recently , human<pathogen> herpesvirus<pathogen> 6A and 6B ( HHV-6A and HHV-6B) were classified into distinct species. Although these two viruses share many similarities , cell tropism is one of their striking differences , which is partially because of the difference in their entry machinery. Many glycoproteins of HHV-6A/ B have been identified and analyzed in detail , especially in their functions during entry process into host cells. Some of these glycoproteins were unique to HHV-6A/ B. The cellular factors associated with these viral glycoproteins ( or glycoprotein complex) were also identified in recent years. Detailed interaction analyses were also conducted , which could partially prove the difference of entry machinery in these two viruses. Although there are still issues that should be addressed , all the knowledges that have been earned in recent years could not only help us to understand these viruses ' entry mechanism well but also would contribute to the development of the therapy and/or prophylaxis methods for HHV-6A/ B-associated diseases.
