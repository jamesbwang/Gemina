  Literature and art have long depicted God as a stern and elderly white man , but do people actually see Him this way? We use reverse correlation to understand how a representative sample of American Christians visualize the face of God , which we argue is indicative of how believers think about God 's mind. In contrast to historical depictions , Americans generally see God as young , Caucasian , and loving , but perceptions vary by believers ' political ideology and physical appearance. Liberals see God as relatively more feminine , more African American , and more loving than conservatives , who see God as older , more intelligent , and more powerful. All participants see God as similar to themselves on attractiveness , age , and , to a lesser extent , race. These differences are consistent with past research showing that people 's views of God are shaped by their group-based motivations and cognitive biases. Our results also speak to the broad scope of religious differences: even people of the same nationality and the same faith appear to think differently about God 's appearance.
