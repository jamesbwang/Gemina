  Few epidemiological studies presented 12-month and lifetime prevalence estimates for DSM-IV mental disorders in the adult general population by sex and age up to very old age. From 2007 to 2010 , DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed with the DIA-X/M-CIDI among N = 2400 participants ( aged 29-89 years) from the Study of Health in Pomerania , an epidemiological study based on a two-stage stratified cluster sample randomly drawn from the adult general population in northeastern Germany. 36.3 % of the sample was affected by any 12-month and 54.8 % by any lifetime mental disorder. The most frequent diagnostic groups were anxiety<symptom> ( 12-month: 14.8 % , lifetime: 23.4 %) , substance use ( 12-month: 14.5 % , lifetime: 25.0 %) , somatoform ( 12-month: 12.9 % , lifetime: 20.4 %) and depressive ( 12-month: 7.3 % , lifetime: 18.6 %) disorders. Except for substance use ( higher prevalence in men) and bipolar disorders ( comparable prevalence in men and women) , higher 12-month and lifetime prevalence estimates were found in women vs. men. Moreover , lower 12-month and lifetime prevalence estimates were found in older ( aged 60-74 or 75-89 years) vs. younger ( aged 29-44 or 45-59 years) age groups. 22.6 % ( men: 21.1 % , women: 23.9 %) of those affected by any 12-month disorder met criteria for two and 13.6 % ( men: 9.6 % , women: 16.9 %) for three or more 12-month diagnoses. Similarly , 26.4 % ( men: 25.7 % , women: 26.9 %) of those affected by any lifetime disorder met criteria for two and 22.7 % ( men: 19.6 % , women: 25.2 %) for three or more lifetime diagnoses. Our findings demonstrate the frequency of mental disorders in northeastern Germany and emphasize the need for continued prevention and intervention efforts.
