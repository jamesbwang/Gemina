  The use of a unique riboprobe named ` polyprobe ' , carrying partial sequences of different plant viruses or viroids fused in tandem , has permitted the polyvalent detection of up to ten different pathogens by using a non-radioactive molecular hybridization procedure. In the present analysis , we have developed a unique polyprobe with the capacity to detect all members of the Potyvirus genus , which we have named ` genus-probe ' ( GP). To do this , we have exploited the capacity of the molecular hybridization assay to cross-hybridize with related sequences by reducing the hybridization temperature. We observed that sequences showing a percentage similarity of 68 % or higher , could be detected with the same probe by hybridizing at 50-55ÂºC , with a detection limit of picograms of viral RNA comparable to the specific individual probes. According to this , we developed several polyvalent polyprobes , containing 3 , 5 or 7 different 500-nucleotide fragments of a conserved region of the NIb gene. The polyprobe carrying 7 different conserved regions was able to detect all the 32 potyviruses assayed in the present work with no signal in the healthy tissue , indicating the potential capacity of the polyprobe to detect all described , and probably uncharacterized , potyviruses being then considered as a genus-probe. The use of this technology in routine diagnosis not only for Potyvirus but also to other viral genera is discussed.
