  Limited research exists examining the biopsychosocial experience of patients diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC) , a disease commonly associated with a poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to describe rates and types of distress in mRCC patients and explore the relationship between distress and overall survival. A cohort of 102 patients with mRCC treated at a single institution was assessed by a touch screen-based instrument comprising 22 core items spanning physical , practical , functional , and emotional domains. Association between biopsychosocial distress and clinicopathologic criteria was interrogated. Overall survival was compared between patients with low distress versus high distress.ResultHigh rates of distress ( 20.7 %) were found among patients newly diagnosed with mRCC. Among those domains contributing to distress , pain , fatigue<symptom> , and financial comorbidity were the most commonly reported by patients with mRCC. A trend toward poorer overall survival in those patients with high distress versus low distress was observed among mRCC patients.Significance of resultsBased on data from a relatively large sample of patients , this study provides the first specific insights into the potential impact of biopsychosocial distress and outcomes among patients with mRCC.
