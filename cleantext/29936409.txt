  The unique properties of chlorosomes , arising out of the self-assembled bateriochlorophyll ( BChl) c structure , have made them attractive for use in solar cells. In this work , we have demonstrated the self-assembly of BChl c in aerosolized droplets to mimic naturally occurring chlorosomes. We compare two different methods for self-assembly of BChl c , one using a single-solvent and the other using two-solvents , and demonstrate the superiority of the two-solvent method. Results show that the self-assembled BChl c sprayed at different concentrations resulted in a varying red shift of 69-75 nm in absorption spectrum compared to the solution , which has peak at 668 nm corresponding to the monomeric BChl c. The sample fluoresces at 780 nm indicating a quality of self-assembly comparable to that observed in naturally occurring chlorosomes. In order to mimic chlorosomes , solution containing BChl c , BChl a , lipids and carotenes in same proportion as in chlorosomes is sprayed. The resulting self-assembly has an absorption peak at 750 nm , shifted by 82 nm compared to that of monomers and the fluorescence peak at 790 nm. Thus in presence of lipids and carotenes , both the absorption and fluorescence peaks are red shifted. Further , using grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering ( GISAXS) , we characterized the deposited films , and the 2D X-ray scattering patterns of sample clearly indicate the distinct lamellar structure as present in chlorosomes. The results of this work provide new insights into self-assembly in aerosolized droplets , which can be used for assembling a wide range of molecules.
