  RNA is emerging as a key regulator of a plethora of biological processes. While its study has remained elusive for decades , the recent advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies provided the unique opportunity to develop novel techniques for the study of RNA structure and post-transcriptional modifications. Nonetheless , most of the required downstream bioinformatics analyses steps are not easily reproducible , thus making the application of these techniques a prerogative of few laboratories. Here we introduce RNA Framework , an all-in-one toolkit for the analysis of most NGS-based RNA structure probing and post-transcriptional modification mapping experiments. To prove the extreme versatility of RNA Framework , we applied it to both an in-house generated DMS-MaPseq dataset , and to a series of literature available experiments. Notably , when starting from publicly available datasets , our software easily allows replicating authors ' findings. Collectively , RNA Framework provides the most complete and versatile toolkit to date for a rapid and streamlined analysis of the RNA epistructurome.
