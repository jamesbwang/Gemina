  Previous research has shown that stimulus pull is one of the contributory factors influencing Thematic Apperception Test ( TAT) responses. In recent years , there has been a resurgence of studies examining this. In particular , the Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale-Global Rating Method ( SCORS-G) has been employed to examine stimulus pull in adult clinical and nonclinical samples. The present study is the first attempt to examine this issue in a nonclinical sample of children. Ninety-eight children from Italian elementary ( 1st to 5th grade) and middle ( 6th to 8th grade) schools provided narratives to six TAT cards ( 1 , 2 , 3BM , 4 , 8BM , and 16). Some important findings with regard to variance within scales replicate prior findings from other studies. Furthermore , some findings regarding the specific nature of pull for particular TAT cards ( 1 , 2 , 3BM , and 4) replicate prior work. Given that Cards 8BM and 16 's SCORS-G stimulus properties have not been previously studied , the pull of these cards is explored. Last , SCORS-G differences/similarities across these two age groups are highlighted. Suggestions for further research in this field are also provided , particularly concerning the use of SCORS-G and TAT for clinical assessment.
