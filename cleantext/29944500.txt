  To report the indications , outcomes , and complications of therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty ( Th PK) in patients with corneal perforation and/or nonhealing corneal ulceration. A retrospective review was conducted of 51 eyes of 51 patients undergoing Th PK between January 1 , 2006 and April 15 , 2016. Data collected included patient demographics , visual acuity ( VA) , size of the corneal infiltrate and epithelial defect , degree of corneal thinning/perforation , microbiological results , surgical details , and postoperative complications. The average age at presentation was 56.0 years ( range 6-92 years) , and most of the patients were females ( n = 31 , 60.8 %). Th PK was performed for corneal perforation in 28 eyes ( 54.9 % of cases) , nonhealing corneal ulcer<disease> in 16 eyes ( 31.4 % of cases) , and imminent risk of corneal perforation in 7 eyes ( 13.7 % of cases). Infection was the most common reason for performing a Th PK and was present in 92.3 % ( 47/51) of all cases. Of the infectious cases , the most common etiologies were bacterial ( 44.7 % , 21/47) and fungal ( 31.9 % , 15/47). The most common identifiable risk factor for undergoing a Th PK was a history of contact lens wear , which was seen in 32.7 % of patients. Initial anatomic success was achieved in all patients after performing Th PK. Most patients ( 33/51; 64.7 %) had clear grafts at their last follow-up examination. There was an improvement in VA in 70.2 % ( 33/47 , where data were available) of the patients at the final postoperative visit compared with the preoperative visit. Average best postoperative VA ( 1.14 ± 0.88 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution ( LogMAR); 20/276) was significantly better than the presenting ( 1.98 ± 0.68 LogMAR; 20/1910) and preoperative ( 2.18 ± 0.55 LogMAR; 20/3 ,027) visual acuities ( P < 0.0001). The most common complication after Th PK was cataract , which was present in 81.8 % ( 27/33) of phakic eyes in which lens status could be assessed , followed by graft failure ( 47.1 %; 24/51) , and secondary glaucoma ( 45.1 %; 23/51). Five eyes developed infection in the therapeutic graft , four eyes had persistent corneal epithelial defect at their last follow-up visit , and two eyes underwent evisceration. Therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty achieves anatomic success and it is a useful procedure for restoring a stable cornea in cases in which infection fails to heal or when the cornea perforates. Furthermore , Th PK achieves corneal clarity and improves vision in most patients.
