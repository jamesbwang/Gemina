  Understanding the capillary filling behaviors in nanopores is crucial for many science and engineering problems. Compared with the classical Bell-Cameron-Lucas-Washburn ( BCLW) theory , anomalous coefficient is always observed because of the increasing role of surfaces. Here , a molecular kinetics approach is adopted to explain the mechanism of anomalous behaviors at the molecular level; a unified model taking account of the confined liquid properties ( viscosity and density) and slip boundary condition is proposed to demonstrate the macroscopic consequences , and the model results are successfully validated against the published literature. The results show that ( 1) the effective viscosity induced by the interaction from the pore wall , as a function of wettability and the pore dimension ( nanoslit height or nanotube diameter) , may remarkably slow down the capillary filling process more than theoretically predicted. ( 2) The true slip , where water molecules directly slide on the walls , strongly depends on the wettability and will increase as the contact angle increases. In the hydrophilic nanopores , though , the magnitude may be comparable with the pore dimensions and promote the capillary filling compared with the classical BCLW model. ( 3) Compared with the other model , the proposed model can successfully predict the capillary filling for both faster or slower capillary filling process; meanwhile , it can capture the underlying physics behind these behaviors at the molecular level based on the effective viscosity and slippage. ( 4) The surface effects have different influence on the capillary filling in nanoslits and nanotubes , and the relative magnitude will change with the variation of wettability as well as the pore dimension.
