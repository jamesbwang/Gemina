  Because deterioration in overall metabolic health underlies multiple complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus , a substantial overlap among risk factors for the complications exists , and this makes the outcomes difficult to distinguish. We hypothesized each risk factor had two roles: describing the extent of deteriorating overall metabolic health and signaling a particular complication the patient is progressing towards. We aimed to examine feasibility of our proposed methodology that separates these two roles , thereby , improving interpretation of predictions and helping prioritize which complication to target first. To separate these two roles , we built models for six complications utilizing Multi-Task Learning-a machine learning technique for modeling multiple related outcomes by exploiting their commonality-in 80 % of EHR data ( N = 9,793) from a university hospital and validated them in remaining 20 % of the data. Additionally , we externally validated the models in claims and EHR data from the OptumLabs â„¢ Data Warehouse ( N = 72,720). Our methodology successfully separated the two roles , revealing distinguishing outcome-specific risk factors without compromising predictive performance. We believe that our methodology has a great potential to generate more understandable thus actionable clinical information to make a more accurate and timely prognosis for the patients.
