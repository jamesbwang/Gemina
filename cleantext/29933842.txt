  The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps induced by antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies has been implicated in the pathogenesis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis. Kraaij et al. now provide evidence that excessive neutrophil extracellular trap formation in vitro induced by sera from patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis is associated with active disease but is not dependent on the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies.
