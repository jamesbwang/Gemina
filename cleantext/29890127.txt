  A simple and rapid identity test of adeno-associated virus ( AAV) serotypes is important for supporting the AAV gene therapy development , as it relates to its efficacy and safety. The current mass spectrometry-based identity tests require extensive sample preparation steps , relatively large sample quantities and long analysis time. Herein , we describe a simple and novel microfluidic ZipChip CE/MS method used to characterize AAV capsid proteins. The three capsid proteins of AAV2 were separated and identified within 4 min using 5 nL of sample directly from a polysorbate-containing formulation buffer. This rapid method can be suitable to confirm AAV serotype identity.
