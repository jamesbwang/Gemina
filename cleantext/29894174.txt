  The potential effect of changing to a nonfossil fuel vehicle fleet was investigated by measuring primary emissions ( by extractive sampling of bus plumes) and secondary mass formation , using a Gothenburg Potential Aerosol Mass ( Go: PAM) reactor , from 29 in-use transit buses. Regarding fresh emissions , diesel ( DSL) buses without a diesel particulate filter ( DPF) emitted the highest median mass of particles , whereas compressed natural gas ( CNG) buses emitted the lowest (
