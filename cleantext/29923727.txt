  Optical nanoantennas can concentrate light and enhance light-matter interactions in subwavelength domain , which is useful for photodetection , light emission , optical biosensing , and spectroscopy. However , conventional optical nanoantennas operating at a single wavelength band are not suitable for multiband applications. Here , we propose and exploit an out-of-plane plasmonic engineering strategy to design and create composite optical nanoantennas that can support multiple nanolocalized modes at different resonant wavelengths. These multiresonant composite nanoantennas are composed of vertically stacked building blocks of metal-insulator-metal loop nanoantennas. Studies of multiresonant composite nanoantennas demonstrate that the number of supported modes depends on the number of vertically stacked building blocks and the resonant wavelengths of individual modes are tunable by controlling the out-of-plane geometries of their building blocks. In addition , numerical studies show that the resonant wavelengths of individual modes in composite nanoantennas can deviate from the optical response of building blocks due to hybridization of magnetic modes in neighboring building blocks. Using Au nanohole arrays as deposition masks to fabricate arrays of multilayered composite nanoantennas , we experimentally demonstrate their multiresonant optical properties in good agreement with theory predictions. These studies show that out-of-plane engineered multiresonant composite nanoantennas can provide new opportunities for fundamental nanophotonics research and practical applications involving optical multiband operations , such as multiphoton process , broadband solar energy conversion , and wavelength-multiplexed optical system.
