  Although there is a general agreement on the recommendation for reduced salt intake as a public health issue , the mechanism by which high salt intake triggers pathological effects on the cardio-renal axis is not completely understood. Emerging evidence indicates that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS) is the main target of high Na + intake. An inappropriate activation of tissue RAAS may lead to hypertension and organ damage. We reviewed the impact of high salt intake on the RAAS on the cardio-renal axis highlighting the molecular pathways that leads to injury effects. We also provide an assessment of recent observational studies related to the consequences of non-osmotically active Na + accumulation , breaking the paradigm that high salt intake necessarily increases plasma Na + concentration promoting water retention.
