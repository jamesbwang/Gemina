  Although prestorage leucoreduction ( LR) of blood components for transfusion has gained favour around the world , evidence of its beneficial clinical effects is ambiguous. To reveal whether leucocytes and/or platelets in transfused blood are related to transfusion-related adverse effects , a prospective randomized crossover study was performed on patients who donated autologous blood prior to elective surgery. Among 1487 primary enrolees , a total of 192 patients undergoing two-stage , bilateral total hip arthroplasty were randomized to receive autologous blood that was either prestorage leucoreduced , or not , for the first procedure. For the second procedure , each patient was crossed over to receive alternatively processed autologous blood. Length of hospital stay served as a primary end-point , with perioperative infectious/thrombotic complications , pre- and postoperative laboratory values , and body temperature serving as secondary endpoints. No significant differences emerged between prestorage LR and non-LR cohorts in length of hospital stay , as well as perioperative infectious/thrombotic complications , postoperative body temperature and duration of fever<disease> Postoperative laboratory values including white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels had no significant differences. This study could not prove any superiority of prestorage LR over non-LR for autologous whole blood among patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty.
