  False-negative cell-free DNA ( cfDNA) screening results involving Down syndrome<disease> are rare , but have high clinical impact on patients and their healthcare providers. Understanding the biology behind these results may allow for improved diagnostic follow-up and counseling. In 5 different centers offering cfDNA prenatal screening , 9 false-negative results were documented in 646 confirmed cases of trisomy 21; a false-negative rate of 1.4 % ( 95 % CI , 0.7-2.6). False-negative results included 4 cases of classical trisomy 21 and 5 cases with a de novo 21q; 21q rearrangement. Two out of five rearrangements had molecular studies and were confirmed as isochromosomes. When combined with reports from the cfDNA screening literature , 8 out of 29 ( 28 %) Down syndrome<disease> cases with a false-negative `` non-invasive prenatal test '' ( NIPT) were associated with a 21q; 21q rearrangement , compared with 2 % reported in live born children with Down syndrome<disease>. In our laboratory series , evidence for placental or fetal mosaicism was present in 3 out of 3 true-positive cases involving a 21q; 21q rearrangement and was confirmed in one false-negative case where placental material was available for study. Isochromosome 21q rearrangements are thus overrepresented among false-negative cfDNA screening results involving Down syndrome<disease>. Postzygotic isochromosome formation leading to placental mosaicism provides a biological cause for the increased prevalence of these rearrangements among false-negative cases. For clinical practice , a low trisomic fraction ( z-score or equivalent measure) relative to the fetal fraction suggests placental mosaicism. Care should be taken as these cases may not reflect confined placental mosaicism , but rather full trisomy in the presence of a placenta containing normal cells.
