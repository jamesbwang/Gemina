  Clinical genomics , involving the examination of an individual 's genetic material , is becoming more frequently used in healthcare. Increasingly , genomic testing is providing information that is relevant to clinical management and decision-making. Some healthcare professions , such as medicine and nursing , are integrating clinical genomics competencies into their educational frameworks to enable practitioners to work safely with patients and families who have had or require genomic testing. The uptake of clinical genomics within healthcare is of interest to physical therapist practice worldwide because of a growing direct-to-consumer accessibility to testing and the potential for such information to influence patient care as some genetic variants have been linked to many common conditions. Such advances highlight the healthcare potential of clinical genomics , and while further studies are required to confirm the clinical utility of these discoveries , the physical therapy profession needs to remain cognisant of such developments and prepare accordingly. In response to the increased adoption of clinical genomics within healthcare practice and education , it is suggested that the physical therapy community needs to consider how clinical genomics may be integrated into physical therapy practice , and how the profession may help guide the integration of such skills. This should take into account several elements that affect clinical practice , including: understanding what ` clinical genomics ' is; recognizing who may benefit from clinical genomics; the cultural , ethical , and legal implications of clinical genomics in practice; and the potential to inform treatment decisions from clinical genomics information. Discussion surrounding the integration of clinical genomics competencies within the physical therapy profession is required to both illuminate and determine its professional practise role and boundaries in response to this increasingly relevant element of healthcare.
