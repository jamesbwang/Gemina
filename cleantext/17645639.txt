  There are animal species that have adapted to life at high altitude and hypobaric hypoxia conditions in the Andean highlands. One such species is the llama ( Lowland and highland newborn sheep and llama were investigated near sea level and at high altitude. Blood determinations of arterial blood gases , ADMA and homocyste√≠ne are made and the effect of these on the arginase activity was evaluated. The basal concentrations of ADMA and homocysteine were determined in llama , and they were found to be significantly lower than those found in other species and in addition , the exposure to hypoxia is unable to increase its concentration. On the other hand , it was observed that the llama exhibited 10 times less arginase II activity as compared to sheep , and the expression was not induced by hypoxia. Finally , ADMA y Hcy , has no effect on the type II arginase pathway. Based on our results , we propose that low concentrations of ADMA and homocysteine found in llamas , the low expression of arginase type II , DDAH-2 and CBS , as well as its insensitivity to activation by homocysteine could constitute an adaptation mechanism of these animals to the hypoxia.
