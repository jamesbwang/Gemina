  To describe , for a national sample of midlife and older adults , the types of complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM) used for health and wellness and the perceived benefits of CAM use by race/ethnicity. Using data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey , we ran multiple logistic regression models to estimate the odds of each perceived benefit among adults ages 50 and older. More than 38 % of midlife and older adults used CAM in the past year. For six of seven perceived benefits examined , we found significant differences by race/ethnicity , with each group having higher odds of two or more perceived benefits compared with non-Hispanic Whites. Although racial/ethnic minority groups are less likely to use CAM compared with non-Hispanic Whites , those who use CAM perceive great benefit. Future research should examine the potential contribution of evidence-based CAM to promoting health and well-being in a diverse aging population.
