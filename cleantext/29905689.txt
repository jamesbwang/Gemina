  A dual-wavelength fiber laser is proposed by the use of Er/Yb co-doped active fiber and a pair of novel Bragg-grating reflectors. The Bragg grating presents strong reflections of both third and second harmonics in accordance with the gain of ytterbium and erbium ion , respectively , enabling the laser emitted at 1.06 μm and 1.55 μm wavebands simultaneously with a short linear cavity structure. Adjusting reflectivity of the harmonics in the grating can influence the intensity contrast of the two lasing signals. Optimization on the compactness and brightness of the laser is achieved by adapting the harmonic wavelengths with the optimal gain windows of the ytterbium and erbium ions.
