  We proposed a FRET immunosensing for detection of CA15-3 tumor marker by highly biospecific interactions between CA 15-3 antigen and the corresponding antibody and aptamer. In this sandwich type immunoassay , CA15-3 antibody-functionalized carbon dots and AuNPs labeled PAMAM-Dendrimer/aptamer were used as donor/acceptor , respectively. When CA 15-3 Ag was added to homogenous immunoassay , the strong complex interaction between CA15-3 Ab-CA15-3 Ag- aptamer caused in more coming closer carbon dot and AuNPs and more decreasing fluorescence signal. The decreased fluorescence intensity was linear at three ranges including in concentration range 1.1 Î¼UmL
