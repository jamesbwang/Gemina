  In broiler chickens , the intense genetic selection for rapid growth has resulted in an increase in growth rate and fat deposition. Adipose tissue is now recognized as an important endocrine organ that secretes a variety of factors including adipokines. However , the expression pattern of these adipokines is unclear in chicken embryo development. In the present study , we determined the expression profile of three novel adipokines , NAMPT , RARRES2 and ADIPOQ , and their cognate receptors in metabolic tissues ( liver , muscles and adipose tissue) of chicken embryo/chicks from 15 days of incubation ( E15) to hatching ( D0). From E15 to hatching , embryos gradually gained weight and started to develop subcutaneous adipose tissue at E15. We conducted western blot and RT-qPCR tests and found that ADIPOQ expression increased over time and was positively correlated with adipose tissue weight. In addition , NAMPT expression increased only in muscles. By using a new homemade chicken RARRES2 specific antibody we showed that RARRES2 protein levels increased specifically at hatching in adipose tissue , liver and pectoralis major and this was associated with an increase in the weight of embryo. Taken together , these results support a potential involvement of adipokines in metabolic regulation during chicken embryo development.
