  Phenyllactic acid ( PLA) is a high-value compound , which was usually produced by lactic acid bacteria ( LAB) as biocatalysts and glucose or phenylpyruvic acid ( PPA) as starting materials for PLA synthesis in previous studies. However , the PLA produced using LAB is a racemic mixture. Besides , both glucose and PPA were unsatisfactory substrates , as the former could not produce high concentrations of PLA while the latter is not a renewable and green substrate. To overcome these drawbacks , in this study , a new biotransformation process was developed for chiral PLA production from L-phenylalanine via the intermediate PPA using recombinant Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> co-expressing L-amino acid deaminase , NAD-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase or NAD-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase , and formate dehydrogenase. After optimization , the recombinant E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> produced L- and D-PLA at concentrations of 59.9 and 60.3 mM in 6 h , respectively. Hence , this process provides an effective and promising alternative method for chiral PLA production.
