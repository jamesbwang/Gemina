  Although most medical treatments are designed for the average patient with a one-size-fits-all-approach , they may not benefit all. Better understanding of the function of genes , proteins , and metabolite , and of personal and environmental factors has led to a call for personalized medicine. Personalized reproductive medicine is still in its infancy , without clear guidance on treatment aspects that could be personalized and on trial design to evaluate personalized treatment effect and benefit-harm balance<symptom>. While the rationale for a personalized approach often relies on retrospective analyses of large observational studies or real-world data , solid evidence of superiority of a personalized approach will come from randomized trials comparing outcomes and safety between a personalized and one-size-fits-all strategy. A more efficient , targeted randomized trial design may recruit only patients or couples for which the personalized approach would differ from the previous , standard approach. Multiple monocenter studies using the same study protocol ( allowing future meta-analysis) might reduce the major center effect associated with multicenter studies. In certain cases , single-arm observational studies can generate the necessary evidence for a personalized approach. This review describes each of the main segments of patient care in assisted reproductive technologies treatment , addressing which aspects could be personalized , emphasizing current evidence and relevant study design.
