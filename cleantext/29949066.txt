  Difficult ethical issues arise for patients and professionals in medical genetics , and often relate to the patient 's family or their social context. Tackling these issues requires sensitivity to nuances of communication and a commitment to clarity and consistency. It also benefits from an awareness of different approaches to ethical theory. Many of the ethical problems encountered in genetics relate to tensions between the wishes or interests of different people , sometimes even people who do not ( yet) exist or exist as embryos , either in an established pregnancy or in vitro. Concern for the long-term welfare of a child or young person , or possible future children , or for other members of the family , may lead to tensions felt by the patient ( client) in genetic counselling. Differences in perspective may also arise between the patient and professional when the latter recommends disclosure of information to relatives and the patient finds that too difficult , or when the professional considers the genetic testing of a child , sought by parents , to be inappropriate. The expectations of a patient 's community may also lead to the differences in perspective between patient and counsellor. Recent developments of genetic technology permit genome-wide investigations. These have generated additional and more complex data that amplify and exacerbate some pre-existing ethical problems , including those presented by incidental ( additional sought and secondary) findings and the recognition of variants currently of uncertain significance , so that reports of genomic investigations may often be provisional rather than definitive. Experience is being gained with these problems but substantial challenges are likely to persist in the long term.
