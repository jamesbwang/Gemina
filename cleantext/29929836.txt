  Neuropathy and neuropathic pain are common complications of type 1 diabetes ( T1D). We aimed to determine if sex-specific differences in neuropathic pain are present in adults with longstanding T1D. Canadians with ≥ 50 years of T1D ( n = 361) completed health history questionnaires that included assessment of neuropathy ( defined by Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument questionnaire components ≥ 3; NEUROPATHY Participants had mean age 66 ± 9 years , median diabetes duration 53 ( 51,58) years , mean HbA1c 7.5 ± 1.0 % , and 207 ( 57 %) were female. Neuropathic pain was present in 128 ( 36 %) of all participants , more prevalent among those with NEUROPATHY We demonstrated a novel sex-specific difference in neuropathic pain in females compared to males with longstanding T1D , independent of the presence of neuropathy. Further research using more objective measures of neuropathy than the MNSI is justified to further understand this sex-specific difference.
