  This report describes the design and printing of personalized nasal stents for cleft lip using 3-dimensional ( 3D) technology. We used silicone rubber to make the impressions , a 3D laser scanner to obtain 3D data , and Dental SG resin cartridges as printing material. We printed the personalized nasal stents using a photosensitive resin printer. We placed the stents in patients after cleft lip surgery. They enabled personalized adjustment and good anastomosis , with a low probability of slipping from the nasal cavity. With this technique , we can provide good nasal support for patients with cleft lip.
