  We tested the hypothesis that ( i) diet associated with exercise would improve arterial baroreflex ( ABR) control in metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) patients with and without obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) and ( ii) the effects of this intervention would be more pronounced in patients with OSA. Forty-six MetS patients without ( noOSA) and with OSA ( apnea-hypopnea index , AHI > 15 events/h) were allocated to no treatment ( control , C) or hypocaloric diet (- 500 kcal/day) associated with exercise ( 40 min , bicycle exercise , 3 times/week) for 4 months ( treatment , T) , resulting in four groups: noOSA-C ( n = 10) , OSA-C ( n = 12) , noOSA-T ( n = 13) , and OSA-T ( n = 11). Muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( MSNA) , beat-to-beat BP , and spontaneous arterial baroreflex function of MSNA ( ABR No significant changes occurred in C groups. In contrast , treatment in both patients with and without OSA led to a significant decrease in weight ( P < 0.05) and the number of MetS factors ( P = 0.03). AHI declined only in the OSA-T group ( 31 ± 5 to 17 ± 4 events/h , P < 0.05). Systolic BP decreased in both treatment groups , and diastolic BP decreased significantly only in the noOSA-T group. Treatment decreased MSNA in both groups. Compared with baseline , ABR Diet associated with exercise improves baroreflex control of sympathetic nerve activity and MetS components in patients with MetS regardless of OSA.
