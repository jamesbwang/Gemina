  To evaluate if midtrimester maternal serum contains microbial DNA and whether it differs between women with spontaneous preterm birth ( SPTB) and those delivering at term. In this retrospective case-control study , we identified 20 healthy nulliparas with SPTB at 24-33 weeks of a nonanomalous singleton in 2014. Each case was matched by race/ethnicity to a control delivering at 39-40 weeks. Serum samples , collected at 15-20 weeks and stored at -80 C , were thawed and DNA extracted. PCR with primers targeting the 16S rDNA V4 region were used to prepare an amplicon library , sequenced using Illumina MiSeq , and analyzed using quantitative insight into microbial ecology ( QIIME). Taxonomy was assigned using Ribosomal Database program ( RDP) Classifier ( threshold 0.8) against a modified Greengenes database. Differences in number of observed species , microbial alpha-diversity and beta-diversity , and taxa level analyses were undertaken. All 40 samples were included. Women with SPTB had more unique observed species ( p = .046) and higher mean alpha-diversity by Shannon index ( but not Chao1 or Simpson) ( p = .024). Microbial composition was different between groups by Bray-Curtis clustering ( p = .03) but not by weighted ( p = .13) or unweighted Unifrac ( p = .11). Numerous taxa in the Firmicutes , Proteobacteria , and Actinobacteria phyla differed between groups ( p < .05). SPTB is associated with distinct microbial DNA changes detected in midtrimester maternal serum.
