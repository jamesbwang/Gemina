  The East Antarctic Ice Sheet ( EAIS) is the largest potential contributor to sea-level rise. However , efforts to predict the future evolution of the EAIS are hindered by uncertainty in how it responded to past warm periods , for example , during the Pliocene epoch ( 5.3 to 2.6 million years ago) , when atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were last higher than 400 parts per million. Geological evidence indicates that some marine-based portions of the EAIS and the West<disease> Antarctic Ice Sheet retreated during parts of the Pliocene
