  Pathogenesis and progression of liver cancer are correlated with inflammatory response and estrogen level. 17β-estradiol dehydrogenase IV ( HSD17B4) is highly expressed in human liver cancer tissues. HSD17B4 participates in liver cancer cell proliferation via suppressing estradiol ( E2) activity. This study generated a rat liver cancer model , on which the correlations between HSD17B4 and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6) , proliferating cell nucleus antigen ( PCNA) expression were analyzed. Male Sprague Dawley ( SD) rats were randomly assigned into control and model group ( N = 30). Diethylnitrosamine was used to induce liver cancer in a rat model. HE staining was used to observe liver injury whilst ELISA was used to measure serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels. The level of serum E2 was quantified by radioimmunoassay. Serum liver function indexes were measured by automatic biochemical analyzer. Protein expressions of HSD17B4 , p-Akt , p-ERK and PCNA were measured by Western blot. The inflammatory infiltration and necrosis<symptom> of hepatocytes were shown in model group by HE staining , along with aggravated liver indexes. Significantly high phosphorylation level of Akt and ERK , along with the increase of HSD17B3 and PCNA expressions , was found in model group ( p < 0.05 compared to control group). Serum E2 level was statistically decreased , whilst TNF-α and IL-6 were up-regulated ( p < 0.05). HSD17B4 was positively correlated with TNF-α , IL-6 and PCNA expressions ( r = 0.68 , 0.62 and 0.56 , p < 0.05). HSD17B4 is over-expressed in rat liver cancer tissues. Its expression was positively correlated with TNF-α , IL-6 and PCNA levels , and probably participates in liver cancer cell proliferation via ERK and Akt signal pathway.
