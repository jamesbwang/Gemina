  Essentials The pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( ITP) has not been fully clarified. We analyzed the role of anti-αvβ3 autoantibody in the pathogenesis of ITP in patients. Anti-αvβ3 autoantibody impeded megakaryocyte migration and adhesion to the vascular niche. Anti-α Background The pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( ITP) has not been fully clarified. Anti-αvβ3 integrin autoantibody is detected in chronic ITP patients , but its contribution to ITP is still unclear. Objectives To clarify the potential role of anti-αvβ3 integrin autoantibody in chronic ITP and the related mechanism. Methods Relationship between levels of anti-αvβ3 autoantibody and platelets in chronic ITP patients was evaluated. The influence of anti-αvβ3 antibody on megakaryocyte ( MK) survival , differentiation , migration and adhesion was assessed , and the associated signal pathways were investigated. Platelet recovery and MKs ' distribution were observed in an ITP mouse model pretreated with different antibodies. Result In this study , we showed that the anti-αvβ3 autoantibody usually coexists with anti-αIIbβ3 autoantibody in chronic ITP patients , and patients with both autoantibodies have lower platelets. In in vitro studies , we showed that the anti-αvβ3 antibody had no significant effect on the survival and proliferation of MKs , whereas it decreased formations of proplatelet significantly. Anti-αvβ3 antibody impeded stromal cell derived facor-1 alpha ( SDF-1α)- mediated migration and inhibited the phosphorylation of protein kinase B. Anti-αvβ3 antibody significantly inhibited MKs ' adhesion to endothelial cells and Fibrogen. The phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src induced by adhesion was inhibited when MKs were pretreated with anti-αvβ3 antibody. In in vivo studies , we showed that injection with anti-α
