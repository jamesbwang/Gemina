  Mitochondrial diseases present a diagnostic challenge due to their clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Achieving comprehensive molecular diagnosis via a conventional candidate-gene approach is likely , therefore , to be labour- and cost-intensive given the expanding number of mitochondrial disease genes. The advent of whole exome sequencing ( WES) and whole genome sequencing ( WGS) hold the potential of higher diagnostic yields due to the universality and unbiased nature of the methods. However , these approaches are subject to the escalating challenge of variant interpretation. Thus , integration of functional ` multi-omics ' data , such as transcriptomics , is emerging as a powerful complementary tool in the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease patients for whom extensive prior analysis of DNA sequencing has failed to return a genetic diagnosis.
