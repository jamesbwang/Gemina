  Gene expression data analysis is of great importance for modern molecular biology , given our ability to measure the expression profiles of thousands of genes and enabling studies rooted in systems biology. In this work , we propose a simple statistical model for the activation measuring of gene regulatory networks , instead of the traditional gene co-expression networks. We present the mathematical construction of a statistical procedure for testing hypothesis regarding gene regulatory network activation. The real probability distribution for the test statistic is evaluated by a permutation based study. To illustrate the functionality of the proposed methodology , we also present a simple example based on a small hypothetical network and the activation measuring of two KEGG networks , both based on gene expression data collected from gastric and esophageal samples. The two KEGG networks were also analyzed for a public database , available through NCBI-GEO , presented as Supplementary Material. This method was implemented in an R package that is available at the BioConductor project website under the name maigesPack.
