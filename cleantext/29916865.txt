  Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE) is a helpful diagnostic tool when hemodynamic compromise is encountered during noncardiac surgery. At our institution , a Rescue Echo Protocol was created to provide a structured means for requesting and performing a rescue TEE. We analyzed our institutional utilization of this service and found that it was used throughout the spectrum of patients ' American Society of Anesthesiologists classifications and surgical services. We demonstrated that 72.9 % of rescue examinations resulted in a change in management , supporting the use of TEE as a diagnostic tool during hemodynamic compromise.
