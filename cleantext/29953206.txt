  Low-cost transition metal oxides are actively explored as alternative materials to precious metal-based electrocatalysts for the challenging multistep oxygen evolution reaction ( OER). We utilized the Kirkendall effect allowing the formation of hollow polycrystalline , highly disordered nanoparticles ( NPs) to synthesize highly active binary metal oxide OER electrocatalysts in alkali media. Two synthetic strategies were applied to achieve compositional control in binary transition metal oxide hollow NPs. The first strategy is capitalized on the oxidation of transition-metal NP seeds in the presence of other transition-metal cations. Oxidation of Fe NPs treated with Ni ( +2) cations allowed the synthesis of hollow oxide NPs with a 1-4.7 Ni-to-Fe ratio via an oxidation-induced doping mechanism. Hollow Fe-Ni oxide NPs also reached a current density of 10 mA/cm
