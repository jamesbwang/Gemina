  Land surface temperature ( LST) in coarse spatial resolution derived from thermal infrared satellite images has limited use in many remote sensing applications. In this study , we improve our previous approach ( multiple remote-sensing index approach of random forest<disease>) to downscale LST derived from Landsat 8 and MODIS in an arid oasis- desert ecotone of Zhangye city by designing a normalized difference sand index ( NDSI) , by the removal of land cover datasets and by the input of SAVI , NDBI and NDWI to downscale LST. Our result demonstrates that NDSI can determine the characteristic of the desert region , and that the distribution of downscaled LST matches those of oasis-desert ecosystems. Relative to the ground observation of HiWATER , our approach also produces relatively satisfactory downscaling results at July 21 ( 2013) , with R
