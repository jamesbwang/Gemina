  The purpose of this study was to detect the lymphatic drainage pattern of internal mammary area and verify the concept of internal mammary sentinel lymph node ( IM-SLN) in breast. A small particle radiotracer ( 99mTc-Dextran 40) was prepared and tested. 99mTc-Dextran 40 was injected into intraparenchyma at the sound breast by a modified radiotracer injection technique. Subsequently , dynamic single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT) , computed tomography ( CT) , and SPECT/CT combination images were performed to identify the radioactive lymph vessels and internal mammary lymph nodes ( IMLNs). The direction of lymph drainage and the location of the IMLNs were identified in the SPECT/CT imaging. The radiochemical purity of 99mTc-Dextran 40 was > 95 %. 99mTc-Dextran 40 could drainage into first , second , and third lymph node and the radioactive lymph node could be detected by the γ detector in the animal experiment. After 99mTc-Dextran 40 injecting into intraparenchyma , 50.0 % cases ( 15/30) were identified the drainage lymphatic vessels and radioactive IMLNs by SPECT. The drainage lymphatic vessel was found from injection point to the first IMLN ( IM-SLN) after 10.5 ± 0.35 minutes radiotracer injection , and then 99mTc-Dextran 40 was accumulated into the IM-SLN. The combination imaging of SPECT/CT showed the second IMLN received the lymph drainage from the IM-SLN. The lymphatic drainage was step by step in the internal mammary area. The lymph was identified to drain from different regions of the breast to IM-SLN , and then outward from IM-SLN to other IMLN consecutively. It demonstrated the concept of the IM-SLN and provided more evidences for the application of internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy.
