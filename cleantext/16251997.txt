  The present study has focused on the effects of hypericin ( Hyp) based photodynamic inactivation ( PDI) of Escherichia<pathogen> coli ( E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>). To evaluate the efficiency of Hyp based PDI of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , single factor experiments and response surface optimization experiment were conducted to obtain the optimum parameter values ( 36 ÂµM Hyp , 5.9 J cm
