  To observed the effect of sodium hydrosulphide ( NaHS) , a donor of H Rat microglia in logarithmic growth phase was randomly divided into 4 groups. In control group , the cells were cultured without ATP treatment. In ATP group , the cells were treatment with ATP after cultured for 24 hours. In NaHS + ATP group , the cells were incubated with NaHS for 30 min before ATP , and NaHS always existed in the reaction system. In KN-62 + ATP group , the cells were pretreated with KN-62 for 30 min , the others were as the same as NaHS + ATP group. The cell viability was detected by MTT. Fluorescent dyes YO-PRO-1 was used to observe the membrane permeability. The expression of P2X7 receptor was examined by immunofluorescence staining. ① Compared with control group , the cell viability dropped after treatment with ATP ( 1 、 3 、 5 、 10 mmol/L) for 3 hours. When pre-incubation with NaHS ( 200 μmol/L) , the cell viability was apparently higher than that of ATP alone group ( NaHS could reduce the expression of P2X7 receptor , decrease membrane permeability , and increase the cell viability in rat microglia injured by ATP. So the cytoprotection of hydrogen sulfide may be related to the expression and function of P2X7 receptor.
