  Mass production of high-quality graphene dispersions under mild conditions impacts the utility of the material for biomedical applications. Various proteins have been used to prepare graphene dispersions , rare sources , and expensive prices for these proteins restrict their large-scale utility for the production of graphene. Here , inexpensive silk proteins as an abundant resource in nature were used for graphene exfoliation. The silk proteins were assembled into hydrophobic nanofibers with negative charge , and then optimized for the production of graphene. Significantly higher concentrations ( > 8 mg mL
