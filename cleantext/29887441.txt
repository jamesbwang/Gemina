  Understanding the clinical course and time-frame for recovery is helpful to guide management and counselling following a diagnosis of Dilated<symptom> Cardiomyopathy ( DCM). We aimed to document outcomes and time to recovery for a cohort of patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype. An observational cohort methodology was used to collect retrospective data from the departmental database for those identified with DCM. Data relating to mode of presentation , echocardiographic parameters , clinical management and outcome were collated and analysed. Predictors and time-scale for recovery were investigated and reported. 209 new referrals were included within the time frame. 82 children median age 1.0 years ( IQR 3.4) required intensive care ( ICU) and their survival without death or transplant was 51 % to one year and 45 % to five years. 127 children presented to the pediatric heart<symptom> failure<symptom> clinic. Excluding 58 with neuromuscular disease , median age was 4.1 years ( IQR 11.3) & survival without death or transplant 85 % to 1 year and 50 % to 5 years. NT-proBNP normalized in survivors before echocardiographic parameters. Predictors of recovery included younger age , female sex and smaller left ventricular end diastolic Z score on echocardiogram at presentation. Transplant-free survival to one year is significantly better for patients presenting to clinic , but longer-term survival is better amongst those presenting to ICU due to a late attrition in those with less severe heart<symptom> failure<symptom> at presentation. Falling NT-proBNP is the earliest marker of recovery. Recovery of cardiac function remains possible up to three years from presentation.
