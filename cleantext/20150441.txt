  Data variability is a commonly observed phenomenon in Electronic Health Records ( EHR) data networks. A common question asked in scientific investigations of EHR data is whether the cross-site and- time variability reflects an underlying data quality error at one or more contributing sites versus actual differences driven by various idiosyncrasies in the healthcare settings. Although research analysts and data scientists have commonly used various statistical methods to detect and account for variability in analytic datasets , self service tools to facilitate exploring cross-organizational variability in EHR data warehouses are lacking and could benefit from meaningful data visualizations.
