  The histone H3 variant , H3 .3 , is a highly conserved and dynamic regulator of chromatin organization. Therefore , fully elucidating its nucleosome incorporation mechanisms is essential to understanding its functions in epigenetic inheritance. We previously identified the RNase P protein subunit , Rpp29 , as a repressor of H3 .3 chromatin assembly. Here , we use a biochemical assay to show that Rpp29 interacts with H3 .3 through a sequence element in its own N-terminus , and we identify a novel interaction with histone H2B at an adjacent site. Since archaeal Rpp29 does not include this N-terminal region , it suggests that it evolved to regulate eukaryote-specific functions. Oncogenic H3 .3 mutations alter the H3.3-Rpp29 interaction , which suggests that they could dysregulate Rpp29 function in chromatin assembly. We also used KNS42 cells , a H3 .3 ( G34V) pediatric high-grade glioma cell line , to show that Rpp29 1) represses H3 .3 incorporation into transcriptionally active protein-coding , rRNA , and tRNA genes; 2) represses mRNA , protein expression , and antisense RNA; and 3) represses euchromatic post-translational modifications ( PTMs) and promotes heterochromatic PTM deposition ( i.e. H3K9me3 and H3 .1/ 2/3K27me3). Notably , we also found that K27me2 is increased and K36me1 decreased on H3 .3 ( G34V) , which suggests that G34 mutations dysregulate K27 and K36 methylation in cis. Since Rpp29 represses H3 .3 chromatin assembly and sense and antisense RNA and promotes H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 , it suggests that Rpp29 regulates H3.3-mediated epigenetic mechanisms by processing a transcribed signal that recruits H3 .3 to its incorporation sites.
