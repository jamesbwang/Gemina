  Reported here is the isolation of a dianionic cobalt terminal carbyne derived from chemical reduction of an encumbering isocyanide ligand. Crystallographic , spectroscopic and computational data reveal that this carbyne possesses a low-valent cobalt center with an extensively filled d-orbital manifold. This electronic character renders the cobalt center the primary site of nucleophilicity upon reaction with protic substrates and silyl electrophiles. However , reactions with internal alkynes result in ( 2 +2) cycloaddition with the carbyne carbon to form a new C-C bond.
