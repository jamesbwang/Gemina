  It is recommended that all pregnant women in the U.S. receive tetanus<disease> , diphtheria<disease> , acellular pertussis<disease> ( Tdap) immunization to prevent infant pertussis<disease> This study 's objective was to examine the clinical effectiveness of prenatal Tdap , and whether effectiveness varies by gestational age at immunization. A nationwide cohort study of pregnant women with deliveries in 2010-2014 and their infants was performed. Commercial insurance claims data were analyzed in 2016-2017 to identify Tdap receipt by the pregnant women , and hospitalizations and outpatient visits for pertussis<disease> in their infants until the infants reached 18 months of age. Pertussis<disease> occurrence was compared between infants of mothers who received prenatal Tdap ( overall and stratified by gestational age at administration) and infants of unvaccinated mothers. There were 675,167 mother-infant pairs in the cohort. Among infants whose mothers received prenatal Tdap , the rate of pertussis<disease> was 43 % lower ( hazard ratio = 0.57 , 95 % CI = 0.35 , 0.92) than infants whose mothers did not receive prenatal or postpartum Tdap; this reduction was consistent across pertussis<disease> definitions ( hazard ratio for inpatient-only pertussis<disease> = 0.32 , 95 % CI = 0.11 , 0.91). Pertussis<disease> rates were also lower for infants whose mothers received Tdap during the third trimester. Infants whose mothers received Tdap at < 27 weeks of gestation did not experience reductions in pertussis<disease> rates ( hazard ratio for pertussis<disease> = 1.10 , 95 % CI = 0.54 , 2.25). Infants of mothers who received prenatal Tdap experienced half the rate of pertussis<disease> as compared with infants of unimmunized mothers. These results do not provide evidence to support changing the currently recommended timing of Tdap administration in pregnancy.
