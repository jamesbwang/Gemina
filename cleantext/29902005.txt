  Phospholipid composition in the milk fat globule membrane ( MFGM) fluctuates during the entire lactation period in order to suit the growing needs of newborn infants. The present study elucidated and relatively quantified phospholipid molecular species extracted from human milk ( HM) , mature human milk ( MHM) , and infant formulas ( with or without MFGM supplementation) using hydrophilic liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-ion trap-time of flight-mass spectrometry ( HILIC-ESI-IT-TOF-MS) system. Principal component analysis was used to clarify the differences between phospholipid composition in HM , MHM , and infant formulas. HM and MHM contained high concentrations of sphingomyeline ( HM: 107.61 μg/mL , MHM: 227.18 μg/mL) , phosphatidylcholine ( HM: 59.96 μg/mL , MHM: 50.77 μg/mL) , and phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE) ( HM: 25.24 μg/mL , MHM: 31.76 μg/mL). Significant concentrations ( < 300 ng/mL) of arachidonic , eicosapentanoic , and docosahexanoic acids were found to esterify to PE in HM and MHM. Meanwhile , all infant formulas were found to contain high concentrations of phosphatidic acids indicating the possibility of degradation of the fortified MFGM either during processing or storage of the infant formulas.
