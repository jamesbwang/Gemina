  We assessed hematozoa infection in Spectacled Eiders ( Somateria fischeri<pathogen>) at two areas in Alaska. No Haemoproteus or Plasmodium<pathogen> species were detected. Leucocytozoon prevalence was 6.5 % for adults across sites and 41.9 % for juveniles sampled in the Arctic , providing evidence for local transmission. All Leucocytozoon haplotypes were previously detected in waterfowl.
