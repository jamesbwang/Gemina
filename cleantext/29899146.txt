  Diffusiophoresis is the migration of a colloidal particle through a viscous fluid , caused by a gradient in concentration of some molecular solute; a long-range physical interaction between the particle and solute molecules is required. In the case of a charged particle and an ionic solute ( e.g. , table salt , NaCl) , previous studies have predicted and experimentally verified the speed for very low salt concentrations at which the salt solution behaves ideally. The current study presents a study of diffusiophoresis at much higher salt concentrations ( approaching the solubility limit). At such large salt concentrations , electrostatic interactions are almost completely screened , thus eliminating the long-range interaction required for diffusiophoresis; moreover , the high volume fraction occupied by ions makes the solution highly nonideal. Diffusiophoretic speeds were found to be measurable , albeit much smaller than for the same gradient at low salt concentrations.
