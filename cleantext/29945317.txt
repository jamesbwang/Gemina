  Glioma is one of the most common and aggressive malignant tumors of the central nervous system. Here , we review and explore the use of long noncoding RNA ( lncRNA) as a therapeutic strategy for the targeting of gliomas. LncRNA is a functional RNA molecule with no protein coding function and is involved in the occurrence and progression of glioma. It is reported that the activation of several signaling pathways , including the MAPK , p53 , Wnt/Î²-catenin , PI3K/AKT/mTOR , and epithelial mesenchymal transformation ( EMT) pathways , are involved in the regulation of gliomas. In addition , microRNAs in glioma may also interact with lncRNAs and affect tumor growth and progression. Therefore , the exploration of lncRNA participation in signaling pathway regulatory mechanisms and the determination of the interaction between lncRNA and miRNA may help to develop new effective therapies for the treatment of glioma.
