  Several coordination polymers of silver ( i)- pentacyanocyclopentadienide ( PCC) were studied by X-ray diffraction to examine the effects of different solvents on supramolecular isomerism of the PCC-ligand. While alcohols yield supramolecular isomers of ( Ag ( PCC)) without coordination of solvent molecules , less polar solvents show coordinate binding. The influence of solvent polarity can be observed by a gradual change in the lattice structure featuring distinct motifs.
