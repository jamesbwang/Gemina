  Environmental enteropathy ( EE) is characterised by subclinical inflammation<symptom> and hyperpermeability of the small intestine , hypothesised to be caused by recurrent ingestion of faecal bacteria. It has been suggested that EE may be a contributor to malnutrition and growth delays seen in children living in unsanitary conditions. We measured putative faecal EE markers myeloperoxidase ( MPO) ( ng/mL) and alpha-1-antitrypsin ( AAT) ( mg/g) in stool<symptom> samples collected from 133 children aged 1-5 years in 16 communities enrolled in the WASH for WORMS randomised controlled trial in Timor-Leste. Samples were collected two years after a community-wide water , sanitation and hygiene ( WASH) intervention that was integrated with regular deworming. Mixed effects multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the impact of the study intervention and of various WASH and infection-related factors on EE biomarkers. Children who lived in communities that received both the WASH intervention and deworming had similar AAT values as those who lived in communities that received only deworming ( regression coefficient -0.14 , p = 0.583) , but they had a trend towards lower MPO values ( coeff -0.51 , p = 0.055). Younger children showed significantly higher MPO levels ( coeff: -0.29 , p = 0.002). No WASH variables or parasitic infections were associated with AAT levels. Household water being stored in covered containers was associated with lower MPO levels ( coeff -1.75 , p = 0.046). We found little evidence that a community-based WASH intervention had an impact on EE over a two-year period.
