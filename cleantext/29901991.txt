  Anthropogenic chemicals have been proposed as potential markers of human fecal contamination in recreational water. However , to date , there are no published studies describing their relationships with illness risks. Using a cohort of swimmers at seven U.S. beaches , we examined potential associations between the presence of chemical markers of human fecal pollution and self-reported gastrointestinal ( GI) illness , diarrhea<disease> , and respiratory illness. Swimmers were surveyed about their beach activities , water exposure , and baseline symptoms on the day of their beach visit , and about any illness experienced 10-12 days later. Risk differences were estimated using model-based standardization and adjusted for the swimmer 's age , beach site , sand contact , rainfall , and water temperature. Sixty-two chemical markers were analyzed from daily water samples at freshwater and marine beaches. Of those , 20 were found consistently. With the possible exception of bisphenol A and cholesterol , no chemicals were consistently associated with increased risks of illness. These two chemicals were suggestively associated with 2 % and 1 % increased risks of GI illness and diarrhea<disease> in both freshwater and marine beaches. Additional research using the more sensitive analytic methods currently available for a wider suite of analytes is needed to support the use of chemical biomarkers to quantify illness risk and identify fecal pollution sources.
