  Clostridioides<pathogen> ( Clostridium<pathogen>) difficile<pathogen> causes severe diarrheal disease that is directly associated with antibiotic use and resistance. Although C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> demonstrates intrinsic resistance to many antimicrobials , few genetic mechanisms of resistance have been characterized in this pathogen. In this study , we investigated the putative resistance factor , CD1240 ( VanZ1) , an ortholog of the teicoplanin resistance factor , VanZ , of Enterococcus<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> In C.<pathogen> difficile<pathogen> , the vanZ1 gene is located within the skin element of the sporulation factor Ïƒ
