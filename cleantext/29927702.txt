  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) causes more than 50,000 deaths each year in the United States but early detection through screening yields survival gains; those diagnosed with early stage disease have a 5-year survival greater than 90 % , compared to 12 % for those diagnosed with late stage disease. Using data from a large integrated health system , this study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of fecal immunochemical testing ( FIT) , a common CRC screening tool. A probabilistic decision-analytic model was used to examine the costs and outcomes of positive test results from a 1-FIT regimen compared with a 2-FIT regimen. The authors compared 5 diagnostic cutoffs of hemoglobin concentration for each test ( for a total of 10 screening options). The principal outcome from the analysis was the cost per additional advanced neoplasia ( AN) detected. The authors also estimated the number of cancers detected and life-years gained from detecting AN. The following costs were included: program management of the screening program , patient identification , FIT kits and their processing , and diagnostic colonoscopy following a positive FIT. Per-person costs ranged from $ 33 ( 1-FIT at 150ng/ml) to $ 92 ( 2-FIT at 50ng/ml) across screening options. Depending on willingness to pay , the 1-FIT 50 ng/ml and the 2-FIT 50 ng/ml are the dominant strategies with cost-effectiveness of $ 11,198 and $ 28,389 , respectively , for an additional AN detected. The estimates of cancers avoided per 1000 screens ranged from 1.46 to 4.86 , depending on the strategy and the assumptions of AN to cancer progression.
