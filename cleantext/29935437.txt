  Agents with multiple modes of tumor cell death can be effective chemotherapeutic drugs. One example of a bimodal chemotherapeutic approach is an agent that can induce both apoptosis and autophagic death. Thus far , no clinical anticancer drug has been shown to simultaneously induce both these pathways. Mono-functional platinum complexes are potent anticancer drug candidates which act through mechanisms distinct from cisplatin. Here , we describe the synthesis and characterize of two mono-functional platinum complexes containing 8-substituted quinoline derivatives as ligands , ( PtL
