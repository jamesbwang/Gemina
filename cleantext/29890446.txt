  The modified creatinine ( Cr) index , calculated by age , sex , pre-dialysis serum Cr levels , and Kt/V for urea , reflects skeletal muscle mass in patients on hemodialysis. Whether the modified Cr index is associated with cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality remains unknown. A total of 3027 patients registered in the Q-Cohort Study , a multicenter , prospective study of patients on hemodialysis in Japan , were analyzed. The main outcomes were cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Associations between sex-specific quartiles of the modified Cr index and outcomes were analyzed by the Cox proportional hazard models and the Fine-Gray proportional subdistribution hazards model. The modified Cr index was correlated with known nutritional and inflammatory markers. During a 4-year follow-up , 499 patients died of any cause , 372 experienced heart disease , and 194 developed stroke. The risk for all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the lower quartiles ( Q1 and Q2) than in the highest quartile ( Q4) as the reference group ( hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals: Q1 , 2.65 ( 1.69-4.25) , Q2 , 1.92 ( 1.27-2.94) , and Q3 , 1.31 ( 0.87-2.02)). The risk of heart disease was significantly higher in Q1 than in Q4 ( hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals: Q1 , 1.64 ( 1.04-2.61) , Q2 , 1.34 ( 0.91-2.00) , and Q3 , 1.04 ( 0.71-1.52)). The risk of stroke was not associated with the modified Cr index. A lower modified Cr index is associated with an increased risk for heart disease and all-cause mortality , but not with the risk for stroke in patients on hemodialysis.
