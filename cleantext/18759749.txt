  The loss of endogenous cardiac regenerative capacity within the first week of postnatal life has intensified clinical trials to induce cardiac regeneration in the adult mammalian heart using different progenitor cell types. We hypothesized that donor age-related phenotypic and functional characteristics of cardiac progenitor cells ( CPC) account for mixed results of cell-based cardiac repair. We compared expression profiles and cell turnover rates of human heart-derived c-kit
