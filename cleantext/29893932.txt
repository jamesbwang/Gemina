  Transitional care for patients with IBD focuses on efforts to successfully transfer care from pediatric to adult providers while encouraging the assumption of health care responsibility. As 25 % of patients will be diagnosed with IBD before the age of 18 years , many will undergo this process. Efforts to enhance this process have included transition clinics and other means to improve patient comfort with transition and develop the skill of health care self-management. Currently , most pediatric practitioners provide transition care with informal education and emphasize independence without formal programs. A variety of tools to assess transition readiness have been developed. Given the varied disease process , often varied and subjective outcomes , and lack of studies such as randomized controlled trials , further data are necessary to determine the best avenue to transition and assess outcomes. Critically relevant to providing adequate care to transitioning patients includes understanding the development of self-management skills and the developmental processes relevant to young adults with IBD. Transition represents an area for quality improvement , and although progress has been made in recognition and promotion of transition practices , future directions in research will allow improved understanding of the evidence-based practices and needs of these individuals to further enhance their care.
