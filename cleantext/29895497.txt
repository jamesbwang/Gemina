  β-N-oxalyl-L-α , β-diaminopropionic acid ( L-ODAP) is a non-protein amino acid with haemostatic property present in Lathyrus sativus. It is considered to be the causative agent of neurolathyrism that occurs upon prolonged overconsumption of Lathyrus sativus seeds. L-ODAP is used as a haemostatic drug in surgical dressings. We previously reported that it can stabilize hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF) -1 α in normoxic conditions. We hypothesised that L-ODAP might affect wound<disease> healing by modulating cellular proliferation , migration and angiogenesis via HIF-1α stabilization. We performed in vitro assays to evaluate wound<disease> healing activity of L-ODAP. Further , we prepared pharmaceutical gel containing L-ODAP and checked its effect on healing of full thickness excision wounds<disease> using Wistar albino rats. Effect of L-ODAP on HT1080 cell line proliferation , migration and invasion was investigated. Further , gel containing L-ODAP was applied on full thickness excision wounds<disease> of Wistar rats. Western blot and zymography were performed with wound<disease> tissue extracts obtained 2 days post-wounding and histological and immunohistochemical analysis with regenerated tissue obtained 10 days post-wounding. Evaluation was made based on wound<disease> contraction percentage , histological analysis and protein expression levels. L-ODAP significantly ( P < 0.05) affected wound<disease> healing both in vitro and in vivo. At non-toxic concentrations , it induced cell proliferation , migration , invasion and MMP-2 & -9 expressions. L-ODAP treated wounds<disease> healed faster than vehicle treated ones. Significantly higher expression level of HIF-1α , VEGF-A , PDGF-A and matrix metalloproteases were observed in L-ODAP treated wounds<disease> The present investigation explores potential of L-ODAP as a wound<disease> healing agent. L-ODAP positively affected wound<disease> healing both in vitro and in vivo and thus could be considered a natural wound<disease> healing agent.
