  Background/aim: Declined morbidity rates after craniosynostosis surgery indicate bypassing the pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU) course to minimize treatment costs and bed usage. The aim of this study is to examine the incident rates of PICU admission and assess its necessity. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of 41 patients ( operated on by open surgical techniques) between July 2011 and December 2015 was carried out. Intraoperative/postoperative vital signs , hemodynamic and metabolic parameters , estimated blood<symptom> loss<symptom> ( EBVloss) , blood transfusions , length of PICU , and hospitalizations were recorded. Results: Major and minor events reached 51.2 % and 82.9 % , respectively. EBVloss within 24 h was calculated as 39.58 Â± 8.19 ( median: 38.44 , 25.68-66.34) with 75.6 % blood transfusion rate. Hypotension<symptom> and hypothermia<symptom> were associated with prolonged surgery ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.007 , respectively) , but were not related to age ( P = 0.054 , P = 0.162) or procedure types ( P = 0.558 , P = 0.663). Prolonged surgery and younger age had an impact on the complications. One patient died of persistent hemorrhage<symptom> at 96 h. Conclusion: Monitoring cardiovascular and metabolic dynamics at PICU during the first 24 h after surgery is crucial. Additional studies are needed to define the threshold values of several metabolic and hemodynamic markers in risk assessment after cranial vault surgery.
