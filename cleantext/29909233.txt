  The mechanisms of allergen immunotherapy are not fully elucidated. Here , we sought to develop a murine model to demonstrate the effectiveness of subcutaneous immunotherapy ( SCIT) for allergic responses. As excessive antigen dosages may induce immune tolerance in sensitized mice , the effects of SCIT were assessed by varying the antigen dosage. The mechanisms of SCIT were analyzed by focusing on the induction of Foxp3 Ovalbumin ( OVA) + Al ( OH) The maximum effects of SCIT were observed with 1 mg/animal of OVA for airway inflammation<symptom> induced by 5 Î¼g/animal of OVA , in which airway eosinophilia and Th2 cytokine production were markedly suppressed. The increase in the OVA-specific IgE level was significantly suppressed by SCIT. The development of bronchial epithelial thickening and mucus accumulation were also suppressed by SCIT. Concomitantly , IL-10-producing Foxp3 We successfully developed an airway allergic model for SCIT. It was suggested that most of IL-10-producing Foxp3
