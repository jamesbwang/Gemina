  Climate change can impair ecosystem functions and services in extensive dry forests worldwide. However , attribution of climate change impacts on tree growth and forest<disease> productivity is challenging due to multiple inter-annual patterns of climatic variability associated with atmospheric and oceanic circulations. Moreover , growth responses to rising atmospheric CO
