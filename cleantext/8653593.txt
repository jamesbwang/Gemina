  The physicochemical composition and the technological and sensory properties of hamburgers made with meat from Ile de France lambs fed on different levels ( 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 and 40 %) of whole cottonseed were studied. The addition of whole cottonseed to the lambs ' diets decreased the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in the lamb meat and altered the physicochemical characteristics of the hamburgers , which were characterised by low lipid (
