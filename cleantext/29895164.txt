  The aim of this study was to investigate biological and molecular properties of two Ukrainian tomato isolates of potato virus M ( PVM) , K-16 and Pol-14 , to determine their phylogenetic relationships and the genetic variability of PVM isolates. Study of phylogenetic relationships of two Ukrainian tomato PVM isolates with 35 isolates represented in GenBank was conducted. It was found that the coat protein ( CP) gene sequence identity between two Ukrainian PVM isolates is 94.3 % at the nucleotide level and 100 % at the amino acid level. The highest level of the sequence identity ( 97.0 % and 96.5 % nt and 100 % aa) have the isolates K-16 and Pol-14 with the German potato isolate DSMZ PV0273 , Indian potato isolates Del 123 , Del 134 , Del 147 , M 34 and Chinese isolate from pepino GS-6-2 ( isolate K-16) , which testifies about their common origin. Ukrainian tomato isolates K-16 and Pol-14 belong together with all European , Chinese , Iranian , Indian isolates to PVM-o clade or group I. It was found that the nucleotide substitutions in the capsid protein gene of all tomato PVM isolates ( except the Italian) are synonymous. Analysis showed that the global dN/dS ratio for the entire CP gene sequences used in the study was 0.041 ( p Keywords: potato virus M; Solanum lycopersicum; phylogenetic analysis; genetic variability; selection pressure.
