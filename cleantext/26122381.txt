  Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain cancer in adults with an incidence of 3.4 per 100,000 , making up about 15 % of all brain tumors. Inconsistent results have been published in regard differences in survival between white and black glioblastoma patients. The objective of this to study the association between race and in Glioblastoma patients in the USA during 2010-2014. The National Cancer Institute 's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results ( SEER) database were used to evaluate race/ethnicity ( White non-Hispanic , Black non-Hispanic , Asian/Pacific Islanders non-Hispanic ( API)) and Hispanic) adults patients with first-time diagnosis of glioblastoma ( International Classification of Diseases for Oncology , 3rd Edition ( ICD-O-3) , codes C711-C714 , and histology type 9440/3) from 2010-2014. The primary outcome was 3-year overall survival which was defined as months from diagnosis to death due to any cause and cancer , Kaplan-Meier ( KM) and log-rank test were used to compare overall survival times across race groups. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the independent effect of race on 3-year survival. Age , gender , health insurance coverage , primary site , tumor size , extent of surgery and year of diagnosis were included in the adjusted model. The 3-year overall survival for API-non Hispanic ( NH) patients decreased by 25 % compared with White NH glioblastoma patients ( hazard ratio ( HR) 0.75; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.62-0.90)) after adjusting for age , gender , health insurance , primary site , tumor size , and extent of the surgery. Black NH ( HR 0.95; 95 % CI 0.80-1.13) and Hispanic ( HR 1.01 , 95 % CI 0.84-1.21) exhibited similar mortality risks compared with White NH patients. Compared with White NH , API NH with glioblastoma have a better survival. The findings from this study can help increase the accuracy of the prognostic outlook for white , black and API patients with GBM.
