  Adult<disease> and embryonic stem cells exhibit fluctuating gene expression; however , the biological significance of stem cell heterogeneity is not well understood. We show that , in Drosophila , female germline stem cells ( GSCs) exhibit heterogeneous expression of a GSC differentiation-promoting factor Regena ( Rga). The Drosophila homolog of human SON , dsn , is required to maintain GSC heterogeneity by suppressing sustained high levels of Rga. Reducing the expression of Rga in dsn mutants restores GSC heterogeneity and self-renewal. Thus , GSC heterogeneity is linked to GSC homeostasis.
