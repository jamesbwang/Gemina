  Anode design is highly significant for microbial fuel cells , since it simultaneously serves as the scaffold for electroactive microorganisms and as a medium for electron migration. In this study , a stiff 3D carbon foam with surface anchored nitrogen-containing carbon nanoparticles was facilely constructed via in-situ polyaniline coating of carbonized steamed cake prior to the carbonization process. The resultant product was determined to be an excellent freestanding anode that enabled the microbial fuel cell to deliver a maximum power density of up to 1307 mW/m
