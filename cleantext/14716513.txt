  Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma ( MANEC) is a tumor of the gastrointestinal tract that contains both exocrine and endocrine components , with each component exceeding 30 % of the total tumor area. Because MANECs are exceedingly rare , no therapeutic strategies have been established yet. An 81-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a 5-month history of dysphagia<symptom>. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed an ulcerated mass in the lower thoracic esophagus , extending up to the esophagogastric junction ( 33 to 40 cm from the incisors). The initial biopsy diagnosis was adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography revealed no evidence of lymph node or distant metastasis. The patient was treated by thoracoscopic esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection and gastric tube reconstruction via a posterior mediastinal approach , under the diagnosis of esophagogastric junctional cancer ( T3N0M0 , stage IIA). Histopathological examination revealed two distinct components , namely , a neuroendocrine carcinoma component and an adenocarcinoma component , and the patient was diagnosed as having mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma ( MANEC). He presented with liver metastasis 6 months after the surgery. Thereafter , the tumor became even more aggressive , and the patient died 8 months after the surgery. We report a patient with MANEC of the esophagogastric junction. Close attention should be paid to such patients , as MANEC can be a highly aggressive tumor , showing rapid progression. In the treatment of MANEC , it is necessary to carefully consider the pathological features in each individual case.
