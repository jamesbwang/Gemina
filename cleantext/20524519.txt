  Medial collateral ligament ( MCL) injuries are the most common knee ligament injuries. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) is the investigation of choice for detecting such injuries. We report two cases of acute grade 3 MCL tears in young adults in which the injury was suspected clinically and was later confirmed by surgical exploration. However , the MRI failed to pick up the exact nature of injury. This report signifies the importance of an appropriate clinical examination for MCL injuries and stresses that decision-making for treatment should be based on the clinical examination rather than the MRI.
