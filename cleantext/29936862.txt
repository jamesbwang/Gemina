  A multidisciplinary team of nurses , sterile processing technicians , and surgeons reviewed 609 otolaryngology-head and neck surgery ( OHNS) surgical instrument sets at the study institution 's 3 hospitals. Implementation of the 4-phase instrument review resulted in decreased OHNS surgical instrument set types from 261 to 234 sets , and a decreased number of instruments in these sets from 18 952 to 17 084. The instrument set review resulted in an estimated savings of $ 35 665 in sterile processing costs for the OHNS department. Instrument review applied to all 10 surgical specialties at the institution would result in an estimated annual savings of $ 425 378. Through effective leadership , multidisciplinary participation of all key stakeholders , and a systematic approach , this study demonstrates that a hospital-wide quality improvement intervention for instrument set optimization can be successfully performed in a large , multisite tertiary care academic hospital.
