  Molecular identification of neuronal types and genetic and imaging approaches to characterize their properties reveal morphological , physiological and dynamic aspects of sensory circuit development. Here we focus on the mouse tactile sensory circuitry , with particular emphasis on the main trigeminal pathway that connects the whiskers , the major tactile organ in rodents , to the neocortex. At each level of this pathway , neurogenesis , axonal elongation , pathfinding , target recognition and circuit reorganization including dendritic refinement of cortical layer 4 neurons occur contemporaneously and a multitude of molecular signals are used in differing combinations. We highlight recent advances in development of tactile circuitry and note gaps in our understanding.
