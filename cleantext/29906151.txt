  We show in a simple exactly solvable toy model that a properly designed impulse perturbation can transiently cool down low-energy degrees of freedom at the expense of high-energy ones that heat up. The model consists of two infinite-range quantum Ising models: one , the high-energy sector , with a transverse field much bigger than the other , the low-energy sector. The finite-duration perturbation is a spin exchange that couples the two Ising models with an oscillating coupling strength. We find a cooling of the low-energy sector that is optimized by the oscillation frequency in resonance with the spin exchange excitation. After the perturbation is turned off , the Ising model with a low transverse field can even develop a spontaneous symmetry breaking despite being initially above the critical temperature.
