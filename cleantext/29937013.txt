  With the advent of minimally invasive techniques , laparoscopic Ladd 's procedure is increasingly used to treat children with malrotation , yet evidence regarding its safety and efficacy is lacking. We hypothesize that operative and postoperative outcomes with the open technique are superior to the laparoscopic Ladd 's procedure. We conducted a 5-y retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent Ladd 's procedure at our institution from 2010-2015. Exclusion of patients included those with concomitant conditions , such as poor gut perfusion , significant reflux , tracheoesophageal fistula<disease> , failure to thrive requiring concomitant gastrostomy , and biliary atresia. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were used where appropriate. Between 2010 and 2015 , of 130 patients who underwent Ladd 's procedure , 77 met inclusion criteria. Sixty-two patients underwent initial open surgery , 15 patients underwent laparoscopy , seven of which were converted to open. Patients undergoing open surgery were younger compared to the laparoscopic groups. Thirty-three of the 77 malrotation patients ( 43 %) presented with volvulus , 27 underwent open surgery , four had laparoscopic converted to open procedures , and two patients underwent laparoscopic Ladd 's without incident. Laparoscopy resulted in increased operative time and clinic visits. Patients undergoing laparoscopic to open surgery had longer operative times , time to resume diet , and length of hospital stay. No difference was noted in complications among the groups. Although minimally invasive approaches are becoming increasingly used , no evidence supports laparoscopic superiority over open Ladd 's procedure. We found that open surgery was associated with shorter operating times and fewer clinic visits. Furthermore , laparotomy remains the favored procedure for patients presenting with volvulus.
