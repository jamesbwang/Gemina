  Body composition alterations , or lipodystrophy , can lead to serious health problems in people living with HIV/AIDS ( PLWHA). The objectives of this study are to predict and validate sex-specific anthropometric predictive models for the diagnosis of lipodystrophy in PLWHA. A cross-sectional design was employed to recruit 106 PLWHA ( men = 65 and women = 41) in Brazil during 2013-2014. They were evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry , and 19 regions of body perimeters and 6 skinfold thicknesses were taken. Sex-specific predictive models for lipodystrophy diagnosis were developed through stepwise linear regression analysis. Cross-validations using predicted residual error sum of squares was performed to validate each predictive model. Results support the use of anthropometry for the diagnosis of lipodystrophy in men and women living with HIV/AIDS. A high power of determination with a small degree of error was observed for lipodystrophy diagnosis for men in model six ( r The proposed anthropometric models advance the field of public health by facilitating early diagnosis and better management of lipodystrophy , a serious adverse health effect experienced by PLWHA.
