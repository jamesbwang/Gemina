  Congenital cytomegalovirus ( cCMV) infections are the leading nongenetic cause of congenital sensorineural hearing loss ( SNHL); however the true impact of cCMV infections remains unknown. ( 1) To identify the number of asymptomatic and symptomatic cCMV infections diagnosed between 1999 and 2014 at the Lausanne University Hospital; ( 2) to describe the audiological and neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants with cCMV infection; and ( 3) to compare clinical outcomes between infants born to mothers with primary versus nonprimary infection. This was a single-centre , observational , exploratory , retrospective study of newborns diagnosed with cCMV infection at the Lausanne University Hospital between 1999 and 2014. Fifty newborns with cCMV infection were identified; 39 ( 78 %) were symptomatic at birth , of whom 29 ( 74 %) were neurologically symptomatic. Twelve children ( 24 %) presented with subsequent abnormal audiological and/or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Newborns born to mothers with a nonprimary infection were more often symptomatic at birth than those born to mothers with a primary infection. All infants with subsequent SNHL or abnormal neurodevelopment were symptomatic at birth. Similar long-term neurodevelopmental and audiological outcomes were observed in infants born to mothers with a primary and nonprimary infection.
