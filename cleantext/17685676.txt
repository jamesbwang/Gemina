  The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationships between bat swing speed ( BSS) , muscle thickness , and muscle thickness asymmetry in collegiate baseball players. Twenty-four collegiate baseball players participated in this study. Maximum BSS in hitting a teed ball was measured using a motion capture system. The muscle thicknesses of the trunk ( upper abdominal rectus<pathogen> , central abdominal rectus<pathogen> , lower abdominal rectus<pathogen> , abdominal wall , and multifidus lumborum) , upper limb , and lower limb were measured using a B-mode ultrasonography. Lateral asymmetry between each pair of muscles was determined as the ratio of the thickness of the dominant side to that of the non-dominant side. Statistically significant positive correlations were observed between BSS and muscle thicknesses of the abdominal wall and multifidus lumborum on the dominant side (
