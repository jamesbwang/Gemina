  In response to microbial infection , the human host deploys metal-sequestering host-defense proteins , which reduce nutrient availability and thereby inhibit microbial growth and virulence. Calprotectin ( CP) is an abundant antimicrobial protein released from neutrophils and epithelial cells at sites of infection. CP sequesters divalent first-row transition metal ions to limit the availability of essential metal nutrients in the extracellular space. While functional and clinical studies of CP have been pursued for decades , advances in our understanding of its biological coordination chemistry , which is central to its role in the host-microbe interaction , have been made in more recent years. In this review , we focus on the coordination chemistry of CP and highlight studies of its metal-binding properties and contributions to the metal-withholding innate immune response. Taken together , these recent studies inform our current model of how CP participates in metal homeostasis and immunity , and they provide a foundation for further investigations of a remarkable metal-chelating protein at the host-microbe interface and beyond.
