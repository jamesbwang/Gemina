  In this study , male F344 rats were orally exposed to aflatoxin B1 ( AFB1) at 0 , 5 , 25 , and 75 μg/kg for 4 weeks. Rat feces were collected from 2 to 4 weeks following exposure and were assessed for gut-microbiota-dependent metabolites. Gut-microbiota-related organic acids were quantitated in the feces using 2-nitrophenylhydrazine derivatization coupled HPLC-profiling method which was validated and showed good reliability , accuracy and sensitivity. After 2-week exposure , AFB1 significantly reduced the levels of fecal short-chain fatty acids ( SCFAs) with an over 70 % reduction in the high-dose group ( 75 μg/kg). Mixed-effects model revealed an inverse correlation between AFB1 dose and fecal levels of SCFAs , but no significant time effect was found. When compared with the control , oral exposure to middle-dose AFB1 ( 25 μg/kg) resulted in remarkable elevations of fecal cholic acid ( 2.18-fold) , linoleic acid ( cis-9 , cis-12-18:2) ( 11.3-fold) , pentadecanoic acid ( 15: 0) ( 3.68-fold) , pyruvic acid ( 4.56-fold) , and 3-phenyllactic acid ( 3.74-fold) , but deoxycholic acid level was reduced by 41 % in the low-dose group ( 5 μg/kg). These results demonstrated the disruptions of several important gut-microbiota metabolic pathways , including the synthesis of SCFAs , pyruvic acid related pathways , metabolisms of amino acids , bile acids and long-chain fatty acids , which may further affect host digestive efficiency , energy supply , intestinal immunity , production of neurotransmitters , and enterohepatic cross-talk. Our study suggests that the impairment of gut-microbiota-dependent metabolism may contribute to pathological mechanisms of AFB1-induced adverse health effects.
