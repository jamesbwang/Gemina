  The evolutionary history of the Crustacea<pathogen> reveals ample adaptive radiation and the subsequent occupation of many osmotic niches resulting from physiological plasticity in their osmoregulatory mechanisms. We evaluate osmoregulatory ability in the intertidal , thinstripe hermit crab Clibanarius symmetricus after short-term exposure ( 6 h) or long-term acclimation ( 10 days) to a wide salinity range , also analyzing kinetic behavior and Î±-subunit mRNA expression of the gill ( Na
