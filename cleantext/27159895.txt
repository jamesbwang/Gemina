  Recently , the wide application of CuO nanoparticles ( NPs) in engineering field inevitably leads to its release into various geologic settings , which has aroused great concern about the geochemical behaviors of CuO NPs due to its high surface reactivity and impact on the fate of co-existing contaminants. However , the redox transformation of pollutants mediated by CuO NPs and the underlying mechanism still remain poorly understood. Here , we studied the interaction of CuO NPs with As ( III) , and explored the reaction pathways using batch experiments and multiple spectroscopic techniques. The results of in situ quick scanning X-ray absorption spectroscopy ( Q-XAS) analysis verified that CuO NPs is capable of catalytically oxidize As ( III) under dark conditions efficiently at a wide range of pHs. As ( III) was firstly adsorbed on CuO NPs surface and then gradually oxidized to As ( V) with dissolved O
