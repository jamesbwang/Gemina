  Curcumin ( from turmeric) , has been extensively investigated for potential beneficial properties in numerous diseases. Most work has focused on supra-dietary concentrations/doses that would necessitate curcumin supplementation. However , much evidence instigating curcumin research is underpinned by epidemiological data based on low dietary intake via turmeric consumption. Here , a novel , highly sensitive liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry ( LC-ESI-MS/MS) method for detection of curcuminoids is described. Assay sensitivity is demonstrated in a pilot pharmacokinetic volunteer study following ingestion of foodstuffs containing a standardized mass of turmeric , representative of daily consumption by certain South Asian populations. Free parent curcumin was detectable in plasma from one individual , reaching maximal plasma concentrations ( C Despite poor absorption and rapid conjugation , dietary intake of standard culinary turmeric within complex food matrices furnished human plasma with detectable levels of curcuminoids. Whether sustained low systemic concentrations of these non-nutritive , biologically active , dietary components may have pharmacological activity for human health benefit , warrants further research.
