  Oxicams ( e.g. piroxicam , meloxicam) are widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs). A large body of evidence from epidemiological and preclinical studies has shown that NSAIDs have a chemopreventive effect on different types of cancer , especially in colorectal cancer. Moreover , mounting evidence from preclinical and clinical studies suggests that persistent inflammation<symptom> functions as a driving force in the journey to cancer. What is more , inflammation<symptom> induces reactive oxygen and nitrogen species , which cause damage to important cellular components ( e.g. , DNA , proteins and lipids) , which can directly or indirectly contribute to malignant cell transformation. In this study , we discuss the synthesis and the resultant newly synthesized oxicam derivatives which are potentially chemopreventive , and at the same time antioxidant. Compound 9c , with the highest therapeutic index in the LoVo cancer cell line , was found to be the most efficient in ROS scavenging activity under conditions of oxidative stress.
