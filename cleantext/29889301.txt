  There is ongoing debate regarding the degree to which , and the conditions under which , physiological , affect-related ( i.e. , embodied) processes contribute to emotion information processing. Whereas most studies focus on clearly visible and intentional processing conditions , the present study targeted this issue by studying the implicit processing of emotional ( angry , fearful , joyful , neutral) faces in a masked emotion misattribution procedure. That is , participants had to categorize neutral-looking faces with regard to the allegedly felt emotion , which were preceded by a very briefly presented emotional expression. In addition to behavioral measures , facial<symptom> muscle<symptom> responses<symptom> were obtained as an index of physiological , affect-related processes. Linear mixed-model mediation analyses confirmed that facial<symptom> muscle<symptom> responses<symptom> partially mediated the behavioral responses to the masked primes in the misattribution task.
