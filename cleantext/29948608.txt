  The increasing demand for cocoa and search for ingredients rich in bioactive compounds encouraged us to investigate the possibility of replacing it by carob powder in the muffins containing soy beans , sesame oil and flaxseeds. There was 5 % addition of carob or cocoa powder to the individual doughs. The muffins with the addition of carob were characterized by improved antiradical activity ( by 36 %- 2,2 '- azino-bis ( 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) ( ABTS) method , by 83 %- 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ( DPPH) method) , higher content of genistein ( 18 %) and total phytosterols ( 17 %) in the dry mass. The color differences in the carob muffins crusts were not perceptible by consumers ( ΔE = 0.70 for crust , ΔE = 5.6 for crumb) and their taste was found to be less bitter and sweeter than the taste of cocoa muffins. Moreover , the addition of carob powder as well as cocoa powder resulted in good sensory quality. The high content of phytosterols , genistein and improved antiradical properties proved carob to be a source of bioactive compounds. The results show that carob powder may be used as valuable alternative muffin ingredient to cocoa.
