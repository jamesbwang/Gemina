  Elevated blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> is still one of the major risk factors for diseases and disabilities and also a public health challenge worldwide. In the present longitudinal study , we aimed to evaluate the association between risk of hypertension and dietary advanced glycation end products ( AGEs) as a recently discussed potential risk factor. Dietary assessment of 1775 participants in the third phase of Tehran lipid and glucose study to obtain dietary intake of AGEs was performed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire , and they were followed up for a mean duration of approximately 6 years. To determine the incidence of hypertension across quartiles of AGEs intake , logistic regression models with adjustment for potential confounding variables were used. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS , and Higher hypertension occurrence risk was generally attributed to higher AGEs intake quartiles after adjusting for age in men ( odds ratio ( OR) = 1.48 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.11-1.52 , In conclusion , it is highly recommended to limit dietary AGEs consumption to prevent and manage hypertension and its complications.
