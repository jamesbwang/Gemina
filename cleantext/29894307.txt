  There is substantial evidence regarding enhanced antitumor cytotoxicity of selected chemotherapeutic agents by appropriate heat exposure ( 40-44 °C). Based upon these results , the integration of hyperthermia<symptom> as an additional treatment modality given simultaneously with systemic chemotherapy is currently of considerable interest. Hyperthermia<symptom> can be induced by alternating magnetic field and magnetic nanoparticles. Thus , we have used thermosensitive magnetoliposomes that contained superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and doxorubicin for in vitro and in vivo therapy of rat glioma C6. The results showed that magnetoliposomes can be specifically heated to 43 °C ( phase transition temperature of a used lipid composition) in a few minutes , and during this , the encapsulated doxorubicin is released in a controllable manner. The in vitro experiments showed that the cell viability decreased to 79.2 % after heat treatment alone and to 47.4 % for doxorubicin-loaded magnetoliposomes without application of alternating magnetic field , while the combined treatment resulted in 17.3 % cell viability. Also , in vivo results demonstrated that magnetic drug targeting has a strong antiglioma effect with a tumor volume growth inhibition and complete regression. Such targeted delivery and controlled release of anticancer agents would provide clinical advantages compared with currently available methods.
