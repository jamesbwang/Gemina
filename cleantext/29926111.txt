  To study the prevalence of hepatitis<pathogen> C<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HCV<pathogen>)- infection in blood donor ( BD) , haemodialysis ( HD) and intravenous drug user ( IVDU) populations in Singapore and assess the IL28B polymorphism if HCV<pathogen> positive. The BD population were healthy volunteers , the HD population were patients who were on haemodialysis for at least 6 months of follow-up between Jan 2009 and Dec2014. IVDU population was from inmates at half-way houses who consented. Between 2011 and 2014 , of 161,658 individuals screened for blood donation , 42 ( 0.059 %) were positive for HCV<pathogen>. Common genotype ( GT) were GT-3 ( 47.6 %) and GT-1 ( 31 %). Of 1,575 HD patients 2.2 % were anti-HCV positive. The HCV<pathogen> GT distribution was GT-1 ( 32.3 %) , GT-3 ( 20.5 %) and GT-6 ( 8.8 %). 83 halfway house inmates were screened. Of the 47 IVDU , 36.2 % were anti-HCV positive with predominant GT-3 ( %). IL28B polymorphism was noted to be CC predominantly 85.3 %. Prevalence of HCV<pathogen> infection has decreased in both the BD and HD population. However it remains high in IVDU population. GT-1 remains the most common in the HD population; however , GT-3 infection is now more common among the BD population in Singapore. IL28B- CC is the predominant variant among the HCV<pathogen>- infected individuals in Singapore.
