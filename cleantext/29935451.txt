  Given that out-of-pocket ( OOP) costs impact adherence to treatment and recent and proposed changes to the health insurance system that impact OOP costs , it is imperative to understand the OOP cost burden faced by individuals with anxiety<symptom> disorders depending upon type of insurance coverage. The objective of this study was to determine the annual OOP cost burden faced by individuals with anxiety<symptom> disorders and the variation of these costs by type of insurance coverage. Using weighted nationally representative data from the 2011-2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys , total OOP health care costs were assessed for all respondents who indicated that they had an anxiety<symptom> disorder ( N = 9985). Total OOP health care costs were also calculated separately by type of insurance. Average annual OOP costs among individuals with anxiety<symptom> was $ 1152. The highest OOP cost were incurred by individuals with private fee-for-service ( FFS) insurance ( $ 1356/year , 4.1 % of annual income) , while individuals enrolled in HMOs with dual Medicare/Medicaid had the lowest OOP cost ( $ 129/year , 6.8 % of annual income). Individuals without insurance had high OOP cost burden ( $ 1309/year , 12.5 % of annual income). Individuals with anxiety<symptom> disorders have a wide range of OOP cost depending upon their insurance coverage. Those with anxiety<symptom> should carefully consider their choice of insurance coverage if interested in minimizing OOP costs.
