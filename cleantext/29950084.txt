  Allicin is one of the main bioactive substances in garlic , with antibacterial , hypolipidemic and other pharmacological effects. In this study , apoptosis-related indicators were detected to explore the molecular mechanism of allicin on KG-1 cell proliferation inhibition. The apoptosis rate of KG-1 cells induced by allicin was detected by flow cytometry. The effect of allicin on the expressions of Bax , Bcl-2 , survivin and ERK mRNA in KG-1 cells was detected by RT-qPCR. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of caspase 3 , cleaved caspase 3 , ERK1/2 , p-ERK1/ 2 and survivin protein in KG-1 cells. According to the findings , compared with the control group , allicin could significantly inhibit the proliferation activity of KG-1 cells in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry showed that allicin could induce the apoptosis of KG-1 cells , which was mainly late apoptosis. The results of RT-qPCR showed that the expressions of Bax mRNA , Bcl-2 , survivin and ERK mRNA in KG-1 cells increased after treatment with allicin. The results of Western-blot showed that after KG-1 cells were treated with allicin , the expressions of caspase 3 and its active form cleaved caspase 3 increased , the expressions of survivin , ERK1/2 and its active form p-ERK1/ 2 were decreased , of which p-ERK1/ 2 was down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner. The above results suggest that allicin inhibited the proliferation of KG-1 cells primarily by inducing late apoptosis; the execution of apoptosis involved cleaved caspase 3; the induction of apoptosis involved the protein expression , the decrease of ERK1/2andexpression of survivin and the dose-dependent decrease of p-ERK1/ 2; the mRNA expression involved the increase of Bax , and the down-regulation of survivin , Bcl-2 and ERK1/2.
