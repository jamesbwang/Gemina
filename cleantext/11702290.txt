  Candidemia is associated with high mortality , and its prognostic factors need to be examined in more detail in order to improve its management. A case of breakthrough ( BT) candidemia is defined as the development of candidemia during antifungal therapy. The microbiological characteristics of and appropriate clinical practices for BT candidemia remain unclear. The primary objective of the present study was to identify the prognostic factors of candidemia , while the secondary objective was to elucidate the microbiological characteristics of patients with BT candidemia. A total of 121 patients diagnosed with candidemia between January 2007 and December 2016 were enrolled in this study. The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality rate. The overall incidence of candidemia was 0.056 cases/1000 inpatients. Among the 126 The prompt initiation of antifungal therapy and removal of central venous catheter were essential for better outcomes. A class switch to other antifungal agents needs to be considered in empirical antifungal therapy for BT candidemia with a history of exposure to azole antifungal agents.
