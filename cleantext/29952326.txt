  Private water wells have no requirements to be tested or monitored to ensure safe drinking water quality , and yet those receiving their primary drinking water from private supplies are more frequently confident that their tap drinking water is safe. Using data from surveys administered in 2008 and 2014 , this study assesses public attitudes and perceptions regarding drinking water. This study examines the results of a random sample survey of Texans to evaluate citizen awareness and attitudes on water issues. Most respondents reported that they believe their drinking water is of high quality , with 81.4 % responding that they believe their tap water is safe to drink. An even larger number , 92.1 % , of those receiving their water from private sources believe their tap water is safe. Conversely , only 57.0 % of respondents who consume bottled water as their primary source of drinking water believe their tap water is safe to drink. Additionally , more than 65 % of Texans receiving their primary drinking water from private supplies ( usually their private water well) have never had their water supply tested. A large majority ( 81.3 %) of those primarily receiving their drinking water from private supplies believed groundwater in their area to be of good or excellent quality.
