  Pulmonary carcinoid tumors are often considered indolent tumors. The prognostic significance of lymph node ( LN) metastases and the need for mediastinal dissection is controversial. We sought to determine the incidence , risk factors , and prognosis of LN metastases in resected carcinoid patients. Patients undergoing lung resection for carcinoid and removal of ≥ 10 LNs were identified in the National Cancer Database form 2004-2014. Typical ( TC) and atypical ( AC) carcinoids were included. Clinical and pathologic LN status was assessed. Overall survival ( OS) was analyzed using log-rank test and Cox hazard regression analysis. A total of 3,335 patients ( 2,893 TC , 442 AC) , underwent resection ( lobectomy/bilobectomy84 % , pneumonectomy 8 % , sublobar resection 8 %). LN involvement was present in 21 % of patients ( N1 15 % , N2 6 %) and increased with tumor size and AC histology. Tumor size was an independent predictor of LN disease. The rate of nodal upstaging was 13 % ( TC 11 % , AC 24 %). Independent predictors of OS were AC type ( HR 3.25 ( 95 % CI 2.19-4.78)) and LN metastases ( HR 2.3 ( 1.49-3.58)). LN disease was associated with worse survival for TC > 2 cm ( 5 yr OS 87 % vs. 94 % , p = 0.005) and AC ( 58 % vs. 88 % , p = 0.001) , but not for small ( ≤ 2 cm) TC patients ( 5 yr OS 93 % vs. 92 % , p = 0.67). A significant number of well-staged carcinoid patients had LN metastases. Large tumor size is a valuable predictor of carcinoid nodal disease. LN involvement was an independent predictor of worse survival. Nodal dissection in tumors > 2 cm and in atypical sub-type can yield important prognostic information.
