  The ability of remineralizing agents to improve the color of white spot lesions<symptom> ( WSL) is an important aspect that should be investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 0.05 % amorphous calcium phosphate ( ACP) , 0.5 % ACP , and 0.05 % fluoride solutions , as well as artificial saliva on the color improvement of white spot lesions<symptom> ( WSLs). In this in vitro study , 50 human premolar teeth were randomly classified into five groups. At baseline , all the samples were assessed by using a colorimeter ( E0). Then , white spot lesions<symptom> were induced on the surface of the teeth by means of a pH-cycling model , and the colorimeter was used again ( E1). Afterwards , samples of the 1st and 2nd groups were kept in 0.05 % ACP and 0.5 % ACP solutions for 1 min/day , respectively. The 3rd group specimens were placed in 0.05 % fluoride solution for 1 min/day. The other two groups were kept in artificial saliva and distilled in water separately. All the samples were assessed by the colorimeter for a third time ( E2). We found no significant difference between the groups in ∆ E1. There was also no significant difference among 0.05 % ACP solution , 0.5 % ACP solution , 0.05 % fluoride solution , and artificial saliva considering ∆ E2. However , a significant difference was noted between the above-mentioned solutions and distilled water in ∆ E2. With respect to ∆ E3 , there were considerable differences between ACP solution and artificial saliva. The same results were obtained for the difference between fluoride solution and artificial saliva. However , no significant difference was found among 0.05 % ACP , 0.5 % ACP , and 0.05 % fluoride solutions in terms of ∆ E3. In Conclusion , ACP is as effective as fluoride in the color improvement of WSLs and the recommended treatment for this purpose is daily use of 0.05 % ACP , 0.5 % ACP or 0.05 % fluoride solutions.
