  Pediatricians following clinical practice guidelines for tobacco intervention ( & ldquo; Ask , Advise , and Refer & rdquo; ( AAR)) can motivate parents to reduce child tobacco smoke exposure ( TSE). However , brief clinic interventions are unable to provide the more intensive , evidence-based behavioral treatments that facilitate the knowledge , skills , and confidence that parents need to both reduce child TSE and quit smoking. We hypothesized that a multilevel treatment model integrating pediatric clinic-level AAR with individual-level , telephone counseling would promote greater long-term ( 12-month) child TSE reduction and parent smoking cessation than clinic-level AAR alone. Pediatricians were trained to implement AAR with parents during clinic visits and reminded via prompts embedded in electronic health records. Following AAR , parents were randomized to intervention ( AAR + counseling) or nutrition education attention control ( AAR + control). Child TSE and parent quit status were bioverified. Participants ( Pediatrician advice alone may be sufficient to increase parent protections of children from TSE. Integrating clinic-level intervention with more intensive individual-level smoking intervention is necessary to promote parent cessation.
