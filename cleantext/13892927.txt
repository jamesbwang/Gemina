  Choriocarcinoma is a rare malignant germ cell tumor and it usually occurs in the gonads ( ovary or testis) and uterus. Primary hepatic choriocarcinoma ( PHC) is a variant of choriocarcinoma featuring sole liver presentation without any evidence of gonodal involvements<symptom>. Adult male patients with PHC carry dismal prognosis and their median survival period was less than 5 months. We herein present a first Korean case of a 54-year-old male patient with adult PHC , who was treated by surgical resection and chemotherapy through a multidisciplinary approach.
