  In insect innate immunity , peptidoglycan recognition proteins act as pattern recognition receptors , helping hosts combat invasive microorganisms. Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus ( BmCPV) is the main silkworm pathogen that invades the midgut columnar cell layer. We previously reported that B. mori peptidoglycan recognition protein S2 ( BmPGRP-S2) was upregulated in silkworm larvae after BmCPV infection. Here , we constructed a transgenic vector overexpressing BmPGRP-S2 under the control of a midgut-specific promoter. Transgenic silkworm lines ( PGRPS2-1 and PGRPS2-2) were generated via embryonic microinjection. BmPGRP-S2 was successfully overexpressed in transgenic silkworms and BmE cells. After oral inoculation with BmCPV , the mortality of PGRPS2-1 and PGRPS2-2 decreased by approximately 36 % and 32 % , respectively , compared with that of the non-transgenic line , and BmCPV mRNA contents were significantly lower. In the PGRPS2-1 line , imd , relish , and the antimicrobial peptide ( AMP) genes attacin2 , gloverin2 , and moricin showed increased expression after viral<disease> infection<disease>; however , the Toll pathway was not activated. These results indicate that BmPGRP-S2 overexpression can activate the Imd pathway and induce AMP upregulation , enhancing silkworm antiviral resistance.
