  We report a measurement of the dynamical polarizability of dysprosium atoms in their electronic ground state at the optical wavelength of 1064 nm , which is of particular interest for laser trapping experiments. Our method is based on collective oscillations in an optical dipole trap , and reaches unprecedented accuracy and precision by comparison with an alkali atom ( potassium) as a reference species. We obtain values of 184.4 ( 2.4) and 1.7 ( 6) a.u. for the scalar and tensor polarizability , respectively. Our experiments have reached a level that permits meaningful tests of current theoretical descriptions and provides valuable information for future experiments utilizing the intriguing properties of heavy lanthanide atoms.
