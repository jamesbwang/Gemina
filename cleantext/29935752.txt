  Although several longitudinal studies have examined the relationship between social participation and incident functional disability , the related mechanisms have remained unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms linking social participation to incident functional disability. We analyzed follow-up data for 11,992 older adults ( â‰¥ 65 years) participating in a community-based , prospective cohort study covering a 9-year period. At the baseline , the subjects were asked about three types of participation in community activities ( volunteering , hobbies , and neighborhood associations) and the frequency of their participation. Data on incident functional disability were retrieved from the public Long-term Care Insurance database. The Cox model was used to estimate the multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios of incident functional disability. We then conducted mediation analysis to assess the magnitude of the mediating effect. Among 84,760 person-years of follow-up , there were 3,984 cases of incident functional disability. The hazard ratio was 0.79 ( 95 % CI: 0.73-0.86) for participating in one type of activity , 0.82 ( 95 % CI: 0.74-0.90) for two types of activity and 0.70 ( 95 % CI: 0.64-0.77) for three types of activity in comparison with no participation in any activity. Among the estimated mediating effects , cognitive activity accounted for 9.3 % , time spent walking for 8.3 % , psychological state for 4.6 % , and social support for 2.8 % of the reduced risk of incident functional disability. The results of this population-based cohort study indicate that cognitive activity and time spent walking are important mechanisms linking social participation to incident functional disability.
