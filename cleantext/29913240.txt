  Polymorphic adenoma gene 1 ( PLAG1) is a member of the pleomorphic adenoma gene family. PLAG family of proteins as a nuclear transcription factor mainly play a role in regulating a variety of important genes in the body. The aim of this study was to examine the association of the PLAG1 polymorphism with growth traits in 566 cattle. A novel 19-bp indel mutation was identified in the PLAG1 by sequencing pooled DNA samples ( Pool-Seq) and agarose gel electrophoresis methods. The PCR products of PLAG1 exhibited 3 genotypes and 2 alleles: 142 bp ( denoted as W) and 123 bp ( denoted as D). Genotype WW and allele W were predominant in the studied populations. In addition , the 19-bp indel was significantly associated with the growth traits in cattle breeds , with the hip width and rump length of Pinan cattle ( P < 0.05) , heart girth and cannon bone circumference of Xianan cattle ( P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) , as well as the heart girth , hip width , hucklebone width , rump length , height at sacrum and chest depth of the Jiaxian cattle ( P < 0.05). Our results indicate that the Indel marker of PLAG1 gene can be used as candidate molecular markers for the breeding in cattle.
