  Investigations of neuropsychological functioning in obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD) have produced mixed results for deficits in executive functioning ( EF) , attention , and memory. One potential explanation for varied findings may relate to the heterogeneity of symptom presentations , and different clinical or neurobiological characteristics may underlie these different symptoms. We investigated differences in neuropsychological functioning between two symptoms groups , obsessing/checking ( O/C) and symmetry/ordering ( S/O) , based on data suggesting an association with different motivations: harm avoidance and incompleteness , respectively. Ten studies ( with 628 patients) were included and each investigation assessed at least one of 14 neuropsychological domains. The S/O domain demonstrated small , negative correlations with overall neuropsychological functioning , performance in EF , memory , visuospatial ability , cognitive flexibility , and verbal working memory. O/C symptoms demonstrated small , negative correlations with memory and verbal memory performance. A comparison of functioning between symptom groups identified large effect sizes showing that the S/O dimension was more strongly related to poorer neuropsychological performance overall , and in the domains of attention , visuospatial ability , and the subdomain of verbal working memory. Findings support existing evidence suggesting that different OCD symptoms , and their associated core motivations , relate to unique patterns of neuropsychological functioning , and , potentially dysfunction in different neural circuits.
