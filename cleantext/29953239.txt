  Spin-orbit torques , which utilize spin currents arising from the spin-orbit coupling , offer a novel method for the electrical switching of the magnetization with perpendicular anisotropy. However , the necessity of an external magnetic field to achieve deterministic switching is an obstacle for realizing practical spin-orbit torque devices with all-electric operation. Here , we report field-free spin-orbit torque switching by exploiting the domain-wall motion in an anti-notched microwire with perpendicular anisotropy , which exhibits multidomain states stabilized by the domain-wall surface tension. The combination of spin-orbit torque , Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions , and domain-wall surface-tension-induced geometrical pinning allows the deterministic control of the domain wall and offers a novel method to achieve a field-free spin-orbit torque switching. Our work demonstrates the proof of concept of a perpendicular memory cell that can be readily adopted in three-terminal magnetic memory.
