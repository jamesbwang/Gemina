  Health risk from nitrate was predicted for different scenarios of vegetable consumption and nitrate contents in Iran. Finally , certain management scenarios were presented for nitrate risk mitigation under worst-case scenario considering each vegetable contribution in nitrate intake. Two fruit ( bell pepper and tomato) and two leafy vegetables ( lettuce and mint) were sampled in a combined randomized method from fields , greenhouses , and markets of Isfahan province , Iran during October to December 2015. To assess the potential health impacts of nitrate from the vegetable ingestion , the present status and three different scenarios of increasing vegetable consumption and/or increasing plant nitrate concentrations were considered. Two management scenarios for reducing the total nitrate intake below the allowable values were predicted. By increasing vegetable consumption under scenario 1 and nitrate concentration under scenario 3 , the total hazard quotient ( THQs) was increased , although the highest increase ( 12-fold) in the THQs was provided by lettuce. Health risk from nitrate for sensitive groups was effectively reduced by a 70 % decrease in lettuce nitrate concentration. In the second management scenario , decreasing upper nitrate concentrations in the other sources ( except lettuce) by 30 % declined nitrate intake in children ( < 6 years old) and boys ( 7-14 years old) below acceptable daily intake ( ADI). By taking into account the increases in the amounts of consumption and nitrate in vegetables at different scenarios , it was revealed that the critical factor for a high dietary exposure to nitrate is not the absolute amount of vegetables consumed but the type of vegetable ( lettuce) and the concentration of nitrate related to the conditions of production. Therefore , to manage any risks to human health from dietary nitrate exposure resulting from vegetable consumption , focus on lettuce instead of taking other vegetables equally into account is needed.
