  The gut microbiota- the trillions of bacteria that reside within the gastrointestinal tract- has been found to not only be an essential component immune and metabolic health , but also seems to influence development and diseases of the enteric and central nervous system , including motility disorders , behavioral disorders , neurodegenerative disease , cerebrovascular accidents , and neuroimmune-mediated disorders. By leveraging animal models , several different pathways of communication have been identified along the `` gut-brain-axis '' including those driven by the immune system , the vagus nerve , or by modulation of neuroactive compounds by the microbiota. Of the latter , bacteria have been shown to produce and/or consume a wide range of mammalian neurotransmitters , including dopamine , norepinephrine , serotonin , or gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA). Accumulating evidence in animals suggests that manipulation of these neurotransmitters by bacteria may have an impact in host physiology , and preliminary human studies are showing that microbiota-based interventions can also alter neurotransmitter levels. Nonetheless , substantially more work is required to determine whether microbiota-mediated manipulation of human neurotransmission has any physiological implications , and if so , how it may be leveraged therapeutically. In this review this exciting route of communication along the gut-brain-axis , and accompanying data , are discussed.
