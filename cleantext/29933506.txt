  Postmarketing surveillance is useful to collect safety data in real-world clinical settings. In this study , we applied postmarketing real-world data on a mechanistic model analysis for neutropenic profiles of eribulin in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Demographic and safety data were collected using an active surveillance method from eribulin-treated recurrent or metastatic breast cancer patients. Changes in neutrophil counts over time were analyzed using a mechanistic pharmacodynamic model. Pathophysiological factors that might affect the severity of neutropenia were investigated , and neutropenic patterns were simulated for different treatment schedules. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from 401 patients ( 5199 neutrophil count measurements) who had not received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and were eligible for pharmacodynamic analysis. The estimated mean parameters were as follows: mean transit time = 104.5 h , neutrophil proliferation rate constant = 0.0377 h
