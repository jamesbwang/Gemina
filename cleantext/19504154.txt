  Computed Tomography ( CT) with myelogram is a relatively safe procedure. It requires the use of nonionic contrast agents which , unlike ionic contrast agents , have been associated with low complication rates. We report a case of a 69-year-old female who developed diffuse bilateral cerebral edema<symptom> following a lumber myelogram with the use of intrathecal nonionic contrast agent Omnipaque ( Iohexol) 300. We were able to find one other reported case of cerebral edema<symptom> following the use of intrathecal nonionic contrast agent in the literature.
