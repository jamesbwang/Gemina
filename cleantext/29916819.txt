  Magnetic sensors based on magnetoresistance effects have promising application prospects due to their excellent sensitivity and their advantages in terms of integration. However , the competition between higher sensitivity and a larger measuring range remains a problem. Here , we propose a novel mechanism for designing magnetoresistive sensors: probing the perpendicular field by detecting the expansion of the elastic magnetic domain wall in the free layer of a spin valve or a magnetic tunnel junction. The performances of devices based on this mechanism , such as the sensitivity and the measuring range , can be tuned by manipulating the geometry of the device. This can be achieved without changing the intrinsic properties of the material , thus promising a higher integration level and a better performance. The mechanism is theoretically explained based on the experimental results. Two examples are proposed and their functionality and performances are verified via a micromagnetic simulation.
