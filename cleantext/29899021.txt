  Statins have shown promise as anticancer agents in experimental and epidemiologic research. However , any benefit that they provide is likely context-dependent , for example , applicable only to certain cancers or in combination with specific anticancer drugs. We report that inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase ( HMGCR) using statins enhances the proapoptotic activity of the B cell lymphoma-2 ( BCL2) inhibitor venetoclax ( ABT-199) in primary leukemia<disease> and lymphoma cells but not in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. By blocking mevalonate production , HMGCR inhibition suppressed protein geranylgeranylation , resulting in up-regulation of proapoptotic protein p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis ( PUMA). In support of these findings , dynamic BH3 profiling confirmed that statins primed cells for apoptosis. Furthermore , in retrospective analyses of three clinical studies of chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> , background statin use was associated with enhanced response to venetoclax , as demonstrated by more frequent complete responses. Together , this work provides mechanistic justification and clinical evidence to warrant prospective clinical investigation of this combination in hematologic malignancies.
