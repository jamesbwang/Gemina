  Mammalian tooth wear research reveals contrasting patterns seemingly linked to diet: irregularly pitted enamel surfaces , possibly from consuming hard seeds , versus roughly aligned linearly grooved surfaces , associated with eating tough leaves. These patterns are important for assigning diet to fossils , including hominins. However , experiments establishing conditions necessary for such damage challenge this paradigm. Lucas
