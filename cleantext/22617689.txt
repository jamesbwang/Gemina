  To provide a detailed description of characteristics at hospital admission and clinical outcomes at 30-day and 6-month follow-up in patients hospitalised with coronary artery disease ( CAD) in a poor South-East Asian setting. Prospective observational cohort study. From February 2013 to December 2014 , in Makassar Cardiac Center , Indonesia. 477 patients with CAD ( acute coronary syndrome<pathogen> and stable CAD). All-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE). Out of 477 patients with CAD , the proportion of young age ( < 60 years) was 53.9 % and 72.7 % were male. At admission , 44.2 % of patients were diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) , 38.6 % with diagnosis or signs of heart<pathogen> failure<pathogen> and 75.1 % had previous hypertension. Out of 211 patients with STEMI , only 4.7 % had been treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) and 6.2 % received thrombolysis. The time lapse from symptom onset to hospital admission was 26.8 ( IQR 10.0-48.0) hours , and 19.1 % of all patients had undergone either PCI or coronary artery bypass graft. The survival rate at 6 months was 78.9 %. The rates of all-cause mortality at 30 days and 6 months were 13.4 % and 7.3 % , respectively; the rate of composite MACE at 30 days was 26.2 % and 18.0 % at 6 months. Patients with CAD from a poor South-East Asian setting present themselves with predominantly unstable conditions of premature CAD. These patients show relatively severe illness , have significant time delay from symptom onset to admission or intervention , and most do not receive the guidelines-recommended treatment. Awareness of symptoms , prompt initial management of acute CVD , well-established infrastructures and resources both in primary and secondary hospital for CVD should be improved to reduce the high rates of 30-day and 6-month mortality and adverse outcomes in this population.
