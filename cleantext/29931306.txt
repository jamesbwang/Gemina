  The main outcome of molecular dating , the timetree , provides crucial information for understanding the evolutionary history of lineages and is a requirement of several evolutionary analyses. Although essential , the estimation of divergence times from molecular data is frequently regarded as a complicated task. However , establishing biological timescales can be performed in a straightforward manner , even with large , genome-wide datasets. This protocol presents all the necessary steps to estimate a timetree in the program MEGA X. It also illustrates how the Timetree resource can be a useful tool to obtain chronological information based on previous studies , therefore yielding calibration boundaries.
