  Magnesium ( Mg) bioabsorbable screws are new biomaterials used in fracture fixation. In the current literature , there is only one case report on the use of magnesium bio-absorbable screws in ankle fractures. Within the present study , a 19-year-old female who sustained an isolated lateral malleolar fracture was treated with open reduction and intramedullary Mg screw fixation and then followed up for two years. Fracture union was achieved without any complication such as failure of fixation , loss of reduction , infection , or any other adverse reaction. Mg bioabsorbable screws are an alternative method of fracture fixation as compared to conventional metallic implants since they eliminate the need for implant removal.
