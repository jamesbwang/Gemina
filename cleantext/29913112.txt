  Behavioral and emotional problems can lead to severe restrictions in the functioning of children and to an impaired development. The types of support for children vary greatly between care providers. The aim of this study is to apply the Taxonomy of Care for Youth ( TOCFY) and to make an inventory of the core elements and program elements of the various types of support for children with behavioral and emotional problems that were offered overall and per main types of providers in a delineated region. We assessed the types of support to children ( N = 621) by applying TOCFY. The study showed that by using Tocfy we could make an inventory of the various types of support offered. ` Individual child support ' and ` family support ' were provided most often , and therefore , most interventions were aimed at the child or at the child and his/her parents/caretakers. Support was mostly provided without judicial interference and within an ambulatory/outpatient or home-based setting. TOCFY could be helpful by mapping of information on the support offered to children across various types of care providers. More information on the core and program elements of these types of support may help to optimize care for children and their families.
