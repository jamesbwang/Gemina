  Aerospace provides a strong driving force for technological development. Recently a novel class of composites for harsh environments , based on ultra-high temperature ceramic composites reinforced with continuous fibers ( UHTCMC) , is being developed. The goal of this work is to overcome the current data patchwork about their microstructural optimization and structural behavior , by showing a consistent mechanical characterization of well-defined and developed UHTCMCs based on ZrB
