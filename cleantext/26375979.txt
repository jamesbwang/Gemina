  Evaluation of the face validity of a new artificial model of an infant temporal bone ( TB) suitable for surgical training , including cochlear implantation. Micro-computer-tomography images were obtained from a TB specimen of a 1-year-old normal infant available in an anatomical collection. The TB model was designed and constructed using these images and techniques known from similar models of adult TB. Fifteen otology departments in Austria , Germany , and Switzerland rated the infant TB model and compared it with the established adult TB model manufactured commercially by the same company. The otologists responded to a semi-quantitative questionnaire with a rating scale ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree) to 5 ( strongly agree). Macroscopic and microscopic anatomic details , drilling experience , and surgical landmarks were rated. The surgical procedures included mastoidectomy , posterior tympanotomy , cochleostomy , and insertion of a cochlear electrode. Overall ratings were similar ( 3.9) for both the infant and the adult TB models , with ranges of 3.47 to 4.47 ( infant model) and 3.5 to 4.33 ( adult model). Ratings of specific anatomical details differed as a function of type of model , but without preference of one model over the other. Infant TB models can be used similarly as adult TB models for surgical training , including cochlear implantation. They may deserve a more important role in surgical training because cadaveric human temporal bones of infants are not available.
