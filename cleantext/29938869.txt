  Halophilic protozoa are independently scattered across the molecular phylogeny of eukaryotes; most of which are assigned to Heterolobosea. Here , we isolated a biflagellate from a hypersaline water of 342 ‰ salinity. This isolate shared several morphological features with typical halophilic heterolobosean flagellates. In addition , molecular phylogenetic trees of the 18S rRNA gene sequences clearly indicated flagellate is a heterolobosean species closely related to the halophilic Tulamoebidae. However , the flagellate was not accommodated to any described genus. Cells were ovoid-shaped , and no amoebae were observed. The two unequal flagella beat heterodynamically. An ear-like bulge at the margin of a cytostomal groove was observed. Flagellates could grow at 100-200 ‰ salinity , suggesting an obligately halophilic species. Currently , it appears that the new halophilic Aurem hypersalina forms a strong clade with Tulamoebidae , and is sister to the Tulamoebidae , indicating that this new clade is composed almost entirely of obligate halophilic taxa. Thus , A. hypersalina and the Tulamoebidae clade currently represent a unique adaptive radiation of halophilic eukaryotes.
