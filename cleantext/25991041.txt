  Immunotactoid glomerulopathy ( ITG) is a rare glomerulonephritis<disease> characterized by microtubular deposits. Immunofluorescence findings are necessary to differentiate ITG from other proliferative glomerular diseases. The characteristic tubular structure on electron microscopy is essential for a definitive diagnosis , and the diameter of the structure has been traditionally used for differentiating between ITG and other types of glomerulonephritis<disease> with organized deposits. In recent years , the disease concept of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance , which is associated with M protein produced by plasma cell tumors , has been proposed. This was a peculiar case of ITG with underlying monoclonal gammopathy in which IgG showed a false-negative result with immunofluorescence using frozen sections. Additional examinations using a different clone of the anti-IgG antibody revealed typical IgG staining. C4d was strongly positive , consistent with immune complex type glomerulonephritis<disease> This case highlights unusual features of ITG , and provides a practical hint to avoid a diagnostic pitfall.
