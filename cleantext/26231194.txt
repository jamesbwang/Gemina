  To compare the differences between the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO) criteria of the 48-hour window and the 7-day window in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury ( AKI) in very elderly patients , as well as the relationship between the 48-hour and 7-day windows for diagnosis and 90-day mortality. We retrospectively enrolled very elderly patients ( â‰¥ 75 years old) from the geriatrics department of the Chinese PLA General Hospital between January 2007 and December 2015. AKI patients were divided into 48-hour and 7-day groups by their diagnosis criteria. AKI patients were divided into survivor and nonsurvivor groups by their outcomes within 90 days after diagnosis of AKI. In total , 652 patients were included in the final analysis. The median age of the cohort was 87 ( 84-91) years , the majority ( 623 , 95.6 %) of whom were male. Of the 652 AKI patients , 334 cases ( 51.2 %) were diagnosed with AKI by the 48-hour window for diagnosis , while 318 cases ( 48.8 %) were by the 7-day window for diagnosis. The 90-day mortality was 42.5 % in patients with 48-hour window AKI and 24.2 % in patients with 7-day window AKI. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that 90-day mortality was lower in the 7-day window AKI group than in the 48-hour window AKI group ( log rank: The 90-day mortality was higher in 48-hour window AKI than in 7-day window AKI in very elderly patients. The 48-hour KDIGO window definition may be less sensitive. The 48-hour KDIGO window definition is significantly better correlated with subsequent mortality and is , therefore , still appropriate for clinical use. Finding early , sensitive biomarkers of kidney damage is a future direction of research.
