  Breath sound<symptom> parameters have been suggested to be new biomarkers of airway function in patients with asthma. We investigated the effect of bronchodilation on breath sound<symptom> parameters in sixty-four children ( mean age , 8.9 years; range , 6-16 years) using a breath sound<symptom> analyzer. The breath sound<symptom> parameters included frequency limiting 50 % and 99 % of the power spectrum ( F The spectrum curve indices , A The spectrum curve indices indicated bronchodilation , and may be useful for the assessment of bronchial reversibility in children with asthma.
