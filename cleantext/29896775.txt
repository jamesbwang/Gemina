  Boiled Wuding chicken was produced using whole chicken by washing , boiling 1 h with salt , deep frying and boiling 2 h. The effect of process on the WLOM ( water-soluble lower molecule) profiles of products was characterized using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( The metabonome was dominated by 49 WLOM and 22 fatty acid compounds were detected. PC1 and PC2 explained a total of 93.4 % and 3 % of variance , respectively. Compared with control group , the total WLOM and fatty acid content of the chicken breast were significantly decreased in other three processing stages ( P < 0.05). Comprehensive multivariate data analysis showed significant differences about precursor substance between the different processing including creatine , lactate , creatinine , glucose , taurine , anserine and acetate ( P < 0.05). These results contribute to a more accurate understanding of precursor substance changes of flavor in chicken meat during processing. Boiled treated chicken had significant effects on fatty acid and WLOM compounds. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
