  Despite advances in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in recent decades , patients experience high levels of depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , stress , and insomnia. Since the calming effect of Melissa officinalis ( MO) has been known , this study aimed to determine the effects of MO supplementation on depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , stress , and sleep disturbances in patients with chronic stable angina ( CSA). In this double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial , 80 patients with CSA were divided randomly into two groups ( taking 3 g MO supplement or placebo daily for 8 weeks). The shortened 21-item version of the depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> and stress scale ( DASS-21) test and Pittsburgh sleep quality index were done before and after the intervention. At the end of the study , the intervention group receiving MO capsules had a significant reduction in scores of depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , stress , and total sleep disturbance , compared with the placebo group ( P < 0.05). The results showed that 8-week supplementation with 3 g MO can decrease depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , stress , and sleep disorder in patients with CSA.
