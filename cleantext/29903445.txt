  This chapter deals with chemical and hematologic investigations which are often considered in the diagnostic workup of subacute to chronic cerebellar ataxias<symptom>. Relevant investigations in blood ( serum , plasma) , urine , and cerebrospinal fluid are discussed. Particular attention is paid to early diagnosis of treatable metabolic ataxias<symptom> ( such as abetalipoproteinemia , coenzyme Q10 deficiency , cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis , glucose transporter type 1 deficiency , Refsum disease , and vitamin E deficiency) , but autoimmune ataxias<symptom> , other vitamin deficiencies , and endocrine disorders should also be kept in mind. Adequate interpretation of test results has to consider age-specific reference values. The selection of investigations should mainly be driven by the overall clinical context , considering gender , history , age , and mode of presentation , cerebellar and other neurologic as well as extraneurologic findings.
