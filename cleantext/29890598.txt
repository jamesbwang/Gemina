  With the growing prevalence of obesity , an increased number of bariatric surgeries are being performed. Lipophilic persistent organic pollutants ( POPs) are stored in adipose tissue , and an increased release of lipophilic POPs into the blood circulation may occur following rapid<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom> such as after bariatric surgery. To evaluate and compare POP levels in serum before and after bariatric surgery , and to assess if the POP levels exceeded health based guideline values , with particular focus on women of childbearing age ( WCBA). Serum samples from 63 patients before and one year after bariatric surgery were analysed for organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs); polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs); and brominated flame retardants ( BFRs). Mean weight<symptom> loss<symptom> one year after surgery was 32.1 kg. The levels of all the analysed POPs in serum increased during the study period. Median levels of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( p , p '- DDE) , hexachlorobenzen ( HCB) and PCB-153 increased from 90.2 ng/g lipid weight ( lw) to 158.5 ng/glw , from 21.1 ng/glw to 36.4 ng/glw and from 48.7 ng/glw to 71.5 ng/glw , respectively. The highest percentage increase was observed for PCB -138 , with 83.1 %. BFRs were detected in low sample numbers and at low levels. Guideline values for ΣPCB Weight<symptom> loss<symptom> after bariatric surgery resulted in increases of POPs levels in serum between 46.7 % -83.1 %. Guideline values for ΣPCB
