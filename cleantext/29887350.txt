  This paper is focused to reflect the changes in burn mortality and events leading to fatal burn injuries. Two national community-based cross sectional health and injury surveys were done in Bangladesh during 2003 and 2016. Similar methodology had been followed in both the surveys. Multistage cluster sampling method considering probability-proportional-to-size strategy was used in both the surveys to obtain the desired sample. A pretested semi-structured questionnaire was deployed to identify causes of mortality and morbidity among the population. Verbal autopsy method was used to ascertain the cause of death. An estimated 5000 deaths occurred during 2002 due to burn , whereas , around 9000 deaths were caused by burn in 2015 reflected by the death rates 3.5 and 5.7 per 100,000 population in respective years. This study found an increase in death rates in all age groups from 2002 to 2015. Electrocution caused the highest burn deaths in this country , especially among males and in rural areas. The death toll by this particular mechanism has increased by more than two folds within a decade. The place of occurrence of fatal burn injuries has also shifted from home to the outside of the home especially in the agricultural fields. Burn death is an emerging cause of injury deaths in Bangladesh. Further researches are required to explore the epidemiology of electrocution deaths in Bangladesh and design effective interventions.
