  Predictable coverage of deep isolated mandibular gingival recessions is one of the most challenging endeavors in plastic-esthetic periodontal surgery , and limited data is available in the literature. The aim of this paper is to present the rationale , the step-by-step procedure , and the results obtained in a series of 24 patients treated by means of a novel surgical technique ( the laterally closed tunnel ( LCT)) specifically designed for deep isolated mandibular recessions. A total of 24 healthy patients ( 21 women and 3 men , mean age 25.75 ± 7.12 years) exhibiting one single deep mandibular Miller Class I ( n = 4) , II ( n = 10) , or III ( n = 10) gingival recession ≥ 4 mm were consecutively treated with LCT in conjunction with an enamel matrix derivative ( EMD) and palatal subepithelial connective tissue graft ( SCTG). The following clinical parameters were assessed at baseline and 12 months postoperatively: probing depth ( PD) , clinical attachment level ( CAL) , complete root coverage ( CRC) , mean root coverage ( MRC) , recession depth ( RD) , and keratinized tissue width ( KTW). The primary outcome variable was CRC. The postoperative morbidity was low , and no complications , such as bleeding , infections/abscesses , or loss of SCTG , occurred. At 12 months , CRC was obtained in 17 of the 24 defects ( 70.83 %) , while in the remaining 7 defects RC amounted to 80 % to 90 % ( in 6 cases) and 79 % ( in 1 case). Of the 17 defects exhibiting CRC , 12 were central incisors and 5 were canines. With respect to defect type , CRC was found in 3 of the 4 Miller Class I , 8 of the 10 Class II , and in 6 of the 10 Class III defects. Mean RD changed from 5.14 ± 1.26 mm at baseline to 0.2 ± 0.37 mm at 12 months , while MRC amounted to 4.94 ± 1.19 mm , representing 96.11 % ( P < .0001). Mean KTW increased from 1.41 ± 1.00 mm at baseline to 4.14 ± 1.67 mm ( P < .0001) at 12 months , yielding a KTW gain of 2.75 ± 1.52 ( P < .0001). No statistically significant changes in mean PD occurred following root coverage surgery ( 1.8 ± 0.2 mm at baseline and 2.1 ± 0.3 mm at 12 months). The present results suggest that the LCT is a valuable approach for the treatment of deep isolated mandibular Miller Class I , II , and III gingival recessions.
