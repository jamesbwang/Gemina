  We study the effect of a large obstacle on the so-called residence time , i.e. , the time that a particle performing a symmetric random walk in a rectangular ( two-dimensional , 2D) domain needs to cross the strip. We observe complex behavior: We find out that the residence time does not depend monotonically on the geometric properties of the obstacle , such as its width , length , and position. In some cases , due to the presence of the obstacle , the mean residence time is shorter with respect to the one measured for the obstacle-free strip. We explain the residence time behavior by developing a one-dimensional ( 1D) analog of the 2D model where the role of the obstacle is played by two defect sites having smaller probability to be crossed with respect to all the other regular sites. The 1D and 2D models behave similarly , but in the 1D case we are able to compute exactly the residence time , finding a perfect match with the Monte Carlo simulations.
