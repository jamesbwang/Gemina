  No medical intervention has been identified that decreases acute kidney injury and improves renal outcome at 1-year after cardiac surgery. To determine whether administration of nitric oxide reduces the incidence of post-operative acute kidney injury and improves long-term kidney outcomes after multiple cardiac valve replacement requiring prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass. 244 Patients undergoing elective , multiple valve replacement surgery mostly due to rheumatic fever<disease> were randomized to receive either nitric oxide ( treatment) or nitrogen ( control). Nitric oxide and nitrogen were administered via the gas exchanger during cardiopulmonary bypass and by inhalation for 24h post-operatively. Primary outcome: Oxidation of ferrous plasma oxyhemoglobin to ferric methemoglobin was associated to a reduced post-operative acute kidney injury from 64 % ( control group) to 50 % ( nitric oxide) ( RR , 95 % CI; 0.78 , 0.62-0.97 ;P = 0.014). At 90-days , transition to stage 3 chronic kidney disease was reduced from 33 % in the controls to 21 % in the treatment group ( RR , 95 % CI; 0.64 , 0.41- 0.99 ;P = 0.024); and at 1-year , from 31 % to 18 % ( RR , 95 % CI; 0.59 , 0.36- 0.96 ;P = 0.017). Nitric oxide treatment reduced the overall major adverse kidney events at 30-days ( RR , 95 % CI; 0.40 , 0.18- 0.92 ;P = 0.016 , 90-days ( RR , 95 % CI; 0.40 , 0.17- 0.92 ;P = 0.015 and 1-year ( RR , 95 % CI; 0.47 , 0.20-1.10 ;P = 0.041). In patients undergoing multiple valve replacement and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass , administration of nitric oxide decreased the incidence of acute kidney injury , transition to stage 3 chronic kidney disease and major adverse kidney events at 30-days , 90-days , and 1-year. Clinical trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT01802619).
