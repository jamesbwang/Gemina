  Iron delivery to the brain is essential for multiple neurological processes such as myelination , neurotransmitter synthesis , and energy production. Loss of brain iron homeostasis is a significant factor in multiple neurological disorders. Understanding the mechanism by which the transport of iron across the blood-brain barrier ( BBB) is regulated is crucial to address the impact of iron deficiency on brain development and excessive accumulation of iron in neurodegenerative diseases. Using induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC)- derived brain endothelial cells ( huECs) as a human BBB model , we demonstrate the ability of transferrin , hepcidin , and DMT1 to impact iron transport and release. Our model reveals a new function for H-ferritin to transport iron across the BBB by binding to the T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin receptor 1. We show that huECs secrete both transferrin and H-ferritin , which can serve as iron sources for the brain. Based on our data , brain iron status can exert control of iron transport across the endothelial cells that constitute the BBB. These data address a number of pertinent questions such as how brain iron uptake is regulated at the regional level , the source of iron delivery to the brain , and the clinical strategies for attempting to treat brain iron deficiency.
