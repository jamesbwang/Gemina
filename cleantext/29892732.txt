  The hydrogen abstraction reactions of phenyl formate ( PF) by different radicals ( H/O ( 3P)/ OH/HO2) were theoretically investigated. We calculated the reaction energetics for PF + H/O/OH using the composite method ROCBS-QB3// M06-2X/ cc-pVTZ and that for PF + HO2 at the M06-2X/ cc-pVTZ level of theory. The high-pressure limit rate constants were calculated using the transition state theory in conjunction with the 1-D hindered rotor approximation and tunneling correction. Three-parameter Arrhenius expressions of rate constants were provided over the temperature range of 500-2000 K. To validate the theoretical calculations , the overall rate constants of PF + OH â†’ Products were measured in shock<symptom> tube experiments at 968-1128 K and 1.16-1.25 atm using OH laser absorption. The predicted overall rate constants agree well with the shock<symptom> tube data ( within 15 %) over the entire experimental conditions. Rate constant analysis indicates that the H-abstraction at the formic acid site dominates the PF consumption , whereas the contribution of H-abstractions at the aromatic ring increases with temperature. Additionally , comparisons of site-specific H-abstractions from PF with methyl formate , ethyl formate , benzene , and toluene were performed to understand the effects of the aromatic ring and side-chain substituent on H-abstraction rate constants.
