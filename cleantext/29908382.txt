  To compare the clinical outcomes and postoperative complications between open-door laminoplasty ( ODL) versus French-door laminoplasty ( FDL) for the treatment of cervical multilevel compressive myelopathy. We comprehensively searched PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane library , and China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( CNKI) to identify relevant articles. The search results were last updated on January 1 , 2018. All values of weighted mean difference ( WMD) and odds ratio ( OR) are expressed as ODL relative to FDL. A total of six studies containing 430 patients were included in our meta-analysis. In randomized controlled trials , there was no significant difference in Japanese Orthopaedic Association ( JOA) scores between ODL and FDL groups ( WMD = 0.06; 95 % CL: -0.52 to 0.64; P = 0.84). However , in the retrospective trials , JOA scores were significantly higher in the ODL group than in the FDL group ( WMD = 0.95; 95 % CL: 0.55 to 1.34; P < 0.05). The pooled data revealed the magnitude of spinal canal expansion in the ODL group was higher than in the FDL group ( WMD = 24.39 %; 95 % CI: 12.33 to 36.45; P < 0.05). The present meta-analysis showed that the magnitude of canal expansion was higher with ODL than with FDL. There is a lack of compelling evidence to prove the superiority of one procedure over the other.
