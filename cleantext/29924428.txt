  Some conditions are already known to be associated with increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Other conditions may also be significant indicators of increased risk. The aim of the study was to identify conditions for inclusion in a fracture prediction model ( FREM- Fracture Risk Evaluation Model) for automated case finding of high-risk individuals of hip or major osteoporotic fractures ( MOF). We included the total population in Denmark aged 45 + years ( N = 2,495,339). All hospital diagnoses from 1998 to 2012 were used as possible conditions and the primary outcome was MOF during 2013. Our cohort was split randomly 50-50 into a development and a validation dataset for deriving and validating the predictive model. We applied backward selection on ICD-10 codes by logistic regression to develop an age-adjusted and sex-stratified model. FREM for MOF included 38 and 43 risk factors for women and men , respectively. Testing FREM for MOF in the validation cohort showed good accuracy as it produced ROC curves with an AUC of 0.750 ( 95 % CI 0.741 , 0.795) and 0.752 ( 95 % CI 0.743 , 0.761) for women and men , respectively FREM for hip fractures included 32 risk factors for both genders and showed an even higher accuracy in the validation cohort as AUC of 0.874 ( 95 % CI 0.869 , 0.879) and 0.851 ( 95 % CI 0.841 , 0.861) for women and men was found. We have developed and tested a prediction model ( FREM) for identifying men and women at high risk of MOF or hip fractures by using solely existing administrative data. FREM could be employed either at the point of care integrated into Electronic Patient Record systems to alert physicians or deployed centrally in a national case finding strategy where patients at high fracture risk could be invited to a focused DXA program.
