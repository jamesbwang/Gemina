  Open surgery remains the standard strategy for management of esophageal diverticulum in symptomatic patients. However , in the last years an increasing number of minimally invasive approaches have been proposed for this issue in order to reduce the surgical trauma and favor a fast return to daily activity. Herein , we describe a novel technique as uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS) for performing resection of esophageal diverticulum. This procedure was successfully carried out in three consecutive patients with giant mid-esophageal diverticulum ( mean size: 6.5 ± 0.5 cm). The mean post-operative time was 121 ± 10 minutes. The chest drain was removed 48 hours later in all cases and the mean length of hospital stay was 9 ± 1 days. No intraoperative neither postoperative complications were found in all patients but one. He had a small fistula 15 days later that was successfully treated with stent insertion. No recurrence of diverticulum was seen in all cases. Uniportal VATS is a feasible procedure that in theory could reduce the surgical trauma compared to standard open approach. However , future prospective studies should corroborate our impression before it can be recommended as acceptable therapy.
