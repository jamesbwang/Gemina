  A 17-year-old male post anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction complained of the inability to extend his great toe immediately following surgery. Neurological injuries following knee arthroscopy have been reported to occur between 0.6 % -2.5 %. The most commonly injured nerves are the saphenous and common fibular nerve ( CFN). Great toe-drop secondary to isolated denervation of the extensor hallucis longus ( EHL) , has only been reported one time in the literature. This report describes a case of isolated denervation of the EHL following knee cruciate ligament reconstruction. A detailed description of the anatomy of the CFN is reviewed as well as how electroneuromyographic ( EMG/NCS) testing can assist in the diagnosis , prognosis , and intervention of this type of injury. EHL paralysis did not functionally limit the patient from participating in a post-surgical rehabilitation regime. The patient successfully completed his ACL reconstruction rehabilitation and was released to return to sporting activities 9 months postsurgery. Twelve months post-surgery , the patient regained full great toe extension and strength. It is important to note that physical therapists can identify the need for , refer , and in some instances perform EMG/NCS testing on patients with neuromuscular disorders. Isolated injury of the CFN branch that innervates the EHL is extremely rare. Understanding the anatomy of the CFN and its branches is critical for the physical therapist when performing an examination and interpreting the findings. It is also important to understand the potential causes and management approaches following this type of injury.
