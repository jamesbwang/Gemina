  Because lysine-specific demethylase 1 ( LSD1) regulates the maintenance of cancer stem cell properties , small-molecule inhibitors of LSD1 are expected to be useful for the treatment of several cancers. Reversible inhibitors of LSD1 with submicromolar inhibitory potency have recently been reported , but their exact binding modes are poorly understood. In this study , we synthesized a recently reported reversible inhibitor , 4- ( 5- ( piperidin-4-ylmethoxy) -2- (
