  The structure of cucurbit ( 6) uril ( CB ( 6)) , as a fascinating supramolecular receptor , is regarded as ` indestructible '. Herein , we investigated the hydrolysis of CB ( 6) catalysed by alkali. Our results showed that CB ( 6) was easily hydrolysed in 30 % NaOH at 160 Â°C within 3 h. Separation and purification of hydrolytic products demonstrated the presence of NH
