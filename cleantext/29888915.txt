  An environmentally friendly approach for the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline promoted by carbonaceous bio-based materials was successfully achieved under subcritical water conditions. The proposed methodology features a metal-free process , no-hydrogen input as reductor , the use of commercial bio-based carbon materials having low cost and availability , and water as green solvent under subcritical conditions. Using optimized conditions , reduction of nitrobenzene in the presence of commercial NORIT GAC 12-40 or DACARB PC1000 was accomplished at 310 Â°C for 6 h and quantitatively furnished the target aniline. Treatment of NORIT GAC 12-40 with KOH allowed to decrease charcoal loading ( 6 g vs 40 g) and increase aniline yields ( 80 % vs 66 %).
