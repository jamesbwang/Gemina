  Multiple treatment modalities were introduced for treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS) but mostly with unsatisfactory results. In this prospective randomized right-left intra-individual controlled study , we studied the safety and efficacy of combined treatment with fractional CO Twenty adult patients with HS were randomized into this study. The patients were randomly allocated to receive four laser sessions with 2 weeks interval. Control side received long pulsed Nd: YAG laser ( 1064 nm) only , and the other side ( combined treatment side) received combined fractional CO Statistically significant higher improvement and patient 's satisfaction was observed in combined treatment side compared with control side ( P = 0.011 , 0.048 respectively). Absence of recurrence was achieved by 55 % of sides receiving combined treatment and 35 % of control sides. Combination of fractional CO
