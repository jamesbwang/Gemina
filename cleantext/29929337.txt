  This cohort study explores the contribution of wastewater irrigation , in the context of WASH ( Water , Sanitation , Hygiene) , on in-household water contamination among urban farming households in Ahmedabad , India. Drinking water samples of 204 households in four peri-urban farming communities were collected from the point-of-source ( PoS) and point-of-use ( PoU) of each household four times over the 12-month follow-up period. Next to the quantification of E coli , three household surveys ( baseline , hygiene and farm) were conducted. Additionally , an observational spot-check was undertaken in bi-monthly intervals throughout the follow-up period. Significant positive differences in water quality between PoS and PoU samples were identified in 78 % of households. During the monsoon , the peak of contamination , only 6 % of households had access to safe drinking water at PoU. The Average Treatment Effect ( ATE) of wastewater irrigation indicates an adverse effect on in-household water contamination , larger in effect size than the mitigation effect of access to sanitation or personal hygiene. To control transmission of fecal pathogens , effective barriers are required for wastewater irrigation similar to the necessity of ensuring access to sanitation and practicing adequate hygiene behavior.
