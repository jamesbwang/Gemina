  Many older individuals receive rehabilitation in an out-of-hospital setting ( OOHS) after acute hospitalization; however , its effect on mobility and unplanned hospital readmission is unclear. Therefore a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on this topic. Medline OVID , Embase OVID , and Cinahl were searched from their inception until February 22 , 2018. OOHS ( i.e. , skilled nursing facilities , outpatient clinics , or community-based at home) randomized trials studying the effect of multidisciplinary rehabilitation were selected , including those assessing exercise in older patients ( mean age â‰¥ 65 years) after discharge from hospital following an acute illness. Two reviewers independently selected the studies , performed independent data extraction , and assessed the risk of bias. Outcomes were pooled using fixed- or random-effect models as appropriate. The main outcomes were mobility at and unplanned hospital readmission within 3 months of discharge. Fifteen studies ( 1255 patients) were included in the systematic review and twelve were included in the meta-analysis ( seven assessing mobility using the 6-minute walk distance ( 6MWD) test and seven assessing unplanned hospital readmission). Based on the 6MWD , patients receiving rehabilitation walked an average of 23 m more than controls ( 95 % CI: -1.34-48.32; I OOHS-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation leads to improved mobility in older patients 3 months after they are discharged from hospital following an acute illness and is not associated with a lower risk of unplanned hospital readmission within 3 months of discharge. However , the wide 95 % confidence intervals indicate that the evidence is not robust. CRD42017058592.
