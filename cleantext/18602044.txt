  Laparoscopic procedures to treat endometrial cancer are currently emerging. At present , we have evidence to do laparoscopic oncologic resections for endometrial cancer as proven by many prospective studies from abroad such as LAP2 by GOG. So , we have decided to assess the safety and feasibility of such a study in our population with the following as our primary objectives: ( 1) to study whether laparoscopy is better compared to open approach in terms of duration of hospital stay , perioperative morbidity and early recovery from surgical trauma and ( 2) to study whether the laparoscopic approach is noninferior to the open approach in terms of number of lymph nodes harvested in lymphadenectomy and rate of conversion to open surgery. We did a prospective nonrandomized comparative study of open versus laparoscopy approach for surgical staging of endometrial cancer from 16th May 2013 to 15th May 2015. To prove a significant difference in the hospital stay , we needed 29 patients in each arm. Thirty patients in each arm were enrolled for the study. The median duration of stay in the open arm was 7 days and in the laparoscopy arm it was 5 days. The advantage of 2 days in the laparoscopic arm was statistically significant (
