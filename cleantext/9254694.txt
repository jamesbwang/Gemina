  Cryptochromes , a class of blue light photoreceptors , play vital roles in regulating growth and development in higher plants. Despite their control over various important traits , there have been few studies focusing on cryptochromes in forest<disease> trees to date. In this study , the Euphrates poplar ( Populus euphratica) gene PeCRY1 ( cryptochrome 1 of Populus euphratica) was isolated and heterologously expressed in Populus tomentosa. Three biological replicates of each of the PeCRY1 transgenic P. tomentosa ( CRY1) and wild-type ( WT) plants were processed for transcriptome profiling. We found 34792 commonly expressed transcripts among the 93868 detected unigenes. Using R package DESeq , we identified 357 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) , including 132 upregulated and 225 downregulated genes. Gene ontology ( GO) enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment were used to better understand the functions of detected DEGs. Biosynthetic processes , such as starch and sucrose metabolism , which are closely related to growth and development , were highly enriched. Organic cyclic compound biosynthesis was downregulated , whereas carbohydrate metabolism was upregulated. Through KEGG pathway enrichment , we observed that the pentose phosphate pathway , photosynthesis , and circadian rhythm were significantly enriched. Another method of expression analysis based on quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) validated our RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq) results.
