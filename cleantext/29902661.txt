  Herbal medicines have been increasingly used in the last three decades. Despite their popularity , safety issues with herbal products need to be addressed. We performed a feasibility study of the toxic responses of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes ( iHep cells) to phytochemicals in comparison with hepatoblasoma-derived HepG2 cells and long-term human hepatocytes ( LTHHs). The iHep cells expressed typical hepatocyte markers cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4) , hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α , and albumin despite the expression of immature markers α-fetoprotein and cytokeratin 19. We studied the responses of iHep cells to phytochemicals saikosaponin D , triptolide , deoxycalyciphylline B , and monocrotaline with different mode of toxicity employing MTS and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) assays. Saikosaponin D and triptolide caused dose-dependent cytotoxicity in the iHep cells , which were more sensitive than LTHHs and HepG2 cells. Saikosaponin D-induced cytotoxicity tightly correlated with increased LDH leakage in the iHep cells. Although deoxycalyciphylline B did not exhibit toxic effect on the iHep and HepG2 cells when compared with LTHHs , it decreased CYP3A7 expression in the iHep cells and increased CYP1A2 expression in HepG2 cells. We hereby show the feasibility of using iHep cells to detect toxic effects of phytochemicals.
