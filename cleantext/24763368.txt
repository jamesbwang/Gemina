  Many petroleum-polluted areas are considered as extreme environments because of co-occurrence of low and high temperatures , high salt , and acidic and anaerobic conditions. Alkanes , which are major constituents of crude oils , can be degraded under extreme conditions , both aerobically and anaerobically by bacteria and archaea of different phyla. Alkane degraders possess exclusive metabolic pathways and survival strategies , which involve the use of protein and RNA chaperones , compatible solutes , biosurfactants , and exopolysaccharide production for self-protection during harsh environmental conditions such as oxidative and osmotic stress , and ionic nutrient-shortage. Recent findings suggest that the thermophilic sulfate-reducing archaeon
