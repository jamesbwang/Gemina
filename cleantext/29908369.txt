  Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT) has been shown to induce left ventricular reverse remodeling , but little is known about its influence on ventricular repolarization. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in ventricular repolarization of native conduction after CRT and its relation to ventricular tachycardia<symptom> ( VT) and ventricular fibrillation ( VF) during long-term follow-up. We prospectively included 64 patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> treated with CRT. QT interval , TpTe , and TpTe/QT ratio were analyzed from 20-minute high-resolution ECGs that were recorded at baseline and 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months after CRT implantation. CRT was temporary inhibited during follow-up to record intrinsic ECG. Patients with a decrease of left ventricular end-systolic volume â‰¥ 15 % at 12-month follow-up ( mid-term follow-up) were considered as responders. Occurrences of VT/VF during follow-up were noted. Significant increase of repolarization heterogeneity in the first months after implantation was observed ( P < .05) but then declined during 12 months of follow-up. Patients with VT/VF during long-term follow-up had higher repolarization heterogeneity at mid-term follow-up than patients without VT/VF ( TpTe/QT ratio: 0.263 ( 0.204-0.278) vs 0.225 ( 0.204-0.239); P = .045). Echocardiographic response at mid-term follow-up did not significantly influence the rate of VT/VF ( log-rank P = .252). In multivariate Cox regression analysis , only high repolarization heterogeneity at mid-term follow-up ( TpTe/QT ratio > 0.260) was independently associated with high risk of VT/VF ( hazard ratio 4.29; 95 % confidence interval 1.40-13.15; P = .011). CRT induces time-dependent changes in repolarization parameters in the first year after implantation. High repolarization heterogeneity at mid-term follow-up was associated with higher rate of VT/VF during long-term follow-up.
