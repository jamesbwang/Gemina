  Seaweed polysaccharides have been widely used as viscosifier , gelling agents , and stabilizer in the various application fields , e.g. , food , pharmaceutical , nutraceutical , and chemical industries. Applications of seaweed polysaccharides are further expanding to versatile directions , e.g. , biofuels , bioactive compounds , and functional materials for medical and basic researches. Production of functional oligo- and monosaccharides by the use of specific enzymes is also expected to improve the value of seaweed polysaccharides. The enzymes that depolymerize seaweed polysaccharides are distributed largely among seaweed-associating organisms like marine invertebrates and bacteria. Among them , herbivorous marine gastropods such as abalone and sea hare<pathogen> are the most prominent producers of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. To date , various kinds of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes have been isolated from the digestive fluid and hepatopancreas of these animals. Among them , alginate lyase , Î²-1,3-glucanase , mannanase , and cellulase are the major constituents of their digestive fluid. In this chapter , the authors describe the general methods for the preparation and activity assay of the gastropod polysaccharide-degrading enzymes and provide basic knowledge for their primary structures.
