  Bone-implant-associated infections are common after orthopedic surgery due to impaired host immune response around the implants. In particular , when a biofilm develops , the immune system and antibiotic treatment find it difficult to eradicate , which sometimes requires a second operation to replace the infected implants. Most strategies have been designed to prevent biofilms from forming on the surface of bone implants , but these strategies can not eliminate the biofilm when it has been established in vivo. To address this issue , a nonsurgical , noninvasive treatment for biofilm infection must be developed. Herein , a red-phosphorus-IR780-arginine-glycine-aspartic-acid-cysteine coating on titanium bone implants is prepared. The red phosphorus has great biocompatibility and exhibits efficient photothermal ability. The temperature sensitivity of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> biofilm is enhanced in the presence of singlet oxygen (
