  In this report , ternary titanium dioxide ( TiO ₂)/ carbon nanotubes ( CNTs)/ reduced graphene oxide ( rGO) composites were fabricated by a facile and environmentally friendly one-pot solvethermal method for the removal of Rhodamine B ( RhB). Its structures were represented by X-ray powder diffraction ( XRD) , Raman spectrometry , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM). The photocatalytic performance was tested by the degradation efficiency of RhB under UV-vis light irradiation. The experimental results indicated that photocatalytic activity improved as the ratio of CNTs: TiO ₂ ranged from 0.5 % to 3 % but reduced when the content increased to 5 % and 10 % , and the TiO ₂/ CNTs/rGO -3 % composites showed superior photocatalytic activity compared with the binary ones ( i.e. , TiO ₂/ CNTs , TiO ₂/ rGO) and pristine TiO ₂.
