  The optimal therapeutic strategy for potentially resectable clinical ( c-) stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) remains controversial. This phase II multi-institutional study ( WJOG5308L) was designed to evaluate the feasibility of induction chemotherapy with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy ( 50 Gy) followed by surgery and postoperative consolidation chemotherapy in IIIA-N2 NSCLC. Patients with resectable c-stage IIIA-N2 were eligible , and pathological confirmation of N2 disease was mandatory. Patients received chemotherapy consisting of weekly carboplatin plus paclitaxel with concurrent radiotherapy ( 50 Gy in 25 fractions). Unless disease progression , patients underwent surgical resection , and thereafter received two courses of consolidation chemotherapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved complete resection after induction chemo-radiotherapy ( R0 rate). From December 2011 to November 2013 , 40 eligible patients were enrolled. All patients completed induction chemo-radiotherapy with an overall response rate of 58 % , and 32 patients achieved complete resection ( R0 rate , 80 %) mostly with lobectomy ( N = 27). Twenty patients ( 50 %) completed the study treatment including postoperative chemotherapy. After the median follow-up period of 38 months , the progression-free survival , overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates at 2 years were 63 % , 75 % , and 62 % , respectively. The 30-day and 90-day mortality were 0 %. Induction chemotherapy with concurrent radiotherapy ( 50 Gy) followed by surgery was a feasible and promising treatment option for resectable c-stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC.
