  In this study , we aimed to examine the association of demographic and socioeconomic factors with cutaneous melanoma that required admission. A cross-sectional study utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database , 2003-2009 , was merged with County Health Rankings Data. A total of 2,765 discharge- records were included. Men were more likely to have melanoma in the head , neck , and trunk regions ( p < 0.001) , while extremities melanoma was more common in women ( p < 0.001). Males had a higher risk of lymph node metastasis on presentation ( OR 1.54 , 95 % CI ( 1.27-1.89)). Blacks and Hispanics were more likely to present with extremities melanoma. Patients with low annual income were more likely to be treated by low-volume surgeons and in hospitals located in high-risk communities ( p < 0.05 each). Patients with Medicaid coverage were twice as likely to present with distant metastasis and were more likely to be managed by low-volume surgeons ( p < 0.05 each). The presentation and outcomes of cutaneous melanoma have a distinct pattern of distribution based on patients ' characteristics.
