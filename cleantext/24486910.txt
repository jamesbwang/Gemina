  Notochordal cell derived matrix ( NCM) can induce regenerative effects on nucleus pulposus cells and may exert such effects on chondrocytes as well. Furthermore , when dissolved at low concentrations , NCM forms a viscous fluid with potential lubricating properties. Therefore , this study tests the feasibility of the use of NCM as a regenerative lubricant for the osteoarthritic joint. Chondrocyte-seeded alginate beads were cultured in base medium ( BM) , BM with NCM ( NCM) , or BM with TGF-β1 ( TGF) , as well as BM and NCM treated with IL-1β. NCM increased GAG deposition and cell proliferation ( stronger than TGF) , and GAG/DNA ratio and hydroxyproline content ( similar to TGF). These effects were maintained in the presence of IL-1β. Moreover , NCM mitigated expression of IL-1β-induced IL-6 , IL-8 , ADAMTS-5 and MMP-13. Reciprocating sliding friction tests of cartilage on glass were performed to test NCM 's lubricating properties relative to hyaluronic acid ( HA) , and showed a dose-dependent reduction in coefficient of friction with NCM , similar to HA. NCM has anabolic and anti-inflammatory effects on chondrocytes , as well as lubricating properties. Therefore , intra-articular NCM injection may have potential as a treatment to minimize pain while restoring the affected cartilage tissue in the osteoarthritic joint.
