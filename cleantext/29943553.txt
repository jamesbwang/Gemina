  Oxidoreductases are effective biocatalysts , but their practical use is limited by the need for large quantities of NAD ( P) H. In this study , a whole-cell biocatalyst for NAD ( P) H cofactor regeneration was developed using the economical substrate glycerol. This cofactor regeneration system employs permeabilized
