  The purpose of this study is to develop a Portuguese version of the Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP-14) and validate it for people with mild intellectual disability ( OHIP-14-MID-PT). The Portuguese version of the questionnaire was drawn up from the original English version , following internationally defined guidelines. Interviews were conducted with 240 individuals living in ( or attending) institutions of the central region of Portugal that are affiliated with Humanitas -LRB- Portuguese Federation for Intellectual Disability) to measure oral health related quality of life ( OHRQoL). The interview also included a sociodemographic and oral health questionnaire followed by an intraoral examination. Two types of reliability were analyzed: test-retest ( ICC) and internal consistency ( Cronbach 's α , inter-item and item-total correlations). Convergent and divergent validities were also assessed , and a confirmatory factor analysis was performed using the maximum likelihood method. The OHIP-14-MID-PT presented high reliability ( ICC = 0.999; Cronbach 's α = 0.922). The inter-item correlation coefficient ranged from 0.277 to 0.749 , and the item-total correlation coefficient varied between 0.529 and 0.718. Lower OHIP-14-MID-PT total scores were significantly associated with: a self-perception of better oral health status ( r = -0.545 , p < 0,001) and reduced need for dental treatment ( U = 2366.5 , p < 0,001) , more natural teeth ( χ2 = 29.74 , p < 0,001) and better results in the clinical oral health index ( COHI) ( χ 2 = 18.50 , p < 0,001); the results support the convergent and divergent validities of the questionnaire. OHIP-14-MID-PT has proved to be a consistent , valid and reliable instrument with good psychometric properties to determine the impact of oral health on quality of life in adults with mild intellectual disabilities in Portugal.
