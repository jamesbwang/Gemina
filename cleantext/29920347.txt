  The aims of this study were to estimate the histological and optical changes of early carious lesions<symptom> according to the duration of demineralization and to compare the efficacy to detect early carious lesions<symptom> of a quantitative light-induced fluorescence ( QLF) system with a spectrophotometer according to the lesion<symptom> depth. Eighty-four bovine enamel specimens were immersed in demineralizing gel for six distinct days. The severities of lesions<symptom> were evaluated by lesion<symptom> depths ( Ld) by polarized light microscopy , fluorescence loss ( ΔF) using QLF , and brightness ( ΔL Ld tended to be significantly deeper according to the demineralizing period ( p < 0.05). The ΔF significantly decreased ( p < 0.05) and the ΔL
