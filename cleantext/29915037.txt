  Insulin increases glucose uptake into adipose tissue and muscle by increasing trafficking of the glucose transporter Glut4. In cultured adipocytes , the exocytosis of Glut4 relies on activation of the small G protein RalA by insulin , via inhibition of its GTPase activating complex RalGAP. Here , we evaluate the role of RalA in glucose uptake in vivo with specific chemical inhibitors and by generation of mice with adipocyte-specific knockout of RalGAPB. RalA was profoundly activated in brown adipose tissue after feeding , and its inhibition prevented Glut4 exocytosis. RalGAPB knockout mice with diet-induced obesity were protected from the development of metabolic disease due to increased glucose uptake into brown fat. Thus , RalA plays a crucial role in glucose transport in adipose tissue in vivo.
