  There is strong evidence that obesity has deleterious effects on cognitive function of older adults. Previous preclinical studies demonstrate that obesity in aging is associated with a heightened state of systemic inflammation<symptom> , which exacerbates blood brain barrier disruption , promoting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. To test the hypothesis that synergistic effects of obesity and aging on inflammatory processes exert deleterious effects on hippocampal function , young and aged C57BL/6 mice were rendered obese by chronic feeding of a high fat diet followed by assessment of learning and memory function , measurement of hippocampal long-term potentiation ( LTP) , assessment of changes in hippocampal expression of genes relevant for synaptic function and determination of synaptic density. Because there is increasing evidence that altered<symptom> production<symptom> of lipid mediators modulate LTP , neuroinflammation and neurovascular coupling responses , the effects of obesity on hippocampal levels of relevant eicosanoid mediators were also assessed. We found that aging exacerbates obesity-induced microglia activation , which is associated with deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tests , impaired LTP , decreased synaptic density and dysregulation of genes involved in regulation of synaptic plasticity. Obesity in aging also resulted in an altered hippocampal eicosanoid profile , including decreases in vasodilator and pro-LTP epoxy-eicosatrienoic acids ( EETs). Collectively , our results taken together with previous findings suggest that obesity in aging promotes hippocampal inflammation<symptom> , which in turn may contribute to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment.
