  Myo-inositol hexaphosphate ( phytate; IP6) is a natural compound that is abundant in cereals , legumes , and nuts and it has the ability to chelate metal cations. The binding of IP6 to transition metals suggests that it could be used for the treatment of metal-catalyzed protein glycation , which appears to trigger diabetes-related diseases. Our in vitro studies showed that IP6 reduced the formation of Fe
