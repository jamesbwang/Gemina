  Over the past decade , a number of advanced magnetic resonance-based methods have been brought to bear on questions related to early development of the human cerebral cortex. Herein , we describe studies employing analysis of cortical surface folding ( cortical cartography) , cortical microstructure ( diffusion anisotropy) , and cortically-based functional networks ( resting state-functional connectivity MRI). The fundamentals of each MR method are described , followed by a discussion of application of the method to developing cortex and potential clinical uses. We use premature birth as an exemplar of how these modalities can be used to investigate the effects of medical and environmental variables on early cortical development.
