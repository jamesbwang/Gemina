  Grapevine is one of the most widely grown fruit crops in the world. At present , however , there is much concern regarding chemical pollution in viticulture due to the application of chemical fungicides and fertilizers. One viticultural practice to resolve this issue is the application of micro-organisms to grapevine as a substitute for chemicals. Some micro-organisms act as an enhancer of grape berry quality as well as a suppresser of disease in grapevine through their antagonistic ability and/or systemic resistance inducing ability. Herein , we review current and prospective applications of micro-organisms in viticulture. In this review , we evaluate the applicability of micro-organisms in viticulture. Micro-organisms can improve grape berry quality through grapevine disease protection and grape berry quality alteration. Because the use of micro-organisms to protect grapevine from plant diseases is safer than the use of chemical fungicides , the use of biofungicides in viticulture is expected to be enhanced by the increasing consumer concern towards chemical fungicides. Micro-organisms also modify plant secondary metabolites for use as flavours , pharmaceuticals and food additives. Studies of micro-organisms that promote polyphenol , anthocyanin and aroma compound biosynthesis are in progress with an eye to improving grape berry quality.
