  Nonenolide ( 1) was first isolated from the entomopathogenic fungus Cordyceps<pathogen> militaries BCC2816 and exhibited good antimalarial activity against Plasmodium<pathogen> falciparum<pathogen> K1. Structurally , it features a decanolide with a trans-double bond attached to two chiral hydroxy groups , making the total synthesis of the exclusive isomer of 1 more difficult. Herein , we report the successful synthesis of 1 by employing a MacMillan Î±-hydroxylation to generate three chiral centers in both the key fragments , starting from 1,6-hexanediol and 1,4-butanediol , followed by Steglich esterification of compounds 2 and 3. The exclusive E-isomer was obtained via a ring-closing metathesis of the mono-PMB-protected diene 19. Deprotection provided the required natural product 1.
