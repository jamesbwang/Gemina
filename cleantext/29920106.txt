  A Rh ( III)- catalyzed enaminone-directed alkenyl C-H coupling with alkynes for the synthesis of salicylaldehyde derivatives is reported. This represents a unique example of benzene ring framework formation through a transition-metal-catalyzed , directed C-H activation strategy. The two incorporated reactive functionalities , aldehyde and hydroxy groups , provide convenient synthetic handles for further structural elaboration.
