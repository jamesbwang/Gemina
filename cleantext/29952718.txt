  This study examined the role of dispositional mindfulness in impacting the relational benefits of yoga in novice practitioners in an undergraduate academic yoga course. 21 college students enrolled in a yoga course throughout a 15-week academic semester ( January- April 2016). Participants attended lab assessments at the beginning and end of the semester and were asked to complete eight consecutive Internet-based daily surveys across six separate bursts , yielding 48 data points for each participant. Multivariate time-series analyses revealed within-person subgroup differences such that in general , those in the high trait mindfulness group gleaned benefits from yoga practice with respect to relational outcomes. This study demonstrated trait mindfulness impacts relational outcomes in novice yoga practitioners , suggesting those low in trait mindfulness may not garner immediate relational benefits from yoga and could benefit from additional strategies to bolster against any negative influences of initiating yoga practice.
