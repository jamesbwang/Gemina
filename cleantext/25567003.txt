  This study evaluates a novel technique of laparoscopic ovarian transposition performed by Gynecologic Oncologists prior to pelvic radiation for gynecologic cancer. A retrospective review was completed of all patients that underwent laparoscopic ovarian transposition from February 2007 to June 2017 at one tertiary care cancer. The technique involves salpingectomy , followed by retroperitoneal dissection to move the ovaries lateral to the hepatic and splenic flexures of the colon. Normal ovarian function was defined by the absence of vasomotor symptoms , FSH and menstrual history ( if menstruating). The radiation dose to the ovary was calculated through dose volume histograms from three-dimensional image planning. Ten patients had laparoscopic ovarian transposition , of which , eight patients received post-operative external beam radiation to the pelvis ( 45-59.4 Gy). Four had additional brachytherapy ( 35.5-40 Gy). Median age and follow up were 29 years ( 18-37) , and 20 months ( 6-103). Nine patients had cervical and one had vaginal cancer. Four patients were treated with primary radiation , three had radical trachelectomy with adjuvant radiation , and three had radical hysterectomy with one of three receiving adjuvant radiation. No patients developed vasomotor symptoms ( 0/8 ( 95 % CI 0-19 %)). FSH was normal in 2/2 patients. Menses continued post-radiation in 5/7 women who retained their uterus. The median radiation dose to the right and left ovary was 0.51 ( 0.23-1.1) Gy and 0.53 ( 0.23-1.1) Gy , respectively. Laparoscopic ovarian transposition with mobilization to the hepatic and splenic flexures of the colon achieves preservation of ovarian function in women prior to pelvic radiation.
