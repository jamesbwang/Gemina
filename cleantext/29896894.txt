  Targeted gene flow is an emerging conservation strategy. It involves translocating individuals with favorable genes to areas where they will have a conservation benefit. The applications for targeted gene flow are wide-ranging , but include pre-adapting natives to the arrival of invasive species. The endangered carnivorous marsupial , the northern quoll , has declined rapidly since the introduction of the cane toad , which fatally poisons quolls that attack them. There are , however , a few remaining toad-invaded quoll populations in which the quolls survive because they know not to eat cane toads. It is this `` toad-smart '' behavior that we hope to promote through targeted gene flow. For targeted gene flow to be feasible , however , toad-smarts must have a genetic basis. To assess this , we used a common garden experiment and found offspring from toad-exposed populations were substantially less likely to eat toads than those with toad-na√Øve parents. Hybrid offspring showed similar responses to quolls with two toad-exposed parents , indicating the trait may be dominant. Together , these results suggest a heritable trait and rapid adaptive response in small number of toad-impacted populations. Although questions remain about outbreeding depression<symptom> , our results are encouraging for targeted gene flow: suggesting it should be possible to introduce toad-smart behavior into soon to be impacted quoll populations.
