  The aim of this mixed treatment comparison ( MTC) meta-analysis was to determine glucagon like peptide-1 ( GLP-1) receptor agonists ' effects on cardiovascular ( CV) outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM). A comprehensive , systematic review was conducted using EMBASE and Medline databases. All included trials were large CV outcome trials of GLP-1 agonists versus placebo in T2DM. The primary outcomes of this MTC meta-analysis were death from CV causes , non-fatal MI , and non-fatal stroke. Hospitalisation for heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) was evaluated as a secondary endpoint. A total of four trials , including 33,457 patients , met eligibility criteria and were retained for the meta-analysis. Our pairwise meta-analysis results showed a 13 % reduction in death from cardiovascular causes in patients who received GLP-1 agonists versus placebo ( RR 0.87 , 95 % CI: 0.78-0.96). However , no statistically significant reduction was observed with GLP-1 agonists in terms of reducing non-fatal MI ( RR 0.95 , 95 % CI: 0.86-1.04) , non-fatal stroke events ( RR 0.89 , 95 % CI: 0.76-1.03) , and rates of HF hospitalisation ( RR 0.94 , 95 % CI: 0.84-1.04). The network meta-analysis ( NMA) showed no significant differences among all the interventions. Glucagon like peptide-1 therapy was associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular ( CV) death. However , GLP-1 agonists seem to have a safety profile comparable to placebo in terms of reducing non-fatal myocardial infarction ( MI) , non-fatal stroke events , and rates of HF hospitalisation.
