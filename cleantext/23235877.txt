  Thermally activated delayed florescence ( TADF) materials can be an efficient host in organic LED ( OLED). It is because it is possible to couple energetically the emission energy level of a dopant to the energy levels in the TADF material. In this work fluorescent emitters 2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1,1,7,7 ,- tetramethyl-1H ,5 H,11H-10- ( 2-benzothiazolyl) quinolizino-9,9 a ,1 gh coumarin ( c545t) and 5,6,11,12-tetraphenyltetracene ( rubrene) were used as dopants in a blended TADF host; tris ( 4-carbazoyl-9-ylphenyl) amine ( TCTA) with 2,4,6-tris ( 3 '- ( pyridin-3-yl) biphenyl-3-yl) -1,3,5-triazine ( Tm3PyBPZ). The blended TADF host has an energy difference between the singlet and triplet excited states ( Î”E
