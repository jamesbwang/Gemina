  Nearly 50 years ago , catheter angiography was introduced as a means of both diagnosing and treating nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Technological advances and innovations have resulted in the introduction of microcatheters that , using a coaxial technique , are capable of selecting third-order arterial branches and of delivering a wide array of embolic agents. This article reviews the imaging diagnosis of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding , the techniques of diagnostic and therapeutic angiography , the angiographic appearance of the various etiologies of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding , the rationale behind case-specific selection of embolic agents as well as the anticipated outcome of transcatheter arterial embolization.
