  Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles ( EVs) are believed to be cardioprotective in myocardial infarct. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of human mesenchymal cell-derived EV injection on cardiac function , myocardial blood flow , and vessel density in the setting of chronic myocardial ischemia. Twenty-three Yorkshire swine underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor on their left circumflex artery. Two weeks later , the animals were split into 2 groups: the control group ( CON; n = 7) and the EV myocardial injection group ( MVM; n = 10). The MVM group underwent myocardial injection of 50 Î¼g of EVs in 2 mL 0.9 % saline into the ischemic myocardium. Five weeks later , the pigs underwent a harvest procedure , and the left ventricular myocardium was analyzed. Absolute blood flow and the ischemic/nonischemic myocardial perfusion ratio were increased in the ischemic myocardium in the MVM group compared with the CON group. Pigs in the MVM group had increased capillary and arteriolar density in the ischemic myocardial tissue compared with CON pigs. There was an increase in expression of the phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase ratio , the phospho-endothelial nitric oxide synthase/endothelial nitric oxide synthase ratio , and total protein kinase B in the MVM group compared with CON. There was an increase in cardiac output and stroke volume in the MVM group compared with CON. In the setting of chronic myocardial ischemia , myocardial injection of human mesenchymal cell-derived EVs increases blood flow to ischemic myocardial tissue by induction of capillary and arteriolar growth via activation of the protein kinase B/endothelial nitric oxide synthase and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways resulting in increased cardiac output and stroke volume.
