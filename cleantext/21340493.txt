  Given the recent emphasis on the totality of the diet by national guidelines , we examined the relationship between the quality of diet and overall and cancer-specific mortality among cancer survivors. From the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III) , 1191 participants diagnosed with cancer were identified. Healthy Eating Index ( HEI) scores were utilized; higher HEI score indicated better adherence to dietary recommendations. During a median follow-up of 17.2 years , a total of 607 cancer-specific deaths occurred. A high-quality diet ( highest-quartile HEI score) was associated with decreased risk of overall ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 0.59 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.45 to 0.77) and cancer-specific ( HR = 0.35 , 95 % CI = 0.19 to 0.63) mortality when compared with a poor-quality diet ( lowest-quartile HEI score). Among individual dietary components , the highest-quartile score for saturated fat intake was associated decreased cancer-specific mortality ( HR = 0.55 , 95 % CI = 0.36 to 0.86). Our results highlight the importance of a `` total diet '' approach to improving survival among cancer patients.
