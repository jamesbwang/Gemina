  Chemoinformatic methods , such as multivariable explorative techniques and quantitative structure-activity relationship ( QSAR) modeling , allow for discovering relationships between the activity and the structure of chemical compounds. These techniques can be applied , as preliminary screening methods for designing and/or selecting new compounds with defined activity.Here we describe step by step how to preliminarily screen ionic liquids ( a set of 13 ILs) and assess their cytotoxic activity against leukemia<disease> cell line IPC-81 as well as ILs ' potential to inhibit acetylcholinesterase enzyme using the TRIC method ( toxicity ranking index of cations) combined with the QSAR approach.
