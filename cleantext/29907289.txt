  In order to suppress or eliminate the spurious peaks and improve signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR) of Hadamard transform ion mobility spectrometry ( HT-IMS) , a normal-inverse bimodule operation Hadamard transform- ion mobility spectrometry ( NIBOHT-IMS) technique was developed. In this novel technique , a normal and inverse pseudo random binary sequence ( PRBS) was produced in sequential order by an ion gate controller and utilized to control the ion gate of IMS , and then the normal HT-IMS mobility spectrum and the inverse HT-IMS mobility spectrum were obtained. A NIBOHT-IMS mobility spectrum was gained by subtracting the inverse HT-IMS mobility spectrum from normal HT-IMS mobility spectrum. Experimental results demonstrate that the NIBOHT-IMS technique can significantly suppress or eliminate the spurious peaks , and enhance the SNR by measuring the reactant ions. Furthermore , the gas CHCl
