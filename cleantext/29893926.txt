  We aimed to investigate gender differences in disease manifestations , patient-reported outcomes , comorbidities and treatment effectiveness among patients with PsA treated with their first TNFÎ± inhibitor ( TNFI). In this observational cohort study , the DANBIO register provided prospectively collected data on PsA patients who initiated their first TNFI in 2000-15. Comorbidity information was achieved from the Danish Nationwide Patient Register. Response to treatment was assessed according to EULAR and ACR criteria at 3 and 6 months. Cox and logistic regression models analysed the impact of gender on TNFI persistence and response , respectively , while adjusting for a priori selected confounders including clinical- , laboratory- and patient-reported factors , comorbidities and lifestyle characteristics. A total of 1750 PsA patients ( 935 women) were included. At baseline , women were older ( 49 years/47 years) , more often smokers ( 32 %/ 26 %) , had worse patient-reported scores ( e.g. global score 71 mm/65 mm) and higher frequencies of hospital-diagnosed anxiety<symptom> or depression<symptom> ( 7 %/ 4 %) and chronic pulmonary disease ( 7 %/ 3 %) than men ( all P < 0.01). Median TNFI persistence was 3.8 years ( 95 % CI: 3.0 , 5.7) in men vs 1.4 ( 1.1 , 1.8) in women ( P < 0.001). Men had higher odds of achieving response after 3 and 6 months , for example , adjusted odds ratio = 3.2 ( 1.6 , 6.1) for EULAR good/moderate response ( vs women) at 6 months. Male gender was strongly associated with greater TNFI treatment effectiveness. Adjustment for baseline risk factors including patient-reported outcomes , disease activity , comorbidities and lifestyle factors did not influence this relationship , which suggests a role of biological factors.
