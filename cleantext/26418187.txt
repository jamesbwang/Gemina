  Remarkable attention has been committed to the recently discovered cost effective and solution processable lead-free organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells. Recent studies have reported that , within five years , the reported efficiency has reached 9.0 % , which makes them an extremely promising and fast developing candidate to compete with conventional lead-based perovskite solar cells. The major challenge associated with the conventional perovskite solar cells is the toxic nature of lead ( Pb) used in the active layer of perovskite material. If lead continues to be used in fabricating solar cells , negative health impacts will result in the environment due to the toxicity of lead. Alternatively , lead free perovskite solar cells could give a safe way by substituting low-cost , abundant and non toxic material. This review focuses on formability of lead-free organic-inorganic halide perovskite , alternative metal cations candidates to replace lead ( Pb) , and possible substitutions of organic cations , as well as halide anions in the lead-free organic-inorganic halide perovskite architecture. Furthermore , the review gives highlights on the impact of organic cations , metal cations and inorganic anions on stability and the overall performance of lead free perovskite solar cells.
