  The present study aims at evaluating the correlation between the free radical formation and the healing action of lower limbs ' ulcers<pathogen> in a randomized controlled trial with the use of an adhesive derived from natural latex associated with a light-emitting diode ( LED) circuit. The sample consists of 15 participants with lower limb<pathogen> lesions<pathogen> divided into three groups: group 1 case ( 5 participants) received the proposed dressing system adhesive of the natural latex associated with the LED circuit; group 2 control ( 5 participants) received the dressings at home performed by nurses according to and established by the clinic of wounds<pathogen> ( treated with calcium alginate or silver foam); and group 3 ( 5 participants) also received the dressing in their homes with the use of the dressing adhesive derived from the natural latex associated with the LED circuit. The collected data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by electron paramagnetic resonance for determination of free radical formation. Kruskal-Wallis statistical test was used to evaluate the effect of treatment on the lower limb 's ulcer<pathogen> cicatrization process and its correlation with free radical. The results obtained corroborated the hypothesis about the reduction of the quantity of these molecules in the end of treatment related to the healing
