  Although the frequency of surgical weight<symptom> loss<symptom> interventions has increased in Saudi Arabia , literature describing the clinical outcomes of bariatric surgery in Saudi Arabia is limited. This study aimed to assess whether weight<symptom> loss<symptom> intervention improves hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c) in obese patients and to identify its associated factors. A retrospective study was carried out on 318 patients with obesity class 1 or higher ( body mass index ( BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m The postoperative HbA1c was 5.83 ± 0.9 , while the baseline level was 6.74 ± 2.1 ( Being a diabetic patient was related to a significant reduction in HbA1c levels postoperatively. The study suggests that the reduction in HbA1c levels could be modified by BMI , wherein greater reduction in BMI leads to greater reduction in HbA1c levels.
