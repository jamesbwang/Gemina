  In this work , ZnO nanoparticles-reduced graphene oxide ( rGO) composites were fabricated via a novel one-step photochemical method. The developed nanocomposite offered high photodegradation efficiency of methylene blue ( MB) under UV and visible light. In the proposed route , the reduction of graphene oxide ( GO) and formation of ZnO nanoparticles occurred simultaneously , which results in high synthesis efficiency of ZnO/rGO nanocomposites. The electron microscopy confirmed that the ZnO nanoparticles were uniformly anchored on rGO sheets. The structure and quality of prepared nanocomposite were assessed by X-ray diffraction , Fourier transform infrared ( FT-IR) spectroscopy , Raman spectroscopy , and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS). Furthermore , the synthesis of the nanocomposite and degradation of MB , along with a mechanistic insight , is discussed in detail.
