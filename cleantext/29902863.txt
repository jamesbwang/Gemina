  Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer related death due to a poor prognosis. In this study , we investigated the effect of Gomisin G on colon cancer growth and examined the underlying mechanism of action. We found that Gomisin G significantly suppressed the viability and colony formation of LoVo cells. Gomisin G reduced the phosphorylation level of AKT implying that Gomisin G suppressed the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Gomisin G also induced apoptosis shown by Annexin V staining and an increased level of cleaved poly-ADP ribose polymerase ( PARP) and Caspase-3 proteins. Furthermore , Gomisin G remarkably triggered the accumulation of cells at the sub-G1 phase which represents apoptotic cells. In addition , the level of cyclin D1 and phosphorylated retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein ( Rb) was also reduced by the treatment with Gomisin G thus curtailing cell cycle progression. These findings show the suppressive effect of Gomisin G by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in LoVo cells. Taken together , these results suggest Gomisin G could be developed as a potential therapeutic compound against colon cancer.
