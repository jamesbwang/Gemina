  A potentially universal approach is presented for enzyme attachment to cellulose that significantly enhances enzyme stability while retaining high activity , and involves no chemical functionalization of cellulose. Bovine serum albumin ( BSA) was interlocked in cellulose to form a protein-friendly surface ( named BSA-Paper) , while also providing COOH and NH
