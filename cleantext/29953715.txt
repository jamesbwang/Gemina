  In epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition , epithelial cells lose their features , acquiring a mesenchymal-like phenotype. Nm23-H1 protein relates to tumor cells ' metastatic potential , its low expression in carcinomas often meaning a poor prognosis. This study newly investigated the role of nuclear nm23-H1 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Immunohistochemical analyses of nuclear nm23-H1 , E-cadherin , N-cadherin , Snail , Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox ( ZEB) 1 , and ZEB2 were performed in 33 consecutive patients with laryngeal SCC. Mean nuclear nm23-H1 expression was lower in patients whose disease recurred ( P = .0046). Disease-free survival ( DFS) was longer for patients whose nuclear nm23-H1 expression was ≥ 10 % ( P = .0083). Nuclear nm23-H1 and E-cadherin expressions correlated directly ( P = .018). Mean E-cadherin expression was lower in patients whose disease recurred ( P = .03). The DFS was shorter in patients with ZEB2 expression ≥ 5 % ( P = .006). Nuclear nm23-H1 expression warrants further investigation in laryngeal SCC as a prognostic marker identifying patients at higher risk of recurrence. nm23-H1 targeted treatments may be capable of regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
