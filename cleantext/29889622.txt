  Birth rates in the United States have recently fallen. Birth rates per 1000 females aged 25-29 fell from 118 in 2007 to 105 in 2015. One factor may involve the vaccination against the human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>). Shortly after the vaccine was licensed , several reports of recipients experiencing primary ovarian failure emerged. This study analyzed information gathered in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , which represented 8 million 25-to-29-year-old women residing in the United States between 2007 and 2014. Approximately 60 % of women who did not receive the HPV<pathogen> vaccine had been pregnant at least once , whereas only 35 % of women who were exposed to the vaccine had conceived. For married women , 75 % who did not receive the shot were found to conceive , while only 50 % who received the vaccine had ever been pregnant. Using logistic regression to analyze the data , the probability of having been pregnant was estimated for females who received an HPV<pathogen> vaccine compared with females who did not receive the shot. Results suggest that females who received the HPV<pathogen> shot were less likely to have ever been pregnant than women in the same age group who did not receive the shot. If 100 % of females in this study had received the HPV<pathogen> vaccine , data suggest the number of women having ever conceived would have fallen by 2 million. Further study into the influence of HPV<pathogen> vaccine on fertility is thus warranted.
