  Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy ( FNAB) allows the cytological differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid nodules<symptom>. However , the method itself is not adequate in determining some cases. For example , the diagnosis of Follicular Variant Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma ( FV-PTC) can be challenging. In the current study we investigate the protein profiles of FV-PTC and classical variant PTC ( CV-PTC) with no lymph node metastasis and compare it with benign thyroid tissue. We used CV-PTC ( n = 6) , FV-PTC ( n = 6) and benign thyroid tissues ( n = 6) to prepare tissue lysates. Proteins from each group were trypsin and lys-C digested. The samples were analyzed on a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. We identified 2560 proteins across all 18 specimens. Protein profiles revealed that there was no clear distinction between benign and FV-PTC samples. However , further examination of our data showed that proteins in energy metabolism have altered in FV-PTC. Proteomic pathway analysis showed marked alteration of the actin cytoskeleton proteins , especially several members of Arp2/3 complex were significantly increased in CV-PTC. We made the novel observation that IQGAP1 protein was significantly increased in CV-PTC , whereas IQGAP2 protein was highly expressed in FV-PTC lesions<symptom> , suggesting differential roles of IQGAP proteins in thyroid pathology. In the present study , mass spectrometry based label free quantification approach was applied to investigate the protein profiles of FV-PTC , CV-PTC and benign thyroid tissues. This study pointed out that actin cytoskeleton proteins , IQGAP proteins and changes in energy metabolism play predominant roles in thyroid pathology.
