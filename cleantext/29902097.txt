  Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes<disease> ( MDS) are at increased risk of iron overload due to ineffective erythropoiesis and chronic transfusion therapy. The clinical consequences of iron overload include cardiac and/or hepatic failure , endocrinopathies , and infection risk. Areas covered: Iron chelation therapy ( ICT) can help remove excess iron and ultimately reduce the clinical consequences of iron overload. The authors reviewed recent ( last five years) English-language articles from PubMed on the topic of iron overload-related complications and the use of ICT ( primarily deferasirox) to improve outcomes in patients with MDS. Expert commentary: While a benefit of ICT has been more firmly established in other transfusion-dependent conditions , such as thalassemia , its role in reducing iron overload in MDS remains controversial due to the lack of prospective controlled data demonstrating a survival benefit. Orally administered chelation agents ( e.g. deferasirox) are now available , and observational and/or retrospective data support a survival benefit of using ICT in MDS. The placebo-controlled TELESTO trial ( NCT00940602) is currently examining the use of deferasirox in MDS patients with iron overload , and is evaluating specifically whether use of ICT to alleviate iron overload can also reduce iron overload-related complications in MDS and improve survival.
