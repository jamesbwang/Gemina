  There are currently no standardized protocols for pre-analytical handling of urine to best preserve small RNA for miRNA profiling studies. miRNA is an attractive candidate as a potential biomarker because of the high level of stability in body fluids and its ability to be quantified on multiple high-throughput platforms. We present a comparison of small RNA recovery and stability in urine under alternate pre-analytical handling conditions and extend recommendations on what conditions optimize yield of miRNA from cell-free urine and urine extracellular vesicles ( EVs). Using an affinity slurry for isolation of small RNA from urine , we found that urine samples held at room temperature ( 20 °C) for up to 8 hours before processing yield the highest amounts of intact small RNAs from EVs. Some miRNA is lost from urine samples when held 2 °C to 4 °C and/or frozen before EV isolation , likely because of EV entrapment in uromodulin precipitates. However , we found that a simple 5-minute incubation of urine containing cold-induced precipitate at 37 °C resolubilizes much of this precipitate and results in an increased recovery of EVs and miRNAs. Finally , small RNA integrity can be compromised when whole urine is held at 37 °C for as little as 4 hours and is not conducive to efficient miRNA profiling.
