  Immune checkpoint inhibitors present clinicians with both an exciting step forward in cancer treatment and the unknown possibilities of an unshackled immune system. The latter phenomena , known as immune-related adverse events ( irAEs) , are of particular interest because they may affect any organ system with autoimmune-like pathologies , such as hepatitis<disease> and colitis<disease>. Within the cardiovascular system , irAEs associated with immune checkpoint blockade exist as a broad clinical spectrum , with autoimmune myocarditis<disease> being the best-characterized entity at this time. In general , irAEs are often reversible with immunosuppression. However , irAEs which affect the cardiovascular system pose the possibility of a rapid and fatal clinical deterioration. The mortality attributed to immune checkpoint blockade-associated autoimmune myocarditis<disease> , as reported in the WHO database , exists from 36-67 % , dependent on the therapeutic regimen. Yet , despite the potential severity such events pose , guidelines dictating the identification of immune checkpoint inhibition irAEs do not exist , providing a stark contrast with other anti-cancer medications with known cardiovascular effects. The lack of guidelines may be related to the perceived rarity of these events; yet a recent study of immune checkpoint inhibition-associated autoimmune myocarditis<disease> suggests this clinical entity may be more prevalent than initially believed. Until more standardized information regarding these potentially serious events is available , the study of documented cases is instructive to improve identification of such phenomena , as well as the outcomes for patients who develop them.
