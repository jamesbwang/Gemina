  Evidence about the optimal timing for total hip replacement ( THR) in HIV-positive patients is scant. Preoperative criteria: cluster of differentiation 4 ( CD4) counts > 200cells/mm We recruited 16 HIV-positive patients who had undergone 25 THRs between 2003 and 2015. None had hemophilia , and none were intravenous drug users ( IVDUs). Their mean age was 41.2 years ( range: 24-60); minimum follow-up was 12 months ( mean: 64.6); mean duration of prophylactic antibiotics was 2.9 days ( range: 1-5); and mean hospital length of stay was 6.0 days ( range: 4-11). No patients were treated with subsequent oral antibiotics. The mean preoperative CD4 count was 464.1 Â± 237.0 ( range: 235-904) cells/mm A preoperative CD4 count > 200cell/mm IV , retrospective or historical series.
