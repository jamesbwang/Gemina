  The success of genome-wide association studies ( GWAS) has significantly advanced our understanding of the etiology of coronary artery disease ( CAD) and opens new opportunities to reinvigorate the stalling CAD drug development. However , there exists remarkable disconnection between the CAD GWAS findings and commercialized drugs. While this could implicate major untapped translational and therapeutic potentials in CAD GWAS , it also brings forward extensive technical challenges. In this review we summarize the motivation to leverage GWAS for drug discovery , outline the critical bottlenecks in the field , and highlight several promising strategies such as functional genomics and network-based approaches to enhance the translational value of CAD GWAS findings in driving novel therapeutics.
