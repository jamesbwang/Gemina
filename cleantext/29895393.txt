  We have introduced an effective treatment for mandibular condylar osteochondroma with a digital cutting guide and endoscopically-assisted vertical ramus osteotomy ( VRO). Eleven patients with unilateral condylar osteochondroma , who did not require orthognathic surgery or had less than 3 mm deviation of the chin and a stable occlusion , were treated during the period April 2013-January 2017 with a digital cutting guide and endoscopically-assisted VRO. Clinical data collected included the occlusion , facial contour , and maximum mouth<symptom> opening ( MMO). Computed tomographic ( CT) scans were taken before and after operation. Two patients also had additional shaping of the mandibular contour. The pathological diagnosis was confirmed to be osteochondroma in all cases. A mean ( range) 19 ( 12-40) months of follow-up for all 11 cases showed stable postoperative occlusion and facial aesthetics. There were no functional disturbances , recurrence , or condylar absorption. VRO is an alternative to orthognathic surgery for patients with osteochondroma who do not have severe malocclusions. The digital cutting guide and endoscopically-assisted VRO make it possible to achieve precise resection of the tumour and maintain the occlusion with minimal invasion.
