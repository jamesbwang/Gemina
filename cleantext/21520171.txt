  Many tripartite motif ( TRIM) family proteins have been reported to be of great importance in the initiation and progression in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC). However , the biological role and regulatory mechanism of tripartite motif containing 52 ( TRIM52) in HCC development and progression are poorly defined. Immunohistochemistry ( IHC) , quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR) or Western blot analysis was used to detect TRIM52 , p21 , matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( MMP2) , protein phosphatase , Mg TRIM52 was significantly up-regulated in the HCC tissues in comparison with the adjacent non-tumor hepatic tissues. TRIM52 was also up-regulated in HCC cell lines ( MHCC-97H and MHCC-97L cells) compared with normal human liver cell line LO2. TRIM52 down-regulation by RNA interfering in MHCC-97H cells enhanced inhibition of cell proliferation , migration and invasion. TRIM52 down-regulation also induced MHCC-97H cells arrest in G0-G1 phase cell cycle and inhibited MHCC-97H cell growth in the nude mice. However , TRIM52 up-regulation in MHCC-97L cells promoted cell proliferation , migration and invasion. Furthermore , TRIM52 down-regulation significantly increased p21 and PPM1A expression , but inhibited MMP2 expression and induced Smad2/3 dephosphorylation in MHCC-97H cells , which were reversed by TRIM52 up-regulation in MHCC-97L cells. TRIM52 was found interacted with PPM1A and TRIM52 down-regulation inhibited the ubiquitination of PPM1A. Importantly , PPM1A up-regulation in MHCC-97L cells significantly suppressed TRIM52-mediated enhancement on cell proliferation , invasion and migration. Our findings suggest that TRIM52 up-regulation promotes proliferation , migration and invasion of HCC cells through the ubiquitination of PPM1A.
