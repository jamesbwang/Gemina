  Many scholars do not find evidence of a trickle-down effect from elite sport success to mass sport participation. Contrary to what is assumed by the trickle-down effect `` theorem '' , successful elite sportspeople do not seem to inspire amateurs to take up sport themselves. However , recent studies present evidence that elite sport can have an influence. In this article , we apply regression models on time series data from one of the most successful Danish sports , team handball. Our findings are mixed , but lean towards supporting scholars who argue that trickle-down effects are not necessarily an inherent part of international sporting success. Further studies should examine more sports to identify where trickle-down effects occur and why.
