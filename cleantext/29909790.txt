  Discontinuation of antipsychotics predisposes patients with remitted/stable first-episode psychosis ( FEP) to a higher risk of relapse , but it remains unclear how long discontinuation increases the relapse rate in these patients compared with maintenance. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) compared relapse rates in FEP patients between antipsychotic treatment discontinuation and maintenance groups at 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 ( primary) , and 18-24 months. The risk ratio ( RR) and numbers needed to treat/harm ( NNT/NNH) were calculated using a random-effects model. Ten RCTs were identified ( n = 776; mean study duration , 18.6 ± 6.0 months). The antipsychotics were discontinued abruptly in four RCTs ( which reported data only at 12 months) and after tapering off gradually over several months ( mean length , 3 months) in six RCTs. Compared with the discontinuation group , the maintenance group experienced significantly fewer relapses at all time points except 1 month ( RR ( NNT): 2 months , 0.49 ( 13); 3 months , 0.46 ( 9); 6 months , 0.55 ( 6); 9 months , 0.48 ( 3); 12 months , 0.47 ( 3); and 18-24 months , 0.57 ( 4)). The maintenance group was associated with higher discontinuation due to adverse events ( RR , 2.61; NNH , not significant). Maintaining antipsychotic treatment prevented relapse for up to 24 months in FEP patients. Discontinuation of antipsychotics for ⩾ 2 months significantly increased the risk of relapse. However , 45.7 % of patients who discontinued antipsychotics for 12 months ( 39.4 % after 18-24 months) did not experience a relapse.
