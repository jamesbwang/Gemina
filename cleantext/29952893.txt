  Because subcutaneously injected hyaluronic acid filler is absorbed over 6 months to 1 year after the treatment of facial wrinkles , frequent retreatment may be required. However , persistent long-term effects are often clinically observed when hyaluronic acid filler is injected as a bolus for facial augmentation. Therefore , the authors investigated , over time , the changes in volume and histologic features of subcutaneous bolus injections of hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid filler was subcutaneously injected as a bolus into the dorsum of 6-week-old rats. At several time points ( immediately after injection and 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , and 64 weeks thereafter) , magnetic resonance imaging was introduced to observe morphologic changes and to measure volume. Histologic examination of sectioned tissues was also performed. The average volume increased for up to 4 weeks after injection and then gradually decreased , with 74.8 percent of the injected volume remaining after 64 weeks , with no statistical difference compared to the initial volume. Histologic analysis revealed that lattice structures were created by fibroblasts and collagen fibers , and blood vessels and adipocytes were also generated in the filler. Although subcutaneous bolus injections of hyaluronic acid filler exhibited flattening , the total volume was maintained even after 64 weeks. Histologically , hyaluronic acid filler acted as a scaffold for autogenous tissue replacement by means of fibroblast migration and proliferation , collagen induction , and angiogenesis , followed by proliferation of adipocytes. This study demonstrates that the total volume is maintained long-term by replacing part of the injected hyaluronic acid filler with autologous tissues.
