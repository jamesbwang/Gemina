  Chironomids are often one of the dominant organisms in significantly polluted freshwater. Many invertebrate studies have characterized whole organism mechanisms of toxicity , for example , assessing cadmium ( Cd) uptake via calcium ( Ca) channels. However , with the use of the Scanning Ion-selective Electrode Technique ( SIET) and the use of an innovative Cd-selective microelectrode , we analyze this relationship at the organ level using a realistic concentration of Cd and Ca in the hemolymph ( blood). Generally , Cd fluxes follow the same directional pattern as Ca , although Ca fluxes are ∼ 5x higher than those of Cd. These results correlate well with previous studies indicating that chironomids have a higher affinity for Ca over Cd which affords them tolerance to Cd toxicity. When saline Ca concentration was increased to 10x physiological levels , Cd fluxes from the gut lumen into the cells of the midgut regions were reduced by 50-80 %. Transport of Cd from hemolymph to tissue for the posterior midgut , Malpighian tubule and proximal caeca was also reduced by ∼ 50 %. Our results indicate that Cd fluxes into or across the gut and Malpighian tubules are reduced by high Ca , suggesting that Cd may be transported in some cells by similar mechanisms. However , Cd was actively excreted at the anal papillae after a 48-h waterborne exposure to Cd , but this process was independent of Ca and instead may involve a P-glycoprotein-related pump to detoxify Cd.
