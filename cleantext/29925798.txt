  Fly ash and bentonite were mixed in a certain proportion as raw materials to prepare a denitration catalyst. In previous studies , it has been concluded that fly ash-type catalysts can provide significant catalytic activity for denitrification after being modified with oxygen. In this study , the effect of plasma conditions on the denitration performance of the catalyst was investigated from the aspects of plasma modification power , modification time , and the flow rate of the gas. Boehm titration and infrared analysis systems were used to characterize the performance of the catalyst. The experimental results show that the optimal modification power is 60 W , the optimal modification time is 20 min , and the optimal gas flow rate is 40 mL/min.
