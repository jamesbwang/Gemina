  The seafloor is recognized as one of the major sinks for microplastics ( MPs). However , to date there have been no studies reported the MP contamination in benthic organisms from the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. Therefore , this study provided the first data on the abundances and characteristics of MPs in a total of 413 dominant benthic organisms representing 11 different species inhabiting in the shelf of Bering and Chukchi Seas. The mean abundances of MP uptake by the benthos from all sites ranged from 0.02 to 0.46 items g
