  Flavobacterium columnare causes columnaris disease of farmed and wild freshwater fish. Skin mucus is an important factor in early stages of columnaris pathogenesis , albeit little studied. Our objectives were to ( a) characterize the terminal glycosylation pattern ( TGP) of catfish mucus , ( b) determine the growth of F. columnare in formulated water ( FW)- containing channel catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus) or hybrid catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus X Ictalurus furcatus) mucus and ( c) examine extracellular protease activity of two F. columnare isolates differing in virulence. The TGP of catfish mucus by lectin binding was as follows: alpha-D-mannose/alpha-D-glucose > N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine > N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine/ N-acetylneuraminic acid > N-acetyl-D-galactosamine > alpha-D-galactose/N-acetyl-alpha- D-galactosamine > beta-D-galactose = alpha-L-fucose. Virulence studies demonstrated isolate AL-02-36 was highly virulent in channel catfish fry ( 0.1 g) with cumulative mortality of 90 % -100 % versus 60 % for isolate ALG-00-530 at equivalent doses ( ~ 3 Ã— 10
