  The current study addressed whether two institution-wide interventions in St. Petersburg , Russian Federation , that increased caregiver sensitivity ( Training Only: TO) or both caregiver sensitivity and consistency ( Training plus Structural Changes: T+SC) promoted better socioemotional and cognitive development than did a No Intervention ( NoI) institution during the first year of life for children who were placed soon after birth. It also assessed whether having spent less than 9 versus 9 to 36 months with a family prior to institutionalization was related to children 's subsequent socioemotional and cognitive development within these three institutions. The Battelle Developmental Inventory ( J. Newborg , J.R. Stock , L. Wnek , J. Guidubaldi , & J. Svinicki , 1988) was used to assess the socioemotional and cognitive functioning of children in NoI ( n = 95) , TO ( n = 104) , and T+SC ( n = 86) at two to three time points during their first 6 to 12 months of residency. Results suggest that improving caregiver sensitivity can improve the cognitive development of infants in the first year of institutionalization whereas improving caregiver consistency in addition to sensitivity is more beneficial for socioemotional development than is sensitivity alone. Similarly , for children in T+SC , longer time with a family prior to institutionalization ( consistent caregiver , unknown sensitivity) was associated with better socioemotional , but not cognitive , baseline scores and more rapid cognitive than socioemotional development during institutionalization. These results suggest caregiver sensitivity is more highly related to cognitive development whereas caregiver consistency is more related to socioemotional development in the first years of life.
