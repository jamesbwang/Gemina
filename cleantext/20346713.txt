  Retrospective analysis of the efficacy for two commonly used antibiotic regimens in the management of severe odontogenic infections. Evaluation of records of patients admitted to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery service at Boston University Medical Center from 2009 to 2014 with severe infections of odontogenic origin ( SOI). Patients were divided into two groups based on the administered intravenous antibiotic: 1) Group I: Clindamycin only and 2) Group II: Penicillin and Metronidazole. Variables evaluated included demographic characteristics , ASA status , and anatomic site of infection risk , length of hospital stay , antibiotic failure , and pharmaceutical treatment cost. 78 patients ( 46 males and 32 females) were included in the study. There were 57 patients in group I ( average age 32.6 years) and 21 in Group II ( average age 32.8 years). The average white cell count at time of admission count was higher in Group I ( 19.3) versus Group II ( 17.4). Antibiotic failure rate was 3.5 % in Group I and 4.7 % for group 2 patients. Clindamycin alone and combination of Penicillin with Metronidazole are both effective pharmaceutical regimens for SOI. Clindamycin therapy resulted in shorter hospital stay and lower net treatment costs with a slightly higher success rate.
