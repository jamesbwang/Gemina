  Brain network activity derives from the concerted action of different cell populations. Together with interneurons , astrocytes play fundamental roles in shaping the inhibition in brain circuitries and modulating neuronal transmission. In this review , we summarize past and recent findings that reveal in neural networks the importance of the interaction between GABAergic signaling and astrocytes and discuss its physiological and pathological relevance.
