  A general consensus has not yet been reached regarding the role of disorganization symptoms in real-world functioning in schizophrenia. We used structural equations modeling ( SEM) to analyze the direct and indirect associations between disorganization and real-world functioning assessed through the Specific Levels of Functioning Scale ( SLOF) in 880 subjects with schizophrenia. We found that: 1) conceptual disorganization was directly and strongly connected with SLOF daily activities; difficulty in abstract thinking was associated with moderate strength to all SLOF domains , and poor attention was connected with SLOF work skills; 2) grandiosity was only related with poor work skills , and delusions were associated with poor functioning in all SLOF domains; interpersonal relationships were weakly indirectly influenced by hallucinatory behavior , delusions and unusual thought contents through the mediation of social cognition ( SC); 3) among the negative symptoms , avolition had only direct links with SLOF work skills and SLOF activities; anhedonia had direct links with SLOF work skills and SLOF interpersonal and indirect link with SLOF work skills through functional capacity ( FC); asociality with SLOF interpersonal; blunted affect had direct links with SLOF activities and indirect links with SLOF interpersonal relationships mediated by SC. Lastly , alogia had only indirect links mediated by SC , FC , and neurocognition ( NC). Overall conceptual disorganization is the symptom that contributed more ( both directly and indirectly) to the activities of community living in real-world. Thus , it should be considered as a treatment target in intervention programs for patients with schizophrenia.
