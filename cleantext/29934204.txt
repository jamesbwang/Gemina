A carrier of ESBL can potentially be stressful for individuals , affecting their daily lives. The purpose of this study was to increase the understanding of experiences and consequences of being an ESBL carrier. A modified version of the grounded theory was used to analyze 16 open interviews. The analysis resulted in the core category `` to handle the new life situation. '' The results showed a lack of information being passed by attending doctors to study participants about ESBL and the consequences for their daily lives.

Armed with this information , they developed strategies to continue with their lives as before. As patients they experienced staff that were respectful , showed no stigmatization toward ESBL carriership , and used correct hygiene routines. When the information from the attending doctor about ESBL carriers is insufficient , patients often use the Internet to obtain additional information. With the use of this information , patients develop strategies to cope with their lives.
