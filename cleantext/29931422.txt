  Minimal model analysis of intravenous glucose tolerance test ( IVGTT) data represents the reference method to assess insulin sensitivity ( S Three groups of subjects reflecting different glucose tolerance degrees underwent a 3 h IVGTT: subjects with normal glucose tolerance ( NGT , n = 164) , with defective glucose regulation ( DGR , n = 191) , and with type 2 diabetes ( T2D , n = 39). Minimal model analysis provided reference S CS The interest for insulin-independent glucose disappearance is increasing , due to the recent availability of SGLT2 pharmacological agents , lowering glycemic levels without requiring insulin action. This study proposes a reliable predictor of S
