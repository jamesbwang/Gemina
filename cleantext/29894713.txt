  Drosomycin-type antifungal peptides ( DTAFPs) are natural effectors of the innate immune system , which are restrictedly distributed in plants and ecdysozoans. Mehamycin is a bi-domain DTAFP ( abbreviated as bDTAFP) firstly found in the Northern root-knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla. Here , we report its structural and functional features and the evolution of bDTAFPs in nematodes. Different from classical DTAFPs , mehamycin contains an insertion , called single Disulfide Bridge-linked Domain ( abbreviated as sDBD) , located in a loop region of the drosomycin scaffold. Despite this , recombinant mehamycin likely adopts a similar fold to drosomycin , as revealed by the circular dichroism spectral analysis. Functionally , it showed some weak activity against three species of fungi<pathogen> but relatively stronger activity against seven species of Gram-positive bacteria , indicative of functional diversification between mehamycin and classical DTAFPs. By computational data mining of the nematode databases , we identified polymorphic genes encoding mehamycin and a new multigene family of bDTAFPs ( named roremycins) from Rotylenchulus reniformis. A combination of data suggests that the origination of sDBDs from M. hapla and R. reniformis is a consequence of convergent evolution , in which some probably suffered positive selection during evolution. Our study may be valuable in understanding the role of these unique antimicrobial peptides in the innate immunity of nematodes.
