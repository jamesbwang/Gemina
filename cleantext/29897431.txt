  Cardiovascular diseases are prominent cause of death. Lifestyle change is effective in decreasing mortality. Perception of patients ' cardiovascular risk by physicians is a drive for following preventive recommendations. Whether the hazard perceived by patients influences their attitude towards lifestyle is uncertain. We hypothesized that high perceived risk would be associated with a stronger determination for lifestyle change , while incorrectly optimistic patients would be less motivated. Two hundred patients visiting their family physicians were asked to fill out a questionnaire about demographic , clinical and lifestyle characteristics , about their attitude towards lifestyle change and their estimation of their cardiovascular risk. Actual risk was estimated by family physicians based on the national guideline. Questionnaires were completed by 80.5 % ( 161/200) of patients approached. Patients underestimated their risk ( P < 0.001) , mainly because high-/ very high-risk patients classified themselves into lower risk categories. The majority of patients were planning a lifestyle change , losing weight being the most popular goal. It was the priority even for some normal weight subjects and for smokers , too. Perceived risk played a marginal role as a determinant of lifestyle change. Underestimation of perceived risk had no effect on patients ' motivation. Self-rated obesity was the predictor of three out of five means of change ( weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , diet , physical activity). Perceived cardiovascular risk and incorrect optimism about this hazard have minimal , if any , influence on attitude towards lifestyle change. Patients ' motivation seems not to be primarily health related.
