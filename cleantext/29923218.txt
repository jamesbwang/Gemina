  Acute kidney injury ( AKI) results in retention of waste products and dysregulation of extracellular volume and electrolytes , thus leading to a variety of complications. Recent advances in long noncoding RNAs suggested their close relationship with disease progression. In the current study , we investigated the role and mechanism of maternally expressed gene 3 ( MEG3) on AKI pathogenesis. Real-time polymerase chain reaction found that the expression of MEG3 was significantly increased in both kidney tissues and TKPTS cells induced by lipopolysaccharide ( LPS). Western blot assay showed that the expression of apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 was increased in MEG3-inhibited TKPTS cells. Flow cytometry assay confirmed that LPS-induced apoptosis was significantly attenuated after transfection of si-MEG3. The RNAhybrid informatics algorithm predicted that there was a strong binding capacity between miR-21 and MEG3. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that MEG3 could function as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-21. The antiapoptotic effect of si-MEG3 could be neutralized by a miR-21 inhibitor , demonstrated by the decreased expression of Bcl-2 and flow cytometry results. Further investigation showed that programmed cell death protein 4 ( PDCD4) , a validated target of miR-21 , was highly expressed in both injured kidney tissues and LPS-stimulated TKPTS cells. Meanwhile , the protein expression of PDCD4 was significantly reduced by inhibition of MEG3 , but retrieved by coinhibition of MEG3 and miR-21. In conclusion , our results demonstrated that inhibition of MEG3 could attenuate LPS-induced apoptosis in TKPTS cells by regulating the miR-21/ PDCD4 pathway , suggesting that the MEG3/miR -21/ PDCD4 axis could be developed as a potential therapeutic target of AKI.
