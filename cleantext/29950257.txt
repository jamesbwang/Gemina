  To identify the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) in colorectal cancer ( CRC) and its relationship with clinicopathologic factors. Descriptive study. Department of Laboratory and Blood Bank , King Abdul Aziz Specialist Hospital , Taif , Saudia Arabia , from January 2008 to June 2011. Diagnosed cases of colorectal carcinoma reports and slides were reviewed and cilnicopathological features were recorded. EGFR immunohistochemical staining was performed. All slides were assessed by light microscopy and scored after assessing the percentage of cells staining ( grade) and intensity of the staining. Colectomy specimens of colorectal carcinomas with complete clinical information and good fixation were included. Biopsies specimens diagnosed as colorectal adenocarcinomas were excluded. The studied characteristics included age , gender , clinical presentation , tumor site , tumor size , degree of histological differentiation ( well , moderate , poor) , vascular and perineural invasion. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS version14 and Chi-square test was used for comparing the histological factors with EGFR expression. Thirty-five colectomy specimens showed mean age of 61.5 Â± 12.36 years and male to female ratio 1:2 ( 35 % and 65 % , respectively). Expression of EGFR was detected in 74 % of the studied specimens. There was strong expression in most of cases. EGFR expression was found in mostly grade II ( 85 %) and stage T3 tumors ( 69 %). Patients presented mostly with late stages of CRC and EGFR was expressed on tumor cells in the majority.
