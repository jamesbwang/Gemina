  Huntington 's disease ( HD) patients often report anorectal dysfunction; however , in HD research no detailed analysis of these complaints has been published. To report anorectal dysfunction in a systematically studied cohort of HD subjects. In 54 HD patients ( 24 men) and 10 presymptomatic HD mutation carriers ( 2 men) and in 99 controls ( 44 men) a history of anal incontinence and constipation<symptom> was obtained and data was compared accordingly. In HD mutation carriers a clinical neurologic assessment and in some cases anorectal manometry were performed. Defecation urgency was reported by 28 % of our HD mutation carriers , soiling in 18 % and fecal incontinence in 28 %. Severe anal incontinence ( solid stools<symptom>) was found in 0 % men/ 10 % women , moderate ( liquid stools<symptom>) in 21 %/ 13 % , and mild ( flatus only) in 67 %/ 47 % of our HD subjects. Compared to controls , anal incontinence was significantly more common in HD subjects ( p < 0.001). Severe chronic constipation<symptom> was found in 4.2 % men/ 0.0 % women , moderate in 8.3 %/ 0.0 % , and mild in 21 %/ 27 % of HD subjects. Constipation<symptom> was more common in HD men ( p = 0.02) than in HD women ( p = 0.144). Anorectal dysfunction was not reported by 54 % of our HD subjects. Patients reporting incontinence or constipation<symptom> were significantly more depressed ( r = 0.53 , p = 0.001). Upon anorectal manometry reduced resting anal pressure was found in 4 of 6 HD women. Our study demonstrated significant bowel dysfunction in HD patients. We propose these symptoms to be of central autonomic origin , although we can not exclude effects of medication. These often neglected symptoms in HD subjects require greater attention from physicians.
