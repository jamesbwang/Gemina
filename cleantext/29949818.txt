  To outline the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with deep intestinal endometriosis submitted to surgical treatment at a tertiary referral center with a multidisciplinary team , and correlate those characteristics with the surgical procedures performed and operative complications. A prospective cohort from February 2012 to November 2016 of 32 women with deep intestinal endometriosis operations. The variables analyzed were: age; obesity; preoperative symptoms ( dysmenorrhea , dyspareunia , acyclic pain , dyschezia , infertility<symptom> , urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , constipation<symptom> and intestinal<symptom> bleeding<symptom>); previous surgery for endometriosis; Enzian classification; size of the intestinal<symptom> lesion<symptom>; and surgical complications. The mean age was 37.75 ( ± 5.72) years. A total of 7 patients ( 22 %) had a prior history of endometriosis. The mean of the largest diameter of the intestinal<symptom> lesions<symptom> identified intraoperatively was of 28.12 mm ( ± 14.29 mm). In the Enzian classification , there was a predominance of lesions<symptom> of the rectum and sigmoid , comprising 30 cases ( 94 %). There were no statistically significant associations between the predictor variables and the outcome complications , even after the multiple logistic regression analysis. Regarding the size of the lesion<symptom> , there was also no significant correlation with the outcome complications ( The studied sample consisted of highly symptomatic women. A high prevalence of deep infiltrative endometriosis lesions<symptom> was found located in the rectum and sigmoid region , and their size correlated directly with the extent of the surgical resection performed.
