  Understanding people 's experience of skin ageing as it is lived can enable sensitive approaches to promoting healthy skin and to care in general. By understanding the insider perspective , what it is like for individuals , a way to sensitise practice for more humanly sensitive care is offered. Through interviews with seventeen community-dwelling older people , the essential meaning of living within ageing skin was illuminated as a state of managed inevitability. The skin is inevitably changing , and ageing skin is a marker of change over time but the person within remains. Constituents of the phenomenon comprise the experience of unfamiliar sights and sensations given by ageing skin; facing and accepting bodily changes and seeing this back and forth in family connections; taking care of the skin `` to face '' the world; and to present oneself to others and a different place in the world , same person , changed body. Findings point to why and how nurses can treat older people as persons by not over emphasising a view on ageing bodies or bodies with aged skin alone , but in tempering this view with deeper existential insights , meeting the older person with a skin care need as a person and not just as a physical entity.
