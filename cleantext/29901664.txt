  Highly sensitive detection of nucleic acids is crucial for genomics , transcriptomics , and heterogeneity studies. Conventional fluorescence polarization and intensity-based assays for DNA/RNA measurements often suffer from a poor limit of detection and a long test period. A versatile nanoscale probe based on a competitive displacement assay and fluorescence polarization was proposed for the simple , fast and sensitive detection of nucleic acids. For the probe , a partially complementary double-stranded DNA ( dsDNA) was used as a connector of gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs) and Alexa fluor 488 dyes ( Alexa488) , leading to the nanometal surface energy transfer ( NSET) between Alexa488 and AuNPs. Meanwhile , suppression of the fluorescence intensity caused a decrease in the effective concentration of the Alexa488 , and an increase in the volume or mass prolonged the rotational relaxation time of the Alexa488 , both of which increased polarization of the Alexa488 in an aqueous solution. After competitive displacement between the probe and the target strand , the decrease in the volume or mass of the Alexa488 and fluorescence recovery resulted in the decline of the fluorescence polarization of the Alexa488 , which could be used to sensitively detect the target concentration. After optimization , the fluorescence polarization-based method achieved a pM level detection of single-stranded nucleic acids within 30 minutes.
