  We conducted a prospective study to investigate the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment on alleviating facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom> , as well as the anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> that are associated with it. Our study population was made up of 105 patients-59 men and 46 women , aged 18 to 60 years ( mean: 38.2)- who had acute idiopathic peripheral facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom>. Before treatment , paralysis was classified as House-Brackmann grade II or III in 44 patients ( 41.9 %) and grade IV to VI in the remaining 61 ( 58.1 %). After treatment , 73 patients ( 69.5 %) improved to grade I , 29 ( 27.6 %) were at grade II or III , and only 3 ( 2.9 %) remained at grade IV or higher. Mean scores on the Beck anxiety<symptom> inventory , the Beck depression<symptom> inventory , and the Beck hopelessness scale were 20.30 , 19.75 , and 7.57 , respectively , before treatment and 5.72 , 5.68 , and 2.85 afterward; the difference in all three measures was statistically significant ( p < 0.001). We found no correlation between the degree of facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> levels ( r = 0.094 , p = 0.338) or depression<symptom> levels ( r = 0.181 , p = 0.064). Clinicians should consider asking patients with peripheral facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom> about their feelings of anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> , and hopelessness and refer them for a psychiatric consultation if necessary.
