  Rapid evolution in response to environmental change will likely be a driving force determining the distribution of species across the biosphere in coming decades. This is especially true of microorganisms , many of which may evolve in step with warming , including phytoplankton , the diverse photosynthetic microbes forming the foundation of most aquatic food webs. Here we tested the capacity of a globally important , model marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana , for rapid evolution in response to temperature. Selection at 16 and 31 Â°C for 350 generations led to significant divergence in several temperature response traits , demonstrating local adaptation and the existence of trade-offs associated with adaptation to different temperatures. In contrast , competitive ability for nitrogen ( commonly limiting in marine systems) , measured after 450 generations of temperature selection , did not diverge in a systematic way between temperatures. This study shows how rapid thermal adaptation affects key temperature and nutrient traits and , thus , a population 's long-term physiological , ecological , and biogeographic response to climate change.
