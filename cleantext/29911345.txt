  Current postsurgical atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) ablation guidelines encourage serial rhythm evaluation; however , traditional Holter monitoring may be cumbersome for patients and yield limited data. An implantable loop recorder ( LR) may provide increased data on the incidence of postablation arrhythmias. We sought to evaluate the use of a new generation LR implanted during surgical AF ablation. A retrospective analysis was performed on adult patients undergoing surgical AF ablation. All patients had subcutaneous placement of a LR. Data were collected on patient demographics , concomitant surgical procedures , complications , loop recorder extraction , and additional arrhythmia interventions. Thirty-one patients underwent surgical AF ablation with intraoperative placement of a LR during the study period. The median age was 71 and the majority had long-standing persistent AF. Mitral and aortic valve pathology was the most common reason for concomitant operations. Four devices were explanted prior to the completion of follow-up due to high AF burdens detected by the LR requiring catheter ablation or pacemaker placement. A 100 % correlation between in-clinic rhythm detected by the LR and electrocardiogram was observed. No infectious complications , device malfunctions , or deaths occurred. LRs placed intraoperatively during surgical ablation of AF are feasible and with nominal , if any , complications. More comprehensive rhythm analysis may aid with determination of operative success and the need for additional intervention or cessation of antiarrhythmic or anticoagulant medications.
