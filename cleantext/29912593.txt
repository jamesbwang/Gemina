  This study aimed to estimate the cost of platelet transfusion in patients with chronic liver disease ( CLD)- associated thrombocytopenia<symptom> undergoing an elective procedure in the United States. The study was conducted in two parts: development of a conceptual framework identifying direct , indirect and intangible costs of platelet transfusion , followed by the estimation of the total cost of platelet transfusion in patients with CLD-associated thrombocytopenia<symptom> before an elective procedure in the United States using the conceptual framework and cost data obtained from a literature search. The cost of the entire care required to raise a patient 's platelet count before the procedure was considered. The final conceptual framework included the costs of generating the supply of platelets , the platelet transfusion itself , adverse events associated with platelet transfusion and refractoriness to platelet transfusion. When costs were accounted for in all the framework cost categories , the total direct cost of a platelet transfusion in a patient with CLD and associated thrombocytopenia<symptom> was estimated to be in the range of $ 5258 to $ 13,117 ( 2017 US dollars) in the United States. The largest portion of costs was incurred by the transfusion event itself ( $ 3723 to $ 4436) and the cost of refractoriness ( $ 874 to $ 7578) , which included the opportunity cost of a delayed procedure and subsequent platelet transfusions with human leukocyte antigen-matched platelets. Although we were unable to include all cost components identified in the conceptual framework in our total cost estimate , thus likely underestimating the true total cost , and despite the data gaps and challenges limiting our estimate of the full cost of a platelet transfusion in patients with CLD-associated thrombocytopenia<symptom> undergoing an elective procedure in the United States , this study outlines a comprehensive conceptual framework for estimating the cost elements of a platelet transfusion in these patients.
