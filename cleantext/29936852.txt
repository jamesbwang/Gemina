  Objective Autonomic dysfunction is recognized in patients with coronary artery disease ( CAD) and is related to worse cardiovascular outcome. This study aimed to evaluate cardiac autonomic nervous function by heart rate recovery ( HRR) and heart rate variability ( HRV) , and demonstrate their relationship with the severity of coronary lesions<symptom> in patients with stable CAD ( SCAD). Methods Consecutive patients without CAD ( controls , n = 65) and those with SCAD ( n = 63) were included in this study. Patients with SCAD were further divided into single- or two-/ three-vessel disease , as well as < 70 % or â‰¥ 70 % stenosis subgroups. The association between HRR/HRV and coronary lesions<symptom> was analysed. Results HRR and HRV values were significantly lower in the SCAD group compared with the control group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that abnormal HRR and HRV were risk factors of SCAD. Moreover , delayed HRR was a risk factor of the severity of coronary lesions<symptom>. Conclusions Our results show that autonomic function is impaired in patients with SCAD and delayed HRR is closely related to the severity of coronary
