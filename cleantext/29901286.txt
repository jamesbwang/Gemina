  The aim of this study was to identify echocardiographic predictors of improved or worsening renal function during intravenous diuresis for decompensated heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Secondary aim included defining the incidence and clinical risk factors for acute changes in renal function with decongestion. A retrospective review of 363 patients admitted to a single centre for decompensated heart<symptom> failure<symptom> who underwent intravenous diuresis and transthoracic echocardiography was conducted. Clinical , echocardiographic , and renal function data were retrospectively collected. A multinomial logistic regression model was created to determine relative risk ratios for improved renal function ( IRF) or worsening renal function ( WRF). Within this cohort , 36 % of patients experienced WRF , 35 % had stable renal function , and 29 % had IRF. Patients with WRF were more likely to have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction compared with those with stable renal function or IRF ( P = 0.02). Patients with IRF were more likely to have a dilated , hypokinetic right ventricle compared with those with stable renal function or WRF ( P â‰¤ 0.01) , although this was not significant after adjustment for baseline characteristics. Left atrial size , left ventricular linear dimensions , and diastolic function did not significantly predict change in renal function. An acute change in renal function occurred in 65 % of patients admitted with decompensated heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. WRF was statistically more likely in patients with a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. A trend towards IRF was noted in patients with global right ventricular dysfunction.
