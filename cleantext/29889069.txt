  Hallucinations may have a broad spectrum and include so-called minor hallucinations ( MHs). MHs include passage hallucinations ( PHs) , visual illusions , and presence hallucinations ( PrHs). To determine the prevalence and characteristics of MHs in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( aMCI) patients , and to describe their potential relationship with cognition , behavioral symptoms , and use of psychoactive drugs. We have recruited prospectively and consecutively 268 subjects ( 90 AD mild-moderate drug-na√Øve patients , 78 aMCI , and 100 controls). All patients responded to a semi-structured questionnaire in order to rate psychotic phenomena. Clinical , neuropsychological , and demographic data of patients with and without MH were compared with those of age , sex , and education-matched controls. The prevalence of MHs was 21.1 % ( 19) in AD , 12.8 % ( 10) in aMCI , and 3 % ( 3) in controls ( p < 0.01). The most frequent MH was PrH ( 9.3 %) , followed by PH ( 4.9 %) and illusion ( 0.7 %). Eight ( 27.8 %) patients had more than one MH. After adjusting for age and gender , there was a negative correlation between the presence of MHs and MMSE score ( r = -0.261; p < 0.01) and a positive correlation between MHs and Neuropsychiatric Inventory score ( r = 0.237; p < 0.01). We did not observe a significant relationship between presence of MHs and the consumption of psychoactive drugs ( p > 0.05). We have shown that the presence of MHs in patients with newly diagnosed , untreated AD and aMCI is more than controls. MHs were correlated with other behavioral symptoms and a worse cognitive performance. We suggest the specific interrogation for MHs as a clinical feature for this population.
