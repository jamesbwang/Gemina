  Bullying is one of the most important factors associated with child abuse. However , robust tests supporting the assumption that being bullied can contribute to child sexual abuse ( CSA) among left-behind children ( LBC) remain sparse. This study aims to investigate the association of bullying victimization with CSA among LBC in China. A cross-sectional study was conducted in six middle schools of Sichuan and Anhui province in 2015. The bullying victimization was assessed by seven items from the Revised Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire. The experience of CSA was measured by ten items CSA scale with good consistency. A total of 1,030 children met the sampling criteria , including 284 LBC and 746 non-LBC. The prevalence of CSA was 22.89 % in LBC and 20.19 % in non-LBC ( Bullying victimization is associated with a significant increase in CSA among both LBC and non-LBC. Anti-bullying programs should target vulnerable populations including female LBC and LBC with siblings to reduce the risk of CSA.
