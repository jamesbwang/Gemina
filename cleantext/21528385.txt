  Kratom use as a herbal supplement is on the rise in the United States , with reported medical outcomes and lethal effects suggesting a public health threat. Even though the Drug Enforcement Administration has included kratom on its drugs of concern list and the FDA has published a press release to identify it as an opioid with a potential for abuse , its therapeutic and side effects are still not well defined in the literature. Here , we present a case of a 32-year-old man with a history of kratom use who became acutely ill with a brief prodromal illness , followed by jaundice and elevated liver enzymes showing a cholestatic picture , and his successful treatment. In this case , we emphasize the need for awareness of kratom exposure as a key contributor in the expansion of the opioid crisis , with therapeutic benefits earned at the expense of potentially lethal side effects.
