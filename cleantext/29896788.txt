  The transverse asymmetry ( sidedness) of phospholipids in plasma membrane bilayers is well characterized , distinctive , actively maintained and functionally important. In contrast , numerous studies using a variety of techniques have concluded that plasma membrane bilayer cholesterol is either mostly in the outer leaflet or the inner leaflet or is fairly evenly distributed. Sterols might simply partition according to their differing affinities for the asymmetrically disposed phospholipids , but some studies have proposed that it is actively transported to the outer leaflet. Other work suggests that the sterol is enriched in the inner leaflet , driven by either positive interactions with the phosphatidylethanolamine on that side or by its exclusion from the outer leaflet by the long chain sphingomyelin molecules therein. This uncertainty raises three questions: is plasma membrane cholesterol sidedness fixed in a given cell or cell type; is it generally the same among mammalian species; and does it serve specific physiological functions? This review grapples with these issues.
