  Italian External Quality Assessment ( IEQA) Program in Cytogenetics , established in 2001 by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† ( ISS) , covers both Constitutional and Oncohaematological diagnosis. In 2013 , performance criteria were defined and adopted. In this paper , we present the data from the first 4 years of activity ( 2013-2016) following the introduction of performance criteria. The enrollment is voluntary , fee-based and open to both public and private Italian laboratories. The scheme is annual and retrospective; a national panel of experts assess technical , analytical and interpretative performance. Overall , 95 distinct Italian laboratories participated in different Cytogenetics IEQA schemes over the 2013-2016 years and most of the laboratories took part in Constitutional diagnosis. General hospitals and local health centers represented 40 % of the total participants and the percentage of laboratories from Northern Regions was more than 45 % of total participants throughout the 4-year period. As regards the performance evaluation , on average , 11 , 9 and 23 % of participants were marked as poor performers in Prenatal , Postnatal and Oncohaematological schemes , respectively. With regard to critical errors , ISCN nomenclature in Prenatal and Postnatal schemes , and interpretation in Oncohaematological diagnosis , were identified as main issues. On the other hand , karyotype errors and inadequate analysis decreased strongly , over the 4 years , in Constitutional and Oncohaematological diagnosis , respectively. Our data show that the introduction of poor performance encourages laboratories to address critical issues , and the IEQA participation helps to improve quality in cytogenetic testing.
