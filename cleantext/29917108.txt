  Hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF) signals mediate mouse skeletal muscle stem cell , or satellite cell ( SC) , reentry into the cell cycle and myoblast proliferation. Because the athletic horse experiences exercise-induced muscle damage , the objective of the experiment was to determine the effect of HGF on equine SC ( eqSC) bioactivity. Fresh isolates of adult eqSC were incubated with increasing concentrations of HGF and the initial time to DNA synthesis was measured. Media supplementation with HGF did not shorten ( P > 0.05) the duration of G0/G1 transition suggesting the growth factor does not affect activation. Treatment with 25 ng/mL HGF increased ( P < 0.05) eqSC proliferation that was coincident with phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK) 1/2 and AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 ( AKT1). Chemical inhibition of the upstream effectors of ERK1/2 or AKT1 elicited no effect ( P > 0.05) on HGF-mediated EdU incorporation. By contrast , treatment of eqSC with 2 µm Gö6983 , a pan-protein kinase C ( PKC) inhibitor , blocked ( P < 0.05) HGF-initiated mitotic activity. Gene expression analysis revealed that eqSC express PKCα ,- δ and- ε isoforms. Knockdown of PKCδ with a small interfering RNA ( siRNA) prevented ( P > 0.05) HGF-mediated EdU incorporation. The siPKCδ was specific to the kinase and did not affect ( P > 0.05) expression of either PKCα or PKCε. Treatment of confluent eqSCs with 25 ng/mL HGF suppressed ( P < 0.05) nuclear myogenin expression during the early stages of differentiation. These results demonstrate that HGF may not affect activation but can act as a mitogen and modest suppressor of differentiation.
