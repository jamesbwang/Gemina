  Mitochondrial anti‑viral signaling protein ( VISA) , additionally termed MAVS , IPS‑1 and Cardif , is located at the outer membrane of mitochondria and is an essential adaptor in the Rig‑like receptor ( RLRs) signaling pathway. Upon viral<disease> infection<disease> , activated RLRs interact with VISA on mitochondria , forming a RLR‑VISA platform , leading to the recruitment of different TRAF family members , including TRAF3 , TRAF2 and TRAF6. This results in the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7 ( IRF3/IRF7) by TANK binding kinase 1 ( TBK1) and/or IKKε , as well as activation of NF‑κB , to induce type I interferons ( IFNs) and pro‑inflammatory cytokines. It remains to be elucidated how VISA functions as a scaffold for protein complex assembly in mitochondria to regulate RLR‑VISA antiviral signaling. In the present study , it was demonstrated that HAUS augmin like complex subunit 8 ( HAUS8) augments the RLR‑VISA‑dependent antiviral signaling pathway by targeting the VISA complex. Co‑immunoprecipitation verified that HAUS8 was associated with VISA and the VISA signaling complex components retinoic acid‑inducible gene I ( RIG‑I) and TBK1 when the RLR‑VISA signaling pathway was activated. The data demonstrated that overexpression of HAUS8 significantly promoted the activity of the transcription factors NF‑κB , IRF3 and the IFN‑β promoter induced by Sendai virus‑mediated RLR‑VISA signaling. HAUS8 increased the polyubiquitination of VISA , RIG‑I and TBK1. Knockdown of HAUS8 inhibited the activation of the transcription factors IRF‑3 , NF‑κB and the IFN‑β promoter triggered by Sendai virus. Collectively , these results demonstrated that HAUS8 may function as a positive regulator of RLR‑VISA dependent antiviral signaling by targeting the VISA complex , providing a novel regulatory mechanism of antiviral responses.
