  For genomic selection to be successful , there must be sufficient linkage disequilibrium between the markers and the causal mutations. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the extent of LD in ovine using the Santa InÃªs breed and to infer the minimum number of markers required to reach reasonable prediction accuracy. In total , 38,168 SNPs and 395 samples were used. The mean LD between adjacent marker pairs measured by r
