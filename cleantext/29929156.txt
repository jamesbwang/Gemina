  Parent-child interactions set the stage for child mental health and development. Given that maternal depressive symptoms are associated with poorer observed caregiving behaviors , examining potential cognitive mediators is important for identifying mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of risk and possible targets for intervention. We assessed depressive symptoms and levels of self-focus and psychological distancing from infant-centered verbal narratives obtained from 54 mothers , and examined caregiving behaviors in a structured interaction with their six-month-old infants. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with pronoun use in narratives ( i.e. , greater `` I '' and reduced `` we '' use) , reflecting increased self-focus and psychological distancing. Further , increased self-focus was associated with lower levels of caregiver warmth , and mediated the association between depressive symptoms and caregiving warmth. This observational study does not allow for causal interpretations. These findings suggest that the cognitive styles associated with depression<symptom> interfere with the caregiving relationship , affecting behavior in parent-child interactions that may increase the risk for the intergenerational transmission of
