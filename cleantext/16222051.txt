  Several anthropometric indices such as body mass index ( BMI) and waist circumference ( WC) have been examined as indicators of cardiovascular diseases , in both adults and children. However , the waist-to-height ratio ( WHtR) is considered a better predictor for the detection of cardiovascular risk factors , than BMI. We investigated the association between the WHtR and incident hypertension. A total of 1718 participants , aged 39-72 years , were recruited in this longitudinal study. Participants were divided into 2 groups according to the development of hypertension during 2005-2008 ( baseline) and 2008-2011 ( follow-up). Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the WHtR as a significant predictor of hypertension. During the 2.8 years of follow-up , 185 new cases of hypertension ( 10.8 %) were diagnosed , with an incidence rate of approximately 4 % per year. The WHtR was significantly higher in the participants who had developed hypertension than in those who had not ( 0.54 ± 0.05 vs. 0.51 ± 0.05 , p < 0.001). After adjusting for age , sex , smoking status , alcohol intake , regular exercise status , total cholesterol , and systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , at the baseline , the logistic regression analysis indicated that the participants with the highest quartile of the WHtR ( WHtR ≥ 0.54) were 4.51 times more likely to have hypertension than those with the lowest quartile ( odds ratio 4.51; 95 % confidence interval 2.41-8.43; p < .0001). The area under the curve for the WHtR , in identifying hypertension risk , was significantly greater than that for the BMI ( p = 0.0233). A positive association between WHtR and the incidence of hypertension was observed in Korean adults. The findings of the present community-based prospective study suggest that the WHtR may be a better predictor of incident hypertension.
