  The present cross-sectional serosurvey constitutes the first effort to describe the varicella zoster<disease> virus ( VZV) seroepidemiology in Serbia. An age-stratified serum bank of 3570 residual samples collected between 2015 and 2016 in each of the seven districts of the Vojvodina Province was tested for IgG anti-VZV antibodies with an enzyme immunoassay. Results were standardised into common units according to the European Sero-Epidemiology Network ( ESEN2) methodology. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to examine the relationships between standardised anti-VZV positivity or logarithmically transformed antibody titres and demographic features of study subjects. Seropositivity ( 85 % overall) increased with age , in parallel with geometric mean titres. By the time of school entry , 68 % of children were immune. The slower subsequent acquisition of immunity leaves epidemiologically relevant proportions of adolescents ( 7 %) , young adults ( 6 %) and especially females of reproductive age ( 6 %) prone to more severe forms of varicella. In the ongoing pre-vaccine era , natural infection provides a high level of collective immunity , with the highest VZV transmission in children of preschool age. The detected gaps in VZV immunity of the Serbian population support the adoption of the official recommendations for varicella immunisation of non-immune adolescents and young adults , including non-pregnant women of childbearing age.
