  The genome of sida golden mottle virus ( SiGMoV) ( GU997691 and GU997692) isolated from Sida santaremensis Monteiro in Manatee County , Florida , was sequenced and characterized. SiGMoV was determined to be a bipartite virus belonging to the genus Begomovirus with a genome organization typical of the New World viruses in the genus. SiGMoV DNA-A had the highest identity scores ( 89 %) and showed the closest evolutionary relationships to sida golden mosaic Buckup virus ( SiGMBuV) ( JX162591 and HQ008338). However , SiGMoV DNA-B had the highest identity scores ( 93 %) and showed the closest evolutionary relationship to corchorus yellow spot virus ( DQ875869) , SiGMBuV ( JX162592) and sida golden mosaic Florida virus ( SiGMFlV) ( HE806443). There was extensive recombination in the SiGMoV DNA-A and much less in DNA-B. Full-length clones of SiGMoV were infectious and were able to infect and cause symptoms in several plant species.
