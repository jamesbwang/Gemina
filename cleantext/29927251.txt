  Despite our growing molecular-level understanding of glioblastoma ( GBM) , treatment modalities remain limited. Recent developments in the mechanisms of cell fate regulation and nanomedicine provide new avenues by which to treat and manage brain tumors via the delivery of molecular therapeutics. Here , we have developed bioreducible poly ( β-amino ester) nanoparticles that demonstrate high intracellular delivery efficacy , low cytotoxicity , escape from endosomes , and promotion of cytosol-targeted environmentally triggered cargo release for miRNA delivery to tumor-propagating human cancer stem cells. In this report , we combined this nanobiotechnology with newly discovered cancer stem cell inhibiting miRNAs to develop self-assembled miRNA-containing polymeric nanoparticles ( nano-miRs) to treat gliomas. We show that these nano-miRs effectively intracellularly deliver single and combination miRNA mimics that inhibit the stem cell phenotype of human GBM cells in vitro. Following direct intratumoral infusion , these nano-miRs were found to distribute through the tumors , inhibit the growth of established orthotopic human GBM xenografts , and cooperatively enhance the response to standard-of-care γ radiation. Co-delivery of two miRNAs , miR-148a and miR-296-5p , within the bioreducible nano-miR particles enabled long-term survival from GBM in mice.
