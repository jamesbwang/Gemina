  Natural Language Processing- Patient Information Extraction for Researchers ( NLP-PIER) was developed for clinical researchers for self-service Natural Language Processing ( NLP) queries with clinical notes. This study was to conduct a user-centered analysis with clinical researchers to gain insight into NLP-PIER 's usability and to gain an understanding of the needs of clinical researchers when using an application for searching clinical notes. Clinical researcher participants ( n = 11) completed tasks using the system 's two existing search interfaces and completed a set of surveys and an exit interview. Quantitative data including time on task , task completion rate , and survey responses were collected. Interviews were analyzed qualitatively. Survey scores , time on task and task completion proportions varied widely. Qualitative analysis indicated that participants found the system to be useful and usable in specific projects. This study identified several usability challenges and our findings will guide the improvement of NLP-PIER 's interfaces.
