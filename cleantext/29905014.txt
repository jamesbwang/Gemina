  Vimentin is an intermediate filament ( IF) protein that is expressed in leukocytes , fibroblasts and endothelial cells of blood vessels. Vimentin filaments contribute to structural stability of the cell membrane , organelle positioning and protein transport. Vimentin self-assembles into a dimer that subsequently forms high-order structures , including tetramers and octamers. The details of IF assembly at crystallographic resolutions are limited to the tetrameric form. We describe a crystal structure of a fragment of a vimentin rod domain ( coil 1B) with a dimer of tetramers in the asymmetric unit. Coil 1B in the crystal is in an infinitely high-order filamentous assembly state , in which the tetramers are packed against each other laterally in an antiparallel fashion across the crystal lattice. In one of the directions of lateral packing , the tetramers pack against each other strictly head-to-tail , and in the orthogonal direction the tetramers pack in a staggered manner. This organization of the tetramers of coil 1B in the crystal lattice , together with previously reported biochemical and structural data , yield a model of high-order vimentin filament assembly. Structural data are available in the PDB under the accession number 5WHF.
