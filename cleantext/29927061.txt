  Animal camouflage represents one of the most important ways of preventing ( or facilitating) predation. It attracted the attention of the earliest evolutionary biologists , and today remains a focus of investigation in areas ranging from evolutionary ecology , animal decision-making , optimal strategies , visual psychology , computer science , to materials science. Most work focuses on the role of animal morphology per se , and its interactions with the background in affecting detection and recognition. However , the behaviour of organisms is likely to be crucial in affecting camouflage too , through background choice , body orientation and positioning; and strategies of camouflage that require movement. A wealth of potential mechanisms may affect such behaviours , from imprinting and self-assessment to genetics , and operate at several levels ( species , morph , and individual). Over many years there have been numerous studies investigating the role of behaviour in camouflage , but to date , no effort to synthesise these studies and ideas into a coherent framework. Here , we review key work on behaviour and camouflage , highlight the mechanisms involved and implications of behaviour , discuss the importance of this in a changing world , and offer suggestions for addressing the many important gaps in our understanding of this subject.
