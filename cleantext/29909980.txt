  Endothelial barrier dysfunction leads to increased endothelial permeability and is an early step in the development of vascular inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> such as atherosclerosis. Interferon-γ ( IFN-γ) , a proinflammatory cytokine , is known to cause increased endothelial permeability. However , the mechanisms by which IFN-γ disrupts the endothelial barrier have not been clarified. This study aimed to investigate how IFN-γ impairs the endothelial barrier integrity by specifically examining the roles of caldesmon , adherens junctions ( AJs) and p38 mitogen-activated protein ( MAP) kinase in IFN-γ-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. IFN-γ exhibited a biphasic effect on caldesmon localization and both the structural organization and protein expression of AJs. In the early phase ( 4-8 h) , IFN-γ induced the formation of peripheral caldesmon bands and discontinuous AJs , while AJ protein expression was unchanged. Interestingly , IFN-γ also stimulated caldesmon phosphorylation , resulting in actin dissociation from caldesmon at 8 h. Conversely , changes seen in the late phase ( 16-24 h) included cytoplasmic caldesmon dispersal , AJ linearization and junctional area reduction , which were associated with reduced membrane , cytoskeletal and total AJ protein expression. In addition , IFN-γ enhanced myosin binding to caldesmon at 12 h and persisted up to 24 h. Furthermore , inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by SB203580 did not reverse either the early or late phase changes observed. These data suggest that IFN-γ may activate signaling molecules other than p38 MAP kinase. In conclusion , our findings enhance the current understanding of how IFN-γ disrupts endothelial barrier function and reveal potential therapeutic targets , such as caldesmon and AJs , for the treatment of IFN-γ-associated vascular
