  The ageing population has led to increasing concerns about pensions and their future sustainability. Much of the dominant policy discourse around ageing and pension provision over the last decade has focussed on postponing retirement and prolonging employment. These measures are central to productive notions of ` active ageing '. Initially the paper briefly sets out the pension developments in the UK. Then it introduces active ageing and active ageing policy , exploring its implications for UK pension provision. It demonstrates that a more comprehensive active ageing framework , which incorporates a life-course perspective , has the potential to assist the UK to respond to the challenges of an ageing population. In doing so it needs to highlight older people as an economic and social resource , and reduce barriers to older people 's participation in society.
