  Fish liver is considered as a key organ that controls various life functions. The cellular and stromal elements of liver of eighteen specimens of adult grass carp were investigated by light- and electron- microscopy and enzyme histochemistry. The liver was formed of two lobes with a long process extended from the right lobe. Serial paraffin section of the liver identified different kinds of vascular- biliary structures as follows: 1) pancreatic-venous-biliary-arteriolar tracts ( P-VBAT); 2) venous-biliary-arteriolar tracts , ( VBAT); 3) pancreatic-venous-biliary tracts ( P-VBT); 4) venous-biliary tracts ( VBT); 5) venous-arteriolar tracts ( VAT); 6) isolated veins named as venous tracts ( VT); 7) isolated bile ducts , named as biliary tracts ( BT); 8) biliary-arteriolar tracts ( BAT); 9) pancreatic-biliary tracts ( P-BT); 10) pancreatic- venous tracts ( P-VT). Macrophages aggregates were associated with VBT and P-BT. The hepatic parenchyma was consisted of many populations of cells. Histochemically , the hepatocytes were strongly reacted with PAS , and Best 's carmine. Moreover , strong staining patterns for acid phosphatase , ATPase , and alkaline phosphatase were demonstrated in hepatocytes. The hepatic satellate ( Ito) cells were observed in the space of Disse and between hepatocytes. Rodlet cells and eosinophilic granular/ mast cells were encountered in the liver of grass carp. The sinusoids were lined by fenestrated endothelial cells and Kupffer cells. Moreover , dendritic-like cells were demonstrated in the sinusoids and perisinusoidal connective tissue. The biliary duct system was constituted of bile canaliculi , ductules , and bile ducts. Telocytes with their characteristics telopodes were located around bile ducts. The current findings are offering fundamental data on histology of grass carp liver.
