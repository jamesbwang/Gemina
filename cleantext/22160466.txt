  In vivo exploration of neurodegenerative diseases by positron emission tomography ( PET) imaging has matured over the last 20 years , using dedicated radiopharmaceuticals targeting cellular metabolism , neurotransmission , neuroinflammation , or abnormal protein aggregates ( beta-amyloid and intracellular microtubule inclusions<disease> containing hyperphosphorylated tau). The ability of PET to characterize biological processes at the cellular and molecular levels enables early detection and identification of molecular mechanisms associated with disease progression , by providing accurate , reliable , and longitudinally reproducible quantitative biomarkers. Thus , PET imaging has become a relevant imaging method for monitoring response to therapy , approved as an outcome measure in bioclinical trials. The aim of this paper is to review and discuss the current inputs of PET in the assessment of therapeutic effectiveness in neurodegenerative diseases connected by common pathophysiological mechanisms , including Parkinson 's disease , Huntington 's disease , dementia , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , multiple sclerosis , and also in psychiatric disorders. We also discuss opportunities for PET imaging to drive more personalized neuroprotective and therapeutic strategies , taking into account individual variability , within the growing framework of precision medicine.
