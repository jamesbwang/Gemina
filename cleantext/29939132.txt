  Moderate and severe forms of allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis<disease> and asthma are a challenge for clinicians. In these conditions , which severely affect the quality of life of the patient and frequently have associated allergic comorbidities , the therapeutic options are often very limited. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants has adverse effects in the long term , and a significant proportion of patients remain refractory to therapy. In this context , the emerging biological drugs constitute a truly innovative therapeutic approach. A leading example is dupilumab , a monoclonal antibody targeting the Î± chain of the interleukin ( IL) -4 receptor. Dupilumab inhibits the biological effects of the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 , which are key drivers in the TH2 response. The efficacy and safety profile of dupilumab in the treatment of allergic diseases has been tested for more than 10 years in a variety of large clinical trials in atopic dermatitis<disease> , asthma , chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis , and eosinophilic esophagitis. In 2017 , the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approved the use of dupilumab for the treatment of adult patients with moderateto-severe atopic dermatitis<disease> whose disease is not adequately controlled with prescribed topical treatment. The results of phase III clinical studies of dupilumab in patients with persistent , uncontrolled asthma have been highly promising. The safety and tolerability profile of dupilumab has proven to be very favorable in long-term clinical trials. In this review , we focus on the mechanism of action of dupilumab , its development , and its impact on daily clinical practice in allergic diseases.
