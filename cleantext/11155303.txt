  We aimed to describe a new C-shaped tear configuration , and to compare clinical outcomes and structural integrity between the C-shaped and the established crescent-shaped small to medium-sized rotator cuff tears after arthroscopic repair. This retrospective study included 102 patients who underwent arthroscopic repair in a single-row fashion for small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tears of either C or crescent shape from March 2009 to June 2014. Visual analogue scale ( VAS) pain score , subjective shoulder value ( SSV) , American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon ( ASES) score , and active range of motion ( ROM) were evaluated for functional outcomes. Postoperative magnetic resonance arthrography ( MRA) or computed tomographic arthrography ( CTA) was performed 6 months postoperatively to assess structural integrity. After 2 years of follow-up , both groups showed no significant difference in VAS pain score , functional scores , or ROM , although the C-shaped tear group exhibited significantly inferior outcomes 3 months after surgery. There was no significant difference in the re-tear rate on follow-up MRA and CTA between groups A and B ( 24.4 vs. 19.7 % , respectively; p = 0.570). The postoperative stiffness rate was significantly higher in the C-shaped tear group than that in crescent-shaped tear group only at 3-month follow-up point after surgery ( 26.8 vs. 9.8 % , respectively; p = 0.024). Contrary to our hypothesis , there were no significant differences in functional outcomes and structural integrity between C-shaped and crescent-shaped small- to medium-sized tears 2 years after arthroscopic repair. However , C-shaped tears exhibited significantly worse clinical outcomes , including a higher postoperative stiffness rate than crescent-shaped tears in the early postoperative period at the 3-month follow-up point.
