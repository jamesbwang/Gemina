  Alcohol withdrawal syndrome<disease> ( AWS) is a medical emergency , rare in the general population , but very common among alcoholic individuals , which can lead to severe complications when unrecognized or late treated. It represents a clinical condition which can evolve in few hours or days following an abrupt cessation or reduction of alcohol intake and is characterized by hyperactivity of the autonomic nervous system resulting in the development of typical symptoms. According to DSM-5 criteria , the alcohol withdrawal syndrome<disease> is defined as such: if patients present at least two of typical signs and symptoms. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale , revised version ( CIWA-Ar) , is the tool for assessing the severity of AWS. The support to patient with AWS includes pharmacological intervention as well as general support , restoration of biochemical imbalances and specific therapy. Regarding the pharmacological treatment , benzodiazepines represent the gold standard , in particular long-acting benzodiazepines , administered with a gradual reduction up to cessation.
