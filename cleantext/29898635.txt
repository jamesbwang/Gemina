  Completing an advance directive offers individuals the opportunity to make informed choices about end-of-life care. However , these decisions could be influenced in different ways depending on how the information is presented. We randomly presented 185 participants with four distinct types of advance directive: neutrally framed ( as reference) , negatively framed , religiously framed , and a combination. Participants were asked which interventions they would like to receive at the end of life. Between 60 % and 70 % of participants responded `` accept the special interventions '' on the reference form. However , the majority ( 70 % -90 %) chose `` refuse the interventions '' on the negative form. With respect to the religious form , 70 % to 80 % chose `` not decided yet. '' Participants who refused special life-sustaining treatments were older , female , and with better prior knowledge about advance directives. Our findings imply that the specific content of advance directives could affect decision-making with regard to various interventions for end-of-life care.
