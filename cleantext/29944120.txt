  Natural allelochemicals are considered as a source of algaecides. To uncover the anti-algal activity of Cinnamomum camphora fallen leaves and promote their usage as algaecides , the composition of their water and methanol extracts was analyzed , and the inhibitory effects of extracts on the growth of Microcystis aeruginosa<pathogen> and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , and chlorophyll ( Chl) content and photosynthetic abilities in C. reinhardtii were investigated. Twenty-five compounds were detected in the water extracts , mainly including terpenoids , esters , alcohols , and ketones. Compared to water extracts , there were more compounds and higher concentration in methanol extracts. Both water and methanol extracts inhibited the growth of the two algae<pathogen> , and 15 mg Â· ml
