  To assess counts of α4 and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in nasal polyps of adults with or without long-term exposure to cigarette tobacco smoke. Twenty-two patients with and 22 patients without exposure to cigarette tobacco smoke participated in the study. After endoscopic polypectomy , the fragments of the nasal polyps were analysed by immunohistochemistry. Compared to patients with no exposure , patients with exposure showed higher counts of α4 and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( t-test , p 0.05). Exposure to cigarette tobacco smoke may induce increased counts of α4 and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in nasal polyps of adults , with lower counts in males than females without exposure to tobacco smoke.
