  Uremic pruritus ( UP) is an unpleasant complication in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis. Cardiovascular and infection related deaths are the major causes of mortality in patients undergoing dialysis. Studies on the correlation between cardiovascular or infection related mortality and UP are limited. We analyze 866 maintenance hemodialysis ( MHD) patients in our hemodialysis centers. Clinical parameters and 24-month cardiovascular and infection-related mortality are recorded. The associations between all-cause , cardiovascular and infection related mortality with clinical data including UP are analyzed. Multivariate Cox regression demonstrated that UP is a significantly predictor for 24-month cardiovascular mortality in the MHD patients ( Hazard ratio: 3.164; 95 % confidence interval , 1.743-5.744; p < 0.001). Uremic pruritus is one of the predictor of 24-month cardiovascular mortality in MHD patients.
