  Natural products have long played a pivotal role in the development of therapeutics for a variety of diseases. Traditionally , soil and marine environments have provided a rich reservoir from which diverse chemical scaffolds could be discovered. Recently , the human microbiome has been recognized as a promising niche from which secondary metabolites with therapeutic potential have begun to be isolated. In this Review , we address how the expansive history of identifying bacterial natural products in other environments is informing the approaches being brought to bear on the study of the human microbiota. We also touch on how these tools can lead to insights about microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions and help generate biological hypotheses that may lead to developments of new therapeutic modalities.
