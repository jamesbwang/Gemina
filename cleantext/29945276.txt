  Cisplatin is an anti-cancer drug that causes nephrotoxicity and oxidative stress. Extracts of Nigella sativa is nephroprotective. Vitamin E is also a potent antioxidant. This study sought to determine a possible synergistic effect of administering the two agents prior to cisplatin use on nephrotoxicity and oxidative stress. 48 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups of 8 rats each. Group I served as the control. Group II received cisplatin without any treatment for 6 days. Groups III , IV , V and VI received 100 mg/kg Nigella sativa ( NS) , 200 mg/kg NS , 100 mg/kg Vitamin E and 200 mg/kg NS +100 mg/kg Vitamin E respectively for 5 days prior to 6 days administration of cisplatin. On the last day of the experiment , all the animals were sacrificed and serum samples collected for analysis. Cisplatin administration caused a significant increase in creatinine level ( p < 0.01) , urea level ( p < 0.01) , sodium concentration and malondialdehyde level ( p < 0.001). Pre-administration with NS caused a significant reduction in creatinine level ( p < 0.001) , urea level ( p < 0.001) , sodium concentration ( p < 0.001) and malondialdehyde ( p < 0.01) level. Pre-administration with vitamin E caused a significant reduction in creatinine level ( p < 0.001) , urea level ( p < 0.01) , sodium concentration ( p < 0.001) and malondialdehyde level. They both also caused a significant increase in superoxide dismutase , reduced glutathione and catalase ( CAT) levels. The combination of NS and vitamin E however did not show significant synergistic effects. These results suggest that even though pre-administration of the two agents protect against renal toxicity and oxidative stress , the effects are however not collaborative.
