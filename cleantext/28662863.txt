  Crizotinib , a small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitor , manifests dramatic responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( EML4-ALK) rearrangements. ALK gene point mutation is the primary mechanism of acquired crizotinib resistance; however , the intrinsic mechanism is not fully understood. Here , we report a patient with a low mutant allele fraction ( MAF) of EML4-ALK rearrangement , who experienced primary resistance to crizotinib treatment. The patient was a 66-year-old Chinese man , who had a history of metastatic lung cancer and was treated with first- and third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( EGFR TKIs). After 14 months of osimertinib treatment , his disease progressed , and next-generation sequencing was performed from a liquid biopsy of the patient 's blood. An EML4-ALK rearrangement was found and crizotinib was administered. The patient 's lung lesions<symptom> continued to progress after one month of crizotinib treatment , and pemetrexed-bevacizumab was initiated. After two cycles of chemotherapy , the metastatic cancers shrunk , and the patient maintained stable disease at his last follow-up. EML4-ALK rearrangements can happen in patients with EGFR-positive NSCLC , after acquired resistance to EGFR TKI treatment. The EGFR T790M and C797G mutations occur in cis is a critical mechanism of resistance to osimertinib therapy. The MAF of EML4-ALK rearrangements in cancer cells might be a predictive factor for crizotinib treatment.
