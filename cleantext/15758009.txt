  To study the prognostic value of neutrophil disorders in a retrospective cohort of high-grade glioma patients receiving definitive concurrent temozolomide and radiation. Clinical records of consecutive patients treated in our Institution between January 2005 and December 2010 with concurrent temozolomide ( 75 mg/m We identified 164 patients , all treated with concurrent temozolomide-based chemoradiotherapy. Initial surgery was achieved in most ( 75 %) , with resection > 90 % in 55 patients ( 34 %). Total 151 patients ( 92 %) had glioblastoma , and 13 patients ( 8 %) had WHO grade III glioma. Eighty-two patients ( 50 %) displayed pretreatment neutrophilia. Neutrophilia was not associated with concurrent or adjuvant temodal discontinuation ( p > 0.3). The 2-year actuarial overall survival was 45 %. Steroid consumption , i.e. 60 mg or more of daily prednisolone , increased pretreatment neutrophil count ( p = 0.005). In univariate analysis , neutrophilia was associated with worse overall survival ( p = 0.019) , as well as age ≥ 65 years ( p = 0.009) , surgical resection < 90 % ( p = 0.003) and prednisolone consumption ≥ 60 mg/day ( p = 0.016). In multivariate analysis , neutrophilia ( p = 0.013) , age ≥ 65 ( p = 0.001) , and surgical tumor resection < 90 % ( p = 0.010) independently decreased overall survival , while , steroid consumption was not ( p = 0.088). In high-grade gliomas treated with concurrent temozolomide and radiation , pretreatment neutrophilia may be a significant prognosis factor for overall survival. In addition with previously available markers , this independent cost-effective biomarker could help identifying patients with worsened prognosis.
