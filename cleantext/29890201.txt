  Black-capped chickadees ( Poecile atricapillus) use their namesake chick-a-dee call for multiple functions , altering the features of the call depending on context. For example , duty cycle ( the proportion of time filled by vocalizations) and fine structure traits ( e.g. , number of D notes) can encode contextual factors , such as predator size and food quality. Wilson and Mennill ( 2011) found that chickadees show stronger behavioral responses to playback of chick-a-dee calls with higher duty cycles , but not to the number of D notes. That is , independent of the number of D notes in a call , but dependent on the overall proportion of time filled with vocalization , birds responded more to higher duty cycle playback compared to lower duty cycle playback. Here we presented chickadees with chick-a-dee calls that contained either two D ( referred to hereafter as 2 D) notes with a low duty cycle , 2 D notes with a high duty cycle , 10 D notes with a high duty cycle , or 2 D notes with a high duty cycle but played in reverse ( a non-signaling control). We then measured ZENK expression in the auditory nuclei where perceptual discrimination is thought to occur. Based on the behavioral results of Wilson and Mennill , 2011 , we predicted we would observe the highest ZENK expression in response to forward-playing calls with high duty cycles; we predicted we would observe no significant difference in ZENK expression between forward-playing high duty cycle playbacks ( 2 D or 10 D). We found no significant difference between forward-playing 2 D and 10 D high duty cycle playbacks. However , contrary to our predictions , we did not find any effects of altering the duty cycle or note number presented.
