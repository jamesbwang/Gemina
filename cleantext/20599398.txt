  The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of perioperative administration of N-acetylcysteine , selenium and vitamin C on the incidence and outcomes of acute kidney injury after off-pump coronary bypass graft surgery. 291 patients requiring elective off-pump coronary bypass graft surgery were randomized to receive either N-acetylcysteine , vitamin C and selenium 600 mg , 1500 mg , 0.5 mg , and nothing orally twice a day , respectively , from the day before to 2 days after surgery. They were assessed for the development of acute kidney injury using Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria , time of onset , its severity and duration , duration of mechanical ventilation , intensive care unit and hospital length of stay , and in-hospital mortality. 272 patients completed the study. The total incidence of acute kidney injury was 22.1 % ( n = 60) with 14 ( 20.9 %) , 15 ( 22.1 %) , 21 ( 31.8 %) , and 10 ( 14.1 %) patients in the vitamin C , NAC , selenium , and control groups , respectively ( P = 0.096). We did not register significant differences in the incidence , the time of occurrence , the severity and the duration of acute kidney injury , as well as the duration of mechanical ventilation , the intensive care unit and hospital length of stay , and the in-hospital mortality among the four groups. We found that perioperative administration of N-acetylcysteine , vitamin C and selenium were not effective in preventing acute kidney injury and associated morbidity and mortality after off-pump coronary bypass graft surgery.
