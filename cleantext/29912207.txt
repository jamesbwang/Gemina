  The fusion of 3D anatomical models derived from high-fidelity pre-interventional computed tomography angiography ( CTA) , and x-ray ( XR) fluoroscopy to facilitate anatomical guidance is of huge interest for complex cardiac interventions like TAVI procedures with cerebral protection. Co-registration of CTA and XR has been introduced either based on additional intraoperative non-/ contrast-enhanced cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT) or two separate aortograms. With the related increase of radiation exposure and/or contrast agent ( CA) dose , a potential additional risk for the patient is introduced. Here , we propose a modified co-registration approach making use of arteriograms of the iliofemoral arteries , routinely performed during the femoral puncture and sheath introduction. On-the-fly refinement of the co-registration during the on-going procedure enables accurate co-registration without any additional angiograms , thus reducing CA , XR dose and procedure time , while simultaneously improving operator confidence and procedure safety.
