  We present findings from a study of outcomes of residential treatment for people who have mental illness , primarily schizophrenia-spectrum and bipolar disorders. The study assesses a range of individual variables before and after participation in the program , to examine clinical and personal recovery and facilitate program improvement. To our knowledge , it is the longest ongoing outcomes study ( 15 + years) of its kind. The program , Gould Farm , provides recovery-focused , milieu treatment on a 700-acre working farm. It integrates counseling and medication with a work program that provides opportunities for the development of daily living , social , and work skills as well as mental and physical health. Clients were interviewed in person at intake and at discharge. Also , since study year 10 when the follow-up arm began , former clients were interviewed at 6 , 18 , and 36 months postdischarge via phone. Interview protocols included standard measures of psychiatric symptoms and functioning , substance use , quality of life , and treatment satisfaction. Follow-up interview protocols also assessed individuals ' living , working , family , and social situations as well as their satisfaction in these areas of recovery. Statistically significant improvements on all measures were found at discharge , and were not moderated by key demographic or clinical factors. Preliminary follow-up data showed maintenance of treatment gains , and high treatment satisfaction. We discuss clinical implications of the findings as well as limitations , directions for future research , and recommendations for sustaining outcomes research in organized care settings.
