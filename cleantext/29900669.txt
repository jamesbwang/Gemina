  Solid organ transplant recipients have a high risk of keratinocyte carcinoma ( non-melanoma skin cancer). Consensus-based transplant guidelines recommend annual dermatological examination but the impact on skin cancer-related outcomes is unclear. We conducted a population-based , retrospective , inception cohort study using administrative health databases in Ontario , Canada to evaluate the association between adherence to annual dermatology assessments ( time-varying exposure) and keratinocyte carcinoma-related morbidity and mortality after transplantation. The primary outcome was the time to first advanced ( highly morbid or fatal) keratinocyte carcinoma. Among 10 183 adults receiving their first transplant from 1994 to 2012 and followed for a median of 5.44 years , 4.9 % developed an advanced keratinocyte carcinoma after transplant. Adherence to annual dermatology assessments for at least 75 % of the observation time after transplant was associated with a 34 % reduction in keratinocyte carcinoma-related morbidity or death compared with adherence levels below 75 % ( adjusted hazard ratio 0.66 , 95 % CI 0.48-0.92). Adherence levels were universally low ( median proportion of time spent in adherence 0 % , inter-quartile range 0-27 %). Only 45 % of transplant recipients had ever seen a dermatologist and 2.1 % were fully adherent during the entire observation period. Strategies are needed to improve adherence rates in order to help decrease long-term morbidity after transplant.
