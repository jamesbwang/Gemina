  To conduct a review of literature and quantify the effect that traumatic brain injury ( TBI) has on oculomotor functions ( OM). A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted from papers that objectively measured saccades and smooth-pursuit eye movements<symptom> in mild and severe TBI. The overall impact of TBI on OM functions was moderate and significant with an effect size of 0.42 from 181 OM case-control comparisons. The heterogeneity , determined using the random effect model , was found to be significant ( Q ( 180) = 367 , p < 0.0001 , I TBI often results in long-standing OM deficits. Experimental measures of OM assessment reflect neural integrity and may provide a sensitive and objective biomarker to detect OM deficits following TBI.
