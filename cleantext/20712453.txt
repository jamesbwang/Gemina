  Interferon ( IFN)- I and IFN-II both induce IFN-stimulated gene ( ISG) expression through Janus kinase ( JAK)- dependent phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT) 1 and STAT2. STAT1 homodimers , known as γ-activated factor ( GAF) , activate transcription in response to all types of IFNs by direct binding to IFN-II activation site ( γ-activated sequence)- containing genes. Association of interferon regulatory factor ( IRF) 9 with STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers ( known as interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 ( ISGF3)) or with STAT2 homodimers ( STAT2/IRF9) in response to IFN-I , redirects these complexes to a distinct group of target genes harboring the interferon-stimulated response element ( ISRE). Similarly , IRF1 regulates expression of ISGs in response to IFN-I and IFN-II by directly binding the ISRE or IRF-responsive element. In addition , evidence is accumulating for an IFN-independent and- dependent role of unphosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 , with or without IRF9 , and IRF1 in basal as well as long-term ISG expression. This review provides insight into the existence of an intracellular amplifier circuit regulating ISG expression and controlling long-term cellular responsiveness to IFN-I and IFN-II. The exact timely steps that take place during IFN-activated feedback regulation and the control of ISG transcription and long-term cellular responsiveness to IFN-I and IFN-II is currently not clear. Based on existing literature and our novel data , we predict the existence of a multifaceted intracellular amplifier circuit that depends on unphosphorylated and phosphorylated ISGF3 and GAF complexes and IRF1. In a combinatorial and timely fashion , these complexes mediate prolonged ISG expression and control cellular responsiveness to IFN-I and IFN-II. This proposed intracellular amplifier circuit also provides a molecular explanation for the existing overlap between IFN-I and IFN-II activated ISG expression.
