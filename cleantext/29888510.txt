  In survival analyses , inverse-probability-of-treatment ( IPT) and inverse-probability-of-censoring ( IPC) weighted estimators of parameters in marginal structural Cox models are often used to estimate treatment effects in the presence of time-dependent confounding and censoring. In most applications , a robust variance estimator of the IPT and IPC weighted estimator is calculated leading to conservative confidence intervals. This estimator assumes that the weights are known rather than estimated from the data. Although a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance of the IPT and IPC weighted estimator is generally available , applications and thus information on the performance of the consistent estimator are lacking. Reasons might be a cumbersome implementation in statistical software , which is further complicated by missing details on the variance formula. In this paper , we therefore provide a detailed derivation of the variance of the asymptotic distribution of the IPT and IPC weighted estimator and explicitly state the necessary terms to calculate a consistent estimator of this variance. We compare the performance of the robust and consistent variance estimators in an application based on routine health care data and in a simulation study. The simulation reveals no substantial differences between the 2 estimators in medium and large data sets with no unmeasured confounding , but the consistent variance estimator performs poorly in small samples or under unmeasured confounding , if the number of confounders is large. We thus conclude that the robust estimator is more appropriate for all practical purposes.
