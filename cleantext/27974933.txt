  To investigate the deterioration of the brain functions by diabetes mellitus ( DM) and the beneficial effect of caffeine. First , the component of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors ( NMDA) of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential ( fEPSP) were recorded in streptozotocin ( STZ)- induced DM and compared with control animals. Later , 40 mice were divided randomly into five groups ( 8 mice in each): ( 1) Normal control ( Cont) , ( 2) diabetic group ( DM) , ( 3) animals pretreated with i.p. caffeine before the induction of DM ( Pre Caf) , ( 4) acute caffeine-treated group ( Ac Caf) , and ( 5) chronic caffeine group ( Ch Caf). Learning and memory were assessed in Morris-Water maze , and motor coordination was tested by rotarod. A significant reduction in the NMDA-component of the fEPSPs responses was recorded in the hippocampus of the diabetic animals. All the DM-groups demonstrated defects in learning and memory tasks; only the Ac Caf group could reverse the deteriorating effect of DM. This group showed a significantly lower latency values to reach their target ( submerged platform) in the water maze in comparison to the DM , Pre Caf , and Ch Caf groups. Their performance was not significantly different from the control animals. Rotarod testing showed significant role of acute , but not chronic , caffeine administration in enhancing the motor skills. STZ- induced DM resulted into defects in memory tasks which are associated with a reduction in the hippocampal NMDA-receptor component of the fEPSP. Acute , but not chronic administration of caffeine could reverse the deteriorating effect of DM on learning and memory.
