  Despite the high prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder ( FASD) in youth criminal justice settings , there is currently no research supporting the use of violence risk assessment tools in this population. This study examined the predictive validity of the Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth ( SAVRY) and the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory ( YLS/CMI) in justice-involved youth with FASD. Participants were 100 justice-involved youth ( ages 12-23; 81 % male) , including 50 diagnosed with FASD and 50 without FASD or prenatal alcohol exposure. The SAVRY and YLS/CMI were prospectively coded based on interview and file review , with recidivism ( both any and violent specifically) coded 1-year post-baseline assessment. Results provide preliminary support for the validity of the SAVRY and YLS/CMI in predicting recidivism in justice-involved youth with FASD. Higher ratings across SAVRY and YLS/CMI domains were found in youth with FASD , underscoring a critical need for assessments and interventions to buffer recidivism risk and address clinical needs.
