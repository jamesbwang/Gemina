  Snakins are antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs) found , so far , exclusively in plants , and known to be important in the defense against a wide range of pathogens. Like other plant AMPs , they contain several positively charged amino acids , and an even number of cysteine residues forming disulfide bridges which are considered important for their usual function. Despite its importance , studies on snakin tertiary structure and mode of action are still scarce. In this study , a new snakin-like gene was isolated from the native plant Peltophorum dubium , and its expression was verified in seedlings and adult leaves. The deduced peptide ( PdSN1) shows 84 % sequence identity with potato snakin-1 mature peptide , with the 12 cysteines characteristic from this peptide family at the GASA domain. The mature PdSN1 coding sequence was successfully expressed in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> The purified recombinant peptide inhibits the growth of important plant and human pathogens , like the economically relevant potato pathogen Streptomyces scabies and the opportunistic fungi<pathogen> Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> and Aspergillus<pathogen> niger. Finally , homology and ab initio modeling techniques coupled to extensive molecular dynamics simulations were used to gain insight on the 3D structure of PdSN1 , which exhibited a helix-turn-helix motif conserved in both native and recombinant peptides. We found this motif to be strongly coded in the sequence of PdSN1 , as it is stable under different patterns of disulfide bonds connectivity , and even when the 12 cysteines are considered in their reduced form , explaining the previous experimental evidences.
