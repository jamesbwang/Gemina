  Molecular photonic wires ( MPWs) are tunable nanophotonic structures capable of capturing and directing light with high transfer efficiencies. DNA-based assembly techniques provide a simple and economical preparation method for MPWs that allows precise positioning of the molecular transfer components. Unfortunately , the longest DNA-based MPWs ( ∼ 30 nm) report only modest transfer efficiencies of ∼ 2 % and have not been demonstrated on solid-state platforms. Here , we demonstrate that DNA-based MPWs can be spin-coated in a polymer matrix onto silicon wafers and exhibit a 5-fold increase in photonic transfer efficiency over solution-phase MPWs. Cooling these MPWs to 5 K led to further efficiency increases ranging from ∼ 40 to 240 % depending on the length of the MPW. The improvement of MPW energy transport efficiencies advances prospects for their incorporation in a variety of optoelectronics technologies and makes them an ideal test bed for further exploration of nanoscale energy transfer.
