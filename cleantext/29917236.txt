  The current study sought to investigate whether credibility , expectancy , and acceptability of the Body Project is impacted by level of disordered eating pathology and whether perceived credibility , expectancy , and acceptability impacts treatment outcomes. The sample included 170 undergraduate women from a large public university. Participants completed self-report questionnaires on perceived credibility , expectancy , treatment acceptability , and disordered eating measures. A random subset of 51 participants provided 3-month follow-up measurements. Analyses revealed that post-prevention credibility , expectancy , and treatment acceptability scores were negatively associated with baseline thin-ideal internalization , baseline weight , and shape concerns , and positively associated with baseline body satisfaction and the baseline restraint subscale of the EDEQ. Perceived credibility , expectancy , and treatment acceptability were not associated with session attendance or 3-month follow-up disordered eating scores. The Body Project is effective at reducing disordered eating regardless of whether participants liked the program or not.
