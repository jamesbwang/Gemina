  Microsporidia<pathogen> are parasitic fungi-like organisms that invade the interior of living cells and cause chronic disorders in a broad range of animals , including humans. These pathogens have the tiniest known genomes among eukaryotic species , for which they serve as a model for exploring the phenomenon of genome reduction in obligate intracellular parasites. Here we report a case study to show an apparent effect of overall genome reduction on the primary structure and activity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases , indispensable cellular proteins required for protein synthesis. We find that most microsporidian synthetases lack regulatory and eukaryote-specific appended domains and have a high degree of sequence variability in tRNA-binding and catalytic domains. In one synthetase , LeuRS , an apparent sequence degeneration annihilates the editing domain , a catalytic center responsible for the accurate selection of leucine for protein synthesis. Unlike accurate LeuRS synthetases from other eukaryotic species , microsporidian LeuRS is error-prone: apart from leucine , it occasionally uses its near-cognate substrates , such as norvaline , isoleucine , valine , and methionine.
