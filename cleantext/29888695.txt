  To assess the diagnostic role of mean platelet volume in tonsillitis<disease> with and without peritonsillar abscess<disease> Mean platelet volume and other laboratory data were retrospectively investigated. Mean platelet volume was significantly lower in the tonsillitis<disease> group ( 7.8 per cent ± 0.7 per cent) than in the control group ( 8.7 per cent ± 0.6 per cent; p < 0.0001) , and it was significantly lower in the abscess<disease> group ( 7.5 per cent ± 0.6 per cent) than in the no abscess<disease> group ( 8.0 per cent ± 0.7 per cent; p = 0.0277). White blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels were not significantly different between patients with an abscess<disease> and those without. The mean platelet volume cut-off values for the diagnosis of tonsillitis<disease> and peritonsillar abscess<disease> were 7.95 fl and 7.75 fl , respectively. Our results suggest that a decreased mean platelet volume is associated with the development and severity of tonsillitis<disease> This finding provides useful diagnostic information for physicians treating patients with
