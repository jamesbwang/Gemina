  Periodic mesoporous organosilica ( PMO) thin films were synthesized by evaporation-induced self-assembly of 1,2-bis ( triethoxysilyl) ethane and an ionic Gemini 16-12-16 surfactant under acidic conditions. The films were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy , grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering , ellipsometric porosimetry , impedance measurements , and nanoindentation. The ease of control of the packing parameter in Gemini surfactants makes the PMO film templated by a Gemini an exciting first step towards small pore size PMO films with engineered mesostructures.
