  The intestinal microbiota is significantly altered in cirrhotic patients , but the composition of the intestinal microbiota in Mexican patients with the pathology has not been reported. The present study is an attempt to determine the type of intestinal microbiota in healthy subjects and in patients of Mexican mestizo origin that present with cirrhosis of the liver. Biochemical liver function parameters ( ALT , AST , GGT , BIL-T , etc.) were determined in 23 cirrhotic patients and 21 control subjects. The intestinal microbiota was established through 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The cirrhotic patients had elevated levels of ALT , AST , GGT ( 105.2 ± 77.7 vs. 20.99 ± 8.5 UI/L , 110 ± 68.6 vs. 23.39 ± 5.2 , and 119.1 ± 79.1 vs. 19.3 ± 15.2 UI/L , respectively) , IL-6 ( 1.64 ± 0.38 pg/ml , P < .001) , or TNFα ( 1.78 ± 0.3 , P < .05). The intestinal microbiota of the cirrhotic patients was less diverse , compared with that of the control subjects. At the level of the phylum , there was a significant increase in Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the patients with cirrhosis , compared with the controls ( 6.2 vs. 4.9 % and 44 vs. 46 % , respectively , P < .01). In contrast , there was a decrease in Firmicutes , Actinobacteria , and Fusobacteria in the cirrhotic patients. There was an increase in the Campylobacter<pathogen> and Gemella families in the cirrhotic patients , whereas Streptococcus<pathogen> and Veillonella had a positive association with serum ALT or AST levels. To the best of our knowledge , the present study is the first to demonstrate the type of intestinal microbiota in Mexican patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The extension of the findings in a larger cohort of subjects and the metagenome analysis will enable the creation of data that can have relevant treatment implications for this group of patients in Mexico.
