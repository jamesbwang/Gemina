  Quantum-chemical density functional theory calculations using the BP86 functional in conjunction with a triple-Î¶ basis set and dispersion correction by Grimme with Becke-Johnson damping D3 ( BJ) were performed for the title molecules. The nature of the bonding was examined with the quantum theory of atoms in molecules ( QTAIM) and natural bond order ( NBO) methods and with the energy decomposition analysis in conjunction with the natural orbital for chemical valence ( EDA-NOCV) analysis. The energetically lowest-lying form of Fe
