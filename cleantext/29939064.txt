  Two experiments were conducted to see if asking witnesses to take another look at the lineup after they voiced their identification decisions would alter their choices , and if confirming feedback could then be used to solidify the selections they shifted to. Participants watched a simulated crime and were asked to identify the culprit from a photographic lineup. After voicing their identification decisions , participants were prompted to re-examine the lineup. Half of the participants then received confirming feedback for their decisions , regardless of whether they shifted to a new picture or not. Later on , a different experimenter escorted participants to a second room and administered the same lineup again. In Experiment 1 ( N = 432) , biased instructions were used to encourage choosing , and when participants were prompted to re-examine the lineup , 70 % changed their identification decisions and selected a different picture. When that new selection was reinforced with feedback and participants were given a second opportunity to identify the culprit at a later time , 72 % selected the picture they shifted to as the culprit. Participants who made their decisions more quickly were less likely to shift , but accuracy did not predict shifting. This general pattern of findings was replicated using unbiased instructions in Experiment 2 ( N = 237). Results suggest that prompting witnesses to re-examine the lineup can often lead witnesses to change their identification decisions , and when the altered choice is reinforced , they will often stay with that influenced decision over time , asserting it with a high degree of confidence.
