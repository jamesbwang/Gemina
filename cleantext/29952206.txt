  Although DNA computation has traditionally been developed for parallel calculations in molecular analyses , this approach has recently been considered for use in diagnostic or medical applications in living systems. In this study , we propose that the DNA logic operation may be a powerful tool for the recognition of microRNA patterns , which may have applications for the early diagnosis of cancers. We developed a rapid , label-free decoding method for output diagnostic molecules using nanopore measurements. We designed diagnostic DNAs that autonomously recognized two microRNAs , miR-20a and miR-17-5p , and formed a four-way junction structure that was captured in the nanopore , showing long blocking currents. We analyzed the blocking duration based on the central limit theorem and found that four different operations , i.e. , ( 0 , 0) , ( 0 , 1) , ( 1 , 0) , and ( 1 , 1) , could be discriminated. This pattern recognition method has been differentiated from simple detection methods based on DNA computing and nanopore technologies.
