  Using the human sense of touch , pain control has been studied for decades. With the rise of Virtual Reality ( VR) and haptic technologies , creating VR and haptic sensations provide a unique opportunity for pain distraction. In this paper , we present an experimental study to test whether VR and mid-air ultrasound tactile stimulation reduce perceived pain simulated via the cold pressor test , i.e. , submerging a human hand in cold water ( 2 C) for as long as the test subject can. Fifty right-handed subjects participated in the study and three tasks were considered: task 1 involved experiencing the cold pressor test with no distraction ( considered as the control task) , task 2 involved playing a simple VR game with no tactile feedback , and task 3 utilized the same VR game with tactile feedback; tasks 2 and 3 were assigned in random order after task 1. The tolerance time , perceived pain rating , and quality of experience were evaluated and compared for the three tasks. Results demonstrated that when a VR task involves physical ( touch) interaction , tactile stimulation plays a significant role in increasing pain tolerance time. Furthermore , the study demonstrated that for high pain tolerance participants , tactile stimulation is more effective for pain distraction compared to low<symptom> pain<symptom> tolerance participants. Although there are no significant differences in perceived pain and quality of experience between VR and VR+T actile tasks , there are significant differences in tolerance time ( Wilcox signed rank test , p 0.05). It is presumed that VR and the tactile stimulation induces positive emotions when utilized ( for both valence and arousal).
