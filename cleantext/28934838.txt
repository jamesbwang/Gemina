  Peripartum cardiomyopathy ( PPCM) is a life-threatening , pregnancy-associated heart disease that develops towards the end of pregnancy or in the first months following delivery in previously healthy women. Understanding of the pathophysiology has progressed in recent years , highlighting an oxidative-stress mediated cleavage of the nursing hormone prolactin into a toxic 16-kDa prolactin fragment as a major factor driving the disease. The 16-kDa prolactin fragment induces detrimental but potentially reversible effects on heart function. Bromocriptine , a clinically-approved drug to block prolactin release , was initially tested in a PPCM mouse model where it efficiently prevented the onset of PPCM. Consequently , this treatment concept was transferred to and successfully used in humans as a bench-tobedside approach. Encouraging proof-of-concept studies led to a randomised trial that further strengthens the role of bromocriptine in addition to standard heart<symptom> failure<symptom> therapy in clinical practice. The aim of this article is to summarise this novel and disease-specific medical treatment , along with current knowledge on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of PPCM.
