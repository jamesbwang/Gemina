  Electrode materials exploiting multielectron-transfer processes are essential components for large-scale energy storage systems. Organic-based electrode materials undergoing distinct molecular redox transformations can intrinsically circumvent the structural instability issue of conventional inorganic-based host materials associated with lattice volume expansion and pulverization. Yet , the fundamental mechanistic understanding of metal-organic coordination polymers toward the reversible electrochemical processes is still lacking. Herein , we demonstrate that metal-dependent spatial proximity and binding affinity play a critical role in the reversible redox processes , as verified by combined
