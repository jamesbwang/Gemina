  Isopods are macrodecomposers in terrestrial ecosystems , contributing to soil organic matter breakdown and nutrient cycling. They have been considered sensitive in laboratory tests designed to evaluate contaminants effects and are considered likely candidates to have a standardized protocol for ecotoxicity tests. For this purpose , a reference substance should be proposed as positive control in laboratory tests. This work aimed to evaluate the avoidance behaviour of the isopod species Porcellio dilatatus to boric acid ( H
