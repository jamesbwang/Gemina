  Nearly half of newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer are low grade , noninvasive , and papillary tumors. The standard treatment for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC) has been transurethral resection of the bladder tumor ( TUR-BT) with or without adjuvant intravesical instillation ( IVI) of chemotherapy or Bacillus<pathogen> Calmette-Guerin ( BCG) therapy. NMIBC is known to be associated with high rates of recurrence and risk of progression. In this study , we have retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcome of initially diagnosed multiple low-grade Ta tumors , with a special focus on tumor recurrence and worsening progression ( WP) pattern. We retrospectively reviewed 42 patients with primary , multiple , low-grade Ta bladder cancer. We defined WP as confirmed high-grade Ta , all T1 or Tis/concomitant CIS of bladder recurrence , upper urinary tract recurrence ( UTR) , or progression to equal to or more than T2. The associations between clinico-pathological factors and tumor recurrence as well as WP pattern were analyzed. Tumor recurrence and WP occurred in 23 ( 54.76 %) and 8 ( 19.04 %) patients during follow-up ( median follow-up: 57.38 months) , respectively. WP to high grade/stage was seen in 8 patients. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that use of tobacco (
