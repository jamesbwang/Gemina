  Using the WHO International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health ( ICF) as a frame of reference , this study identifies the most common problems of functioning and the environmental factors that are experienced by patients with schizophrenia. An empirical cross-sectional multicentre study was conducted. Data were collected using a case record form , rated by health professionals , that contained 133 ICF categories and which also gathered clinical and sociodemographic information. A total of 127 patients with schizophrenia participated. The categories with a higher prevalence of impairment in the Body functions component were related to mental functions ( e.g. b164 Higher-level cognitive functions ( 97.6 %) , b152 Emotional functions ( 88.2 %)). Patients also showed impairment in several categories from the Activities and participation component , reflecting restrictions and limitations in several challenging everyday activities such as solving problems ( 77.2 %) , handling stress ( 87.4 %) , looking after one 's health ( 63.8 %) , informal social relationships ( 70.9 %) , economic self-sufficiency ( 68.5 %) , and leisure ( 79.5 %). Environmental factors were most frequently scored as facilitators. Support from family ( 94.5 %) and health professionals ( 99.2 %) , together with antipsychotic medication ( 96.9 %) and social ( 85.0 %) and health services ( 95.3 %) , were the most common factors for people with schizophrenia. Our study identified the most common problems in functioning and the environmental factors that are experienced by persons with schizophrenia. This kind of comprehensive approach to the assessment of functioning in schizophrenia could help to shape interventions for improving functioning in this population.
