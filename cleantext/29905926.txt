  The publication of the first non-randomised proof-of-concept trial of renal denervation as a treatment modality in treatment-- resistant hypertension set the stage for a search for novel devices with the expectation that technology would reduce the burden of hypertension by reducing or eliminating the costly and lifelong use of blood pressure-lowering medications. As we demonstrate in this review , this idea was so attractive to manufacturers and invasive cardiologists and radiologists that they overlooked decades of careful pathophysiological research in a disease that remains enigmatic but is still a major cause of cardio-vascular mortality worldwide. To make our point , we first reviewed the prevalence and risks associated with treatment-resistant hypertension. Next , we highlighted the key points required for the diagnosis of treatment-resistant hypertension , including the recording of ambulatory blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and the assessment of adherence to medication. Finally , we summarised new insights in the management of treatment-resistant hypertension by medication and devices as well as in future research. Throughout our review , we focused on new evidence that had become available since 2013. Our conclusion is that optimising medical treatment based on simple algorithms remains the state of the art in treatment-resistant hypertension.
