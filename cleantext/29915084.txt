  A charge density wave ( CDW) is one of the fundamental instabilities of the Fermi surface occurring in a wide range of quantum materials. In dimensions higher than one , where Fermi surface nesting can play only a limited role , the selection of the particular wavevector and geometry of an emerging CDW should in principle be susceptible to controllable manipulation. In this work , we implement a simple method for straining materials compatible with low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy ( STM/S) , and use it to strain-engineer CDWs in
