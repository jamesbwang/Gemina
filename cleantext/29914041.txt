  Hill-type musculotendon models are most commonly used in biomechanical simulations for their computational efficacy and efficiency. But these models are generally built for maximally-activated muscles and linearly scale muscle properties when applied to submaximal conditions. However , the precondition of this scaling , which is muscle activation and properties are independent each other , has been proven unreal in many studies. Actually , the maximal activation condition is not ubiquitous for muscles in vivo , so it is necessary to adapt the linear scaling approach to improve the model practicability. This paper aimed at proposing two improved Hill-type musculotendon models that are better suited for submaximal conditions. These two models were built by including the activation-force-length coupling and their biological accuracy and computation speed were evaluated by a series of benchmark simulations. Compared to experimental measurements , the percent root mean square errors of forces calculated by the two AFLC models were less than 13.98 % and 13.81 % respectively. However , the average running time of the second AFLC model was nearly 17 times that of the first one with only a little improvement in accuracy. The two AFLC models were validated more accurate than the common Hill-type model in submaximally activated conditions and the first one was recommended in the construction of upper-layer musculoskeletal models.
