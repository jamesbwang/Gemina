  Understanding the extent of the placebo effect in randomized controlled trials of studying nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH) is important for optimal trial design , including sample size calculations and treatment endpoint definition. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the placebo groups from randomized controlled trials of adults with NASH that provided histological and/or magnetic resonance image-based measurements of intrahepatic triglyceride. We identified trials through a comprehensive search of MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , and Scopus , from each database 's inception through January 2 , 2018. We identified 39 randomized controlled trials , comprising 1463 patients who received placebo. Histologic assessment data ( the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity scores , NAS) were available from 956 patients; magnetic resonance spectroscopy data were available from 295 patients and magnetic resonance proton density fat fraction measurements from 61 patients. Overall , 25 % of patients given placebo had an improvement in NAS by 2 or more points ( 95 % CI , 21 % -29 %) with moderate ( I In a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of NASH , patients given placebo have significant histologic , radiologic , and biochemical responses. The placebo response should be considered in designing trials of agents for treatment of NASH.
