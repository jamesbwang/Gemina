  Little was known about the arsenic metabolism and arsenic methylation associated with the changes of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> after reducing the arsenic in drinking water ( WAs). Therefore , urinary concentrations and proportions of arsenic species were determined for recovery ( RC) , improvement ( IC) , persistent ( PE) , aggravation ( AC) , new incidence ( NC) , and no sign ( HC) groups based on the changes of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> between before ( in 2004) and after ( in 2017) WAs reduction. The results indicate that the urinary concentrations of inorganic arsenic ( iAs) , monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA) , dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA) , and total arsenic ( TAs) were much higher for RC and IC groups than for the other groups in 2004 , while these values varied slightly among the groups in 2017. The urinary % iAs of all the groups was significantly decreased after WAs reduction. In contrast , the urinary % DMA of RC , IC , AC , and NC groups was increased. From 2004 to 2017 , the PE and HC groups had lower decrease rate of % iAs and % MMA , and increase rate of % DMA , primary methylation index ( PMI) , and secondary methylation index ( SMI) after WAs reduction. The adjusted odd ratios ( ORs) showed that the RC , IC , AC , and NC groups were positively related with % iAs and % MMA and were negatively correlated with % DMA , PMI , and SMI before WAs reduction. It can be concluded that higher urinary % iAs and % MMA before WAs reduction increased the probability of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> recovery and improvement , and the risks of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> aggravation and incidence. Higher increase rate of urinary % DMA was positively associated with of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> recovery and improvement. Moreover , higher urinary % iAs and % MMA or lower increase rate of urinary % DMA might increase the risk of skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> aggravation.
