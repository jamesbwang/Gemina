  Choosing a cardioplegic solution is a significant issue in modern cardiac surgery. Although different options are available , the optimal strategy for myocardial protection has not been established. The aim of this study was to compare intraoperative and postoperative effects of histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate ( HTK) solution with those of standard blood cardioplegia with St Thomas No 2 solution. The study was conducted using a large cohort of adult patients undergoing complex cardiac surgery. This study was a single center retrospective review of prospectively collected data. Between January 2008 and December 2015 , 4480 patients underwent cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB) and cardioplegic arrest. Patients were divided into a blood cardioplegia group ( n = 3852) and an HTK solution group ( n = 628). Propensity score matching was used to adjust for differences between the two groups , and 292 matched pairs were identified. The primary end point was Intensive Care Unit ( ICU) length of stay ( LOS). Secondary end points included intraoperative changes in serum sodium concentration , readmission to ICU , transfusion of blood products , 30-day hospital readmission , 30-day mortality , and the incidence of major postoperative complications. Results: No significant differences were found between the matched groups with regard to baseline characteristics. Aortic cross-clamp and CPB times were longer for the blood cardioplegia ( 147.4 versus 132.8 min; P < .001). Administration of HTK solution was associated with acute and transient hyponatremia ( 141 versus 130 mmol/L; P < .001). ICU LOS was comparable between the groups ( 5.4 versus 5.4 days; P = .585). No significant differences were noted in any other secondary end point. During complex cardiac surgery , both cardioplegia techniques were equivalent in terms of early clinical outcomes.
