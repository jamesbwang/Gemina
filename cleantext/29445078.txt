  Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in the world. MicroRNA- ( miR-) 628-3p plays critical roles in many cancers , including lung cancer. We investigated how miR-628-3p affected migration and apoptosis in A549 cells. We used bioinformatics algorithms to predict the miR-628-3p target gene to study the molecular mechanism by which miR-628-3p contributes to lung cancer. Then , we used the luciferase reporter assay to identify whether heat shock<symptom> protein 90a
