  Guatemala has a concentrated HIV<pathogen> epidemic disproportionately affecting men who have sex with men ( MSM) and transgender women. We recruited 205 self-identified MSM , bisexuals , transvestites , and transgender women in western Guatemala using long-chain peer referral , wherein `` seed '' participants were asked to invite as many as three acquaintances to participate in the study. Self-reported sexual or gender identity was MSM , 46 %; bisexual , 28 %; transvestite , 21 % , and transgender woman , 5 %. Median age of the participants was 23 years , and 36 % self-identified as being indigenous. Indigenous persons were more likely to self-identity as transvestite ( 32.9 % vs 13.8 % , P = 0.04) , strongly perceive themselves at risk for HIV<pathogen> ( 87.7 % vs 51.5 % , P = 0.001) , have had an HIV<pathogen> test in the last 12 months and know the result ( 97.3 % vs 85.4 % , P = 0.008) , and experience barriers to testing and treatment ( 86.3 % vs 67.7 % , P = 0.004). HIV<pathogen> prevention services for indigenous MSM should especially target transvestites and how to overcome stigmatization and barriers to care.
