  We demonstrate in vivo endoscopic optical coherence tomography ( OCT) imaging in the forward direction using a flexible fiber bundle ( FB). In comparison to current conventional forward-looking probe schemes , our approach simplifies the endoscope design by avoiding the integration of any beam steering components in the distal probe end due to two-dimensional scanning of a focused light beam over the proximal FB surface. We describe the challenges that arise when OCT imaging with an FB is performed , such as multimoding or cross coupling. The performance of different FBs varying in parameters , such as numerical aperture , core size , core structure , and flexibility , was consequently compared , and image quality degrading artifacts were described in detail. Based on our findings , we propose an optimal FB design for endoscopic OCT imaging.
