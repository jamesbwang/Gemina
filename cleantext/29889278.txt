  Ferrets are used for studying infections with wild-type Ebola<disease> virus isolates. Here , we investigated whether these animals are also susceptible to wild-type isolates of Marburg<disease> virus ( MARV). Ferrets were challenged intramuscularly or intranasally with MARV strain Angola and monitored for 3 weeks. Unexpectedly , the animals neither showed observable signs of disease nor died of infection , and viremia was not detected after challenge. All animals were seropositive for MARV-specific immunoglobulin antibodies. Confirmatory studies with MARV strain Musoke and Ravn virus yielded the same outcomes. Therefore , ferrets may be of limited usefulness for studying the pathogenesis of MARV and Ravn virus infections.
