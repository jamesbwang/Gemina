  Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder and is associated with significant morbidity. We sought to present an updated systematic review of the literature on the accuracy of screening questionnaires for OSA against polysomnography ( PSG) as the reference test. Using the main databases ( including Medline , Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Scopus) we used a combination of relevant keywords to filter studies published between January 2010 and April 2017. Population-based studies evaluating the accuracy of screening questionnaires for OSA against PSG were included in the review. Thirty-nine studies comprising 18 068 subjects were included. Four screening questionnaires for OSA had been validated in selected studies including the Berlin questionnaire ( BQ) , STOP-Bang Questionnaire ( SBQ) , STOP Questionnaire ( SQ) , and Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS). The sensitivity of SBQ in detecting mild ( apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI) ≥ 5 events/hour) and severe ( AHI ≥ 30 events/hour) OSA was higher compared to other screening questionnaires ( range from 81.08 % to 97.55 % and 69.2 % to 98.7 % , respectively). However , SQ had the highest sensitivity in predicting moderate OSA ( AHI ≥ 15 events/hour; range = 41.3 % to 100 %). SQ and SBQ are reliable tools for screening OSA among sleep clinic patients. Although further validation studies on the screening abilities of these questionnaires on general populations are required.
