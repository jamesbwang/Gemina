  The lateral habenula ( LHb) regulates reward learning and controls the updating of reward-related information. Drugs of abuse have the capacity to hijack the cellular and neurocircuit mechanisms mediating reward learning , forming non-adaptable , compulsive behaviors geared toward obtaining illicit substances. Here , we discuss current findings demonstrating how drugs of abuse alter intrinsic and synaptic LHb neuronal function. Additionally , we discuss evidence for how drug-induced LHb alterations may affect the ability to predict reward , potentially facilitating an addiction-like state. Altogether , we combine
