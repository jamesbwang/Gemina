  Adsorption of volatiles in gaseous phase to activated charcoal strip ( ACS) is one possibility for the extraction and concentration of ignitable liquid residues ( ILRs) from fire debris in arson investigations. Besides liquid extraction using carbon dioxide or hexane , automated thermo-desorption can be used to transfer adsorbed residues to direct analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS). We present a fire debris analysis work-flow with headspace adsorption of volatiles onto ACS and subsequent automated thermo-desorption ( ATD) GC-MS analysis. Only a small portion of the ACS is inserted in the ATD tube for thermal desorption coupled to GC-MS , allowing for subsequent confirmation analysis with another portion of the same ACS. This approach is a promising alternative to the routinely used ACS method with solvent extraction of retained volatiles , and the application to fire debris analysis is demonstrated.
