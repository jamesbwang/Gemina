  Cancer stem cells ( CSCs) play important roles in tumor initiation , metastasis , and progression. They are also mainly responsible for high treatment failure rates. Identification and characterization of CSCs are crucial for facilitating the detection , prevention , or therapy of cancer. Great efforts have been paid to develop an effective method and the ideal method for CSCs research is still in the going. In our study , we created an ultra-low concentration of serum and non-adhesive ( ULCSN) culture system to enrich CSCs from murine lewis lung cancer cell line LL/2 with cell spheres structure and characterize the LL/2 CSCs properties. Their characteristics were investigated through colony formation , spheres formation , chemoresistance , flow cytometry for putative stem cell markers , such as CD133 , CD34 and CD45 , immunofluorescence staining and tumor initiation capacity
