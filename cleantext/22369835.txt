  Functional health status is an important factor not only for determining overall health , but also for measuring risks of adverse events. Our hypothesis is that important functional status data is contained in clinical notes. We found that several categories of phrases related to functional status including diagnoses , activity and care assessments , physical exam , functional scores , assistive equipment , symptoms , and surgical history were important factors. Use of functional health status level terms from our chart review compared to National Surgical Quality Improvement Program determination had varying sensitivities for correct functional status category identification , with 96 % for independent patients , 60 % for partially dependent patients , and 44 % for totally dependent patients. Inter-rater agreement assessing term relevance to functional health status was high at 91 % ( Kappa = 0.74). Functional status-related terms in clinical notes show potential for use in future methodologies for automated detection of functional health status for quality improvement registries and other clinical assessments.
