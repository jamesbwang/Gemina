  Embryonic stem ( ES) cell self-renewal and differentiation is governed by extrinsic signals and intrinsic networks of transcription factors , epigenetic regulators , and post-translation modifications of histones that combinatorially influence the gene expression state of nearby genes. RNA has also been shown to interact with various proteins to regulate chromatin dynamics and gene expression. Chromatin-associated RNA immunoprecipitation ( CARIP) followed by next-generation sequencing ( CARIP-Seq) is a novel method to survey RNAs associated with chromatin proteins , while chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing ( ChIP-Seq) is a powerful genomics technique to map the location of post-translational modification of histones , transcription factors , and epigenetic modifiers on a global-scale in ES cells. Here , we describe methods to perform CARIP-Seq and ChIP-Seq , including library construction for next-generation sequencing , to generate global chromatin-associated RNA and epigenomic maps in ES cells.
