  To evaluate and compare the perception of stressors by nursing students before and after a high-fidelity clinical simulation or conventional laboratory practice class. This is a randomized clinical trial conducted with 52 nursing students. Both groups had theoretical classes about cardiothoracic physical examination , followed by practice class in skill laboratory. In addition , the experimental group took part in a high-fidelity simulation scenario. Stressors were evaluated before and after class , with the application of KEZKAK questionnaire. The experimental group was significantly more worried about six factors related to lack of competence and to interpersonal relationships ( p < 0.05) , while the control group was significantly more worried about being in contact with suffering ( p = 0.0315). The simulation affects students ' perception of stressors and promotes their self-evaluation and critical thinking regarding the responsibility that comes with their learning.
