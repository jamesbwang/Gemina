  Sleep deprivation may cause accidents , and it has deteriorating effects on health. A measurement of postural steadiness by a portable and affordable Nintendo Wii Fit balance<symptom> board can be used to quantify a person 's alertness. At work , people are under the influence of their environment-often other people-that may affect their alertness. This work investigates whether sleep deprivation among people is `` contagious , '' as quantified by sway measures. We measured 21 volunteers ' postural steadiness while alert and sleep deprived. During the measurements , a screen placed in front of the participants showed a footage of either alert or sleep-deprived faces. We found a significant difference between the day time and night time steadiness , but found no effect resulting from watching footage of sleep-deprived people. This finding shows that a posturographic sleepiness tester quantifies physiological sleep deprivation , and is insensitive to the influence of social factors.
