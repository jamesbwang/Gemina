  There is great variability in radiation safety practices in cardiac catheterization laboratories around the world. We performed an international online survey on radiation safety including interventional cardiologists , electrophysiologists , interventional radiologists , and vascular surgeons. A total of 570 responses were received from various geographic locations , including the United States ( 77.9 %) , Asia ( 7.9 %) , Europe ( 6.8 %) , Canada ( 2.8 %) , and Mexico and Central America ( 2.1 %). Most respondents ( 73 %) were interventional cardiologists and 23 % were electrophysiologists , with 14.4 Â± 10.2 years in practice. Most respondents ( 75 %) were not aware of their radiation dose during the past year and 21.2 % had never attended a radiation safety course; 58.9 % are `` somewhat worried '' and 31.5 % are `` very worried '' about chronic radiation exposure. Back pain due to lead use was reported by 43.0 % and radiation-related health complications including cataracts and malignancies were reported by 6.3 %. Only 37.5 % of respondents had an established radiation dose threshold for initiating patient follow-up. When comparing United States operators with the other respondents , the former were more likely to attend radiation safety courses ( P < .001) , wear dosimeters ( P < .001) , know their annual personal radiation exposure ( P < .001) , and have an established patient radiation dose threshold ( P < .001). They were also more likely to use the fluoro store function , under-table shields , leaded glasses , ceiling lead glass , and disposable radiation shields , and were more concerned about the adverse effects of radiation. Radiation safety is of concern to catheterization laboratory personnel , yet there is significant variability in radiation protection practices , highlighting several opportunities for standardization and improvement.
