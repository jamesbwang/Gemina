  Highly active and stable Pt-free electrocatalysts for hydrogen production via water splitting are of great demand for future energy systems. Herein , we report a novel hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) catalyst consisting of rhodium phosphide ( Rh2P) nanoparticles as the core and N-doped carbon ( NC) as the shell ( Rh2P@NC). In a wide pH range , our catalyst not only possesses a small overpotential at 10 mA cm-2 ( ∼ 9 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 , ∼ 46 mV in 1.0 M PBS and ∼ 10 mV in 1.0 M KOH) , but also demonstrates high stability. Importantly , all these performances are far superior to commercial Pt/C catalysts for HER. To the best of our knowledge , this is the highest HER performance reported so far in acidic and basic media. Density functional theory ( DFT) calculations reveal that the introduction of phosphorus can significantly lower the proton adsorption energy of Rh/NC , thereby benefiting surface hydrogen generation. Moreover , this synthetic strategy for Rh2P@NC is also applied to other transition metal phosphides ( TMPs)/ nitrogen-doped carbon heterostructures ( such as Ru2P@NC , Fe2P@NC , WP@NC etc.) with advanced performance toward HER and beyond.
