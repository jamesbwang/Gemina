  In this review , we focus on current trends in the management of male lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS) , defined here as LUTS , namely , storage , voiding , and post-micturition symptoms presumed secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia<disease> ( BPH) , and discuss possible novel approaches toward better care. According to results of a PubMed database search covering the last 10 years and using keywords pertaining to male LUTS , this condition continues to be globally undiagnosed or diagnosed late , partly because of men 's hesitation to seek help for perceived embarrassing problems or problems considered a normal part of aging. In addition , the prevalence of male LUTS is continually increasing because of a constantly aging population. Male LUTS can be bothersome and affect the quality of life ( QoL) and sexual function. Additional effective alternatives for managing this condition need to be identified and incorporated into the current care model. Considering that most male LUTS such as frequency , hesitancy , urgency , and intermittency are easy to self-identify , a self-management approach toward male LUTS is proposed. Limited evidence supports the efficacy of phytotherapies and herbals as self-management options for male LUTS. However , introducing over-the-counter ( OTC) medication with proven efficacy , accompanied by lifestyle and behavioral modifications , may be a promising approach that will encourage more men to treat their symptoms in a timely manner. Formal guidelines , along with appropriate education programs for patients and support from the healthcare community , will be needed to ensure that the promise of this approach is fully materialized.
