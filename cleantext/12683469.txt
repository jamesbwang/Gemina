  Sufficient sleep plays an important role in neurocognitive function , yet , problematic sleep is ubiquitous in the general population. It is also frequently predictive of , and concurrent with , internalizing psychopathologies ( IPs) such as anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> suggesting sleep quality is dimensional and transdiagnostic. Along with problematic sleep , IPs are characterized by negative affectivity , therefore , prominent neurobiological models of internalizing conditions involve the amygdala , a region central to emotion. In resting-state studies ( independent of sleep considerations) , abnormalities in amygdala-frontal functional connectivity are commonly observed suggesting emotion dysregulation may contribute to clinically-relevant phenotypes. In a separate line of research , studies of sleep deprivation , and insomnia disorder suggest sleep loss may alter amygdala-frontal connectivity. Taken together , findings point to shared neurobiology between sleep and emotion systems , however , the impact of sleep quality on the amygdala circuit in anxiety<symptom> or depression<symptom> is unclear. Therefore , we evaluated variance in naturalistic sleep quality on amygdala-based circuity in individuals with and without psychiatric illness. Resting-state fMRI data was collected in 87 un-medicated , treatment-seeking adults diagnosed with a primary anxiety<symptom> disorder (
