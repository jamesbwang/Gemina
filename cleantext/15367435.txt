  Cancer immunotherapy has been revolutionised by drugs that enhance the ability of the immune system to detect and fight tumors. Immune checkpoint therapies that target the programmed death-1 receptor ( PD-1) , or its ligand ( PD-L1) have shown unprecedented rates of durable clinical responses in patients with various cancer types. However , there is still a large fraction of patients that do not respond to checkpoint inhibitors , and the challenge remains to find cellular and molecular cues that could predict which patients would benefit from these therapies. Using a series of qualitative and quantitative methods we show here that PBMCs and platelets from smokers and patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) or lung cancer express and up-regulate PD-L1 independently of tumor stage. Furthermore , treatment with Atezolizumab , a fully humanised monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 , in 4 patients with lung cancer caused a decrease in PD-L1 expression in platelets , which was restored over 20 days. Altogether , our findings reveal the expression of the main therapeutic target in current checkpoint therapies in human platelets and highlight their potential as biomarkers to predict successful therapeutic outcomes.
