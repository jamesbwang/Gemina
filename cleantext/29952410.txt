  Oxytocin might be used therapeutically as an ally to rescue osteopathy resulting from diabetes. However , the in vivo effect of oxytocin on marrow adipogenesis in diabetes remains unknown. In this longitudinal study , we aimed to investigate the protective effects of oxytocin on diabetes-induced marrow adiposity in rabbits using proton MR spectroscopy. Forty-five female New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into controls , diabetes and diabetes treated with oxytocin ( ip , 0.78 mg/kg) for 6 month. Marrow fat fraction ( FF) was determined by proton MR spectroscopy at baseline , 3 and 6 months. Bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum biomarkers , glycolipid metabolism and histological analysis of marrow adipocytes were determined. Oxytocin treatment had positive metabolic effects in diabetic rabbits , which was based on the changes in glucose metabolism , insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles. The diabetic rabbits demonstrated dramatic marrow adiposity in a time-dependent manner; at 3 and 6 months , the FF percentage changes from baseline were 10.1 % and 25.8 % , respectively ( all P < 0.001). Besides , oxytocin treatment significantly reverse FF values and quantitative parameters of marrow adipocyte in diabetic rabbits to levels of naive control rabbits. Oxytocin improved bone formation marker in diabetic rabbits compared to saline group. Also , treatment of diabetic rabbits with oxytocin significantly mitigated bone deterioration when compared with saline-treated diabetic group ( all P < 0.05). Oxytocin appears to alleviate harmful effects of hyperglycemia on marrow adiposity. Proton MR spectroscopy may be a valuable tool , providing complementary information on efficacy assessments.
