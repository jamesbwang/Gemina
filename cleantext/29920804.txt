  To avoid large open surgery using scaffold transplants , small-sized cell carriers are employed to repair complexly shaped tissue defects. However , most cell carriers show poor cell adherences and viability. Therefore , polyhydroxyalkanoate ( PHA) , a natural biopolymer , is used to prepare highly open porous microspheres ( OPMs) of 300-360 µm in diameter , combining the advantages of microspheres and scaffolds to serve as injectable carriers harboring proliferating stem cells. In addition to the convenient injection to a defected tissue , and in contrast to poor performances of OPMs made of polylactides ( PLA OPMs) and traditional less porous hollow microspheres ( PHA HMs) , PHA OPMs present suitable surface pores of 10-60 µm and interconnected passages with an average size of 8.8 µm , leading to a high in vitro cell adhesion of 93.4 % , continuous proliferation for 10 d and improved differentiation of human bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs). PHA OPMs also support stronger osteoblast-regeneration compared with traditional PHA HMs , PLA OPMs , commercial hyaluronic acid hydrogels , and carrier-free hMSCs in an ectopic bone-formation mouse model. PHA OPMs protect cells against stresses during injection , allowing more living cells to proliferate and migrate to damaged tissues. They function like a micro-Noah 's Ark to safely transport cells to a defect tissue.
