  Preoperative pain characteristics in osteoarthritis ( OA) patients may explain persistent pain after total knee replacement ( TKR). Fifty patients awaiting TKR and 22 asymptomatic controls were recruited to evaluate the degree of neuropathic pain symptoms<symptom> and pain sensitisation. OA patients were pain phenotyped into two groups based on the PainDETECT questionnaire: High PainDETECT group ( scores â‰¥ 19) indicating neuropathic pain-like symptoms , Low PainDETECT group ( scores < 19) indicating nociceptive or mixed pain. Cuff algometry assessing pain detection thresholds ( PDT) and pain tolerance ( PTT) was conducted on the lower legs. Temporal summation of pain ( TSP) was assessed using ten sequential cuff stimulations and a von Frey stimulator. Conditioning pain modulation was assessed by cuff pain conditioning on one leg and parallel assessment of PDT on the contralateral leg. Pressure pain<symptom> thresholds ( PPTs) were recorded by pressure handheld algometry local and distant to the knee. Knee pain intensity ( VAS) and pain assessment were collected before and 6 months post-TKR. 30 % of patients demonstrated neuropathic pain-like symptoms ( High PainDETECT group). Facilitated TSP and reduced PPTs distant to the knee were found in High PainDETECT group compared to Low PainDETECT group and healthy controls groups ( p < 0.001). OA patients with High PainDETECT scores had higher postoperative VAS pain scores than the Low PainDETECT patients ( p < 0.0001) and facilitated TSP ( p = 0.022) compared with healthy controls. This study has found that preoperative PainDETECT scores independently predict postoperative pain. Knee OA patients with neuropathic pain like symptoms identified using the PainDETECT questionnaire are most at risk of developing chronic postoperative pain after TKR surgery.
