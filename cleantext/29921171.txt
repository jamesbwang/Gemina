  The Sultanate of Oman faces challenges , like rapid growth of waste generation , which calls for an optimum waste management strategy. Oman has witnessed the production of 1.5 m t of municipal solid waste in 2012 , which is expected to elevate to 1.89 m t in 2030. This rapid increase needs to be tackled to reduce the generation rates along with the environmental impacts. Currently , there are no treatment facilities in Oman other than limited recycling , and therefore dumping waste into the landfill is the only ultimate way to dispose solid waste. Hence , this study is an initiative to improve the waste managing system in Oman by proposing optimum waste-to-energy technology using an analytical hierarchy process , manually and through expect choice software as well. In the present study , the identified important parameters were considered in an analytical hierarchy process model to rank the waste-to-energy technology alternatives. Based on the survey conducted , the most important criteria were environmental and economic , with the local priority vector of 0.400 and 0.277 , respectively. This research concludes that the most suitable waste-to-energy technology for Oman , on the basis of the identified criteria , is anaerobic digestion followed by fermentation and incineration , which will help to reduce the amount of waste , greenhouse gas emissions and developing and maintaining costs of landfills.
