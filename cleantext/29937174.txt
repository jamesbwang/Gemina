  Colonic self-expanding metallic stenting ( SEMS) is widely used for the treatment of malignant colonic obstruction as a bridge to elective surgery. However , the effects of colonic stenting on long-term oncologic outcomes are debatable. This study aimed to compare the long-term oncologic outcomes of preoperative SEMS insertion with those of immediate surgery in patients with obstructing left-sided colorectal cancer. A cohort of consecutive patients who underwent radical surgery for obstructing left-sided colorectal cancer between 2004 and 2011 in five tertiary referral hospitals were analyzed. Long-term survivals were analyzed and adjusted using the inverse probability of treatment weighting method , based on propensity scores , to reduce selection bias. One hundred and nine patients underwent immediate surgery , and 226 underwent stent insertion before surgery. Disease-free survival did not differ significantly in both the unadjusted population ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.063 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.730-1.548; Log-rank , p = 0.746) and the adjusted population ( HR 0.122 , 95 % CI 0.920-1.987; Log-rank , p = 0.122). Overall survival also did not differ significantly in both the unadjusted population ( HR 0.871 , 95 % CI 0.568-1.334; Log-rank , p = 0.526) and the adjusted population ( HR 1.023 , 95 % CI 0.665-1.572; Log-rank , p = 0.916). Defunctioning stoma formation was less in the SEMS insertion group than immediate surgery group ( adjusted , 14.6 % vs. 41.3 % , p < 0.001). The ` bridge to surgery ' strategy using metallic stents was oncologically comparable to immediate surgery in patients with malignant left-sided colorectal obstruction.
