  The brain has a remarkable capacity to recover after lesions<symptom>. However , little is known about compensatory neural adaptations at the systems level. We addressed this question by investigating behavioral and ( correlated) functional changes throughout the cortex that are induced by focal , reversible inactivations. Specifically , monkeys performed a demanding covert spatial attention task while the lateral intraparietal area ( LIP) was inactivated with muscimol and whole-brain fMRI activity was recorded. The inactivation caused LIP-specific decreases in task-related fMRI activity. In addition , these local effects triggered large-scale network changes. Unlike most studies in which animals were mainly passive relative to the stimuli , we observed heterogeneous effects with more profound muscimol-induced increases of task-related fMRI activity in areas connected to LIP , especially FEF. Furthermore , in areas such as FEF and V4 , muscimol-induced changes in fMRI activity correlated with changes in behavioral performance. Notably , the activity changes in remote areas did not correlate with the decreased activity at the site of the inactivation , suggesting that such changes arise via neuronal mechanisms lying in the intact portion of the functional task network , with FEF a likely key player. The excitation-inhibition dynamics unmasking existing excitatory connections across the functional network might initiate these rapid adaptive changes.
