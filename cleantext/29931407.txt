  To compare live birth rates ( LBRs) and multiple birth rates ( MBRs) between elective single-embryo transfer ( eSET) and double-embryo transfer ( DET) in donor oocyte in vitro fertilization ( IVF) treatments in both a cycle-level and clinic-level analysis. Donor oocyte IVF treatments performed by US IVF clinics reporting to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2013-2014 were included in the analysis. Primary outcomes included LBR and MBR. Secondary outcomes included gestational age at delivery ( GA) and birth weight ( BW) of offspring. These outcomes were evaluated on an individual cycle level as well as on the clinic level. In multivariable models , LBR did not change significantly as clinics utilized eSET more frequently. MBR decreased significantly as utilization of eSET increased , from 39 % MBR in clinics that utilized eSET 0-9 % of the time to 7 % MBR in clinics that used eSET 70 % of the time ( P < .0001). Mean BW and GA of IVF-conceived offspring both increased as clinics utilized eSET more frequently ( 2778 to 3185 g ( P < .0001) and 37.5 to 38.5 weeks ( P = .02) for clinics with the lowest and highest eSET utilization , respectively). US IVF clinics utilizing eSET with higher frequencies have clinically comparable LBRs and significantly lower MBRs than clinics with lower-frequency eSET utilization. Mean offspring BW and GA increased with higher eSET utilization , further confirming the improved safety of this practice.
