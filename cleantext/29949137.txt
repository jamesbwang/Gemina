  The purpose of the present study was to explore the mechanism of action of the adipokine chemerin in osteoarthritis ( OA) by means of an in vitro OA model. Primary chondrocytes were isolated from normal rats. The chondrocytes were stimulated with interleukin 1 beta ( IL-1β , 10 μg/L) to establish a model of induced OA. Chemerin was administered to cells of this model. After culture of the chondrocytes in the presence of chemerin for 48 h , the expression of the genes related to OA occurrence and protection , matrix metalloproteinase-1 ( MMP-1) , matrix metalloproteinase-3 ( MMP-3) , and matrix metalloproteinase-13 ( MMP-13) was examined. Western blot was then performed to analyze the phosphorylation of the AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK) proteins in chondrocytes. Stimulation of chondrocytes with IL-1β markedly reduced the proliferative capability of chondrocytes. Chemerin ( 5 μM) also significantly decreased the proliferative capability of chondrocytes. The combined administration of IL-1β and chemerin induced an even greater reduction in the proliferative capability of chondrocytes. Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) results showed that both IL-1β and chemerin reduced the expression of the protective genes in OA ( MMP-1 , MMP-3 , and MMP-13). Also , the stimulation with IL-1β and chemerin significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AKT/ERK in chondrocytes. This adipokine induces changes in the metabolic and proliferative capabilities of chondrocytes by increasing the phosphorylation of AKT/ERK , thereby inducing OA or aggravating the symptoms of OA.
