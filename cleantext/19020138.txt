  The sniffing position has been most commonly used for positioning of the head and neck<symptom> to facilitate tracheal intubation. However , the optimum degree of head elevation for the optimal laryngeal view is not well studied , especially in non-Western countries. The present study was aimed to compare the use of a fixed height pillow versus a customised pillow ( CP) height for head elevation , in terms of glottis visualisation and time required for tracheal intubation. With research and ethics committee approval from the institute , this randomised study was conducted among patients of both sexes aged 16 years or more and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical Status I to IV. A total of 134 patients were randomly allocated into routinely used fixed-sized pillow ( FP) and CP group ( to achieve horizontal alignment of external auditory meatus ( EAM) and sternal notch). Primary and secondary outcomes were Cormack-Lehane ( C-L) grade of glottic visualisation and time required for tracheal intubation , respectively. They were compared using unpaired One hundred and nineteen patients completed the study. Both groups were similar in terms of demographic and external airway measurements. The mean ± standard deviation height of pillow required in Group CP was 6.26 ± 0.97 cm. Group FP had C-L Grade 3 view more often than Group CP ( 28.33 % vs. 13.56 %). In patients with modified Mallampati ( MMP) Grade ≥ 3 , the C-L grades and time required for intubation were both significantly lower in group CP. The time required for tracheal intubation was significantly lower in group CP ( Customising pillow for head elevation to horizontally align the EAM and the sternal notch gives better glottic visualisation and intubating conditions in patients with higher MMP grades.
