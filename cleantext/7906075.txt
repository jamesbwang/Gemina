  Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD) is a highly prevalent disease with a substantial medical need for new and more efficacious treatments. The Nitric Oxide ( NO) , soluble guanylyl cyclase ( sGC) , cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP) signaling cascade regulates various kidney functions. cGMP directly influences renal blood flow , renin secretion , glomerular function , and tubular exchange processes. Downregulation of NO/sGC/cGMP signaling results in severe kidney pathologies such as CKD. Therefore , treatment strategies aiming to maintain or increase cGMP might have beneficial effects for the treatment of progressive kidney diseases. Within this article , we review the NO/sGC/cGMP signaling cascade and its major pharmacological intervention sites. We specifically focus on the currently known effects of cGMP on kidney function parameters. Finally , we summarize the preclinical evidence for kidney protective effects of NO-donors , PDE inhibitors , sGC stimulators , and sGC activators.
