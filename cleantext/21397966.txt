  Boron neutron capture therapy ( BNCT) is a binary radiotherapeutic modality based on the nuclear capture and fission reactions that occur when the stable isotope , boron-10 , is irradiated with neutrons to produce high energy alpha particles. This review will focus on tumor-targeting boron delivery agents that are an essential component of this binary system. Two low molecular weight boron-containing drugs currently are being used clinically , boronophenylalanine ( BPA) and sodium borocaptate ( BSH). Although they are far from being ideal , their therapeutic efficacy has been demonstrated in patients with high grade gliomas , recurrent tumors of the head and neck region , and a much smaller number with cutaneous and extra-cutaneous melanomas. Because of their limitations , great effort has been expended over the past 40 years to develop new boron delivery agents that have more favorable biodistribution and uptake for clinical use. These include boron-containing porphyrins , amino acids , polyamines , nucleosides , peptides , monoclonal antibodies , liposomes , nanoparticles of various types , boron cluster compounds and co-polymers. Currently , however , none of these have reached the stage where there is enough convincing data to warrant clinical biodistribution studies. Therefore , at present the best way to further improve the clinical efficacy of BNCT would be to optimize the dosing paradigms and delivery of BPA and BSH , either alone or in combination , with the hope that future research will identify new and better boron delivery agents for clinical use.
