  Waterpipe smoking is an ancient method of tobacco smoking practiced worldwide. There is a common belief that waterpipe smoking is a safer alternative to cigarette , but many studies showed that some toxicants were associated with cancer risk , significantly higher in waterpipe smoking. Thus , this study aimed to evaluate the status of waterpipe smoker 's buccal cells and its cancer risk using the buccal micronucleus cytome test. Forty waterpipe smokers ( noncigarette smokers) were recruited and paired by gender , age and alcoholic habits with 40 control subjects. One-thousand cells from each individual were analysed and the number of pyknotic cells ( PYC) , karyolitic cells ( KYL) , karyorrhetic cells ( KHC) , condensed chromatin ( CC) , binucleated cells ( BN) , basal cells ( BC) , nuclear buds ( NBUD) and differentiated cells ( DIFF) were counted. Additionally , 2000 differentiated cells were analysed counting micronucleated cells ( MNi) and nuclear buds. We observed an increasing
