  Objective Hearing loss following temporal bone ( TB) fracture may result from direct transection of the middle and inner ear. The pathophysiology of hearing loss due to head injury without TB fracture , however , is not well understood. Few reports describe otopathologic findings. Herein , we investigate the pathologic findings of patients who sustained a head injury without evidence of a TB fracture. Study Design Otopathology study. Setting Otopathology laboratory. Subjects Subjects with a history of head injury without TB fracture. Methods The TBs of patients with head injury were evaluated by light microscopy. Inner ear anatomy was evaluated , including counts of spiral ganglion cells ( SGCs) , hair cells , pillar cells , atrophy of the stria vascularis , and the presence of endolymphatic hydrops. SGC counts were compared with those of historical age-matched controls. Results All cases ( N = 6 TBs) had evidence of inner ear pathology. Of the 6 cases , 2 ( 33 %) had severe<symptom> loss<symptom> of hair cells in all 3 turns of the cochlea , and 4 ( 67 %) cases demonstrated moderate to severe<symptom> loss<symptom> at the basal turn of the cochlea. Four cases had scattered atrophy of the stria vascularis , and 3 ( 50 %) had cochlear hydrops. The number of total SGCs was decreased , with an average 53 % loss ( range , 25 % -79 %) as compared with controls. The SGC count loss was evenly distributed along Rosenthal 's canal. Conclusions Patients with a history of head injury without TB fracture demonstrate inner ear pathology. Further studies are necessary to determine if otopathology findings are directly attributable to trauma.
