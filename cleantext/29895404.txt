  The commercial Rapid Polymyxin NP test was evaluated to detect colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. A total of 223 enterobacterial isolates corresponding to 136 resistant ( including 38 MCR-like producers) , 19 heteroresistant , and 78 colistin-susceptible isolates were tested. The test was performed according to the manufacturer 's instruction , and the color of the wells was read after 2 and 3 hours of incubation. The results were compared with those of the homemade Rapid Polymyxin NP test , and manual broth microdilution according to EUCAST guidelines was used as the reference method to determine the performance of the test. Excellent performance of the commercial Rapid Polymyxin NP test was found with a very major error rate , a major error rate , a sensitivity , and a specificity of 1.9 % , 5.1 % , 98.1 % , and 94.9 % , respectively. The performance of the homemade Polymyxin NP test was similar , with a slightly better value for the very major error ( 1.2 %).
