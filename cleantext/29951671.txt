  We report the preparation of hierarchically porous polymers containing fully interconnected and controlled micro- , meso- , and macropores , where a hyper-cross-linked microporous polymer skeleton forms a reticulating mesoporous wall that supports a highly porous macropore framework. These materials provide high specific surface area and > 90 % porosity , useful for rapid sorption of organic molecules.
