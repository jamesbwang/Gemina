  This study aimed to characterize a commercial lamb finishing system using animals of undefined breed from production to slaughter by analyzing performance , carcass traits , yield of commercial cuts , and the quality and meat acceptance of different slaughter groups , as to evaluate whether this system provides the market with a standardized product. The lots were not homogeneous for yield of commercial cuts and performance and morphometric traits evaluated in vivo. The groups were heterogeneous to 75 % of the 13 carcass traits evaluated , among them , hot and cold carcass weights , hot and cold carcass yields , carcass grade finishing and biological yield. There was also no uniformity for the proportion of non-carcass components , morphometry of carcass , visual appraisals , and loin traits. On the other hand , homogeneity was achieved in physico-chemical and sensory traits , except for hardness and proportion of saturated , monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. We conclude that the commercial finishing system with the use of undefined crossbred lambs does not produce carcass and cuts standardized to the market.
