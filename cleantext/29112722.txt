  There is limited information on the roles of different age groups in propagating pertussis<disease> outbreaks , and on the impact of vaccination on pertussis<disease> transmission in the community. The relative roles of different age groups in propagating the 2012 pertussis<disease> outbreak in Wisconsin were evaluated using the relative risk ( RR) statistic that measures the change in the group 's proportion among all detected cases before vs after the epidemic peak. The impact of vaccination in different age groups against infection ( that is potentially different from the protective effect against detectable disease) was evaluated using the odds ratios ( ORs) , within each age group , for being vaccinated vs undervaccinated before vs after the outbreak 's peak. The RR statistic suggests that children aged 13-14 years played the largest relative role during the outbreak 's ascent ( with estimates consistent across the 3 regions in Wisconsin that were studied) , followed by children aged 7-8 , 9-10 , and 11-12 years. Young children and older teenagers and adults played more limited relative roles during the outbreak. Results of the vaccination status analysis for the fifth dose of DTaP ( for children aged 7-8 years: OR , 0.44; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.23-0.86; for children aged 9-10 years: OR , 0.51; 95 % CI , 0.27-0.95); and for Tdap for children aged 13-14 years ( OR , 0.38 , 95 % CI , 0.16-0.89) are consistent with protective effect against infection. While our epidemiological findings for the fifth dose of DTaP and for Tdap are consistent with protective effect against infection , further studies , including those estimating vaccine effectiveness against infection/transmission to others particularly for pertussis<disease> vaccines for adolescents , are needed to evaluate the impact of vaccination on the spread of pertussis<disease> in the community.
