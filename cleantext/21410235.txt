  Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor ( BPTI) is a 58-residue protein that is stabilized by three disulfide bonds at positions 5-55 , 14-38 and 30-51. Widely studied for about 50 years , BPTI represents a folding model for many disulfide-rich proteins. In the study described below , we replaced the solvent exposed 14-38 disulfide bond with a methylene thioacetal bridge in an attempt to arrest the folding pathway of the protein at its two well-known intermediates , N ' and N *. The modified protein was expected to be unable to undergo the rate-determining step in the widely accepted BPTI folding mechanism: the opening of the 14-38 disulfide bond followed by rearrangements that leads to the native state , N. Surprisingly , instead of halting BPTI folding at N ' and N * , we uncovered a hidden pathway involving a direct reaction between the N * intermediate and the oxidizing reagent glutathione ( GSSG) to form the disulfide-mixed intermediate N *- SG , which spontaneously folds into N. On the other hand , N ' was unable to fold into N. In addition , we found that the methylene thioacetal bridge enhances BPTI stability while fully maintaining its structure and biological function. These findings suggest a general strategy for enhancing protein stability without compromising on function or structure , suggesting potential applications for future therapeutic protein production.
