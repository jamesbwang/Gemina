  Genome and other data are already being used in areas including cancer and rare diseases. Data-sharing and secondary uses are likely to become much broader and far more extensive; thus , obtaining proper consent for these new uses of data is an important issue. Obtaining consent through online methods may be an option to overcome the problems associated with one-off , paper-based informed consent. When the process of obtaining consent takes place remotely , authentication must be assured. Patients may also choose to store some of their own information online , such as genetic information , and allow healthcare professionals to access this data. In this health information transfer and exchange process , it is vital that anyone accessing this information be correctly authenticated to protect patients ' privacy. In this article , we first clarified that authentication has two roles: i.e. , not only to prevent impersonation but also to prove intent , which is a vital step to ensure that medical research and health information exchange are conducted ethically. We then set out methods of authentication. As a result , we were able to make suggestions about the requirements for authentication and a possible method of authentication for these purposes. We considered problems of biometrics and recommended two-factor authentication without biometrics as a workable solution. However , three-factor authentication including biometrics seems likely to be used once biometrics become more common.
