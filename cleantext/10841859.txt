  Several competing priorities with health and development sector currently deter research , and as a result of which evidence does not drive policy- or decision-making. There is limited operational research ( OR) within the India 's National Tobacco Control Programme , as it is in other middle- and low-income countries , primarily due to limited capacity and skills in undertaking OR and lack of dedicated funding. Few models of OR have been developed to meet the needs of different settings; however , they were found to be costly and time-consuming. To elucidate a cost-effective and less resource arduous training model for building capacity in OR focused on tobacco control. This 5 1/2- day partly funded course enrolled 15 participants across the country and nine facilitators. The facilitator-participants interactions were initiated 2 weeks before the course , which enabled them to develop possible research questions and a plan for data analysis. This article presents the new OR model along with experiences of the participants which will provide useful insights on lessons learned for planning similar courses in the future. While we faced several challenges in the process and the outputs were modest , several lessons were learned which will be instrumental in the future courses that we are planning to conduct. This low cost and less time intensive model can be applied in similar settings across range of public health issues.
