  The Berg Balance<symptom> Scale ( BBS) is often used in clinical practice to predict falls in the older adults. However , there is no consensus in research regarding its ability to predict falls. To verify whether the BBS can predict falls risk in older adults. Manual and electronic searches ( Medline , EMBASE , CINAHL , Ageline , Lilacs , Web of Science , Cochrane Library and PEDro) were conducted using blocks of words ( older adults , falls , BBS , study design) and their synonyms , with no language restrictions and published since 1989. Prognostic studies or clinical trials were used to assess the BBS and falls history. In this narrative synthesis , two independent assessors extracted data from articles and a third reviewer provided consensus , in case of disagreement. The methodological quality was assessed using the Quality In Prognosis Studies tool. 1047 studies were found and 8 studies were included in this review. The mean BBS score was high , regardless of the history of falls. Three studies presented cut-off scores for BBS , ranging from 45 to 51 points. Two studies reported a difference in the BBS score between fallers and non-fallers. Studies presented low to moderate risk of bias. Unfeasible to conduct a meta-analysis due the heterogeneity of included studies. The evidence to support the use of BBS to predict falls is insufficient , and should not be used alone to determine the risk of falling in older adults. PROSPERO CRD42016032309.
