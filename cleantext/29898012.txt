  Adverse reactions associated with prick tests are rare but may be present as serious systemic reactions. A 38-year-old female nursing technician complained of three episodes of anaphylaxis in one year , all in the workplace. To investigate latex allergy , the patient underwent the prick test with latex , and immediately developed a rash<symptom> , itchy skin , hoarseness<symptom> , dyspnea<symptom> and dry<symptom> cough<symptom>. Her condition improved promptly after appropriate measures were established for controlling her anaphylaxis. The skin test must be performed under medical supervision , since complications that can lead to life-threatening reactions , if support measures are not readily implemented , have been attributed to this test.
