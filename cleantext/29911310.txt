  Through mimicking both the chiral and energy transfer in an artificial self-assembled system , not only was chiral transfer realized but also a dual upconverted and downconverted energy transfer system was created that emit circularly polarized luminescence. The individual chiral Ï€-gelator can self-assemble into a nanofiber exhibiting supramolecular chirality and circularly polarized luminescence ( CPL). In the presence of an achiral sensitizer Pd
