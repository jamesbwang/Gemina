  Ecological assemblages are inherently uneven , with numerically dominant species contributing disproportionately to ecosystem services. Marked biodiversity change due to growing pressures on the world 's ecosystems is now well documented. However , the hypothesis that dominant species are becoming relatively more abundant has not been tested. We examined the prediction that the dominance structure of contemporary communities is shifting , using a meta-analysis of 110 assemblage timeseries. Changes in relative and absolute dominance were evaluated with mixed and cyclic-shift permutation models. Our analysis uncovered no evidence of a systematic change in either form of dominance , but established that relative dominance is preserved even when assemblage size ( total
