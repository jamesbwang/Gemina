  There are over 40 autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias<symptom> ( SCAs) now identified. In this chapter we delineate the phenotypes of SCAs 1-44 and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy ( DRPLA) and highlight the clinical and genetic features of the well characterised SCAs in detail in the main section of the chapter , along with their frequency and age at onset. We have included a section on the key phenotypic features of rare spinocerebellar ataxias<symptom> and discuss rare and unusual presentations and genetic mechanisms of the ataxias<symptom> and show differences between adult and paediatric presentations. We look at unusual mechanisms where knowledge is evolving in some dominant ataxias<symptom>. For ease of reference we have tabulated historical aspects of the ataxias<symptom> , major neurological diagnostic features , ataxias<symptom> with predominant paediatric and infantile onset and list recognisable nerve conduction features. We comment on the anti-sense ataxia<symptom> gene mechanisms and we discuss potential developments including exome sequencing and potential therapeutic options. A gene table listing all of the identified SCAs and DRPLA is also included with key references and gene locations and symbols with OMIM reference numbers for further reading.
