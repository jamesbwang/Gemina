  This study was aimed at evaluating the anesthetic success rates in various regions of soft tissue after inferior alveolar nerve ( IAN) block and comparing the success rates of soft tissue anesthesia with those of pulpal anesthesia to find correlations. Fifty-nine dental students received an IAN block injection. A total of four test sites were used for soft tissue anesthesia using a pressure algometer ( PA): the corner of the lower lip vermilion border ( LL); the buccal-attached gingiva of the lateral incisor ( BGI) , the molar ( BGM) , and the lingual gingiva ( LG). The lateral incisor ( LI) and the first molar ( M1) were evaluated for pulpal anesthesia using an electric pulp tester. To evaluate whether soft tissue anesthesia can be an indicator of pulpal anesthesia , the positive predictive value ( PPV) and negative predictive value ( NPV) were calculated. The highest success rate for soft tissue anesthesia was seen on the LG ( 93.9 %) , followed by LL ( 79.6 %) , BGI ( 53.1 %) , and BGM ( 14.3 %). The PPVs of LL for the M1 and Ll were 74.4 and 59.0 %. The NPVs for the M1 and LI were much higher in the LL ( 90.0 and 100 % , respectively) than in the BGI ( 56.5 and 69.6 % , respectively). The highest success rate was found in the LG. Lip numbness was not an indicator of pulpal anesthesia of M1 and LI. However , if the LL was not anesthetized , the probabilities of failed pulpal anesthesia were very high in the LI and M1. The clinicians need to consider not doing an additional lingual nerve block after IAN block.
