  Mineral oils ( such as paraffinum liquidum or white oil) , which consist of mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons ( MOSH) and mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons ( MOAH) , are widely applied in various consumer products such as medicines and cosmetics. Contamination of food with mineral oil may occur by migration of mineral oil containing products from packaging materials , or during the food production process , as well as by environmental contamination during agricultural production. Considerable analytical interest was initiated by the potential adverse health effects , especially carcinogenic effects of some aromatic hydrocarbons. This article reviews the history of mineral oil analysis , starting with gravimetric and photometric methods , followed by on-line-coupled liquid chromatography with gas chromatography and flame ionization detection ( LC-GC-FID) , which still is considered as gold standard for MOSH-MOAH analysis. Comprehensive tables of applications in the fields of cosmetics , foods , food contact materials , and living organisms are provided. Further methods including GCxGC-MS methods are reviewed , which may be suitable for confirmation of LC-GC-FID results and identification of compound classes. As alternative to chromatography , nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR) spectroscopy has recently been suggested for MOSH-MOAH analysis , especially with the possibility of detecting only the toxicologically relevant aromatic rings. Furthermore , NMR may offer potential as rapid screening especially with low-field instruments usable for raw material control.
