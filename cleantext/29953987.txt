  Etoposide ( VP16) is a topoisomerase II inhibitor and has been used for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C ( XPC) protein is a DNA damage recognition factor in nucleotide excision repair and involved in regulating NSCLC cell proliferation and viability. Heat shock<symptom> protein 90 ( Hsp90) is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone that is responsible for the stabilization and maturation of many oncogenic proteins. In this study , we report whether Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-AAG) enhanced etoposide-induced cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells through modulating the XPC expression. We found that etoposide increased XPC expression in an AKT activation manner in 2 squamous cell carcinoma H1703 and H520 cells. Knockdown of XPC using siRNA or inactivation of AKT by pharmacological inhibitor PI3K inhibitor ( LY294002) enhanced the cytotoxic effects of etoposide. In contrast , enforced expression of XPC cDNA or AKT-CA ( a constitutively active form of AKT) reduced the cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of etoposide. Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG enhanced cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition of etoposide in NSCLC cells , which were associated with the downregulation of XPC expression and inactivation of AKT. Our findings suggested that the Hsp90 inhibition induced XPC downregulation involved in enhancing the etoposide-induced cytotoxicity in H1703 and H520 cells.
