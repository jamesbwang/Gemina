  This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) was carried out to determine the effect of melatonin supplementation on the inflammatory markers among individuals with metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) and related disorders. We searched the following databases up to March 2018: PubMed , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Web of Science , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Three reviewers independently assessed study eligibility , extracted data , and evaluated risk of bias of included primary studies. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran 's Q test and I-square ( I Six trials of 317 potential reports were identified to be suitable for our meta-analysis. The pooled results using random effects model indicated that melatonin supplementation significantly reduced C-reactive protein ( CRP) ( SMD =- 1.80; 95 % CI- 3.27 ,- 0.32; P = 0.01; I In summary , the current meta-analysis showed the promising effect of melatonin administration on reducing CRP and IL-6 , but not TNF-Î± levels among patients with MetS and related disorders. Additional prospective studies are recommended using higher supplementation doses and longer intervention period.
