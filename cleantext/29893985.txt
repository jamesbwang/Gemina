  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cardiogenetic disease affecting 1/500- 1/1 000 individuals. Dyspnea<symptom> is common but chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , dizziness<symptom> or fainting may also cause considerable limitation for the patient. The diagnosis can be suspected from ECG. Echocardiography confirms hypertrophy of at least 15 mm , usually in the septum. If the obstruction of the outflow tract is severe , myectomy or alcohol ablation can relieve symptoms. Genetic evaluation of family members is advisable. To reduce symptoms , betablockers are used; verapamil or disopyramide are alternatives. Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> is often prevalent and requires special attention concerning anticoagulation and rhythm or rate control. An end-stage heart<symptom> failure<symptom> warrants advanced treatment options such as cardiac resynchronization therapy , ventricular assist devices or heart transplant. Sudden cardiac death is unpredictable and evaluation of risk markers is important to identify potential candidates for an implantable defibrillator.
