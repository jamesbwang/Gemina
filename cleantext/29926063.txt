  Serotonin ( 5-hydroxtryptamine , 5-HT) , one of the central neurotransmitters , is the most important modulator for emotion regulation , sensory processing , cognitive control , etc.. The serotonergic neurons are limited in amount and mainly distributed in the dorsal raphe nucleus ( DR) and the median raphe nucleus ( MR) in the midline of the brain stem. Previous studies mainly focused on the function of 5-HT neurons in the DR , but little is known about 5-HT neurons in MR. In the present study , with Pet1-Cre transgenic mice and DREADDs technology , we specifically activated or silenced 5-HT neurons in the MR , and aimed to explore their roles in anxiety<symptom>- and depressive-like behaviors. The results showed that silencing 5-HT neurons in the MR decreased anxiety-like behaviors in the open field and elevated plus maze tasks. Inhibition of 5-HT neurons in the MR decreased depressive-like behaviors in the sucrose preference and forced swim test , while activation of 5-HT neurons in the MR enhanced depressive-like behaviors in the sucrose preference test. These results suggest that the 5-HT neurons in the MR play a key role in regulating anxiety<symptom>- and depression-like behaviors.
