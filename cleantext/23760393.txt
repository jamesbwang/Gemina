  We aimed to identify biomarkers to guide the decision to add selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRI) to psychological treatment for social anxiety<symptom> disorder ( SAD). Forty-eight patients with SAD underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and collection of clinical and demographic variables before treatment with cognitive-behavioural therapy , combined on a double-blind basis with either escitalopram or placebo for 9 weeks. Pre-treatment neural reactivity to aversive faces in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC) , but not clinical/demographic variables , moderated clinical outcomes. Cross-validated individual-level predictions accurately identified 81 % of responders/non-responders. Dorsal ACC reactivity is thus a potential biomarker for SAD treatment selection. None.
