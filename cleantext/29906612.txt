  Retinal degenerative diseases are a major cause of morbidity in modern society because visual impairment significantly decreases the quality of life of patients. A significant challenge in treating retinal degenerative diseases is their genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. However , despite this diversity , many of these diseases share a common endpoint involving death of light-sensitive photoreceptors. Identifying common pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to photoreceptor death in these diverse diseases may lead to a unifying therapy for multiple retinal diseases that would be highly innovative and address a great clinical need. Because the retina and photoreceptors , in particular , have immense metabolic and energetic requirements , many investigators have hypothesized that metabolic dysfunction may be a common link unifying various retinal degenerative diseases. Here , we discuss a new area of research examining the role of NAD
