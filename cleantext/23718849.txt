  This study was conducted to investigate the effects of an experimental bacterial keratitis<disease> model on the corneal collagen cross-linking treatment ( CXL) , and also to compare topical antibiotic treatment with the combined treatment. The study involved 40 young adult female Sprague Dawley rats , which had a 2 mm scraped defect of the central corneal epithelium in both eyes. The rats were divided into two equal groups. The first group was inoculated in both eyes with standard In the treatment , which compared baselines in all groups before treatment , the diameter of keratitis<disease> infiltrations , corneal clouding , and corneal swab samples were obtained from the reduction in reproduction. The results were statistically significant ( p < 0.01). Keratitis<disease> infiltration groups were conducted on the seventh day for Groups 1C and 1D according to Group 1B , whilst Groups 2A , 2C and 2D were conducted according to Group 2B , which showed a significant statistical reduction ( p < 0.01). On the seventh day , focal groups were conducted in corneal clouding Group 1D according to Group 1B and in Groups 2A , 2C and 2D according to Group 2B , which revealed a significant statistical reduction ( p < 0.01). On the seventh day , reproduction in culture was obtained from corneal swab samples in Groups 1C and 1D according to Group 1B; in Groups 1C and 1D according to Group 1A; in Groups 2A , 2C and 2D according to Group 2B; and in Group 2C according to Group 2A , where a significant statistical reduction was observed ( p < 0.01). The clinical and microbiological efficacy of the CXL treatment is evaluated in our study. In accordance with the conclusion reached an effective reduction in the density and severity of ( infection) , occurred as a result of CXL treatment , CXL treatment combined with topical antibiotic treatment and topical antibiotic treatment of
