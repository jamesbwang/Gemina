  Colistin is currently regarded as one of the ` last-resort ' antibiotics used for the treatment of critical infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Recently , there have been numerous reports of the emergence of a transferable plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene , mcr-1 in patients , animals , food , and environment. Here , we characterize the support of colistin resistance among environmental isolates collected from seawater of Algiers coast. Our study was carried out on 246 isolates resistant to colistin ( MIC > 2 μg/L). The mcr-1 gene was identified in only two isolates; M49 and M78. The two strains were identified as Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and were non-susceptible to amoxicillin , ticarcillin , piperacillin , gentamicin , nalidixic acid , tigecycline , tetracycline , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and colistin. For the latter , isolates M49 and M78 showed MIC values of 4 μg/mL and 8 μg/mL , respectively. Only the strain M78 was intermediary resistant to tobramycin. The two E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strains belonged to two different sequence types ( STs): ST23 for M49 and ST115 for M78. The mcr-1 gene was present on a non-conjugative plasmid in the two strains.
