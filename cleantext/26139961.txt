  Biliary leakage is a challenging complication when managing the bile duct strictures. The etiology of benign strictures of the biliary tree may have different etiologies but iatrogenic is the most common , with relevant increase after introduction of laparoscopic procedures. Interventional radiologist plays a key role , both in diagnosis and treatment of biliary strictures and leakage. We report on a case of a 39-year-old woman affected by abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> and jaundice after laparoscopic cholecystectomy; jaundice was caused by surgical clipping of the common bile duct. The combined management by surgeon and interventional radiologist , consisting of removal of surgical clip and percutaneous management of biliary leakage , successfully resolved the leakage with clinical success.
