  Prevention of parent-to-child transmission ( PPTCT) program aims at reduction of HIV<pathogen> transmission through vertical route. Although medical intervention reduces chance of HIV<pathogen> transmission substantially , several demographic factors are often contributory. Minimum literacy is required for HIV-infected individuals to understand the course of medicine and to ensure compliance to the treatment which may have impact on vertical transmission. The objective of this study is to analyze relationship between maternal education and possibility of her babies to get HIV<pathogen> infected. A retrospective cohort study was carried out through analysis of secondary data during the period from April 13 to September 16 from all stand-alone integrated counseling and testing centers in West Bengal. A total number of 326 HIV-exposed babies , whose 6 HIV<pathogen> positivity among HIV-exposed babies was found to be 6.67 % whose mothers were illiterate as compared to 5.55 % whose mothers were literate up to primary standard and 3.93 % whose mothers were educated up to secondary standard. HIV<pathogen> positivity among the exposed babies whose mothers studied higher secondary standard or above showed zero HIV<pathogen> positivity. Chi-square was done to ascertain statistical significance but result was inconclusive although the trend shows increasing chance of HIV-exposed babies to get infected with decreasing literacy. Maternal literacy status favorably influences vertical transmission of
