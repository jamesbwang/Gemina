  Spherical particles ( SPs) generated by thermally denatured tobacco mosaic virus ( TMV) coat protein can act as an adjuvant , as they are able to enhance the magnitude and longevity of immune responses to different antigens. Here , the toxicity of TMV SPs was assessed prior to it being offered as a universal safe adjuvant for the development of vaccine candidates. The evaluation included nonclinical studies of a local tolerance following the single administration of TMV SPs , and of the local and systemic effects following repeated administrations of TMV SPs. These were conducted in mice , rats and rabbits. General health status , haematology and blood chemistry parameters were monitored on a regular basis. Also , reproductive and development toxicity were studied. No significant signs of toxicity were detected following single or repeated administrations of the adjuvant ( TMV SPs). The absence of toxicological effects following the injection of TMV SPs is promising for the further development of recombinant vaccine candidates with TMV SPs as an adjuvant.
