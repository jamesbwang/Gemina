  Cross-sectional study. There is a knowledge gap on urinary incontinence in women with spinal cord injury. Hence , the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and conditions associated with urinary incontinence in this population. Clinic for Spinal Cord Injuries , Rigshospitalet , Denmark. Women with a spinal cord injury between September 1999 and August 2016 , who attended a consultation in our clinic during August 2010-August 2016 , were included. Data were obtained from an electronic medical record database , in which standardized questionnaires were filled out by the treating physician during the consultation. Data regarding the injury , bladder function , mobility , spousal/cohabitation status , and quality of life were obtained from the most recently filled-out questionnaires. Of the 609 included women , 299 ( 49 %) experienced urinary incontinence: 27 % daily , 13 % weekly , and 9 % monthly. The odds of urinary incontinence increased if the woman used a wheelchair permanently ( odds ratio ( OR) 2.16 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.24-3.77) , needed aids to walk ( OR 1.73 , 95 % CI 1.08-2.76) , and if the woman 's spousal/cohabitation status was unmarried/not living with a partner ( OR 1.60 , 95 % CI 1.11-2.32). Conversely , the odds of urinary incontinence decreased if the woman used an indwelling catheter ( OR 0.35 , 95 % CI 0.18-0.67) compared with normal bladder-emptying method. Finally , incontinence was associated with decreased quality of life on the general , physical , and emotional domain. Urinary incontinence is a prevalent problem in women with spinal cord injury , affecting half of the population , and it is associated with impaired mobility , unmarried/non-cohabiting status , and reduced quality of life.
