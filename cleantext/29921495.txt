  ADAM23 , a member of the disintegrin and metalloprotease ( ADAM) family , has been reported to be expressed in several types of tumours. Nevertheless , the exact role of ADAM23 in epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate ADAM23 expression in EOC and evaluate its clinicopathological and prognostic significance. Immunohistochemistry ( IHC) , western blot and real-time PCR ( RT-PCR) were used to analyse ADAM23 expression in 133 EOC , 42 benign ovarian tumour and 35 healthy control samples. Moreover , we evaluated the expression of ADAM23 in both public database ( Oncomine and Kaplan-Meier plotter). The association between ADAM23 expression and various clinicopathological parameters was analysed. The levels of ADAM23 mRNA and protein expression were significantly lower in EOC tissues than in corresponding control tissues and benign ovarian tumours , verifying results from the Oncomine databases. The loss of ADAM23 expression was significantly correlated with an advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics ( FIGO) stage and lymph node metastasis. The IHC data in the EOC samples correlated with the RT-PCR data. Furthermore , patients with low ADAM23 expression had shorter progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) than patients with high ADAM23 expression. The multivariate analysis indicated that ADAM23 was an independent predictor in patients with EOC. Our results demonstrate that ADAM23 expression is likely involved in the progression of EOC and may provide potential diagnostic and prognostic information regarding EOC.
