  Malignant pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas affect a very small percentage of the general population. A substantial number of these patients have a hereditary predisposition for the disease and consequently , bear the risk of developing these tumors throughout their entire lives. It is , however , unclear why some patients with no hereditary predisposition develop these tumors , which frequently share a similar molecular phenotype with their hereditary counterparts. Both hereditary and sporadic tumors usually appear at an early age , and affected people often die before reaching their expected lifespans. Unfortunately , there is currently no systemic therapy approved for patients with this orphan disease. Therefore , pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are very challenging malignancies. The recognition of genetic and molecular abnormalities responsible for the development of these tumors as well as the identification of effective therapies for other malignancies that share a similar pathogenesis is leading to the development of exciting clinical trials. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors , radiopharmaceutical agents , and immunotherapy are currently under evaluation in prospective clinical trials.
