  Objective This meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis ( TSA) was performed to determine whether low-dose corticosteroids ( LDCs) can improve survival or shock<symptom> reversal from septic shock<symptom> in adults. Methods A literature search was performed using several databases ( Medline , Cochrane Library , Embase , and Chinese Biological Medical Database) until 23 October 2017. The systematic review was registered in PROSPERO. Results Nine randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) ( n = 1182) were included. LDC intervention improved 7-day shock<symptom> reversal compared with the control group ( relative risk , 1.36; TSA-adjusted 95 % confidence interval , 1.20-1.54). LDCs had no statistically significant effects on gastrointestinal bleeding or superinfection. LDCs did not reduce 28-day mortality from septic shock<symptom> ( relative risk , 0.96; TSA-adjusted 95 % confidence interval , 0.74-1.24). The TSA indicated that RCTs of about 3000 patients would be needed to draw definitive conclusions; similar results were obtained in a subgroup analysis of nonresponders. Conclusions LDCs improve 7-day shock<symptom> reversal. However , whether LDCs improve 28-day survival from septic shock<symptom> in adults remains unclear. The results of well-designed larger RCTs are needed.
