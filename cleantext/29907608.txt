  To evaluate the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation ( nVNS; gammaCore; electroCore , LLC , Basking Ridge , NJ) for the acute treatment of migraine in a multicenter , double-blind , randomized , sham-controlled trial. A total of 248 participants with episodic migraine with/without aura were randomized to receive nVNS or sham within 20 minutes from pain onset. Participants were to repeat treatment if pain had not improved in 15 minutes. nVNS ( n = 120) was superior to sham ( n = 123) for pain freedom at 30 minutes ( 12.7 % vs 4.2 %; This randomized sham-controlled trial supports the abortive efficacy of nVNS as early as 30 minutes and up to 60 minutes after an attack. Findings also suggest effective pain relief , tolerability , and practicality of nVNS for the acute treatment of episodic migraine. NCT02686034. This study provides Class I evidence that for patients with an episodic migraine , nVNS significantly increases the probability of having mild<symptom> pain<symptom> or being pain-free 2 hours poststimulation ( absolute difference 13.2 %).
