  This study aimed to investigate the effect of inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway on the radiosensitivity of breast cancer cells. Human breast cancer cell lines ( MCF-7 and T47D) were selected and treated with radiation of different doses. Cells were treated with Gamma secretase inhibitor ( GSI) to analyze the effects of GSI on the Notch signaling , which were detected by Immunofluorescence assay , RT-qPCR , and Western blot analysis. Besides , Transwell assay , Scratch test , colony formation assay , MTT assay , and flow cytometry were conducted to show the effects of GSI on the invasion and migration , survival fraction , cell viability , and apoptosis of MCF-7 and T47D cells after radiation therapy. Moreover , cell transfection with a dominant negative mutant of RBPJ , the key transcription factor of Notch signaling pathway , were also applied to show the inhibition of Notch signaling pathway. Initially , we found that the 4 Gy radiation activated Notch signaling pathway , and enhanced the invasion and migration of MCF-7 and T47D cells. However , GSI inhibited the Notch signaling pathway , and reversed the enhancement of radiation on the migration and invasion , promoted the enhancement of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of MCF-7 and T47D cells induced by radiation. Except that , we also determined that GSI and dnRBPJ suppressed the upregulation of Notch signaling after radiation therapy. Our study demonstrated that inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway enhanced the radiosensitivity of breast cancer cells , which may provide evident for a beneficial adjuvant therapy in the breast cancer treatment.
