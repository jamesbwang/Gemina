  The symptoms of patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD) have been shown to improve when they perform fast-paced rhythmic cycling movements with their lower limbs. Our goal in this pilot experiment was to test the feasibility and the benefits of a short exercise program involving fast-paced rhythmic movements of the upper limb for patients with PD. We used an experimental procedure that elicits large , fast-paced movements by the participants without the direct instructions to do so by the experimenter. Ten participants with PD ( 71.0 Â± 6.5 years old) performed a 50-min fast-paced rhythmic exercise of the upper limb after withdrawal from PD medication for at least 12 hours. Participants improved their kinematic performance , in terms of accuracy and combined speed and amplitude ( p < 0.02) , as well as their upper-limb MDS-UPDRS motor scores ( p = 0.023). The results demonstrate the feasibility of using the described apparatus to perform an exercise session of approximately 50 min with both arms , and give a preliminary indication of the potential benefit of such an exercise program.
