  Major depressive disorder ( MDD) is a highly prevalent mental disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. However , a clear causative etiology of MDD remains unknown. In this study , we aimed to identify critical protein alterations in plasma from patients with MDD and integrate our proteomics and previous metabolomics data to reveal significantly perturbed pathways in MDD. An isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification ( iTRAQ)- based quantitative proteomics approach was conducted to compare plasma protein expression between patients with depression<symptom> and healthy controls ( CON). For integrative analysis , Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software was used to analyze proteomics and metabolomics data and identify potential relationships among the differential proteins and metabolites. A total of 74 proteins were significantly changed in patients with depression<symptom> compared with those in healthy CON. Bioinformatics analysis of differential proteins revealed significant alterations in lipid transport and metabolic function , including apolipoproteins ( APOE , APOC4 and APOA5) , and the serine protease inhibitor. According to canonical pathway analysis , the top five statistically significant pathways were related to lipid transport , inflammation<symptom> and immunity. Causal network analysis by integrating differential proteins and metabolites suggested that the disturbance of phospholipid metabolism might promote the inflammation<symptom> in the central nervous system.
