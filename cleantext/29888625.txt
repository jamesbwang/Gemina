  Many anatomic pathology laboratories no longer have electron microscopy facilities. A retrospective review of autopsies was performed to identify cases of inborn errors of metabolism ( IEM) and determine the contribution of electron microscopy in making the diagnosis in those cases. Over a period of 17 years , there were 900 perinatal and pediatric autopsies. There were 7 cases ( 1 %) of IEM , including 4 cases of Pompe disease , 1 case of I-cell disease , 1 case of bile acid synthesis defect , and 1 case of mitochondrial disease ( Leigh syndrome<disease>). Electron microscopy was important in the diagnosis of I-cell disease and Pompe disease in our series. This technique enabled a prenatal diagnosis to be made from a chorionic villus biopsy in 2 cases with a positive family history. In less developed countries where upfront genetic testing may be too expensive and may need international referral , electron microscopy can still be useful for diagnosis of IEM , providing an affordable alternative with a more rapid turnaround time compared to gene mutation analysis or enzyme assay. Results can be used both for patient management and as a screen for which cases might benefit from genetic testing.
