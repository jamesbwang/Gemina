  Inorganic phosphate is essential for all life forms , yet microbes in marine environments are in near constant deprivation of this important nutrient. Organophosphonic acids can serve as an alternative source of inorganic phosphate if microbes possess the appropriate biochemical pathways that allow cleavage of the stable carbon-phosphorus bond that defines this class of molecule. One prominent source of inorganic phosphate is methylphosphonic acid , which is found as a constituent of marine-dissolved organic matter. The cycle of biosynthesis and catabolism of methylphosphonic acid by marine microbes is the likely source of supersaturating levels of methane in shallow ocean waters. This review provides an overview of the rich biochemistry that has evolved to synthesize methylphosphonic acid and catabolize this molecule into Pi and methane , with an emphasis on the reactions catalyzed by methylphosphonic acid synthase MpnS and the carbon-phosphorus lyase system. The protocols and experiments that are described for MpnS and carbon-phosphorus lyase provide a foundation for studying the structures and mechanisms of these and related enzymes.
