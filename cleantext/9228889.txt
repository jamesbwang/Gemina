  Research on the relationship between insomnia and nightmares , and suicidal ideation ( SI) has produced variable findings , especially with regard to military samples. This study investigates whether depression<symptom> mediated the relationship between: 1) sleep disturbances and SI , and 2) trauma-related nightmares and SI , in a sample of treatment-seeking Canadian Armed Forces ( CAF) personnel and veterans ( N = 663). Regression analyses were used to investigate associations between sleep disturbances or trauma-related nightmares and SI while controlling for depressive symptom severity , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) symptom severity , anxiety<symptom> symptom severity , and alcohol use severity. Bootstrapped resampling analyses were used to investigate the mediating effect of depression<symptom> Approximately two-thirds of the sample ( 68 %; N = 400) endorsed sleep disturbances and 88 % ( N = 516) reported experiencing trauma-related nightmares. Although sleep disturbances and trauma-related nightmares were both significantly associated with SI on their own , these relationships were no longer significant when other psychiatric conditions were included in the models. Instead , depressive symptom severity emerged as the only variable significantly associated with SI in both equations. Bootstrap resampling analyses confirmed a significant mediating role of depression<symptom> for sleep disturbances. The findings suggest that sleep disturbances and trauma-related nightmares are associated with SI as a function of depressive symptoms in treatment-seeking CAF personnel and veterans. Treating depression<symptom> in patients who present with sleep difficulties may subsequently help mitigate suicide risk.
