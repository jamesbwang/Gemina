  Micro ( mi) RNAs are small , evolutionarily conserved and endogenous noncoding RNA molecules between 19 and 24 nucleotides in length. The potential roles of miRNAs in the carcinogenesis and progression of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) have been studied previously. In the present study , it was revealed that miRNA-216b ( miR-216b) expression was lower in NSCLC tissue and cell lines compared with that in adjacent healthy lung tissue samples and the normal bronchial epithelial 16HBE cell line , respectively. The ectopic expression of miR-216b inhibited the proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cells
