  Loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP) has become a powerful alternative to polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) for pathogen detection in clinical specimens and food matrices. Nontyphoidal Salmonella is a zoonotic pathogen of significant food and feed safety concern worldwide. The first study employing LAMP for the rapid detection of Salmonella was reported in 2005 , 5 years after the invention of the LAMP technology in Japan. This review provides an overview of international efforts in the past decade on the development and application of Salmonella<pathogen> LAMP assays in a wide array of food and feed matrices. Recent progress in assay design , platform development , commercial application , and method validation is reviewed. Future perspectives toward more practical and wider applications of Salmonella<pathogen> LAMP assays in food and feed testing are discussed.
