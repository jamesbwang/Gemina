  Newborns are especially prone to oxidative stress ( OS). Many free radical-mediated diseases have been described in newborns including bronchopulmonary dysplasia , respiratory distress syndrome<disease> , encephalopathy , and kidney injury. Objective of this work was to determine predictive and diagnostic value of urinary malondialdehyde ( UMDA) as a marker for acute kidney injury ( AKI) in critically sick full-term newborns. 67 critically sick full-term neonates were enrolled in the study including 31 newborns with AKI ( group I) and 36 newborns without AKI ( group II). The control group included 40 healthy full-term neonates ( group III). The level of UMDA was measured by means of the test based on the reaction of MDA to thiobarbituric acid. The mean and 95 % confidence interval ( CI) for UMDA was 12.7 ( 11.5; 13.9) µmol/l in group I , 10.2 ( 9.61; 10.8) µmol/l in group II , 9.01 ( 8.16; 9.93) µmol/l in group III ( pI-II < 0.05; pI-III < 0.05; pII-III < 0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that UMDA had AUC 0.80 ( 95 % CI 0.68; 0.93 , p = 0.0014) for AKI. The optimum UMDA cut-point was 12.0 µmol/l. For AKI sensitivity and specificity of UMDA were determined to be 68.2 % ( 95 % CI 45.1; 86.1 %) and 85.7 % ( 95 % CI 69.7; 95.1 %) respectively , with positive predictive value of 75.0 % ( 95 % CI 55.9; 87.6 %) , and negative predictive value of 81.1 % ( 95 % CI 69.7; 88.9 %) , positive likelihood ratio of 4.77 ( 95 % CI 2.02; 11.3) , and negative likelihood ratio of 0.37 ( 95 % CI 0.20; 0.69). This data support studies to evaluate UMDA as an immediate biomarker for AKI in critically sick newborns. However , a larger study should be conducted to assess the diagnostic accuracy of other serum and urinary markers for OS and renal dysfunction , which would enable us to formulate a mathematical model for the prognosis and diagnosis of AKI in newborns.
