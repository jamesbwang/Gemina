  Running on a treadmill is an activity that is novel to many people. Thus , a familiarisation period may be required before reliable and valid determinations of biomechanical parameters can be made. The current study investigated the time required for treadmill familiarisation under barefoot and shod running conditions. Twenty-six healthy men , who were inexperienced in treadmill running , were randomly allocated to run barefoot or shod for 20 minutes on a treadmill at a self-selected comfortable pace. Sagittal-plane kinematics for the ankle , knee and hip , and ground reaction force and spatio-temporal data were collected at two-minute intervals. For the barefoot condition , temporal differences were observed in peak hip flexion and peak knee flexion during swing. For the shod condition , temporal differences were observed for peak vertical ground reaction force. No temporal differences were observed after 8 minutes for either condition. Reliability analysis revealed high levels of consistency ( ICC > 0.90) across all consecutive time-points for all dependent variables for both conditions after 8 minutes with the exception of maximal initial vertical ground reaction force loading rate. Participants in both barefoot and shod groups were therefore considered familiarised to treadmill running after 8 minutes.
