  Spin-caloritronic effects in armchair graphene nanoribbons ( AGNRs) with various ribbon widths and periodic structural defects in the form of triangular antidots were systematically studied. Our results showed that by engineering defects in AGNRs , one could not only reduce the phononic thermal conductance for enhancing the thermoelectric efficiency , but also induce a ferromagnetic ground state. Interestingly , AGNRs with triangular antidots exhibit spin-semiconducting behavior with a tunable spin gap and a narrow spin-polarized band around the Fermi level. Therefore , AGNRs with antidots exhibit spin-up and spin-down currents with opposite flow directions under a temperature gradient , and they also exhibit a giant spin Seebeck coefficient () and spin figure of merit () that are much larger than those of zigzag GNRs. Finally , these results pave the way towards the application of defective AGNRs in spin-caloritronic devices operating at room temperature with a giant spin thermoelectric efficiency.
