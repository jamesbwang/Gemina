  Perineural dexamethasone and intravenous ( IV) dexamethasone have been shown to prolong peripheral nerve block duration. The effects of perineural and IV dexamethasone have only been compared at doses of 4 mg or greater. This triple-blind , randomized trial examined the effect of 1 mg IV versus perineural dexamethasone on interscalene block ( ISB) analgesia duration. Patients undergoing ambulatory shoulder arthroscopy received an ultrasound-guided ISB with 15 mL bupivacaine 0.5 % and 1 mg preservative-free dexamethasone that was administered perineurally ( PeriD) or IV ( IVDex). All patients received IV ketorolac and were discharged on naproxen 500 mg 2 times a day plus oxycodone/acetaminophen as needed. Peripheral nerve block duration , pain , opioid consumption , and block satisfaction were assessed via telephone follow-ups. There were 63 PeriD patients and 62 IVDex patients who completed the primary outcome follow-up. The median time until analgesia from the ISB completely wore off was 3.5 hours ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.0-6.0 hours) longer in the PeriD versus IVDex groups; P = 0.007). Time until the pain relief from the ISB began to wear off was also longer in the PeriD versus IVDex group ( 5.5 hours ( 95 % confidence interval , 2.1-9.0 hours); P = 0.002). Other secondary outcomes , including opioid consumption , satisfaction , and pain scores , were not different between groups. In patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy , low-dose perineural dexamethasone ( 1 mg) in combination with 15 mL of 0.5 % bupivacaine prolonged the median time until pain relief from the ISB completely wore off compared with 1 mg IV dexamethasone. However , the degree of prolongation was smaller than the a priori-defined minimal clinically meaningful difference of 5 hours.
