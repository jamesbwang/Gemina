  The role of the hippocampus in spatial navigation and the presence of vestibular responsive neurons in limbic areas are well established from animal experiments. However , hippocampal spatial processing in humans is not fully understood. Here we employed real whole body and head-on-trunk rotations to investigate how vestibular signals , either alone or in combination with neck-proprioceptive stimulation , shape the spatial frame of reference in patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis ( HS). Patients were asked to point in darkness with a light spot , moved on a cylindrical screen by means of a joystick , into their visual straight ahead direction ( VSA) , to remember this direction in space and to revert back to this point after the rotations. Estimates in HS patients were compared with those of healthy controls and of epileptic patients without hippocampal involvement. All groups produced similar errors after low frequency vestibular stimuli. These errors were eliminated when rotations involved concurrent neck stimulation. Significantly increased variability was observed , however , in both the VSA and reposition estimates after the rotations in HS patients compared to controls. These results suggest that cognitive processing of idiothetic signals for self-motion perception is inaccurate in HS patients. Importantly , however , the responses of HS patients showed no spatial lateralization with regard to right or left HS , suggesting that the underlying neuronal loss attenuates the precision of head direction signal decoding in a non-directional manner. Hence , patients are unable to use these signals as efficiently as normal subjects in the construction a stable head-centric spatial frame of reference.
