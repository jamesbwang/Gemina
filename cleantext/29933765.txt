  Some performance standards for continuous trio breeding in ` shoebox ' cages for inbred stocks and outbred strains ofmice challenge the minimum floor space recommendations in the 8th edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of LaboratoryAnimals. In our study , we evaluated whether continuous trio breeding could be successfully applied to a breeding colonyof genetically engineered mice housed in shoebox cages with a floor area of 67.6 in2. Mice heterozygous for genetically engineered mutations to estrogen receptors and their wildtype counterparts were continuously bred as trios or pairs. Confounding environmental factors were controlled through standardized husbandry practices and husbandry , and all mice were bred simultaneously to control for temporal factors. Several measures of reproductive performance-including number of littersper female , production index , interlitter interval , litter size at birth , litter size at weaning , weaning rate , and body<symptom> weight of pups at weaning- were evaluated over approximately 6 mo.. Regardless of genotype , interlitter interval , litter size at birth , and litter size at weaning were significantly lower for trio-bred mice than for pair-bred mice. In addition , significant interactions emerged between genotype and breeding strategy for these reproductive measures. Furthermore , significant differencesbetween genotypes occurred for interlitter interval and weaning rate , regardless of breeding strategy. Underlying mechanismsto account for effects of genotype on interlitter interval and the interaction of genotype with breeding strategy were unclearbut may reflect effects of overcrowding and reproductive suppression.
