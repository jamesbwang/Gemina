  The dinoflagellate Heterocapsa circularisquama is highly toxic to bivalves. However , significant toxicity to finfish species has not been reported. We previously found that H. circularisquama has light-dependent haemolytic agents. Purification and chemical structural analyses revealed that the haemolytic agent H2-a is a porphyrin derivative , which exhibits light-dependent cytotoxicity toward tumour cells. To clarify the biological activity of H2-a further , its antibacterial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were investigated in this study. A fraction ( F5) equivalent to H2-a purified from the methanol extract of H. circularisquama showed potent light-dependent bactericidal activity toward Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , and the activity was concentration- and light illumination time-dependent; however , Escherichia<pathogen> coli was highly resistant to F5. Electron microscopic observation suggested that F5 induces morphological changes in S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> in a light-dependent manner. Further analysis using other bacterial species showed that the Gram-positive bacterium<pathogen> Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> was more sensitive than the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> and Vibrio<pathogen> alginolyticus<pathogen> These results indicate that F5 is a photo-induced antibacterial agent with relatively higher specificity to Gram-positive bacteria. Iodometric assay suggested that singlet oxygen was generated from light-illuminated F5. Histidine , a specific singlet oxygen scavenger , markedly inhibited the photosensitising antibacterial activity of F5 against S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , suggesting the involvement of singlet oxygen in antibacterial activity. The antibacterial spectrum of F5 was evidently different from that of 5,10,15,20-tetra ( N,N,N-trimethylanilinium) porphyrin tetratosylate , a commercially available porphyrin compound with antibacterial activity. Our results demonstrate that H. circularisquama has a novel antibacterial photosensitiser , a porphyrin derivative , with relatively higher specificity to Gram-positive bacteria. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to discover a porphyrin derivative with antibacterial activity in marine microalga.
