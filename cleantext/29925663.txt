  Type I interferon inhibits viruses through inducing the expression of antiviral proteins , including the myxovirus resistance ( Mx) proteins. Compared to human MxA protein that inhibits a wide range of viruses , the MxB protein has been reported to specifically inhibit primate lentiviruses including HIV-1 , and herpesviruses. Further , the role of endogenous MxB in interferon-α mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infection was questioned by a recent study showing that MxB knockout did not increase the infection of HIV-1 which carried the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV) , and thus was able to infect CD4-negative HT1080 cells. In order to further examine the anti-HIV-1 activity of endogenous MxB , we have used CRISPR/Cas9 to deplete MxB in different cell lines , and observed substantial restoration of HIV-1 infection in the presence of interferon-α treatment. However , this rescue effect of MxB knockout became much less pronounced when infection was performed with HIV-1 carrying VSV G protein. Interestingly , a CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen of interferon-α stimulated genes in U87-MG cells revealed that the interferon induced transmembrane proteins 2 and 3 ( IFITM2 and IFITM3) inhibited VSV G pseudotyped HIV-1 much more strongly than the rest of genes tested , including MxB. Therefore , our results demonstrate the importance of MxB in interferon-α mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infection , which however can be underestimated if infection is performed with VSV G protein pseudotyped HIV-1 , due to the high sensitivity of VSV G mediated infection to the inhibition by IFITM proteins.
