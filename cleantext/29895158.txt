  Human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) exhibits epithelial and mucosal tropism. HPV<pathogen> type 17 belongs to the Betapapillomavirus genus and molecular cloning experiments have identified two subtypes ( 17a and 17b) isolated from epidermodysplasia verruciformis ( EV). HPV<pathogen> subtypes are characterized by dissimilarities from 2 to 10 % at the nucleotide level from their referenced HPV<pathogen>. The aim of this study was to characterize the L1 , E6 , E7 and LCR sequences from an isolate , which was recovered from the oral mucosa of an asymptomatic 63 year-old woman. The whole late gene 1 ( L1) was amplified using several sets of primers. The complete early genes 6 and 7 ( E6 , E7) and the long control region ( LCR) were amplified using specific primers. Potential binding sites for transcriptional factors within the LCR were also investigated. Within these sets , the DNA sequence was altered at 91 positions ( 68 in L1 , 13 in E6 , 8 in E7 , and 2 in LCR sequences). L1 analysis showed high dissimilarity compared with the HPV<pathogen> 17 prototype , reaching 4 % of nucleotide substitutions and leading to a probable third 17 subtype. The E6 oncoprotein presented the highest modification among the sequences studied , with four amino acid changes in comparison with the prototype isolate. One amino acid was modified at a position 62 ( S-T) , a zinc-binding domain ( CxxC ( C) 29 CxxC). Our findings provide data on genetic variations seen in this genotype , reaching to dichotomic branching and pointing to an evolutionary process.
