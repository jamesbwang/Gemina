  Peer training has been identified as a useful tool for delivering undergraduate training in basic life support ( BLS) which is fundamental as an initial response in cases of emergency. This study aimed to ( 1) Evaluate the efficacy of peer-led model in basic life support training among medical students in their first three years of study , compared to professional-led training and ( 2) To assess the efficacy of the course program and students ' satisfaction of peer-led training. A randomized controlled trial with blinded assessors was conducted on 72 medical students from the pre-clinical years ( 1st to 3rd years in Syria) at Syrian Private University. Students were randomly assigned to peer-led or to professional-led training group for one-day-course of basic life support skills. Sixty-four students who underwent checklist based assessment using objective structured clinical examination design ( OSCE) ( practical assessment of BLS skills) and answered BLS knowledge checkpoint-questionnaire were included in the analysis. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in delivering BLS skills to medical students in practical ( P = 0.850) and BLS knowledge questionnaire outcomes ( P = 0.900). Both groups showed statistically significant improvement from pre- to post-course assessment with significant statistical difference in both practical skills and theoretical knowledge ( P-Value < 0.001). Students were satisfied with the peer model of training. Peer-led training of basic life support for medical students was beneficial and it provided a quality of education which was as effective as training conducted by professionals. This method is applicable and desirable especially in poor-resource countries and in crisis situation.
