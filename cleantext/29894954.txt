  A turn-on fluorescent probe ( DAME) for sensing hypochlorous acid ( HClO) with excellent selectivity was presented. The fluorescent probe was composed of coumarin derivative as the fluorophore and dimethylcarbamothioic chloride group with a sulfide moiety as modulator. Additionally , the sulfide moiety would be oxidized by HClO , and then free dye of coumarin derivate was released and exhibited significant fluorescence. In addition , the probe could respond to HClO in solutions within 60 s and the limit of detection was down to 34.75 nM. Moreover , the probe was used for the detection of HClO in tap water through the home-made test paper. And confocal images confirmed that probe DAME could be used for recognizing HClO in living cells.
