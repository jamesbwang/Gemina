  Exoglycosidases are often used for detailed characterization of glycan structures. Bovine kidney α-fucosidase is commonly used to determine the presence of core α1-6 fucose on N-glycans , an important modification of glycoproteins. Recently , several studies have reported that removal of core α1-6-linked fucose from N-glycans labeled with the reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide carbamate fluorescent labels 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidylcarbamate ( AQC) and RapiFluor-MS is severely impeded. We report here the cloning , expression and biochemical characterization of an α-fucosidase from Omnitrophica bacterium<pathogen> ( termed fucosidase O). We show that fucosidase O can efficiently remove α1-6- and α1-3-linked core fucose from N-glycans. Additionally , we demonstrate that fucosidase O is able to efficiently hydrolyze core α1-6-linked fucose from N-glycans labeled with any of the existing NHS-carbamate activated fluorescent dyes.
