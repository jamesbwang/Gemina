  To explore self-care and self-care support in patients with Type 2 diabetes in urban Malaysia. The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in Malaysia and associated long-term and life-changing complications is increasing. With effective self-care and self-care support , severe complications of the condition can be avoided or reduced. Prior to this study , no evidence existed about Malaysian patients ' management of the condition or support for self-care from the healthcare system. A single embedded qualitative case study. Semistructured interviews with 18 patients with Type 2 diabetes aged 28-69 years , healthcare professionals ( n = 19) , observations ( n = 13) of clinic appointments from two urban settings in Malaysia and a documentary analysis. Recordings were transcribed verbatim , field notes were made during observations and the data analysed and synthesised within and across case using Framework analysis. Three main themes explained self-care and self-care support in Malaysia: fatalism , faith and fear. Patients were fatalistic about developing diabetes-they perceived it as inevitable because it is so common in Malaysia. However , faith in God , coupled with fear of the consequences of diabetes , motivated them to engage in self-care practices. The fear was largely induced by diabetes healthcare professionals working in overcrowded clinics , and stretched thinly across the service , who used a direct and uncompromising approach to instil the importance of self-care to avoid severe long-term complications. This study provided important insight on how people in Malaysia developed diabetes , their responses to the disease and the approach of healthcare professionals in supporting them to engage with self-care. Any future development of self-care programmes in Malaysia needs to recognise the factors that motivate patients to self-care and include components that build self-efficacy.
