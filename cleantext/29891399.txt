  Soft-tissue deficiency is a potentially devastating complication of the infected total knee arthroplasty ( TKA). Rotational muscle flaps are commonly used to address these defects. However , reported success rates vary widely. We reviewed 26 consecutive patients who underwent rotational muscle flap surgery for full-thickness anterior soft-tissue defect during treatment of an infected TKA. Twenty-four cases used a medial gastrocnemius rotational flap , 1 used a lateral gastrocnemius flap , and 1 used a rectus<pathogen> femoris-vastus intermedius<pathogen> flap. Implant survival , recurrence of infection , and limb survival were reported. Patient and procedural characteristics were tested for association with failure using Ï‡ Mean follow-up time was 3.3 years. Eighteen of 26 patients ( 69.2 %) experienced recurrent infection requiring an average of 5.3 additional operations ( range , 1-20). Five ( 19.2 %) required arthrodesis while 6 ( 23.1 %) eventually underwent above-the-knee amputation. Two patients ( 7.7 %) died due to complications of revision surgery or persistent infection. Eleven patients ( 42.3 %) were infection free with a retained prosthesis after treatment at a mean follow-up of 5.3 years ( range , 0.7-18.0 years). Rotational muscle flap coverage of soft-tissue defects in the setting of the infected TKA remains a viable salvage option. However , despite adequate tissue coverage , many patients experience recurrent infection requiring additional surgical treatment. Patients and surgeons should be aware of the potential high failure rates observed when treating these complex problems.
