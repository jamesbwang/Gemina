  Developing low-cost catalysts for electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) with superior performance in an alkaline solution is of significance for large-scale applications in aqueous zinc-air batteries ( ZABs). Herein , we describe the in situ design of embedded NiFe nanoparticles into the N-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotube ( NBCNT) with high catalytic performance and stability. The obtained NiFe@NBCNT hybrid exhibits a high electrochemical activity and stability with an unexpectedly low overpotential of âˆ¼ 195 mV for OER at 10 mA cm
