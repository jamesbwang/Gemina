  Infants are selective in their learning from others. However , there is only very limited research on the possible factors that shape this selectivity , especially when it comes to the impact of infants ' familiarity with the informant and the context. The current study investigated whether 14-month-olds preferred to receive and use information provided by an unfamiliar informant ( experimenter) compared with a familiar informant ( parent) and whether this pattern depended on the context ( home vs. laboratory). We tested infants either in the laboratory ( n = 67) or in their home ( n = 70). When both informants presented a novel object with positive or negative emotions , we measured infants ' gaze behavior as an indicator for information search. When infants acted on the novel object themselves , we measured their exploratory behavior as an indicator of information use. Results revealed no effect of context on infants ' information search and use. Rather , we found that the familiarity of informant had distinct effects on infant attention and object exploration. Namely , infants looked longer at the unfamiliar informant across contexts , but they explored more when the familiar informant presented the object compared with when the unfamiliar informant did so. Thus , during information search , 14-month-olds paid most attention to an unfamiliar source of information. However , participants explored the objects more when they came from a familiar source than when they came from an unfamiliar one. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed.
