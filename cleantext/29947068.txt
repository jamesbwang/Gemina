  The purpose of this study was to describe the pathology of the different compartments in endoscopic resection of nasal intestinal-type adenocarcinomas ( ITACs) and its relationships with oncologic outcomes. This retrospective study included all patients endoscopically operated for nasal ITACs , followed by radiotherapy in the majority of cases , between 2004 and 2014. The surgery systematically separated 3 compartments: ethmoid lateral mass , olfactory cleft , and anterior cranial fossa ( in cases with skull-base invasion) to analyze their pathological `` focal '' or `` massive '' invasion by the tumor. Sixty-seven patients ( aged 69.2 ± 9.8 years) were included. Twenty-nine patients ( 43.3 %) had only pathological focal invasion. At 61.0 ± 41.7 months of mean follow-up , the recurrence rates were 34.2 % in the group with massive invasion and 10.3 % in the group with focal invasion ( P = .023). The disease-specific death rate had a tendency to be higher in the group with massive invasion ( 23.7 % vs 6.9 % for the group with focal invasion; P = .097). By Kaplan-Meier analysis , the 5-year disease-specific survival rate was better in the group with focal invasion than the group with massive invasion ( P = .01). The 5-year overall survival was not different between the 2 groups ( 47.4 % and 65.5 % for focal invasion and massive invasion respectively; P = .14). Compartmentalized endoscopic resection , combined with postoperative radiotherapy , is one way to operate on nasal ITACs with good oncologic outcomes.
