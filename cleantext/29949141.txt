  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the histocompatibility and feasibility of structure and function of bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs) and silk fibroin meniscus porous scaffolds in repairing meniscus injury in rabbits. BMSCs were cultured and identified in vitro , silk fibroin meniscus porous scaffolds were prepared and the histocompatibility of porous scaffolds was evaluated via in vitro culture. Silk fibroin-BMSCs porous scaffolds were implanted into the meniscus defect area of New Zealand white rabbits as the experimental group , the blank scaffold group without BMSCs , pure BMSCs group and blank control group were set up with 10 rabbits in each group. Joint capsules were opened for general observation at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after operation. The specimens received the HE staining , alkaline toluidine blue staining , and immunohistochemical staining of Type I and Type II collagen and S100 protein. In vitro HE staining and SEM observation showed that the scaffolds showed the sponge-like structure with abundant microporous structure on the surface and inside , which had a good histocompatibility with BMSCs. At 6 and 12 weeks after operation in experimental group , meniscus-like tissues were found in the meniscus defect area. HE staining showed the fibrous cartilage-like structure and obvious collagenous fiber structure around arranged in an orderly manner. Alkaline toluidine blue staining showed the cartilage-specific glycosaminoglycan ( GAG); Type I and Type II collagen and S100 protein staining were strongly positive. However , the above changes were not seen in other groups. BMSCs and silk fibroin meniscus porous scaffolds have a better histocompatibility and feasibility of structure and function in repairing meniscus injury in rabbits.
