  The associated patient morbidity and resource-intensive nature of managing surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> ( SSI) has focused attention toward not only improving treatment protocols but also enhancing preventative measures. The purpose of this review was to summarize the relevant updated CDC guidelines for the prevention of SSI that were released in 2017. The CDC recommends the integration of the guidelines for improvement in quality metrics , reportable outcomes , and patient safety. The updated guidelines include generalized recommendations for parenteral antimicrobial prophylaxis , non-parenteral antimicrobial prophylaxis , glycemic control , normothermia , oxygenation , and antiseptic prophylaxis. The arthroplasty section includes recommendations for blood transfusion , systemic immunosuppressive therapy , and antibiotics during drain use. There was low-quality evidence precluding recommendations for preoperative intra-articular corticosteroid injections , orthopedic surgical space suits , and biofilm management. The recommendations provided throughout this review , including more recent guidelines from other organizations such as the AAOS and ACR , should assist clinicians in developing and/or refining surgical site prevention protocols for their patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty procedures.
