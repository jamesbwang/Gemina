  The purpose of this study is to: ( 1) characterise risk factors for prolonged narcotic use following total hip arthroplasty ( THA); ( 2) examine preoperative and prolonged postoperative narcotic use as independent risk factors for complications following THA. A national database identified primary THA patients from 2007-2015. Preoperative ( POU) and prolonged postoperative narcotics users ( PPU) were identified. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilised to identify any patient-related risk factors for prolonged use , and examined POU and PPU as risk factors for complications following THA. 55,354 THA patients were included , 18,740 ( 33.8 %) POU and 14,996 ( 27.1 %) PPU. Preoperative narcotics use was the most significant factor associated with prolonged postoperative narcotic use. Preoperative and prolonged postoperative use were associated with significantly higher complications postoperatively. Preoperative narcotic use is the most significant patient specific risk factor for prolonged postoperative narcotic use. POUs and PPUs are at a significantly higher risk of postoperative infection and revision surgery.
