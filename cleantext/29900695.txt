  Structural maintenance of chromosome flexible domain containing 1 ( Smchd1) is a chromatin regulatory gene for which mutations are associated with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and arhinia. The contribution of oocyte- and zygote-expressed SMCHD1 to early development was examined in mice ( Mus<pathogen> musculus<pathogen> using an siRNA knockdown approach. Smchd1 knockdown compromised long-term embryo viability , with reduced embryo nuclear volumes at the morula stage , reduced blastocyst cell number , formation and hatching , and reduced viability to term. RNAseq analysis of Smchd1 knockdown morulae revealed aberrant increases in expression of a small number of trophectoderm-related genes and reduced expression of cell proliferation genes , including S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 ( Skp2). Smchd1 expression was elevated in embryos deficient for Caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2 ( Cdx2 , a key regulator of trophectoderm specification) , indicating that Smchd1 is normally repressed by CDX2. These results indicate that Smchd1 plays an important role in the preimplantation embryo , regulating early gene expression and contributing to long-term embryo viability. These results extend the known functions of SMCHD1 to the preimplantation period and highlight important function for maternally expressed Smchd1 mRNA and protein.
