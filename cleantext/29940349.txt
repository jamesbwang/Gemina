  The aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation ( t-VNS) in the palliative treatment of drug resistant epileptic patients ineligible for surgery. Twenty adult patients received four hours of t-VNS per day for six months ( T1) , followed by a two-month washout period ( T2). The frequency and type of seizures<symptom> recorded at T1 and T2 were compared with those occurring in the three months preceding study entry ( T0). Responders ( > 30 % reduction in the total number of seizures<symptom>) subsequently received two hours of t-VNS per day for further six months ( T3). All patients underwent electroencephalography ( EEG) and completed the Quality of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire at baseline and T1. At T1 six patients were considered responders. In these patients , at T3 the average reduction in seizure<symptom> frequency was 60 % compared to T0 ( p = 0.043) , and 51 % compared to T2 ( p = 0.043). Responders had more often seizures<symptom> with falls ( 5 of 6; 83.3 %) compared with non-responders ( 3 of 14; 21.4 %) ( p = 0,010) and t-VNS reduced their frequency by a percentage ranging from 47.5 to 100 %. There was no change in responders ' EEG findings after stimulation. At the end of the trial , three responders continued t-VNS , one implanted VNS. t-VNS had no or minimal side effects and significantly reduced seizures<symptom> in about one third of the enrolled patients. Further studies should be planned to assess whether t-VNS is a suitable tool to predict the efficacy of implanted VNS.
