  Composting is an economic and effective technology for solid waste treatment , which is an essential method to promote the biogeochemical cycle of contaminants. However , the application of this technology was limited by the bio-degradative recalcitrance of lignin and other kind of phytotoxic substances release. The combination with microorganisms and enzymes is a popular and efficient way to enhanced composting. This study , referring to metabolic mechanisms , fungal molecular and biogeochemical cycles , was performed to investigate the effects of lignin degradation , carbon metabolic diversity , as well as the related changes induced by these two kinds of complex enzymes in composting. The biological diversity is important indicator in ecosystem , which concerns the environmental applicability of one technology. The carbon metabolism diversity reflected the biogeochemical cycles of organic matter , which was also an essential input to analyze the effects of composting. The changes on the diversity characteristics of carbon are essential to comprehensively understand the deep mechanisms of this process , and extended the application of complex enzymes in the field of enhanced composting. The analysis of Biolog revealed that the utilization of pyruvic acid methyl ester , α-Cyclodextrin , d-Mannitol , d-Galacturonic , Itaconic acid and l-asparagine were deeply promoted , and that of d , l-α-Glycerol-phosphate , l-Threonine , Glycyl-l-Glutamic acid and putrescine were depressed by adding the complex enzyme in composting. Moreover , according to the data , the addition of complex enzymes improved the degradation efficiency and the metabolic capacity of carbon in composting. These findings undoubtedly contribute to the development of enzyme-based technologies and the applications of complex enzymes in composting , which is of great benefit to eliminate the limitation and extend the application of composting.
