  HSV-1 is a mucosal and nerve pathogen , whose morbidity shows an increasing tendency. Although several antiviral drugs exist , there is no cure for viral latency for virtually all carriers. There is an urgent need for an HSV-1 vaccine to control infection and limit its spread and recurrence. The UL18 gene , encoding a vital component of capsids , is one of the essential genes of HSV-1. Deletion of UL18 from HSV-1 may be exploited as a new approach to develop an attenuated vaccine. The purpose of this study was to construct a DNA vaccine with a full-length UL18 gene deletion of the HSV-1 genome that can induce an effective immune response. A UL18-knockdown plasmid ( BAC-HSV-1ΔUL18) was constructed using the bacterial markerless gene knockout system , consisting of the functional pREDI plasmid and BAC-HSV-1 plasmid. Mice were immunized weekly for 3 weeks , and at 1 week post immunization , blood and splenocyte samples of vaccinated and control groups of mice were prepared for immunogenicity assessment. The level of immune response was evaluated using a DTH assay , cytokine determination , and splenocyte proliferation assay. Combination of the pREDI plasmid and BAC-HSV-1 plasmid provides an effective bacterial markerless gene knockout system. Using two-step homologous recombination with the UL18 homologous recombination fragment constructed by multistep PCR amplification , BAC-HSV-1ΔUL18 plasmid vaccine was successfully constructed and was found to significantly enhance cellular immune responses.
