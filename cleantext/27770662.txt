  Although sleep , chronic<disease> disease<disease> and its related mortality are extensively studied areas , the association between stroke and sleep duration is relatively unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between long and short sleep duration and stroke prevalence. A cross-sectional survey study. Adult surveyees ( aged ≥ 19 years) who answered items relating to sleep duration and stroke in the 2010-2014 Korean National Health and Nutrition Surveys ( n = 17601). Participants were divided into three groups by sleep duration ( short: ≤ 6 hours/day , normal: 7-8 hours/day and long: ≥ 9 hours/day). Stroke prevalence in each sleep duration group was compared using logistic regression analysis , and sociodemographic characteristics , medical history , lifestyle habits and mental health factors were set as confounding variables. On adjusting for sex and age , each sleep-duration group displayed significantly different health-related characteristics. The short sleep and long sleep duration groups indicated significantly higher psychological factors for stress perception , depressive symptoms and psychiatric counselling compared with the normal sleep duration group. On adjustment of various confounders , the long sleep duration group demonstrated significantly higher ORs for stroke compared with the normal sleep duration group ( OR 1.96 , 95 % CI 1.06 to 3.61). Also , when stratified by sex , men did not exhibit differences in stroke prevalence by sleep duration , but women showed higher stroke prevalence in the long sleep duration group compared with normal sleep duration ( OR 2.94 , 95 % CI 1.21 to 7.17). Longer sleep duration was associated with higher stroke prevalence , and this trend was more pronounced in women.
