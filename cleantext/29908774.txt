  To determine whether the blastocyst development rate , as assessed by the day of trophectoderm biopsy ( day 5 vs. day 6) , affects the live birth rate ( LBR) of similarly graded euploid blastocysts. Retrospective cohort study. Academic medical center. Patients who underwent frozen-thawed single euploid blastocyst transfers from 2013 to 2016 were included. Blastocyst morphologic grading was performed on day 5 or day 6 before the biopsy , with embryos designated into the following groups: good ( 3-6AA , 3-6AB , and 3-6BA) , average ( 2-6BB) , and poor ( 2-6BC and 2-6CB). Frozen-thawed embryo transfer. Implantation rate ( IR) and LBR. A total of 701 frozen-thawed single euploid blastocyst transfer cycles were included. Cycles in which day 5 blastocysts were transferred ( n = 366) were associated with a significantly higher LBR than those in which day 6 blastocysts were transferred ( n = 335; 60.4 % vs. 44.8 %). The odds ratio remained significant after controlling for all confounders , including the blastocyst grading. Furthermore , there was a significant difference in LBRs between good-quality , average-quality , and poor-quality blastocysts ( 67.8 % , 53.4 % , and 29.5 % , respectively). Embryos reaching good-quality blastocysts on day 5 yielded significantly higher LBR ( 72.8 % vs. 56.5 %) and IR ( 77.7 % vs. 58.7 %) compared with those reaching similar quality blastocysts on day 6. Similarly , day 5 average-quality embryos conveyed a significantly higher IR compared with day 6 embryos of the same quality ( 64.4 % vs. 53.4 %). In addition to aneuploidy assessment , the speed of embryo development to the blastocyst stage and an evaluation of blastocyst morphology are critical to selecting the best embryo.
