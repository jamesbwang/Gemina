  Entrapment efficiency ( EE) is a crucial parameter for the evaluation of nanocarriers. The accurate measurement of EE demands clear separation of nanocarriers from free drugs , which so far has not been clearly validated due to a lack of functional tools to identify nanocarriers. Herein , an environment-responsive water-quenching fluorophore was employed to label and identify model nanocarriers , polycaprolactone nanoparticles ( PN) , methoxy polyethylene glycol-poly ( d,l-lactic acid) polymeric micelles ( PM) and solid lipid nanoparticles ( SLN). The separation process of three commonly used methods ( centrifugation , ultrafiltration and gel permeation chromatography) was visualized by live imaging. The separation efficiency of the centrifugation method is very poor , especially for PM ( 40 nm) , SLN ( 100 nm) and PN ( 100 nm); only PN ( 200 nm) can be efficiently separated but at a consumption of enormous energy. The ultrafiltration method shows the best separation efficiency with only 0.32-0.93 % of leakage of the nanocarriers. Gel permeation chromatography exhibits good separation as well but suffers from low recovery , a potential factor that might compromise the accuracy of EE measurement. In conclusion , the ultrafiltration method is the method of choice for efficient separation and accurate measurement of EE.
