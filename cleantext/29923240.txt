  The gold-catalyzed annulation of diethynyl N-heterocycles for the synthesis of quinoxaline-/ phenazine-based pentalenes and the study of their optoelectronic properties are described. The inhibition of the gold catalyst by the nitrogen centers in the substrate and the product could be overcome by increasing the reaction temperature to 130 °C , which usually leads to catalyst decomposition in gold catalysis. At 130 °C , 6,7-di ( arylethynyl) quinoxalines in chlorobenzene give the corresponding pentalenes. The annulation of 2,3-di ( arylethynyl) quinoxalines requires an even higher temperature under microwave irradiation. The quinoxaline-based pentalenes showed lower LUMO levels compared to the corresponding naphthalene-based pentalenes.
