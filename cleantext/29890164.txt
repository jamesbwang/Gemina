  Explanted hydrophilic intraocular lenses ( IOLs) with clinically significant opacification after pars plana vitrectomy ( PPV) were assessed for material change and optical quality , in an in vitro laboratory study. Retrospective observational case series. Ten opacified IOLs after PPV with intraocular gas injection were analyzed in a laboratory setting. Analyses included evaluation of patients ' medical history , optical quality assessment , light microscopy , histologic staining , scanning electron microscopy , and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. In all 10 IOLs a thin layer of calcium phosphate that had accumulated underneath either the anterior or posterior optical surface in a central circular area of the IOL optic caused the opacification. The calcifications lead to deterioration of the modulation transfer function ( MTF) across all spatial frequencies. PPV with instillation of gas into a pseudophakic eye with an acrylic hydrophilic lens seems to increase the risk for secondary calcification irrespective of the manufacturer. In these cases , IOL exchange is the only treatment option available. Since IOL exchange is associated with a high intraoperative complication rate , our results suggest to consider the risk of IOL calcification when implanting hydrophilic acrylic IOLs.
