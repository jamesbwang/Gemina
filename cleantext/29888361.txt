  We report an operationally convenient reduction of CO2 to methanol via cobalt catalysed hydroboration which occurs under mild reaction conditions. Addition of NaHBEt3 to Co ( acac) 3 generates an active hydroboration catalyst , which is proposed to be a `` Co-H '' species on the basis of infrared spectroscopy. The reduction of CO2 in the presence of various boranes showed that BH3 Â· SMe2 afforded near quantitative conversion ( 98 % NMR yield) to methanol upon hydrolysis.
