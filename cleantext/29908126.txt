  The maintenance of protein homeostasis ( proteostasis) is a fundamental aspect of cell physiology that is essential for the survival of organisms under a variety of environmental and/or intracellular stress conditions. Acute and/or persistent stress exceeding the capacity of the intracellular homeostatic systems results in protein aggregation and/or damaged organelles that leads to pathological cellular states often resulting in cell death. These events are continuously suppressed by a complex macromolecular machinery that uses different intracellular pathways to maintain the proteome integrity in the various subcellular compartments ensuring a healthy cellular life span. Recent findings have highlighted the role of the multifunctional enzyme type 2 transglutaminase ( TG2) as a key player in the regulation of intracellular pathways , such as autophagy/mitophagy , exosomes formation and chaperones function , which form the basis of proteostasis regulation under conditions of cellular stress. Here , we review the role of TG2 in these stress response pathways and how its various enzymatic activities might contributes to the proteostasis control.
