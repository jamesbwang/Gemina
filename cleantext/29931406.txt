  Human exposure to environmental pollutants is widespread. It was suggested that exposure to non-essential heavy metals may adversely affect semen development in men. To evaluate associations between non-essential heavy metals in blood and seminal fluid and semen quality parameters in men. Male partners of heterosexual couples were included. The following elements were measured in blood and seminal fluid: lead ( Pb) , cadmium ( Cd) , arsenic ( As) , barium ( Ba) , mercury ( Hg) , and uranium ( U) using ion-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The fertility clinic at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Semen quality parameters ( volume , concentration , total count , progressive<symptom> motility<symptom> , viability , and normal morphology). We found that participants with low-quality semen had significantly higher Cd and Ba concentrations in the seminal fluid than participants with normal-quality semen. We also observed significant associations between low sperm viability and higher blood Cd and Ba , as well as higher seminal Pb , Cd , Ba , and U. Furthermore , U concentrations in the seminal fluid were associated with increased odds ratios for below-reference progressive sperm motility and normal morphology. Environmental exposures to Pb , Cd , Ba , and U appear to adversely influence sperm development in men. In non-occupationally exposed men , measurements of heavy metals in the seminal fluid may be more predictive of below-reference sperm quality parameters than in blood.
