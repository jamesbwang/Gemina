  The solid-state microstructure of a conjugated polymer is the most important parameter determining its properties and performance in ( opto)- electronic devices. A huge amount of research has been dedicated to tuning and understanding how the sequence of monomers , the nature and frequency of defects , the exact backbone conformation , and the assembly and crystallinity of conjugated polymers affect their basic photophysics and charge transporting properties. However , because of the lack of reliable high-resolution analytical techniques , all the structure-property relations proposed in the literature are based either on molecular modeling or on indirect experimental data averaged on polydisperse samples. We show that a combination of electrospray vacuum deposition and high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy allows the imaging of individual conjugated polymers with unprecedented detail , thereby unraveling structural and self-assembly characteristics that have so far been impossible to determine.
