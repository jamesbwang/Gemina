  DNA in micronuclei is likely to get damaged. When shattered DNA from micronuclei gets reincorporated into the primary nucleus , aberrant rearrangements can take place , a phenomenon referred to as chromothripsis. Here , we investigated how chromatids from micronuclei act in subsequent divisions and how this affects their fate. We observed that the majority of chromatids derived from micronuclei fail to establish a proper kinetochore in mitosis , which is associated with problems in chromosome alignment , segregation and spindle assembly checkpoint activation. Remarkably , we found that , upon their formation , micronuclei already display decreased levels of important kinetochore assembly factors. Importantly , these defects favour the exclusion of the micronucleus over the reintegration into the primary nucleus over several divisions. Interestingly , the defects observed in micronuclei are likely overcome once micronuclei are reincorporated into the primary nuclei , as they further propagate normally. We conclude that the formation of a separate small nuclear entity represents a mechanism for the cell to delay the stable propagation of excess chromosome ( s) and/or damaged DNA , by inducing kinetochore defects.
