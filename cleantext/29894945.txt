  Industrial wastewater reuse together with zero or near zero liquid discharges have been a growing trend due to the requirement of sustainable water management mandated by water scarcity and tightening discharge regulations. Studies have been conducted on the reclamation of textile industry wastewater using RO processes. However a lot of scientific attention has been drawn upon limiting the amount of concentrate generated from RO processes , which depends on the concentrations of scale forming ions in the concentrate stream. Hence , this study aims at investigating the applicability of an ultra-filtration ( UF) membrane integrated pellet reactor to remove scale forming ions , i.e. Ca
