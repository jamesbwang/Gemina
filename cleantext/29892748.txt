  We show that the incorporation of chiral bioinspired photochromic compounds into inherently chiral DNA matrices enables the building of smart nanoscale photoswitchable chiroptical assemblies tunable over a wide range of wavelengths. Moreover , the use of light as external trigger affords precise control of the resulting hybrid DNA nanostructures , and their chiroptical activities can be spatially modulated without photochemical
