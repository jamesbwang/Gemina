  Psychiatric patients have high tobacco use prevalence , dependence , and withdrawal severity. A tobacco-free psychiatric hospitalization necessitates the management of nicotine withdrawal ( NW) for tobacco using patients. NW management often requires the provision of approved nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT) to patients , which may also motivate tobacco users towards cessation. However , few studies have examined the associations between providing NRT , motivation to quit , and NW among psychiatric patients. To examine the associations between providing NRT at admission and motivation to quit smoking and severity of NW symptoms. A retrospective review of the medical records of 255 tobacco using patients on whom NW was assessed during their hospital stay. The time when NRT was provided ( i.e. , at admission vs. not provided vs. on the unit) , motivation to quit smoking , and 8-item Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale were assessed. The primary NW symptom was ` craving ' ( 65.1 %); reporting of ` anxiety<symptom> ' varied by psychiatric diagnosis. Providing NRT at admission was not associated with motivation to quit. Patients receiving NRT on the unit ( i.e. , delayed receipt) had significantly higher NW than those who received NRT at admission. In multivariate analyses , receiving NRT on the unit was significantly associated with greater NW severity ( Î² = .19 , p = .002). Among psychiatric patients , providing NRT at admission is associated with greater severity of NW. The provision of NRT for NW management may be considered as standard practice during tobacco-free psychiatric stays. Future studies may consider the effect of other tobacco treatment medications ( such as varenicline , bupropion) on managing NW.
