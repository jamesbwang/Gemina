  A 2-year-old boy was presented to us with right-side hemiparesis<symptom> after trivial fall. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed an infarct in left basal ganglia and thalamic region. Secondary causes of stroke were ruled out. The child was managed conservatively. Basal ganglia infarct secondary to minor trauma is a rare event. Possible mechanisms leading to such an event and its management are discussed.
