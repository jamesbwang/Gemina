  Lentinula edodes is a popular cultivated edible mushroom with high nutritional and medicinal value. To understand the regulation of gene expression in the dikaryotic mycelium and mature fruiting body in the commercially important Korean L. edodes strain , we first performed comparative transcriptomic analysis , using Illumina HiSeq platform. De novo assembly of these sequences revealed 11,675 representative transcripts in two different stages of L. edodes. A total of 9,092 unigenes were annotated and subjected to Gene Ontology , EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups , and Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG) analyses. Gene expression analysis revealed that 2,080 genes were differentially expressed , with 1,503 and 577 upregulated in the mycelium and a mature fruiting body , respectively. Analysis of 18 KEGG categories indicated that fruiting body-specific transcripts were significantly enriched in ` replication and repair ' and ` transcription ' pathways , which are important for premeiotic replication , karyogamy , and meiosis during maturation. We also searched for fruiting body-specific proteins such as aspartic protease , gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase , and cyclohexanone monooxygenase , which are involved in fruiting body maturation and isolation of functional substances. These transcriptomes will be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of mature fruiting body development and beneficial properties , and contribute to the characterization of novel genes in L. edodes.
