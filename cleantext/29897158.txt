  Amorphous phosphorus nitride imide nanotubes ( HPN) are reported as a novel substrate to stabilize materials containing single-metal sites. Abundant dangling unsaturated P vacancies play a role in stabilization. Ruthenium single atoms ( SAs) are successfully anchored by strong coordination interactions between the d orbitals of Ru and the lone pair electrons of N located in the HPN matrix. The atomic dispersion of Ru atoms can be distinguished by X-ray absorption fine structure measurements and spherical aberration correction electron microscopy. Importantly , Ru SAs@PN is an excellent electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) in 0.5 m H
