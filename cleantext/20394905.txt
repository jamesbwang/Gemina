  Doppler echocardiography with early diastolic transmitral velocity ( E)/ early mitral annular diastolic velocity ( E ') ratio has been proposed as the best predictor for evaluating left ventricle ( LV) filling pressure. A dimensionless index E/ ( E ' × S ') ratio ( S ' = systolic mitral annulus velocity) resulted in readily , reproducible , and reliable predictor of LV filling pressure. We assessed the prognostic impact of E/E ' × S ') in patients with asymptomatic heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF). We calculated E/ ( E ' × S ') in 337 patients ( 179 male , 53 %; age 54.7 ± 13.7 years) using the average of septal and lateral mitral annular velocities. We considered a composite endpoint as follows: all-cause death , acute myocardial infarction , stroke , and HF exacerbation. Baseline ejection fraction resulted 60.2 ± 11.8 %; E/E ' × S ') was 1.45 ± 0.8 , with S ' 7.4 ± 2.4 cm/s and E/E ' 9.5 ± 5.4. After a 22-month median follow-up , there were 42 events: 5 deaths ( 12 %) , 3 acute myocardial infarctions ( 7 %) , 1 stroke ( 2 %) , and 33 HF hospitalizations ( 79 %). In patients reaching the composite endpoint , E/ ( E ' × S ') resulted 2.07 ± 1.1 versus 1.3 ± 0.7 in event-free population ( E/ ( E ' × S ') was an independent predictor for the future cardiac events in asymptomatic HF.
