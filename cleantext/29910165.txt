  To evaluate the best collimation used in wide volume ( WV) mode to cover the abdomen in computed tomography ( CT) urography in terms of radiation dose and image quality. This study was performed on a 320 × 0.5 mm detector row CT unit. The first part identified the lowest volume CT dose index ( CTDIvol) by using the topograms data of 25 medium size patients ( 13 men and 12 women; mean age: 52 ± 9 ( SD) years; age range: 46-68 years) using different collimations on WV from 6 cm to 16 cm and the one of the helical mode for the same coverage length. The second part consisted of a clinical evaluation of this result including 45 medium size patients ( 32 men and 13 women; mean age: 68 ± 14 ( SD) years; age range: 45-72 years). The qualitative evaluation included several items based on a 5-point Likert scale. The first part of the study indicated that a collimation of 10 cm ( 200 × 0.5 mm) in WV mode with 5 volumes had the lowest CTDIvol ( 2.78 ± 0.35 mGy; range: 2.35-3.21 mGy) compared to helical mode ( 4.38 ± 0.48 mGy , range: 3.75-4.95 mGy). In the second part , the mean radiation dose reduction by comparison with helical mode was 44.03 % ± 0.36 % ( P < 0.001) and 51.16 % ± 1.22 % ( P < 0.005) for CTDIvol and DLP , respectively. Wide volume mode of the abdomen can be performed with a significant radiation dose reduction with a collimation of 10 cm ( 200 × 0.5 mm) and five volumes.
