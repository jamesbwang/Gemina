  The purpose of the study is to determine whether a novel semi-automated DIXON-based fat quantification algorithm can reliably quantify visceral fat using a CT-based reference standard. This was an IRB-approved retrospective cohort study of 27 subjects who underwent abdominopelvic CT within 7 days of proton density fat fraction ( PDFF) mapping on a 1.5 T MRI. Cross-sectional visceral fat area per slice ( cm Visceral fat area per slice ranged from 9.2 to 429.8 cm MR- and CT-based visceral fat quantification are highly correlated and have good cross-modality reliability , indicating that visceral fat quantification by either method can yield a stable and reliable biomarker.
