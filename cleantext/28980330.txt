  The Government of Manitoba launched the provincial Take-Home Naloxone Program in January 2017. By the end of September 2017 , there were over 60 sites operating in Manitoba. These sites distributed 765 kits to people at risk of opioid overdose , and 93 of these kits were replacement kits used in overdose events. Most of these events occurred among males ( 60.2 %) and in a private residence ( 72.0 %). Fentanyl and carfentanil were the most common substances reported during overdose events. Take-Home Naloxone Program data provide important information about the unique context of the opioid crisis in Manitoba.
