  Sepsis<disease> is defined as a life-threatening condition , resulting from a dysregulated and harmful response of the hosts ' immune system to infection. Apart from this , the ( over-) compensating mechanisms counterbalancing the inflammatory response have been proven to render the host susceptible to further infections and increase delayed mortality. Our study aimed to unravel the heterogeneity of immune response in early sepsis<disease> and to explain the biology behind it. A systematic search of public repositories yielded 949 microarray samples from patients with sepsis<disease> of different infectious origin and early after clinical manifestation. These were merged into a meta-expression set , and after applying sequential conservative bioinformatics filtering , an in-deep analysis of transcriptional heterogeneity , as well as a comparison to samples of healthy controls was performed. We can identify two distinct clusters of patients ( cluster 1: 655 subjects , cluster 2: 294 subjects) according to their global blood transcriptome. While both clusters exhibit only moderate differences in direct comparison , a comparison of both clusters individually to healthy controls yielded strong expression changes of genes involved in immune responses. Both comparisons found similar regulated genes , with a stronger dysregulation occurring in the larger patient cluster and implicating a loss of monocyte and T cell function , co-occurring with an activation of neutrophil granulocytes. We propose a consistent-but in its extent varying-presence of immunosuppression , occurring as early in sepsis<disease> as its clinical manifestation and irrespective of the infectious origin. While certain cell types possess contradictory activation states , our finding underlines the urgent need for an early host-directed therapy of sepsis<disease> side-by-side with antibiotics.
