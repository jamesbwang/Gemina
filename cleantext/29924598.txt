  Developing portable and sensitive devices for point of care detection of low abundance bioactive molecules is highly valuable in early diagnosis of disease. Herein , an ultrasensitive photonic crystals-assisted rolling circle amplification ( PCs-RCA) biochip was constructed and further applied to circulating microRNAs ( miRNAs) detection in serum. The biochip integrated the optical signal enhancement capability of biomimetic PCs surface with the thousand-fold signal amplification feature of RCA. The biomimetic PCs displayed periodic dielectric nanostructure and significantly enhanced the signal intensity of RCA reaction , leading to efficient improvement of detection sensitivity. A limit of detection ( LOD) as low as 0.7 aM was obtained on the PCs-RCA biochip , and the LOD was 7 orders of magnitude lower than that of standard RCA. Moreover , the PCs-RCA biochip could discriminate a single base variation in miRNAs. Accurate quantification of ultralow-abundance circulating miRNAs in clinical serum samples was further achieved with the PCs-RCA biochip , and patients with the nonsmall cell lung carcinoma were successfully distinguished from healthy donors. The PCs-RCA biochip can detect bioactive molecules with ultrahigh sensitivity and good specificity , making it valuable in clinical disease diagnosis and health assessment.
