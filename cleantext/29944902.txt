  Tobacco control has made strides in prevention and cessation , but deaths will not decline rapidly without massive behavior change. Currently , inhaled smoke from combusting tobacco is chiefly responsible for prematurely killing 7.2 million people worldwide and 530,000 in the United States annually. An array of noncombustible nicotine products ( NNPs) has emerged and has disrupted the marketplace. Saving lives more speedily will require societal acceptance of locating a `` sweet spot '' within a three-dimensional framework where NNPs are simultaneously: 1. Less toxic , 2. Appealing ( can reach smokers at scale) , and 3. Satisfying ( adequate nicotine delivery) to displace smoking. For this harm minimization framework to eliminate smoking , a laser focus on `` smoking control '' ( not general tobacco control) is needed. By adopting these economically viable NNPs as part of the solution , NNPs can be smoking control 's valued ally. Synthesis of the science indicates that policy and regulation can sufficiently protect youth while speeding the switch away from smoking. Despite some risks of nicotine dependence that can be mitigated but not eliminated , no credible evidence counters the assertion that NNPs will save lives if they displace smoking. But scientific evidence and advocacy has selectively exaggerated NNP harms over benefits. Accurate communication is crucial to dispel the misperception of NNPs harms and reassure smokers they can successfully replace smoking cigarettes with NNPs. Saving more lives now is an attainable and pragmatic way to call for alignment of all stakeholders and factions within traditional tobacco control rather than perpetuate the unrealized and unrealizable perfection of nicotine prohibition.
