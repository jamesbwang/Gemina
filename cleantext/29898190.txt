  A first-degree relative affected by obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD) and obsessive-compulsive symptoms ( OCS) in childhood is an important risk factor for developing the disorder in adulthood. The relationship between a family history of OCD and the presence of OCS and its correlates in childhood is not well established. A total of 66 children whose parents or siblings have been diagnosed with OCD were assessed for the presence of OCS and clinical correlates. Three children ( 4.5 %) were reported to have received an OCD diagnosis and another 26 ( 39.4 %) were identified as having OCS. Children with OCS had higher rates of coercive behavior and came from families with lower socioeconomic status. Contamination/cleaning dimension symptoms in the proband were associated with OCS in the assessed children. OCS are frequent among family members of individuals with OCD and are associated with socioeconomic status , coercive behaviors and proband contamination/cleaning symptoms. Future longitudinal studies should test the risk of developing OCD in association with these characteristics.
