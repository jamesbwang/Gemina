  Human Genome Variation Society ( HGVS) nomenclature is a de facto clinical standard for reporting DNA sequence variants. With increasing use of high-throughput sequencing , manual generation of HGVS nomenclatures for all variants is impractical and error-prone. It is therefore beneficial to include one or more HGVS generator tools in next-generation sequencing ( NGS) bioinformatics pipelines to enable automated , consistent , and accurate generation of HGVS nomenclature after appropriate validation. The authors implemented an HGVS nomenclature tool , the hgvs package , by integrating it into their custom-developed NGS variant management and reporting software. Use of Docker containers provided a strategic advantage to the integration process. Clinical implementation of the hgvs package was validated using a cohort of 330 variants that appropriately represented cancer-related genes and clinically important variant types. The hgvs package was able to generate HGVS-compliant variant nomenclature ( both c. and p.) for 308 of the 330 ( 93.3 %) variants , including all those in the coding and untranslated regions , and 32 of 35 ( 91.4 %) in the consensus splice site region. Discrepant HGVS nomenclature involved variants in the intronic ( 16 of 40) and consensus splice site ( 3 of 35) regions with repeat sequences. Overall , implementation of the hgvs package in the clinical NGS workflow improved consistency and accuracy of reporting HGVS nomenclature.
