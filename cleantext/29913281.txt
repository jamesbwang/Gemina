  As many as 45 % of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD) still have symptoms after receiving once-daily proton pump inhibitor ( PPI) therapy. We aimed to compare reflux characteristics and patterns between responders and non-responders to once-daily PPI therapy using combined impedance-pH monitoring. Patients who reported heartburn and/or regurgitation at least twice per week for 3 months while receiving standard-dose PPI therapy were assigned to the PPI failure group ( n = 16). Patients who reported a complete resolution of symptoms on once-daily PPIs for at least 4 weeks were assigned to the PPI success group ( n = 13). We collected demographic data and subjects completed the short-form 36 and the GERD health-related quality of life questionnaires. Patients then underwent upper endoscopy and combined esophageal impedance-pH monitoring while on PPI therapy. Four patients in the PPI success group ( 31 %) and 4 patients in the PPI failure group ( 25 %) had abnormal results from the pH test ( P = 1.00). Most of the patients in the PPI failure group ( 75 %) were found to have either functional heartburn or reflux hypersensitivity<disease> with GERD. Impedance and pH parameters did not differ significantly between the PPI failure and success group. We found no difference in reflux characteristics between patients with GERD who had successful vs failed once-daily PPI therapy. Most patients in the PPI failure group ( 75 %) had functional esophageal disorders.
