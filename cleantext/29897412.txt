  MicroRNAs play critical roles in oncogenesis by targeting a few key regulators or a large cohort of genes impinging on downstream signaling pathways. Conversely , miRNA activity is also titrated by ceRNA such as lncRNA with sponge effect. Web-based server , miRNACancerMap , aims to unravel lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA tripartite complexity to predict the function and clinical relevance of miRNA with network perspective. In conjunction with large-scale data and information integration , miRNACancerMap implements various algorithms and pipelines to construct dynamic miRNA-centered network with rigorous Systems Biology approaches and the state-of-the-art visualization tool. The capability of the server to generate testable hypotheses was exemplified with cases to identify hub miRNAs regulating most of the differentially-expressed genes involved in cancer stage transition , miRNA-TF pairs shared by pan-cancers , and lncRNA sponges validated by multiple datasets. LncRNAs sharing the same miRNAs binding sites as mRNAs can sequester miRNAs and indirectly regulate the activity of the related mRNAs. We have re-annotated traditional microarray chips , and included these datasets in the server to enable validation of the predicted lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulations derived from TCGA RNA-seq data. Of note , our server enables identifying miRNAs associated with cancer signaling pathways , and related lncRNA sponges from pan-cancers with only a few mouse clicks. http://cis.hku.hk/miRNACancerMAP. jzhang1@hku.hk.
