  OBJECTIVE To estimate the cost of a case of retained fetal membranes<symptom> ( RFM) for dairy herds in the United States. DESIGN Deterministic computer-based spreadsheet analysis. SAMPLE Inputs from published studies and reports. PROCEDURES Economic losses attributable to RFM were direct ( reduction in milk yield and longer interval until pregnancy) and indirect ( increased risk of developing clinical disease and increased culling risk). Cost attributable to milk<symptom> loss<symptom> was calculated as the mean marginal loss of milk<symptom> production<symptom> for cows with RFM and cows with RFM complicated by metritis. Cost of the increased risk of developing clinical disease because of RFM was a product of the cost of each clinical disease and the risk of each clinical disease attributable to RFM. Cost attributable to reduced reproductive performance was a function of a longer interval until pregnancy , whereas cost for increased culling attributable to RFM was associated with the market value of cull cows and replacement heifers as well as herd turnover rate. RESULTS Cost of a case of RFM determined by use of default inputs was $ 386 ( reduction in milk yield , $ 287; increased time until pregnancy , $ 73; increased disease risk , $ 25; and increased culling risk , $ 1). Sensitivity analysis revealed that milk and feed prices were the most influential inputs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Cost of a case of RFM , including uncomplicated cases , was substantial and comparable to that for other common clinical diseases during the transition period. Preventive measures during the nonlactating period should be considered to minimize the incidence of RFM.
