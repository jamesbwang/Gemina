  Bcr-Abl inhibitors paved the way of targeted therapy epoch. Imatinib was the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor to be discovered with high specificity for Bcr-Abl protein resulting from t ( 9 , 22)- derived Philadelphia chromosome. Although the specific targeting of that oncoprotein , several Bcr-Abl-dependent and Bcr-Abl-independent mechanisms of resistance to imatinib arose after becoming first-line therapy in chronic myelogenous leukemia<disease> ( CML) treatment.Consequently , new specific drugs , namely dasatinib , nilotinib , bosutinib , and ponatinib , were rationally designed and approved for clinic to override resistances. Imatinib fine mechanisms of action had been elucidated to rationally develop those second- and third-generation inhibitors. Crystallographic and structure-activity relationship analysis , jointly to clinical data , were pivotal to shed light on this topic. More recently , preclinical evidence on bafetinib , rebastinib , tozasertib , danusertib , HG-7-85-01 , GNF-2 , and 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives lay promising foundations for better inhibitors to be approved for clinic in the near future.Notably , structural mechanisms of action and drug design exemplified by Bcr-Abl inhibitors have broad relevance to both break through resistances in CML treatment and develop inhibitors against other kinases as targeted chemotherapeutics.
