  To investigate the role of autophagy in the regulatory effect of Shufeng Huoxue Fumula ( SFHXF) on the proliferation and melanin metabolism in cultured murine B16 melanoma cells. B16 cells were treated with solutions containing 0.12 , 0.25 , 0.49 , 0.98 , or 1.96 mg/mL SFHXF preparations , rapamycin ( an autophagy inducer) , or rapamycin + SFHXF. The changes in the proliferation of B16 cells were assessed using MTT assay , and tyrosinase activity and melanin content in the cells were determined. The expressions of autophagy-related proteins P62 , p-mTOR , LC3B , and beclin 1 in the cells were detected using Western blotting. Compared with the blank control cells , treatments with SFHXF both in the presence and in the absence of rapamycin concentration-dependently inhibited the cell proliferation ( P < 0.05) and obviously increased tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis in B16 cells ( P < 0.05); 0.98 mg/mL SFHLF , rapamycin +0.98 mg/mL SFHXF , and 50 nmol/L rapamycin all significantly up-regulated the expressions of LC3B-II and beclin 1 and down-regulated the expressions of P62 and p-mTOR in the cells. SFHXF can regulate melanin metabolism and enhance tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis through the autophagy pathway to inhibit the proliferation of B16 cells in vitro.
