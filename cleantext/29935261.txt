  Induction of mild mitochondrial uncoupling is protective in a variety of disorders; however , it is unclear how to recognize the mild mitochondrial uncoupling induced by chemical mitochondrial uncouplers. The aim of the present study is to identify the pharmacological properties of mitochondrial uncoupling induced by mitochondrial uncouplers in cardiomyocytes. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured. Protein levels were measured by using western blot technique. The whole cell respiratory function was determined by using high-resolution respirometry. The typical types of chemical mitochondrial uncouplers , carbonyl cyanide 4- ( trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone ( FCCP) , niclosamide , and BAM15 , induced biphasic change of STAT3 activity in cardiomyocytes , activating STAT3 at low dose and inhibiting STAT3 at high dose , though the dose range of these drugs was distinct. Low-dose uncouplers induced STAT3 activation through the mild increase of mitochondrial ROS ( mitoROS) generation and the subsequent JAK/STAT3 activation in cardiomyocytes. However , high-dose uncouplers induced inhibition of STAT3 , decrease of ATP production , and cardiomyocyte death. High-dose uncouplers induced STAT3 inhibition through the excessive mitoROS generation and the decreased ATP- induced AMPK activation. Low-dose mitochondrial uncouplers attenuated doxorubicin ( DOX)- induced STAT3 inhibition and cardiomyocyte death , and activated STAT3 contributed to the cardioprotection of low-dose mitochondrial uncouplers. Uncoupler-induced mild mitochondrial uncoupling in cardiomyocytes is characterized by STAT3 activation and ATP increase whereas excessive mitochondrial uncoupling is characterized by STAT3 inhibition , ATP decrease and cell injury. Development of mitochondrial uncoupler with optimal dose window of inducing mild uncoupling is a promising strategy for heart protection.
