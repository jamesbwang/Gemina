  In this work , we explore the possibility of tuning the fluorescence intensity of two porphyrin systems through the electrochemical oxidation of an appended ruthenium acetylide bridge. Two electrochemically switchable systems , a dyad ( ZnP-Ru , 3) and a triad ( ZnP-Ru-P2H , 5) , were prepared and investigated. In the ZnP-Ru dyad , the fluorescence of the zinc porphyrin was switched reversibly between the ON and OFF state upon the oxidation of the ruthenium unit , the most probable quenching process involved after oxidation being the electron transfer from the singlet excited state of ZnP to the oxidized ruthenium center. In the ZnP-Ru-P2H triad , we show that both porphyrins ' fluorescence are highly quenched independent of the redox state of the ruthenium bridge owing to the efficient photoinduced charge transfer within the ruthenium complex.
