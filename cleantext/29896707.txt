  The genome revolution represents a complete change on our view of biological systems. The quantitative determination of changes in all major molecular components of the living cells , the `` omics '' approach , opened whole new fields for all health sciences. Genomics , transcriptomics , proteomics , metabolomics , and others , together with appropriate prediction and modeling tools , will mark the future of developmental toxicity assessment both for wildlife and humans. This is especially true for disciplines , like teratology , which rely on studies in model organisms , as studies at lower levels of organization are difficult to implement. Rodents and frogs have been the favorite models for studying human reproductive and developmental disorders for decades. Recently , the study of the development of zebrafish embryos ( ZE) is becoming a major alternative tool to adult animal testing. ZE intrinsic characteristics makes this model a unique system to analyze in vivo developmental alterations that only can be studied applying in toto approaches. Moreover , under actual legislations , ZE is considered as a replacement model ( and therefore , excluded from animal welfare regulations) during the first 5 days after fertilization. Here we review the most important components of the zebrafish toolbox available for analyzing early stages of embryotoxic events that could eventually lead to teratogenesis.
