  Amyloid infiltration of endocrine glands has been reported , mostly in the thyroid , pancreas , adrenals , and testes , but affected patients do not frequently exhibit overt endocrine insufficiency. Here we report the case of a patient with complete anterior hypopituitarism probably due to a known systemic amyloidosis. Our male Caucasian patient was diagnosed with Crohn 's disease at the age of 22 years. At the age of 37 , he developed secondary renal amyloidosis , which resulted in end-stage renal<symptom> failure<symptom>. He received a living-donor kidney transplant at the age of 57 , without initial complication. Two months later , he developed extreme<symptom> fatigue<symptom> , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , and dyspnea<symptom>. A hormonal evaluation demonstrated complete anterior pituitary insufficiency. A pituitary magnetic resonance imaging was performed and showed a diffusely hypointense anterior gland on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images with reduced gadolinium enhancement , highly suggestive of amyloid infiltration of the pituitary. Treatment was initiated with levothyroxine , orally administered hydrocortisone , and testosterone enanthate , rapidly allowing progressive marked clinical improvement and nearly complete resolution of symptoms. Pituitary amyloid infiltration should be considered in patients with a known systemic amyloidosis who develop symptoms of hypopituitarism and magnetic resonance imaging features compatible with protein deposits.
