  Human γd-crystallin ( Hγd-crystallin) , a major protein component of the human eye lens , is associated with the development of juvenile- and mature-onset cataracts. Evidence suggests that nonenzymatic protein glycation plays an important role in the aetiology of cataract and diabetic sequelae. This research compared the effects of various glycation modifiers on Hγd-crystallin aggregation , by treating samples of Hγd-crystallin with ribose , galactose , or methylglyoxal using several biophysical techniques. To measure advanced glycation end products , an N
