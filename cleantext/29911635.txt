  Aabstract Background and aim Migraine often includes co-existing tension-type headache<symptom> ( TTH) and neck<symptom> pain<symptom> ( NP). Multiple<symptom> headache<symptom> questionnaires assessing headache<symptom> impact have beendescribed previously; however , none of the existing questionnaires have been designed to cover migraine with co-existing TTH and NP. Therefore a new questionnaire was developed to measure these co-morbidities. The aim was to determine face and content validity of the newly developed questionnaire , `` Impact of Migraine , Tension-Type Headache<symptom> and Neck<symptom> Pain<symptom> '' ( impact M-TTH-NP) and to determine face and content validity of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ short form) , Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire ( MSQ v. 2.1) , WHO-Five Well-Being Index ( WHO-5) , Major Depression<symptom> Inventory ( MDI) and Neck Disability Index ( NDI) not yet validated in this target population. Material and methods The new multi-dimensional questionnaire `` Impact M-TTH-NP '' cover pain , triggers , psychosocial , socioeconomic and work related aspects , based on a four-week recall period. The items are rated on an 11-point numeric rating scale with the end points 0 = no impact and 10 = most imaginable impact. Face validity was assessed by migraine patients with co-existing TTH and NP. They were recruited between September 2012 and March 2013 from a tertiary referral headache<symptom> centre. Nine women with a mean age of 38 years participated in group interviews. The questionnaires were reviewed for relevance and meaningfulness. Content validity was assessed by 13 headache<symptom> experts. They had worked with headache<symptom> diseases for an average of 9 ( range , 2-38) years. Experts were recruited between August 2012 and October 2012. Nine medical doctors , two physical therapists , one headache<symptom> nurse and one psychologist ( eight women and five men , mean age of 42 years) participated. The experts rated each item of the questionnaires using a four-point Likert scale with the end points 1 = not relevant and 4 = highly relevant. The quantitative measurement of content validity was calculated by the item-level content validity index ( I-CVI) and the scale-level content validity average method ( S-CVI/Ave). The average deviation ( AD) index was used as a measure of interrater agreement. Results Impact M-TTH-NP showed acceptable face validity. Of 78 items twelve were revised and one was added based on group interviews and expert review. Seventy-two items ( 92 %) obtained I-CVI â‰¥ 0.78 ( range 0.78-1.00) indicating excellent content validity , 71 items ( 91 %) obtained acceptable AD index. Nine items did not meet either the limit for excellent I-CVI and/or acceptable AD index. The overall S-CVI/Ave was 0.92 indicating an excellent content validity. In addition , four of the five additional questionnaires showed acceptable face validity ( MSQ , WHO-5 , MDI and NDI) and three showed excellent content validity ( WHO-5 , MDI and NDI) for patients suffering from migraine and co-existing TTH and NP. Conclusions and implications The impact M-TTH-NP questionnaire showed acceptable face validity and excellent content validity and may be useful when evaluating treatment effect in this target group. The new impact M-TTH-NP questionnaire in combination with the additional questionnaires that together assess pain , triggers , psychosocial and socioeconomic aspects may provide a deeper understanding of the complexity of migraine with co-existing TTH and NP.
