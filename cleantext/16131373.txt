  Synthetic dysfunction observed in cirrhosis results in altered<symptom> production<symptom> of procoagulants and anticoagulants that can lead to both bleeding and thrombotic events , respectively. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis , frequent hospital visits often require bedside procedures such as diagnostic paracenteses , thoracenteses and endoscopy. It can be difficult to determine at what coagulation threshold procedures can safely be performed. Currently , the most common therapies given pre-procedurally include fresh frozen plasma ( FFP) and vitamin K. The effectiveness of these treatments is estimated by international normalized ratio ( INR) , an imprecise measure of coagulation in the setting of cirrhosis. Transfusion with FFP may lead to detrimental side effects , including worsening volume overload and increased portal hypertension. We present a case of a 60-year-old patient intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> secondary to volume overload who subsequently developed bilateral pneumothoraces , requiring immediate chest tube placement. In this case , the patient had ongoing hepatic decompensation with volume overload and acute worsening of coagulopathy with an INR of 4.2. In this setting , 4-Factor Prothrombin Complex Concentrate ( 4F-PCC) was chosen to correct coagulation parameters with a low infusion volume. One hour following administration , INR was 1.5. Chest tubes were placed bilaterally and oxygenation improved without bleeding complications. While the data is still lacking , 4F-PCC may be considered for urgent and emergency situations in cirrhotic patients.
