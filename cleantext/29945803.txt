  Transplantation of mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSC) presents a promising approach not only for the replacement of lost or degenerated cells in diseased organs but also for local drug delivery. It can potentially be used to enhance the safety and efficacy of inner ear surgeries such as cochlear implantation. Options for enhancing the effects of MSC therapy include modulating cell behaviour with customized bio-matrixes or modulating their behaviour by ex vivo transfection of the cells with a variety of genes. In this study , we demonstrate that MSC delivered to the inner ear of guinea pigs or to decellularized cochleae preferentially bind to areas of high heparin concentration. This presents an opportunity for modulating cell behaviour ex vivo. We evaluated the effect of carboxymethylglucose sulfate ( Cacicol
