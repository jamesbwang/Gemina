  Osteo-chondral defects due to advanced osteochondritis of the knee eventually cause osteoarthritis. Autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis ( AMIC) may hold potential for overcoming the treatment challenges raised by defects larger than 2 cm AMIC significantly improves knee function in patients with osteochondritis responsible for osteo-chondral defects grade III or IV in the International Cartilage Repair Society ( ICRS) classification. 13 consecutive patients managed using AMIC between September 2011 and November 2016 were included in a prospective , single-centre , single-surgeon study. There were 8 males and 5 females with a mean age of 29 years ( range , 15-51 years). Among them , 9 had had previous surgery. The ICRS grade was IV in 12 patients and III in 1 patient. The defects had a mean surface area of 3.7 cm After a median follow-up of 24 months ( range , 12-42 months; minimum , 1 year) , 11 patients had significant improvements , with mean increases in the IKDC score and KOOS of 27 and 28 points , respectively. The scores remained stable after the first year. Of the 2 patients with poorer outcomes , 1 had a history of multiple surgical procedures and the other was a 51-year-old female with a defect surface area of 6.9 cm AMIC is a reliable single-stage method that is both reproducible and widely available. AMIC significantly improves knee function scores in patients with large osteo-chondral defects due to advanced osteochondritis of the knee. IV , prospective cohort study.
