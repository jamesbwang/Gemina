  Substance use disorders are an important public health problem with a multifactorial etiology and limited effective treatment options. Within this context , spirituality-based approaches may provide interesting and useful options in managing substance use disorders. This kind of intervention can have positive effects in alleviating some core symptoms associated with substance use , such as aggressiveness. Improvement in cessation rates for alcohol , cocaine and opioid use disorders have also been described in some clinical studies. However , spirituality may not play a beneficial role in some subgroups , such as among individuals with crack cocaine and cannabis use disorders. A widely available intervention for alcohol use disorders is Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA) , which can be seen as a spirituality-based intervention. Spirituality also seems to be especially beneficial for minorities such as Latinos , African-Americans and Native-Americans. Moreover , spiritual-based interventions are also helpful alternatives in many rural environments where conventional healthcare for substance use disorders may not be easily available. However , spiritual-based interventions may be considered as a possible adjunctive therapeutic option to conventional treatments. There is a need for prospective studies outside U.S. , especially where spiritual-based approaches are available. It may be difficult to carry out randomized controlled trials because of the nature of the spiritual/religious dimensions. However , prospective studies that evaluate mediation effect of spirituality and religiosity on recovery would be helpful. Qualitative studies combined with quantitative design offer excellent options to evaluate the recovery process , especially among special populations.
