  Triphenyltin ( TPT) is one of the most toxic chemicals artificially discharged into aquatic environment with human activities. Due to its intensive use in antifouling paints and adverse effects on non-target species , TPT has aroused wide concern in both saltwater and freshwater environment. Nevertheless , the water quality criteria ( WQC) are not available in China , which impedes the risk assessment for this emerging pollutant. This study aims to establish the WQC of TPT for both freshwater and saltwater ecosystems. With the derived WQC , a four-level tiered ecological risk assessment ( ERA) approach was employed to assess the ecological risks of this emerging pollutant in Chinese waters. Through the species sensitivity distribution ( SSD) methodology , the freshwater criterion maximum concentration ( CMC) and criterion continuous concentration ( CCC) were derived as 396 ng Sn L
