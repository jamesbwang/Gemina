  Molecular spin crossover complexes are promising candidates for mechanical actuation purposes. The relationships between their crystal structure and mechanical properties remain , however , not well understood. In this study , combining high pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction , nuclear inelastic scattering , and micromechanical measurements , we assessed the effective macroscopic bulk modulus ( B = 11.5 ± 1.5 GPa) , Young 's modulus ( Y = 10.9 ± 1.0 GPa) , and Poisson 's ratio ( ν = 0.34 ± 0.04) of the spin crossover complex ( Fe
