  Acute stress affects human decision making. It has been argued that there are systematic sex differences in behavioral responses to acute stress , with males showing a ` fight or flight ' and females showing a ` tend and befriend ' response. A ` tend and befriend ' response would suggest that women become more cooperative under acute stress , while men do not. We investigated the effects of acute stress on social behavior. We induced stress via the Trier Social Stress Test ( TSST) and then immediately after measured how participants reacted to offers made in the ultimatum game by a male proposer. We found that female participants were less likely to reject offers under stress ( n = 25) vs. no stress ( n = 37) , p = 0.009 , independent of how fair these offers were , cooperative behavior consistent with the ` tend and befriend ' hypothesis. Male participants when stressed ( n = 30) did not show differences in rejections rates compared to the control condition ( n = 26) , p = 0.41. Our results provide support for a qualitatively different behavioral response to acute stress among men and women.
