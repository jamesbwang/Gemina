  Changes in neuromuscular strategies employed with fatigue<symptom> during multi-joint movements are still poorly understood. Studies have shown that motor variability of individual joints increases when performing upper limb tasks to fatigue<symptom> , while movement parameters related to the task goal remain constant. However , how the inter-limb coordination and its variability change during specific movement phases with fatigue<symptom> is still unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of neck-shoulder fatigue<symptom> on shoulder and elbow kinematic variabilities , shoulder-elbow coordination and its variability , and endpoint characteristics during different phases of a forward pointing movement. Nineteen healthy young adults continuously performed a repetitive pointing task until fatigue<symptom> ( Borg rating of 8/10). Changes in elbow-shoulder coordination through the movement were assessed using the continuous relative phase and statistical nonparametric mapping methods. At the end of the task , muscle<symptom> fatigue<symptom> was evidenced by significant increases in anterior deltoid<symptom> ( +13 %) and biceps brachii ( +30 %) activity. Shoulder horizontal abduction , elbow flexion variability and shoulder-elbow coordination variability were increased with fatigue<symptom> at different moments of the movement cycle ( shoulder: during the first 17 % and most of the second half movement , elbow: from 73 % to 91 % , coordination: almost the whole movement). However , movement timing errors and endpoint spatial variability were mostly preserved , even with fatigue<symptom>. We showed that increased variability with fatigue<symptom> is not only observed in the fatigued joint ( shoulder) , but also in the elbow and shoulder-elbow coordination , and may have a goal of preserving global task performance.
