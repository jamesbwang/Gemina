  The endocannabinoid ( eCB) system is strongly involved in the regulation of anxiety<symptom> and feeding behavior. RVD-hemopressin ( α) ( RVD-hp ( α)) , a N-terminally extended form of hemopressin , is a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid ( CB) 1 receptor and a positive allosteric modulator of CB2 receptor which has been recently reported to exert anxiolytic/antidepressant and anorexigenic effects after peripheral administration in rats. Pharmacological evidences reported a possible link between brain hypocretin/orexin , monoamine and eCB systems , as regards appetite<symptom> and emotional behavior control. Considering this , the aim of our work was to investigated the effects of RVD-hp ( α) on anxiety<symptom> like behavior and food intake after central administration and related it to monoamine levels and orexin-A gene expression , in the hypothalamus. We have studied the effects of central RVD-hp ( α) ( 10 nmol) injection on anxiety-like behavior and feeding using different behavioral tests. Hypothalamic levels of norepinephrine ( NE) , dopamine ( DA) and serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine , 5-HT) and gene expression of orexin-A and proopiomelanocortin ( POMC) were measured by high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) analysis , respectively. Central RVD-hp ( α) administration decreased locomotion activity and stereotypies. Moreover , RVD-hp ( α) treatment inhibited anxiogenic-like behavior and food intake , NE levels and orexin-A gene expression , in the hypothalamus. Concluding , in the present study we demonstrated that central RVD-hp ( α) induced anxiolytic and anorexigenic effects possibly related to reduced NE and orexin-A and POMC signaling , in the hypothalamus. These findings further support the central role of the peptide in rat brain thus representing an innovative pharmacological approach for designing new anorexigenic drugs targeting eCB system.
