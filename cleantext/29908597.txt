  A simple , rapid , and efficient method of dispersive micro solid phase extraction ( D-Î¼-SPE) combined with UV-Vis spectrophotometry via ultrasound-assisted ( UA) was applied for the determination and preconcentration of quercetin in extract of watercress ( Nasturtium officinale) , fruit juice and water samples. The sorbent in this method was synthesized by doping copper and sulfide into the tetragonal structure of SnO
