  Basal like breast cancer ( BLBC) is a very aggressive subtype of breast cancer giving few chances of survival , against which cisplatin based therapy is a compromise among the anticancer activity , the resistance development and the severe side effects. With the aim of finding new anticancer agents alternative to cisplatin , seven gold ( I) azolate/phosphane compounds were evaluated in vitro by MTT tests in human MDA-MB-231 , human mammary epithelial HMLE cells overexpressing FoxQ1 , and murine A17 cells as models of BLBC. Two compounds , ( 4,5-dichloro-1H-imidazolate-1-yl)- ( triphenylphosphane)- gold ( I) 1 and ( 4,5-dicyano-1H-imidazolate-1-yl)- ( triphenylphosphane)- gold ( I) 2 were found very active and chosen for an in vivo study in A17 tumors transplanted in syngeneic mice. The compounds resulted to be more active than cisplatin , less nephrotoxic and generally more tolerated by the mice. This study also provides evidence that both gold ( I) complexes inhibited the 19 S proteasome-associated deubiquitinase USP14 and induced apoptosis , while compound 1 's mechanism of action depends also on its ability to down-regulate key molecules governing cancer growth and progression , such as STAT3 and Cox-2.
