  Imatinib ( IM) is a first-line therapeutic drug for chronic myeloid leukemia<disease> ( CML) , a hematological disease. Mutations in the BCR-ABL domain increase formation of IM resistance in CML. However , not all patients are BCR-ABL domain-mutant dependent. Investigating non-mutant mechanisms in the development of acquired IM resistance is a critical issue. We explored the mechanisms which influence IM efficacy and resistance in CML. Higher protective autophagy was identified in IM-resistant K562 ( K562R) cells. Inhibition of autophagy by the inhibitors , chloroquine and 3-methyladenine , enhanced IM 's efficacy in K562R cells. In addition , microRNA ( miR) -199 a/b -5 p were downregulated in K562R cells compared to parent cells. Overexpression of miR-199a/ b-5p reduced autophagy and induced cell apoptosis , resulting in enhanced IM 's efficacy in K562R cells. Moreover , expression levels of the Wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 2 ( WNT2) , a positive regulator of autophagy , were significantly higher in K562R cells , and it was validated as a direct target gene of miR-199a/ b-5p. Overexpressions of miR-199a/ b-5p inhibited WNT2 downstream signaling. Furthermore , overexpression and knockdown of WNT2 influenced autophagy formation and CML drug sensitivity to IM. Overexpression of WNT2 could also reverse miR-199a/ b-5p-enhanced IM efficacy in K562R cells. These results emphasized that miR-199a/ b-5p inhibited autophagy via repressing WNT2 signaling and might provide novel therapeutic strategies for future IM-resistant CML therapy and drug development.
