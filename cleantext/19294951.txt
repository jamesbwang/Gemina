  ( 1) Background: The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of sleep extension in professional rugby players. The aims were to: ( i) characterise sleep quantity in elite rugby players and determine changes in immune function and stress hormone secretion during a pre-season training programme; ( ii) evaluate the efficacy of a sleep extension intervention in improving sleep , markers of physical stress , immune function and performance. ( 2) Methods: Twenty five highly trained athletes from a professional rugby team ( age ( mean ± SD) 25 ± 2.7 years; height 1.87 ± 0.07 m; weight 105 ± 12.1 kg) participated in a six week pre-post control-trial intervention study. Variables of sleep , immune function , sympathetic nervous activity , physiological stress and reaction times were measured. ( 3) Results: Sleep extension resulted in a moderate improvement in sleep quality scores ( ( mean; ± 90 % confidence limits) & minus; 24.8 %; ± 54.1 %) and small to moderate increases in total sleep time ( 6.3 %; ± 6.3 %) and time in bed ( 7.3 %; ± 3.6 %). In addition , a small decrease in cortisol ( & minus; 18.7 %; ± 26.4 %) and mean reaction times ( & minus; 4.3 %; ± 3.1 %) was observed following the intervention , compared to the control. ( 4) Conclusions: Professional rugby players are at risk of poor sleep during pre-season training , with concomitant rises in physical stress. Implementing a sleep extension programme among professional athletes is recommended to improve sleep , with beneficial changes in stress hormone expression and reaction time performance.
