  In this review , we give an overview of the current state of microfluidic-based high-throughput drug assays. In this highly interdisciplinary research field , various approaches have been applied to high-throughput drug screening , including microtiter plate , droplets microfluidics as well as continuous flow , diffusion and concentration gradients-based microfluidic drug assays. Therefore , we reviewed over 100 recent publications in the field and sorted them according to their
