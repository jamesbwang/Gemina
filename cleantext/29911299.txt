  The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA) played an important role in the establishment of new tissue banks and the improvement of already existing ones in Latin America. The Agency strongly supported , through regional , interregional and national technical cooperation projects , providing equipment , expert missions and training for the production and application of human tissues for transplantation. From 1999 to 2005 five regional courses were given in Buenos Aires under the modality of 1-year distance learning training courses and 1-week face to face courses. The courses were organized by the IAEA , through the National Atomic Energy Commission ( CNEA) and the Faculty of Medicine of Buenos Aires University as Post Graduate Specialization Course. In 2005 the Latin American countries joined with Spain and Portugal , and created the Ibero American Network Council of Donation and Transplant ( Red Consejo Iberoamericano de Donaci√≥n y Trasplantes-RCIDT). The objective of this network is to cooperate among twenty-one Ibero American countries in organizational and legislative aspects , training of professionals , and ethical and social issues related to the donation and transplantation of organs , tissues and cells. The members of this Network work actively to harmonize the regulations and the control of donation and transplantation of human organs , tissues and cells. At present , in Latin America , more than 220 facilities of tissues banks are operating and tissue allografts are being produced by single and multi-tissue banks. The efforts made by the governments and professionals from the region allow the tissue banks to operate under quality systems and introduce new technologies.
