  How graphene influences the behavior of living cells or tissues remains a critical issue for its application in biomedical studies , despite the general acceptance that graphene is biocompatible. While direct contact between cells and graphene is not a requirement for all biomedical applications , it is often mandatory for biosensing. Therefore , it is important to clarify whether graphene impedes the ability of cells to interact with biological elements in their environment. Here , a systematic study is reported to determine whether applying graphene on top of matrix substrates masks interactions between these substrates and retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs). Six different platforms are tested for primary RGC cultures with three platforms comprised of matrix substrates compatible with these neurons , and another three having a layer of graphene placed on top of the matrix substrates. The results demonstrate that graphene does not impede interactions between RGCs and underlying substrate matrix , such that their positive or negative effects on neuron viability and vitality are retained. However , direct contact between RGCs and graphene reduces the number , but increases basal activity , of functional cation channels. The data indicate that , when proper baselines are established , graphene is a promising biosensing material for in vitro applications in neuroscience.
