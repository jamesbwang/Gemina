  To review data and results from past surveys of prosthodontists sponsored and conducted by the American College of Prosthodontists ( ACP). Specifically , results are examined and presented from the most recently conducted survey in 2017. Trends and changes in characteristics impacting the private practice of prosthodontists over time are discussed using results from six surveys completed in 2002 , 2005 , 2008 , 2011 , 2014 , and 2017. Results from the past surveys of prosthodontists are statistically examined and used to estimate several characteristics of the current population of practicing prosthodontists. The selected characteristics include age , gender , hours in the practice , employment of staff , referral sources , and financial conditions ( e.g. , gross receipts , expenses in the practice , and net income of prosthodontists). While the most recent survey was conducted during the year 2017 , the respondents reported survey data for the previous year of 2016. The average age of private practice respondents in 2016 was 50 years; 23 years since graduation from dental school and 18 years since completion of residency; an average of 18 years since starting practice as a prosthodontist , with 52 % in solo practice. The mean number of hours per week in the practice was 33.9 hours and the mean number of hours treating patients averaged 28.3 hours per week. The single largest source of referrals is the prosthodontist 's patients ( 24.8 %) , while general practitioners are a close second source of referrals ( 21.8 %). Salaries paid by prosthodontic practices reached 55 % of total practice expenses. The mean nominal net income in 2016 of prosthodontists in private practice was $ 231,140 while the mean total net income from all prosthodontic sources was $ 263,850. Changes have continued to take place in the private practice of prosthodontics during most of the last decade. The average age of prosthodontists has declined since 2010. Hours in practice and hours treating patients have declined at a rate of about 1 % per year since 2001. Mean net earnings of prosthodontists have declined at a rate of 1.6 % since 2001 and 3.1 % per year since 2007. The prosthodontist private practice industry , not unlike dentistry as a whole , has undergone economic and practice challenges that have affected the conditions of private practice during the last decade.
