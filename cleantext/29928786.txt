  Olive fruit is a significant and promising source of potential bioactive compounds such as oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol. Oleuropein is the ester of elenolic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethanol ( HT). It is the main glycoside in olives , the degradation of which results in the formation of hydroxytyrosol in olive oil. Both plays a significant role in the reduction of coronary heart diseases and a certain type of cancers. Both olive oil phenols have an effective role counter to cell proliferation , cell growth , migration , invasion , and angiogenesis. They down regulate the expression of BCL-2 and COX-2 proteins , and reduced DNA damage. Hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein inhibited the multiple stages in colon carcinogenesis; initiation , promotion , and metastasis. They also provide protection against various human cancers including colorectal , skin , breast , thyroid , digestive , lung , brain , blood , and cervical. This review article discusses the anticancer perspectives and mechanisms of oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol in cell cultures and animal and human studies.
