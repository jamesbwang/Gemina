  The bio-chemical and physical characteristics of a river are directly affected by water temperature , which thereby affects the overall health of aquatic ecosystems. It is a complex problem to accurately estimate water temperature. Modelling of river water temperature is usually based on a suitable mathematical model and field measurements of various atmospheric factors. In this article , the air-water temperature relationship of the Missouri River is investigated by developing three different machine learning models ( Artificial Neural Network ( ANN) , Gaussian Process Regression ( GPR) , and Bootstrap Aggregated Decision Trees ( BA-DT)). Standard models ( linear regression , non-linear regression , and stochastic models) are also developed and compared to machine learning models. Analyzing the three standard models , the stochastic model clearly outperforms the standard linear model and nonlinear model. All the three machine learning models have comparable results and outperform the stochastic model , with GPR having slightly better results for stations No. 2 and 3 , while BA-DT has slightly better results for station No. 1. The machine learning models are very effective tools which can be used for the prediction of daily river temperature.
