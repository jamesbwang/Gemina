  Crossmodal assimilation effect refers to the prominent phenomenon by which ensemble mean extracted from a sequence of task-irrelevant distractor events , such as auditory intervals , assimilates/biases the perception ( such as visual interval) of the subsequent task-relevant target events in another sensory modality. In current experiments , using visual Ternus display , we examined the roles of temporal reference , materialized as the time information accumulated before the onset of target event , as well as the attentional modulation in crossmodal temporal interaction. Specifically , we examined how the global time interval , the mean auditory inter-intervals and the last interval in the auditory sequence assimilate and bias the subsequent percept of visual Ternus motion ( element motion vs. group motion). We demonstrated that both the
