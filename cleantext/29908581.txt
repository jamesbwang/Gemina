  The skin supports a delicate ecosystem of microbial elements. Although the skin typically acts as a barrier , these microbes interact with the internal body environment and imbalances from the `` healthy '' state that have been linked to several dermatologic diseases. Understanding the changes in microbial flora in disease states allows for the potential to treat by restoring equilibrium. With the rising popularity of holistic and natural consumerism , prebiotics , probiotics , symbiotic , and other therapies are under study to find alternative treatments to these skin disorders through manipulation or supplementation of the microbiome.
