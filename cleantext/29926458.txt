  The DNA origami technique has made its way into various areas of nanotechnology , materials science , biophysics , and medicine. Among the many applications of DNA origami nanostructures , their use as masks for patterning of organic and inorganic materials by molecular lithography has received great attention. Here , we describe a protocol for the self-assembly of ordered monolayers of DNA origami nanostructures on mica surfaces and the subsequent fabrication of regular protein patterns over large surface areas via directed adsorption through the DNA origami mask. While the geometry of the pattern is determined by the shape of the DNA origami nanostructures , protein coverage inside the holes of the mask can be varied from single proteins to dense monolayers by adjusting the protein concentration and cationic strength of the adsorption buffer.
