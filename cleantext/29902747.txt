  Wuhan , a megacity in central China , suffers from frequent aerosol pollution and is accompanied by meteorological factors at both synoptic and local scales. Partly due to the lack of appropriate observations of planetary boundary layer ( PBL) , the associations between synoptic conditions , PBL , and pollution there are not yet fully understood. Thus , systematic analyses were conducted using the fine-resolution soundings , surface meteorological measurements , and aerosol observations in Wuhan during summer for the period 2013-2016 , in combination with T-mode principal component analysis and simulations of backward trajectory. The results showed that the variations of boundary layer height ( BLH) not only modulated the diurnal variation of PM
