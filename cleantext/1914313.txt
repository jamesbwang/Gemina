  Our purpose was to review senior author results of TKA in patients with extra-articular angular deformities ( correction of mechanical axis was performed without an additional procedure for osteotomy). Results of TKA in nine knees with osteoarthritis and associated extra-articular angular deformity of femur were reviewed retrospectively. This group was compare with a with a control group of 20 patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis that underwent TKA without extra-articular deformity. Angulation of deformity in patients was 19 ° in coronal plane ( range 15 ° -25 °) and 12 ° in sagittal plane ( range 8 ° -5 °). Knee Score ( KS) and Functional Score ( FS) were measured pre and post-surgery , likewise arc flexion was reported. Results in KS and FS were correlationed with extra-articular angulation. Duration of follow-up averaged 55 months ( range , 48-63 months). KS Average and FS increased from 50.5 and 38.4 points , preoperatively , to 96.5 and 84.4 points , respectively , at time of following-up. No statistically significant differences in any postoperative parameters were found between the postoperative group of extra-articular deformities and the control group were found. Positive correlation was obtained between deformity degrees and KS. Arc of motion averaged 86 ° preoperatively and 118 ° at time of following-up. No total knee arthroplasty was revised. In our opinion , best management for extra-articular deformities associated to osteoarthritis is to carry out a knee replacement without corrective osteotomy on condition that planification allow to us avoid ligaments insertions , using an extensive soft-tissue balancing in conjunction with a minimally constrained TKA.
