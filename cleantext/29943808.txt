  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) is one of the most lethal and rampant human malignancies in the world. Zerumbone , a sesquiterpene isolated from subtropical ginger , has been found to exhibit an antitumor effect in various cancer types. However , the effect of Zerumbone on the biological properties of CRC , including epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) and cancer stem cells ( CSCs) has not been fully elucidated. Here , we investigated the inhibitory action of Zerumbone on the EMT process , CSC markers , and the β-catenin signaling pathway in the presence or absence of miR-200c. The effect of Zerumbone on HCT-116 and SW-48 cells viability was examined by 3- ( 4 , 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2 , 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The effects of Zerumbone on EMT-related genes , CSCs markers , cell migration , invasion , sphere-forming , and β-catenin signaling pathway were explored. To evaluate the role of miR-200c in anticancer effects by Zerumbone , miR-200c was downregulated by LNA-anti-miR-200c. Zerumbone significantly inhibited cell viability , migration , invasion , and sphere-forming potential in HCT-116 and SW-48 cell lines. Zerumbone significantly suppressed the EMT and CSC properties as well as downregulated the β-catenin. Silencing of miR200c reduced the inhibitory effects of Zerumbone on EMT and CSCs in CRC cells. These data indicated that Zerumbone may be a promising candidate for reducing the risk of CRC progression by suppressing the β-catenin pathway via miR-200c.
