  In the present study , the electrochemical behavior of the antiviral drug tenofovir ( tnf) on a boron-doped diamond electrode ( BDDE) has been studied using square-wave voltammetry ( SWV). The experimental conditions such as the supporting electrolyte composition and the SWV parameters were optimized. Under the optimized conditions , a simple and sensitive SWV procedure for tnf determination was developed in the concentration range of 5.0 Ã— 10
