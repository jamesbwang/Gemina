  Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 ( SGLT2) inhibitors function not only to reduce hyperglycemia but also to ameliorate liver injury and reduce body<symptom> weight. The aim of this study was to examine in which subjects SGLT2 inhibitors are more effective for glycemic control , liver injury , and obesity in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We enrolled a total of 156 subjects with type 2 diabetes who initiated SGLT2 inhibitor treatment after September 1 , 2014 in Kawasaki Medical School ( Protocol No. 2375). We evaluated the alteration of glycemic control , liver injury , body mass composition , and various clinical parameters. SGLT2 inhibitors significantly ameliorated glycemic control and improved liver injury in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors were more effective for liver injury when glycemic control was improved with SGLT2 inhibitors. In multivariate analyses , the amelioration of glycemic control was an independent determinant factor for the improvement of liver damage in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes. The reverse was also correct; the improvement of liver damage was an independent determinant factor for the amelioration of glycemic control. Recovery of liver injury with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment was closely associated with their effects on glycemic control in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes.
