  Sex steroid hormones are thought to affect periodontal tissues. A clear understanding of the effect of the menstrual cycle on oral tissues would be an important milestone in the timing of dental interventions in the future. The aim of this longitudinal , prospective study was to evaluate clinical periodontal parameters and levels of interleukin-6 IL-6 and tumour necrosis<symptom> factor alpha ( TNF-α) in gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF) during the menstrual cycle. Forty-five patients were included in this study. Clinical periodontal parameters and levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were evaluated at three points of the menstrual cycle: menstruation day MD , ovulation day ( OD) and premenstruation day ( PmD). Levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There were no statistically significant changes in plaque indexes or probing depths during the menstrual cycle ( p > 0.006) The differences between OD and PmD for gingival index and bleeding on probing were significant ( OD > MD) ( p < 0.006). Statistically significant differences in TNF-α and IL-6 levels in the GCF were observed during the menstrual cycle ( PmD > OD > MD) ( p < 0.006). Periodontal tissues did not exhibit evident changes , but this study demonstrated that the menstrual cycle affected the periodontium and induced inflammatory situations during the menstrual cycle.
