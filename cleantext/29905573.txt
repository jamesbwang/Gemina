  Enhancer of zeste homolog 2-mediated ( EZH2-mediated) epigenetic regulation of T cell differentiation and Treg function has been described previously; however , the role of EZH2 in T cell-mediated antitumor immunity , especially in the context of immune checkpoint therapy , is not understood. Here , we showed that genetic depletion of EZH2 in Tregs ( FoxP3creEZH2fl/fl mice) leads to robust antitumor immunity. In addition , pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 in human T cells using CPI-1205 elicited phenotypic and functional alterations of the Tregs and enhanced cytotoxic activity of Teffs. We observed that ipilimumab ( anti-CTLA-4) increased EZH2 expression in peripheral T cells from treated patients. We hypothesized that inhibition of EZH2 expression in T cells would increase the effectiveness of anti-CTLA-4 therapy , which we tested in murine models. Collectively , our data demonstrated that modulating EZH2 expression in T cells can improve antitumor responses elicited by anti-CTLA-4 therapy , which provides a strong rationale for a combination trial of CPI-1205 plus ipilimumab.
