  Enhanced radiosensitivity at low doses of ionizing radiation ( IR) ( 0.2 to 0.6 Gy) has been reported in several cell lines. This phenomenon , known as low doses hyper-radiosensitivity ( LDHRS) , appears as an opportunity to decrease toxicity of radiotherapy and to enhance the effects of chemotherapy. However , the effect of low single doses IR on cell death is subtle and the mechanism underlying LDHRS has not been clearly explained , limiting the utility of LDHRS for clinical applications. To understand the mechanisms responsible for cell death induced by low-dose IR , LDHRS was evaluated in DLD-1 human colorectal cancer cells and the expression of 80 microRNAs ( miRNAs) was assessed by qPCR array. Our results show that DLD-1 cells display an early DNA damage response and apoptotic cell death when exposed to 0.6 Gy. miRNA expression profiling identified 3 over-expressed ( miR-205-3p , miR-1 and miR-133b) and 2 down-regulated miRNAs ( miR-122-5p , and miR-134-5p) upon exposure to 0.6 Gy. This miRNA profile differed from the one in cells exposed to high-dose IR ( 12 Gy) , supporting a distinct low-dose radiation-induced cell death mechanism. Expression of a mimetic miR-205-3p , the most overexpressed miRNA in cells exposed to 0.6 Gy , induced apoptotic cell death and , more importantly , increased LDHRS in DLD-1 cells. Thus , we propose miR-205-3p as a potential radiosensitizer to low-dose IR.
