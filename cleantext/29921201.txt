  The interindividual genetic variations in drug metabolizing enzymes effects the impact and toxicity in plenty of drugs. The CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 gene polymorphisms characterized using high resolution melting analysis ( HRMA) in follow-up patients in psychiatry clinic as a preliminary preparation for personalized medicine. Genotyping of CYP1A2 * 1F , CYP2C9 * 2 , * 3 , CYP2C19 * 2 , * 3 and * 17 and CYP2D6 * 3 , * 4 was conducted in 101 patients using HRMA. Genotype and allele frequencies of the CYP variants were found to be in equilibrium with the Hardy-Weinberg equation. The frequency of the CYP1A2 * 1F allele in schizophrenia and bipolar disease was 0.694 and 0.255 , respectively. The CYP2C9 allele frequencies were 0.087 ( CYP2C9 * 2) , and 0.549 ( CYP2C9 * 3) for bipolar; 0.278 ( CYP2C9 * 2) and 0.648 ( CYP2C9 * 3) in schizophrenias. The CYP2C19 * 2 and * 17 allele frequencies was 0.111 and 0.185 in schizophrenia and variant * 2 was 0.117 and variant * 17 was 0.255 in bipolar group. The frequency of the CYP2D6 * 3 allele was 0.027 in schizophrenias. The frequencies for the CYP2D6 * 4 variant was 0.092 and 0.096 in schizophrenia and bipolar groups , respectively. The knowledge in pharmacogenomics and also the developments in molecular genetics are growing rapidly. In the future this can be expected to provide new methodologies in the prediction of the activity in drug metabolizing enzymes. The HRMA is a rapid and useful technique to identify the genotypes for drug dosage adjustment before therapy in psychiatry patients.
