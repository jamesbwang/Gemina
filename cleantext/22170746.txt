  Job insecurity has been associated with impaired self-rated health ( SRH) in cross-sectional studies , but prospective findings with short , medium and long-term follow-up yielded mixed findings. Therefore , the aim of the present study was to assess the long-term association between perceived job insecurity and SRH , after controlling for baseline levels of health status and life-style choices. Furthermore , three different follow-up periods ( 14 , 19 and 24 years) were considered. Data were derived from the prospective population-based MONICA/KORA cohort study ( southern Germany). N = 4356 participants ( 2622 men and 1734 women) , aged between 25 and 64 years at baseline , were included in the sample , mean follow-up was after 19.1 years. Job insecurity , SRH and risk factors were assessed at baseline during three independent surveys ( 1984-1995). SRH was additionally assessed in 2009. The association of job insecurity and impaired SRH at follow-up was estimated using logistic regression analyses. Overall , perceiving job insecurity at baseline was significantly associated with a 20 % higher risk of developing impaired SRH at follow-up in the pooled analysis ( OR = 1.20 , 95 % CI = 1.01-1.43 , p = .034) , even after controlling for baseline SRH , socio-demographic characteristics , lifestyle , clinical and work-related factors. The association was strongest and significant after 14 years ( OR = 1.58 , 95 % CI 1.17-2.13 , p = .003) and weaker and not significant to 19 ( OR = 1.20 , 95 % CI 0.89-1.62 , p = .24) and 24 years ( OR = 0.98 , 95 % CI 0.73-1.32 , p = .89) of follow-up in the fully adjusted models. We found that perceived job insecurity during working life was independently and significantly associated with impaired SRH both cross-sectionally as well as after 14 years , but not after 19 and 24 years.
