  Natural deep eutectic systems ( NADES) are mostly composed of natural primary metabolites such as sugars , sugar alcohols , organic acids , amino acids and amines. These simple molecules have been identified in animals living in environments with extreme temperature amplitudes , being responsible for their survival at negative temperatures during winter. Herein , we report for the first time the use of NADES based on trehalose ( Treh) and glycerol ( Gly) in cryopreservation , as cryoprotective agents ( CPA). The evaluation of the thermal behaviour of these eutectic systems , showed that NADES have a strong effect on the water crystallization/freezing and melting process , being able to reduce the number of ice crystals and hence ice crystal damage in cells , which is a crucial parameter for their survival , upon freezing. Using this NADES as CPA , it is possible to achieve similar or even better cellular performance when compared with the gold standard for cryopreservation dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO). In this sense , this work relates the physical properties of the NADES with their biological performance in cryopreservation. Our comprehensive strategy results in the demonstration of NADES as a promising nontoxic green alternative to the conventional CPA 's used in cryopreservation methods.
