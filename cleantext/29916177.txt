  SILAC ( stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) proteomics enables the relative quantification of proteins in one or more biological samples by mass spectrometry. This technology is based on the metabolic incorporation of heavy isotope-labeled essential amino acids into nascent proteins in vivo. Here , we describe the preparation of SILAC protein samples from planarians , flatworms with high regenerative potential and tissue plasticity. Applications for SILAC proteomics of planarians include the analysis of protein abundances , protein-protein interactions and turnover rates during stem cell-based regeneration and tissue homeostasis.
