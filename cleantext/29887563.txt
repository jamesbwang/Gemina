  Since fragments of concrete can be evidence of crime , a determination of whether or not they come from the same origin is required. The authors focused on nitric acid-soluble components in the fragments of concrete. As a result of qualitative analysis with ICP-MS , it was confirmed that elements such as Cu , Zn , Rb , Sr , Zr , Ba , La , Ce , Nd , and Pb were contained in the fragments. After the nitric acid-soluble components in the fragments of concrete were separated by dissolving them in nitric acid , the concentrations of these elements in the dissolved solution were quantitatively determined by ICP-MS. The concentration ratios of nine elements compared to La were used as indicators. By comparing these indicators , it was possible to discriminate between the fragments of concrete.
