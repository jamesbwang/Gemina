  At low levels , carbon monoxide ( CO) has been shown to have beneficial effects on multiple organs and tissues through its potential anti-inflammatory , anti-apoptotic , and anti-proliferative properties. However , the effect of CO-releasing molecule ( CORM) -3 , a water-soluble CORM , on ischemic stroke and its mechanism of action are still unclear. We investigated the role of CORM-3 in the mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion ( tMCAO). CORM-3 or saline was administered to mice by retro-orbital injection at the time of reperfusion after 1-h tMCAO or at 1 h after sham surgery. We assessed infarct volume and brain water content at 24 and 72 h after ischemia , blood-brain barrier permeability at 6 and 72 h after ischemia , and neurologic deficits on days 1 , 3 , 7 , and 14. Among mice that underwent tMCAO , those that received CORM-3 had significantly smaller infarct volume and greater expression of neuronal nuclear antigen ( NeuN) and microtubule-associated protein 2 than did saline-treated mice. CORM-3-treated mice had significantly fewer activated microglia in the peri-infarction zone than did control mice and exhibited downregulated expression of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule ( Iba) -1 , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α , and interleukin 1β. CORM-3-treated mice had significantly lower brain water content and enhanced neurologic outcomes on days 3 , 7 , and 14 post-tMCAO. Lastly , CORM-3 treatment reduced Evans blue leakage; increased expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β , tight junction protein ZO-1 , and matrix protein laminin; and decreased protein level of matrix metalloproteinase-9. CORM-3 treatment at the time of reperfusion reduces ischemia-reperfusion-induced brain injury by suppressing neuroinflammation and alleviating blood-brain barrier disruption. Our data suggest that CORM-3 may provide an effective therapy for ischemic stroke.
