  We analyzed 69 eastern Tennessee wildlife samples for Baylisascaris spp. during 2011. The prevalence of Baylisascaris spp. in raccoons ( Procyon lotor) was 16 % ( 8/49) , an increase compared to previous surveys in this region. One Virginia opossum ( Didelphis virginiana) had eggs in its feces , indicating that opossums can play a role in Baylisascaris spp. transmission.
