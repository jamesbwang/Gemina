  Due to seasonal changes in the quality and quantity of herbage , the nutrient supply to grazing dairy cows is not always sufficient , which may increase their metabolic load. To investigate the temporal pattern of behavioural changes in relation to concomitant metabolic alterations , we subjected 15 multiparous early lactating Holstein dairy cows ( 24 ( SD 7.4) days in milk) to a short-term metabolic challenge , which we provoked by abruptly withdrawing concentrate for 1 week. Cows grazed full-time and were supplemented with concentrate in experimental week ( EW) 1 and EW 3 , whereas concentrate was withdrawn in EW 2. We analysed milk and blood samples to characterise the metabolic changes and found that the total yield of milk and protein decreased ( p < 0.05) and fat yield , fat-to-protein ratio and acetone content increased ( p < 0.05) from EW 1 to EW 2. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were lower ( p < 0.05) , and concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate were higher ( p < 0.05) in EW 2 compared with EW 1. Apart from ingestive and rumination behaviour and activity , we also monitored the use of an automated brush on pasture. While time spent eating and ruminating increased ( p < 0.05) in EW 2 compared with EW 1 , time spent idling decreased ( p < 0.05). Concomitantly , while time standing and moving increased ( p < 0.05) from EW 1 to EW 2 , walking time decreased ( p < 0.05). The daily proportion of cows using the automated brush decreased ( p < 0.05) in EW 2 compared with EW 1 , as did the duration of brushing per day. In conclusion , grazing cows experiencing a metabolic challenge try to compensate for the nutrient deficiency by increasing eating time , a behavioural element important for short-term survival. Due to the strong impact of weather conditions , we can not currently recommend observation of outdoor brushing activity to address short-term alterations in the metabolic state of grazing cows.
