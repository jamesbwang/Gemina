  BTB ( broad-complex , tramtrack , and bric-a-brac) family proteins are characterized by the presence of a protein-protein interaction BTB domain. BTB proteins have diverse functions , including transcriptional regulation , protein degradation , chromatin remodeling , and cytoskeletal regulation. However , little is known about this gene family in tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum) , the most important model plant for crop species. In this study , 38 BTB genes were identified based on tomato whole-genome sequence. Phylogenetic analysis of BTB proteins in tomato revealed that SlBTB proteins could be divided into at least 4 subfamilies. The SlBTB proteins contains 1-3 BTB domains , and several other types of functional domains , including KCTD ( Potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing) , the MATH ( meprin and TRAF homology) , ANK ( Ankyrin repeats) , NPR1 ( nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related proteins1) , NPH3 ( Nonphototropic Hypocotyl 3) , TAZ zinc finger , C-terminal Kelch , Skp1 and Arm ( Armadillo/beta-catenin-like repeat) domains are also found in some tomato BTB proteins. Moreover , their expression patterns in tissues/stages , in response to different abiotic stress treatments and hormones were also investigated. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of BTB gene family in the tomato genome. The data will undoubtedly be useful for better understanding the potential functions of BTB genes , and their possible roles in mediating hormone cross-talk and abiotic stress in tomato as well as in some other relative species.
