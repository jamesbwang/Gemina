  Multiple myeloma ( MM) is a neoplastic plasma cell disorder with high disease recurrence rates. Novel therapeutic approaches capable of improving outcomes in patients with MM are urgently required. The AKT signalling plays a critical regulatory role in MM pathophysiology , including survival , proliferation , metabolism , and has emerged as a key therapeutic target. Here , we identified a novel AKT inhibitor , HS1793 , and defined its mechanism of action and clinical significance in MM. HS1793 disrupted the interaction between AKT and heat shock<symptom> protein 90 , resulting in protein phosphatase 2A-modulated phosphorylated-AKT ( p-AKT) reduction. Moreover , we observed reductions in the kinase activity of the AKT downstream target , IÎºB kinase alpha , and the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor kappa B , which induced mitochondria-mediated cell death in MM cells exclusively. We confirmed the cytotoxicity and specificity of HS1793 via PET-CT imaging of a metastatic mouse model generated using human MM cells. We also evaluated the cytotoxic effects of HS1793 in primary and relapsed MM cells isolated from patients. Thus , HS1793 offers great promise in eliminating MM cells and improving therapeutic responses in primary and relapsed/refractory MM patients.
