  By taking into account Bruce Bridgeman 's interest in an evolutionary framing of human cognition , we examine effective ( cause-and-effect) connectivity among cortical structures related to different parts of the triune phylogenetic stratification: archicortex , paleocortex and neocortex. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 25 healthy subjects and spectral Dynamic Causal Modeling , we report interactions among 10 symmetrical left and right brain areas. Our results testify to general rightward and top-down biases in excitatory interactions of these structures during resting state , when self-related contemplation prevails over more objectified conceptual thinking. The right hippocampus is the only structure that shows bottom-up excitatory influences extending to the frontopolar cortex. The right ventrolateral cortex also plays a prominent role as it interacts with the majority of nodes within and between evolutionary distinct brain subdivisions. These results suggest the existence of several levels of cognitive-affective organization in the human brain and their profound lateralization.
