  Colorectal cancers result in substantial morbidity and mortality to Australian society each year. The usual investigation for bowel malignancyis optical colonoscopy ( OC) , withcomputed tomographic colonography ( CTC) used as an alternative investigation. The catharsis and colon insufflation associated with these investigations pose a higher risk in the elderly and frail. Risks include perforation , serum electrolyte disturbance , and anaesthesia/sedation risks.Minimal preparation computed tomographic colonography ( MPCTC) eliminates these risks. This paper audits a 6-year period ofMPCTC in an Australian tertiary referral hospital. 145 patients underwent MPCTC during the study period. There were 7 true positives , 2 false positives and 2 false negatives. Analysis of this population indicates a sensitivity of 0.78 ( 95 % CI 0.51- 1.05) , specificity of 0.99 ( 95 % CI 0.97- 1.01) , positive predictive value ( PPV) of 0.78 ( 95 % CI 0.51- 1.05) and negative predictive value ( NPV) of 0.99 ( 95 % CI 0.97- 1.01). These findings are concordant with other published studies. The auditconfirmsthatminimal preparation CT colonography is a reasonable alternative to OC and CTC in detecting colorectal cancer in symptomatic elderly and frail patients , without the procedural risks inherent inmore invasive investigations. For most patients MPCTC ruled out significant colorectal carcinoma with a high negative predictive value. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
