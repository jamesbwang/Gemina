  The clear mechanism of moderate exercise training ( Ex) in attenuating muscle<symptom> loss<symptom> remains elusive in diabetes. We investigated the effects of moderate exercise training on diabetes-induced nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB) activation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Skeletal muscle size and atrophy signaling pathways were examined in type 2 diabetic
