  Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) has been observed in a sizable proportion of the U.S. adult correctional population. Jail administrators must pay particularly close attention to inmates with PTSD symptoms , considering these facilities serve as the gateway to the criminal justice system and inmates with PTSD may pose a risk to themselves , other inmates , and staff. The reality of conducting behavioral health assessments in a jail environment is wrought with significant challenges , including limited time. The current study examined prior research on PTSD screening tools to establish an empirical basis for a practical screen to be used among adults recently booked into local jails. Data from a random sample of 283 adults assessed specificity and sensitivity rates of different combinations of criteria. Results indicated a two-item screen achieved an 86.4 % sensitivity rate as well as an 80.4 % specificity rate. This evidence demonstrates a practical and clinically relevant approach to conducting PTSD screens among adult jail inmates.
