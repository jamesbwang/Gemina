  Microwave breast imaging is a painless and nonradiation method. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the detective capability and feasibility of a prototype of a portable breast cancer detector using a radar-based imaging system. Five patients with histologically confirmed breast cancers with a minimum diameter of 1 cm were enrolled in this study. The antenna array dome of the device was placed on the breast of the patient in a supine position for 15 min per single examination. The primary endpoint was a detection rate of breast cancers. The secondary endpoints were positional accuracy and adverse event. All five targeted breast tumors were detected and were visualized at the sites confirmed by other diagnostic modalities. Among five tumors , one was not detected via mammography because of heterogeneously dense breast and another was a microinvasive carcinoma of invasive tumor size 0.5 mm. No study-related adverse events occurred. The prototype of a portable breast cancer detector has sufficient detective capability , is safe for clinical use , and might detect an early stage breast cancer , such as noninvasive carcinoma. Future developments should focus on further decreasing the size of the machine and shortening inspection time.
