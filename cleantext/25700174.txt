  In single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq) studies , only a small fraction of the transcripts present in each cell are sequenced. This leads to unreliable quantification of genes with low or moderate expression , which hinders downstream analysis. To address this challenge , we developed SAVER ( single-cell analysis via expression recovery) , an expression recovery method for unique molecule index ( UMI)- based scRNA-seq data that borrows information across genes and cells to provide accurate expression estimates for all genes.
