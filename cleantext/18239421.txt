  Chitooligosaccharide ( COS) has shown potential antihyperlipidemic activity in a few studies as a functional food. We investigated the cholesterol-lowering effect and potential mechanisms of chitooligosaccharide capsules ( COSTC) in male SD rats fed a high-fat diet. COSTC could ameliorate serum lipid levels. Simultaneously , the cholesterol-lowering effect is probably attributed to its role in two pathways: upregulating the gene expression and activity of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1) , liver X receptor alpha ( LXRA) , and peroxisome proliferation activated receptor-α ( PPARα) , which facilitates the conversion of cholesterol into bile acid; downregulating the gene expression and activity of enzymes including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase ( HMGCR) and sterol-responsive element binding protein-2 ( SREBP2) and upregulating the low-density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLR) to reduce the denovo synthesis of cholesterol. Studies have suggested that COSTC has potential usefulness as a natural supplement or functional food for preventing and treating hyperlipidemia.
