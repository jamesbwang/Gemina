  Healthcare transition ( HCT) from pediatric to adult-oriented healthcare is ideally conceptualized as a planned , continuous process characterized by communication between multiple stakeholders. However , empirical data is lacking regarding processes through which youth living with HIV<pathogen> ( YLHIV) are actually transitioned to adult care. We conducted a qualitative study to gain a more comprehensive understanding of both pediatric and adult provider perspectives on the HCT process for YLHIV. Our study included focus groups discussions with 24 ( 11 pediatric and 13 adult providers at a comprehensive HIV<pathogen> care center in the Southeastern United States. Providers described YLHIV and their HCT trajectories as diverse and complex. They described three distinct HCT trajectories: the Ideal Transition , the Abrupt Transition , and the De Facto Transition. Providers agreed that the most important determinant of successful engagement in adult-oriented care ( post-HCT) appeared to be consistent prior engagement while in pediatric care ( pre-HCT). In summary , risk for disengagement is not uniform among YLHIV transitioning to adult care , and HCT does not always occur in a seamless or linear fashion. Our data suggest that interventions aiming to improve HCT should be more tailored , focusing intensified efforts on those YLHIV with difficulty maintaining consistent engagement in pediatric care.
