  Thalassemia minor ( Tm) individuals , are generally considered healthy. However , the prognosis of Tm individuals has not been extensively studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognosis of Tm versus controls without β-thalassemia carrier state. A total of 26,006 individuals seeking thalassemia screening at the AOOR Villa Sofia-V. Cervello , Palermo ( Italy) were retrospectively studied. Logistic penalised regression model was used to estimate risk of potential complications and survival techniques were used to study mortality. We identified a total of 4943 Tm and 21,063 controls. Tm was associated with significantly higher risks of hospitalisation for cirrhosis ( OR 1 · 94 , 95 % CI 1 · 30 to 2 · 90 , p = 0 · 001) , kidney disorders ( OR 2 · 11 , 95 % CI 1 · 27 to 3 · 51 , p = 0 · 004) , cholelithiatis ( OR 1 · 39 , 95 % CI 1 · 08 to 1 · 79 , p = 0 · 010) , and mood disorders ( OR 2 · 08 , 95 % CI 1 · 15 to 3 · 75 , p = 0 · 015). No statistically difference in life expectancy between thalassemia minor and control group was found ( HR 1 · 090 , 95 % CI 0 · 777 to 1 · 555 , p < 0 · 590; log-rank test p = .426). This study shows that Tm affects the prognosis of Tm carriers regarding health expectation. Probably , iron overload and anaemia for several years may be at the basis of these effects.
