  There is no consensus on most reliable falls ascertainment method. Therefore , we investigated which method captures most falls among pre-frail and frail seniors from two randomized controlled trials conducted in Zurich , Switzerland , a 18-month trial ( 2009-2010) including 200 community-dwelling pre-frail seniors with a prior fall and a 12-month trial ( 2005-2008) including 173 frail seniors with acute hip fracture. Both included the same fall ascertainment methods: monthly active-asking , daily self-report diary , and a call-in hotline. We compared number of falls reported and estimated overall and positive percent agreement between methods. Pre-frail seniors reported 499 falls ( rate = 2.5/ year) and frail seniors reported 205 falls ( rate = 1.4/ year). Most falls were reported by active-asking: 81 % of falls in pre-frail , and 78 % in frail seniors. Among pre-frail seniors , diaries captured additional 19 % falls , while hotline added none. Among frail seniors , hotline added 16 % falls , while diaries added 6 %. The positive percent agreement between active-asking and diary was 100 % among pre-frail and 88 % among frail seniors. While monthly active-asking captures most falls in both groups , this method alone missed 19 % of falls in pre-frail and 22 % in frail seniors. Thus , a combination of active-asking and diaries for pre-frail , and active-asking and the hotline for frail seniors is warranted.
