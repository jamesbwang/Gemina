  Dermoscopy is a useful tool for the diagnosis of acral melanomas ( AM). However , little is known about the influence of tumor thickness on the dermoscopic findings of AM. To investigate the impact of Breslow thickness ( BT) on the dermoscopic patterns of AM. Data on cases of AM on the glabrous skin were collected from four university hospitals. We investigated the frequency of each dermoscopic feature of AM according to the BT. Statistical analysis was performed to investigate the association between the specific dermoscopic patterns and BT. Multivariable analysis revealed that red ( odds ratio ( OR) 16.482 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 3.605-99.016) , blue ( OR 7.092; 95 % CI 1.707-37.435) , and white colors ( OR 5.048 , 95 % CI 1.152-22.897) were more common in AM with BT > 2 mm. Regarding patterns , atypical vascular patterns ( OR 34.589 , 95 % CI 6.458-305.852) , blue-white veil ( OR 9.605 , 95 % CI 1.971-72.062) , and ulcers<disease> ( OR 5.084 , 95 % CI 1.145-24.152) were more frequently detected in cases with BT > 2 mm. A retrospective study design and small sample size CONCLUSION: This study showed an association between dermoscopic patterns and tumor thickness among patients with AM. Dermoscopy can be a useful adjuvant tool in predicting BT in AM.
