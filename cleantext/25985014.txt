  Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia , and associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. AF surgery is widely used for rhythm control of AF , but previous studies have shown varying results. This study sought to investigate the long-term efficacy of concomitant maze IV ( CMIV) surgery in an unselected AF population and identify predictors of late AF recurrence. In total 144 consecutive patients , who underwent CMIV between January 2006 and December 2010 were enrolled. By data from electronic medical records , registers , and rhythm prints , late AF recurrences and heart<symptom> rhythm<symptom> at latest follow-up were retrospectively registered. All patients still alive were invited to an ambulant follow-up to update rhythm status. During a median ( IQR) follow-up of 7.39 ( 2.67) years , 114 ( 79.2 %) patients had recurrence. The cumulative incidence of sinus rhythm ( SR) without antiarrhythmic drugs ( AADs) was 52.3 % after 1 year. Long-term results after 2 , 5 and 7 years were 47.9 % , 32.6 % and 25.1 % , respectively. At latest follow-up 34.7 % were in SR off AADs. No difference in 10-year event-free survival stratified by recurrence were found ( CMIV in the present cohort provided limited long-term success in obtaining SR.. SAF , longer AF duration , and postoperative ATA were associated with late AF recurrence.
