  In this perspective , we summarize new synthetic approaches for the construction of various polycyclic compounds involving ring-closing metathesis as a key step. In this regard , we used ring-closing metathesis in combination with other popular reactions like Suzuki-Miyaura coupling , Claisen rearrangement , Fischer indolization , Grignard addition , Diels-Alder reaction , and ( 2 +2) cycloaddition reaction etc.. To this end , a variety of functional molecules such as Î±-amino acids , cyclophanes , heterocycles , propellanes , spirocycles , and macrocycles have been prepared. The strategies developed and the molecules prepared here play a key role in designing new materials and also act as lead compounds in drug design. The strategies and tactics developed here are useful to design polycycles , macrocycles , and heterocycles of diverse ring systems.
