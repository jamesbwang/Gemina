  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide. Lifestyle is identified as one of the most important risk factors for CRC , especially in sporadic colorectal cancer. The natural composition of the gut microbiota changes rapidly during the first decade of life. Maintaining homeostasis in the gut is essential as structural and metabolic functions of the commensal microbiota inhibit gut colonization of pathogens. Dysbiosis , imbalance in function or structure of gut microbiota , has been associated with a variety of diseases , such as colorectal cancer. The aim of this review was to investigate the possible links between the dysbiosis in gut microbiota and colorectal cancer , and the potential role of anaerobic gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Based on this review , various studies have shown that some of the gut microbiota such as anaerobic bacteria significantly increased in CRC patients , but we suggest more investigations are required to assess the importance of these bacteria and their metabolites in the pathogenesis of CRC are required.
