  Takotsubo cardiomyopathy ( TC) is definitively diagnosed following the exclusion of acute coronary syndrome<disease>. We aimed to examine the rate of coronary angiography in patients diagnosed with TC and also the outcome of patients with TC diagnosed with or without coronary angiography. We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample database from 2010 to 2014 and identified patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of TC. We compared in-hospital mortality between patients who underwent coronary angiography and those who did not. We also evaluated the association between coronary angiography and in-hospital mortality using a propensity score-adjusted multivariable analysis. Among 22 818 patients diagnosed with TC , 87.4 % underwent coronary angiography and 12.6 % did not. Patients who did not undergo coronary angiography had a higher in-hospital mortality than those who did ( 3.0 % vs 0.9 %; P < .001). Increased mortality in patients who did not undergo coronary angiogram was observed in both male ( 8.0 % vs 2.8 %; P = .03) and female patients ( 2.6 % vs 0.7 %; P < .001) and in patients 61 to 80 years old and ≥ 81 years old , but not in patients ≤ 60 years old. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the lack of coronary angiography was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality ( adjusted odds ratio: 2.92; 95 % confidence interval: 1.52-5.65; P = .001).
