  This column describes the Internet System for Tracking Over-Prescribing ( I-STOP) , New<pathogen> York State 's prescription monitoring program , and its compatibility with HIPAA and Part 2 of Volume 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR). The authors review use of information that is permitted by I-STOP and CFR for health care operations , including disclosure , and present information from the state Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement about appropriate use of the program. Physicians are permitted , for example , to contact other prescribers in I-STOP , even without explicit permission from the patient , an area in which physicians need more training. Common clinical scenarios encountered while navigating I-STOP are described.
