  Due to its protective properties of biological samples at low temperatures and under desiccation , dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO) in aqueous solutions has been studied widely by many experimental approaches and molecular dynamics ( MD) simulations. In the case of the latter , AMBER is among the most commonly used force fields for simulations of biomolecular systems; however , the parameters for DMSO published by Fox and Kollman in 1998 have only been tested for pure liquid DMSO. We have conducted an MD simulation study of DMSO in a water mixture and computed several structural and dynamical properties such as of the mean density , self-diffusion coefficient , hydrogen bonding and DMSO and water ordering. The AMBER force field of DMSO is seen to reproduce well most of the experimental properties of DMSO in water , with the mixture displaying strong and specific water ordering , as observed in experiments and multiple other MD simulations with other non-polarizable force fields.
