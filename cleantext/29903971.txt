  Photosystems I and II convert solar energy into the chemical energy that powers life. Chlorophyll a photochemistry , using red light ( 680 to 700 nm) , is near universal and is considered to define the energy `` red limit '' of oxygenic photosynthesis. We present biophysical studies on the photosystems from a cyanobacterium grown in far-red light ( 750 nm). The few long-wavelength chlorophylls present are well resolved from each other and from the majority pigment , chlorophyll a. Charge separation in photosystem I and II uses chlorophyll f at 745 nm and chlorophyll f ( or d) at 727 nm , respectively. Each photosystem has a few even longer-wavelength chlorophylls f that collect light and pass excitation energy uphill to the photochemically active pigments. These photosystems function beyond the red limit using far-red pigments in only a few key positions.
