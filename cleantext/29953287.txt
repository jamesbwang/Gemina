  Meniscus injuries and associated meniscectomies cause patients long-term pain and discomfort and can lead to joint deterioration. To evaluate a collagen-hyaluronan sponge reinforced with synthetic resorbable polymer fiber for total meniscus reconstruction in a long-term ovine model. Controlled laboratory study. Eleven skeletally mature sheep were implanted with the total meniscus scaffold. At 2 years , explants were evaluated biologically ( radial/circumferential histology , immunofluorescence) and mechanically ( compression , tension) , and articular surfaces were examined for damage. The fiber-reinforced scaffold induced formation of functional neomeniscus tissue that was intact in 8 of 11 animals. The implant was remodeled into organized circumferentially aligned collagen bundles to resist meniscus hoop stresses. Moreover , type II collagen and proteoglycan deposition near the inner margin suggested a direct response to compressive stresses and confirmed fibrocartilage formation. Cartilage damage was observed , but end-stage ( severe) joint deterioration associated with meniscectomy was avoided , even with limitations regarding the ovine surgical procedure and postoperative care. A fiber-reinforced total meniscus replacement device induces formation of functional neomeniscus tissue that has the potential to prevent catastrophic joint deterioration associated with meniscectomy. An off-the-shelf meniscus device that can be remodeled into functional tissue and thus prevent or delay the onset of osteoarthritis could address a widespread clinical need after meniscus injury.
