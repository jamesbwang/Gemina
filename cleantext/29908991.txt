  Despite newly approved treatments , metastatic melanoma remains a life-threatening condition. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic in patients with stage IIIB<pathogen> or IIIC melanoma in the adjuvant setting. DERMA was a phase 3 , double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled trial done in 31 countries and 263 centres. Eligible patients were 18 years or older and had histologically proven , completely resected , stage IIIB<pathogen> or IIIC , MAGE-A3-positive cutaneous melanoma with macroscopic lymph node involvement and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1. Randomisation and treatment allocation at the investigator sites were done centrally via the internet. We randomly assigned patients ( 2:1) to receive up to 13 intramuscular injections of recombinant MAGE-A3 with AS15 immunostimulant ( MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic; 300 μg MAGE-A3 antigen plus 420 μg CpG 7909 reconstituted in AS01B to a total volume of 0 · 5 mL) , or placebo , over a 27-month period: five doses at 3-weekly intervals , followed by eight doses at 12-weekly intervals. The co-primary outcomes were disease-free survival in the overall population and in patients with a potentially predictive gene signature ( GS-positive) identified previously and validated here via an adaptive signature design. The final analyses included all patients who had received at least one dose of study treatment; analyses for efficacy were in the as-randomised population and for safety were in the as-treated population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00796445. Between Dec 1 , 2008 , and Sept 19 , 2011 , 3914 patients were screened , 1391 randomly assigned , and 1345 started treatment ( n = 895 for MAGE-A3 and n = 450 for placebo). At final analysis ( data cutoff May 23 , 2013) , median follow-up was 28 · 0 months ( IQR 23 · 3-35 · 5) in the MAGE-A3 group and 28 · 1 months ( 23 · 7-36 · 9) in the placebo group. Median disease-free survival was 11 · 0 months ( 95 % CI 10 · 0-11 · 9) in the MAGE-A3 group and 11 · 2 months ( 8 · 6-14 · 1) in the placebo group ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1 · 01 , 0 · 88-1 · 17 , p = 0 · 86). In the GS-positive population , median disease-free survival was 9 · 9 months ( 95 % CI 5 · 7-17 · 6) in the MAGE-A3 group and 11 · 6 months ( 5 · 6-22 · 3) in the placebo group ( HR 1 · 11 , 0 · 83-1 · 49 , p = 0 · 48). Within the first 31 days of treatment , adverse events of grade 3 or worse were reported by 126 ( 14 %) of 894 patients in the MAGE-A3 group and 56 ( 12 %) of 450 patients in the placebo group , treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse by 36 ( 4 %) patients given MAGE-A3 vs six ( 1 %) patients given placebo , and at least one serious adverse event by 14 % of patients in both groups ( 129 patients given MAGE-A3 and 64 patients given placebo). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse were neoplasms ( 33 ( 4 %) patients in the MAGE-A3 group vs 17 ( 4 %) patients in the placebo group) , general disorders and administration site conditions ( 25 ( 3 %) for MAGE-A3 vs four ( < 1 %) for placebo) and infections and infestations ( 17 ( 2 %) for MAGE-A3 vs seven ( 2 %) for placebo). No deaths were related to treatment. An antigen-specific immunotherapeutic alone was not efficacious in this clinical setting. Based on these findings , development of the MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic for use in melanoma has been stopped. GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA.
