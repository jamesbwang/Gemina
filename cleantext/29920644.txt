  Our purpose was to explore major vascular and bleeding outcomes in relation to risk and severity scores ( ABCD2 or NIHSS) in patients with transient ischemic attack ( TIA) or acute ischemic stroke ( AIS). This nationwide observational study was based on data from 4 national registries. Outcomes were assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. The total cohort comprised 21 268 patients ( median age 73 years , 47.6 % females). Based on ABCD2-score , the TIA-population ( n = 10 174) was divided into low-risk ( 0-3 p , n = 3463) and high-risk ( 4-7 p , n = 6711). Based on NIHSS-score , the AIS-population ( n = 11 454) was divided into minor ( 0-5 p , n = 8596) , moderate ( 6-10 p , n = 1630) and severe ( â‰¥ 11 p , n = 1228). During follow-up ( mean 1.7 years) , the composite endpoint of stroke , myocardial infarction or death occurred in 3572 ( 16.5 %) of all the patients , and major bleeding in 668 ( 3.1 %) patients. Using low-risk TIA as reference , the adjusted hazard ratios ( HR , 95 % CI) of the composite endpoint were 1.41 ( 1.23-1.62) for high-risk TIA , 1.94 ( 1.70-2.22) for minor , 2.86 ( 2.45-3.34) for moderate and 4.18 ( 3.57-4.90) for severe stroke. When analyzed separately , the association with increased risk remained significant for stroke and death , but not for myocardial infarction. The HR of major bleeding were 1.31 ( 0.99-1.73) for high-risk TIA , 1.49 ( 1.13-1.95) for minor , 1.54 ( 1.08-2.21) for moderate and 2.10 ( 1.44-3.05) for severe stroke. This study confirms the association between severity of the index ischemic stroke and risk of future major vascular and bleeding events , and highlights the increased risk also for patients with high-risk TIA.
