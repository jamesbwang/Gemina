  This study aims to detect hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ)- induced retinal toxicity at an earlier stage through the use of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography device , especially by measuring macular retinal ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer ( RGC-IPL) thickness. In this study , 92 eyes of 46 Caucasian female patients ( mean age 53.6 ± 8.1 years; range 32 to 69 years) who were taking HCQ were assigned to group 1 , while 80 eyes of 40 age-matched Caucasian female control subjects ( mean age 56.1 ± 10.7 years; range 34 to 71 years) were assigned to group 2. RGC-IPL thickness and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness were measured in all subjects by Cirrus high-definition optical coherence tomography model 5000 device using macular cube 512 ¥ 128 and optic disc cube 200 ¥ 200 protocols. We performed an evaluation to see if there was any difference between the measured values of the groups. The correlation between average RGC-IPL thickness measures and cumulative dose of HCQ and duration of use was analyzed. Retinal ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer of group 1 was found to be statistically thinner than that of group 2 both on average and in all segments ( superior , superonasal , inferonasal , inferotemporal and superotemporal) except inferior segment when segmented ( p < 0.05). Additionally , a statistically significant negative correlation was found between the average RGC-IPL thickness and cumulative dose of HCQ ( r = -0.371 , p = 0.001) as well as the duration of use ( r = -0.308 , p = 0.006). Patients taking HCQ were found to have decreased RGC-IPL thickness at an early stage due to retinal toxicity induced by the drug. We think that measuring the RGC-IPL thickness may become an important objective in HCQ screening tests.
