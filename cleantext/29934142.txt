  Mycotoxins , present in a wide range of food and feed commodities , are toxic secondary metabolites produced by a number of different fungi<pathogen> Certain mycotoxins do not readily degrade at high temperatures , therefore are resistant to food processing , and consequently are present in the human and animal food supply. Optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy ( OWLS) was applied for the detection of aflatoxin B1 , in a competitive immunoassay format , to compare the analytical sensitivity achieved with an immunosensor design allowing signal enhancement by increasing the sensor surface through immobilization of gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs) of different size and origin ( obtained by chemical or biotechnological synthesis). The effects of AuNPs median size , the methods of sensitization and the biochemical parameters on immunosensor performace were examined. After optimization of the sensitized sensor surface , an immunosensing method was developed for the analysis of aflatoxin in paprika matrix and the results were compared with HPLC reference measurements.
