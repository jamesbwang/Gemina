  Western medicine is undergoing a transition toward transparency of quality and costs , and healthcare systems are striving to achieve the Triple Aim , a framework for improving the patient experience of care , improving the health of populations , and reducing the per capita cost of healthcare. Meanwhile , there is growing recognition of the impact of social determinants of health and a new federal requirement for nonprofit hospitals to implement prevention strategies. A specialized meal delivery program called Simply Delivered for ME ( SDM) was formed in an effort to improve care and reduce 30-day hospital readmission rates.The Maine Medical Center ( MMC) partnered with the Southern Maine Agency on Aging to offer SDM on a voluntary basis to high-risk Medicare patients already enrolled in the Community-based Care Transition Program ( CCTP) at MMC. We report the results of the 2-year intervention in terms of 30-day hospital readmission rates and cost measures ( ie , return on investment and cost savings). Of the 622 MMC patients who received SDM during the 24 months , the 30-day readmission rate was 10.3 % ( compared with the 16.6 % 30-day rate of hospital readmission at baseline ( ie , before the adoption of CCTP)) for all-cause readmissions. The cost savings for reduced readmissions were $ 212,160. The return on investment was 387 % , or a benefit-cost ratio of $ 3.87 for every $ 1.00 spent on meals. Programs such as SDM may reduce the rate of hospital readmission among high-risk older adults and , thereby , yield lower healthcare costs.
