  To evaluate plaque accumulation , peri-implant soft tissue inflammation<symptom> , and bone resorption in patients with immediately loaded implants supporting fixed full-arch prostheses. A convenience sample of 72 patients treated with fixed full-arch prostheses supported by four to six immediately loaded implants was selected. Bleeding on probing ( BOP) , Plaque Index ( PI) , and peri-implant bone loss were measured. The Sixth European Workshop on Periodontology definitions of mucositis and peri-implantitis were used , and collected data were analyzed using a nonparametric test ( Spearman 's rank correlation). Correlation coefficients ( ρ) were defined as follows: < 0.2 = very weak; 0.2 to 0.39 = weak; 0.4 to 0.59 = moderate; 0.6 to 0.79 = strong; 0.8 to 1.0 = very strong. A total of 331 implants were analyzed. The mean follow-up observation time was 5.8 years ( range: 1 to 14 years); mean PI and BOP were 61.7 % and 21.1 % , respectively; and mean bone loss was 0.89 mm ( standard deviation ( SD) 1.09). The mean probing depth was 1.8 mm ( range: 0.5 to 5 mm). Five patients presented with one implant each affected by peri-implantitis ( 6.9 %) , and 15 patients presented with at least one implant affected by mucositis ( 20.8 %). No correlation was found between PI and bone resorption ( P = .08). Very weak correlations were found between BOP and bone resorption ( ρ = 0.18; P = .001) and between PI and BOP ( ρ = 0.13 , P = .019). The results suggest that plaque accumulation is correlated with peri-implant mucositis; however , plaque accumulation alone does not appear to be associated with bone resorption.
