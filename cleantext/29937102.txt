  This study aimed to adapt a guideline for endotracheal suctioning of adults with artificial airways in the perianesthesia setting in China. This study was guided by the ADAPTE framework. The development process consisted of setup , adaptation , and finalization phases. A heterogeneous consultant panel that included a patient representative was established to contribute guidance and suggestions regarding guideline development. Relevant evidence documents were searched , critically appraised , selected , and synthesized to develop the draft guideline. After revisions , the adapted guideline was evaluated by 20 external reviewers. A 155-page adapted guideline was developed with 26 key recommendations ( including 3 procedure phases and 17 points of care). The adapted guideline provided the best evidence for endotracheal suctioning of adults with artificial airways and supported practitioner decisions about appropriate endotracheal suctioning practices for this population. The study also lays the groundwork for future projects on quality improvement and knowledge translation.
