  Nowadays , treatment of esophageal cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach , in which esophagectomy remains the mainstay. The aim of this report is to assess whether multimodal treatment and minimally invasive surgery have led to a lower morbidity rate and an improvement in survival rates. Retrospective evaluation of 318 patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer including 81 esophagectomies. The periods of 2000-2007 and 2008-2015 were compared , analyzing the prognostic factors that may have an impact in morbidity and survival rate. Major postoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification accounted for 35 % , showing a decrease between the 1. Multidisciplinary assessment of patients with esophageal cancer , as well as better selection and indication of treatment and the introduction of new minimally invasive techniques ( thoracoscopy and triangularized mechanical anastomosis) , have improved the morbidity and mortality rates of esophagectomies , resulting in increased survival rates of these patients.
