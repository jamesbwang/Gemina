  We documented the species composition , seasonal ecology , and impacts of parasitoids and predators of Parthenolecanium corni<symptom> ( Bouch√©) and P. quercifex ( Fitch) ( Hemiptera: Coccidae) in the urban landscapes of Georgia , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Virginia , United States. Twenty-one parasitoid morphospecies and 12 predator species were collected through rearing , beat sheet , and sticky card trapping. Coccophagus lycimnia ( Walker) ( Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) was the most abundant parasitoid species in South Carolina , North Carolina , and Virginia , whereas Metaphycus sp. 2 ( Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) was the most abundant species in Georgia. Parasitism rates ranged from 59 to 92 % in the nymphal population and 27 to 84 % in the adult population in South Carolina. Blastothrix sp. 1 ( Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) , C. lycimnia , Encyrtus sp. 1 ( Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) , Eunotus sp. , and Pachyneuron sp. ( both Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) emerged from adult scale insects and significantly reduced the fecundity of parasitized scale insects. Coccophagus lycimnia was the only parasitoid species emerged from nymphs. Hyperaspis signata ( Olivier) species group , Chilocorus stigma Say ( both Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) , and Chrysoperla rufilabris ( Burmeister) ( Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) were the most abundant predators in South Carolina. The majority of natural enemies ( 87 % of parasitoids and 82 % of predators) were active from late March to late August and from late April to late October , respectively.
