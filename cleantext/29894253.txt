  Decision making through multidisciplinary teams offers an opportunity to improve perioperative care for high-risk surgical patients. While multidisciplinary team decision making is commonplace in the NHS , involvement of perioperative physicians including anaesthetists and intensivists in this process is not well established. This article presents an exemplar of anaesthetic and intensivist involvement in a joint perioperative upper gastrointestinal cancer multidisciplinary team meeting at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford , UK. It is hoped that this model example and critical analysis will assist others who are interested in improving perioperative shared decision making in their units.
