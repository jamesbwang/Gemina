  A quarter of a century has passed since Lotus japonicus<pathogen> was proposed as a model legume because of its suitability for molecular genetic studies. Since then , a comprehensive set of genetic resources and tools has been developed , including recombinant inbred lines , a collection of wild accessions , published mutant lines , a large collection of mutant lines tagged with LORE1 insertions , cDNA clones with expressed sequence tag ( EST) information , genomic clones with end-sequence information , and a reference genome sequence. Resource centers in Japan and Denmark ensure easy access to data and materials , and the resources have greatly facilitated L. japonicus<pathogen> research , thereby contributing to the molecular understanding of characteristic legume features such as endosymbiosis. Here , we provide detailed instructions for L. japonicus<pathogen> cultivation and describe how to order materials and access data using the resource center websites. The comprehensive overview presented here will make L. japonicus<pathogen> more easily accessible as a model system , especially for research groups new to L. japonicus<pathogen> research.
