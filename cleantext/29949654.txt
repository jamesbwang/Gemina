  The primary goal of this investigation is to determine the current national standards for time to treatment initiation ( TTI) in soft tissue sarcoma<disease> ( STS). Additionally , we aim to identify the variables affecting TTI variability in STS. An analysis of the National Cancer Database identified 41529 patients diagnosed with STS between 2004 and 2013. Kruskall-Wallis tests identified differences between covariates regarding TTI. Negative binomial regression models identified variables that independently influenced TTI , and adjusted for confounders. The median TTI was 22.0 days and the mean TTI was 29.7 days. Longer TTI was correlated with transitions in care between institutions ( Incidence rate ratio ( IRR) = 1.76; P < 0.001) , neoadjuvant radiotherapy ( IRR = 1.53; P < 0.001) , neoadjuvant systemic therapy ( IRR = 1.40; P < 0.001) , treatment at an academic center ( IRR = 1.23; P < 0.001) , Medicaid ( IRR = 1.18; P < 0.001) , being uninsured ( IRR = 1.13; P = 0.001) , and Medicare ( IRR = 1.05 P = 0.016) status. Shorter TTI was correlated with tumor size > 5 cm ( IRR = 0.93; P < 0.001) , high grade ( IRR = 0.92; P = 0.015) , truncal tumor site ( IRR = 0.94; P = 0.003) , and median income > $ 63000 ( IRR = 0.95; P = 0.028). The median TTI in the United States for STS is 22 days. Increased TTI in STS are associated with tumor and treatment characteristics , socio-economic factors and hospital systems issues. Transitions in care between institutions are responsible for the greatest increases.
