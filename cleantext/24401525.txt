  Arch bars are commonly used in maxillofacial surgery but their intraoral presence for an extremely long period is quite uncommon or rare. So when such a patient reports and denies having any complaints all these years , the question that presents is , how is this possible? What kept the patient so long? A review of the existing literature shows , despite being common in trauma care , failure to follow-up has not received the due attention. This study retrospectively reviews the various factors implicated for failure to follow-up and the proposed corrective measures. The objective is to identify such potential patients beforehand thereby facilitating efficient trauma care.
