  Addiction has been proposed as a ` reward deficient ' state , which is compensated for with substance use. There is growing evidence of dysregulation in the opioid system , which plays a key role in reward , underpinning addiction. Low levels of endogenous opioids are implicated in vulnerability for developing alcohol dependence ( AD) and high mu-opioid receptor ( MOR) availability in early abstinence is associated with greater craving. This high MOR availability is proposed to be the target of opioid antagonist medication to prevent relapse. However , changes in endogenous opioid tone in AD are poorly characterised and are important to understand as opioid antagonists do not help everyone with AD. We used (
