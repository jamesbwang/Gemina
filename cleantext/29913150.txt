  Pulmonary<disease> fibrosis<disease> ( PF) is a fatal respiratory<disease> disease<disease> with no effective medical treatments available. TGF-Î²/Smads signaling has been implicated to play an essential in the pathogenesis of PF , in which Smad3 act as the integrator of pro-fibrosis signals. In this study , we determined the effect of SIS3 , a specific inhibitor of Smad3 , in an experimental mouse model of lung<disease> fibrosis<disease>. We observed that SIS3 treatment significantly reduced bleomycin ( BLM)- induced pathological changes and collagen deposition in the lung as indicated by Masson staining , real-time PCR and hydroxyproline content assay. As expected , the levels of Smad3 phosphorylation were decreased in the lung of mice treated with SIS3. Furthermore , SIS3 treatment also suppressed BLM-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lung. Taken together , our results suggest that SIS3 ameliorated BLM-induced PF in mouse lungs. Thus , targeting Smad3 with SIS3 may be an effective approach for treatment of fibrotic disorders.
