  This study investigated how cuttlefish ( Sepia officinalis) camouflage patterns are influenced by the proportions of different gray-scales present in visually cluttered environments. All experimental substrates comprised spatially random arrays of texture elements ( texels) of five gray-scales: Black , Dark gray , Gray , Light gray , and White. The substrates in Experiment 1 were densely packed arrays of square texels that varied over 4 sizes in different conditions. Experiment 2 used substrates in which texels were disks separated on a homogeneous background that was Black , Gray or White in different conditions. In a given condition , the histogram of texel gray-scales was varied across different substrates. For each of 16 cuttlefish pattern response statistics c , the resulting data were used to determine the strength with which variations in the proportions of different gray-scales influenced c. The main finding is that darker-than-average texels ( i.e. , texels of negative contrast polarity) predominate in controlling cuttlefish pattern responses in the context of cluttered substrates. In Experiment 1 , for example , substrates of all four texel-sizes , activation of the cuttlefish `` white square '' and `` white head bar '' ( two highly salient skin components) is strongly influenced by variations in the proportions of Black and Dark gray ( but not Gray , Light gray , or White) texels. It is hypothesized that in the context of high-variance visual input characteristic of cluttered substrates in the cuttlefish natural habitat , elements of negative contrast polarity reliably signal the presence of edges produced by overlapping objects , in the presence of which disruptive pattern responses are likely to achieve effective camouflage.
