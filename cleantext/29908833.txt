  Obesity is a major health problem that is linked to decreased sperm count. It is hypothesized that an obesity-associated reduction in adiponectin secretion may be responsible for impairment of spermatogenesis. Therefore , the aim of the study was to evaluate the direct role of adiponectin in spermatogenesis and steroid synthesis in adult mice. This study showed that adiponectin receptors ( AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) were localized in Leydig cells and seminiferous tubules in the testis of adult mice. The result of the in vitro study showed the direct action of adiponectin on spermatogenesis by stimulating cell proliferation ( PCNA) and survival ( Bcl2) and by suppressing cell apoptosis. Treatment of testis with adiponectin also enhanced transport of the energetic substrates glucose and lactate to protect cells from undergoing apoptosis. Adiponectin treatment further showed a significant reduction in oxidative stress and nitric oxide. Our findings suggest that adiponectin effectively facilitates cell survival and proliferation , as well as protects from apoptosis. Thus , adiponectin treatment may be responsible for enhancing sperm counts. Interestingly , this study showed the stimulatory effect of adiponectin in spermatogenesis but showed an inhibitory effect on testosterone and estradiol synthesis in the testes. Based on the present study , it is hypothesized that systemic adiponectin treatment may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the improvement of spermatogenesis and sperm count.
