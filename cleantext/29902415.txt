  Naphthoquinone derivatives have various pharmacological properties. Here , we describe the synthesis of new 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives inspired by lawsone and Î²-lapachone and their effects on both migration of fibroblasts in vitro and dermal wound<disease> healing in diabetic mice. NMR and FTIR spectroscopy aided characterization of chemical composition and demonstrated the molecular variations after the synthesis of four different derivatives , namely 2-bromo-1,4-naphthoquinone ( termed derivative S3) , 2-N-phenylamino-1,4-naphthoquinone ( derivative S5) , 2-N-isonicotinoyl-hydrazide-1,4-naphthoquinone ( derivative S6) , and 1-N-isonicotinoyl-hydrazone- ( 2-hydroxy-3- ( 3-methyl-2-butenyl)) -1,4-naphthoquinone ( derivative S7). Our results indicate that derivatives S3 , S5 , S6 and S7 were non-toxic to the 3T3 fibroblast cell line. In scratch assays , derivatives S3 and S6 , but not S5 or S7 , stimulated the migration of fibroblasts. Compared with untreated diabetic mice , S3 , S6 and S7 treatments accelerated wound<disease> closure. However , derivative S3 was optimal for the stimulation of epithelization , thereby increasing the number of keratinocyte layers and blood vessels , and reducing diffuse cellular infiltration , compared to derivatives S6 and S7. Our results suggest that novel 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives promote fibroblast migration and accelerate wound<disease> closure under diabetic conditions.
