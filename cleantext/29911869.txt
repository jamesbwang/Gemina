  Most theoretical and simulation studies on charged suspensions are at infinite dilution and are focused on the electrolyte structure around one or two isolated particles. Some classic experimental studies with latex particle solutions exhibit interesting phenomenology which imply very-long-range correlations. Here , we apply an integral equation theory to a model charged macroion suspension , at finite volume fraction , and find an amplitude-modulated charge inversion structure , with outsized amplitudes and of very-long-range extension. These inversions are different from the standard charge inversions in that they occur at finite macroions ' volume fraction , far away from the central macroion , are outsized , and increase , not decrease , with increasing particle charge and distance to the central particle , which is indicative of long-range correlations. We find our results to be in agreement with our Monte Carlo simulations and qualitatively consistent with existing experimental results.
