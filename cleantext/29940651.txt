  Solitary extranevraxial plasmacytoma ( SEP) , as a clinical entity without signs of systemic myelomatosis , is extremely rare; it is difficult to find literature on the issue of patient management and proper course of action in the presence of associated pathology. The authors present a rare case of plasmacytoma of the skull vault associated with severe cardiac pathology , which made surgery extremely difficult and possible only through temporization of the interventions , as presented. We discuss our findings and opportunities for treatment in this case , which seemed unapproachable at presentation , in connection with the associated cardiac pathology. The case was followed-up for eight years with no recurrences.
