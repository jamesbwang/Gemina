  Catalyst-transfer polymerization ( CTP) has emerged as a useful method for synthesizing conjugated polymers with control over their length , sequence , and end-groups. However , the extent to which the polymerizations are living and chain-growth ( or not) is highly catalyst and monomer dependent. Few studies have elucidated the impact of these identities on the stability and reactivity of the key intermediate , especially under polymerization-relevant conditions. We developed herein a simple experiment to identify catalyst stability and ring-walking ability using in situ-generated polymers. The combined results show that the ancillary ligand , metal , and polymer identity all play a crucial role. While each catalyst studied walks efficiently over large distances in poly ( thiophene) , the trends observed for poly ( phenylene) highlight the differing roles of transition metal and ancillary ligand identities. The insights gained herein should be useful for extending CTP to other monomer and copolymer scaffolds.
