  This study investigated the effect of glucose oxidase on the gel properties of threadfin bream surimi. The gel strength of surimi increased with the addition of 0.5 ‰ glucose oxidase after two-step heating. Based on the results of the chemical interactions , the hydrophobic interaction and disulfide bond of glucose oxidase-treated surimi samples increased compared with the control samples at the gelation temperature and gel modori temperature. The surface hydrophobicity of samples with glucose oxidase and glucose increased significantly ( p < 0.05) and total sulfhydryl groups decreased significantly ( p < 0.05). The analysis of Raman spectroscopy shows that the addition of glucose oxidase induced more α-helixes to turn into a more elongated random and flocculent structure. Glucose oxidase changes the secondary structure of the surimi protein , making more proteins depolarize and stretch and causing actomyosin to accumulate to each other , resulting in the formation of surimi gel.
