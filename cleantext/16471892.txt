  In this work , new gelled electrolytes were prepared based on a mixture containing phosphonium ionic liquid ( IL) composed of trihexyl ( tetradecyl) phosphonium cation combined with bis ( trifluoromethane) sulfonimide ( TFSI) counter anions and lithium salt , confined in a host network made from an epoxy prepolymer and amine hardener. We have demonstrated that the addition of electrolyte plays a key role on the kinetics of polymerization but also on the final properties of epoxy networks , especially thermal , thermo-mechanical , transport , and electrochemical properties. Thus , polymer electrolytes with excellent thermal stability ( > 300 & deg; C) combined with good thermo-mechanical properties have been prepared. In addition , an ionic conductivity of 0.13 Ms & middot; cm
