  Brachiaria decumbens<pathogen> is an extremely productive tropical grass due to its aggressive growth habit and its adaptation to a varied range of soil types and environments. As a result of the vast availability , treated B. decumbens<pathogen> demonstrates as a promising local material that could be utilised as an improved diet for sheep and goats. Despite the fact that the grass significantly increases weight gains in grazing farm animals , there were many reports of general ill-thrift and sporadic outbreaks of photosensitivity in livestock due to the toxic compound of steroidal saponin found in B. decumbens<pathogen>. Ensiling and haymaking were found to be effective in removing toxin and undesirable compounds in the grass. Biological treatments using urea , activated charcoal , polyethylene glycol , and effective microorganisms were found to be useful in anti-nutritional factor deactivation and improving the nutritive values of feedstuffs. Besides , oral administration of phenobarbitone showed some degree of protection in sheep that fed on B. decumbens<pathogen> pasture. In this review , we aim to determine the effect of B. decumbens<pathogen> toxicity and possible treatment methods on the grass to be used as an improved diet for small ruminant.
