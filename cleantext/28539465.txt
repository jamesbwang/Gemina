  Next-generation sequencing ( NGS) is a useful tool for detecting genomic alterations in circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA). To date , most ctDNA tests have been performed on patients with widely metastatic disease. Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis ( metastases) present unique prognostic and therapeutic challenges. We therefore explored preoperative ctDNA in patients with peritoneal metastases undergoing surgery. Patients referred for surgical resection of peritoneal metastases underwent preoperative blood-derived ctDNA analysis ( clinical-grade NGS ( 68-73 genes)). ctDNA was quantified as the percentage of altered circulating cell-free DNA ( % cfDNA). Eighty patients had ctDNA testing: 46 ( 57.5 %) women; median age 55.5 years. The following diagnoses were included: 59 patients ( 73.8 %) , appendix cancer; 11 ( 13.8 %) , colorectal; five ( 6.3 %) , peritoneal mesothelioma; two ( 2.5 %) , small bowel; one ( 1.3 %) each of cholangiocarcinoma , ovarian , and testicular cancer. Thirty-one patients ( 38.8 %) had detectable preoperative ctDNA alterations , most frequently in the following genes: TP53 ( 25.8 % of all alterations detected) and KRAS ( 11.3 %). Among 15 patients with tissue DNA NGS , 33.3 % also had ctDNA alterations ( overall concordance = 96.7 %). Patients with high ctDNA quantities ( â‰¥ 0.25 % cfDNA , n = 25) had a shorter progression-free survival ( PFS) than those with lower ctDNA quantities ( n = 55; 7.8 vs. 15.0 months; hazard ratio 3.23 , 95 % confidence interval 1.43-7.28 , p = 0.005 univariate , p = 0.044 multivariate). A significant proportion of patients with peritoneal metastases referred for surgical intervention have detectable ctDNA alterations preoperatively. Patients with high levels of ctDNA have a worse prognosis independent of histologic grade.
