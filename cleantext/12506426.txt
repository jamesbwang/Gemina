  Metabolic products of the intestinal microbiome such as trimethylamine N-oxide ( TMAO) that accumulate in renal<symptom> failure<symptom> ( gut-derived uremic toxins , GDUTs) affect atherosclerosis and increase cardiovascular risk. We hypothesized that patients on a Mediterranean diet and those consuming lower amounts of dietary precursors would have lower levels of GDUTs. Patients attending vascular prevention clinics completed a Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire ( FFQ) and had plasma levels of TMAO , p-cresylsulfate , hippuric acid , indoxyl sulfate , p-cresyl glucuronide , phenyl acetyl glutamine , and phenyl sulfate measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Carotid plaque burden was measured by ultrasound; CKD-Epi equations were used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate. In total , 276 patients completed the study. Even moderate renal function significantly increased plasma GDUTs , which were significantly associated with higher carotid plaque burden. There was no significant difference in plasma levels of any GDUT associated with a Mediterranean diet score or with intake of dietary precursors. In omnivorous patients with vascular disease , the intake of dietary precursors of intestinal metabolites or adherence to a Mediterranean diet did not change plasma GDUT. Approaches other than diet , such as probiotics and repopulation of the intestinal microbiome , may be required to mitigate the adverse effects of GDUTs.
