  Posttransplant diarrhea<disease> is associated with kidney allograft failure and death , but its etiology remains unknown in the majority of cases. Because altered gut microbial ecology is a potential basis for diarrhea<disease> , we investigated whether posttransplant diarrhea<disease> is associated with gut dysbiosis. We enrolled 71 kidney allograft recipients for serial fecal specimen collections in the first 3 months of transplantation and profiled the gut microbiota using 16S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA) gene V4-V5 deep sequencing. The Shannon diversity index was significantly lower in 28 diarrheal fecal specimens from 25 recipients with posttransplant diarrhea<disease> than in 112 fecal specimens from 46 recipients without posttransplant diarrhea<disease> We found a lower relative abundance of 13 commensal genera ( Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P â‰¤ .15) in the diarrheal fecal specimens including the same 4 genera identified in our prior study. The 28 diarrheal fecal specimens were also evaluated by a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) assay for 22 bacterial , viral , and protozoan gastrointestinal pathogens , and 26 specimens were negative for infectious etiologies. Using PICRUSt ( Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) to predict metagenomic functions , we found that diarrheal fecal specimens had a lower abundance of metabolic genes. Our findings suggest that posttransplant diarrhea<disease> is not associated with common infectious diarrheal pathogens but with a gut dysbiosis.
