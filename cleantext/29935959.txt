  Several studies have identified the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR) as a negative regulator of the innate and adaptive immune responses. However , the molecular mechanisms by which this transcription factor exerts such modulatory effects are not well understood. Interaction between AhR and RelA/p65 has previously been reported. RelA/p65 is the major NFκB subunit that plays a critical role in immune responses to infection. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the activation of AhR disrupted RelA/p65 signaling in mouse peritoneal macrophages by decreasing its half-life. The data demonstrate that the activation of AhR by TCDD and β-naphthoflavone ( β-NF) decreased protein levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α , IL-6 and IL-12 after macrophage activation with LPS/IFNγ. In an AhR-dependent manner , TCDD treatment induces RelA/p65 ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation , an effect dependent on AhR transcriptional activity. Activation of AhR also induced lysosome-like membrane structure formation in mouse peritoneal macrophages and RelA/p65 lysosome-dependent degradation. In conclusion , these results demonstrate that AhR activation promotes RelA/p65 protein degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system , as well as through the lysosomes , resulting in decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in mouse peritoneal macrophages.
