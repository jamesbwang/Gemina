  The actions of thyroid hormones on brain development and function are due primarily to regulation of gene expression. Identification of direct transcriptional responses requires cell culture approaches given the difficulty of in vivo studies. Here , we describe the use of primary cells in culture obtained from embryonic mouse cerebral cortex , to identify the set of genes regulated directly and indirectly by T3 using RNA-Seq.
