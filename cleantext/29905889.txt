  Early brain injury ( EBI) was reported to be the primary cause of high mortality and poor outcomes in subarachnoid hemorrhage<symptom> ( SAH) patients , and apoptosis is regarded as the most important physiopathologic mechanism during EBI. Recently , our team found that thioredoxin-interacting protein ( TXNIP) links endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ER stress) to neuronal apoptosis and aggravates EBI. However , the other underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Mitochondria are considered to be the central points in integrating apoptotic cell death. However , whether crosstalk between TXNIP and the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway is effective on EBI has not been previously reported. Therefore , we created an endovascular perforation SAH model in Sprague-Dawley rats to determine the possible mechanism. We found that TXNIP expression in apoptotic neurons significantly increased in the SAH group compared with the sham group. In addition , increased TXNIP expression was accompanied by remarkable changes in mitochondrial-related antiapoptotic and proapoptotic factors. Furthermore , resveratrol ( RES , a TXNIP inhibitor) administration significantly downregulated the expression of TXNIP and mitochondria-related proapoptotic factors. Additionally , it attenuated SAH prognostic indicators , such as brain edema<symptom> , blood-brain barrier permeability , and neurological deficits. Therefore , our study further confirms that TXNIP may participate in neuronal apoptosis through the mitochondrial signaling pathway and that TXNIP may be a target for SAH treatment.
