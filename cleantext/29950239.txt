  To investigate the efficiency of inducing CIK from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMNC) by using immune cell serum replacement ( immune cell SR) , so as to provide a new strategy for the industrialized production of immune cells. The PBMNC of healthy volunteers were collected , and these cells were thawed after short-term cryopreservation and cultured to induce CIK cells. The cells viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion , the phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry , and the cytotoxicity was determined by Calcein-AM/PI double staining. In cryopreserved PBMNC , the control group cells failed to normally proliferate. Cell proliferation ratio was low in 2 % SR group in comparison with the fresh group , and the difference was significant ( P < 0.05) , however , differences were not statistically significant between 5 % SR and fresh group or between 10 % AP and fresh group. CD3 5 % SR without the protein of animal origin can be safely used as a substitute for autologous plasma in CIK induced from cryopreserved PBMNC by culture , thus providing a basis for the application of cryopreservation technique of immune cells to cell therapy.
