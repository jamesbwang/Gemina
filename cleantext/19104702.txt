  Locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) treated by radiotherapy ( RT) may be suited for further treatment with surgery. As a critical mediator of the post-RT immune response , Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4) and its associated proteins may serve as prognostic factors for patients with HCC treated by post-RT surgery. In the present study , a total of 20 patients with HCC treated by post-RT surgery were enrolled. Resected tumor and peritumoral liver tissues were used to construct tissue microarrays that were assessed with immunohistochemical staining for the expression levels of TLR4 , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2). The overall ( OS) and disease-free ( DFS) survival outcomes for each patient were assessed , and the severity of radiation-induced liver diseases ( RILDs) was detected. The patients with low TLR4 or TRAIL expression exhibited significantly better OS times than those with high TLR4 ( P = 0.003) or TRAIL ( P = 0.007) expression , whereas the median DFS times for patients with low VEGFR2 or TRAIL were significantly longer than those with high VEGFR2 ( P = 0.003) or TRAIL ( P = 0.008) expression. No significant differences in OS or DFS times were identified according to the expression of TLR4 , VEGFR2 or TRAIL in peritumoral liver tissue , although more severe RILDs were identified in patients with the high expression of these factors in the peritumoral liver tissue post-RT ( P < 0.05). Therefore , the expression levels of TLR4 and its associated proteins in HCC tumors may be suitable as prognostic factors for patients with HCC treated by post-RT surgery. The inhibition of TLR4 , VEGFR2 and TRAIL expression in HCC and non-tumor liver tissue may lessen the severity of RILDs and improve survival outcomes in the future.
