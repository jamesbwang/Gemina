  Interventions to keep adolescent girls and young women in school , or support their return to school , are hypothesised to also reduce HIV<pathogen> risk. Such interventions are included in the DREAMS combination package of evidence-based interventions. Although there is evidence of reduced risky sexual behaviours , the impact on HIV<pathogen> incidence is unclear. We used nationally representative surveys to investigate the association between being in school and HIV<pathogen> prevalence. We analysed Demographic and Health Survey data from nine DREAMS countries in sub-Saharan Africa restricted to young women aged 15-19 ( n = 20,429 in total). We used logistic regression to assess cross-sectional associations between being in school and HIV<pathogen> status and present odds ratios adjusted for age , socio-economic status , residence , marital status , educational attainment and birth history ( aOR). We investigated whether associations seen differed across countries and by age. HIV<pathogen> prevalence ( 1.0 % -9.8 %) , being currently in school ( 50.0 % -72.6 %) and the strength of association between the two , varied between countries. We found strong evidence that being currently in school was associated with a reduced odds of being HIV<pathogen> positive in Lesotho ( aOR: 0.37; 95 % CI: 0.17-0.79) , Swaziland ( aOR: 0.32; 95 % CI: 0.17-0.59) , and Uganda ( aOR: 0.48: 95 % CI: 0.29-0.80) and no statistically significant evidence for this in Kenya , Malawi , Mozambique , Tanzania , Zambia or Zimbabwe. Although the relationship is not uniform across countries or over time , these data are supportive of the hypothesis that young women in school are at lower risk of being HIV<pathogen> positive than those who leave school in some sub-Saharan African settings. There is a possibility of reverse causality , with pre-existing HIV<pathogen> infection leading to school drop-out. Further investigation of the contextual factors behind this variation will be important in interpreting the results of HIV<pathogen> prevention interventions promoting retention in school.
