  We report a facile bottom-up synthetic approach to preparing ultrathin two-dimensional ( 2D) palladium nanosheets ( PdNSs) with selectively exposed surface facets. Our synthetic strategy is based on the utilization of the nanoconfined lamellar mesophases of amphiphilic functional surfactants to template the growth of PdNSs in aqueous solution. Preferential adsorption of functional groups (
