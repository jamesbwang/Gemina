  To investigate changes in intraocular scattering and Bowman 's layer microdistortions after femtosecond laser small incision lenticule extraction using the continuous curvilinear lenticulerhexis technique ( SMILE-CCL). In this prospective study , 93 eyes of 93 patients ( 44 women , 49 men) were treated with SMILE-CCL. Mean age was 26.09 ± 4.39 years and mean spherical equivalent was -6.31 ± 2.16 diopters. The Objective Scatter Index ( OSI) was examined with an objective optical quality analysis system. Bowman 's layer microdistortions in the central 4-mm optical zone were measured using Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography. The mean OSI value increased from 0.67 preoperatively to 1.09 at 20 days , and then decreased to 0.84 at 3 months ( P < .05). Microdistortions were observed in 62.37 % of the eyes at 20 days and 48.39 % at 3 months postoperatively ( P < .05). The width of the microdistortions per meridian was 283.18 ± 197.19 μm at 20 days; this decreased to 156.00 ± 159.86 μm at 3 months ( P < 0.05). Regression analysis models revealed that older age ( b = 0.02 , P = .03) and higher preoperative spherical equivalent ( b = -0.09 , P < .05) resulted in higher postoperative OSI values; no significant association was found between postoperative OSI values and microdistortion-related parameters ( P > .05). Higher preoperative spherical equivalent ( b = -0.28 , P = .01) and thinner preoperative corneal thickness ( b = -0.02 , P = .01) were associated with more microdistortions. SMILE induced a temporary increase in OSI values and Bowman 's layer microdistortions. The microdistortions did not influence intraocular scattering. ( J Refract Surg. 2018; 34 ( 6): 387-392.).
