  The current study aimed to examine the long-term survival after partial hepatectomy for patients with BCLC intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) stratified by the Bolondi 's sub-staging model. This cohort consisted of 360 patients with BCLC intermediate stage HCC who underwent partial hepatectomy between January 2008 and February 2010. Patients were stratified into 3 subgroups ( B1-B3) based on the Bolondi 's sub-staging model. The last follow-up was conducted at February 2014. Of these patients , 166 , 171 and 23 patients had B1 , B2 , and B3 sub-stage HCC , respectively. The postoperative 5-year Overall survival ( OS) rate for patients with these three sub-stages was 49.5 % , 33.7 % and 12.9 % , respectively ( P < 0.001). Compared with the reported survival outcomes from previous studies which used transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE) as first-line treatment , hepatectomy had a better median survival than TACE in B1 and B2 patients. On multivariable analysis , presence of esophageal and gastric varices , higher NDR score , presence of microvascular invasion , differentiation grade III-IV , and patterns of AFP decreases after surgery were the independent risk factors of OS in the sub-stages B1 and B2 patients. A nomogram which integrated all these independent risk factors was developed , with a C-index of 0.71 for OS prediction. The calibration curve showed an optimal agreement between prediction by the nomogram and actual observation. The patients with intermediate stage HCC clarified as sub-stages B1 and B2 according to Bolondi 's model had an optimal long-term survival following partial hepatectomy than TACE. Their postoperative prognosis could be accurately predicted by our proposed nomogram.
