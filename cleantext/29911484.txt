  It is well described that numerous environmental factors , including exercise , modulate plasma volume ( PV). These modulations prove problematic when a number of haematological markers are measured as a concentration in blood plasma. A primary example is haemoglobin concentration ( ( Hb)) , a marker of erythropoiesis commonly used within medicine and also used to detect blood doping. Natural changes in PV can confound ( Hb) values when a volume change is detected rather than a true change in haemoglobin mass ( Hb
