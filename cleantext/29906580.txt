  The purpose of this study was to assess the radiological and clinical outcomes following lumbar fusion intervention and to compare both , the established posterior lumbar interbody fusion ( PLIF)- technique and the dynamic hybrid instrumentation ( ` topping off '). In this prospective randomised trial all patients presented with degenerative changes to the lumbar spine ( L2-S1) were included and randomised in two groups: patients who underwent the 360 Â°- fusion procedure in PLIF-technique ( 1 , control group) and those patients who underwent fusion surgery with additional hybrid instrumentation ( DTO , Zimmer , Inc.) cranial to the rigid fixed segment ( 2 , intervention group). Patients ' demographics were documented and the follow-up visits were conducted after 6 weeks , and then stepwise after 6 up to 36 months. Each follow-up visit included assessment of quality of life and pain using specific questionnaires ( COMI , SF-36 , ODI) as well as the radiological evaluation with the focus on the adjacent level alteration. 15 patients per group met the inclusion criteria and after 36 months the lost of follow-up was 33.33 %. At the maximum follow-up time the overall risk for ASD was substantial ( i.e. 24.14 %) independent of the surgical procedure. Material failure was observed in 17.24 %. Although no significant difference was observed between both groups , all patients presented with postoperative improvement regarding the clinical scores. The present study can not support the safety of dynamic hybrid devices in those cases if the reduction of ASD is the main target , especially regarding the reported implant failure rates and the similar clinical outcomes between the both groups.
