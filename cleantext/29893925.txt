  Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular vacuolar process. Since Christian de Duve first coined the term ` autophagy ' in 1963 , it had not been well understood at the molecular level until much later , due to limitations in biochemical approaches and/or morphological approaches posed by electron microscopy. An important milestone was achieved with the isolation and identification of autophagy-related ( ATG) genes by genetic screening using yeast Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> ATG genes are well conserved in most eukaryotic organisms , which allowed the subsequent isolation of ATG gene-knockouts in plants. From the phenotypic analyses of the autophagy-defective plants , the physiological roles of autophagy have been predicted. However , in some cases , all the phenotypes can not be simply explained by defects in autophagy. Therefore , in order to fully understand the physiological implications of plant autophagy , it is quite important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in each process in macro-/ micro-autophagy. Although , until recently , our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of plant autophagy was lagging compared to similar research in yeast and animals , current studies have made many great advances in the plant research field. In this review , we discuss current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of plant autophagy , from autophagy-induction/autophagosome-formation to vacuolar degradation , comparing these to processes in yeast and mammals. We also review aspects of plant autophagy research that require further investigation in the future.
