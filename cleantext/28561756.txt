  Nicotine as a toxic substance leads to impairment of the reproductive system function. The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of melatonin on testicular alterations , sperm nuclear integrity , and epididymal sperm parameters in mice treated with nicotine. Male mice were divided into four groups. Group A received the vehicle , group B received nicotine 0.1 mg/100 g BW , group C received melatonin 10 mg/kg , group D received nicotine plus melatonin. Evaluations were made by histology and Johnson 's score for study of spermatogenesis , immunostaining for study of male germ cells apoptosis , sperm chromatin dispersion ( SCD) test for assaying sperm chromatin integrity , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) for assessment of serum levels of testosterone and luteinizing hormone ( LH) , and sperm parameters including morphology , motility , and count. Nicotine caused a significant decrease in spermatogenesis quantity and Johnson 's score , sperm parameters , and sex hormones. Melatonin in group D , increased sperm chromatin integrity , improved spermatogenesis , Johnson 's score , and sperm parameters ( this study showed administration of melatonin in nicotine-treated mice increases both quality and quantity of spermatogenesis and integrity of sperm 's chromatin through reducing apoptosis and modifying the testosterone level.
