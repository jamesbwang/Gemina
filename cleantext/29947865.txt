  Postmenopausal ( PM) women using inhaled glucocorticoids ( IGCs) had substantial abnormalities in volumetric BMD ( vBMD) , microarchitecture , and stiffness using high resolution peripheral computed tomography ( HRpQCT) compared to age- and race-matched controls. Abnormalities were most severe at the radius. These preliminary results suggest that there may be major , heretofore unrecognized , skeletal deficits in PM women using IGCs. While oral glucocorticoids are well recognized to have destructive skeletal effects , less is known about the effects of IGCs. The detrimental skeletal effects of IGCs may be greatest in PM women , in whom they compound negative effects of estrogen loss and aging. The goal of this study was to evaluate microarchitecture and stiffness in PM women using chronic IGCs. This case-control study compared PM women using IGCs for â‰¥ 6 months ( n = 20) and controls matched for age and race/ethnicity ( n = 60). Skeletal parameters assessed included areal BMD ( aBMD) by DXA , trabecular and cortical vBMD and microarchitecture by HRpQCT of the radius and tibia , and whole bone stiffness by finite element analysis. By DXA , mean values in both groups were in the osteopenic range; hip aBMD was lower in IGC users ( P < 0.04). By HRpQCT , IGC users had lower total , cortical , and trabecular vBMD at both radius and tibia ( all P < 0.05). IGC users had lower cortical thickness , lower trabecular number , greater trabecular separation and heterogeneity at the radius ( all P < 0.03) , and greater heterogeneity at the tibia ( P < 0.04). Whole bone stiffness was lower in IGC users at radius ( P < 0.03) and tended to be lower at the tibia ( P = 0.09). PM women using IGCs had substantial abnormalities in vBMD , microarchitecture , and stiffness compared to controls. These abnormalities were most severe at the radius. These preliminary results suggest that there may be major , heretofore unrecognized , skeletal deficits in PM women using IGCs.
