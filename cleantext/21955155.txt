  Molecular changes in cortical areas of addicted brain may underlie cognitive impairment and loss of control over intake of addictive substances and alcohol. Prodynorphin ( PDYN) gives rise to dynorphin ( DYNs) opioid peptides which target kappa-opioid receptor ( KOR). DYNs mediate alcohol-induced impairment of learning and memory , while KOR antagonists block excessive , compulsive-like drug and alcohol self-administration in animal models. In human brain , the DYN/KOR system may undergo adaptive changes , which along with neuronal loss , may contribute to alcohol-associated cognitive deficit. We addressed this hypothesis by comparing the expression levels and co-expression ( transcriptionally coordinated) patterns of PDYN and KOR ( OPRK1) genes in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC) between human alcoholics and controls. Postmortem brain specimens of 53 alcoholics and 55 controls were analyzed. PDYN was found to be downregulated in dlPFC of alcoholics , while OPRK1 transcription was not altered. PDYN downregulation was confined to subgroup of subjects carrying C , a high-risk allele of PDYN promoter SNP rs1997794 associated with alcoholism. Changes in PDYN expression did not depend on the decline in neuronal proportion in alcoholics , and thereby may be attributed to transcriptional adaptations in alcoholic brain. Absolute expression levels of PDYN were lower compared to those of OPRK1 , suggesting that PDYN expression is a limiting factor in the DYN/KOR signaling , and that the PDYN downregulation diminishes efficacy of DYN/KOR signaling in dlPFC of human alcoholics. The overall outcome of the DYN/KOR downregulation may be disinhibition of neurotransmission , which when overactivated could contribute to formation of alcohol-related behavior.
