  An improved and highly sensitive method was developed and validated for the determination of 12 ( seven permitted and five non-permitted in Korea) non-nutritive sweeteners in various foods using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry. The chromatographic separation was performed on an Xbridge BEH C18 column ( 3 mm × 100 mm , 2.5 μm) with gradient elution using 10 mM ammonium acetate in water and 10 mM ammonium acetate in methanol. Sample preparation consisted of simple dilution , homogenisation , centrifugation and purification with a C18 cartridge prior to analysis. The relative matrix effect ( % ME) was within ± 20 % for all sweeteners. The method also showed good linearity ( R
