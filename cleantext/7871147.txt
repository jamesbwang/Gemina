  Falls in individuals aged ≥ 60 years may result in injury , hospitalisation or death. The role of anti-hypertensive medications in falls among older adults is unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the association of six anti-hypertensive medication classes , namely α-blockers ( AB) , angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEi) , angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARB) , β-blockers ( BB) , calcium channel blockers ( CCB) and diuretics , with the risk of falls , injurious falls or recurrent falls in individuals aged ≥ 60 years compared with non-users. We performed systematic searches in PubMed , EMBASE and CINAHL and included cohort , case-control and cross-sectional studies that investigated the associations between the use of anti-hypertensive medication classes and the risk of falls , injurious falls or recurrent falls in older adults ( ≥ 60 years) reported in English. We assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale ( NOS). Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios ( ORs) were pooled using random effects model. We performed meta-analyses for each anti-hypertensive medication class and each fall outcome. We also performed sensitivity analyses by pooling studies of high quality and subgroup analyses among studies with an average age of ≥ 80 years. Seventy-eight articles ( where 74 , 34 , 27 , 18 , 13 and 11 of them examined diuretics , BB , CCB , ACEi , AB and ARB , respectively) met our inclusion and exclusion criteria; we pooled estimates from 60 articles. ACEi ( OR 0.85 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.81-0.89) , BB ( OR 0.84 , 95 % CI 0.76-0.93) and CCB ( OR 0.81 , 95 % CI 0.74-0.90) use were associated with a lower risk of injurious falls than in non-users. Results in sensitivity and subgroup analyses were largely consistent. The use of ACEi , BB or CCB among older adults may be associated with a lower risk of injurious falls than non-use.
