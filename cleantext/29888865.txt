  Essentials Glycosylation heterogeneity of recombinant proteins affects pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. N-glycomics/glycoproteomics of plasma-derived Factor VIII and 6 recombinant FVIIIs were compared. Depending on cell line , significant differences to plasma-derived FVIII were observed. Recombinant FVIIIs expressed distinct and immunologically relevant epitopes. Background/Objective Human factor VIII ( FVIII) is a plasma glycoprotein , defects of which result in hemophilia A. Current substitution therapy uses FVIII products purified from human plasma or from various cell lines ( recombinant FVIII) with different levels of B-domain deletion. Glycosylation is a post-translational protein modification in FVIII that has a substantial influence on its physical , functional and antigenic properties. Variation in glycosylation is likely to be the reason that FVIII products differ in their pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity. However , the literature on FVIII glycosylation is inconsistent , preventing assembly into a coherent model. Seeking to better understand the glycosylation mechanisms underlying FVIII biology , we studied the N-glycosylation of human plasma-derived ( pd) FVIII and six rFVIII products expressed in CHO , BHK or HEK cell lines. Methods FVIII samples were subjected to head-to-head detailed glycomic and glycoproteomic characterization using a combination of MALDI-MS and MS/MS , GC-MS and UPLC-UV-MS
