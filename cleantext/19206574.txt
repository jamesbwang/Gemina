  The combination of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and metastable helium induced electron spectroscopy is used to determine the density of states of the inner and outer coaxial carbon nanotubes. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy typically measures the density of states across the entire carbon nanotube , while metastable helium induced electron spectroscopy measures the density of states of the outermost layer alone. The use of double-walled carbon nanotubes in electronic devices allows for the outer wall to be functionalised whilst the inner wall remains defect free and the density of states is kept intact for electron transport. Separating the information of the inner and outer walls enables development of double-walled carbon nanotubes to be independent , such that the charge transport of the inner wall is maintained and confirmed whilst the outer wall is modified for functional purposes.
