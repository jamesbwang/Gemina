  The enantiopure dimethyl-ethylenedithio-tetrathiafulvalene ( DM-EDT-TTF) donor exists as biaxial ( ax , ax) and biequatorial ( eq , eq) conformers in equilibrium. DFT calculations combined with free energy surface ( FES) analysis establish that the ( ax , ax) form is more stable by ∼ 0.7 kcal · mol-1 than the ( eq , eq) one and that the inter-conversion process involves a sequential conformational change through a boat type ( ax , eq) conformer with an activation energy of ∼ 3 kcal.mol-1. TD-DFT calculations show similar , but opposite in sign , CD bands for the two conformers. A Boltzmann type average of the two CD curves , corresponding to a ratio of three ( ax , ax) for one ( eq , eq) conformers in equilibrium in solution , provides an excellent agreement with the experimental curve.
