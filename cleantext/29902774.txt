  Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to public health. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics are generally recognized as the key factors contributing to antibiotic resistance. However , whether non-antibiotic , anti-microbial ( NAAM) chemicals can directly induce antibiotic resistance is unclear. We aim to investigate whether the exposure to a NAAM chemical triclosan ( TCS) has an impact on inducing antibiotic resistance on Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> Here , we report that at a concentration of 0.2 mg/L TCS induces multi-drug resistance in wild-type Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> after 30-day TCS exposure. The oxidative stress induced by TCS caused genetic mutations in genes such as fabI , frdD , marR , acrR and soxR , and subsequent up-regulation of the transcription of genes encoding beta-lactamases and multi-drug efflux pumps , together with down-regulation of genes related to membrane permeability. The findings advance our understanding of the potential role of NAAM chemicals in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in microbes , and highlight the need for controlling biocide applications.
