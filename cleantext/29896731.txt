  To assess the application value in prenatal diagnosis using karyotype analysis combined with BACs-on-Beads ( BoBs) assay. Nine hundred sixty five pregnant women were subjected to amniocentesis , chromosomal karyotype analysis and detection of BoBs were employed simultaneously for abnormal number of chromosomes and 9 chromosome microdeletion syndrome<disease> in prenatal diagnosis. Fifty cases common chromosome aneupoidies were successfully detected by both karyotype analysis and BoBs which included 31 cases of trisomy 21,10 cases of trisomy 18 and 9 cases with sex chromosome abnormality. BoBs in addition detected 1 case of DiGeorge-1 microdeletion syndrome<disease> and 1 case of 7q11 .23 microduplication syndrome<disease>. All 9 fetuses with chromosome abnormalities detected by karyotyping were missed by BoBs , including 2 cases of marker chromosomes ,4 cases of chromosomal translocation ,1 case of chromosomal inversion , 2 cases of Sex chromosome mosaicism; 2 cases of fetal inherited from the parents ,7 cases for novel mutations. Karyotype analysis combined with BoBs dedtection is a rapid , effective and highly accurate prenatal diagnosis model that may should be widely used in clinical diagnosis.
