  3D printing , or rapid prototyping , is a fabrication technique that is used for various engineering applications with advantages such as mass production and fine tuning of spatial-dimensional properties. Recently , this fabrication method has been adopted for tissue engineering applications due to its ability to finely tune porosity and create precise , uniform , and repeatable structures. This review aims to introduce 3D printing applications in soft tissue engineering and regenerative medicine including state-of-the-art scaffolds and key future challenges. Furthermore , 3D printing of individual cells , an evolution of traditional 3D printing technology which represents a cutting-edge technique for the creation of cell seeded scaffolds
