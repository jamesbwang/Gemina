Physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> of a jaw repositioning custom-made mouthguard on airway and their effects on athletic performance. J Strength Cond Res XX ( X): 000-000 , 2018-Advanced dental techniques such as jaw-repositioning have shown to increase lower body muscular power such as vertical jump , but its effects on acceleration and speed have not been studied. Similarly , jaw repositioning is commonly used to increase airways volume and ventilation in a special population ( i.e. , obstructive sleep apnea); however , its ergogenic effects on aerobic performance have yet not been studied. The purpose of the cross-over study was to investigate the effects of a jaw-repositioning custom-made mouthguard ( JCM) on volumetric changes in airway and jaw position and determine the effects this may have on aerobic and anaerobic performance. Results indicated that jaw-repositioning custom-made mouthguard may have an ergogenic effect on performance. The JCM condition showed an increase of 13 % in upper airway volume ( p = 0.04) , 10 % in upper airway width ( p = 0.004) , 7 % in ventilation ( p = 0.006) , 5 % in maximal aerobic power ( p = 0.003) , 4 % in time to exhaustion<symptom> ( p = 0.03) , 3 % in vertical jump ( p = 0.03) , 2 % in broad jump ( p = 0.009) , and a decrease of 4 % in 20-m ( p = 0.04) and 2 % in 40-m ( p = 0.001) sprint times. This is the first study to demonstrate a significant link between jaw repositioning , airway volumetric change , and performance enhancement in both aerobic and anaerobic performances. The results of this study may lead to a change in culture for the use of mouthguards in different sports applications , from high orofacial injury risk sports to other sports , specifically for ergogenic enhancement.
