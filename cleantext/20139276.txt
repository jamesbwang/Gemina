  Insect thioester-containing protein ( iTEP) is the most recently defined group among the thioester-containing protein ( TEP) superfamily. TEPs are key components of the immune system , and iTEPs from flies and mosquitoes were shown to be major immune weapons. Initially characterized from insects , TEP genes homologous to iTEP were further described from several other invertebrates including arthropods , cniderians , and mollusks albeit with few functional characterizations.
