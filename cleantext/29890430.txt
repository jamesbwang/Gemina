  Biochar has a significant effect on alleviating acid soil aluminum ( Al) toxicity and promoting plant growth. The potential effects of aged biochar ( long-term applied biochar in soil) on soil amendment have attracted increasing attention. Here , the effects of biochar and aged biochar were evaluated through a pot experiment. The seedlings of cabbage were grown in red soil for 45 days with the following four biochar treatments: CK ( 0 % biochar) , PB ( 2 % primary biochar) , WB ( 2 % water washed biochar) and AB ( 2 % acidulated biochar) to investigate the potential effect of biochar and aged biochar on mitigating red soil aluminum toxicity and improving cabbage growth. Results indicated that biochar increased the content of available potassium , available phosphorus , and organic carbon in red soil and improved cabbage growth. Biochar not only increased the pH of red soil by 0.42 units , but also reduced exchangeable acid and exchangeable hydrogen ( H
