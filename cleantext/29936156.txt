  Autotrophic and mixotrophic denitrification , two approaches of biological denitrification , have drawn more and more attention among the techniques to remove nitrogen from the aquatic environment. This study investigated the influence of phosphorus on the denitrification performance and bacterial community structure in the autotrophic and mixotrophic denitrification reactors. The activity test was applied to evaluate the variation of denitrification activity of autotrophic and mixotrophic sludge before and after phosphorus addition. High-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the change of bacterial community structure. The results showed that NO
