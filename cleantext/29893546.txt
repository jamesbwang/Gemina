  Cognitive decline and psychosis have been hypothesized to be mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor ( NMDAR) hypofunction. Consistent with this hypothesis , chronic treatment with d-alanine , a coagonist at the glycine site of the NMDAR , leads to an improvement of positive and cognitive symptoms in schizophrenic patients. d-alanine is oxidized by d-amino acid oxidase ( DAAO); thus , an inhibitor of DAAO would be expected to enhance d-alanine levels and likewise lead to desirable clinical outcomes. Sodium benzoate , on the basis of d-amino acid inhibition , was observed to display beneficial clinical effects in schizophrenic and Alzheimer 's patients. However , in the clinical pilot studies using sodium benzoate , d-amino acids were not quantified to verify that sodium benzoate 's efficacy was mediated through DAAO inhibition. In this study , d-alanine content was monitored in cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF) of dogs treated with daily injections of d-alanine ( 30 mg/kg) alone and in combination with sodium benzoate ( 30 mg/kg) for seven consecutive days. We reasoned that the cerebral spinal fluid d-alanine quantity is reflective of the brain d-alanine levels and it would increase as a consequence of DAAO inhibition with sodium benzoate. We found that d-alanine treatment lead to maximal concentration of 7.51 Î¼M CSF d-alanine level; however , coadministration of sodium benzoate and d-alanine did not change CSF d-alanine level beyond that of d-alanine treatment alone. As a consequence , we conclude that clinical efficacy associated with chronic administration of sodium benzoate in schizophrenic and Alzheimer 's patients is likely not mediated through inhibition of DAAO.
