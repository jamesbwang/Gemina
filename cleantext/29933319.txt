  To evaluate the effect on health outcomes of an early or immediate return-to-work ( RTW) after acute<symptom> low<symptom> back pain ( LBP). A longitudinal cohort of workers ( N = 557) consulting for uncomplicated LBP were assessed on demographic , pain , occupational , and psychosocial variables. Pain and function were assessed at 3-months post pain onset. We tested the longitudinal effects of an early RTW on 3-month outcomes. Pain and function improved more rapidly for workers with an immediate ( 30.7 %) or early ( 1-7 days) RTW ( 36.8 %). Eleven demographic , health , or workplace variables were identified as potential confounds , but controlling for these factors only partially attenuated the benefits of an early RTW. An early RTW improves acute LBP and functional recovery , and alternate confounding explanations only partially eclipse this therapeutic effect.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
