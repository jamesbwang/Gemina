  This article presents an action research study that explores how a fifth-grade classroom of 10- to 11-year-old children in Cyprus perceive the concepts of grief and grieving , after an educational intervention provided space for discussing such issues. It also explores the impact that the intervention program had on children 's emotions while exploring these concepts and illustrates how it affected their behavior. The findings suggest that the intervention had a constructive impact on children 's understandings of grief and grieving along two important dimensions. First , the intervention helped children better define emotional responses to loss ( grief). Second , children seemed to overcome their anxiety<symptom> while talking about grief and grieving and were able to share relevant personal experiences. The study has important implications for curriculum development , pedagogical practice , and teacher training on death education.
