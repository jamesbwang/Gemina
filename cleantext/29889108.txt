  This is a retrospective cohort study. To report the rate , reasons , and risk factors for 90-day readmissions after lumbar discectomy at an academic medical center. Several studies have reported complications and readmissions after spine surgery; however , only one previous study has focused specifically on lumbar discectomy. As the patient profile and morbidity of various spine procedures is different , focus on procedure-specific complications and readmissions will be beneficial. Patients who underwent lumbar discectomy for unrelieved symptoms of prolapsed intervertebral disk and had at least 90 days of follow-up at an academic institution ( 2013-2014) were included. Retrospective review of electronic medical record was performed to record demographic and clinical profile of patients. Details of lumbar discectomy , index hospital stay , discharge disposition , hospital readmission within 90 days , reason for readmission and treatment given have been reported. Risk factors for hospital readmission were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 356 patients with a mean age of 45.0 Â± 13.8 years were included. The 90-day readmission rate was 5.3 % ( 19/360) of which two-third patients were admitted within 30 days giving a 30-day readmission rate of 3.7 % ( 13/356). The top 2 primary reasons for readmission included back and/or leg<symptom> pain<symptom> , numbness , or tingling ( 42.9 %) , and persistent cerebrospinal fluid leak or seroma ( 25.0 %). On adjusted analysis , risk factors associated with higher risk of readmission included incidental durotomy ( odds ratio ( OR) , 26.2; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 5.3-129.9) and discharge to skilled nursing facility/inpatient rehabilitation ( OR , 25.2; 95 % CI , 2.7-235.2). Increasing age was a negative predictor of readmission ( OR , 0.95; 95 % CI , 0.91-0.99). Incidental durotomy , younger age , and discharge to nursing facility were associated with higher risk of 90-day hospital readmission after lumbar discectomy. As compared with extensive spine procedures , patient comorbidity burden may not be as significant in predicting readmission after this relatively less invasive procedure.
