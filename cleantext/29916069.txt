  As it serves an important function in the compartmentalization of a series of components , from secondary metabolites to proteins , the vacuole is a central organelle in plant cell biology and development. One of the most important mechanisms regulating not only vacuolar biogenesis but also its luminal content , is the vacuolar sorting of proteins. This sorting mechanism is based upon the recognition of specific signal sequences , vacuolar sorting determinants , by sorting receptors , which then act by redirecting vacuolar cargo away from the default secretory pathway , and into the vacuolar lumen. One of the most direct ways of understanding if a given peptide possesses vacuolar sorting determinant capability is to isolate it , fuse it with a marker and express it in a plant system such as Nicotiana tabacum , a pipeline which will be described in more detail in this chapter.
