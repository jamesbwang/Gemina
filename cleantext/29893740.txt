  The effects of Mn ( II) on Fenton system to treat papermaking wastewater and the mechanism of Mn ( II) enhanced Fenton reaction were investigated in this study. The chemical oxygen demand ( COD) removal efficiency was enhanced in the presence of Mn ( II) , which increased by 19 % compared with that of the Fenton system alone. The pseudo-first order reaction kinetic rate constant of Mn ( II)/ Fenton system was 2.11 times higher than that of Fenton system. 67 % -81 % COD were removed with the increasing Mn ( II) concentration from 0 to 0.8 g/L. COD removal efficiency was also enhanced in a wider pH range ( 3-7) , which indicated the operation parameters of Fenton technology could be broadened to a milder condition. The study of the mechanism showed that Mn ( II) participated in the oxidation and coagulation stages in Fenton system. In the oxidation stage , Mn ( II) promotes the production of HO
