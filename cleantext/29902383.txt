  Gastric cancer ( GC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite recent advances in diagnosis and therapy , the prognosis of patients with GC is poor. Many patients have inoperable disease upon diagnosis or experience recurrent disease after curative gastrectomy. Unfortunately , tumor markers for GC , such as serum carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 , lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Therefore , effective biomarkers are required to detect early GC and to predict tumor recurrence and chemosensitivity. Areas covered: Here we aimed to review recent developments in techniques that improve the detection of aberrant expression of GC-associated molecules , including protein coding genes , microRNAs , long noncoding RNAs , and methylated promoter DNAs. Expert commentary: Detection of genetic and epigenetic alterations in gastric tissue or in the circulation will likely improve the diagnosis and management of GC to achieve significantly improved outcomes.
