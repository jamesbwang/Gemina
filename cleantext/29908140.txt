  Due to the occurrence of genetic recombination , a reliable and discriminatory method to genotype Cryptosporidium isolates at the intra-species level requires the analysis of multiple loci , but a standardised scheme is not currently available. A workshop was held at the Robert Koch Institute , Berlin in 2016 that gathered 23 scientists with appropriate expertise ( in either Cryptosporidium genotyping and/or surveillance , epidemiology or outbreaks) to discuss the processes for the development of a robust , standardised , multi-locus genotyping ( MLG) scheme and propose an approach. The background evidence and main conclusions were outlined in a previously published report; the objectives of this further report are to describe 1) the current use of Cryptosporidium genotyping , 2) the elicitation and synthesis of the participants ' opinions , and 3) the agreed processes and criteria for the development , evaluation and validation of a standardised MLG scheme for Cryptosporidium surveillance and outbreak investigations. Cryptosporidium was characterised to the species level in 7/12 ( 58 %) participating European countries , mostly for human outbreak investigations. Further genotyping was mostly by sequencing the gp60 gene. A ranking exercise of performance and convenience criteria found that portability , biological robustness , typeability , and discriminatory power were considered by participants as the most important attributes in developing a multilocus scheme. The major barrier to implementation was lack of funding. A structured process for marker identification , evaluation , validation , implementation , and maintenance was proposed and outlined for application to Cryptosporidium , with prioritisation of Cryptosporidium parvum<pathogen> to support investigation of transmission in Europe.
