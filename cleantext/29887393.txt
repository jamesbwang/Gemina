  Since its discovery as a skeletal muscle-specific transcription factor able to reprogram somatic cells into differentiated myofibers , MyoD has provided an instructive model to understand how transcription factors regulate gene expression. Reciprocally , studies of other transcriptional regulators have provided testable hypotheses to further understand how MyoD activates transcription. Using MyoD as a reference , in this review , we discuss the similarities and differences in the regulatory mechanisms employed by tissue-specific transcription factors to access DNA and regulate gene expression by cooperatively shaping the chromatin landscape within the context of cellular differentiation.
