  Amyloidosis is the extracellular deposition of amyloid protein fibrils , and this condition may be hereditary or acquired. Patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis are particularly at risk for developing acquired amyloidosis. A rare form of amyloidosis is an amyloidoma or amyloid tumor , which occurs when amyloid focally deposits in a section of the musculoskeletal system , most commonly in the osteoarticular system. Here , we present a case of a hemodialysis-related amyloidoma of the left femoral neck in an 80-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis for 8 years. The purpose of this report is to provide an account of the unique clinical , imaging , and histopathologic manifestation of a dialysis-related amyloidoma that progressively enlarges over a 2-year period. This report also highlights some prophylactic measures that may reduce the risk of developing an associated pathologic fracture.
