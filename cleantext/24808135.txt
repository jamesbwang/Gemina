  Natural product discovery is pivot for drug development , however , this endeavor is often challenged by the wide inactivation or silence of natural products biosynthetic pathways. We recently developed a highly efficient approach to activate cryptic/silenced biosynthetic pathways through augmentation of the phosphopantetheinylation of carrier proteins. By applying this approach in the
