  Despite advances in treatments for endometriosis , some symptoms persist owing to the chronic inflammation<symptom> observed in this disease. To identify resources , methods , and/or complementary treatments to alleviate the pain symptoms<symptom> of endometriosis , and to identify adverse effects of treatments. Lilacs , Scielo , PEDro , Scopus , Pubmed , CENTRAL Cochrane , Science Direct , and Google Scholar were searched for studies published in Portuguese , English , and Spanish to July 31 , 2017 , using the terms `` physical therapy '' OR `` complementary treatment '' AND `` endometriosis ''. Randomized controlled trials relating to complementary pelvic pain treatment and adverse effects. Eight studies were identified; two studies were included in the meta-analysis. The complementary interventions studied were acupuncture , exercise , electrotherapy , and yoga. All were inconclusive in affirming benefit , but demonstrated a positive trend in the treatment of symptoms of endometriosis. Meta-analysis of acupuncture showed a significant benefit in pain reduction as compared with placebo ( P = 0.007). Numerous complementary treatments have been used to alleviate the symptoms of endometriosis , but only acupuncture has demonstrated a significant improvement in outcomes. Nevertheless , other approaches demonstrated positive trends toward improving symptoms; this should encourage investigators to design controlled studies to support their applicability.
