  Programmed cell death-1 ( PD-1) inhibitor-related hematologic toxicities are a category of rare but clinically serious and potentially life-threatening adverse events; however , little is known about their risks across different treatment regimens and tumor types. The objective of this study was to compare the incidences of PD-1 inhibitor-related hematologic toxicities among different therapeutic regimens and tumor types. Twenty-six original articles on PD-1 inhibitor trials were identified based on a PubMed search completed on September 26 , 2017. The incidences of hematologic toxicities were collected. A total of 26 studies containing 5,088 patients were included in the meta-analysis. PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy was associated with an increased risk of all-grade anemia<symptom> in cancer patients ( 5 % , 95 % CI 4 % -6 %) , particularly in patients with renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) ( 8 % , 95 % CI 6 % -12 %) , compared with all-grade thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( 2 % , 95 % CI 1 % -5 %) , leukopenia<symptom> ( 2 % , 95 % CI 1 % -3 %) , and neutropenia ( 1 % , 95 % CI 0-1 %). However , low incidences of high-grade hematologic toxicities were observed in cancer patients treated with PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy. The use of PD-1 inhibitors in combination with ipilimumab , peptide vaccines , or chemotherapy had significantly higher risks than PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy for all-grade anemia<symptom> ( 13 % , 95 % CI 5 % -31 %) , thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( 6 % , 95 % CI 2 % -18 %) , leukopenia<symptom> ( 5 % , 95 % CI 1 % -35 %) , neutropenia ( 4 % , 95 % CI 1 % -26 %) , and only high-grade thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( 4 % , 95 % CI 1 % -15 %). In addition , all-grade and high-grade hematologic toxicities in chemotherapy and everolimus treatment arms were more frequent than in PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy arms. The risks of PD-1 inhibitor-related hematologic toxicities were higher in RCC than in other cancers , and during combination therapy. These results may contribute toward enhancing awareness among clinicians about frequent clinical monitoring when managing PD-1 inhibitors.
