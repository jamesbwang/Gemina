  Biofilms are dynamic consortia of microorganism that play a key role in freshwater ecosystems. By changing their community structure , biofilms respond quickly to environmental changes and can be thus used as indicators of water quality. Currently , biofilm assessment is mostly based on integrative and functional endpoints , such as photosynthetic or respiratory activity , which do not provide information on the biofilm community structure. Flow cytometry and computational visualization offer an alternative , sensitive , and easy-to-use method for assessment of the community composition , particularly of the photoautotrophic part of freshwater biofilms. It requires only basic sample preparation , after which the entire sample is run through the flow cytometer. The single-cell optical and fluorescent information is used for computational visualization and biological interpretation. Its main advantages over other methods are the speed of analysis and the high-information-content nature. Flow cytometry provides information on several cellular and biofilm traits in a single measurement: particle size , density , pigment content , abiotic content in the biofilm , and coarse taxonomic information. However , it does not provide information on biofilm composition on the species level. We see high potential in the use of the method for environmental monitoring of aquatic ecosystems and as an initial biofilm evaluation step that informs downstream detailed investigations by complementary and more detailed methods.
