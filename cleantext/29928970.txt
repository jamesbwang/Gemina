  Radiotherapy is the most widely used treatment method for treating cancer with or without surgery and chemotherapy. In lung cancer , it is one of the important treatment steps in excising the tumor from the lung tissue; unfortunately , radiation can induce epithelial- mesenchymal transition ( EMT) , a typical physiological process in which cuboidal shaped epithelial cell loses its phenotype and acquires mesenchymal-like phenotype thus , increases the metastasis progression in the body. To prevent EMT mediated metastasis , we aimed to 1) synthesize silver nanoparticles by using Gallic acid , a potential antioxidant which acts as stabilizing and reducing agent in the form of silver nanoparticle ( GA-AgNPs) 2) to analyze its effect on EMT markers during radiation-induced EMT in A549 cells. A549 cells were irradiated with 8Gy ( X-ray) and treated with GA-AgNPs at a fixed concentration under in vitro condition. GA-AgNPs were prepared and characterized for absorption , potential stability , size and morphology by UV-Visible spectrophotometer , Zeta potential and Transmission electron microscopy respectively. After irradiation , the morphology changes were observed using an inverted microscope , the gene and protein expression of EMT markers were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blotting. GA-AgNPs are in nano size with fair stability. The synthesized nanoparticles suppressed the EMT markers including Vimentin , N-cadherin , Snail-1 and increased E-cadherin expression which might inhibit cancer cells to acquire radio resistant metastasis potential.
