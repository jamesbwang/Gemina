  We experimentally studied the pressure dependence of the zero-field splitting ( ZFS) parameter of hemin ( iron ( III) protoporphyrin IX chloride) , which is a model complex of hemoproteins , via high-frequency and high-field electron paramagnetic resonance ( HFEPR) under pressure. Owing to the large ZFS , the pressure effect on the electronic structure of iron-porphyrin complexes has not yet been explored using EPR. Therefore , we systematically studied this effect using our newly developed sub-terahertz EPR spectroscopy system in the frequency range of 80-515 GHz , under magnetic fields up to 10 T and pressure up to 2 GPa. We observed a systematic shift of the resonance fields of hemin upon pressure application , from which the axial component of the ZFS parameter was found to increase from D = 6.9 to 7.9 cm
