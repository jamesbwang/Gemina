  The craniovertebral junction ( CVJ) is the bony transition between the cranium and cervical spine. It is a biomechanically complex articulation comprising the occipital condyles ( Oc) the atlas ( C1) and axis ( C2). Pathologies affecting the CVJ in children are myriad with clinical features resulting from biomechanical instability , deformity , or neuraxial compression. Establishing the natural history and clinical burden of a condition is challenging in infants and young children , often complicated by co-existing neuromuscular and cognitive impairment. This makes investigation and treatment planning difficult. Each disease entity has a predilection for a particular biomechanical abnormality. Investigation using dynamic imaging is most appropriate in instability , computed tomography examination in abnormalities of deformity and magnetic resonance imaging examination in neuraxial compression. Treatment comprises reduction and immobilisation of instability , re-alignment of deformity , or decompression of the neuraxis. We present a review of disease entities affecting the CVJ in children categorised according to a simple mechanistic approach to aid investigation and treatment planning.
