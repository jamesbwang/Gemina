  The purpose of this retrospective observational study is to investigate the long-term changes in cerebrovascular reactivity ( CVR) as a measure of cerebral hemodynamics in patients with intracranial steno-occlusive disease ( IC-SOD) after they have undergone an Extracranial-intracranial ( EC-IC) bypass. Twenty-six patients suffering from IC-SOD were selected from our CVR database. Nineteen patients underwent unilateral and 7 underwent bilateral revascularization. CVR measurements were done using BOLD-MRI and precisely controlled CO2 and expressed as ΔBOLD ( %)/ Δ P
