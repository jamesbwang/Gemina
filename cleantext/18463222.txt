  Gliotoxin ( GT) is a fungal secondary metabolite that has attracted great interest due to its high biological activity since it was discovered by the 1930s. An inactive derivative of this molecule , bis ( methylthio) gliotoxin ( bmGT) , has been proposed as an invasive aspergillosis ( IA) biomarker. Nevertheless , studies regarding bmGT production among common opportunistic fungi<pathogen> , including the
