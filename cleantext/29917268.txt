  Aberrant activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway has frequently been associated with various cancers , especially lung cancer. However , the key regulators of this pathway are largely unknown. Using functional proteomics screening , we found that KAP1 interacts with c-Raf. Knocking out KAP1 decreased c-Raf phosphorylation at serine 259 and increased its phosphorylation at serine 338 , which activated MEK and ERK. We detected higher KAP1 expression in lung cancer tissues than in normal peri-tumoral tissues. KAP1 knockdown arrested A549 lung cancer cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and attenuated cell growth , metastasis , the epithelial-mesenchymal transition , angiogenesis , stemness , and colony formation. Furthermore , knocking out KAP1 remarkably increased the susceptibility of A549 cells to the anti-cancer drug 5-Fluorouracil , which correlated with increasing ERK phosphorylation. In vivo xenograft experiments suggested that KAP1 deficiency significantly decreases the tumorigenicity of A549 cells. Taken together , our findings indicate that KAP1 acts as a key module in the c-Raf-interactome complex and regulates lung cancer development through the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Therefore , KAP1 may represent a potential diagnosis biomarker and new treatment target for lung cancer.
