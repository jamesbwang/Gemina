  Smoking is a risk factor for carcinogenesis and progression of urothelial cancer ( UC). Green<symptom> tea polyphenol inhibits these malignant behaviors and suppresses human antigen R ( HuR) expression , which is associated with malignant aggressiveness. This study aimed to clarify the anti-cancer effects of green tea based on the smoking status of UC patients. Three hundred and sixty ( 260 with bladder cancer , BC and 100 with upper tract UC) patients were divided into three groups based on consumption of green tea: low ( < 1 cup/day , n = 119) , middle ( 1-4 cup/day , n = 160) , and high ( > 5 cup/day , n = 81). HuR immunoreactivity was evaluated immunohistochemically in formalin-fixed specimens. In never smokers , multivariate analysis showed that the frequency of green tea consumption was a significant predictor ( middle: hazard ratio , HR , 0.36 , p = 0.002; high: HR , 0.20 , p = 0.003) of urinary tract recurrence. A high consumption of green tea was associated with low rates of urinary tract recurrence and up-grading in UC patients. In BC , high consumption was associated with a lower risk of up-grading ( p = 0.011) and up-staging ( p = 0.041) in recurrent cancer. HuR expression in the high-consumption group was lower ( p = 0.019) than that in other groups. These significant findings were not detected in ever smokers. High consumption of green tea suppressed urinary tract recurrence and the risks of up-grading and up-staging by recurrence in never smokers. Our results suggested that HuR expression played important roles in such mechanisms.
