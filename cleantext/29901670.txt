  The constant drive to replace rare-earth metal magnets has initiated great interest in an alternative. Manganese ( Mn) has emerged to be a potential candidate as a key element in rare-earth-free magnets. Its five unpaired valence electrons give it a large magnetocrystalline energy and the ability to form several intermetallic compounds. These factors have led Mn-based magnets to be a potential replacement for rare-earth permanent magnets for several applications , such as efficient power electronics , energy generators , magnetic recording and tunneling applications , and spintronics. For past few decades , Mn-based magnets have been explored in many different forms , such as bulk magnets , thin films , and nanoparticles. Here , we review the recent progress in the synthesis and structure-magnetic property relationships of Mn-based rare-earth-free magnets ( MnBi , MnAl and MnGa). Furthermore , we discuss their potential to replace rare-earth magnetic materials through the control of their structure and composition to achieve the theoretically predicted magnetic properties.
