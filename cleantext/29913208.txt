  Doxorubicin ( DOX) and Mitoxantrone ( MTX) are very effective drugs for a range of tumors despite being highly cardiotoxic. DNA topoisomerase 2 beta ( Top2ÃŸ) was revealed as key mediator of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity , although ROS generation is also an important mechanism. Oxidative stress is also an important issue in MTX-induced cardiotoxicity that is manifested by mitochondrial dysfunction. Studies have demonstrated the relationship between PARP-1 overactivation and cell viability in DOX-treated cardiomyocytes. In reference of MTX , data regarding PARP-1 overactivation as the mechanism responsible for cardiotoxicity is difficult to find. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of PARP-1 inhibitor DPQ on DOX- and MTX-mediated cardiotoxicity. Cells were exposed for 24 h to DOX or MTX in the presence or absence of DPQ. Viability , apoptosis , and genotoxicity assays were carried out. Immunofluorescence of phosphorylated histone H2AX was analyzed in H9c2 cells and cardiomyocytes from neonatal rats. Results demonstrated that DPQ co-treatment increases DOX-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells. DPQ also prevents DOX and MTX-ROS generation in part by increasing SOD and CAT activities. Furthermore , DPQ co-treatment increased the generation of DNA strand breaks by DOX and MTX whilst also inducing phosphorylation of H2AX , MRE11 , and ATM in H9c2 cells. Our results demonstrated that as well as increasing DNA damage and inducing apoptotic cell death , DPQ enhances DOX- and MTX-mediated cytotoxicity in H9c2.
