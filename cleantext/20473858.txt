  Doxorubicin ( DOX) is an antitumor drug , associated with cardiomyopathy. Strategies to address DOX-cardiomyopathy are scarce. Here , we identify the effect of forskolin ( FSK) on DOX-induced-asymmetric-dimethylarginine ( ADMA) accumulation in monocytoid cells. DOX-challenge led to i) augmented cytotoxicity , reactive-oxygen-species ( ROS) production and methyltransferase-enzyme-activity identified as ADMA and s-adenosylhomocysteine ( SAH) accumulation ( SAH-A). However , except cytotoxicity , other DOX effects were decreased by metformin and FSK. FSK , did not alter the DOX-induced cytotoxic effect , but , decreased SAH-A by > 50 % and a combination of three drugs restored physiological methyltransferase-enzyme-activity. Together , protective effect of FSK against DOX-induced SAH-A is associated with mitigated methyltransferase-activity , a one-of-a-kind report.
