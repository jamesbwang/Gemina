  To evaluate the associations between polymorphisms in two genes , catechol-O-methyltransferase and T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 A , and acupuncture-mediated pain reduction among breast cancer survivors with aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgia. Biospecimens were obtained from 38 patients enrolled in a clinical trial of acupuncture for aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgia in postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer survivors. We used polymerase chain reaction to genotype the rs4680 ( Val158Met) and rs4633 ( His62His) variants in the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene and rs2369049 ( A > G) and rs7158782 ( A > G) variants in the T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 A gene. Response to acupuncture was defined by 30 % reduction in end-of-treatment average pain , measured by the Brief Pain Inventory. We used Fisher exact tests to evaluate associations between genotype and treatment response. Among participants , all six ( 15.8 %) subjects who expressed AA in locus rs4680 responded to acupuncture. In a combined analysis , the 18 ( 47.4 %) subjects with the responder genotype at either rs4680 ( AA) or rs2369049 ( GG or AG) were significantly more likely to respond to acupuncture than those without ( 77.8 % vs 45.0 % , P = 0.039). Specific genetic variations at loci rs4680 and rs2369049 are associated with response to acupuncture-type intervention for management of arthralgia. These results serve as a proof of concept for applying a precision medicine framework to the study of cancer pain management.
