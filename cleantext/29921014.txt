  Despite extensive efforts to mimic the fascinating adhesion capability of geckos , the development of reversible adhesives underwater has long been lagging. The appearance of mussels-inspired dopamine chemistry has provided the feasibility to fabricate underwater adhesives; however , for such a system , imitating the reversible and fast dynamic attachment/detachment mechanism of gecko feet still remains unsolved. Here , by synthesizing a thermoresponsive copolymer of poly ( dopamine methacrylamide-co-methoxyethyl-acrylate-co-N-isopropyl acrylamide) and then decorating it onto mushroom-shaped poly ( dimethylsiloxane) pillar arrays , a novel underwater thermoresponsive gecko-like adhesive ( TRGA) can be fabricated , yielding high adhesion during the attachment state above the lower critical solution temperature ( LCST) of the copolymer , yet low adhesion during the detachment state below the LCST of the copolymer. By integrating the Fe
