  Wearables as medical technologies are becoming an integral part of personal analytics , measuring physical status , recording physiological parameters , or informing schedule for medication. These continuously evolving technology platforms do not only promise to help people pursue a healthier life style , but also provide continuous medical data for actively tracking metabolic status , diagnosis , and treatment. Advances in the miniaturization of flexible electronics , electrochemical biosensors , microfluidics , and artificial intelligence algorithms have led to wearable devices that can generate real-time medical data within the Internet of things. These flexible devices can be configured to make conformal contact with epidermal , ocular , intracochlear , and dental interfaces to collect biochemical or electrophysiological signals. This article discusses consumer trends in wearable electronics , commercial and emerging devices , and fabrication methods. It also reviews real-time monitoring of vital signs using biosensors , stimuli-responsive materials for drug delivery , and closed-loop theranostic systems. It covers future challenges in augmented , virtual , and mixed reality , communication modes , energy management , displays , conformity , and data safety. The development of patient-oriented wearable technologies and their incorporation in randomized clinical trials will facilitate the design of safe and effective approaches.
