  Properly designed monolayer-protected nanoparticles ( 2 nm core diameter) can be used as nanoreceptors for selective detection and identification of phenethylamine derivatives ( designer drugs) in water. The molecular recognition mechanism is driven by the combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions within the coating monolayer. Each nanoparticle can bind up to 30-40 analyte molecules. The affinity constants range from 10
