  For quality analysis , we applied the Six Sigma concept to define quality indicators and their boundaries as well as to compare treatment-dependent outcome data of deep brain stimulation ( DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus ( STN) in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD). The Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS) III with on medication and on stimulation , the reduction of daily levodopa equivalence doses ( LED) , and the stimulation amplitude 1 year after surgery were registered. Regarding the results of the EARLYSTIM study , sigma values for applicable studies were calculated and compared. Further , the impact of perioperative conditions on patients ' outcomes was analyzed. Forty-one studies with 2184 patients were included. The bleeding risk was 1.36 %. In median , UPDRS III on/on improved by 19.9 % while the LED was reduced by 45.2 %. The median stimulation amplitude was 2.84 V. With the Six Sigma principle , a comparison between different centers was possible. Microelectrode recordings ( MER) did not correlate with occurrence of bleedings<symptom> and did not impact patient outcome. The Six Sigma principle can be simply used to analyze , improve and compare complex medical processes , particularly , the DBS surgery. Based on these data , higher sigma values were reached for clinical improvement in UPDRS III on/on for patients who underwent surgery in local anesthesia with intraoperative test stimulation compared to surgery in general anesthesia. However , the difference was not statistically significant. Application of MER was found to be optional with no increased bleeding risk and no improvement on patient 's outcome.
