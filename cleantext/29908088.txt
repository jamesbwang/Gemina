  The aims of this randomized clinical trial were to investigate the influence of the suturing technique and the thickness of the pre- and postoperative palatal and flap mucosa on the early healing of the palate after harvesting a connective tissue graft. Furthermore , patient pain perception was evaluated. A subepithelial connective tissue graft was obtained from the palate with a single horizontal incision technique. Patients were randomly assigned to continuous interlocking suture group or criss-cross suture group. The thickness of the palatal mucosa and residual palatal flap was measured; however , these variables were not randomized. One week postoperatively , the donor site wound<disease> healing was recorded by the modified rate of early healing index ( EHI). Patient 's pain perception was assessed by a visual analogue scale. Thirty-six patients were evaluated. No statistically significant differences were found between suturing technique and wound<disease> healing ( p = 0.215). Statistically significant differences were found between postoperative flap thickness and EHI at 1 , 3 and 6 mm from the incision line ( p < 0.001). Negative correlations reaching statistical significance were found between the number of days of discomfort and residual flap thickness measured at 1 , 3 and 6 mm. No association between the suture technique and the EHI was observed. Moreover , postoperative palatal flap thickness was associated with early wound<disease> healing of the donor site. Finally , the greater the postoperative palatal flap thickness , the less intensity of the pain perceived by patients.
