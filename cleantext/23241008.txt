  Vegetation restoration as an effective sand fixation measure has made great achievements in China. However , soil water conditions deteriorate with the development and maturity of sand-fixing vegetation. In this study , we investigated the relationship between soil water content ( SWC) and vegetation coverage ( VC) at different portion ( top , middle and bottom) on ten sand dunes during the growing season ( April to October) in Horqin Sandy Land , northern China. We analyzed the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of SWC under different VC. The results indicate that VC and soil water storage were negatively correlated. The effect of vegetation on soil water storage on the sand dunes was greater in the dry season than the wet season. The VC and coefficient of coefficient of SWC were positively correlated at the 20 to 140 cm soil depth. As VC increased , the effect of drought stress increased at the 20 to 200 cm soil depths. The VC and SWC were negatively correlated at all the three portions of the sand dunes. According to soil water conditions and the concept of wilting humidity at different VC , we found that the suitable VC values were less than 0.46 , 0.52 , and 0.71 at the top , middle and bottom of the sand dunes , respectively.
