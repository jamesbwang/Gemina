  The silkworm Bombyx mori is an important lepidopteran model insect in which many kinds of natural mutants have been identified. However , molecular mechanisms of most of these mutants remain to be explored. Here we report the identification of a gene Bm-app is responsible for the silkworm minute wing ( mw) mutation which exhibits highly small wings during pupal and adult stages. Comparing with the wild type silkworm , relative mRNA expression of Bm-app is significantly decreased in the u11 mutant strain which shows mw phenotype. A 10-bp insertion in the putative promoter region of the Bm-app gene in mw mutant strain was identified and the dual luciferase assay revealed that this insertion decreased Bm-app promoter activity. Furthermore , CRISPR/Cas9-meidated depletion of the Bm-app induced similar wing defects appeared in mw mutant , demonstrating that Bm-app controls wing development in B. mori. Bm-app encodes a palmitoyltransferase and is responsible for the palmitoylation of selected cytoplasmic proteins , indicating that it is required for cell mitosis and growth during wing development. We also discuss the possibility that Bm-app regulates wing development by through the Hippo signaling pathway in B. mori. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
