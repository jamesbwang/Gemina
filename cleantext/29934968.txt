  Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) , as one of early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders , is characterized by the following symptoms , including repetitive and stereotyped behaviors , impairments in social interaction , and dysfunctions in communication. ASD afflicts ∼ 1.5 % of children aged 8 years in America and ∼ 4.5 ‰ of children aged 0-6 years in China. Existing studies suggest that SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein 2 ( SHANK2) is implicated in ASD. However , associations between SNPs in SHANK2 introns and ASD risk have been less investigated. In this study , on the basis of case-control study ( 226 cases and 239 controls) , we selected nine SNPs ( rs76717360 , rs11236697 , rs74336682 , rs77950809 , rs17428526 , rs35459123 , rs75357229 , rs61887413 , and rs77716438) in SHANK2 introns to investigate genetic associations between SHANK2 polymorphisms and susceptibility to ASD using improved multiple ligase detection reaction ( iMLDR). We identified that the polymorphism of rs76717360 was associated with risk of ASD in Chinese population; the haplotype of rs11236697 C ( T) or rs74336682 G ( A) increased ASD risk; and haplotypes with ≥ five SNPs containing rs11236697 and rs74336682 were associated with risk of ASD. Our results indicate SHANK2 is a susceptibility gene for ASD in Chinese children. © 2018 IUBMB Life , 2018.
