  This study aimed at finding the long non-coding RNA ( lncRNA) , miRNA and mRNA which played critical roles in breast cancer ( BrCa) by using mixOmics R package. The BrCa dataset were obtained from TCGA and then analyzed using `` DESeq2 '' R package. Multivariate analyses were performed with the `` mixOmics '' R package and the first component of the stacked partial least-Squares discriminant analysis results were used for searching the interested lncRNA , miRNA and mRNA. qRT-PCR was applied to identify the bioinformatics results in four BrCa cell lines ( MCF7 , BT-20 , ZR-75-1 , and MX-1) and the breast epithelial cell line MCF-10 A. Then cells ( MCF-1 and MX-1) were transfected with si-linc01561 , miR-145-5p mimics and si-MMP11 to further investigate the effects of linc01561 , miR-145-5p and MMP11 on the BrCa cells proliferation and apoptosis. MixOmics results showed that linc01561 , miR-145-5p and MMP11 might play important roles in BrCa. qRT-PCR results identified that in BrCa cell lines , linc01561 and MMP11 were higher expressed while miR-145-5p was lower expressed compared with those in epithelial cell line. The linc01561 inhibition elevated miR-145-5p expression and then suppressed MMP11 expression. Moreover , linc01561 inhibition suppressed the BrCa cells proliferation and promoted the apoptosis , which was realized by up-regulating expression of miR-145-5p and down-regulating expression of MMP11. In summary , the findings of this study , based on ceRNA theory , combining the research foundation of miR-145-5p and MMP11 , and taking linc01561 as a new study point , provide new insight into molecular-level reversing proliferation and apoptosis of BrCa.
