  Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( EGPA) is a disease characterized by allergic granulomatosis , necrotizing vasculitis , and peripheral blood eosinophilia. Interleukin ( IL) -33 , thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP) , and type 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2) are involved in the innate and type 2 immune responses in EGPA. However , the relationships among these molecules and the mechanisms underlying the development of EGPA remain unknown. We investigated the relationships among peripheral blood eosinophil count , serum IL-33 and TSLP concentration , and peripheral blood ILC2 count in patients with EGPA , chronic eosinophilic pneumonia<disease> ( CEP) , or bronchial asthma ( BA). We recruited 86 patients with EGPA in three groups ( remission , relapse , and onset) , 25 patients with CEP at active or inactive stages of disease , and 11 patients with BA. In patients with EGPA , CEP , or BA , serum IL-33 , sST2 , and TSLP concentrations were determined using ELISA and peripheral blood ILC2 counts ( as Lin-1 Peripheral blood eosinophil count or ILC2 count , and serum sST2 or TSLP concentration were higher in patients with EGPA at onset than in those with EGPA at relapse or remission , or in those with BA or CEP. Serum IL-33 concentration was higher in patients with EGPA at relapse than in those with EGPA at onset or remission , or in those with BA or CEP. In a logistic regression model , EGPA disease activity was correlated with serum IL-33 concentration and peripheral blood ILC2 count , but not daily systemic and inhaled corticosteroid dose or immunosuppressant use. Eosinophil count was correlated with peripheral blood ILC2 count and serum TSLP concentration , but not serum IL-33 concentration. Increased peripheral blood ILC2 count and serum IL-33 concentration were associated with disease activity in EGPA. Increases in serum IL-33 concentration may indicate the presence of active vasculitis rather than peripheral or tissue eosinophilia.
