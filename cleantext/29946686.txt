  The purpose of this study was to examine contralateral inhibition of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions ( TEOAEs) in young adults with normal hearing as a function of ear and sex. Young female ( n = 50) and male ( n = 50) adults with normal hearing participated. TEOAEs were measured bilaterally with 80 dB peSPL nonlinear clicks and 60 dB peSPL linear clicks with and without a contralateral broadband noise elicitor at 65 dB SPL. Absolute TEOAE inhibition and normalized TEOAE inhibition ( i.e. , percentage of inhibition) were examined. With both 80 and 60 dB peSPL evoking stimuli , there were significant main effects of ear and sex ( p < .05). TEOAE levels were larger in women and in the right ear. There were no statistically significant main effects of ear and sex on absolute TEOAE inhibition ( p > .05). Significant main effects of ear and sex were , however , found with normalized TEOAE inhibition ( p < .05; greater in men and in the left ear). Statistically significant negative correlations and significant linear predictive relations were found between TEOAE levels and normalized TEOAE inhibitions in both ears<disease> ( p < .001). There is no evidence of the same with absolute inhibition of TEOAEs ( p > .05). If one considers that efferent inhibition of TEOAEs is an absolute quantity , the significant effect of ear and sex on normalized inhibition and the negative association and linear predictive relationship between TEOAE level and inhibition can be viewed as spurious effects. As such , contralateral inhibition of TEOAEs does not suggest sex or ear laterality effects.
