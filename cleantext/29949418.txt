  The objective of this study was to identify features that impact the diagnostic performance of intermediate-delay washout CT for distinguishing malignant from benign adrenal lesions<symptom>. This retrospective study evaluated 127 pathologically proven adrenal lesions<symptom> ( 82 malignant , 45 benign) in 126 patients who had undergone portal venous phase and intermediate-delay washout CT ( 1-3 minutes after portal venous phase) with or without unenhanced images. Unenhanced images were available for 103 lesions<symptom>. Quantitatively , lesion<symptom> CT attenuation on unenhanced ( UA) and delayed ( DL) images , absolute and relative percentage of enhancement washout ( APEW and RPEW , respectively) , descriptive CT features ( lesion<symptom> size , margin characteristics , heterogeneity or homogeneity , fat , calcification) , patient demographics , and medical history were evaluated for association with lesion<symptom> status using multiple logistic regression with stepwise model selection. Area under the ROC curve ( A A When appropriately combined with other CT features , washout derived from intermediate-delay CT with or without additional clinical data has potential utility in differentiating malignant from benign adrenal
