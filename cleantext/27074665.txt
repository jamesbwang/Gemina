  Integration and down-regulation of cell growth and differentiation signals rely on plasma membrane receptor endocytosis and sorting towards either recycling vesicles or degradative lysosomes via multivesicular bodies ( MVB). In this process , the endosomal sorting complex-III required for transport ( ESCRT-III) controls membrane deformation and scission triggering intraluminal vesicle ( ILV) formation at early endosomes. Here , we show that the ESCRT-III member CHMP1B can be ubiquitinated within a flexible loop known to undergo conformational changes during polymerization. We demonstrate further that CHMP1B is deubiquitinated by the ubiquitin specific protease USP8 ( syn. UBPY) and found fully devoid of ubiquitin in a ~ 500 kDa large complex that also contains its ESCRT-III partner IST1. Moreover , EGF stimulation induces the rapid and transient accumulation of ubiquitinated forms of CHMP1B on cell membranes<symptom>. Accordingly , CHMP1B ubiquitination is necessary for CHMP1B function in both EGF receptor trafficking in human cells and wing development in Drosophila. Based on these observations , we propose that CHMP1B is dynamically regulated by ubiquitination in response to EGF and that USP8 triggers CHMP1B deubiquitination possibly favoring its subsequent assembly into a membrane-associated ESCRT-III polymer.
