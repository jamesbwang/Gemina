  In recent years , several laboratory studies have indicated that healthy older adults exhibit a reduction in mind-wandering frequency compared with young adults. However , it is unclear if these findings extend to daily life settings. In the current study , using experience sampling over the course of a week in the daily life of 31 young and 20 older adults , we assessed age-related differences in: ( a) mind-wandering frequency , ( b) the relationship between affect and mind-wandering frequency , and ( c) content of mind wandering. Older adults mind wandered less than young adults in daily life. Across age groups , negative affect was positively associated with mind-wandering occurrence. Finally , older adults reported that their thoughts were more pleasant , interesting , and clear compared with young adults , who had thoughts that were more dreamlike , novel , strange , and racing. Our results provide the first demonstration using thought sampling that older adults exhibit a reduction in mind-wandering frequency in daily life. Implications for current theories of age-related reductions in mind-wandering frequency are discussed. ( PsycINFO Database Record
