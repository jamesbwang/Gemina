  Three-component reactions can directly convert three reactants into the products in one pot and thus greatly shorten the synthetic path. Recently , this strategy associated with transition metal catalysis has been applied in the difunctionalization of alkenes and a remarkable progress has been achieved , facilitating the construction of a wide range of functional molecules with high atom- and step-economic efficiency. This focus review highlights the recent advances in this field.
