  Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ( FLT3) is among the most frequently mutated protein in acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) , which has been confirmed as an important drug target for AML chemotherapy. Starting from the lead compound LT-106-175 , a series of 1-H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide derivatives were synthesized to improve the FLT3 inhibitory potency and selectivity. Among them , compound 50 was identified as a highly potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor ( IC
