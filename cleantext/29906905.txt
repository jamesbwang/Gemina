  We consider a cellular monolayer , described using a vertex-based model , for which cells form a spatially disordered array of convex polygons that tile the plane. Equilibrium cell configurations are assumed to minimize a global energy defined in terms of cell areas and perimeters; energy is dissipated via dynamic area and length changes , as well as cell neighbor exchanges. The model captures our observations of an epithelium from a Xenopus embryo showing that uniaxial stretching induces spatial ordering , with cells under net tension ( compression) tending to align with ( against) the direction of stretch , but with the stress remaining heterogeneous at the single-cell level. We use the vertex model to derive the linearized relation between tissue-level stress , strain , and strain rate about a deformed base state , which can be used to characterize the tissue 's anisotropic mechanical properties; expressions for viscoelastic tissue moduli are given as direct sums over cells. When the base state is isotropic , the model predicts that tissue properties can be tuned to a regime with high elastic shear resistance but low resistance to area changes , or vice versa.
