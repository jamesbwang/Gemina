  Growth factor receptor-bound protein-associated binding protein 2 gene ( We evaluated the connection between four single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) of rs1385600 and rs1007837 were significantly associated with all the three biomarkers in CSF ( rs1385600: Aβ Pc = 0.0112 , T-tau Pc = 0.0356 , P-tau Pc = 0.0116; rs1007837: Aβ Pc = 0.0058 , T-tau Pc = 0.0278 , P-tau Pc = 0.0231). rs2373115 only showed significant association with Aβ and P-tau ( Aβ , Pc = 0.0398 , P-tau , Pc = 0.0329). rs10793294 showed no significant association with all the three biomarkers. Our study suggested that
