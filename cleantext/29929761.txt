  The number of enucleations and visual sequels due to retinoblastoma is high. The aim of this study was to evaluate the different diagnostic aspects and propose strategies that might improve the clinical management of this condition. A retrospective study was conducted on 38 patients with retinoblastoma studied genetically ( 29 unilateral , 9 bilateral). The evaluation included: age of onset , clinical signs , and time since onset , number of enucleations , time to diagnosis , and survival at 5 years. Leukocoria was the main clinical sign ( present in 90 % of cases). The mean diagnostic delay was 3.2 months. Among the unilateral cases , the eyes were enucleated in 76 % , and 55 % in the bilateral forms. Only one death was found among the 25 patients followed-up for at least 5 years. Retinoblastoma diagnostic and treatment strategies need to be updated. Good coordination between paediatricians and ophthalmologists is essential for this. Its management in reference centres , which have the necessary technology and experience , should contribute to increase the rate of organ preservation.
