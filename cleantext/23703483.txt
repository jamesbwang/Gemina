  Stroke often affects arm functions and thus impairs patients ' daily activities. Recently , several studies have shown that additional movement acoustics can enhance motor perception and motor control. Therefore , a new method has been developed that allows providing auditory feedback about arm movement trajectories in real-time for motor rehabilitation after stroke. The present article describes the study protocol for a randomized , controlled , examiner , and patient blinded superiority trial ( German Clinical Trials Register , www.drks.de , DRKS00011419) , in which the method will be applied to 13 subacute stroke patients with hemiparesis<symptom> during 12 sessions of 30 min each as additional feedback during the regular movement therapy. As primary outcome , a significant pre-post-change in the Box and Block Test is expected that exceeds the performance increase of 13 patients who will be provided with sham-acoustics. Possible limitations of the method as well as the study design are discussed.
