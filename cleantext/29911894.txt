  The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons ( TPNW) , adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in July 2017 , has been met with mixed reactions. While supporters have described the Treaty as a watershed in the struggle for disarmament , others have expressed fervent opposition. One of the most serious charges levelled at the TPNW is that it will undermine the long-standing nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT) , by many regarded as a cornerstone of the international security architecture. Critics have contended that the new agreement risks eroding the system of safeguards designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons , derailing disarmament efforts within the NPT framework , and aggravating political division between nuclear and non-nuclear powers. Investigating the legal and political cogency of these arguments , we argue that not only may the TPNW be reconciled with existing legal instruments , the new Treaty supports and reinforces key norms and institutions on which the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime is based. Furthermore , any technical challenges that might arise in the future may be addressed at meetings of states party; the drafters envisioned a dynamic process of institutional adaptations and expansion. The main challenge facing advocates of the Treaty is political: convincing the nuclear-armed states to disarm.
