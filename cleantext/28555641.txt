  Ruminating animals , especially cattle lack the carbohydrate active enzyme encoding genes which are required for the degradation of the glycosidic linkages of plant cell wall carbohydrates ( such as cellulose , hemicellulose , lignin and pectin). Thus , ruminating animals are completely dependent on the microorganisms ( anaerobic bacteria and fungi<pathogen> , methanogenic archaea and protozoa) residing in their rumen ( hindgut). In this study , we have retrieved and analyzed the complete genome wide annotations of the
