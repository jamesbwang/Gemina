  Several abbreviated versions of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT) have been developed for use in high-volume clinical situations such as emergency departments. In this study , we developed a new abbreviated version of AUDIT called the Screening Tool for At-risk Drinking ( STAD) for young and middle-aged adults , consisting of two questions that reflect the structure of the AUDIT questionnaire using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( KNHANES). To derive the abbreviated test considering AUDIT item structure , we performed confirmatory factor analysis on the 10 AUDIT questions in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( KNHANES) IV. To validate the new abbreviated test , we analyzed the sensitivity , specificity , and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUROC) on the KNHANES V-VI except for the KNHANES VI-2. Based on the two-factor structure of AUDIT , question ( Q) 3 and Q7 were finally selected for STAD. In validation , AUROC was significantly wider for STAD than for AUDIT-QF , which has the same number of questions. There was no significant difference between AUDIT-C , consisting of three questions , and STAD. It can be used as a simple and reliable screening test in clinical settings.
