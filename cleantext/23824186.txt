  The synchronous triacylglycerol ( TAG) production with the growth is a key step to lower the cost of the microalgae-based biofuel production. Phospholipid: diacylglycerol acyltransferase ( PDAT) has been identified recently and catalyzes the phospholipid contributing acyl group to diacylglycerol to synthesize TAG , and is considered as the important source of TAG in Using a chimeric Hsp70A-RbcS2 promoter , exogenous PDAT form The TAG production was enhanced in the regular cultivation without the nutrient stress by strengthening the conversion of polar lipid to TAG in
