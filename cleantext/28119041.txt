  There is no single standard chemotherapy regimen for elderly patients with advanced gastric cancer ( AGC). A phase III trial has confirmed that both capecitabine monotherapy and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin are well tolerated for elderly patients with AGC , but their economic influence in China is unknown. The purpose of this cost-effectiveness analysis was to estimate the effects of capecitabine monotherapy and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin in elderly patients with AGC on health and economic outcomes in China. We created a Markov model based on data from a Korean clinical phase III trial to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the treatment of elderly patients in the capecitabine monotherapy ( X) group and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin ( XELOX) group. The costs were obtained from published reports and the local health system. The utilities were assumed on the basis of the published literature. Costs , quality-adjusted life years ( QALYs) , and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ( ICER) were estimated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses ( Monte Carlo simulations) were performed. In the cost-effectiveness analysis , X had a lower total cost ( $ 45,731.68) and cost-effectiveness ratio ( $ 65,918.93/ QALY). The one-way sensitivity analysis suggested that the most influential parameter was the risk of requiring second-line chemotherapy in XELOX group. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted that the X regimen was cost-effective 100 % of the time , given a willingness-to-pay threshold of $ 26,598. Our findings show that the XELOX regimen is less cost-effective compared to the X regimen for elderly patients with AGC in China from a Chinese healthcare perspective.
