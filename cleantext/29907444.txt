  Visual assessment of diameter-stenosis on Computed Tomography Coronary Angiography ( CTCA) lacks specificity to determine functional significance of coronary artery stenosis. Percent-aggregate plaque volume ( % APV) and ASLA score , which incorporates Area of Stenosis , Lesion<symptom> length , and area of myocardium subtended estimated by APPROACH score ( Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease) have been described to predict lesion<symptom> specific ischaemia in focal lesions<symptom> with intermediate stenosis. Included were 81 patients ( mean age 64.7 ± 9 years , 62 % male; 94 vessels) who underwent 320- detector-row CTCA , invasive coronary angiography and fractional-flow-reserve ( FFR). We examined vessels with wide range of diameter stenosis ( mid to severe) and with multiple lesions<symptom>. Invasive FFR of ≤ 0.8 was considered functionally significant. The first 54 patients ( 62 vessels) formed the derivation cohort. ASLA score was the best predictor of FFR ≤ 0.8 ( AUC 0.83 , p < 0.001) compared to % APV ( 0.72) , CT > 50 % ( 0.76) , APPROACH score ( 0.79) , area-stenosis ( 0.73) , diameter-stenosis ( 0.74) , minimum-luminal-diameter ( 0.74) , minimal-luminal-area ( 0.72) , and lesion-length ( 0.67). ASLA score and not % APV , provided incremental predictive value when added to CT > 50 ( ( NRI 0.71 , p = 0.005) vs. ( NRI 0.01 , p = 0.96)). In the validation cohort of 27 patients ( 32 vessels) , the ASLA score ( AUC 0.85) was again a better predictor of FFR ≤ 0.8 compared to % APV ( 0.71) , CT > 50 % ( 0.66) and other CT indices. The AUC of ASLA score was superior to CTCA > 50 % ( p = 0.001). ASLA score is a novel predictor of functional significance of coronary stenosis and adds incremental predictive value to CT > 50 but % APV did not.
