  This research investigates the degrees of slipperiness felt by the participants who walk on contaminants applied to a floor surface to decide degrees of slipperiness for various contaminants. For the experiment , 30 participants walked on a floor to which six contaminants were applied. All participants took the analytic hierarchy process ( AHP)- based slipperiness questionnaire survey for the six kinds of contaminants , and the results were compared with the coefficient of friction. The results of slip risk from the AHP indicate that grease is the most slippery of the six contaminants , followed by diesel engine oil , hydraulic oil , cooking oil , water-soluble cutting oil , and water in a decreasing order of slipperiness. When the results of slip risk from the AHP are compared with the static coefficient of friction for each contaminant , the order of slip risk follows the same trend. Although the results of slip risk from the AHP coincide with the static coefficient of friction , further study would be needed to investigate this relationship. This study will contribute as reference material for future research on preventing industrial accidents that result in falls from high places due to slipping.
