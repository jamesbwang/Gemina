  The rapid deployment of renewable energy is resulting in significant energy security , climate change mitigation , and economic benefits. We demonstrate here the direct solar-energy harvesting and storage in a rechargeable solar-powered redox cell , which can be charged solely by solar irradiation. The cell follows a conventional redox-flow cell design with one integrated TiO
