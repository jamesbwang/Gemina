  The kinematic and behavioral components of the escape response can affect the outcomes of predator-prey interactions. For example , because sensory perception range can have spatial bias , and because turn duration before the initiation of escape locomotion can be smaller when prey is oriented away from predators , the prey 's body orientation relative to a predator at the onset of the escape response ( initial orientation) could affect whether prey successfully evade predators. We tested this hypothesis by recording the escape responses of juvenile red sea bream (
