  CD11c , also known as integrin alpha X , is the most widely used defining marker for dendritic cells ( DCs). CD11c can bind complement iC3b and mediate phagocytosis in vitro , for which it is also referred to as complement receptor 4. However , the functions of this prominent marker protein in DCs , especially in vivo , remain poorly defined. Here , in the process of studying DC activation and immune responses induced by cells lacking self-CD47 , we found that DC capture of CD47-deficient cells and DC activation was dependent on the integrin-signaling adaptor Talin1. Specifically , CD11c and its partner Itgb2 were required for DC capture of CD47-deficient cells. CD11b was not necessary for this process but could partially compensate in the absence of CD11c. Mice with DCs lacking Talin1 , Itgb2 , or CD11c were defective in supporting T-cell proliferation and differentiation induced by CD47-deficient cell associated antigen. These findings establish a critical role for CD11c in DC antigen uptake and activation in vivo. They may also contribute to understanding the functional mechanism of CD47-blockade therapies.
