  Previous literatures have reported the role of human micro RNA-1284 ( hsa-miR-1284 , in short miR-1284) in diverse cancers. However , its biological function in osteosarcoma pathogenesis remains unknown. In the present study , we investigated the potential role of miR-1284 in osteosarcoma. Expression of miR-1284 and high mobility group box 1 ( HMGB1) were examined in 80 tissues obtained from 40 patients. MiR-1284 level was measured in five osteosarcoma cell lines. Relative luciferase activity and HMGB1 expression were examined in MG-63 and U2OS cells transfected with wild-type or mutant 3 '- UTR of HMGB1 in the presence of miR-1284 mimics or miR-NC. Cell viability , colony formation , and cell migration were measured in MG-63 , U2OS and hFOB 1.19 cells , which were transfected with miR-1284 mimics or miR-NC. In the rescue experiments , recombinant HMGB1 plasmid was transfected into MG-63 and U2OS cells , and cell viability and migration were determined again. Our results indicated that relative level of miR-1284 was lower in tumor tissues compared with its adjacent tissues and it was found suppressed at lower levels in MG-63 and U2OS cell lines. Expression of HMGB1 is significantly elevated in tumor tissues and negatively correlated with miR-1284 expression. MiR-1284 exerted its function by directly binding to 3 '- UTR of HMGB1 and regulates expression of HMGB1. The overexpression of miR-1284 inhibited the cell proliferation and migration , and altered the protein expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT)- associated genes ( E-cadherin , N-cadherin , Vimentin , and Snail) , which was reversed by HMGB1 overexpression. In conclusion , miR-1284 can function as a new regulator to inhibit osteosarcoma cell proliferation and migration by targeting HMGB1.
