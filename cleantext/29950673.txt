  The numbers and types of cells constituting vertebrate neural tissues are determined by cellular mechanisms that couple neurogenesis to the proliferation of neural progenitor cells. Here we identified a role of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1) in the development of neural tissue , showing that it accelerates progenitor cell cycle progression and neurogenesis in mTORC1-hyperactive tuberous sclerosis complex 1 ( Tsc1)- deficient mouse retina. We also show that concomitant loss of immunoproteasome subunit Psmb9 , which is induced by Stat1 ( signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 1) , decelerates cell cycle progression of Tsc1-deficient mouse retinal progenitor cells and normalizes retinal developmental schedule. Collectively , our results establish a developmental role for mTORC1 , showing that it promotes neural development through activation of protein turnover via a mechanism involving the immunoproteasome.
