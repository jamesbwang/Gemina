  We present a three-color femtosecond Er/Yb: fiber laser enabling highly specific and standardized nonlinear optical manipulation of live cells. The system simultaneously provides bandwidth-limited 80-fs pulses with identical intensity envelope centered at wavelengths of 515 , 775 , and 1035 nm in the focus of a confocal microscope. We achieve this goal by combining high-order dispersion control via , for example , chirped fiber Bragg gratings with proper bandwidth management in each nonlinear conversion step. Wavelength-selective and noninterfering induction of deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) photoproducts and DNA strand breaks , as well as fluorescence photoactivation of a photoactivatable green fluorescent protein ( PA-GFP)- histone fusion protein , are demonstrated. The capability to introduce different types of DNA lesions<symptom> and perform photoswitching experiments in a selective manner is essential for quantitative studies on DNA repair and chromatin dynamics.
