  To investigate the effects of different concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA) on the maturation , differentiation and autophagy of Hepa1-6 cells. Hepa1-6 cells were treated with 0.1 , 1 , and 10 Âµmol/L ATRA , and the changes in the expressions of hepatic specific markers were detected using real-time PCR and Western blotting. Indocyanine green ( ICG) and periodic acid-schiff ( PAS) staining was used to assess the functional maturation of Hepa1-6 cells , and the cell-cell junction and autophagy were observed under transmission electron microscopy to determine the optimal concentration of ATRA for treatment. The expressions of autophagy-related markers in the cells were detected using Western blotting , and confocal microscopy was used to observe the autophagic flow in the cells transfected with ptfLC3 plasmid. Compared with the control cells , the hepatocytes treated with ATRA showed a concentration-dependent decrease in AFP expression and increase in the expressions of ALB , CK18 , TAT and ApoB. ICG and PAS staining revealed significantly increased number of positive cells after ATRA treatment. Following ATRA treatment , the cells exhibited obviously increased tight junctions , cytoskeleton and number of autophagosomes under transmission electron microscopy. ATRA treatment resulted in significantly increased the expressions of autophagy-related markers LC3-II , Beclin-1 , RAB7 and P62 and also an increased ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I ( P < 0.05). Confocal microscopy revealed obviously increased green and red spots in the cells after ATRA treatment. ATRA can induce the maturation and differentiation and enhance the level of autophagy in Hepa1-6 cells.
