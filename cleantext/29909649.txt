  Regulatory inspection of clinical trial is necessary in order for ( 1) assessing compliance with statutory requirements and regulatory requirement governing the conduct of clinical trials and ( 2) verifying the accuracy and reliability of clinical trial data submitted to regulatory agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) in support of research or marketing applications. This article provides an overview of clinical inspection process and issues that are commonly encountered during the conduct of clinical trials. In addition , a couple of sampling plans for clinical inspection of relatively large trials are proposed. The proposed statistical process for clinical inspection that will achieve a desired degree of inspection accuracy and reliability is useful when the resources of inspectors are limited. The proposed 2-stage sampling plan can be applied to clinical inspection for multicenter and/or multinational multicenter clinical trials.
