  This review explores the current place of metformin in the management of gestational diabetes ( GDM) and type 2 diabetes during pregnancy and lactation. The rationale and basic pharmacology of metformin usage in pregnancy is discussed along with the evidence from observational and randomized controlled trials in women with GDM or overt diabetes. There seems to be adequate evidence of efficacy and short-term safety of metformin in relation to maternal and neonatal outcomes in GDM , with possible benefits related to lower maternal weight gain and lower risk of neonatal hypoglycemia and macrosomia. Additionally , metformin offers the advantages of oral administration , convenience , less cost and greater acceptability. Metformin may , therefore , be considered in milder forms of GDM where glycemic goals are not attained by lifestyle modification. However , failure rate is likely to be higher in those with an earlier diagnosis of GDM , higher blood glucose , higher body mass index ( BMI) or previous history of GDM , and insulin remains the cornerstone of pharmacological treatment in such cases. The use of metformin in type 2 diabetes has been assessed in observational and small randomized trials. Metformin monotherapy in women with overt diabetes is highly unlikely to achieve glycemic targets. Hence , the use should be restricted as adjunct to insulin and may be considered in women with high insulin dose requirements or rapid weight gain. There is clearly a need for more clinical trials to assess the effect of combined insulin plus metformin therapy in pregnancy with type 2 diabetes. Additionally , there is a paucity of data on long-term effects in offspring exposed to metformin
