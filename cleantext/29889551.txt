  Homeopathic remedies ( HRs) contain odorant molecules such as flavonoids or terpenes and can lose their efficiency in presence of some competitive odors. Such similarities , along with extreme sensitivity of the olfactory system , widespread presence of olfactory receptors over all organic tissues ( where they have metabolic roles besides perception of odors) , and potential direct access to the brain through olfactory nerves ( ONs) and trigeminal nerves , may suggest the olfactory system as target for HRs. Recent works highlighted that HRs exist in a dual form , that is , a still molecular form at low dilution and a nanoparticulate form at high dilution , and that remnants of source remedy persist in extremely high dilutions. From the literature , both odorants and nanoparticles ( NPs) can enter the body through inhalation , digestive absorption , or through the skin , especially , NPs or viruses can directly reach the brain through axons of nerves. Assuming that HRs are recognized by olfactory receptors , their information could be transmitted to numerous tissues through receptor-ligand interaction , or to the brain by either activating the axon potential of ONs and trigeminal nerves or , in their nanoparticulate form , by translocating through axons of these nerves. Moreover , the nanoparticulate form may activate the immune system at multiple levels , induce systemic various biological responses through the pituitary axis and inflammation<symptom> factors , or modulate gene expression at the cellular level. As immunity , inflammation<symptom> , pituitary axis , and olfactory system are closely linked together , their permanent interaction triggered by olfactory receptors may thus ensure homeostasis.
