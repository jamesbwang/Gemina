  Animal models of mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI) suggest that metabolic changes in the brain occur immediately after a mechanical injury to the head. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( To determine concentrations of glutamate and GABA in the brain acutely after mTBI and throughout 2 months of recovery. Concentrations of glutamate and GABA were obtained using 1H-MRS in nine individuals who had suffered an mTBI and nine control individuals in two brain regions of interest: the primary motor cortex ( M1) , and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC) , and at three different time points post injury: 72-hours , 2-weeks , and 2 months post-injury. There were no differences between groups in concentrations of glutamate or GABA , or the ratio of glutamate to GABA in M1. In the DLPFC , glutamate concentration was lower in the mTBI group compared to controls at 72-hours post-injury ( d = 1.02) , and GABA concentration was lower in the mTBI group at 72-hours and 2 weeks post-injury ( d = 0.81 and d = 1.21 , respectively). The ratio of glutamate to GABA in the DLPFC was higher in the mTBI group at 2-weeks post-injury ( d = 1.63). These results suggest that changes in glutamate and GABA concentrations in the brain may be region-specific and may depend on the amount of time that has elapsed post-injury.
