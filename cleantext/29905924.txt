  Vitamin D status is primarily dependent upon sun exposure and dietary sources , however genetic , cultural , and environmental factors can have a modulating role in the measured amount. One under-reported factor is the effect of regular living quarters on the degree of sun exposure. Herein , we assess vitamin D status in the blood of Rhesus monkeys ( Macaca mulatta) housed in high amounts of sunlight ( corn-cribs) , medium sunlight ( corrals with shaded areas) , and minimal sunlight ( quarantine cages). Fifty-five male Rhesus monkeys , aged 1 to 31 years were housed in varying amounts of sun exposure at the Caribbean Primate Research Center. Serum was collected and analyzed for 25 OH Vitamin D which is the preferred metabolite for determination of Vitamin D using High Performance Liquid Chromatography ( HPLC). 25 OH Vitamin D levels in blood were significantly greater in corn-cribhoused monkeys than in corral or quarantine-housed animals ( p > 0.01 and p > 0.001 respectively). Significant differences of serum levels were not found when ages of animals housed in the same environment were compared. Monkeys housed in a tropical environment with the greatest amount of exposure to sunlight maintain the highest serum levels of 25 OH vitamin D independent of age. These findings emphasize the importance of documenting the environment in which subjects typically spend their time when Vitamin D results are interpreted.
