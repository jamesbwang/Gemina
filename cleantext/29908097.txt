  Paracetamol overdosing may cause liver injury including fulminant liver failure due to generation of the toxic metabolites , N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine ( NAPQI) and p-benzoquinone ( p-BQ). Herein , the chelating agent , N , N '- Bis ( 2-mercaptoethyl) isophthalamide ( NBMI) , was examined for its potential ability to entrap NAPQI and p-BQ and to prevent paracetamol-induced liver injury. Both NBMI and the conventional paracetamol antidote N-acetylcysteine ( NAC) were investigated with regard to their abilities to scavenge the NAPQI and p-BQ in a Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1-dependent screening assay. Stoichiometric evaluations indicated that NBMI was able to entrap these metabolites more efficiently than NAC. Furthermore , oral administration of either NBMI ( 680 mg/kg) or NAC ( 680 mg/kg) prevented the development of the characteristic liver necrosis<symptom> and elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase in a mouse model for paracetamol-induced liver injury. In summary , these results show that NBMI is able to entrap the toxic metabolites NAPQI and p-BQ and to prevent paracetamol-induced liver injury in mice.
