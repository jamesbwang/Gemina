  Chirality sensing of choline derivatives is achieved by a self-assembled , racemic triple anion helicate cage which exhibits induced circular dichroism ( ICD) upon encapsulation of a chiral guest. The host-guest interactions were illustrated by NMR , crystal structure , CD and DFT calculations. The absolute configurations and ee values were determined by ICD.
