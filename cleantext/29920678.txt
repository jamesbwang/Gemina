  To review the clinical and radiographic characteristics of orthostatic headache<symptom> following suboccipital craniectomy without CSF leak after encountering 2 such patients. Orthostatic headache<symptom> may occur without CSF leak , suggesting alternative mechanisms for postural head<symptom> pain<symptom> in some patients. Patients who were referred for orthostatic headache<symptom> and suspected CSF leak within 1 year after suboccipital craniectomy but who had negative post-operative head and spine MRI , normal radioisotope cisternography , and normal or elevated CSF opening pressure were identified and their medical records reviewed. Two patients satisfied all inclusion criteria. One underwent suboccipital craniectomy for treatment of Chiari malformation type I in adolescence; the same surgical approach was used to resect a posterior fossa meningioma in the second. Both patients had non-orthostatic headache<symptom> before surgery and newly developed orthostatic headache<symptom> later. Delay from surgery to orthostatic headache<symptom> onset was variable ( 2-9 months). Headaches<symptom> were predominantly occipital and pressure-like , worsened by upright posture<symptom> , bending forward , and exertion. MRI consistently showed adequate decompression of the posterior fossa. Epidural blood patches were unhelpful in the one patient in whom they were performed. Orthostatic headaches<symptom> may develop after suboccipital craniectomy in the absence of CSF leak. Possible mechanisms include ( 1) scarring of the dura in the posterior fossa that leads to compensatory increased distensibility of lumbar dura and ( 2) sensitization of mechanosensitive dural nociceptors from altered skull-dura apposition.
