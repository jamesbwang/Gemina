  Methamphetamine ( METH) , an amphetamine derivate , may increase the risk of developing Parkinson 's disease ( PD). Human and animal studies have shown that METH produces persistent dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the nigrostriatal pathway , despite initial partial recovery. To determine the processes leading to early compensation , we studied the detailed morphology and distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive fibers ( TH-ir) classified by their thickness ( types I-IV) before and after METH. Applying three established neurotoxic regimens of METH: single high dose ( 1 × 30 mg/kg) , multiple lower doses ( 3 × 5 mg/kg) or ( 3 × 10 mg/kg) , we show that METH primarily damages type I fibers ( the thinner ones) , and to a much lesser extend types II-IV fibers including sterile axons. The striatal TH terminal partial recovery process , consisting of a progressive regrowth increases in types II , III , and IV fibers , demonstrated by co-localization of GAP-43 , a sprouting marker , was observed 3 days post-METH treatment. In addition , we demonstrate the presence of growth-cone-like TH-ir structures , indicative of new terminal generation as well as improvement in motor functions after 3 days. A temporal relationship was observed between decreases in TH-expression and increases in silver staining , a marker of degeneration. Striatal regeneration was associated with an increase in astroglia and decrease in microglia expression , suggesting a possible role for the neuroimmune system in regenerative processes. Identification of regenerative compensatory mechanisms in response to neurotoxic agents could point to novel mechanisms in countering the neurotoxicity and/or enhancing the regenerative processes.
