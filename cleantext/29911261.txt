  Oxytocin ( OT) has drawn the attention of researchers since 1930. Since then , many aspects of oxytocin have been uncovered , such as reproductive functions , dampening anxiety<symptom> , enhancing socioemotional behavior , or regulating genomic effects on a cellular level. Here , we want to focus on the interaction between the OT system and the stress/corticotropin-releasing factor ( CRF)- system of the brain. Depending on the nature of the stressor , OT is released simultaneously or directly after the stress from the neurohypophysis into the periphery and/or via somato-dendritic release in stress-sensitive brain areas. This stress-induced OT release might serve to modulate or dampen the stress response; however , the functional relevance is not yet fully understood. In this review , we will describe the effects of OT and discuss the interplay between OT and CRF on a cellular , physiological , and behavioral level.
