  This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of and risk factors for colonization and acquisition of carbapenem-resistant ( CR) Gram-negative bacteria ( GNB) among patients admitted to intensive care units ( ICUs) in two tertiary care hospitals in northern Thailand. Screening of rectal swab specimens for CR-GNB was performed on patients at ICU admission and discharge. The phenotypes and genotypes of all isolates were determined. Risk factors were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. The overall carriage rate of CR-GNB at admission was 11.6 % ( 32/275) , with the most predominant species carried being
