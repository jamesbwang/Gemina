  A critical aspect of understanding the regulation of signal transduction is not only to identify the protein-protein interactions that govern assembly of signaling pathways , but also to understand how those pathways are regulated in time and space. In this report , we have applied both gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses to assess the role of the non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase FER in activation of the HGF Receptor protein tyrosine kinase MET. Overexpression of FER led to direct phosphorylation of several signaling sites in MET , including Tyr1349 , but not the activation loop residues Tyr1234/5; in contrast , suppression of FER by RNAi revealed that phosphorylation of both a C-terminal signaling site ( Tyr1349) and the activation loop ( Tyr1234/5) were influenced by the function of this kinase. Adaptin Î² , a component of the adaptor protein complex 2 ( AP-2) that links clathrin to receptors in coated vesicles , was recruited to MET following FER-mediated phosphorylation. Furthermore , we provide evidence to support a role of FER in maintaining plasma membrane distribution of MET and thereby delaying protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B-mediated inactivation of the receptor. Simultaneous up-regulation of FER and down-regulation of PTP1B observed in ovarian carcinoma-derived cell lines would be expected to contribute to persistent activation of HGF-MET signaling , suggesting that targeting of both FER and MET may be an effective strategy for therapeutic intervention in ovarian cancer.
