  Geopolymers belong to an interesting class of X-ray amorphous polycondensed aluminosilicate ceramic solids. The high mechanical strength , chemical stability in basic conditions , and water insolubility make geopolymers a unique solid support in separation science. This work describes a new straightforward synthetic procedure for making spherical porous geopolymer particles with high surface area which are amenable for chromatographic purposes. In-depth physicochemical evaluation of geopolymers is conducted via particle size distribution , porosity measurements , X-ray diffraction , pH titration , and energy-dispersive spectroscopy and compared with silica , titania , and zirconia. Chromatographic selectivity shows that the surface chemistry of geopolymers has strong hydrophilic and electrostatic character , which makes it different from 36 chromatographic columns. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography in columns packed with geopolymer particles shows different selectivity than that in silica columns , with excellent peak shapes. Phosphate or fluoride additives are not required as they are for zirconia or titania phase.
