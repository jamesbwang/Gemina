  Current health technology assessment ( HTA) methods guidelines for medical devices may benefit from contributions by biomedical and clinical engineers. Our study aims to: ( i) review and identify gaps in the current HTA guidelines on medical devices , ( ii) propose recommendations to optimize the impact of HTA for medical devices , and ( iii) reach a consensus among biomedical engineers on these recommendations. A gray literature search of HTA agency Web sites for assessment methods guidelines on devices was conducted. The International Federation of Medical and Biological Engineers ( IFMBE) then convened a structured focus group , with experts from different fields , to identify potential gaps in the current HTA guidelines , and to develop recommendations to fill these perceived gaps. The thirty recommendations generated from the focus group were circulated in a Delphi survey to eighty-five biomedical and clinical engineers. Thirty-two panelists , from seventeen countries , participated in the Delphi survey. The responses showed a strong agreement on twenty-seven of thirty recommendations. Some uncertainties remain about the methods to accurately assess the effectiveness and safety , and interoperability of a medical device with other devices or within the clinical setting. As medical devices differ from drug therapies , current HTA methods may not accurately reflect the conclusions of their assessment. Recommendations informed by the focus group discussions and Delphi survey responses aimed to address the perceived gaps , and to provide a more integrated approach in medical device assessments in combining engineering with other perspectives , such as clinical , economic , patient , human factors , ethical , and environmental.
