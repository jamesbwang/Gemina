  Migraine has a predilection for female sex and the course of symptoms is influenced by life stage ( presence of menstrual cycle , pregnancy , puerperium , menopause) and use of hormone therapy , such as hormonal contraception and hormone replacement therapy. Hormonal changes figure among common migraine triggers , especially sudden estrogen drop. Moreover , estrogens can modulate neuronal excitability , through serotonin , norepinephrine , dopamine , and endorphin regulation , and they interact with the vascular endothelium of the brain. The risk of vascular disease , and ischemic stroke in particular , is increased in women with migraine with aura ( MA) , but the link is unclear. One hypothesis posits for a causal association: migraine may cause clinical or subclinical brain lesions<symptom> following repeated episodes of cortical spreading depression<symptom> ( CSD) and a second hypothesis that may explain the association between migraine and vascular diseases is the presence of common risk factors and comorbidities. Estrogens can play a differential role depending on their action on healthy or damaged endothelium , their endogenous or exogenous origin , and the duration of their treatment. Moreover , platelet activity is increased in migraineurs women , and it is further stimulated by estrogens.This review article describes the course of migraine during various life stages , with a special focus on its hormonal pathogenesis and the associated risk of vascular diseases.
