  A goal of effective electronic health record provider documentation platforms is to provide an efficient , concise , and comprehensive notation system that will effectively reflect the clinical course , including the diagnoses , treatments , and interventions. The aim is to fully redesign and standardize the provider documentation process , seeking improvement in documentation based on ongoing All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Group-based coding records , while maintaining noninferiority comparing provider satisfaction to our existing documentation process. We estimated the fiscal impact of improved documentation based on changes in expected hospital payments. Employing a multidisciplinary collaborative approach , we created an integrated clinical platform that captures data entry from the obstetrical suite , delivery room , neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU) nursing and respiratory therapy staff. It provided the sole source for hospital provider documentation in the form of a history and physical exam , daily progress notes , and discharge summary. Health maintenance information , follow-up appointments , and running contemporaneous updated hospital course information have selected shared entry and common viewing by the NICU team. The interventions were to ( 1) improve provider awareness of appropriate documentation through a provider education handout and follow-up group discussion and ( 2) fully redesign and standardize the provider documentation process building from the native Epic-based software. The measures were ( 1) hospital coding department review of all NICU admissions and 3M All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Group-based calculations of severity of illness , risk of mortality , and case mix index scores; ( 2) balancing measure: provider time utilization case study and survey; and ( 3) average expected hospital payment based on acuity-based clinical logic algorithm and payer mix. We compared preintervention ( October 2015-October 2016) to postintervention ( November 2016-May 2017) time periods and saw: ( 1) significant improvement in All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Group-derived severity of illness , risk of mortality , and case mix index ( monthly average severity of illness scores increased by 11.1 % , P = .008; monthly average risk of mortality scores increased by 13.5 % , P = .007; and monthly average case mix index scores increased by 7.7 % , P = .009); ( 2) time study showed increased time to complete history and physical and progress notes and decreased time to complete discharge summary ( history and physical exam: time allocation increased by 47 % , P = .05; progress note: time allocation increased by 91 % , P < .001; discharge summary: time allocation decreased by 41 % , P = .03); ( 3) survey of all providers: overall there was positive provider perception of the new documentation process based on a survey of the provider group; ( 4) significantly increased hospital average expected payments: comparing the preintervention and postintervention study periods , there was a US $ 14,020 per month per patient increase in average expected payment for hospital charges ( P < .001). There was no difference in payer mix during this time period. A problem-based NICU documentation electronic health record more effectively improves documentation without dissatisfaction by the participating providers and improves hospital estimations of All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Group-based revenue.
