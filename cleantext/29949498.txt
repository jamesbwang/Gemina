  The gut of insects harbors a yeast community that is still poorly understood. Here , a novel species of the ascomycetous genus Blastobotrys<pathogen> is proposed based on a yeast strain isolated from the larval gut of the silkworm Bombyx mori ( Order Lepidoptera). The novel species is closely related to Blastobotrys<pathogen> aristata and Blastobotrys elegans<pathogen> on the basis of the results of molecular phylogenetic analyses. A preliminary screening revealed that it produces 1.5 g l
