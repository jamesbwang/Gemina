  To describe MR imaging features of presumed vascular plexi in the periscapular ( PSC) and retroclavicular ( RC) locations. 443 consecutive MR studies performed as `` brachial plexus '' protocol ( axialT1-W and sagittal STIR) were reviewed for presence , size and characteristics of PSC and RC plexi. Presumed PSC and RC vascular plexi were present in 10 %. Both plexi more commonly occurred on the left side. Percutaneous biopsy ( n = 1) yielded no vascular neoplasm. RC and PSC vascular plexi are commonly encountered on routine brachial plexus MR imaging and may represent variant vascular networks , as they are frequently found on the contralateral asymptomatic side.
