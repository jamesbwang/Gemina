  In the nervous system , myelination of axons enables rapid impulse conduction and is a specialized function of glial cells. Myelinating glia are the last cell type to emerge in the evolution of vertebrate nervous systems , presumably in ancient jawed vertebrates ( gnathostomata) because jawless vertebrates ( agnathans) lack myelin. We have hypothesized that , in these unmyelinated species , evolutionary progenitors of myelinating cells must have existed that should still be present in contemporary agnathan species. Here , we used advanced electron microscopic techniques to reveal axon-glia interactions in the sea lamprey
