  Reported here is a simple and rapid static headspace gas chromatography ( SHS-GC) method for the determination of trace solvents including ethanol , isopropanol , n-butanol , 1,4-dioxane , tetrahydrofuran , acetonitrile , methanol and acetone which commonly used in drug production process. Natural deep eutectic solvents ( NADESs) are firstly used as the matrix medium for this method , which provided high sensitivity for residual solvents detection. With the optimized method , validation experiments were performed and the data showed excellent linearity for all the solvents ( R
