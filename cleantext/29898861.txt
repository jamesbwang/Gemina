  Eosinophilic cholecystitis<disease> is a rare entity that was first described in 1949 and is clinically indistinguishable from calculous cholecystitis<disease> Histologically , there is transmural inflammatory infiltration of the gallbladder wall , more than 90 % of which is composed of eosinophils. The aim of the present article was to review the prevalence of eosinophilic cholecystitis<disease> and analyze the clinical and surgical characteristics of patients diagnosed with the disease that were operated on at our hospital. A retrospective study was conducted on patients that underwent cholecystectomy and whose postoperative histopathologic diagnosis was eosinophilic cholecystitis<disease> , within the time frame of January 2000 and August 2014. The demographic , clinical , paraclinical , surgical , and histopathologic variables were described. Over a period of 14 years , a total of 7,494 patients underwent cholecystectomy. Of those patients , 12 had a postoperative histologic diagnosis of eosinophilic cholecystitis<disease> Mean patient age for disease presentation was 39 years ( Â± 11 years) , and female sex was predominant , with 7 cases. All the patients had concomitant gallstones and 10 patients presented with acute cholecystitis<disease> that required urgent cholecystectomy. All the cases were considered idiopathic. We found a prevalence of 0.16 % , corresponding to 1 case for every 625 cholecystectomies performed at our hospital. We found a low prevalence of eosinophilic cholecystitis<disease> ( 0.16 %) in our study population. The clinical manifestations were similar to those of calculous cholecystitis<disease> Cholecystectomy is adequate treatment in patients with idiopathic disease.
