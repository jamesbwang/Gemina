  Glycine decarboxylase ( GLDC) gene is frequently upregulated in various types of cancer including lung , prostate and brain. It catabolizes glycine to yield 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate , an important substrate in one-carbon metabolism for nucleotide synthesis. In this study , we used exon splicing modulating steric hindrance antisense oligonucleotide ( shAON) to suppress GLDC expression and investigated its effect on pyruvate metabolism
