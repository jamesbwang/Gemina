  Lung cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide , and the incidence continues to rise. Although many prognostic factors have been identified , the clinical characteristics and outcomes in Korean lung cancer patients are not well defined. Of the 23,254 new lung cancer cases registered at the Korea Central Cancer Registry in 2013 , total 489 patients from 19 hospitals were abstracted by the Korean Central Cancer Registry. The clinical data retrospectively analyzed , patients were followed up until December 2015. The median age was 69 years ( interquartile range , 60-74 years); 65.4 % were male and 62.1 % were ever-smokers. Cough<symptom> was the most common initial symptom ( 33.5 %); 13.1 % of patients were asymptomatic. While squamous cell carcinoma was the most common subtype in male patients ( 37.2 %) , adenocarcinoma was the most frequent histological type in all patients ( 48.7 %) and females ( 76.3 %). The majority of patients received treatment ( 76.5 %) , which included surgery , radiation therapy , and chemotherapy. Older age ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 1.037) , lower body mass index ( HR , 0.904) , ever-smoker ( HR , 2.003) , small cell lung cancer ( HR , 1.627) , and distant metastasis ( HR , 3.990) were independent predictors of mortality. Patients without symptoms ( HR , 0.387) and without treatment ( HR , 0.364) were associated with a favorable outcome in multivariate Cox analysis. Lung cancer in Korea occurs predominantly in elderly patients , with adenocarcinoma being the most frequent subtype. The prognosis was poorer in ever-smokers and older , malnourished , and untreated patients with advanced lung cancer.
