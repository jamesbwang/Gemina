  In many countries , caves can pose an economic interest for the authorities and stakeholders. The development of a show cave requires , apart from the conservation issues , to ensure the human safety by minimising the exposure to radon for cave personnel and visitors. Radon levels can vary widely from cave to cave , being directly correlated with different internal and external factors. It is therefore important to monitor radon levels before establishing the number of personnel required , so that they are not exposed to health-threatening levels of radiation. A long-term radon survey was carried out for this purpose in five show caves of Romania. The study pointed out the existence of high-radon potential areas inside the caves with concentrations reaching up to 4024 Bqm-3 , thus posing radiological hazard to cave personnel and researchers who develop activities underground. Further research focused on personal dosimetry will be necessary for an efficient management of occupational risk.
