  Sexual assault ( SA) is common , and recent sexual assault is associated with suicidal ideation and prescription opioid ( PO) use. PO use is also associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation. The current study examined suicidal ideation among adults seeking medical and psychological follow-up care after a SA medical forensic examination based on PO use and prior SA. Adults ( n = 60) who received a SA medical forensic exam at the emergency room within 120 h of a SA were invited to receive medical and psychological follow-up care , which included a questionnaire about current mental health symptoms. Results from a linear regression model revealed that more acute stress symptoms were associated with higher suicidal ideation. Further , there was a significant association between PO use and suicidal ideation among those with a prior SA such that those with a prior SA and who used POs reported more severe suicidal ideation than those with a prior SA who did not use POs. Routine screening at the emergency department for PO use and prior SA may help prevention efforts for suicide among adults who recently experienced SA.
