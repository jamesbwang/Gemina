  The analyses of geographic variations in the prevalence of major chronic conditions , such as overweight and obesity , are an important public health tool to identify `` hot spots '' and inform allocation of funding for policy and health promotion campaigns , yet rarely performed. Here we aimed at exploring , for the first time in Luxembourg , potential geographic patterns in overweight/obesity prevalence in the country , adjusted for several demographic , socioeconomic , behavioural and health status characteristics. Data came from 720 men and 764 women , 25-64 years old , who participated in the European Health Examination Survey in Luxembourg ( 2013-2015). To investigate the geographical variation , geo-additive semi-parametric mixed model and Bayesian modelisations based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for inference were performed. Large disparities in the prevalence of overweight and obesity were found between municipalities , with the highest rates of obesity found in 3 municipalities located in the South-West of the country. Bayesian approach also underlined a nonlinear effect of age on overweight and obesity in both genders ( significant in men) and highlighted the following risk factors: 1. country of birth for overweight in men born in a non-European country ( Posterior Odds Ratio ( POR): 3.24 ( 1.61-8.69)) and women born in Portugal ( POR: 2.44 ( 1.25-4.43)) , 2. low educational level ( secondary or below) for overweight ( POR: 1.66 ( 1.06-2.72)) and obesity ( POR: 2.09 ( 1.05-3.65)) in men , 3. single marital status for obesity in women ( POR: 2.20 ( 1.24-3.91)) , 4. fair ( men: POR: 3.19 ( 1.58-6.79) , women: POR: 2.24 ( 1.33-3.73)) to very bad health perception ( men: POR: 15.01 ( 2.16-98.09)) for obesity , 5. sleeping more than 6 hours for obesity in unemployed men ( POR: 3.66 ( 2.02-8.03)). Protective factors highlighted were: 1. single marital status against overweight ( POR: ( 0.60 ( 0.38-0.96))) and obesity ( POR: 0.39 ( 0.16-0.84)) in men , 2. the fact to be widowed against overweight in women ( POR: ( 0.30 ( 0.07-0.86)) , as well as a non European country of birth ( POR: 0.49 ( 0.19-0.98)) , tertiary level of education ( POR: 0.34 ( 0.18-0.64)) , moderate alcohol consumption ( POR: 0.54 ( 0.36-0.90)) and aerobic physical activity practice ( POR: 0.44 ( 0.27-0.77)) against obesity in women. A double burden of environmental exposure due to historic mining and industrial activities and past economic vulnaribility in the South-West of the country may have participated to the higher prevalence of obesity found in this region. Other demographic , socioeconomic , behavioural and health status covariates could have been involved as well.
