  This study probe the human health risk of fluoride ( F) , arsenic ( As) , and selenium ( Se) and their daily intake available quantity to human through different sources in different regions of Shaanxi , China. For this purpose , a number of samples , including coal and coal wastes , rocks , soil , and vegetables were collected from south Qinling Mountain stone-like coal ( Geo type-I) , Binxian-Jurassic ( Geo type-II) , Hancheng Permo-Carboniferous ( Geo type-III) , and countryside ( Huanglong County) of Shaanxi province. All these samples were analyzed through atomic fluorescence spectroscopy and combustion hydrolysis methods. Results showed that Geo type-I was enriched with As , Se , and F , Geo type-II , III , and the countryside were slightly enriched with As and F and deficient in Se. The average daily intake ( ADI) of Se in Geo type-I was 0.005-0.0045 , Geo type-II 0.0005-0.0004 , Geo type-III 0.0006-0.0005 , and countryside 0.0002-0.001 in mg kg
