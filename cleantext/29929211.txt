  Dehydroascorbate reductase ( DHAR) plays an important role in stress responses , but the transcriptional regulation of DHAR in response to abiotic stress is still poorly understood. In this study , we isolated a novel R2R3-type MYB transcription factor from Pyrus betulaefolia by yeast one-hybrid screening , designated as PbrMYB5. PbrMYB5 was localized in the nucleus and could bind specifically to the promoter of PbrDHAR2. PbrMYB5 was greatly induced by cold and salt , but slightly by dehydration<symptom> Overexpression of PbrMYB5 in tobacco conferred enhanced tolerance to chilling stresses , whereas down-regulation of PbrMYB5 in Pyrus betulaefolia by virus-induced gene silencing ( VIGS) resulted in elevated chilling sensitivity. Transgenic tobacco exhibited higher expression levels of DHAR2 and accumulated larger amount of AsA than the WT plants. VIGS of PbrMYB5 in Pyrus betulaefolia down-regulated PbrDHAR2 abundance and decreased AsA level , accompanied by an increased sensitivity to the chilling stress. Taken together , these results demonstrated that PbrMYB5 is an activator of AsA biosynthesis and may play a positive role in chilling tolerance , at least in part , due to the modulation of AsA synthesis by regulating the PbrDHAR2 expression.
