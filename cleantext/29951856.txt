  The advancement of human knowledge has historically followed the pattern of one-step growth ( the same pattern followed by microorganisms in laboratory culture conditions). In this way , each new important discovery opened the door to multiple secondary breakthroughs , eventually reaching a `` plateau '' when new findings emerged. Microbiology research has usually followed this pattern , but often the conclusions attained from experimentation/observation were either equivocal or altogether false , causing important delays in the advancement of this science. This mini-review deals with some of these documented scientific errors , but the aim is not to include every mistake , but to select those that are paramount to the advance of Microbiology.
