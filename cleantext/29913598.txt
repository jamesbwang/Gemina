  The role that land-use and socioeconomic factors exert on consolidating land degradation ( LD) processes is a major research issue. However , intensity and type of the impact played by LD on such land use factors is still underexplored. The present study investigates the role of LD on land-use change ( LUC) trajectories of land abandonment ( LA) and urban expansion ( URB) in the three geographical repartitions ( North , Centre , South) of Italy between 1990 and 2012 , by means of the Environmental Niche Factor Analysis ( ENFA). ENFA is a multivariate approach originally introduced in the analysis of animal ecology allowing to compute habitat suitability ( HS) models without requiring presence/absence data. Four environmental quality indices about climate ( CQI) , soil ( SQI) , vegetation ( VQI) and land management ( MQI) have been analyzed for the years 1990 and 2000 and related to the trajectories of LA and URB , respectively , for the time periods 1990-2000 and 2000-2012. Empirical results have indicated that different driving forces are linked to LA and URB , and that for each trajectory , the role of some forces may change over time. Evidence shows that soil quality and low human pressure represent the main drivers of LA. By contrast , as for URB , high human pressure represented the main driving factor throughout the country , both during 1990-2000 and 2000-2012. The HS maps show the probability arrangement of LA and URB in the three geographical repartitions. Starting from this work , further research is increasingly required to implement prediction models of future LA and URB trajectories according to the current land quality status.
