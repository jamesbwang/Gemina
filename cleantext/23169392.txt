  Chordomas are rare , slow-growing , locally aggressive bone tumors arising from embryonic remnants of the notochord. Distant metastases most commonly involve the lung , liver , axial skeleton , skin , and lymph nodes. Humeral metastases are extremely rare. We report the case of a recurrent chordoma with humeral metastasis , complicated with pathologic fracture. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed multiple hypermetabolic skeletal lesions<symptom> , corresponding to the symptoms. Our report suggests that positron emission tomography-computed tomography is useful for evaluation of recurrence and distant metastases of chordomas.
