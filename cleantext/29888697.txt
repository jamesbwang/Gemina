  This study aimed to compare the hearing results of two different stapedotomy techniques used in the clinic at different time points. An endoscopic surgery group ( group 1; n = 37) were compared retrospectively with a microscopic surgery group ( group 2; n = 57). A small fenestra and Teflon piston technique were used in all patients. Bone cement was used for fixation between the prosthesis and incus in the endoscopic group only. Bone conduction threshold and air-bone gap were used as the comparison parameters. The pre-operative air-bone gap was 31.26 dB in group 1 and 32.51 dB in group 2. The post-operative air-bone gap was 8.93 dB in group 1 and 14.28 dB in group 2. There was a significant difference between the groups in post-operative air-bone gaps. There was no significant difference between the groups in post-operative bone conduction thresholds. The endoscopic technique using bone cement fixation was better for closing the air-bone gap.
