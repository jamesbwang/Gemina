  The aim of this research was to valorize onion skins<disease> , an under-utilized agricultural by-product , into pectic oligosaccharides ( POS) , compounds with potential health benefits. To achieve high hydrolysis performance with the multi-activity enzyme Viscozyme L , an innovative approach was investigated based on a cross-flow continuous membrane enzyme bioreactor ( EMR). The influence of the various process conditions ( residence time , enzyme concentration , substrate concentration) was investigated on productivity and yield. The composition of the POS mixtures in terms of mono- and oligosaccharides was assessed at the molecular level. At optimized conditions , a stable POS production with 22.0 g/L/h volumetric productivity and 4.5 g/g POS/monosaccharides was achieved. Compared to previous results obtained in batch for the enzyme Viscozyme L , EMR provided a 3-5 Ã— higher volumetric productivity for the smallest POS. Moreover , it gave competitive results even when compared to batch production with a pure endo-galacturonase enzyme , demonstrating its feasibility for efficient POS production.
