  This study validated enterprise data warehouse ( EDW) data for a cohort of hospitalized patients with a primary diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA). 247 patients with 319 admissions for DKA ( ICD-9 code 250.12 , 250.13 , or 250. xx with biochemical criteria for DKA) were admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital from 1/1/2010 to 9/1/2013. Validation was performed by electronic medical record ( EMR) review of 10 % of admissions ( N = 32). Classification of diabetes type ( Type 1 vs. Type 2) and DKA clinical status were compared between the EMR review and EDW data. Key findings included incorrect classification of diabetes type in 5 of 32 ( 16 %) admissions and indeterminable classification in 5 admissions. DKA was not present , based on the review , in 11 of 32 ( 34 %) admissions. DKA was not present , based on biochemical criteria , in 15 of 32 ( 47 %) admissions. This study found that EDW data have substantial errors. Some discrepancies can be addressed by refining the EDW query code , while others , related to diabetes classification and DKA diagnosis , can not be corrected without improving clinical coding accuracy , consistency of medical record documentation , or EMR design. These results support the need for comprehensive validation of data for complex clinical populations obtained through data repositories such as the EDW.
