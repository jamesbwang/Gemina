  Biological wastewater treatment has been widely applied to municipal/domestic wastewater treatment systems. However , low temperature significantly decreases process performance. Furthermore , increasingly stringent effluent discharge standards are causing wastewater treatment facilities to have to improve and maintain contaminants removal under low temperature. Hence , this review aims to summarize strategies for enhanced treatment of municipal/domestic wastewater at low temperature. First , mechanisms of the effects of low temperature on wastewater treatment , including physiological characteristics , microbial growth rate , microbial activity , microbial community structure and sludge settleability , are analyzed. Strategies for performance intensifications at low temperature , mainly operational parameters regulation , bioaugmentation , biofilm technology , chemical phosphorus precipitation and application of novel process technologies , are then reviewed. Finally , future directions to address low temperature wastewater are highlighted. A special emphasis is given to the application of novel process/technology configurations to enhance process performance at low temperature in practical engineering.
