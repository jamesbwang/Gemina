  By combining analytical ultracentrifugation ( AUC) in liquid phase and scanning mobility particle sizer ( SMPS) in the gas phase , additional information on the particle size and morphology has been obtained for rigid particles. In this paper , we transfer this concept to soft particles , allowing us to analyze the size and molar mass of the short side chain perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer Aquivion
