  Although three recent trials showed a significant stroke risk reduction after tPFOc , the impact on pooled evidence deserves attention and individual statistical power is limited. We aimed to pool available randomised clinical trials ( RCT) to assess whether tPFOc is more effective and safe than antithrombotic therapy alone ( ATA). Major electronic databases and tangential sources were searched and 6 trials ( 3560 patients) identified. At a median follow-up of 3.6 ( 2.0-5.2) years ( 13930 person-years) , the risk of stroke was significantly lower after tPFOc compared with ATA ( HR 0.28 , 95 % CI 0.12 ─ 0.64 , p = 0.003). Significant heterogeneity was detected ( I2 = 66.1 %) , though single trials did not significantly influence the results. Reconstructed time-to-event data revealed that tPFOc benefit accrues approximately after 1 year and persists over time without significant variations ( 96.4 % versus 88.0 %; HR 0.25 , 95 % CI 0.09 ─ 0.66 , p = 0.005; NNT = 11). Although results showed a greater benefit in patients < 45 years old , male , and with substantial shunt , interaction between subgroups was not significant. Trial sequential analysis showed that accumulated evidence is sufficient. However , tPFOc did not confer protection against transient ischemic attack ( TIA; HR 0.69 , 95 % CI 0.31 ─ 1.54 , p = 0.365) and a significant excess in atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> was observed ( OR 4.99 , 95 % CI 1.99 ─ 10.10 , p < 0.001). Major bleeding and migraine were comparable between treatments. Compared with ATA , tPFOc reduces the risk of stroke at long-term follow-up but no benefit is observed in terms of TIA. Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> is higher after tPFOc , while major bleeding and migraine are comparable between groups.
