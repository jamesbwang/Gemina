  Recent open-label trials show that psychedelics , such as ayahuasca , hold promise as fast-onset antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression<symptom> To test the antidepressant effects of ayahuasca , we conducted a parallel-arm , double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in 29 patients with treatment-resistant depression<symptom> Patients received a single dose of either ayahuasca or placebo. We assessed changes in depression<symptom> severity with the Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression<symptom> Rating Scale ( MADRS) and the Hamilton Depression<symptom> Rating scale at baseline , and at 1 ( D1) , 2 ( D2) , and 7 ( D7) days after dosing. We observed significant antidepressant effects of ayahuasca when compared with placebo at all-time points. MADRS scores were significantly lower in the ayahuasca group compared with placebo at D1 and D2 ( p = 0.04) , and at D7 ( p < 0.0001). Between-group effect sizes increased from D1 to D7 ( D1: Cohen 's d = 0.84; D2: Cohen 's d = 0.84; D7: Cohen 's d = 1.49). Response rates were high for both groups at D1 and D2 , and significantly higher in the ayahuasca group at D7 ( 64 % v. 27 %; p = 0.04). Remission rate showed a trend toward significance at D7 ( 36 % v. 7 % , p = 0.054). To our knowledge , this is the first controlled trial to test a psychedelic substance in treatment-resistant depression<symptom> Overall , this study brings new evidence supporting the safety and therapeutic value of ayahuasca , dosed within an appropriate setting , to help treat depression<symptom> This study is registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT02914769).
