  We compared renal perfusion in normal pregnant women and women with pre-eclampsia using three-dimensional ( 3D) ultrasound. We measured the flow index ( FI) , vascular index ( VI) and vascularisation flow index ( VFI) which are believed to reflect vascularity and flow intensity. Fourteen patients with normal pregnancy and 16 patients with pre-eclampsia were recruited. Imaging was conducted using a Voluson E8 machine and a 6-MHz trans-abdominal probe. The inferior border of the maternal left kidney was scanned. Volumes were acquired using 3D power Doppler angiography ( 3D-PDA). The FI , VI and VFI were generated using ` histogram ' facility. Maternal characteristics between normal pregnant women and women with pre-eclampsia were not different in terms of maternal age , gestation or body mass index. Depth of insonnation was not different between groups. The FI , VI and the VFI were not different between groups. The mean ( SD) for FI was 27.9 ( 7.4) vs. 27.1 ( 6.5) between women with normal pregnancy vs. women with pre-eclampsia. For VI , mean ( SD) was 72.3 ( 31.6) vs. 79.4 ( 28.7) respectively. For VFI , mean ( SD) was 20.8 ( 10.8) vs. 20.8 ( 8.1) respectively. Using the Mann-Whitney U test , no statistical differences between groups were apparent. There was no correlation between FI measurements and maternal creatinine ( Pearson 's R square = 0.04; p = 0.45) or with maternal urea levels ( Pearson 's R square = 0.20; p = 0.10). Using 3D ultrasound , we failed to demonstrate a difference in maternal renal perfusion in normal pregnancy compared to pre-eclampsia. The lack of observed difference may be a reflection of the high variability in 3D measurements ( i.e. poor investigative tool) rather than a true lack of difference in renal perfusion.
