  The magnetorheological ( MR) elastomer as a hard and soft hybrid functional material , a composite material consisting of magnetic hard particles embedded in elastomeric soft matrix , is a branch of MR materials that are functional smart materials rapidly responding to external magnetic fields. These tunable properties of MR elastomers facilitate a variety of applications. In this brief review paper , in addition to general information on the MR elastomers , recent research not only on a wide variety of MR elastomeric systems focusing on various magnetic particles , elastomeric matrices , additives and particle modification methods , but also on their characteristics including MR properties from dynamic oscillation tests is covered along with their mechanical properties such as the Payne effect , tensile strength and engineering applications.
