  The discovery of acyclovir and penciclovir has led to the development of a successful systemic therapy for treating herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus infection and varicella-zoster virus infection , and the orally available prodrugs , valacyclovir and famciclovir , have improved antiviral treatment compliance. Acyclovir and penciclovir are phosphorylated by viral thymidine kinase and are incorporated into the DNA chain by viral DNA polymerase , resulting in chain termination. Helicase-primase plays an initial step in DNA synthesis to separate the double strand into two single strands ( replication fork) and is a new target of antiviral therapy. The helicase-primase inhibitors ( HPIs) pritelivir and amenamevir have novel mechanisms of action , drug resistance properties , pharmacokinetic characteristics , and clinical efficacy for treating genital<disease> herpes<disease> The clinical study of amenamevir in herpes<disease> zoster<disease> has been completed , and amenamevir has been submitted for approval for treating herpes<disease> zoster<disease> in Japan. The clinical use of HPIs will be the beginning of a new era of anti-herpes therapy.
