  To provide a preliminary investigation into the impact of brief online acceptance-based vs. control-based techniques to self-manage food cravings in women. Female participants ( N = 151) were randomised to ` acceptance ' or ` control ' groups. Measures of general food cravings ( primary outcome) , and depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> and stress ( secondary outcomes) were taken at baseline , two weeks and four weeks. Linear mixed models showed a significant group Ã— time interaction , with food cravings significantly reduced in the thought-control group compared to the acceptance group over four weeks , along with a reduction in food consumption. Levels of depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> and stress decreased over the course of the study , but did not differ by group. These findings provide preliminary support for the acceptability of a minimal technique to self-manage food cravings without deleterious effects , and suggest that simple control-based techniques may be useful in non-clinical , real-world settings.
