  Pre-mRNA splicing is accomplished by the spliceosome , a megadalton complex that assembles de novo on each intron. Because spliceosome assembly and catalysis occur cotranscriptionally , we hypothesized that introns are removed in the order of their transcription in genomes dominated by constitutive splicing. Remarkably little is known about splicing order and the regulatory potential of nascent transcript remodeling by splicing , due to the limitations of existing methods that focus on analysis of mature splicing products ( mRNAs) rather than substrates and intermediates. Here , we overcome this obstacle through long-read RNA sequencing of nascent , multi-intron transcripts in the fission yeast
