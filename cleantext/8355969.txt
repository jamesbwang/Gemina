  The aim of the study was to establish a standardized quantitative evaluation of corneal temperature ( CT) that includes anchoring reference points in the topography and minimization of artifacts. We further investigated the distribution and the short- and long-term reproducibility of the CT values , as well as the influence of the core temperatures. The CT values in both eyes of 40 healthy subjects were measured through thermography. These examinations took place over the course of four visits within 2 consecutive weeks. At each visit , the CTs were measured twice in both eyes with intervals of 15 minutes between measurements. CT values were not significantly different between the right and left eyes and their distribution was nearly normal. The CTs increased slightly when measured twice over the 15-minute intervals ( short-term reproducibility) but remained stable over a period of 2 weeks ( long-term reproducibility). In addition , the CT values depended on the core temperatures. Ocular surface thermography is a fast and noninvasive examination. The methods of optimized and standardized evaluation of the CT values facilitate comparisons and follow-ups. Thermography can be used clinically and scientifically only if both the measurement and its evaluation are efficient and standardized and if the outcomes are highly reproducible.
