  Physical and psychological functional conditions are key factors in the elderly population. Many evaluation tools are available , but they can not be applied to the whole geriatric population. The use Alusti Test is presented. This test consists of 2versions , which enable it to encompass this wide and complex population spectrum. A prospective study with the institutionalised , hospitalised , and community population , was conducted between September and December 2016. A comparative analysis was conducted using the Barthel Index ( BI) , Gait Speed Test ( GST) , Timed `` Up & Go '' Test ( TUG) , Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB) , and Tinetti Test. A total of 363 subjects were enrolled ( mean age: 83.25 years) , with varying levels of functional and cognitive conditions. The test was simple and quick to apply ( 3-6min) , 100 % applicable and usable with broad floor and ceiling effects ( 0-100 points) with an intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC) that shows a high inter-observer reliability ( ICC = 0.99) , and a good correlation in its full version with BI ( ICC = 0.86) ( 95 % CI: 0.82-0.88) , and the Tinetti test ( ICC = 0.76; 95 % CI: 0.71-0.81) , as well as in the abbreviated version BI ( ICC = 0.71; 95 % CI: 0.65-0.75) and Tinetti Test ( ICC = 0.90; 95 % CI: 0.88-0.92). This allows the variation of the functional condition to be measured , which in our sample showed an increase of 10.9 % , after a period of hospital admission. It is considered that Alusti test meets the requirements for physical performance assessment in the whole the geriatric population. The highest level of accuracy is given by the Tinetti test , which has greater applicability.
