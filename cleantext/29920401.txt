  Isotachioside ( 1) and its related natural product 2 are isolated from Isotachis japonica<pathogen> and Protea neriifolia , respectively , and are categorized as analogs of arbutin ( 3) , a tyrosinase inhibitor for practical use. Both of the natural products and several derivatives such as glucoside 4 , xyloside 5 , cellobioside 6 , and maltoside 7 were synthesized via Schmidt glycosylation as a key step , and their tyrosinase inhibitory activity was evaluated. The half maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC
