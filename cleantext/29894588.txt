  In patients with peripheral artery disease , high on-treatment platelet reactivity ( HoTPR) might be associated with worse outcomes for those taking clopidogrel , but not for those taking aspirin. Certain genetic polymorphisms might account for HoTPR. Current literature supports the importance of antiplatelet therapy in treating patients with PAD with clopidogrel , aspirin , or both.
