  To investigate effects of benzo ( a) pyrene ( BaP) on expressions of insulin-degrading enzyme ( IDE) and neprilysin ( NEP) which have the ability to degrade β-amyloid ( Aβ) in neuroglia cells. Primary mix-neuroglia cells were cultured from newborn SD rats. After exposure to BaP , Aβ The cell survival rate showed no significant differences after treatment with BaP ( ≤ 20.00 μmol/L) , Aβ On the premise of no significant change of cell survival rate , BaP pretreatment inhibited the up-regulated expressions of IDE in primary mixed neuroglia cells under cotreatment with Aβ oligomer , indicating that BaP may disturb degradation of Aβ oligomer and cause deposition of β-amyloid and further induce cognitive decline and acceleration of Alzheimer.
