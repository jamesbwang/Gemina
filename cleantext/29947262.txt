  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD) plays a key function in various biochemical processes as they produce reducing power of the cell. Thus , metabolic reprogramming of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide homeostasis is reported to be an important step in cancer progression as well as in combinational therapeutic approaches. In this study , the effects of the antibiotics , furosemide , cefazolin , cefuroxime , gentamicin and clindamycin on rat erythrocyte G6PD enzyme was studied in in vitro conditions. The enzyme was purified by 2 ' , 5 '- adenosine diphosphate Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography in a single purification step with 1825 fold and 83.7 % yield. The specific activity of the enzyme was 29.2 EU/mg proteins. The inhibition studies of these antibiotics were carried out on the enzyme revealing that gentamicin , clindamycin and furosemide inhibited the activity of the G6PD with an IC
