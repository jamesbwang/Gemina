  To determine if second trimester mean platelet volume ( MPV) and serum uric acid are reasonable predictors of preeclampsia ( PE) or not , in patients at moderate and low risk. This prospective study was conducted on 9522 women at low or moderate risk for developing PE who underwent dual measurements of MPV and serum uric acid at late first trimester ( 10-12 weeks) and at second trimester ( 18-20 weeks) and subsequently divided into two groups; PE group ( n = 286) who later developed PE and non-PE group ( n = 9236). Test validity of MPV and serum uric acid was the primary outcome measure. Data were collected and analyzed. Second trimester MPV is a good predictor for development of PE at a cutoff value of 9.55 fL with area under the curve ( AUC) of 0.86 , sensitivity of 95.2 % , specificity of 66.7 % , positive predictive value ( PPV) of 87 % , negative predictive value ( NPV) of 85.7 % , and accuracy of 86.7 %. Second trimester serum uric acid is a good predictor for development of PE at a cutoff value of 7.35 mg/dL , with AUC of 0.85 , sensitivity of 95.2 % , specificity of 55.6 % , PPV of 83.3 % , NPV of 83.3 % , and accuracy of 83.3 %. Combination of both tests has a sensitivity of 100 % , specificity of 22.2 % , PPV of 75 % , NPV of 100 % , and accuracy of 76.7 %. Second trimester MPV and serum uric acid alone or in combination could be used as a useful biochemical markers for prediction of PE based on their validity , simplicity , and availability.
