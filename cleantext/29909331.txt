  Influence of sediment particle size on the desorption , bioavailability , and bioaccumulation potential of cypermethrin was investigated in the present study using two biomimetic techniques ( Tenax extraction and solid-phase microextraction ( SPME)) and bioaccumulation testing with Lumbriculus variegatus. A field-collected sediment was wet sieved to obtain five particle-size fractions ( < 20 , 20-63 , 63-180 , 180-500 , and > 500 μm) and used for cypermethrin spiking. The finest sediment ( < 20 μm) had the highest rapid desorption fraction ( F
