  Cancer cells display differences regarding their engagement of glycolytic vs. mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS) pathway. Triple negative breast cancer , an aggressive form of breast cancer , is characterized by elevated glycolysis , while estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells rely predominantly on OXPHOS. BCL2 proteins control the process of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization during apoptosis , but also regulate cellular bioenergetics. Because BCL2 proteins are overexpressed in breast cancer and targetable by selective antagonists , we here analysed the effect of BCL2 and BCL ( X) L selective inhibitors , Venetoclax and WEHI-539 , on mitochondrial bioenergetics and cell death. Employing single cell imaging using a FRET-based mitochondrial ATP sensor , we found that MCF7 breast cancer cells supplied with mitochondrial substrates reduced their mitochondrial ATP production when treated with Venetoclax or WEHI-539 at concentrations that
