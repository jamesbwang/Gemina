  One of the major causes of lumbar spinal canal stenosis ( LSCS) has been considered facet joint hypertrophy ( FJH). However , a previous study asserted that `` FJH '' is a misnomer because common facet joints are no smaller than degenerative facet joints; however , this hypothesis has not been effectively demonstrated. Therefore , in order to verify that FJH is a misnomer in patients with LSCS , we devised new morphological parameters that we called facet joint thickness ( FJT) and facet joint cross-sectional area ( FJA). We collected FJT and FJA data from 114 patients with LSCS. A total of 86 control subjects underwent lumbar magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) as part of routine medical examinations , and axial T2-weighted MRI images were obtained from all participants. We measured FJT by drawing a line along the facet area and then measuring the narrowest point at L4-L5. We measured FJA as the whole cross-sectional area of the facet joint at the stenotic L4-L5 level.The average FJT was 1.60 ± 0.36 mm in the control group and 1.11 ± 0.32 mm in the LSCS group. The average FJA was 14.46 ± 5.17 mm in the control group and 9.31 ± 3.47 mm in the LSCS group. Patients with LSCS had significantly lower FJTs ( P < .001) and FJAs ( P < .001). FJH , a misnomer , should be renamed facet joint area narrowing. Using this terminology would eliminate confusion<symptom> in descriptions of the facet joint.
