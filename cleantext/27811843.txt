  Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament ( OPLL) presents as pathological heterotopic ossification of the spinal ligaments. However , its underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. Our previous findings suggested that altered microRNA regulatory network are critical for the development of OPLL. Here , we set out to unveiling the detailed mechanism of those altered OPLL-specific microRNAs. We screened a set of differentially expressed OPLL-specific microRNAs from the previous sequencing data and showed that microRNA-10a actively modulates the ossification of posterior ligament cells in vitro. Using a tissue-engineered scaffold grown from 4-week-old BALB/c homozygous nude mice , we found that altered microRNA-10a expression in posterior ligament cells indeed affected the heterotopic bone formation in vivo. Furthermore , computational analysis showed that the negative ossification regulator ID3 is a functional target gene of microRNA-10a , and its expression was also significantly altered during microRNA-10a modulation both in vitro and in vivo. Also , we have demonstrated that the ossification promoting function of microRNA-10a requires ID3 , as ID3 actively inhibits RUNX2. Thus , we identified a critical role for highly altered OPLL-specific microRNA-10a in regulating the development of OPLL by modulating the ID3/RUNX2 axis.
