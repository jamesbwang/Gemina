  Previous studies have shown that French-speaking family physicians ( FSPs) in Ontario are less numerous in areas with high proportions of francophones. The purpose of the current study was to assess whether the degree of concordance between physicians ' language of competence and the linguistic profile of the community in which they practise is associated with workload and to explore variations in this relation in rural and northern regions of the province. This was a secondary analysis of the 2013 College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario Annual Membership Renewal Survey. We analyzed the primary practice location and language of competence of family physicians/general practitioners. We compared the practice characteristics of FSPs and non-French-speaking physicians ( NFSPs) by the proportion of the francophone population , geographic location ( north vs. south) and community size ( urban vs. rural). Data for 10 548 family physician/general practitioners were analyzed. In areas densely populated by francophones , FSPs worked more hours per week on average and had a greater mean number of patient visits than NFSPs. Non-French-speaking physicians working in areas densely populated by francophones had fewer patient visits per hour on average than FSPs. In most cases , the results were particularly accentuated in rural and northern communities. Our findings suggest that , compared to NFSPs , the demands placed on FSPs are disproportionately greater in communities where the need for French-language health care services is greatest and the supply of FSPs is the smallest. Our results underline the importance of properly preparing family physicians to work in areas densely populated by francophones.
