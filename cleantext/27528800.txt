  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzymopathy worldwide. Primaquine is the only licensed drug that effectively removes Plasmodium<pathogen> vivax<pathogen> hypnozoites from the human host and prevents relapse. While well tolerated by most recipients , primaquine can cause haemolysis in G6PD deficient individuals and is , therefore , underused. Rapid diagnostic tests ( RDTs) could permit ascertainment of G6PD status outside of laboratory settings and hence safe treatment in remote areas. The performance of the fluorescent spot test ( Trinity , Ireland; FST) and a G6PD RDT ( Carestart , USA) against spectrophotometry were assessed. Participants were enrolled during cross-sectional surveys in Laos and by purposive sampling in Cambodia. FST and RDT were performed during village surveys and 3 mL of venous blood was collected for subsequent G6PD measurement by spectrophotometry. A total of 757 participants were enrolled in Laos and 505 in Cambodia. FST and RDT performed best at 30 % cut-off activity and performed significantly better in Laos than in Cambodia. When defining intermediate results as G6PD deficient , the FST had a sensitivity of 100 % ( 95 % CI 90-100) and specificity of 90 % ( 95 % CI 87.7-92.2) in Laos and sensitivity of 98 % ( 94.1-99.6) and specificity of 71 % ( 95 % CI 66-76) in Cambodia ( p < 0.001). The RDT had sensitivity and specificity of 100 % ( 95 % CI 90-100) and 99 % ( 95 % CI 97-99) in Laos and sensitivity and specificity of 91 % ( 86-96) and 93 % ( 90-95) in Cambodia ( p < 0.001). The RDT performed significantly better ( all p < 0.05) than the FST when intermediate FST results were defined as G6PD deficient. The interpretation of RDT results requires some training but is a good alternative to the FST.
