  A cost-effective approach to gather information in a smart city is to embed sensors in vehicles such as buses. To understand the limitations and opportunities of this model , it is fundamental to investigate the spatial coverage of such a network , especially in the case where only a subset of the buses have a sensing device embedded. In this paper , we propose a model to select the right subset of buses that maximizes the coverage of the city. We evaluate the model in a real scenario based on a large-scale dataset of more than 5700 buses in the city of Rio de Janeiro , Brazil. Among other findings , we observe that the fleet of buses covers approximately 5655 km of streets ( approximately 47 % of the streets) and show that it is possible to cover 94 % of the same streets if only 18 % of buses have sensing capabilities embedded.
