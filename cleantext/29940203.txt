  Toluene diisocyanate ( TDI) is a reactive chemical used in manufacturing plastics. TDI exposure adversely affects workers ' health , causing occupational asthma , but individuals differ in susceptibility. We recently suggested a role for signalling mediated by the enzyme autotaxin ( ATX) and its product , lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA) , in TDI toxicity. Here we genotyped 118 TDI-exposed workers for six single-nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) in genes encoding proteins implicated in ATX-LPA signalling: purinergic receptor P2X7 ( P2RX7) , CC motif chemokine ligand 2 ( CCL2) , interleukin 1β ( IL1B) , and caveolin 1 ( CAV1). Two P2RX7 SNPs ( rs208294 and rs2230911) significantly modified the associations between a biomarker of TDI exposure ( urinary 2,4-toluene diamine) and plasma LPA; two IL1B SNPs ( rs16944 and rs1143634) did not. CAV1 rs3807989 modified the associations , but the effect was not statistically significant ( p = 0.05-0.09). In vitro , TDI-exposed bronchial epithelial cells ( 16HBE14o-) rapidly released ATX and IL-1β. P2X7 inhibitors attenuated both responses , but confocal microscopy showed non-overlapping localizations of ATX and IL-1β , and down-regulation of CAV1 inhibited the ATX response but not the IL-1β response. This study indicates that P2X7 is pivotal for TDI-induced ATX-LPA signalling , which was modified by genetic variation in P2RX7. Furthermore , our data suggest that the TDI-induced ATX and IL-1β responses occur independently.
