  Soil alkalinity greatly affects plant growth and crop productivity. Although RNA-Seq analyses have been conducted to investigate genome-wide gene expression in response to alkaline stress in many plants , the expressions of alkali-responsive genes in rice have not been previously investigated. In this study , the transcriptomic data between an alkaline-tolerant ( WD20342) and an alkaline-sensitive ( Caidao) rice cultivar were compared under alkaline stress conditions. A total of 962 important alkali-responsive ( IAR) genes from highly differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) were identified , including 28 alkaline-resistant cultivar-related genes , 771 alkaline-sensitive cultivar-related genes and 163 cultivar-non-specific genes. Gene ontology ( GO) analysis indicated the enrichment of IAR genes involved in various stimulus or stress responses. According to Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG) pathway analysis , the IAR genes were related primarily to plant hormone signal transduction and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Additionally , among these 962 IAR genes , 74 were transcription factors and 15 occurred with differential alternative splicing between the different samples after alkaline treatment. Our results provide a valuable resource on alkali-responsive genes and should benefit the improvement of alkaline stress tolerance in rice.
