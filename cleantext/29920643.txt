  The microbiome is represented by microorganisms which live in a symbiotic way with the mammalian. The microorganisms have the ability to influence different physiological aspects such as the immune system , metabolism and behaviour. In the last years , several studies have highlighted the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Notably , in systemic lupus erythematosus an alteration of the intestinal flora ( lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio) was described. On the other hand , changes to the gut commensal and periodontal<disease> disease<disease> were proposed as important factors to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis<disease>. At the same time , other autoimmune diseases ( i.e. systemic sclerosis , Sjogren 's syndrome<disease> and antiphospholipid syndrome<disease>) shared modifications of the microbiome in the intestinal tract and oral flora as well. Herein , we describe the role of the microbiome in the maintenance homeostasis of the immune system and then the alterations of the microorganism that occur in systemic autoimmune diseases. Finally , we will consider the use of probiotics and fecal transplantation as a novel therapeutic targets. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
