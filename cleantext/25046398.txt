  Pachychoroid disease spectrum has garnered considerable interest and has been discussed in detail in recent literature. It refers to a group of retinal and choroidal disorders , namely pigment epitheliopathy , central serous chorioretinopathy , neovasculopathy , and polypoid choroidal vasculopathy , all arising from a thickened choroid and hyperpermeable large choroidal vessels. We describe a case which had simultaneous presentation of multiple disorders on the pachychoroid spectrum. Multimodal findings in this patient have been described in this report. The presence of pachychoroid should prompt thorough imaging since coexistence of multiple disorders can potentially change the management and follow-up schedule of these patients.
