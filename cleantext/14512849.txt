  Mammalian Sterile20-like ( MST) kinases are located upstream in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway , and play an important role in cell proliferation , differentiation , renewal , polarization and migration. Generally , five MST kinases exist in mammalian signal transduction pathways , including MST1 , MST2 , MST3 , MST4 and YSK1. The central nervous system ( CNS) is a sophisticated entity that takes charge of information reception , integration and response. Recently , accumulating evidence proposes that MST kinases are critical in the development of disease in different systems involving the CNS. In this review , we summarized the signal transduction pathways and interacting proteins of MST kinases. The potential biological function of each MST kinase and the commonly reported MST-related diseases in the neural system are also reviewed. Further investigation of MST kinases and their interaction with CNS diseases would provide the medical community with new therapeutic targets for
