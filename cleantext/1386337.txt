  Pancreatic tissue , and islets in particular , are enriched in expression of the interleukin-1 receptor type I ( IL-1R). Because of this enrichment , islet β-cells are exquisitely sensitive to the IL-1R ligands IL-1α and IL-1β , suggesting that signaling through this pathway regulates health and function of islet β-cells. Herein , we report a targeted deletion of IL-1R in pancreatic tissue ( IL-1R Pancreatic deletion of IL-1R leads to impaired glucose tolerance , a phenotype that is exacerbated by age. Crossing the IL-1R There is an important physiological role for pancreatic IL-1R to promote glucose homeostasis by suppressing expression of Aldh1a3 , sustaining MafA abundance , and supporting glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vivo.
