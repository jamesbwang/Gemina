  Scorpion venom is the most expensive and deadly venom with exciting medical prospects and having a potential as a source of drug candidates. A number of scorpion venom peptides have shown promising site specificity and are involved in the regulation of biological mechanisms. Due to the structural and functional specificity , the scorpion peptides are widely used for the development of specific drugs especially for the cardiovascular and other immune diseases. In this review , we summarize scorpion venom 's biological activities such as antimicrobial , antiviral , anti-cancerous and in immune diseases. Evolutionary perspective of peptides derived from different scorpion venoms are also described in this review. The most significant venom peptides are; Ctriporin , Chlorotoxins ( cltx) , Neopladine I and II , Meucin 24 , Meucin 25 and Hp 1090. The most recognized scorpion species with pharmaceutical activities are; Pandinus imperator , Chaerilustricostatus , Buthus martensii , Mesobuthus eupeus , Leiurus quinnquestriatus , Tityus discrepans and Heterometrus bengalensis. The role of peptides in cardiovascular events and in treating osteoporosis signifies their importance. The role of peptides against pathogens , skin<disease> infections<disease> , pain-relieving effects , anti-malarial and anti-viral effects are discussed in detail. We further , summarized the classification of scorpion peptides among different toxins , their evolutionary process and the pattern of scorpion venom resource analysis.
