  The development of visible-light-induced synthesis of functionalized pyrroloindolines via a radical cascade reaction is reported. The reaction shows a broad substrate scope and highlights the mild nature of the reaction conditions. A range of substitutions on indole aromatic rings and N-centers is well tolerated , including a free allylic alcohol. Relying on the strategy , a rapid synthesis of ( Â±)- flustraminol B was achieved.
