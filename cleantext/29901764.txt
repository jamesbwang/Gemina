  To evaluate the significant role played by biofilms during prosthetic vascular material infections ( PVMIs). We developed an in vivo mouse model of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> PVMI allowing its direct observation by confocal microscopy to describe: ( i) the structure of biofilms developed on Dacron Â® vascular material; ( ii) the localization and effect of antibiotics on these biostructures; and ( iii) the interaction between bacteria and host tissues and cells during PVMI. In this model we demonstrated that the biofilm structures are correlated to the activity of antibiotics. Furthermore , live S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> bacteria were visualized inside the macrophages present at the biofilm sites , which is significant as antibiotics do not penetrate these immune cells. This intracellular situation may explain the limited effect of antibiotics and also why PVMIs can relapse after antibiotic therapy.
