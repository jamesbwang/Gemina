  With the knowledge of psychoneuroimmunological responses and the known high stress levels of nursing students , as caring nurse educators , we have become ethically obligated to revise and re-vision our current nursing educational practices. Nurse educators should be motivated to create innovative and radical caring science curricular approaches , so that our nurses of the future are in turn supported in creating caring- healing sustainable bedside practices. This paper details the outcomes from an upper level yoga elective in an RN- BSN program. The course is just one within an innovative holistic-integral nursing curriculum that supports nurses in practicing self-care as a way to support their ability to create caring-healing moments and spaces for patients , implement change in the workplace , and avoid the perils of burn-out related to low stress resilience , which is so common within the nursing profession.
