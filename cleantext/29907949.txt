  In contrast to information on the effects of organophosphate , pesticide , or environmental exposures , data on cholinergic crisis caused by pharmaceutical cholinesterase inhibitors are sparse. The present study aimed to describe the characteristics , demographics , and mortality of patients with cholinergic crisis caused by pharmaceutical cholinesterase inhibitors using a nationwide inpatient database in Japan. We identified patients diagnosed with cholinergic crisis as a result of taking cholinesterase inhibitor medications in the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination inpatient database from July 2010 to March 2016. We examined the patients ' characteristics , treatments , and mortality. A total of 235 patients with cholinergic crisis were identified during the 69-month study period. Forty-eight patients required mechanical ventilation ( 20.4 %) , and 15 patients died ( 6.4 %) in hospital. The median lengths of hospital stay and intensive care unit stay were 15 days ( interquartile range , 6-42) and 4 days ( 2-8) , respectively. Approximately half of all hospitalized patients required catecholamines , atropine , or mechanical ventilation , while the other half did not require any of these treatments. Patients who required catecholamines , atropine , or mechanical ventilation were more likely to die and had longer hospital stays. Cholinergic crisis caused by pharmaceutical cholinesterase inhibitors is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. Patients who require mechanical ventilation and catecholamines or atropine have a poorer prognosis.
