  The objectives of this study were to assess and validate previously published prediction models with an independent dataset and to expose the power and limitations of linear regression models for predicting biomethane potential. Two datasets were used for the validation , one with all individual samples and one with the average values of each cultivar. The results revealed similar performances of all four models for the individual samples. The methane yields of the cultivars were predicted more accurately than the methane yields of the individual samples. The grassland specific model predicted the variation in the dataset with an R
