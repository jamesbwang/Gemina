  Glioblastoma ranks among the most lethal cancers with current therapies offering only palliation. Paracrine vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) signaling has been targeted using anti-angiogenic agents , whereas autocrine VEGF/VEGF Receptor 2 ( VEGFR2) signaling is poorly understood. Bevacizumab resistance of VEGFR2-expressing glioblastoma cells prompted interrogation of autocrine VEGF-C-VEGFR2 signaling in glioblastoma. Autocrine VEGF-C/VEGFR2 signaling was functionally investigated using RNA interference and exogenous ligands in patient-derived xenograft lines and primary glioblastoma cell cultures in vitro and in vivo. VEGF-C expression and interaction with VEGFR2 in a matched pre- and post-bevacizumab treatment cohort were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and proximity ligation assay. VEGF-C was expressed by patient-derived xenograft glioblastoma lines , primary cells and matched surgical specimens before and after bevacizumab treatment. VEGF-C activated autocrine VEGFR2 signaling to promote cell survival , whereas targeting VEGF-C expression reprogrammed cellular transcription to attenuate survival and cell cycle progression. Supporting potential translational significance , targeting VEGF-C impaired tumor growth in vivo , with superiority to bevacizumab treatment. Our results demonstrate VEGF-C serves as both a paracrine and autocrine pro-survival cytokine in glioblastoma , promoting tumor cell survival and tumorigenesis. VEGF-C permits sustained VEGFR2 activation and tumor growth , where its inhibition appears superior to bevacizumab therapy in improving tumor control.
