  The adsorption behavior of CO on Ni islands grown on Au ( 111) was studied with a combination of temperature programmed desorption , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy , and surface resistivity measurements. The Au ( 111) herringbone reconstruction provides a template for the growth of ordered Ni islands , with evidence for the presence of strain and Au atoms within the islands. The islands grow radially until Î¸
