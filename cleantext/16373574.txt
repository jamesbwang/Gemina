  Argonaute ( AGO) proteins partner with microRNAs ( miRNAs) to target specific genes for post-transcriptional regulation. During larval development in Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> , Argonaute-Like Gene 1 ( ALG-1) is the primary mediator of the miRNA pathway , while the related ALG-2 protein is largely dispensable. Here we show that in adult C. elegans<pathogen> these AGOs are differentially expressed and , surprisingly , work in opposition to each other; alg-1 promotes longevity , whereas alg-2 restricts lifespan. Transcriptional profiling of adult animals revealed that distinct miRNAs and largely non-overlapping sets of protein-coding genes are misregulated in alg-1 and alg-2 mutants. Interestingly , many of the differentially expressed genes are downstream targets of the Insulin/ IGF-1 Signaling ( IIS) pathway , which controls lifespan by regulating the activity of the DAF-16/ FOXO transcription factor. Consistent with this observation , we show that daf-16 is required for the extended lifespan of alg-2 mutants. Furthermore , the long lifespan of daf-2 insulin receptor mutants , which depends on daf-16 , is strongly reduced in animals lacking alg-1 activity. This work establishes an important role for AGO-mediated gene regulation in aging C. elegans<pathogen> and illustrates that the activity of homologous genes can switch from complementary to antagonistic , depending on the life stage.
