  Pembrolizumab is the only programmed cell death 1/programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor for treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer , with a companion diagnostic assay , the 22C3 PharmDx. Although in many studies 22C3 and Ventana 's SP263 appear to yield overlapping results , they show discrepancies at clinically relevant cutoffs ( 1 % and 50 %). We provide a solid comparison between 22C3 and SP263 assays in a large cohort of non-small cell lung cancer cases taking into account interobserver variability between trained pathologists who are used to either clone in their clinical practice. Serial sections of tissue microarrays , built from 198 cases of resected lung cancer , were stained for 22C3 on the Dako Link-48 platform and for SP263 on the Ventana Benchmark Ultra , following manufacturer 's instructions. A protocol was also developed to run the 22C3 antibody on the Ventana platform. The pathologist used to 22C3 scored consistently higher than the pathologist used to SP263 at both 1 % and 50 % cutoff for all assays. For 22C3 and SP263 on respective platforms , we found statistically significant differences in terms of proportion of positive cases at both cutoffs; at 50 % cutoff , around half of the cases positive with SP263 would have been defined negative with 22C3 by both pathologists. Important differences were also observed , when comparing clone 22C3 and SP263 , both run on the Ventana platform. The lowest differences were seen with 22C3 run on both platforms. Assays 22C3 and SP263 show important discrepancies in identifying programmed death-ligand 1-positive cases at clinically relevant cutoffs , with possible underestimation of patients suitable for pembrolizumab therapy.
