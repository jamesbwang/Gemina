  Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( ZIKV) has recently caused explosive outbreaks in Pacific islands , South- and Central America. Like with other flaviviruses , protective immunity is strongly dependent on potently neutralizing antibodies ( Abs) directed against the viral envelope protein E. Such Ab formation is promoted by CD4 T cells through direct interaction with B cells that present epitopes derived from E or other structural proteins of the virus. Here , we examined the extent and epitope dominance of CD4 T cell responses to capsid ( C) and envelope proteins in Zika patients. All patients developed ZIKV-specific CD4 T cell responses , with substantial contributions of C and E. In both proteins , immunodominant epitopes clustered at sites that are structurally conserved among flaviviruses but have highly variable sequences , suggesting a strong impact of protein structural features on immunodominant CD4 T cell responses. Our data are particularly relevant for designing flavivirus<pathogen> vaccines and their evaluation in T cell assays and provide insights into the importance of viral protein structure for epitope selection and antigenicity.
