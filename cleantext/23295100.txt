  The complexity of vitamin D metabolites especially the contribution of C3-epimers of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( C3-epimers) in human sera remains unclear. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D-related gene pathway contribute to variation in C3-epimer levels. Therefore , we investigated candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) concerning C3-epimer levels. The candidate SNPs , including Among the participants , the median ( range) levels of non-C3-epimers and C3-epimers were 22.7 ( 6.4-49.2) ng/mL and 1.3 ( 0.01-14.2) ng/mL , respectively. In regression analysis , we found the genetic variation of two SNPs , the To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to demonstrate genetic models concerning the variation in C3-epimer levels. Our results emphasize that genetic determinants and the potential factors of C3-epimers differ from non-C3-epimers. This study contributes fundamental knowledge of the endogenous vitamin D pathway.
