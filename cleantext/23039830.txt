  A sandwich-type electrochemical cytosensor is described for quantitative determination of CD44-overexpressing HeLa cells. Hyaluronic acid ( HA) acts as a targeting molecule that was in-situ incorporated into the sensor based on the use of an indium tin oxide ( ITO) electrode modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs). The 3D-MWCNT structure is shown to strongly improve the electronic properties and surface chemical reactivities. The HA-modified sensor exhibits a highly sensitive response to HeLa cells. A sandwiched hybridization protocol was then established using BIO ( an N-butyl-4- ( 6 '- aminohexyl) amino-1,8-naphthalimide probe modified with HA) as the tracing labels of the fluorescent probes for targeting CD44-positive tumor cells. The signal amplification was thereby maximized and measured by chronocoulometry. The binding of CD44-positive HeLa cells to the HA modified sensing layer causes a decrease in chronocoulometric response. The signal decreases linearly in the 2.1 Ã— 10
