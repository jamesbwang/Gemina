  This Review focuses on the original papers that have made a difference to our thinking and were first in describing an adaptation to diving , and less on those that later repeated the findings with better equipment. It describes some important anatomical peculiarities of phocid seals , as well as their many physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> to diving. In so doing , it is argued that the persistent discussions on the relevance and differences between responses seen in forced dives in the laboratory and those during free diving in the wild are futile. In fact , both are two sides of the same coin , aimed at protecting the body against asphyxic insult and extending diving performance.
