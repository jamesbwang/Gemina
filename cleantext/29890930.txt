  Establishing understanding of infants ' dietary intakes can support interventions to improve their diets and overall health. Because information on the dietary intakes of infants aged â‰¤ 12 months in Saudi Arabia is scarce , this study examined the diets of infants aged 6 and 12 months in Saudi Arabia and determined their main dietary sources of total energy and macronutrients. A crosssectional dietary survey employing a single 24-hour recall was performed between May and December 2015 with a sample of mothers of 278 healthy 6-month-old and 259 12-month-old infants. An analysis of the dietary intake data determined the nutrient intake adequacy and the percentage contributions of foods to energy and macronutrient intakes. The respective mean daily energy intakes of the 6-month-old and 12-month-old infants in the study were 703 kcal and 929 kcal. Both age groups recorded adequate nutrient intakes , with the exception that the 6-month-olds ' mean vitamin D intake fell below the recommended Adequate Intake ( AI) , and the 12-month-olds ' intakes of omega-6 fatty acids and vitamin D were also below the AI , along with their iron intake which fell short of the Recommended Dietary Allowance ( RDA). The data generated here will assist health professionals in planning interventions which aim to improve infants ' diets and to offer guidance to parents on the appropriate selection of food for their infants.
