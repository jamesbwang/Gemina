  Men and women with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) have higher risk of hip fracture , but the mechanisms are not fully understood. We aimed to investigate how T2DM , glucose , and insulin were associated with femoral bone mineral density ( BMD) , bone mineral area ( BMA) , and bone turnover markers. We used two cross-sectional cohorts: the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men ( ULSAM , n = 452 , mean age 82 years) and the Swedish Mammography Cohort Clinical ( SMCC , n = 4713 , mean age 68 years). We identified men and women with normal fasting glucose ( NFG) , impaired fasting plasma glucose ( IFG) , and T2DM. BMD and BMA at the total hip and femoral shaft were measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA). Bone turnover markers; CrossLaps and osteocalcin were measured in women. Linear regression models were applied. Men and women showed a progressively higher BMD following the clinical cutoffs of fasting glucose from NFG to IFG to T2DM. In contrast , there was a progressively lower BMA. Men and women with T2DM , compared to those with NFG , had lower BMA at the total hip (- 1.7 %; 95 % CI- 3.2 ,- 0.2 and- 1.0 %; 95 % CI- 1.6 ,- 0.4) and the femoral shaft (- 2.0 %; 95 % CI- 3.5 ,- 0.4 and- 0.6 %; 95 % CI- 1.2 ,- 0.01) , respectively. T2DM was associated with lower concentrations of CrossLaps (- 8.1 %; 95 % CI- 12.7 ,- 3.6) and osteocalcin (- 15.2 %; 95 % CI- 19.0 ,- 11.2). These cross-sectional results indicate that those with T2DM have smaller bone area and lower bone turnover , which could increase the risk of hip fracture.
