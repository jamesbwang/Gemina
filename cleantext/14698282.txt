  We previously reported that activated γδ T cells greatly enhance autoimmune responses , particularly the Th17 response. To determine the mechanisms involved , we made a series of comparisons between activated and non-activated γδ T cells. Our results showed that activated γδ T cells expressed greatly increased levels of A2A adenosine receptor ( A2AR) and decreased amounts of CD73 , as well as increased amounts of T cell activation markers such as CD69 , CD44 and CD25. We show that A2AR is a major functional molecule in the enhancing activity of γδ T cells. A2AR-/- γδ T cells ( isolated from A2AR-/- mouse) , lost their Th17-enhancing activity as did A2AR +/ + γδ T cells ( isolated from wt-B6 mouse) after treatment with an A2AR antagonist. Since γδ T cells possess either an enhancing or an inhibiting effect , we also tested whether A2AR expression on γδ T cells is essential to their inhibiting effect. Our results showed that the inhibiting effect of A2AR-/- γδ T cells was as potent as that of A2AR +/ + γδ T cells. In a previous report we showed that the expression of different levels of CD73 molecule allowed γδ T cells to adjust their suppressive activity; in the current study , we show that expression of increased amounts of A2AR allows γδ T cells to more effectively exert their enhancing function.
