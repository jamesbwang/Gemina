  An important consideration of any computer adaptive testing ( CAT) program is the criterion used for ending item administration-the stopping rule , which ensures that all examinees are assessed to the same standard. Although various stopping rules exist , none of them have been compared under the generalized partial-credit model ( Muraki in Applied Psychological Measurement , 16 , 159-176 , 1992). In this simulation study we compared the performance of three variable-length stopping rules-standard error ( SE) , minimum information ( MI) , and change in theta ( CT)- both in isolation and in combination with requirements of minimum and maximum numbers of items , as well as a fixed-length stopping rule. Each stopping rule was examined under two termination criteria-one a more lenient requirement ( SE = 0.35 , MI = 0.56 , CT = 0.05) , and one more stringent ( SE = 0.30 , MI = 0.42 , CT = 0.02). The simulation design also included content-balancing and exposure controls , aspects of CAT that have been excluded in previous research comparing variable-length stopping rules. The minimum-information stopping rule produced biased theta estimates and varied greatly in measurement quality across the theta distribution. The absolute-change-in-theta stopping rule had strong performance when paired with a lower criterion and a minimum test length. The standard error stopping rule consistently provided the best balance<symptom> of measurement precision and operational efficiency and was based on the fewest number of administered items necessary to obtain accurate and precise theta estimates , particularly when it was paired with a maximum-number-of-items stopping rule.
