  Balancing the tradeoff between radiation dose , acquisition duration and diagnostic image quality is essential for medical imaging modalities involving ionizing radiation. Lower administered activities to the patient can reduce absorbed dose , but can result in reduced diagnostic image quality or require longer acquisition durations. In pediatric nuclear medicine , it is desirable to use the lowest amount of administered radiopharmaceutical activity and the shortest acquisition duration that gives sufficient image quality for clinical diagnosis. However , diagnostic image quality is a complex function of patient factors including body morphometry. In this study , we present a digital population of 90 computational anatomic phantoms that model realistic variations in body morphometry and internal anatomy. These phantoms were used to generate a large database of projection images modeling pediatric SPECT imaging using a
