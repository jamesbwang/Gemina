  Treatment goals in pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH) include improved quality of life and exercise capacity as well as improved life prognosis. In our experience , only remarkable reductions in pulmonary arterial pressure ( PAP) improve long-term survival. Lowering PAP could contribute to reverse remodeling by reducing hemodynamic stress. Proper and prompt use of PAH-specific drugs lowers PAP in patients with PAH. Upfront combination therapy with different PAH-specific drugs and quickly establishing high-dose epoprostenol lowers PAP sufficiently to improve prognosis in patients with PAH. PAH is often a comorbidity with other diseases including congenital heart defect , connective tissue diseases , and pulmonary arterial aneurysm<disease>. It is essential in these conditions to lower PAP to allow the next treatment strategy. In this report , we review modern treatments to lower PAP in patients with PAH.
