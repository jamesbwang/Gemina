  Several Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> deletion mutants of the Keio collection were selected for analysis to better understand which genes may play a key role in copper or silver homeostasis. Each of the selected E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> mutants had a deletion of a single gene predicted to encode proteins for homologous recombination or contained functions directly linked to copper or silver transport or transformation. The survival of these strains on pure copper surfaces , stainless steel , and alloys of aluminum , copper and/or silver was investigated. When exposed to pure copper surfaces , E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ΔcueO was the most sensitive , whereas E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ΔcopA was the most resistant amongst the different strains tested. However , we observed a different trend in sensitivities in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strains upon exposure to alloys of the system Al-Ag-Cu. While minor antimicrobial effects were detected after exposure of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ΔcopA and E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ΔrecA to Al-Ag alloys , no effect was detected after exposure to Al-Cu alloys. The release of copper ions and cell-associated copper ion concentrations were determined for E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ΔcopA and the wild-type E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> after exposure to pure copper surfaces. Altogether , compared to binary alloys , ternary eutectic alloys ( Al-Ag-Cu) had the highest antimicrobial effect and thus , warrant further investigation.
