  This Consensus Document is the first of two reports summarizing the views of an expert panel organized by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions ( EAPCI) on the clinical use of intracoronary imaging including intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS) and optical coherence tomography ( OCT). The first document appraises the role of intracoronary imaging to guide percutaneous coronary interventions ( PCIs) in clinical practice. Current evidence regarding the impact of intracoronary imaging guidance on cardiovascular outcomes is summarized , and patients or lesions<symptom> most likely to derive clinical benefit from an imaging-guided intervention are identified. The relevance of the use of IVUS or OCT prior to PCI for optimizing stent sizing ( stent length and diameter) and planning the procedural strategy is discussed. Regarding post-implantation imaging , the consensus group recommends key parameters that characterize an optimal PCI result and provides cut-offs to guide corrective measures and optimize the stenting result. Moreover , routine performance of intracoronary imaging in patients with stent failure ( restenosis or stent thrombosis) is recommended. Finally , strengths and limitations of IVUS and OCT for guiding PCI and assessing stent failures and areas that warrant further research are critically discussed.
