  To produce a word , speakers need to retrieve the lexico-syntactic representation of the word and encode the phonological form for articulation. It is not precisely known yet if a word 's syntactic features ( e.g. , number , gender , etc.) are automatically activated and selected in bare noun production. Cubelli , Lotto , Paolieri , Girelli , and Job ( 2005) proposed that only in languages that have a complex morphological structure ( e.g. , Italian) , the selection of grammatical gender is required. In languages with a relatively simpler morphological structure , the selection of grammatical gender is by-passed. Here , we investigated this issue further by employing a language with an extremely simple morphological structure , i.e. , Mandarin Chinese. Using the picture-word interference paradigm , we manipulated the congruency of the lexico-syntactic classifier feature ( comparable to grammatical gender) between the target picture and the superimposed distractor word. We measured participants ' naming latencies and their electroencephalogram ( EEG). As a result , relative to the classifier-congruent condition , classifier incongruency elicited a stronger N400 effect in the ERP analyses , suggesting the automatic activation of lexico-syntactic features in bare noun production. However , classifier congruency did not affect naming latencies , suggesting that the lexico-syntactic feature is not selected in bare noun naming when it is irrelevant for production.
