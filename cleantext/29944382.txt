  Enols are used for the first time in a condensation with aldehydes and isocyanides to selectively give three- or pseudo-four-component adducts , depending on the reaction conditions. These new transformations have proven to be a convenient alternative for the synthesis of biologically relevant pyrrolidinones containing peptidic or pseudo-peptidic groups on carbon 3. More importantly , this work attests to the utility of heterocyclic enols containing conjugated electron-withdrawing groups as useful reagents in isocyanide-based multicomponent reactions.
