  Transmembrane cation channels include those for calcium , copper and iron ion transport. Each channel has physiological significance , and all have been associated with disease. However , the comparative study of transcriptional‑translational levels in canine organs has not been previously reported. In the present study , organ‑specific expression of calcium channels , including sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger 3 ( NCKX3) and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 2 ( TRPV2) , copper channels , including high affinity copper uptake protein 1 ( CTR1) and copper‑transporting ATPase 1 ( ATP7A) , and iron channels , including iron‑regulated transporter 1 ( IREG1) and hephaestin ( HEPH) proteins and their mRNAs were examined in the canine duodenum , kidney , spleen and liver. NCKX3 protein expression was highest in the kidney , moderate in the duodenum , and lowest in the spleen and liver , whereas TRPV2 protein was highly expressed in the kidney , duodenum and liver , and was low in the spleen. The CTR1 protein expression level was highest in the liver , followed ( in descending order) by the duodenum , kidney and spleen. The ATP7A protein expression level was highest in the duodenum and lowest in the spleen. The IREG1 protein expression level was highest in the liver , followed ( in descending order) by the kidney , duodenum and spleen. The HEPH protein level was high in liver , moderate in the duodenum and kidney , and low in the spleen. The results of the immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated ion channel protein localizations. These results suggested that cation channel proteins are differentially expressed among canine organs , and they may be involved in organ‑specific functions associated with the maintenance of physiological homeostasis.
