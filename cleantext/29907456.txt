  There has been considerable interest in acute<symptom> pain<symptom> management over recent years , focusing on pain assessment , pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The evidence base for our clinical decision making and treatment of patients is increasing and becoming more robust. There is still a tendency to base some aspects of pain management on poor quality evidence and this requires further input in years to come. With new literature come new ideas and this review will detail the current knowledge base behind pharmacological management of acute<symptom> pain<symptom> in dogs and cats. The known mechanisms of action of each analgesic and its evidence will be considered. The first part of this review will consider the opioid and anti-inflammatory analgesics , describing their component drugs individually , thereby focusing on their mechanisms of action and the current evidence for their use in acute<symptom> pain<symptom> management.
