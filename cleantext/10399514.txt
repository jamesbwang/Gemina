  Thermosoftening treatment of polyvinyl chloride ( PVC) nasotracheal tubes ( NTTs) can reduce the incidence and amount of epistaxis<symptom> during nasotracheal intubation. The optimal thermal setting for thermosoftening treatment of NTTs without burn injury was investigated. Two composite types of PVC NTTs were used. Following withdrawal of the PVC NTTs from a bottle of water at 45 or 60 째C , the changes in the surface temperature of the NTTs were measured by infrared thermography. Hardness of the NTTs at 25 , 30 , 35 , and 40 째C was measured. The incidence of epistaxis<symptom> during nasotracheal intubation using thermosoftened NTTs was evaluated retrospectively. The surface temperature of both PVC NTTs dipped in 45 and 60 째C water decreased to below body temperature 30 seconds after withdrawing them from the bottles. Although thermosoftening treatment proportionally decreased the hardness of both types of NTTs , the degrees differed according to their composition. When avoiding impingement of the NTT on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx , the incidence of mild and moderate epistaxis<symptom> was 2.3 %. Flexibility of PVC NTTs could be obtained by thermosoftening treatment at 60 째C without burn injury. Thermosoftening treatment of PVC NTTs may be useful to avoid epistaxis<symptom> during nasotracheal intubation.
