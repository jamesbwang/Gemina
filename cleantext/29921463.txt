  Sublingual immunotherapy ( SLIT) has been widely used for the treatment of allergic respiratory<disease> diseases<disease> , but many problems remain unsolved. Currently available data suggest that SLIT is very effective in children and adults with IgE-mediated respiratory<disease> diseases<disease>. Most allergists in China generally believe that SLIT is suitable for allergic rhinitis and asthma due to its safety and tolerability. SLIT for three years is suitable for patients to acquire stable therapeutic effects , and the efficacy of single-allergen SLIT for polysensitized patients has also been confirmed. Nevertheless , there are still several factors restricting its application in China , such as the uncertainty of its long-term effects and the prevention of new sensitizations onset , the risk of asthma attacks , the low public awareness of SLIT and poor compliance by patients. This is a narrative review of current evidence on SLIT coming from China.
