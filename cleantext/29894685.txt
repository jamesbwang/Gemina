  This study aims to demonstrate the role of miR-182 in the glucose metabolism of NSCLC cells and the potential mechanism. MTT Cytotoxicity Assay was used to measure the function of differentially expressed miR-182 on two NSCLC cell lines proliferation. Metabolite analysis was introduced to monitor the glucose consumption , lactate release and glycolytic intermediate metabolites. The mRNA level of critical genes involved in glycolysis was detected by qRT-PCR. The 3 ` UTRs of predicted gene with a miR-182 binding site and their seed-sequence-mutated version were cloned downstream to the ORF of a Renilla luciferase reporter gene and the ability of miR-182 to downregulate luciferase expression was assessed. MiR-182 had significantly improved proliferation of NSCLC cell lines. Metabolite analysis of the cells with strengthened miR-182 revealed significantly increased glucose consumption and lactate release , as well as glycolytic intermediate metabolites , or conversely. Among a panel of genes controlling glucose metabolism , miR-182 exhibited significantly influence on ENO1 , GLUT1 , HIF-1α , HK1 , HK2 , LDHA and PDK1 , especially HIF-1α. For the predicted target gene HIF1AN , the wild-type but not mutated 3 ` UTR , responded to miR-182 b y directing ∼ 45 % reduction of reporter gene expression. MiR-182 promotes glucose metabolism by upregulating HIF-1α in NSCLC cells.
