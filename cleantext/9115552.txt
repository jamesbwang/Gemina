  The knee joint is frequently involved in sports and other injuries with Anterior cruciate ligament being a very common ligament to be injured. The Lachman test , pivot-shift test , and instrumented knee laxity examination are frequently used and reported for evaluation of ACL reconstruction. The aim of this study is to examine and evaluate the relationships between the clinical assessment of ligament stability and subjective assessment of symptoms and function after ACL reconstruction. A total of 50 young and middle aged patients with unilateral knee ACL injury treated with ACL reconstruction using hamstring graft were evaluated for a minimum period of 1 year. Clinical assessment of ligament stability was done through Lachman and pivot-shift examination. Subjective variables of symptoms at follow-up included pain , swelling , instability and locking of knee. Subjective function at follow up included satisfaction with outcome , squatting , ascending or descending stairs , jumping , twisting and Lysholm score. Lachman Examination at follow-up had no significant ( Pivot-shift examination is a better measure than Lachman examination or instrumented knee laxity as far as patients ' functional outcome and overall satisfaction is concerned.
