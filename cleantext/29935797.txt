  The epidemiology of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> depends on conditions in specific populations. Few studies of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> colonization in the older population have been performed in Spain. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MRSA) colonization and its molecular epidemiological characteristics in an institutionalized population in community residential care homes in Cadiz , Spain. A cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted in three residential care homes for older people. Axilla and nostril samples were tested. Identification of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were by MALDI-TOF and MicroScan panels. MRSA strains were subjected to SCCmec typing , multilocus sequence typing ( MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE). The presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin ( PVL) genes was determined by PCR in all S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> strains. A total of 293 residents were included. Fifty-one residents ( 17.4 %) were colonized with methicillin-sensitive S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> ( MSSA) and 11 ( 3.8 %) with MRSA. Resistance to at least two aminoglycosides was observed in 25.4 % of MSSA and 90.9 % and of MRSA isolates , and resistance to levofloxacin in 80.3 % of MSSA and 100 % of MRSA isolates. SCCmecIV was detected in all isolates and all except one ( ST-125) were ST-8. None of the S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> isolates were positive for PVL. A low rate of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> carriage was detected and the prevalence of MRSA was very low. ST8-MRSA-IVc was the dominant clone , and only one strain belonged to ST125-MRSA-IVc. We found MRSA transmission within the residential care homes and a very high rate of quinolone resistance in MSSA and MRSA.
