  This paper has been written because we have a differing idea concerning the suspected negative interference between oxaliplatin and anti-EGFR therapies in cancer patients. Several multicenter , randomized , controlled clinical trials investigated whether the efficacy of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is improved by the addition of anti-EGFR therapies in patients affected by KRAS wild-type advanced colorectal cancer. Results of these trials have produced puzzling findings , with some studies demonstrating improved survival and other studies showing no differences in overall survival between experimental and control arms. Moreover , a detrimental effect has been demonstrated in some settings. Nevertheless , the extent of this interaction remains uncertain. Some physicians proposed personal interpretations. This paper describes our hypothesis.
