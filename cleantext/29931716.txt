  The clinical use of doxorubicin ( DOX) is limited by dose-related cardiomyopathy , which becomes more prevalent with increasing cumulative doses of the drug. Complexes of fullerene with DOX were designed and studied using biophysical methods. The ability of DOX to release from fullerene at different pHs was analyzed. It has been shown that the size of the fullerene-DOX complexes was âˆ¼ 280 nm. The zeta potential for fullerene was -30 mV , for DOX -8 mV , and for fullerene-DOX conjugates -24 mV. Drug release was studied by CE with LIF detection. When fullerene-DOX conjugates were separated in a pH 7.5 buffer , 43 % of all DOX signals were derived from free DOX , with the signal increasing as pH decreased. At pH 5.25 , all DOX had been released and 100 % of the signal was derived from free DOX. The release of DOX from complexes with fullerene at lower pH can be used in targeted antineoplastic therapy , resulting in lower toxicity for less acidic non-target tissue.
