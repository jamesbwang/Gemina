  Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 ( UCP1) is responsible for nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue ( BAT). UCP1 increases the conductance of the inner mitochondrial membrane ( IMM) for protons to make BAT mitochondria generate heat rather than ATP. HDAC6 is a cytosolic deacetylase for non-histone substrates to regulate various cellular processes , including mitochondrial quality control and dynamics. Here , we showed that the body temperature of HDAC6 knockout mice is slightly decreased in normal hosing condition. Interestingly , UCP1 was downregulated in BAT of HDAC6 knockout mice , which extensively linked mitochondrial thermogenesis. Mechanistically , we showed that cAMP-PKA signaling plays a key role in HDAC6-dependent UCP1 expression. Notably , the size of brown adipocytes and lipid droplets in HDAC6 knockout BAT is increased. Taken together , our findings suggested that HDAC6 contributes to mitochondrial thermogenesis in BAT by increasing UCP1 expression through cAMP-PKA signaling pathway.
