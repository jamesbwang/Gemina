  According to Legislative Decree n. 81/08 and Ministerial Circular of 18/11/2010 , this paper proposes to verify the relationship between the sources of risk of stress , sentinel events and gender. Sentinel events and their variations are mapped for three years. Successively , a self-reported OPRA ( Organizational and Psychosocial Risk Assessment) questionnaire was administered. The sample was not probabilistic and balanced for two categories: Inside Sentinel Event and Outside Sentinel Event. 249 subjects were extracted from a population of 770 subjects of a debt collection firm. A two-way ANOVA was applied. The results show that sentinel events and Gender have no relationship with the inventory of sources of risk. Future research should consider the relationship between stressors and their exposure time , considering the working environment dynamics. In this way , the relationship between stressors and sentinel events can be studied and tested in greater detail , showing empirical evidence that may be useful for health prevention programmes.
