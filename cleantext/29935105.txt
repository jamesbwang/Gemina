  An efficient synthetic strategy to 3-methylidene-2,3-dihydroquinolin-4 ( 1H)- ones variously substituted in position 2 has been developed. The title compounds were synthesized in the reaction sequence involving reaction of diethyl methylphosphonate with methyl 2- ( tosylamino) benzoate , condensation of thus formed diethyl 2- ( 2-N-tosylphenyl) 2-oxoethylphosphonate with various aldehydes followed by successful application of the obtained 3-diethoxyphosphoryl-1,2-dihydroquinolin-4-ols as Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reagents for the olefination of formaldehyde. Also , enantioselective approach to the target compounds has been evaluated using 3-dimenthoxyphosphoryl group as a chiral auxiliary. Single x-ray crystal analysis of ( 2S) -3-dimenthoxyphosphoryl-2-phenyl-1-tosyldihydroquinolin-4-ol revealed the presence of strong resonance assisted hydrogen bond ( RAHB). The obtained 3-methylidene-2,3-dihydroquinolin-4 ( 1H)- ones were then tested for their cytotoxic activity against two leukemia<disease> cell lines NALM-6 and HL-60 and a breast cancer MCF-7 cell line. All compounds showed very high cytotoxic activity with the IC
