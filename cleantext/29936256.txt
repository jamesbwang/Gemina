  Mitochondrial DNA copies per cell ( mtDNA content) can fluctuate with cellular aging , oxidative stress , and mitochondrial dysfunction , and has been investigated in cancer , diabetes , Human<pathogen> immunodeficiency<pathogen> virus<pathogen> , and metabolic disease. mtDNA content testing in both clinical and basic settings is expected to rise as research uncovers its biological relevance. Here , we present a novel mtDNA content assay developed on monochrome , multiplex qPCR ( MMqPCR) principles. This assay offers a > 2-fold improvement on time- and cost-effectiveness over conventional ( monoplex) qPCR , as well as improved reproducibility given the reduced effects of human pipetting errors. The new MMqPCR method was compared with the gold standard monoplex qPCR assay on DNA from a variety of sources , including human whole blood , skeletal muscle , and commercial cell lines. The MMqPCR assay is reproducible ( n = 98 , r = 0.99 , P < 0.0001) and highly correlated to the monoplex qPCR assay ( n = 160 , r > 0.98 , P < 0.0001). Intra- and inter-assay variabilities , as established independently by multiple operators , range between 4.3 % to 7.9 % and 2.9 % to 9.2 % , respectively. This robust assay can quantify > 82 pg of template DNA per reaction , with a minimum mtDNA: nuclear DNA ratio of 20 , and is especially suitable for studies that require high throughput.
