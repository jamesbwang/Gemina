  Teleocidin B , with its unique indolactam-terpenoid scaffold , is a potent activator of protein kinase C. This short review summarizes our recent research progress on the biosynthesis of teleocidins in Streptomyces<pathogen> blastmyceticus NBRC 12747. We first identified the biosynthetic genes for teleocidin B , which include genes encoding a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase ( tleA) , a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase ( tleB) , an indol prenyltransferase ( tleC) , and a C-methyltransferase ( tleD). Notably , the tleD gene is located outside the tleABC cluster. Our in vivo and in vitro analyses revealed that TleD not only catalyzes the C-methylation of the prenyl chain but also produces the indole-fused cyclic terpene structure. This is the first report of terpene cyclization initiated by the C-methylation of the prenyl double bond. In contrast , TleC catalyzes the geranylation of the C-7 position of the indole ring , in the reverse fashion. Our X-ray crystallographic analyses provided the structural basis for the reverse prenylation reactions , and structure-based mutagenesis successfully resulted in the production of unnatural , novel prenylated indolactams.
