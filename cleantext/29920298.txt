  Adipose-derived stem cell ( ADSC) transplantation has emerged as a potential tool for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. However , with a limited renewal capacity and the need for mass cells during the engraftment , strategies are needed to enhance ADSC proliferative capacity. In this study , we explored the effects of Exendin-4 , a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog , on the growth of ADSCs , focusing in particular on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K)- protein kinase B ( Akt) and Wnt signaling pathways. Firstly , ADSCs were isolated and cultured in vitro. Then , flow cytometry demonstrated that ADSCs were positive for CD44 , CD90 and CD29 but negative for CD31 , CD34 , and CD45. Exendin-4 ( 0-200 nM) treatment increased ADSC proliferation. In order to examine specific signaling pathways , a western blotting assay was performed. Our results demonstrate that after treated with 50 nM Exendin-4 for 48 hours , the phosphorylation of PI3K , Akt , and GSK3β were increased and phosphorylation of β-catenin was decreased. From these results , we concluded that PI3K-Akt and Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathways mediate Exendin-4 induced ADSC proliferation , the function of which might contribute to the regulation of ADSC proliferation. Our findings provided new insights into the function of the mechanisms underlying Exendin-4 of ADSCs.
