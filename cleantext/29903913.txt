  The integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 ( LFA-1) plays a pivotal role in leukocyte adhesion and migration , but the mechanism ( s) by which this integrin is regulated has remained incompletely understood. LFA-1 integrin activity requires phosphorylation of its β2-chain and interactions of its cytoplasmic tail with various cellular proteins. The α-chain is constitutively phosphorylated and necessary for cellular adhesion , but how the α-chain regulates adhesion has remained enigmatic. We now show that substitution of the α-chain phosphorylation site ( S1140A) in T cells inhibits the phosphorylation of the functionally important Thr-758 in the β2-chain , binding of α-actinin and 14-3-3 protein , and expression of an integrin-activating epitope after treatment with the stromal cell-derived factor-1α. The presence of this substitution resulted in loss of cell adhesion and directional cell migration. Moreover , LFA-1 activation through the T-cell receptor in cells expressing the S1140A LFA-1 variant resulted in less Thr-758 phosphorylation , α-actinin and talin binding , and cell adhesion. The finding that the LFA-1 α-chain regulates adhesion through the β-chain via specific phosphorylation at Ser-1140 in the α-chain has not been previously reported and emphasizes that both chains are involved in the regulation of LFA-1 integrin activity.
