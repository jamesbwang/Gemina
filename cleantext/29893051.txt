  Actinic keratoses ( AKs) can progress into invasive squamous cell carcinoma and thus may become a life threatening disease. Argon plasma coagulation ( APC) might complement the therapeutic armamentarium in particular for AK lesions<symptom>. However , there is no data on APC-induced micromorphological changes following the treatment of AKs. We aimed to determine in vivo APC-induced effects on the epidermis and dermoepidermal junction ( DEJ) zone in AK lesions<symptom>. We performed APC in 108 AKs using the spray mode with a power setting of 15 W and a flow rate of 2.0 L/min. Before and after the intervention , optical coherence tomography ( OCT) was performed. After APC , 74.2 % ( 46/62) lesions<symptom> presented with clearly demarcated DEJ and without any epidermal tissue left , 25.8 % ( 16/62) of treated lesions<symptom> showed residual epidermal tissue left. In 19.4 % ( 12/62) , parts of the DEJ and in 6.5 % ( 4/62) , the entire DEJ could not be discriminated. The Ï‡
