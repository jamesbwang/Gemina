  Nowadays one of the principal challenges of any country is improving the chronic<disease> disease<disease> and cancers. One of the most important of cancers is esophageal cancer in Iran. No doubt , esophageal cancer is an outcome of the interaction and combination of different factors. Cancer of the esophagus is one of the most common causes of death in adults ( especially women) in Iran , where the incidence of this cancer is among the highest in the world. The main aim of this cross-sectional study was to test the hypothesis that food insecurity could create esophageal cancer among women in Iran ( Zanjan Province). The method of this paper has been based on the analytical and descriptive research using fuzzy cognitive maps ( FCMs) method. The subjects were 580 women aged 40-70 years ( 150 women have esophageal cancer) , and they are selected randomly in the Zanjan Province of Iran. The food insecurity ( such as hunger and hidden hunger) in the Zanjan Province , according to the 24 h food-recall questionnaire was 23 % and 38 % , respectively. Only 39 % of the study population was secure in terms of having access to all key nutrients. The accuracy of the questionnaire for screening for hunger in the population was 88.78 % , respectively , and the corresponding value for hidden hunger was 83.4 %. The average value of esophageal cancer predicted using fuzzy cognitive maps is equal to 75.43 % ( for 36 months). Our findings showed an association of food insecurity and body mass index ( BMI) in the study population. Food insecurity increased the rate of underweight and decreased the rates of overweight and obesity.
