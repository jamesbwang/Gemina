  Dose reduction using additional filters with high kilovoltage peak ( kVp) for abdominal digital radiography has received much attention recently. We evaluated image quality with dose reduction in abdominal digital radiography by using high kVp and additional copper filters at a tertiary hospital. Between June 2016 and July 2016 , 82 patients underwent abdominal digital radiography using 80 kVp in X-ray room 1 and 82 were imaged using 92 kVp with 0.1-mm copper filtration in X-ray room 2. The effective dose was calculated using a PC-based Monte Carlo program. Image quality of the abdominal radiography acquired in the two rooms was evaluated using a five-point ordinal scale , as well as the signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios. The mean effective dose decreased by 25.8 % and 25.7 % for the supine and standing positions , respectively , when abdominal digital radiography using 92 kVp with 0.1-mm copper filtration was performed. In the 20 patients who performed abdominal digital radiography twice in each room , visual grading scores for visualisation of psoas outlines and kidney outlines are higher in room 1. However , there was no statistical significant difference of visual grading scores among the 124 patients who underwent only one abdominal radiography in the room 1 or 2 ( P > 0.05). Dose reduction for abdominal digital radiography can be achieved with comparable image quality by performing abdominal digital radiography using 92 kVp with 0.1-mm copper filtration , despite the higher AEC dose.
