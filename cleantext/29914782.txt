  Injection of local anesthetic into the transversus abdominis plane ( TAP block) decreases systemic morphine requirements after abdominal surgery. We compared intraoperative surgeon-administered TAP block ( surgical TAP) to anesthesiologist-administered transcutaneous ultrasound-guided TAP block ( conventional TAP) for post-cesarean analgesia. We hypothesized that surgical TAP blocks would take less time to perform than conventional TAP blocks. We performed a randomized trial , recruiting 41 women undergoing cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia , assigning them to either surgical TAP block ( n = 20) or conventional TAP block ( n = 21). Time taken to perform the block was the primary outcome , while postoperative pain scores and 24-hour opioid requirements were secondary outcomes. Student 's t-test was used to compare block time and Kruskal-Wallis test opioid consumption and pain-scores. Time taken to perform the block ( 2.4 vs 12.1 min , P < 0.001) , and time spent in the operating room after delivery ( 55.3 vs 77.9 min , P < 0.001) were significantly less for surgical TAP. The 24 h morphine consumption ( P = 0.17) and postoperative pain scores at 4 , 8 , 24 and 48 h were not significantly different between the groups. Surgical TAP blocks are feasible and less time consuming than conventional TAP blocks , while providing comparable analgesia after cesarean delivery.
