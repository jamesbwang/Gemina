  Cyanophycin is a bacterial storage polymer for carbon , nitrogen and energy with emerging industrial applications. As efficient cyanophycin production is enhanced by peptone , but commercial peptones are very expensive , thereby increasing the overall production cost , an enzymatically produced feather hydrolysate ( FH) is assessed as a cheap replacement of peptone to lower the costs and make cyanophycin production more economically feasible. Keratinase production using feather as the sole carbon/nitrogen source by S.pactum 40530 at 30-L fermentation scale was achieved within 93 h with degradation rate of 96.5 %. A concentration of 60 g/L of FH , generated by keratinolytic activity ( 8 Ã— 10
