  Several growth factors ( GFs) are expressed as tendons heal , but it remains unknown whether their combined application enhances the healing process. This matter was addressed by applying a combination of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF) , bone morphogenetic protein 12 ( BMP-12) and transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGFÎ²1) in a rat Achilles tendon transection model. GFs were applied in one of the three following ways: i) direct application of all three factors at the time of surgery; ii) sequential , tiered percutaneous injection of individual factors immediately after surgery , 48 h and 96 h later; iii) load of all three factors onto a collagen sponge implanted at the time of surgery. After 1 , 2 , 4 and 8 weeks , healing was assessed based on tendon length and thickness , mechanical strength , stiffness and histology. Best results were achieved when GFs were loaded onto a collagen sponge- with a rapid increase in mechanical strength ( load to failure , 71.2 N vs. 7.7 N in controls) , consistent tendon length over time ( 9.9 mm vs. 16.2 mm in controls) and faster tendon remodelling , as measured by histology- followed by tiered injection therapy over 96 h. In conclusion , implantation of a GF-loaded collagen sponge could provide a promising treatment , especially in high-performance athletes and revision cases prone to re-rupture. For conservative treatment , tiered percutaneous GF application could be an option for improving clinical outcome.
