  As secreted protein and membrane-bound proteins , netrins play important roles in biological processes such as neural cell migration , differentiation and apoptosis. Netrins were thought to guide axon outgrowth and central nervous system morphology since they were discovered. Besides , they also participate in physiological processes such as cell adhesion , migration , differentiation , angiogenesis , lymph angiogenesis , and inflammation<symptom> in non-neural tissues. Recent studies showed that netrins also involved in the regulation of initiation and development of various tumors including colorectal cancer , pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Because of the functional diversity of netrins and the different biological effects of different receptors in tumor tissue , the specific mechanism of their action in tumors remains unclear. Based on current research progress of our group , this review summed up recent research findings on netrins in relation to cancer biology , suggested possible mechanisms , and discussed the implications in cancer research and intervention.
