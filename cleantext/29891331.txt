  The aim of this study was to investigate the association of serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) levels with platelet reactivity and antidiabetes treatment , as well as serum adipocytokine concentrations. This observational , open-label study enrolled 149 patients. Serum BDNF , hematologic , biochemical parameters and platelet reactivity were measured. Blood samples were taken after the last acetylsalicylic acid dose. Patients with high BDNF levels were younger ( 65.60 ± 8.956 vs. 68.59 ± 8.516) and smoked cigarettes more frequently ( 14.6 % vs. 4.1 %); they were more commonly being treated by metformin ( 77.3 % vs. 54 %); had higher platelet counts ( 245.81 ± 68.85 10 Our results suggest that BDNF may be associated with lipid metabolism and that increased production of BDNF may be related to metformin treatment. Moreover , we showed an association between BDNF levels and platelet reactivity; we found that serum BDNF levels in patients with type 2 diabetes who had high platelet reactivity were higher than in subjects with normal platelet reactivity despite antiplatelet therapy.
