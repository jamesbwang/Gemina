  Development of highly efficient and easy-handling absorbents for heavy metals removal is desirable for the remediation of our existing aquatic system. Herein , we demonstrated the novel bamboo-like polypyrrole nanofibrous mats for the removal of highly toxic hexavalent chromium ( Cr ( VI)) from aqueous solution. To achieve this target , the V
