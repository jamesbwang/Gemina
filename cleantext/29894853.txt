  The emission intensity of GaInAsP semiconductors that show an ion sensitivity is altered by the surface charge. In this study , we propose a biosensing technique using GaInAsP photonic crystal nanolasers based on this principle. Here , simple and rapid detection of collapsin response mediator protein 2 ( CRMP2) is demonstrated , which is a promising biomarker candidate for neuropsychiatric diseases existing in peripheral white blood cells. We prepared CRMP2 as a standard protein and introduced sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS) as an anionic surfactant to enhance the net negative charge of the protein. The nanolaser was modified in advance with an anti-CRMP2 antibody and then photopumped at a constant power. The laser emission intensity was monitored during the antibody-antigen reaction. Consequently , CRMP2 was detected as a decrease in the emission intensity. We achieved a lower limit for detection of 3.8 Î¼g/mL that satisfies the requirement for clinical biomarker testing. Without the requirements of any kind of labels and spectral analyses , this technique allows for simple , rapid , and low-cost biomarker detection.
