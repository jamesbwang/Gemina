  Previous research on theory of mind suggests that people with schizophrenia have difficulties with complex mentalization tasks that involve the integration of cognition and affective mental states. One of the tools most commonly used to assess theory of mind is the Faux-Pas Test. However , it presents two main methodological problems: 1) the lack of a standard scoring system; 2) the different versions are not comparable due to a lack of information on the stories used. These methodological problems make it difficult to draw conclusions about performance on this test by people with schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to develop a reduced version of the Faux-Pas test with adequate psychometric properties. The test was administered to control and clinical groups. Interrater and test-retest reliability were analyzed for each story in order to select the set of 10 stories included in the final reduced version. The shortened version showed good psychometric properties for controls and patients: test-retest reliability of 0.97 and 0.78 , inter-rater reliability of 0.95 and 0.87 and Cronbach 's alpha of 0.82 and 0.72.
