  In this study , quantitative structure-activity relationship ( QSAR) models were determined based on 91 antioxidant tripeptides. We firstly adopted the stepwise regression ( SWR) method for selecting key variables without autocorrelation and then utilized multiple linear regression ( MLR) , support vector machine ( SVM) , random forest<disease> ( RF) , and partial least square regression ( PLS) to develop predictive QSAR models based on the screened variables. The results demonstrated that all the established models have good reliability (
