  Hyper-IgG4 syndrome<disease> is a rare cause of bilateral proptosis. It must always be considered after ruling out orbital lymphoma. We report a case of progressive bilateral proptosis for 4 years in a 34-year-old man. Orbital MRI showed an infiltrative process extending to the orbital fat , extraocular muscles and lacrimal glands. Lacrimal gland biopsy with immunohistochemical study showed a lymphoplasmocytic infiltrate rich in IgG4 and fibrosis<disease>. The diagnosis of orbital hyper-IgG4 syndrome<disease> was suggested. The patient responded well to systemic steroid treatment. Orbital hyper-IgG4 syndrome<disease> manifests most often as pseudo-tumoral bilateral proptosis. Elevated IgG4 levels are neither sensitive nor specific. Biopsy with immunohistochemical study is the key to diagnosis. Systemic steroid treatment is the gold standard , but recurrences may occur.
