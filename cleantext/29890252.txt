  The clinical efficacy of curcumin-containing nutraceuticals ( e.g. turmeric preparations , curcumin , curcuminoids) for a range of conditions has been assessed by several systematic reviews , in some instances with contradictory conclusions. Our aim was to provide an up-to-date and rigorous synthesis of these data and to evaluate the quality of the available systematic reviews. Electronic searches were conducted ( up to December 2017) to locate all systematic reviews ( SRs) related to the use of curcumin-containing nutraceuticals for any condition. The quality of the retrieved SRs was assessed by using AMSTAR an OQAQ tolls. Twenty-two SRs met our inclusion criteria. Overall , four SRs were of high quality using the AMSTAR scale , whereas twelve SRs achieved an high quality classification according to the OQAQ score. There is some evidence that curcumin-containing nutraceuticals can exert systemic antioxidant actions ( 1 SR) and may be effective i) in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis-related diseases and inflammatory bowel disease ( 12 SRs) , ii) in reducing lipid levels and cardiovascular risk factors ( 5 SRs) as well as iii) in skin diseases ( 1 SR). Cautious preliminary positive results were reported for depressive disorders ( 3 SRs) , while no efficacy was observed in Alzheimer 's disease patients ( 1 SR). Curcumin-containing nutraceuticals appear to be safe , as assessed by the adverse events reported in twelve SRs. Based on the currently available SRs , the efficacy of curcumin-containing nutraceuticals has been demonstrated for several conditions; however , due to the poor quality of the primary trials and the low-to-moderate level of some SRs , there is still some uncertainty.
