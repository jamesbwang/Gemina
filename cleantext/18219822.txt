  Among autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system stands multiple sclerosis ( MS) , which is characterized by demyelination , synaptopathy , and neurodegeneration. MS fatigue<symptom> can affect up to 90 % of patients and be very disabling , with a drastic impact on their quality of life. To date , the evaluation of MS fatigue<symptom> has relied mainly on subjective scales , and actual therapeutic interventions are challenged by modest efficacy and numerous undesirable effects. Therefore , finding biomarkers of MS fatigue<symptom> might help in optimizing evaluation and treatment strategies. The main objective here was to assess the relationship between MS fatigue<symptom> and inflammatory or other immunomediated markers. Research was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Computerized databases ( ie , PubMed/Medline and Scopus) were consulted till February 2018 aiming to identify articles that addressed inflammation<symptom> and MS fatigue<symptom>. Studies in English and French published at any time were considered. A total of 27 studies matched the research criteria. Inconsistency existed regarding the relationship between fatigue<symptom> and the orexin A system , hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis , and cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory markers. As for peripheral markers , although there was scarcity in the available data , serum proinflammatory cytokines ( ie , IL6 , TNFα , and IFNγ) seem to be associated with MS fatigue<symptom>. Finally , no link was found between MS fatigue<symptom> and T-cell populations ( ie , CD3 Future large-scale studies would benefit from comparing the relationship between fatigue<symptom> and immune measures in patients with different disease phenotypes with and without disease-modifying drugs. With the subjective nature of fatigue<symptom> scales , finding objective biomarkers for fatigue<symptom> would be of great help.
