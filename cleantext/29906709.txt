  Lurasidone , an azapirone derivative , is a novel second generation antipsychotic with potent binding affinity for dopamine D2 , serotonin 5-HT Double-blinded RCTs reporting on the short-term effects of lurasidone were included. Standardized mean difference ( SMD) with their 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , and number needed to harm ( NNH) were computed. The meta-analysis had 8 RCTs with 16 active arms that included 2373 patients with acute schizophrenia who were randomized to either lurasidone ( 20-160 mg/day; n = 1570) or placebo ( n = 803) groups. Lurasidone was superior to placebo with regard to change in total psychopathology ( SMD: -0.34 , ( 95 % CI: -0.48 , -0.20) , P < 0.00001) , positive symptoms ( SMD: -0.47 , ( 95 % CI: -0.57 , -0.36) , P < 0.00001) , negative symptoms ( SMD: -0.34 , ( 95 % CI: -0.45 , -0.22) , P < 0.00001) , and general psychopathology ( SMD: -0.36 , ( 95 % CI: -0.48 , -0.24) , P < 0.00001). Results were consistent for total psychopathology in 11 out of the 13 subgroups. Lurasidone resulted in higher weight gain ( SMD: 0.15 , ( 95 % CI: 0.06 , 0.24) , P = 0.001) and BMI ( SMD: 0.17 , ( 95 % CI: 0.07 , 0.28) , P = 0.002) than placebo , but the differences were not clinically significant. Lurasidone group had less frequent inefficacy ( NNH = 14) and discontinuation due to any reason ( NNH = 17) , but was associated with more frequent vomiting<symptom> , akathisia , dystonia , parkinsonism , somnolence , dizziness<symptom> , sedation , nausea<symptom> , and weight gain of â‰¥ 7 % of the initial weight ( NNH = 11-50). This meta-analysis of 8 short-term studies supported the efficacy and safety of lurasidone in the acute phase of schizophrenia , particularly at the higher dose range of 80 mg/day.
