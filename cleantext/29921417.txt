  Disrupted proactive cognitive control , a form of early selection and active goal maintenance , is hypothesized to underlie the broad cognitive deficits observed in patients with schizophrenia ( SPs). Current research suggests that the disrupted activation within and connectivity between regions of the cognitive control network contribute to disrupted proactive cognitive control; however , no study has examined these mechanisms using an AX Continuous Performance Test task in schizophrenia. Twenty-six SPs ( 17 male subjects; mean age 34.46 ± 8.77 years) and 28 healthy control participants ( HCs; 16 male subjects; mean age 31.43 ± 7.23 years) underwent an electroencephalogram while performing the AX Continuous Performance Test. To examine the extent of activation and level of connectivity within the cognitive control network , power , intertrial phase clustering , and intersite phase clustering metrics were calculated and analyzed. SPs exhibited expected general decrements in behavioral performance relative to HCs and a more selective deficit in conditions requiring proactive cognitive control. Additionally , SPs exhibited deficits in midline theta power and connectivity during proactive cognitive control trials. Specifically , HCs exhibited significantly greater theta power for B cues relative to A cues , whereas SPs exhibited no significant differences between A- and B-cue theta power. Additionally , differential theta connectivity patterns were observed in SPs and HCs. Behavioral measures of proactive cognitive control predicted functional outcomes in SPs. This study suggests that low-frequency midline theta activity is selectively disrupted during proactive cognitive control in SPs. The disrupted midline theta activity may reflect a failure of SPs to proactively recruit cognitive control processes.
