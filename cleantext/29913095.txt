  Macrophages are among the main cells involved in generation of inflammation<symptom>. To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of Satureja hortensis ( summer savory) , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- activated J774 .1 macrophages were treated with various extracts , and the expression and release of various inflammatory molecules by macrophages were examined. We showed that dichloromethane and hexane extracts reduced nitric oxide ( NO) production more efficiently than other extracts. Both extracts decreased gene expression of inducible NO synthase ( iNOS) ( < 0.44 fold of control) , cyclooxygenase ( COX) -2 ( < 0.29 fold) , interleukin ( IL) -1 β ( < 0.41 fold) , IL-6 ( < 0.25 fold) and tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF)- α ( < 0.2 fold). The extracts reduced IL-6 and IL-1β proteins production from macrophages. Surface intensity of expression of intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM) -1 decreased to 845 ± 28.1 ( dichloromethane) and 715 ± 48.6 ( hexane) compared to the control ( 902 ± 73.1). These findings showed that Satureja hortensis , by influencing macrophages and related mediators , could contribute to reduction of inflammation<symptom> and might be useful as an anti-inflammatory agent.
