  Databases of electronic health records ( EHR) are not only a valuable source of data for health research but have also recently been used as a medium through which potential study participants can be screened , located and approached to take part in research. The aim was to assess whether it is feasible and practical to screen , locate and approach patients to take part in research through the Clinical Practice Research Datalink ( CPRD). This is a cohort study in primary care. The CPRD anonymised EHR database was searched to screen patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD) to take part in a research study. The potential participants were contacted via their General Practitioner ( GP) who confirmed their eligibility. Eighty two practices across Greater London were invited to the study. Twenty-six ( 31.7 %) practices consented to participate resulting in a pre-screened list of 988 patients. Of these , 632 ( 63.7 %) were confirmed as eligible following the GP review. Two hundred twenty seven ( 36 %) response forms were received by the study team; 79 ( 34.8 %) responded ` yes ' ( i.e. , they wanted to be contacted by the research assistant for more information and to talk about enrolling in the study) , and 148 ( 65.2 %) declined participation. This study has shown that it is possible to use EHR databases such as CPRD to screen , locate and recruit participants for research. This method provides access to a cohort of patients while minimising input needed by GPs and allows researchers to examine healthcare usage and disease burden in more detail and in real-life settings.
