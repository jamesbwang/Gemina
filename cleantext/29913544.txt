  To perform a comprehensive review of the current evidence on the role of uterine artery Doppler , isolated or in combination with other markers , in screening for preeclampsia ( PE) and fetal growth restriction ( FGR) in the general population. The review included recently published large cohort studies and randomized trials. A search of the literature was conducted using Medline , PubMed , MeSH and ScienceDirect. Combinations of the search terms `` preeclampsia , '' `` screening , '' `` prediction , '' `` Doppler , '' `` Doppler velocimetry , '' `` fetal growth restriction , '' `` small for gestational age '' and `` uterine artery '' were used. Articles in English ( excluding reviews) reporting the use of uterine artery Doppler in screening for PE and FGR were included. Thirty articles were included. As a single predictor , uterine artery Doppler detects less than 50 % of the cases of PE and no more than 40 % of the pregnancies affected by FGR. Logistic regression-based models that allow calculation of individual risk based on the combination of multiple markers , in turn , is able to detect âˆ¼ 75 % of the cases of preterm PE and 55 % of the pregnancies resulting in small for gestational age infants. The use of uterine artery Doppler as a single predictive test for PE and FGR has poor accuracy. However , its combined use in predictive models is promising , being more accurate in detecting preterm PE than FGR.
