  We present the Focus-Induced Photoresponse ( FIP) technique , a novel approach to optical distance measurement. It takes advantage of a universally-observed phenomenon in photodetector devices , an irradiance-dependent responsivity. This means that the output from a sensor is not only dependent on the total flux of incident photons , but also on the size of the area in which they fall. If probe light from an object is cast on the detector through a lens , the sensor response depends on how far in or out of focus the object is. We call this the FIP effect. Here we demonstrate how to use the FIP effect to measure the distance to that object. We show that the FIP technique works with different sensor types and materials , as well as visible and near infrared light. The FIP technique operates on a working principle , which is fundamentally different from all established distance measurement methods and hence offers a way to overcome some of their limitations. FIP enables fast optical distance measurements with a simple single-pixel detector layout and minimal computational power. It allows for measurements that are robust to ambient light even outside the wavelength range accessible with silicon.
