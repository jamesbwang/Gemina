  Arteries with 1-mm thick walls can be successfully vitrified by loading cryoprotective agents ( CPAs) such as VS55 ( 8.4 M) or less concentrated DP6 ( 6 M) and cooling at or beyond their critical cooling rates of 2.5 and 40 °C/ min , respectively. Successful warming from this vitrified state , however , can be challenging. For example , convective warming by simple warm-bath immersion achieves 70 °C/ min , which is faster than VS55 's critical warming rate of 55 °C/ min , but remains far below that of DP6 ( 185 °C/ min). Here we present a new method that can dramatically increase the warming rates within either a solution or tissue by inductively warming commercially available metal components placed within solutions or in proximity to tissues with non-invasive radiofrequency fields ( 360 kHz , 20 kA/m). Directly measured warming rates within solutions exceeded 1000 °C/ min with specific absorption rates ( W/g) of 100 , 450 and 1000 for copper foam , aluminum foil , and nitinol mesh , respectively. As proof of principle , a carotid artery diffusively loaded with VS55 and DP6 CPA was successfully warmed with high viability using aluminum foil , while standard convection failed for the DP6 loaded tissue. Modeling suggests this approach can improve warming in tissues up to 4-mm thick where diffusive loading of CPA may be incomplete. Finally , this technology is not dependent on the size of the system and should therefore scale up where convection can not.
