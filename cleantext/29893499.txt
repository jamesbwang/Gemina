  Homo- and hetero-bifunctional linkers play vital roles in constructing a variety of functional systems ranging from protein bioconjugates with drugs and functional agents , surface modification of nanoparticles and living cells , to the cyclization/ dimerization of synthetic polymers and biomolecules. Conventional approaches for assaying conjugation extents typically rely on ex situ techniques such as mass spectrometry , gel electrophoresis , and size-exclusion chromatograph. If the conjugation process involving bifunctional linkers was rendered fluorogenic , then in situ monitoring , quantification , and optical tracking/visualization of relevant processes will be achieved. In this review , conventional non-fluorogenic linkers will be discussed at first. We then focus on the evolution and emerging applications of fluorogenic bifunctional linkers , which are categorized into hetero-bifunctional single-caging fluorogenic ( SCF) linkers , homo-bifunctional double-caging fluorogenic ( DCF) linkers , and hetero-bifunctional double-caging fluorogenic ( DDCF) linkers. In addition , stimuli-cleavable bifunctional linkers designed for both conjugation and subsequent site-specific triggered release will also be summarized.
