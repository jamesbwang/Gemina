  We hypothesize that the reduced peak aerobic power ( peak V˙O2) after heart transplantation is due to impaired cardiovascular and skeletal muscle function , and its improvement with short-term ( ≤ 1 yr) exercise training is primarily due to favorable skeletal muscle adaptations. Furthermore , the increased peak V˙O2 with long-term ( > 2 yr) training is primarily mediated by cardiac ( sympathetic) reinnervation.
