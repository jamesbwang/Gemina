  Droplet evaporation of multicomponent droplets is essential for various physiochemical applications , e.g. , in inkjet printing , spray cooling , and microfabrication. In this work , we observe and study the phase segregation of an evaporating sessile binary droplet , consisting of a miscible mixture of water and a surfactantlike liquid ( 1,2-hexanediol). The phase segregation ( i.e. , demixing) leads to a reduced water evaporation rate of the droplet , and eventually the evaporation process ceases due to shielding of the water by the nonvolatile 1,2-hexanediol. Visualizations of the flow field by particle image velocimetry and numerical simulations reveal that the timescale of water evaporation at the droplet rim is faster than that of the Marangoni flow , which originates from the surface tension difference between water and 1,2-hexanediol , eventually leading to segregation.
