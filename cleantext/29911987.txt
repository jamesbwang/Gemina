  The conductive-bridge random access memory ( CBRAM) has become one of the most suitable candidates for non-volatile memory in next-generation information and communication technology. The resistive switching ( RS) mechanism of CBRAM depends on the formation/annihilation of the conductive filament ( CF) between the active metal electrode and the inert electrode. However , excessive ion injection from the active electrode into the solid electrolyte reduces the uniformity and reliability of the RS devices. To solve this problem , we investigated the RS characteristics of a CuSn alloy active electrode with different compositions of Cu
