  To examine the trend of stunting and wasting among children age between 6 and 17 in China. A multistage cluster random sampling process was used to investigate 36 058 children aged 6-17 years in 2010-2012 in 31 provinces ( municipalities , autonomous region) in China. Their height and weight were measured , prevalence of stunting and wasting were calculated according to national standard of malnutrition screening among school children and adolescents ( WS/T 456-2014) to compare children malnutrition status in children and adolescents in four classified areas. Data was weighted by post stratification adjustment , according to standard population data in 2009 from State Statistical Bureau. The prevalence of stunting among childrenand adolescents aged 6 to 17 in China in 2010-2012 were 3. 2 % ( 95 % CI 2. 6 % -3. 8 %) , among boys were 3. 6 % ( 95 % CI 2. 9 % -4. 3 %) and girls were 2. 8 % ( 95 % CI 2. 2 % -3. 3 %). Stunting rate among children and adolescents aged 6-17 in urban area were 1. 5 % ( 95 % CI 1. 0 % -2. 1 %) , and rural area were 4. 7 % ( 95 % CI 3. 8 % -5. 6 %). Prevalence of stunting showed rising trend with the decline of economic level. Total prevalence of wasting among children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years in China in2010-2012 were 9. 0 % ( 95 % CI 8. 0 % -9. 9 %) , 10. 4 % ( 95 % CI 9. 3 % -11. 6 %) for boys and 7. 3 % ( 95 % CI 6. 5 % -8. 1 %) for girls , 7. 8 % ( 95 % CI 6. 6 % -9. 0 %) for urban area and 10. 0 % ( 95 % CI 8. 6 % -11. 4 %) for rural area. Prevalence of wasting also showed rising trend with the decline of economic level. The overall prevalence of stunting and wasting among Chinese children and adolescents in 31 provinces ( municipalities , autonomous region) was relatively low , however , stunting and wasting in poor areas should still be concerned.
