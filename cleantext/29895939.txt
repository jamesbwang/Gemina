  Overweight and diabetes are known cancer risk factors. This study examines independent and combined effects of weight gain and metabolic dysfunction during middle-adult years on obesity-related cancer risk. Subjects ( n = 3850) aged 45-69 years at exams 3-5 in the Framingham Offspring Study were classified according to current and prior ( ~ 14 years earlier) weight<symptom> status<symptom> , interim weight change and prevalent metabolic dysfunction. Cancer risk among subjects who were overweight at baseline and remained overweight , as well as those who became overweight during follow-up , was compared with risk among normal-weight individuals. Gaining ≥ 0.45 kg ( ≥ 1.0 pound)/ year ( vs. maintaining stable weight) over ~ 14 years increased cancer risk by 38 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.09 , 1.76); combined with metabolic dysfunction , weight gain increased cancer risk by 77 % ( 95 % CI , 1.21 , 2.59). Compared with non-overweight adults , men and women who became overweight during midlife had 2.18-fold and 1.60-fold increased cancer risks; those who were overweight from baseline had non-statistically significant 28 and 33 % increased cancer risks , respectively , despite having a midlife body mass index that was 3.4 kg/m Midlife weight gain was a strong cancer risk factor. This excess risk was somewhat stronger among those with concurrent metabolic dysfunction.
