  The present study was performed to detect cancer risk of the midwifes and nurses playing central role in raising awareness in the society using Gail 's model. Sample of the present cross sectional study consists of 750 volunteer midwifes and nurses in 2016. Breast cancer risk was calculated using the Gail Risk Assessment Tool. Perceived and calculated risk levels were compared. Descriptive statistics and Chi-Square analysis , t-test , Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis , the Logistic Regression Analysis were conducted. A mean of 5 years risk ( 0.8 % ± 0.52) and a mean of lifetime risk ( 11.03 % ± 4.46) were computed. It was found that risk of development of breast cancer over the next 5-years period was high for 7.1 % of the midwifes and nurses. The difference between the breast cancer risk perception level of women and the breast cancer risk level according to the Gail Model was significant ( p < 0.01). It was determined that the midwives and nurses , who thought that they had high risks for individual breast cancer , had mammography with a higher frequency ( p < 0.00) and went to clinics for breast examination on a regular basis ( p < 0.01). Considering the fact that participants were healthcare professionals , the use of clinical breast examination and mammography practices as a preventive behavior by nurses and midwives was lower than expected.
