  Psychometric study. To assess the reliability and validity of the Italian-translated and adapted version of the Van Lieshout test ( VLT) in a population of people with cervical spinal cord injury ( C-SCI). Multicenter study in multiple hospitals in Italy. The original scale was translated from English to Italian according to international guidelines. The internal consistency , test-retest reliability , and responsiveness of the Italian version of the VLT ( IT-VLT) were examined. The IT-VLT was administered to 50 individuals with C-SCI , and its construct and convergent validity were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients with the Italian version of the Spinal Cord Injury Measure version III ( SCIM III). All psychometric properties of the IT-VLT showed significant values , including the Cronbach 's The IT-VLT was a reliable and a valid outcome measure for assessing hand function in the Italian population with C-SCI.
