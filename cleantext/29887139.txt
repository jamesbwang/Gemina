  Genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( CJD) is associated with mutations in the human PrP gene ( PRNP) on chromosome 20p12-pter. Pathogenic mutations have been identified in 10-15 % of all CJD patients , who often have a family history of autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance and variable penetrance. However , the use of genetic tests implemented by surveillance networks all over the world increasingly identifies unexpectedly PRNP mutations in persons apparently presenting with a sporadic form of CJD. A high phenotypic variability was reported in genetic prion diseases , which partly overlap with the features of sporadic CJD. Here we review recent advances on the epidemiologic , clinical , and neuropathologic features of cases that phenotypically resemble CJD linked to point and insert mutations of the PRNP gene. Multidisciplinary studies are still required to understand the phenotypic spectrum , penetrance , and significance of PRNP mutations.
