  The PREVENtion of HeartMate II pump Thrombosis through clinical management ( PREVENT) study was a multicenter , prospective investigation to evaluate the rate of pump thrombosis ( PT) with adoption of a uniform set of surgical and medical practices for left ventricular assist device implantation. We sought to quantify pump position at baseline and retrospectively define a pump position associated with poor clinical outcomes. Chest x-rays at baseline were prospectively obtained per protocol. Pump pocket depth , inflow cannula ( IC) angle relative to the pump , and IC angle relative to the vertical were measured. Pumps falling in the tail-ends of the IC angle and pump pocket depth distributions were categorized as having an extreme pump position within the PREVENT study. Patients with extreme pump position had a significantly higher risk of confirmed and suspected PT , hemolysis<symptom> , and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. In a multivariable analysis of survival free of confirmed PT , extreme pump position was an independent risk factor ( hazard ratio = 3.6; 95 % confidence interval = 1.5-8.9; p = 0.006) when adjusting for differences in pump speed and anticoagulation level. Our analysis shows that HeartMate II pump position at implant can significantly impact event-free survival and the incidence of adverse events at 6 months.
