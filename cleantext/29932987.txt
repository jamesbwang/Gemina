  The Ras-homologous GTPase Rac1 plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression , cytoskeleton-associated processes and cell death as well as carcinogenesis and inflammation<symptom>. Here , we investigated the impact of Rac1 signaling on liver-mediated immune homeostasis. We employed a constitutive Alb-Cre-driven rac1 knock-out and a poly I: C-inducible Mx1-Cre-based knock-out model and analyzed cytokine expression profiles in liver and other organs under basal situation and following LPS-induced endotoxemia by flow cytometry , qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Constitutive Alb-Cre-driven rac1 knockout in hepatocytes altered the basal distribution and activation of immune cells in the liver and likewise in kidney and lung. Early systemic alterations in cytokine serum levels following LPS treatment remained unaffected by Rac1. Furthermore , lack of Rac1 in hepatocytes of untreated animals shifted the liver to a chronic inflammatory state , as depicted by an enhanced mRNA expression of marker genes related to activated macrophages. Upon acute LPS-induced endotoxemia , increased IL-10 mRNA expression in the liver of Alb-Cre Rac1-deficient mice provided an anti-inflammatory response. Employing a poly I: C-inducible Mx1-Cre-based rac1 knock-out , which allows a more widespread rac1 deletion in both hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes , we observed substantial differences regarding both basal and LPS-stimulated cytokine expression profiles as compared to the Alb-Cre system. Rac1-dependent mechanisms in hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes contribute to the maintenance of liver immune homeostasis under basal situation and following LPS-induced endotoxemia. Disturbed Rac1-regulated hepatocyte functions may promote liver damage under pathophysiological situation involving inflammatory stress.
