  Human lymphoblast cells from a male diagnosed with Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) expressing the TREM2 p.R47H variant were used to generate integration-free induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs) by over-expressing episomal-based plasmids harbouring OCT4 , SOX2 , KLF4 , LIN28 , L-MYC and p53 shRNA. The derived iPSC line- AD-TREM2-3 was defined as pluripotent based on ( i) expression of pluripotency-associated markers ( ii) embryoid body-based differentiation into cell types representative of the three germ layers and ( iii) the similarity between the transcriptome of the iPSC line and the human embryonic stem cell line H1 with a Pearson correlation of 0.940.
