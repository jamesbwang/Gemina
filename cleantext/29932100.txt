  Alzheimer & rsquo; s disease ( AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease , distinctively characterized by senile plaques , neurofibrillary tangles , and synaptic loss , finally resulting in neuronal death. & beta;- Site amyloid precursor protein ( APP) cleaving enzyme 1 ( BACE1) and cholinesterases have been identified as therapeutic targets for AD , and the discovery of their inhibitors is of critical importance for developing preventive strategies for AD. To discover natural multi-target compounds possessing BACE1 , acetylcholinesterase ( AChE) , and butyrylcholinesterase ( BChE) inhibitory properties , major citrus flavanones including hesperetin , naringenin , and hesperidin were evaluated. In vitro anti-AD activities were performed via BACE1 and cholinesterases inhibition assays , as well as enzyme kinetic predictions. For the design of potential inhibitors of AD-related enzymes , molecular docking analysis was performed. Based on the biological evaluation , hesperidin demonstrated the best inhibitory properties toward BACE1 , AChE , and BChE , with IC
