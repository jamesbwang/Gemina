  Healthy ageing is a multi-dimensional concept which appertains to all older adults. This study reviewed the intervention characteristics , intervention content and effectiveness of multi-dimensional healthy ageing interventions ( MHAIs) addressing physical , mental and social health among independent community-dwelling older adults. A search was conducted in PubMed , CINAHL , Embase , Scopus , and PsycINFO for studies published from Jan 2007 to October 2016. 18 publications were included , accounting for 15 studies. The review reflected the complexity , variations and methodological considerations of developing a comprehensive MHAI. It demonstrated the possibility of integrating person-focused to environment-focused content topics in future MHAIs , beyond the physical , mental and social health dimensions. Among the reviewed studies , health education programs reported improvements in quality of life and life satisfaction while health assessment and education programs promoted positive health behaviors. Future MHAIs studies need to employ more robust research methods and greater contextual information reports to build stronger evidence base.
