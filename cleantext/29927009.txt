  Ecological speciation and adaptive radiation are key processes shaping northern temperate freshwater fish diversity. Both often involve parapatric differentiation between stream and lake populations and less often , sympatric intralacustrine diversification into habitat- and resource-associated ecotypes. However , few taxa have been studied , calling for studies of others to investigate the generality of these processes. Here , we test for diversification within catchments in freshwater sculpins in a network of peri-Alpine lakes and streams. Using 8047 and 13 182 restriction site-associated ( RADseq) SNPs , respectively , we identify three deeply divergent phylogeographic lineages associated with different major European drainages. Within the Aare catchment , we observe populations from geographically distant lakes to be genetically more similar to each other than to populations from nearby streams. This pattern is consistent with two distinct colonization waves , rather than by parapatric ecological speciation after a single colonization wave. We further find two distinct depth distribution modes in three lakes of the Aare catchment , one in very shallow and one in very deep water , and significant genomewide differentiation between these in one lake. Sculpins in the Aare catchment appear to represent an early-stage adaptive radiation involving the evolution of a lacustrine lineage distinct from parapatric stream sculpins and the repeated onset of depth-related intralacustrine differentiation.
