  Excessive gestational weight gain increases risk of gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM) but it remains unclear whether weight control after GDM diagnosis improves outcomes. We assessed whether: ( 1) total gestational weight gain during pregnancy ( 0-36 weeks); ( 2) early gestational weight gain ( 0-28 weeks , before GDM diagnosis); or ( 3) late gestational weight gain ( 28-36 weeks , after diagnosis) are associated with maternal-fetal outcomes. Some 546 women with GDM who delivered viable singleton infants at a single UK obstetric centre ( October 2014 to March 2017) were included in this retrospective observational study. Higher total gestational weight gain was associated with Caesarean section ( n = 376; odds ratio ( OR) 1.05; confidence intervals ( CI) 1.02-1.08 , P < 0.001) and large for gestational age ( OR 1.08; CI 1.03-1.12 , P < 0.001). Higher late gestational weight gain ( 28-36 weeks; n = 144) was associated with large for gestational age ( OR 1.17; CI 1.01-1.37 , P < 0.05) , instrumental deliveries ( OR 1.26; CI 1.03-1.55 , P < 0.01) , higher total daily insulin doses ( 36 weeks; beta coefficient 4.37; CI 1.92-6.82 , P < 0.001) , and higher post-partum 2-h oral glucose tolerance test concentrations ( beta coefficient 0.12; CI 0.01-0.22 , P < 0.05). Women who avoided substantial weight gain after GDM diagnosis had 0.7 mmol/l lower postnatal 2-h glucose and needed half the amount of insulin/day at 36 weeks compared with women with substantial weight gain after diagnosis. There were no significant associations between early gestational weight gain ( 0-28 weeks) and pregnancy outcomes. These findings suggest that controlling gestational weight gain should be a priority following GDM diagnosis to optimize pregnancy outcomes and improve maternal postnatal glucose homeostasis. The period after diagnosis of GDM ( often 28 weeks gestation) is not too late to offer lifestyle advice or intervention to improve weight management and pregnancy outcomes.
