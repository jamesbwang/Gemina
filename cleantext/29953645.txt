  Long noncoding RNAs play essential roles in cancer development and progression. Here , we tried to investigate the role of GIHCG in the progression and metastasis of tongue squamous cell carcinoma ( TSCC). In our study , we showed that that the expression level of GIHCG was upregulated in TSCC tissues and cell lines. In addition , we indicated that high GIHCG expression was positively associated with poor overall survival. Moreover , ectopic expression of GIHCG enhanced TSCC cell cycle , proliferation , and migration. Elevated expression of GIHCG inhibited the miR-429 expression in TSCC cells. We demonstrated that the expression level of miR-429 was lower in TSCC tissues and cell lines. Low miR-429 expression was positively associated with poor overall survival. We then determined the correlation between miR-429 and GIHCG expression levels. A statistically significantly inverse correlation was observed between miR-429 and GIHCG expression levels in TSCC tissues. In addition , overexpression of miR-429 suppressed the TSCC cell cycle , proliferation , and migration. Elevated expression of GIHCG promoted TSCC cell cycle , proliferation , and migration through regulating miR-429 expression. These results suggested that GIHCG increased TSCC progression through negative modulation of miR-429. Our results suggested that GIHCG/miR -429 might play a vital role in TSCC progression.
