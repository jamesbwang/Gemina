  Pre-clinical evidence suggests delivery of nitric oxide ( NO) through administration of inorganic nitrite suppresses arrhythmias resulting from acute ischaemia and reperfusion ( I/R). To date no assessment of whether inorganic nitrite might limit reperfusion arrhythmia has occurred in man , therefore we explored the effects on I/R-induced ventricular arrhythmias in the NITRITE-AMI cohort. In the NITRITE-AMI cohort , Holter analysis was performed prior to and for 24 h after primary PCI in 80 patients who received either intra-coronary sodium nitrite ( N = 40) or placebo ( N = 40) during primary PCI for AMI. Ventricular rhythm disturbance was experienced by 100 % patients; however , there was no difference in the number between the groups , p = .2196. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia<symptom> ( NSVT) occurred in 67.5 % ( 27/40) of nitrite-treated patients compared to 89 % ( 35/39) of those treated with placebo ( p = .027). There was a significant reduction in both the number of runs ( 63 % , p â‰¤ .0001) and total beats of NSVT ( 64 % , p = .0019) in the nitrite-treated patients compared to placebo. Post-hoc analyses demonstrate a direct correlation of occurrence of NSVT with infarct size , with the correlation stronger in the placebo versus the nitrite group initiating an independent nitrite effect ( Nitrite: r = 0.110 , p = .499 , placebo: r = 0.527 , p = .001 , p for comparison: 0.004). Overall no difference in ventricular rhythm disturbance was seen with intra-coronary nitrite treatment during primary PCI in STEMI patients , however nitrite treatment was associated with an important reduction in the incidence and severity of NSVT. In view of the sustained reduction of MACE seen , this effect warrants further study in a large-scale trial.
