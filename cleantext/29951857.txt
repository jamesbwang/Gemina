  Inteins , also known as `` protein introns , '' have been found to be present in many microbial species and widely employed for the expression and purification of recombinant proteins in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> However , interestingly , until now there has not been much information on the identification and application of inteins to protein expression in Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> In this article , for the first time , despite the likelihood of absence of inteins in B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> , this bacterium<pathogen> was shown to be able to facilitate auto-catalytic cleavages of fusions formed between inteins and recombinant proteins. Employing a construct expressing the intein , Ssp DnaB , ( DnaB) , which was fused at its N-terminus with the cellulose-binding domain ( CellBD) of an endoglucanase encoded by the cenA gene of Cellulomonas<pathogen> fimi , the construct was demonstrated to be capable of mediating intracellular expression of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF) , followed by auto-processing of the CellBD-DnaB-bFGF fusion to result in bFGF possessing the 146-residue authentic structure. The mentioned fusion was shown to result in a high yield of 84 mg l
