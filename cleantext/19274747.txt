  The effect of implanting a β-TCP bioceramic rod system ( BRS) can be observed with using the 3-dimensional ( 3D) finite-element method on the biomechanics of early-stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( ONFH) , to provide a theoretical basis for the biomechanics of applying the β-TCP BRS in the treatment of ONFH.A healthy 172 cm tall male adult volunteer ( age: 40 years , weight: 70 kg , and femoral diameter: 50 mm) was selected for this study. The volunteer had no history of diseases in the hip , lower back , and lower limbs. He also had no history of trauma and surgery and had no lesions<symptom> in the femoral head.A finite-element model of the normal proximal femur was constructed , and on this basis , 4 ONFH finite-element models were constructed , which had 15 % and 30 % necrotic areas in the superolateral area and 2 and 4 mm collapse in the weight-bearing area of the femoral head , respectively.This process was followed by simulated implantation of the β-TCP BRS in the finite-element models of the femoral head. Changes in the stress and displacement of the femoral head were observed before and after treatment with the β-TCP BRS , and the risk of femoral-head collapse was assessed.Under an applied walking load , the stress concentration on the femoral head was alleviated after treatment. Moreover , the stress and collapse values of the weight-bearing area decreased compared with those before treatment , and the differences were statistically significant ( P < .05); the risk of collapse was also lower than that before treatment. As the area of the necrosis<symptom> increased , the collapse value also increased , and the risk of collapse increased. More severe preoperative collapse implied that a greater risk of postoperative recollapse exists.This case report was written for 4 purposes: Implantation of the β-TCP BRS could effectively improve the internal mechanical properties of ONFH , enhance the support capacity of bones in the weight-bearing area in ONFH , reduce the compressive stress on the necrotic bone , and lower the risk of collapse in ONFH.
