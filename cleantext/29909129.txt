  This essay focuses on transmissible gastroenteritis<disease> virus ( TGEV) , which is an enteropathogenic virus related to contagious and acute diseases in suckling piglets. Previous literature suggests that the TGEV nucleocapsid protein ( N) plays a significant role in viral transcriptional process , however , there is a need to examine other functions of TGEV N protein in the porcine intestinal epithelial cell ( IEC) which is the target cell of TGEV. In the present study , we investigated the degradation , subcellular localisation , and function of TGEV N protein by examining its effects on cycle progression , endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) stress , interleukin-8 ( IL-8) expression , and cell survival. The results showed that TGEV N protein localised in the cytoplasm , inhibited IEC growth , prolonged the S-phase cell cycle by down-regulating cell cycle protein cyclin A , and was mainly degraded through the proteasome pathway. Moreover , TGEV N protein induced ER stress and activated NF-ÎºB , which was responsible for the up-regulation of IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression. This report mainly considers the functions of TGEV N protein in IEC. To be specific , in IEC , TGEV N protein induces cell cycle prolongation at the S-phase , ER stress and up-regulates IL-8 expression. These results provide a better understanding of the functions and structural mechanisms of TGEV N protein.
