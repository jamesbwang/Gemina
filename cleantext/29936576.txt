  The plant hormone `` auxin '' is a key regulator of plant development and environmental responses. Many genes in Arabidopsis thaliana are known to be up-regulated in response to auxin. Auxin response factors activate or repress the expression of genes by binding at their promoter regions within auxin response elements ( AuxRE) that are key regulatory cis-acting motives. Therefore , the identification of auxin-response elements is among the most important issues to understand the auxin regulation mechanisms. Thus , searching the TGTCTC motif is an unreliable method to identify AuxRE because many AuxRE variants may also be functional. In the present study , we perform an In-silico prediction of AuxREs in promoters of primary auxin responsive genes. We exploit microarray data of auxin response in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings , in order to provide biological annotation to AuxRE. We apply a data fusion method based on the combined use of evidence theory and fuzzy sets to scan upstream sequences of response genes.
