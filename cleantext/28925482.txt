  Oncogenes derived from the neurotrophin receptor tropomyosin-related kinase TrkA act as drivers in sub-populations of a wide-range of human cancers. This , combined with a recent report that both adult and childhood cancers driven by novel oncogenic TrkA chimeric-fusions exhibit profound , long-lived therapeutic responses to the Trk inhibitor Larotrectinib , highlights the need to improve clinical detection of TrkA oncogene-driven cancers in order to maximise this novel therapeutic potential. Cancers potentially driven by TrkA oncogenes include a proportion of paediatric neuroblastomas ( NBs) that express the alternative TrkA splice variant TrkAIII , which exhibits exon 6 , 7 and 9 skipping and oncogenic-activity that depends upon deletion of the extracellular D4 Ig-like domain. In contrast to fully spliced TrkA , which exhibits tumour suppressor activity in NB and associates with good prognosis , TrkAIII associates with advanced stage metastatic disease , post therapeutic relapse and worse prognosis , induces malignant transformation of NIH-3T3 cells and exhibits oncogenic activity in NB models. TrkAIII induction in NB cells is stress-regulated by conditions that mimic hypoxia or perturbate the ER with potential to change TrkA tumour-suppressing signals into oncogenic TrkAIII signals within the stressful tumour microenvironment. In contrast to cell surface TrkA , TrkAIII re-localises to intracellular pre-Golgi membranes<symptom> , centrosomes and mitochondria , within which it exhibits spontaneous ligand-independent activation , triggering a variety of mechanisms that promote tumorigenicity and malignant behaviour , which impact the majority of cancer hallmarks. In this review , we present updates on TrkAIII detection and association with human malignancies , the multiple ways TrkAIII exerts oncogenic activity and potential therapeutic approaches for TrkAIII expressing cancers , with particular reference to NB.
