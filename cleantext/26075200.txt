  We have developed a three-dimensional structure database of natural metabolites ( 3DMET). Early development of the 3DMET database relied on content auto-generated from 2D-structures of other chemical databases. From 2009 , we began manual curation , obtaining new compounds from published works. In the process of curation , problems of digitizing 3D-structures from structure drawings of documents were accumulated. As the same as auto-generation , structure drawings should be also payed attention about stereochemistry. Our experiences in manual curation of 3DMET , as described herein , may be useful to others in this field of research and for the development of supporting systems of a chemical structure database. Manual curation is still necessary for proper database entry of the 3D-configurations of chiral atoms , a problem encountered frequently among natural products.
