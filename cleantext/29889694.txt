  Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) and primary Sj√∂gren 's syndrome<disease> ( pSS) share several clinical and laboratory features , including an overexpression of type I interferon ( IFN) regulated genes. The genetic background to this IFN signature and the role of the type I IFN system in the disease process have been partly clarified. Here , we summarize the latest information concerning the type I IFN system in both diseases. A number of gene variants in the type I IFN signalling pathways associate with an increased risk for both SLE and pSS in several ethnicities. The function of some risk gene variants has been elucidated , as well as the importance of epigenetic changes in type I IFN regulated genes. MicroRNA-451 and miR-302d have been shown to target IFN regulatory factor 8 and 9 , suggesting that noncoding RNAs can control the IFN system. A prominent type I IFN activation is related to several disease manifestations , and in SLE to a more severe disease phenotype. Phase II studies in SLE suggest beneficial effects of blocking the type I IFN receptor. The activated type I IFN system in SLE and pSS has a strong genetic component , is important in the disease etiopathogenesis and can be targeted.
