  To measure skin thickness ( ST) and skin + subcutaneous layer thickness ( SCT) by ultrasound and estimate the risk of intramuscular injection ( IM) with different needle lengths across injection sites according to age group. Children recruited between 1 and 18 years with type 1 and 2 diabetes on insulin injections and divided into three age groups: 1-6 years , 7-12 years and 13-18 years. A portable ultrasound was used to measure ST and SCT at four injection sites on the abdomen , arm , thigh and buttock. Total 153 children enrolled for the study. The mean ( SD) measurement of ST & SCT at four sites on abdomen , arm , thigh & buttocks were as follows; 4.33 mm ( ± 2.22) , 5.55 mm ( ± 2.26) , 5.83 mm ( ± 3.12) , 6.48 mm ( ± 3.47) in 1-6 years old; 7.11 mm ( ± 3.68) , 7.79 mm ( ± 4.54) , 7.17 mm ( ± 3.62) , 8.51 mm ( ± 3.65) in 7-12 years old; 8.94 mm ( ± 4.50) , 8.42 mm ( ± 5.00) , 8.61 mm ( ± 4.76) , 9.76 mm ( ± 4.38) in 13-18 years old. Young children , 1-6 years have the highest risk of IM injection with all needle lengths , i.e. 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 & 12.7 mm , while older children 7-12 & 13-18 years have a lower risk with shorter needles ( 4 , 5 and 6 mm) as compared to longer needles ( 8 and 12.7 mm). Children with diabetes on insulin therapy should be advised on the appropriate needle length accordingly to their age and BMI.
