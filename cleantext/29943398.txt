  Marine habitats represent a prolific source for molecules of biotechnological interest. In particular , marine bacteria have attracted attention and were successfully exploited for industrial applications. Recently , a group of Pseudomonas<pathogen> species isolated from extreme habitats or living in association with algae<pathogen> or sponges were clustered in the newly established Pseudomonas<pathogen> pertucinogena<pathogen> lineage. Remarkably for the predominantly terrestrial genus Pseudomonas , more than half ( 9) of currently 16 species within this lineage were isolated from marine or saline habitats. Unlike other Pseudomonas<pathogen> species , they seem to have in common a highly specialized metabolism. Furthermore , the marine members apparently possess the capacity to produce biomolecules of biotechnological interest ( e.g. dehalogenases , polyester hydrolases , transaminases). Here , we summarize the knowledge regarding the enzymatic endowment of the marine Pseudomonas<pathogen> pertucinogena<pathogen> bacteria and report on a genomic analysis focusing on the presence of genes encoding esterases , dehalogenases , transaminases and secondary metabolites including carbon storage compounds.
