  Polymer zwitterions were synthesized by nucleophilic ring-opening of 3,3 '- ( but-2-ene-1,4-diyl) bis ( 1,2-oxathiolane 2,2-dioxide) ( a bis-sultone) with functional perylene diimide ( PDI) or fullerene monomers. Integration of these polymers into solar cell devices as cathode interlayers boosted efficiencies of fullerene-based organic photovoltaics ( OPVs) from 2.75 % to 10.74 % , and of non-fullerene-based OPVs from 4.25 % to 10.10 % , demonstrating the versatility of these interlayer materials in OPVs. The fullerene-containing polymer zwitterion ( C
