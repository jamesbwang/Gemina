  We investigate in detail the process of formation of the multipeak low-temperature structure in the behavior of the specific heat capacity in frustrated magnetic systems in the framework of the exactly solvable antiferromagnetic spin-1/ 2 Ising model with the multisite interaction in the presence of the external magnetic field on the kagome-like Husimi lattice. The behavior of the entropy of the model is studied and exact values of the residual entropies of all ground states are found. It is shown that the multipeak structure in the behavior of the specific heat capacity is related to the formation of the multilevel hierarchical ordering in the system of all ground states of the model. Direct relation between the maximal number of peaks in the specific heat capacity behavior and the number of independent interactions in studied frustrated magnetic system is identified. The mechanism of the formation of the multipeak structure in the specific heat capacity is described and studied in detail , and it is generalized to frustrated magnetic systems with arbitrary numbers of independent interactions.
