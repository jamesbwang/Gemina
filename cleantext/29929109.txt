  Epilepsy surgery has been shown to be effective in treating focal epilepsy related to tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC). We analyzed the advantage of early surgical management in terms of seizure<symptom> frequency and development. We retrospectively studied the 15 patients younger than 6 years who underwent resective surgery between 2006 and 2016. Fourteen of them had invasive monitoring while the 15th was operated on under corticography. Epilepsy began before 5 months of age in all patients. Overall 13 patients ( 86 %) had a dramatic improvement of epilepsy after surgery ( Engel 1 and 2) including 9 patients ( 60 %) seizure<symptom> free ( Engel 1 A). In the group of 9 patients younger than 20 months at the time of surgery who presented with catastrophic epilepsies , 77 % are Engel 1 A and the other 23 % Engel 2. In this subpopulation , no one developed autism and four ( 44 %) regained normal development. In early onset epilepsies associated with TSC , surgical treatment is highly effective , in particular when performed early. Invasive monitoring contributes to the successful outcome. Those data have to be confirmed by multicentric studies including quantitative analyses of the recordings.
