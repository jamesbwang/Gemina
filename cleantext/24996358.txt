  Physicochemical , antioxidant , phenolic profile and muffin-making properties of white , yellow and purple corn accessions were evaluated. HPLC analysis revealed the presence of ferulic acid , quercetin , sinapic acid , gallic acid and protocatechuic acid in different corn accessions. Ferulic acid was the major phenolic acid present in all accessions. Total phenolic content ( TPC) , DPPH and ABTS inhibition ranged from 903 to 1843 µg GAE/g , 0.73-0.89 and 3.81-4.92 µM trolox/mg , respectively. Purple accessions had higher TPC than yellow and white accessions. Pasting profiles of different accessions revealed high thermal stability indicated by low breakdown viscosity. Muffin-making properties were determined as batter rheology and muffin specific volume , texture and sensory analysis. Storage modulus (
