  Minimal hepatic encephalopathy ( MHE) , a complex neuropsychological complication of cirrhosis , is characterized by delayed reaction time and the inhibition of abnormal response. This network meta-analysis ( NMA) was adopted to compare the efficacy of five drugs including lactulose , probiotics , rifaximin , acetyl-L-carnitine ( ALC) , and L-Ornithine L-aspartate ( LOLA) in the treatment of MHE. The Cochrane Library , PubMed , and Embase databases were searched for any existing entail on these five drugs from the inception to February 2018 , including Randomized controlled trials ( RCTs). The NMA of the five drugs , accounting for both direct and indirect comparisons to assess WMD ( weighted mean difference) and SUCRA ( surface under the cumulative ranking curves) was conducted. In total , 10 RTCS with 826 MHE patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the NMA. The meta-analysis revealed that compared with placebo , lactulose , and probiotics had better efficacy in reducing ammonia<pathogen> serum levels and total SIP ( Sickness Impact Profil) score; ALC had better efficacy in lowering serum level of ammonia<pathogen> and increasing the serum level of albumin; rifaximin and LOLA had better efficacy in reducing total SIP score. The results from SUCRA revealed that in terms of ammonia<pathogen> and albumin serums , ALC presented with the highest rankings when it comes to efficacy ( serum ammonia<pathogen> 87.2 %; serum albumin: 92.25 %). Hence , the key findings from the present study highly suggested that ALC had the best efficacy in the treatment of MHE patients.
