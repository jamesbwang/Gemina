  The relative age effect ( RAE) has been found among youth elite athletes within a range of sports. However , the RAE has been studied to a lesser degree among youth non-elite athletes , and even less among school pupils attending sport specialisation programmes ( SSPs). The aim of the present study was to investigate RAE , height , and weight , and compare Swedish lower secondary school and Norwegian upper secondary school pupils. Study 1 includes 156 lower secondary school athletes ( 95 boys and 61 girls) following an SSP in Sweden , while study 2 includes 111 upper secondary school athletes ( 81 boys and 30 girls) from two Norwegian schools. The RAE was found in both male groups , but only in Swedish girls. Furthermore , the relationship between birth month , height , and weight was found to be non-significant. These results indicate a vital RAE effect among youth non-elite athletes attending SSPs in both lower and upper secondary schools.
