  Status epilepticus is a medical emergency with elevated morbidity and mortality rates , and represents a leading cause of epilepsy-related deaths. Though status epilepticus can occur at any age , it manifests more likely in children and elderly people. Despite the common prevalence of epileptic disorders , a complete explanation for the mechanisms leading to development of self-limited or long lasting seizures<symptom> ( as in status epilepticus) are still lacking. Apart from neurons , research evidence suggests the involvement of immune and glial cells in epileptogenesis. Among glial cells , astrocytes represent an ideal target for the study of the pathophysiology of status epilepticus , due to their key role in homeostatic balance<symptom> of the central nervous system. During status epilepticus , astroglial cells are activated by the presence of cytokines , damage associated molecular patterns and reactive oxygen species. The persistent activation of astrocytes leads to a decrease in glutamate clearance with a corresponding accumulation in the synaptic extracellular space , increasing the chance of neuronal excitotoxicity. Moreover , major alterations in astrocytic gap junction coupling , inflammation<symptom> and receptor expression , facilitate the generation of seizures<symptom>. Astrocytes are also involved in dysregulation of inhibitory transmission in the central nervous system and directly participate in ionic homeostatic alterations during status epilepticus. In the present review , we focus on the functional and structural changes in astrocytic activity that participate in the development and maintenance of status epilepticus , with special attention on concurrent inflammatory alterations. We also include potential astrocytic treatment targets for status epilepticus.
