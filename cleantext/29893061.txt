  The study of sensory structures has the potential to provide insights into the natural history and evolution of animals. The sensory structures of arachnids are usually concentrated on the pedipalps ( the tritocerebral appendages) or on the distal podomere ( tarsus) of the anterior walking legs , the latter being the case for armored harvestmen ( Opiliones , Laniatores). Therefore , modifications of the tarsus could have direct impacts on the sensory equipment of these animals. Using scanning electron microscopy , we investigated the sensory equipment in an extreme case of reduction in tarsal articles in the harvestman Sandokan truncatus ( Sandokanidae) , which bears a single tarsomere in all legs , and the potential consequences of this reduction. Additionally , we review the literature on the natural history of the family Sandokanidae. Tarsomeres of all legs are equipped with gustatory sensilla , mechanoreceptors , and a pore organ , but wall-pored olfactory sensilla are restricted to tarsi I and II. Tarsi II present a higher density of olfactory sensilla and also putative campaniform sensilla ( strain detectors) , which indicates a special sensory function of this pair of legs. Other podomeres are covered with shelled sensilla , a probable chemoreceptor previously unreported in Opiliones. Overall , S. truncatus has types of sensilla largely comparable to harvestmen with longer and subdivided tarsi. However , S. truncatus also exhibits extra-tarsal sensory fields of sensilla basiconica ( putative thermo-/ hygroreceptors) in previously undescribed sites , and the unique pore organs. Our results establish a basis for further research investigating the natural history , as well as the evolutionary correlations and mechanistic causes of the tarsal reduction in this enigmatic lineage.
