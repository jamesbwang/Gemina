  We examined whether not having been asked by their clinicians about how involved cancer patients would like to be in their treatment decisions is related to discordance between patients ' preferred and perceived involvement in treatment decision-making. This was a cross-sectional survey of adult cancer patients recruited from five medical and radiation oncology outpatient clinics in Australia. Discordance of patients ' preferred and perceived decision-making roles was assessed via an adapted version of the Control Preferences Scale. Logistic regression modelling was conducted to assess the relationship between role discordance and whether patients were not asked but wanted to be asked about how involved they would like to be in deciding on their treatment. Of 423 study participants , almost a third ( n = 128 , 31 %) reported discordance between their preferred and perceived involvement in their treatment decisions. Of those reporting discordance , 72 % ( n = 92) were less involved than they would have liked to have been. Not being asked about their preferences for involvement in treatment decisions , despite wanting this , was associated with discordance between patients ' preferred and perceived involvement in treatment decision-making ( p < 0.04). To achieve patient-centred care , it is vital that clinicians seek patients ' views about how involved they would like to be in deciding on their cancer treatment.
