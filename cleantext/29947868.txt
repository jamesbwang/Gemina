  In community dwelling , 75-year-old women followed 10 years , a frailty index was created at each of three visits. Frailty score increased by ~ 6-7 % annually. A higher frailty score was equivalent to being 5-10 years chronologically older. Frailty was associated with low bone density and higher risk of dying. To understand the distribution of frailty among a population-based sample of older community-dwelling women , progression over 10 years , and association with mortality and osteoporosis. The study is performed in a cohort designed to investigate osteoporosis. The OPRA cohort consists of 75-year-old women , n = 1044 at baseline , and follow-up at age 80 and 85. A frailty index ( scored from 0.0-1.0) based on deficits in health across multiple domains was created at all time-points; outcomes were mortality up to 15 years and femoral neck bone density. At baseline , the proportion least frail , i.e. , most robust ( FI 0.0-0.1) constituted 48 % , dropping to 25 and 14 % at age 80 and 85. On average , over 10 years , the annual linear frailty score progression was approximately 6-7 %. Among the least frail , 11 % remained robust over 10 years. A higher frailty score was equivalent to being 5 to 10 years older. Mortality was substantially higher in the highest quartile compared to the lowest based on baseline frailty score; after 10 years , 48.7 % had died vs 17.2 % ( p = 1.7 Ã— 10 The frailty index was highly predictive of mortality showing a threefold increased risk of death in the frailest both in a shorter and longer perspective. Only one in ten older women escaped progression after 10 years. Frailty and osteoporosis were associated.
