  Adoptive cell therapy ( ACT) of chimeric antigen receptor T cells has demonstrated remarkable success for the treatment of pediatric B-cell leukemia<disease>. For patients who are not candidates for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy , ACT using tumor antigen-experienced polyclonal T cells may be a treatment option. Since leukemic blasts reside in the bone<disease> marrow and bone<disease> marrow is a preferred site for homeostatic proliferation of cytotoxic memory CD8 T cells , we hypothesized that bone<disease> marrow would be a source of activated T cells. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of using bone marrow-derived T cells following postinduction chemotherapy for use in adoptive cell transfer. Matched patient samples of bone<disease> marrow and peripheral blood-derived T cells expanded ex vivo and displayed similar apoptotic profiles. Before activation and expansion , there was a significant increase in the percentage of bone marrow-derived CD8 T cells expressing activation markers PD1 , CD45RO , and CD69 as compared with peripheral blood CD8 T cells. Considering , melanoma-reactive CD8 T cells reside in the subset of PD1CD8 T cells , the bone<disease> marrow may be an enriched source leukemic-specific T cells that can be used for ACT.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
