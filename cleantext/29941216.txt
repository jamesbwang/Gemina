  Chondromalacia of the tracheal and bronchial cartilages and redundancy of the dorsal tracheal membrane result in collapse of the large airways , leading to coughing and airway obstruction. It most commonly affects small-breed dogs , although larger-breed dogs , cats , and miniature horses are also sporadically reported. Dynamic airway imaging is used to confirm the diagnosis. The primary goal of medical management is to control clinical signs attributable to coughing and airway inflammation<symptom>. When this is no longer effective , tracheal stents provide a minimally invasive , rapid way to restore airway patency. Bronchial stenting is in its infancy in veterinary medicine.
