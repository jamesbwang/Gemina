  Amoxicillin ( AMX) , a widely used beta-lactam antibiotic , belongs to the World Health Organization 's list of essential medicines. This subsequently causes its long-term presence in the environment and therefore , affects different environmental compartments. In this research , the degradation and mineralisation of AMX by UVC-activated persulfate-based treatment in various aqueous media was assessed. The degradation of the target compound was in accordance with the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics in all the UVC-induced systems. The results indicated that AMX degradation in any real water matrices is notably inhibited by the matrix properties. The trials with radical scavengers in ultrapure water proved the existence of ( Formula: see text) and HO
