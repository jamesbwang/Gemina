  To explore the efficacy and patterns of treatment failure of radical radiotherapy in newly diagnosed oligo-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. We included 39 newly diagnosed oligo-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who received radical radiotherapy and chemotherapy in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. Treatment and prognosis information were collected. The Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate survival rates and analyze prognostic factors. After a median follow-up time of 38 months , the 1- , 3- , and 5-year overall survival rates were 97 , 70 , and 57.9 % , while the 1- , 3- , and 5-year progression-free survival rates were 87 , 59 , and 50.9 % , respectively. Age , numbers of metastases lesions<symptom> , cycles , and schemes of chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors of the overall survival. Patients with no more than three metastasis lesions<symptom> had a higher survival rate than those with â‰¥ 3 metastatic lesions<symptom> ( P = 0.023). More than four cycles chemotherapy provide a higher survival rate than less than four cycles. Chemotherapy including docetaxel had a significantly survival advantages ( P = 0.041). Radical radiotherapy is important for newly diagnosed oligo-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients , which can still achieve long-term survival after chemo-radiotherapy.
