  Vascularized lymph node transfer is a promising surgical treatment for lymphedema. This study investigates the effect of ischemia on the lymphatic drainage efficiency of vascularized lymph node flaps and the critical ischemia time of lymph nodes. Twenty-four lymph nodes containing groin flaps in twelve Sprague-Dawley rats were dissected. Clamping of the vascular pedicle was performed for 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 hours , then each allowed to re-perfuse via the vascular pedicle for one hour. Perfusion and ischemic changes were assessed using indocyanine green lymphography , laser Doppler flowmetry , and histological studies with associated LYVE-1 , CD68 , DAPI , TUNEL and GSH assay stains. The mean latency period of the groin lymph node flaps was 247 ± 67 , 83 ± 15 , 72 ± 42 , 30 ± 18 , and 245 ± 85 seconds in the 0- , 1- , 3- , 5- and 6-hour groups , respectively. Perfusion detected by laser Doppler was 85.2 ± 14.5 , 87.2 ± 36.7 , 129.8 ± 33.7 , 140.4 ± 148.5 , 156.1 ± 91.4 and 41.2 ± 34.8 perfusion units at ischemia times of 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , and 7 hours , respectively. Cell damage measured by glutathione was 46.8 ± 10.2 , 67.7 ± 14.2 , 62.8 ± 15.4 , 126.6 ± 5.9 , 259.0 ± 70.3 , and 109.1 ± 27.5 at ischemia times of 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , and 7 hours , respectively. Histologically , as ischemia time increased , hemorrhage<symptom> and congestion<symptom> became more severe. The critical ischemia time of vascularized lymph nodes is five hours in the rodent animal model , verified by ICG lymphatic fluid uptake , laser Doppler perfusion , and histologic assessments. Interestingly , lymphatic drainage and perfusion of vascularized lymph nodes were improved with an increased ischemia time before the critical five hours was reached.
