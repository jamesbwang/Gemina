  Toxicity of antimony ( Sb) to humans may occur through environmental , occupational , and therapeutic exposures. The underlying mechanism of its accumulation in red blood cells ( RBCs) is not clear. Here , the processes and mechanism of RBCs sequestering Sb were explored through a series of in vitro and in vivo studies. These include binding affinity of Sb compounds with rat hemoglobin ( Hb) and RBCs , acute exposure of antimony potassium tartrate ( APT
