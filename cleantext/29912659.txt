  This study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of the perspectives and life experiences of adolescents living with obesity. Five adolescents living with obesity were involved in repeated interviews , and qualitative content analysis was performed. Three themes emerged: obesity as a multi-faceted and difficult to solve condition; obesity as a shameful and vulnerable subject; and bullying and fragile social relationships. Adolescents living with obesity described everyday life challenges as difficult to interpret and solve. Adolescents living with obesity perceived causes for obesity differently , and those who emphasised familial determinants seemed to face greater challenges. Lack of support from parents , trusted friends and health-care providers and bullying , shame , guilt and self-blame represented threats that decreased motivation for help seeking and successful life-style changes. The adolescents were ambivalent regarding disclosing their concerns and seeking help. The adolescents feared that health care providers would demand too much from them , and peers were perceived as a possible source of support. Care providers need to be skilled in assessing each individual 's resources and interpretations of their condition , to be able to communicate in a respectful , patient-centred manner and to assist adolescents to explore their ambivalence and set their own realistic goals. More research is needed.
