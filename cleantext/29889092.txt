  The aim of this work is to estimate leisure-time physical activity ( LTPA) of the professionally-active population as a factor in early preventive medicine and diagnosing threats of occupational diseases. It was the basis for an analysis of the realisation of a pro-health dose of physical activity recommended by WHO ( depending on the profession). A survey based on IPAQ-LV was realised in 2014-2015 on a representative sample of Poles ( n = 2039). The work presents results for professionally-active people ( n = 985). In order to verify statistically significant differences a Chi2 , U-Mann Whitney and Kruskall-Wallis H tests were implemented. LTPA Index for the whole group was 895.6 ± 1514.3 MET-minutes/week. No statistical relationship was found between the survey wave and the LTPA factor and particular activities: VPA , MPA and walking. The LTPA value was significantly related ( Chi2 = 19.9; p < 0.001) to the profession. LTPA Index was highest among the higher social stratification groups ( directors/managers/owners: 1492.7 ± 2348.1 , higher level office workers: 957.6 ± 1268.3 , other office workers: 973.0 ± 1677.5 MET-minutes/week) and the lowest among skilled workers ( 744.8 ± 1325.8 MET-minutes/week). As many as 61.1 % of respondents did not meet WHO recommendations. During week days , the greatest time spent sitting ( Chi2 = 0.000; p < 0.05) was stated for higher level office workers ( 6.4 ± 4.2 hours/day) and directors/managers/owners ( 5.0 ± 4.0 hours/day). Sitting time for weekends was not significantly different for these groups. Activities promoting LTPA should be addressed to all professional groups. It is essential to inform workers ( especially physical workers) about the role of properly selected physical activity ( in terms of time , frequency and type) to maintain a good state of health. A model-shaping influence of the high prestige groups may be helpful in changing lifestyle.
