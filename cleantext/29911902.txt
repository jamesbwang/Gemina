  CD133 ( prominin-1) , a pentaspan membrane glycoprotein , is one of the most well-characterized biomarkers used for the isolation of cancer stem cells ( CSCs). The presence of CSCs is one of the main causes of tumour reversal and resilience. Accumulating evidence has shown that CD133 might be responsible for CSCs tumourigenesis , metastasis and chemoresistance. It is now understood that CD133 interacts with the Wnt/Î²-catenin and PI3K-Akt signalling pathways. Moreover , CD133 can upregulate the expression of the FLICE-like inhibitory protein ( FLIP) in CD133-positive cells , inhibiting apoptosis. In addition , CD133 can increase angiogenesis by activating the Wnt signalling pathway and increasing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A ( VEGF-A) and interleukin-8. Therefore , CD133 could be considered to be an ` Achilles ' heel ' for CSCs , because by inhibiting this protein , the signalling pathways that are involved in cell proliferation will also be inhibited. By understanding the molecular biology of CD133 , we can not only isolate stem cells but can also utilise it as a therapeutic strategy. In this review , we summarise new insights into the fundamental cell biology of CD133 and discuss the involvement of CD133 in metastasis , metabolism , tumourigenesis , drug-resistance , apoptosis and autophagy.
