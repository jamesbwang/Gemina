  Background Vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM) is commonly performed to ensure safe and effective use of the antibiotic. Aim of Study To evaluate appropriateness of vancomycin TDM and its outcomes in Singapore General Hospital. Method A retrospective , cross-sectional study was conducted between 1 January 2014 and 28 February 2014 involving patients who received â‰¥ 1 dose of intravenous vancomycin with TDM. Patient demographics and relevant vancomycin TDM data were collected from medical records. Results Of 746 vancomycin troughs measured among 234 patients , 459 troughs ( 61.5 %) were taken inappropriately , with a median time of 2.6 h ( interquartile range 1.1-4.3) before the next scheduled dose. Inappropriate interpretation of vancomycin troughs resulted in 41 unnecessary dose suspensions , 24 dose changes , and 102 unchanged vancomycin doses. The cost incurred due to inappropriate interpretation and measurement after discontinuation of treatment was US$ 7286. No differences in rates of vancomycin related nephrotoxicity , ototoxicity , recurrent infection , development of infection secondary to vancomycin resistant microorganism and mortality were observed ( p > 0.05). Conclusion This study highlighted a high incidence of inappropriate vancomycin TDM which has led to increased healthcare cost.
