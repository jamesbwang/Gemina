  This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab combined with chemotherapy as first-line therapy in advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma ( LSCC) , and to explore predictive biomarkers of the efficacy of nimotuzumab. A retrospective study was conducted of patients with advanced LSCC administered nimotuzumab combined with chemotherapy as first-line therapy from June 2012 to December 2016 at the Department of Respiratory Medicine , Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The associations between EGFR expression , EGFR gene copy numbers , and clinical efficacy were detected by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH). Twenty-six patients were enrolled , including 22 men and 4 women. The objective response rate was 50 % and the disease control rate was 100 %. The median progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival were 6.7 and 16.3 months , respectively. Patients whose samples were tested via FISH and showed positive EGFR expression had a trend of longer median PFS ( 10.0 months; P = 0.10). Adverse effects included 15 cases ( 57.7 %) of bone<disease> marrow suppression , 15 ( 57.7 %) of sensory neuropathy , 14 ( 53.8 %) of alopecia , nine ( 34.6 %) of nausea/vomiting and one case ( 3.8 %) of elevated creatinine level. All adverse effects were attributed to chemotherapy. Nimotuzumab combined with chemotherapy might be a possible option as first-line therapy in patients with advanced LSCC. EGFR gene copy number examined by FISH might be a possible predictive biomarker.
