  Oligomeric amyloid structures are crucial therapeutic targets in Alzheimer 's and other amyloid diseases. However , these oligomers are too small to be resolved by standard light microscopy. We have developed a simple and versatile tool to image amyloid structures using Thioflavin T without the need for covalent labeling or immunostaining. Dynamic binding of single dye molecules generates photon bursts that are used for fluorophore localization on a nanometer scale. Thus , photobleaching can not degrade image quality , allowing for extended observation times. Super-resolution Transient Amyloid Binding ( TAB) microscopy promises to directly image native amyloid using standard probes and record amyloid dynamics over minutes to days. We imaged amyloid fibrils from multiple polypeptides , oligomeric , and fibrillar structures formed during different stages of amyloid-β aggregation , as well as the structural remodeling of amyloid-β fibrils by the compound epi-gallocatechin gallate ( EGCG).
