  There is increasing evidence in humans and laboratory animals for biologically based sex differences in every phase of drug addiction: acute reinforcing effects , transition from occasional to compulsive use , withdrawal-associated negative affective states , craving , and relapse. There is also evidence that many qualitative aspects of the addiction phases do not differ significantly between males and females , but one sex may be more likely to exhibit a trait than the other , resulting in population differences. The conceptual framework of this review is to focus on hormonal , chromosomal , and epigenetic organizational and contingent , sex-dependent mechanisms of four neural systems that are known-primarily in males-to be key players in addiction: dopamine , mu-opioid receptors ( MOR) , kappa opioid receptors ( KOR) , and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF). We highlight data demonstrating sex differences in development , expression , and function of these neural systems as they relate-directly or indirectly-to processes of reward and addictive behavior , with a focus on psychostimulants and opioids. We identify gaps in knowledge about how these neural systems interact with sex to influence addictive behavior , emphasizing throughout that the impact of sex can be highly nuanced and male/female data should be reported regardless of the outcome.
