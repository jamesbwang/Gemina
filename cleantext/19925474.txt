  Ageing is defined as the progressive decline in tissue and organ functions over time. This study aims to evaluate the ageing effect on cultured pearl quality phenotypes ( including size and quality traits) in the graft-recipient animal model: Pinctada margaritifera. For this , eight uniform grafting experiments were designed using two hatchery-produced pearl oyster families as donors , which were followed through time , between 7 and 30 months in age. For each age category , 20 donors were studied for each culture site giving a total of 2400 grafted oysters. Several phenotypic measurements were made: 1) donor family growth performance from shell size records , 2) pearl size and corresponding quality traits , and 3) expression of some genes related to biomineralization processes on both the mantle graft and on pearl sac tissues. Results showed that: 1) donor age has an impact on pearl size , with grafts coming from the youngest donors yielding the biggest pearls; and 2) grafts from donors between 12 and 18 months in age produced pearls of the highest quality ( grade and surface quality) , a result supported by an analysis where the level of expression for a panel of genes associated with biomineralization was greatest in donors within the 12 to 18 months age group. These results indicate that donors aged between 12 and 18 months have high potential for biomineralisation and nacre deposition , and likely produce larger and higher quality cultured pearls than older donors.
