  Infantile haemangioma is the most common childhood vascular tumour , which causes great anxiety<symptom> to parents and treating first-line physicians due to its proliferative nature. It accounts for a large percentage of a tertiary centre consultations , thus delaying consultation time for patients in need of immediate care. Review of literature and experience of treatment and observation of infantile haemangiomas in a tertiary centre of paediatric surgery. Based on the gathered information , we established an observation guideline of infantile haemangiomas for first-line physicians. First-line physicians must recognise the infantile haemangioma that requires immediate referral to a tertiary centre in order to prevent the appearance of associated complications. The remaining population of the patients of infantile haemangioma can be actively monitored once a month for at least a year by the treating pediatrician or family doctor. New and easy to use protocoled diagnostic tests such as thermography would greatly benefit first-line and tertiary-centre physicians in the follow-up of infantile haemangiomas.
