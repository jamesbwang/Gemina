  Adiponectin ( ApN) is a hormone produced by adipose tissue , yet the plasma level of ApN is decreased in overweight and obese people , as well as in people with diabetes. In the periphery , this decrease in circulating levels of ApN induces the establishment of a chronic low-grade inflammatory state and is involved in the development of insulin resistance and atheromas. Conversely , `` favorable '' living conditions , weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and regular physical exercise increase ApN blood concentration. Some forms of ApN can reach the brain parenchyma through the cerebrospinal fluid. In the brain , the increase in ApN exerts powerful antidepressant and anxiolytic effects , in particular by fighting against neuroinflammation.
