  In the American continent , larval forms ( caterpillars) of the Lonomia genus can cause systemic reactions in human beings. In this Paper , we report the third case of Lonomia envenoming recorded in French Guiana in 25 years , and the first in which specific antivenom was administered. Severe<symptom> symptoms<symptom> of the envenoming were observed in our patient including pain; coagulopathy and systemic hemorrhage<symptom>. They are caused by skin contact with caterpillars. Recovery , however , was quite satisfactory thanks to the international cooperation of the health authorities in both France and Brazil.
