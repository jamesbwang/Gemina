  Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement ( TMVR) is currently under clinical investigation as a viable treatment option for mitral regurgitation ( MR). Therefore , it is important to outline the key functional requirements of a TMVR prosthesis in order to provide an overall approach to assessing mitral valve replacement devices utilizing a combination of in vitro and preclinical methods. This article provides a review of the mitral valve disease as well as general considerations and guidance for developing a TMVR device based on International Industry Standards. Specific details pertaining to the mitral valve apparatus , morphology of mitral valve disease , assessment of specific patient population as well as hazard analysis to evaluate and develop a TMVR device to treat a specific patient population have been included. The details contained within this report are not all inclusive or explicate for every technology being developed but rather thought of as a general guide on how a TMVR technology could be developed in alignment with International Industry Standards. Key learnings from the Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement ( TAVR) experience has also been considered and taken into account when outlining this general guidance for TMVR. Key learning points from the TAVR development experience included the following: quantification of acceptable levels of paravalvular leak , valve migration potential using various anchoring methods and overall implant frame failure modes when treating the native aortic valve. It should be noted that TAVR is over a decade further along in development and clinical experience compared to TMVR. These key learnings from the early experience with TAVR should be considered with all transcatheter development projects.
