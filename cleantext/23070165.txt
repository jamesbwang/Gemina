  Linezolid is considered as a last-resort antimicrobial agent , the resistance of which is of great concern. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms and transferability of linezolid resistance and molecular epidemiology of linezolid-resistant enterococcal isolates in Wenzhou , China. A collection of 1623 enterococcal strains , including 789 Enterococcus<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> and 834 Enterococcus<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> , were isolated from our hospital during 2011-2016. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and clinical data analysis were performed. Molecular mechanisms of linezolid resistance , including the existence of resistance genes cfr and optrA , as well as the mutations in 23S rRNA and ribosomal proteins L3 , L4 , and L22 , were investigated by PCR and sequencing. Conjugation experiments were conducted , and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed by PFGE and MLST. In our study , 31 ( 3.93 %) E.<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> and 2 ( 0.24 %) E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> exhibited resistance to linezolid. Risk factors correlated with linezolid-resistant enterococcal infections included gastrointestinal surgery hospitalization , urogenital disorders , tumor , diabetes , and polymicrobial infections. Among these isolates , 6 ( 18.18 %) harbored cfr , 9 ( 27.27 %) harbored optrA , and 18 ( 54.55 %) co-harbored cfr and optrA. However , mutational mechanisms were not found in this study. Conjugation experiments demonstrated the transferability of cfr and optrA between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The clone of these isolates was diverse and scattered. It is noteworthy that cfr and optrA were the main mechanisms of linezolid resistance in this study , posing a potential risk of spread of linezolid resistance. Strikingly , it reported firstly that the two transferable resistance genes cfr and optrA coexisted in the same E.<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> isolates.
