  Tightly coordinated grip force adaptations in response to changing load forces have been reported as continuous , stable , and proportional to the load force changes. Considering the existence of inherent sensorimotor feedback delays , current accounts of grip force-load force coupling invoke explicit predictive mechanisms in the form of internal models for feedforward control to account for anticipatory grip force modulations. However , recent findings suggest that the stability and regularity of grip force-load force coupling is less persistent than previously thought. Thus , the objective of the current study was to comprehensively quantify the time-varying characteristics of grip force-load force coupling. Investigations into the coupling 's dynamics during continuous 30 s bouts of load force oscillation revealed intermittent phases of coordination , as well as phases that varied in stability , rather than a persistent and continuously stable pattern of coordination. These findings have important implications for accounts of grip force-load force coupling and of anticipation in motor control , more broadly.
