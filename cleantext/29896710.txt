  Chemical or environmental aggression often leads to oxidative stress and antioxidant responses in organisms in which are involved several components and enzymes. Catalase , glutathione-S-transferase , total glutathione and lipid peroxidation are key elements to understand the oxidative status of an organism and have been measured using spectrophotometric methods adapted to 96-well microtiter plates. In this work we describe the methodologies for analyses in pools of 96 h zebrafish ( Danio<pathogen> rerio<pathogen> embryos.
