  Ultraporous acetabular components were developed to improve osseointegration and fit for increased longevity and better outcomes after total hip arthroplasty. There is a paucity of literature detailing this acetabular component 's clinical performance , with even less detailing those with screw fixation. We identify 5 patients at our institution who underwent revision total hip arthroplasty for early aseptic acetabular cup loosening of an ultraporous acetabular component known as the Tritanium primary cup with secondary screw fixation. They all presented with groin and hip<symptom> pain<symptom> after index surgery and underwent follow-up radiographic examination consistent with component loosening requiring revision surgery. This case series reports on the risk of early acetabular cup loosening and its associated clinical presentation , workup , and surgical management in patients with the Tritanium primary cup augmented with screws.
