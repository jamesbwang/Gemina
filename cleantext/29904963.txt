  The clinical course and optimal treatment strategy for asymptomatic extracranial carotid artery aneurysms<disease> ( ECAAs) are unknown. We report our single-center experience with conservative management of patients with an asymptomatic ECAA. A search in our hospital records from 1998 to 2013 revealed 20 patients ( mean age 52 ( SD 12.5) years) with 23 ECAAs , defined as a 150 % or more fusiform dilation or any saccular dilatation compared with the healthy internal carotid artery. None of the aneurysms<disease> were treated and we had no pre-defined follow-up schedule for these patients. The primary study end-point was the yearly rate for ipsilateral ischemic stroke. Secondary end-points were ipsilateral transient ischemic attack , any stroke-related death , other symptoms related to the aneurysm<disease> or growth defined as any diameter increase. The ECAA was either fusiform ( n = 6; mean diameter 10.2 mm) or saccular ( n = 17; mean diameter 10.9 mm). Eleven ( 55 %) patients with 13 ECAAs received antithrombotic medication. During follow-up ( median 46.5 ( range 1-121) months) , one patient died due to ipsilateral stroke and the ipsilateral cerebral stroke rate was 1.1 per 100 patient-years ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.01-6.3). Three patients had ECAA growth , two of whom were asymptomatic and one was the patient who suffered a stroke. In this retrospective case series of patients with an asymptomatic ECAA , the risk of cerebral infarction is small but not negligible. Conservative management seems justified , in particular in patients without growth. Large prospective registry data are necessary to assess follow-up imaging strategies and the role of antiplatelet therapy.
