  Evidence supports olanzapine for prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting ( CINV) for highly emetogenic chemotherapy; however , most studies focus on solid malignancies and single-day regimens. A randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial was conducted to compare the addition of olanzapine to triplet therapy ( fosaprepitant , ondansetron , dexamethasone ( FOND-O)) versus triplet therapy alone ( FOND) in preventing CINV in hematology patients receiving single-day and multiple-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT) regimens ( NCT02635984). The primary objective of this study was to compare complete response ( CR; no emesis and minimal nausea<symptom> , < 25 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale) during the overall assessment period ( chemotherapy days plus 5days after). Secondary objectives were the number of emesis , number of rescue medications , percent achieving minimal nausea<symptom> , and percent achieving complete protection ( CP; no emesis , rescue antiemetic , or significant nausea<symptom> , all of which are reported as acute ( chemotherapy days) , delayed ( 5days after chemotherapy) , and overall phases. Olanzapine 10 mg or matching placebo were given on each chemotherapy day and 3 days after. Adults with hematologic malignancy receiving HCT regimens of melphalan , BEAM ( carmustine , etoposide , cytarabine , melphalan) , busulfan ( Bu)/ cyclophosphamide ( Cy) , Bu/fludarabine ( Flu) , Bu/melphalan , FluCy , FluCy-total body irradiation ( TBI) , etoposide-TBI , and ICE ( ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide) or 7 +3 chemotherapy regimens were included. An estimated 98 patients were required using alpha = .05 and 80 % power. No significant differences existed in baseline characteristics between FOND-O ( n = 51) and FOND ( n = 50) arms. Mean duration of olanzapine was 7.7 days ( range , 4 to 11). Discontinuation for possible adverse events occurred in 3 placebo and 0 olanzapine patients. CR was significantly higher for FOND-O in overall ( 55 % versus 26 % , P = .003) and delayed ( 60.8 % versus 30 % , P = .001) but not acute ( P = .13) phases. Significantly more patients receiving FOND-O achieved no more than minimal nausea<symptom> in overall ( P = .001) and delayed phases ( P = .0002) , as well as fewer overall mean emesis counts ( P = .005). CP rates were not different in any assessment phase ( P â‰¥ .05 each). Within the HCT subgroup ( n = 64) , the CR , CP , and no significant nausea<symptom> rates were significantly better for FONDO-O in overall and delayed phases ( all P < .05). Analysis within the HCT subgroup revealed significant improvement in outcomes in delayed and overall phases with FOND-O in the autologous but not allogeneic cohort. Addition of olanzapine to an NK-1-based triplet antiemetic regimen significantly improved clinically relevant outcomes in the HCT population.
