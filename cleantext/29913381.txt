  Anhedonia , the reduced capacity to experience pleasure , has long been regarded as a cardinal symptom in depression<symptom> and schizophrenia. Recent evidence highlights that anhedonia is not a single construct but consists of an anticipatory component and a consummatory component , which is captured by the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale ( TEPS). The current event-related potential study examined the electrophysiological underpinnings of anticipatory and consummatory aspects of anhedonia as assessed by the TEPS in a non-clinical sample. EEG was recorded during both anticipatory and consummatory phases of incentive processing in an anticipatory-anhedonia ( ANT) group , a consummatory-anhedonia ( CON) group , and a control ( CNT) group selected from a large sample based on their TEPS scores. The ANT relative to the CON group exhibited a reduced cue-P3 during the anticipatory phase , a less positive feedback-related negativity ( FRN) and a blunted feedback P3 ( fb-P3) during the consummatory phase. Moreover , correlation results revealed a dissociation between anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia , which occurred in an unexpected way such that higher levels of anticipatory anhedonia were associated with reduced fb-P3 amplitudes whereas higher levels of consummatory anhedonia with enhanced cue-P3 and FRN amplitudes. The sample size for each group was relatively small. Anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia as measured by the TEPS might be driven by abnormal motivational salience , which was represented by the cue-P3 during the anticipatory phase and the FRN and fb-P3 during the consummatory phase of incentive processing.
