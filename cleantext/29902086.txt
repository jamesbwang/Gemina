  Bleomycin sclerotherapy has been shown to be a viable treatment for lymphatic malformations. However , its use for these lesions<symptom> confined to the orbit is becoming increasingly documented in the literature. In this study , we summarize the clinical manifestations and outcomes observed following percutaneous bleomycin sclerotherapy for orbital lymphatic malformation. A 5-year retrospective chart review of patients with clinical , radiographic , and/or biopsy-confirmed diagnoses of orbital lymphatic malformation that received bleomycin sclerotherapy was conducted at the Emory Hospital and Clinics. Data examined included patient demographics , patient history and symptoms , clinical findings , radiographic findings , route of bleomycin delivery , and outcome. Of the 10 patients who met inclusion criteria , the median age of treatment was 7 years. The most common presenting symptoms included vision change<symptom> and proptosis. Nine of 10 patients demonstrated macrocysts ( > 1 cm) on imaging. Seven of 10 patients had histories of prior interventions including resections , cyst<symptom> drainage , and debulking. Because 2 of these 10 patients were lost to follow-up , 8 patients remained for post-procedural evaluation. Four of these eight showed improvement of visual acuity after post-bleomycin sclerotherapy. In seven of eight patients , extraocular motility either improved or remained stable. Pretreatment and posttreatment exophthalmometer measurements obtained in four patients revealed an average improvement in proptosis of 65 % from their average pretreatment measurements. Our findings suggest that percutaneous bleomycin sclerotherapy is a viable option for treatment of orbital lymphatic malformations , with potentially greater benefit to those with macrocystic features.
