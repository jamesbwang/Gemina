  Evidence has confirmed that placental/fetal hypoxia plays a key role in both endothelial cell dysfunction and PE pathogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether maternal/placental hypoxia-inducible factor1-α ( HIF1-α) C1772T ( rs11549465) and/or G1790A ( rs11549467) polymorphisms and HIF1-α mRNA expression are associated with PE development. The blood samples of 203 PE and 202 control women and the placenta of 86 PE and 84 control women were collected after delivery. The HIF1-α polymorphisms were genotyped using PCR- RFLP method. The mRNA expression levels were measured by Quantitative Real- Time PCR. The present study found no association between maternal HIF1-α rs11549465 and rs11549467 and placental rs11549467 polymorphisms and PE. However , the placental rs11549465 polymorphism was associated with PE in the dominant model. The CT/GG combined genotypes and TG haplotype of placental rs11549465 and rs11549467 polymorphisms were associated with higher risk of PE. The HIF1-α mRNA expression was 3-fold higher in the PE women. The rs11549465 TT genotype was associated with higher HIF1-α mRNA expression in PE women and in total population and rs11549467 GA genotype was associated with higher mRNA expression in total population. The relative mRNA expression of HIF1-α gene was higher in presence of CC/GA , TT/GG and TT/GA combined genotypes. This study found an association between placental but not maternal HIF1-α rs11549465 polymorphism and PE in the dominant model. The HIF1-α mRNA expression was higher in the placenta of PE women and was associated with rs11549465 and rs11549467 polymorphisms.
