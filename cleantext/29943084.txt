  Glutamate dehydrogenase ( GDH) catalyzes the reversible deamination of L-glutamate to Î±-ketoglutarate and ammonia<pathogen> In mammals , GDH contributes to important processes such as amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism , energy production , ammonia<pathogen> management , neurotransmitter recycling and insulin secretion. In humans , two isoforms of GDH are found , namely hGDH1 and hGDH2 , with the former being ubiquitously expressed and the latter found mainly in brain , testis and kidney. These two iso-enzymes display highly divergent allosteric properties , especially concerning their basal activity , ADP activation and GTP inhibition. On the other hand , both enzymes are thought to predominantly localize in the mitochondrial matrix , even though alternative localizations have been proposed. To further study the subcellular localization of the two human iso-enzymes , we created HEK293 cell lines stably over-expressing hGDH1 and hGDH2. In these cell lines , immunofluorescence and enzymatic analyses verified the overexpression of both hGDH1 and hGDH2 iso-enzymes , whereas subcellular fractionation followed by immunoblotting showed their predominantly mitochondrial localization. Given that previous studies have only indirectly compared the subcellular localization of the two iso-enzymes , we co-expressed them tagged with different fluorescent dyes ( green and red fluorescent protein for hGDH1 and hGDH2 , respectively) and found them to co-localize. Despite the wealth of information related to the functional properties of hGDH1 and hGDH2 and the availability of the hGDH1 structure , there is still an ongoing debate concerning their metabolic role and their involvement in disease processes. Data on the localization of hGDHs , as the ones presented here , could contribute to better understanding of the function of these important human enzymes.
