  The titanium butterfly implant seems to be a powerful technique to repair nasal valve insufficiency. However , the effect of these implants on nasal patency and quality of life has been controversial due to a lack of evidence. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the objective and subjective effect of the titanium butterfly implant on nasal patency and corresponding quality of life. Nasal patency and quality of life of 32 patients undergoing a titanium butterfly implant were evaluated by measuring peak nasal inspiratory flow ( PNIF) and completing three validated questionnaires: the NOSE , SNOT-22 and GBI , before surgery , six weeks and six months after surgery. The mean PNIF increased significant after 6 weeks , as well as after 6 months. Both the NOSE and SNOT-22 questionnaire scores showed a significant decrease at both post-operative measurements. The GBI indicated a significant increase at 6 weeks and 6 months. There were no significant differences between both of the post-operative measurements. This is the first study indicating that the titanium butterfly implant provides a significant and clinically relevant increase in nasal patency and corresponding quality of life in patients with nasal valve insufficiency.
