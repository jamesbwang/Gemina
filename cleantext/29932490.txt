  β-Aminoalkylboronic acids are bioisosteres of the pharmaceutically important class of β-amino acids but few stereoselective methods exist for their preparation. The 1,2-addition of lithiated 1,1-diborylalkanes onto chiral N-tert-butanesulfinyl aldimines produces β-sulfinimido gem-bis ( boronates) in good to excellent yields with high diastereoselectivity. The optimized conditions involve the use of rubidium fluoride and water , and are compatible with functionalized alkyl , aryl , alkenyl , and alkynyl substituents. Under these conditions , the geminal quaternary alkyl bis ( pinacolatoboryl) intermediates undergo a highly diastereoselective monoprotodeboronation to afford a wide range of syn-α , β-disubstituted β-aminoalkylboronates. This novel application of protodeboronation chemistry was shown to result from a kinetically controlled , diastereotopic-group-selective B-C bond protolysis dictated by the configuration of the adjacent stereogenic C-N center. Facile acidic cleavage of the sulfinimide auxiliary produces the free aminoboronates with high enantiomeric purity.
