  The aim of surgical management of benign facial skin lumps is to remove the lesion<symptom> in its entirety , with minimal damage to adjacent tissue structures , while maintaining facial aesthetics. A method to achieve these goals is to remove peri-oral lesions<symptom> in the labial and buccal zones via an intra-oral approach. We report an extended cases series of facial skin lumps that were excised using an intra-oral approach. A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients who underwent excisions of benign cutaneous lesions<symptom> on the face via an intra-oral approach. Patient demographics , indication for surgery and complications were noted. Forty-seven lesions<symptom> were excised over a 15-year period. Indications for surgery included benign lesion<symptom> with minimal skin involvement , risks of keloid/scar hypertrophy and cosmetic factors. Lesions<symptom> were predominantly epidermoid cysts<symptom> and lipomas. Mean follow-up was 2.9 years with a 6.4 % recurrence rate and 2.1 % rate of haematoma and transient<symptom> facial<symptom> nerve<symptom> weakness<symptom>. There are established techniques to remove facial skin lumps. We believe that in selected cases , an intra-oral approach to such lesions<symptom> , particularly in cases with high risk of scar pathology or where there is strong patient preference , may be an important tool in the oral and maxillofacial surgeon 's armamentarium.
