  Black populations from sub-Saharan Africa have a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease , which places significant strain on public health systems. Aortic stiffness is a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular disease development. We reported earlier that excessive alcohol use predicts aortic stiffness. However , we require a better understanding of other biomarkers involved in stiffness development , beyond alcohol use. Therefore , we determined which biomarkers ( metabolic , inflammatory , endothelial activation and oxidative stress) relate to aortic stiffness in young and older black South Africans , self-reporting no alcohol-use. We included cross-sectional data from young ( aged 24.7 ± 3.24 years) black adults participating in the African Prospective study on the Early Detection and Identification of Cardiovascular Disease and Hypertension ( African-PREDICT) study ( N = 216) , and five-year follow-up data from older ( aged 61.6 ± 9.77 years) black adults ( N = 322) participating in the South African leg of the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology study , conducted in the North West Province ( PURE-SA-NWP). We excluded all participants self-reporting alcohol use. We determined biomarkers from blood samples , and measured carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ( PWV). Of all biomarkers investigated in multivariable-adjusted regression analyses , only plasma glucose ( R Dysglycaemia independently predicted aortic stiffness after five years in older black adults. Life-course management of body<symptom> weight and sugar intake are important in preventing early vascular ageing and subsequent cardiovascular disease development in Africa.
