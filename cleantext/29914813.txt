  Aneurysms<disease> of the inferior vena cava ( IVC) are uncommon. Symptomatic patients usually present with thrombosis and venous obstruction. Classification is based on location and the presence or absence of congenital IVC interruption. Treatment options include observation , open surgical resection , and endovascular modalities , of which coil embolization and stent graft placement have previously been described. We report the case of a patient with a 5.0-cm infrarenal IVC aneurysm<disease> and associated congenital stenosis who successfully underwent balloon angioplasty. Whereas management should be determined on an individual basis , balloon angioplasty is a plausible treatment for IVC aneurysms<disease> in the setting of congenital stenosis.
