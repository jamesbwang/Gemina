  ( 1) Background: Thiamine is an important cofactor for multiple metabolic processes. Its role in cancer has been debated for years. Our aim is to determine if thiamine can convert the cellular metabolic state of breast cancer cells from anaerobic to aerobic , thus reducing their growth. ( 2) Methods: Breast cancer ( MCF7) and non-tumorigenic ( MCF10A) cell lines were treated with various doses of thiamine and assessed for changes in cell growth. The mechanism of this relationship was identified through the measurement of enzymatic activity and metabolic changes. ( 3) Results: A high dose of thiamine reduced cell proliferation in MCF7 ( 63 % decrease ,
