  To investigate the effect of altering occlusal vertical dimension ( OVD) in patients with severe attrition on corticomotor control of the masseter muscles as assessed by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation ( nTMS). Seven patients ( 58.6 Â± 8.4 years) with decreased OVD due to severe attrition were given mandibular occlusal splints to alter the OVD with the instruction to wear during the whole awake time for a period of four weeks. Motor-evoked potentials ( MEPs) and the motor cortex maps of the masseter muscles and first dorsal interosseous ( FDI) muscles as control were recorded by nTMS at baseline and at least 4 weeks after the alteration of OVD. The stimulus-response curves of MEPs were analysed with two-way repeated-measures ANOVA , and the numerical rating scale scores , motor thresholds , onset latencies , motor cortex maps and centre of gravity ( COG) were analysed with paired t tests. There was a significant increase in the amplitude of the masseter muscle MEPs ( P = 0.036) , but no change in the motor cortex map areas ( P = 0.111) four weeks after the alteration of OVD. Furthermore , there was no significant difference in either the amplitude of the FDI muscle MEPs ( P = 0.466) or the motor cortex map areas ( P = 0.230) before and after OVD alteration. The results suggest that alteration of OVD in patients with severe attrition was associated with signs of neuroplastic changes in the corticomotor control of the masseter muscles. The results of the study may add to our understanding of the putative mechanisms related to cortical changes in response to OVD alterations.
