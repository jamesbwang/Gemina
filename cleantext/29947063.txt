  Polymerization-induced self-assembly ( PISA) and in situ crosslinking of the formed nanoparticles are successfully realized by activators regenerated by electron-transfer atom transfer radical polymerization ( ARGET ATRP) of glycidyl methacrylate ( GMA) or a mixture of GMA/benzyl methacrylate ( BnMA) monomers in ethanol. Poly ( oligo ( ethylene oxide) methyl ether methacrylate) was employed as macroinitiator/stabilizer , and a cupric bromide/tris ( pyridin-2-ylmethyl) amine complex as catalyst. Tin ( 2-ethylhexanoate) was used as reducing agent for ARGET ATRP , and simultaneously acted as a catalyst for ring-opening polymerization of oxirane ring in GMA. The kinetics shows that the double bond in GMA was completely polymerized in 4.0 h , while only a 33 % conversion of oxirane ring in GMA was reached at 117.0 h. Such a large difference would guarantee a smooth PISA and a subsequent in situ crosslinking of formed nanoparticles. The transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering show spherical nanoparticles formed. With a feed molar ratio ( BnMA)
