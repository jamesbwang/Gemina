  The objectives of this study were to formulate microcrystals of entecavir-3-palmiate ( EV-P) , a palmitic acid ester of entecavir ( EV) , and evaluate the influence of particle size on its pharmacokinetic behavior following subcutaneous ( SC) injection. Systemic toxicity and local tolerability of the hepatitis<disease> B<disease> anti-viral suspension were further evaluated in normal rats. EV-P microcrystals possessing median diameters of 2.1 , 6.3 , and 12.7 µm were fabricated using anti-solvent crystallization technique with polysorbate 20 and polyethylene glycol 4000 as steric stabilizer. Dissolution rate of EV-P microcrystals was controlled by adjusting the particle size , under sink condition. Pharmacokinetic profiles of 2.1 µm-sized and 6.3 µm-sized EV-P microcrystals were quite comparable ( 1.44 mg/kg as EV) , over 46 days in rats. The absorption rate and extent of EV after SC injection of 12.7 µm-sized microcrystals were significantly retarded , due to its slower dissolution rate in aqueous media. No single-dose systemic toxicity was observed after SC injection of high dose of EV-P microcrystal suspension ( 30-300 mg/kg as EV). The microcrystals were tolerable in the injected site , showing mild inflammatory responses at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Therefore , the novel microcrystal system with median particle size of below 6.3 µm is expected to be a unique long-acting system of the anti-viral agent , improving patient 's compliance with
