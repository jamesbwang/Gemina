  Successful identification of skeletonized remains often relies upon DNA analyses , frequently focusing on the mid-diaphysis of weight-bearing long bones. This study explored intra-bone DNA variability using bovine and porcine femora , along with calcanei and tali. DNA from fresh and short-term environmentally exposed bone was extracted utilizing demineralization and standard lysis buffer protocols , and DNA quantity and quality were measured. Overall , femoral epiphyses , metaphyses , and the tarsals had more nuclear and mitochondrial DNA than did the femoral diaphyses. DNA loss was much more rapid in buried bones than in surface exposed bones , while DNA quality differed based on environment , but not bone region/element. The demineralization protocol generated more DNA in some bone regions , while the standard lysis was more effective in others , and neither significantly affected DNA quality. Taken together , these findings reinforce the importance of considering inter- and intra-bone heterogeneity when sampling skeletal material for forensic DNA-based identifications.
