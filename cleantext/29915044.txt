  Cells respond to iron deficiency by activating iron-regulatory proteins to increase cellular iron uptake and availability. However , it is not clear how cells adapt to conditions when cellular iron uptake does not fully match iron demand. Here , we show that the mRNA-binding protein tristetraprolin ( TTP) is induced by iron deficiency and degrades mRNAs of mitochondrial Fe/S-cluster-containing proteins , specifically
