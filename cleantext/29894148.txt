  Conjugated polymers with a helical structure have been in rapid development in recent years because of their potential applications in chemical and biological sensors. We demonstrate the fabrication and characterization of helical nanofibrils of block copolymer poly ( 4-iso-cyano-benzoic acid 5- ( 2-dimethylamino-ethoxy) -2-nitro-benzylester)- b-poly ( 3-hexylthiophene) ( PPI (- DMAENBA)- b-P3HT) via a transfer-etching method. The density and lateral length of nanofibrils can be facilely controlled by regulating the process conditions , which , in turn , directly determine the electronic property. Organic field effect transistors based on helical nanofibrils were successfully fabricated with the highest mobility of 9.1 Ã— 10
