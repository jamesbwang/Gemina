  The first comprehensive and systematic theoretical exploration of the bonding nature and energetics of the interactions between Ag ( I) cation and a wide set of Ï€-ligands was accomplished. This set ranges from simple ethylene and aromatic benzene to planar and curved polyaromatic molecules and to closed-cage C
