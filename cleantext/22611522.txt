  Obesity has become a severe worldwide problem. Compared to healthy-weight individuals , obese individuals seem to show an increased sensitivity to tempting food. In the present study , we test the pre-exposure effect , which implies that consumption of tempting food is decreased after exposure to tempting food cues in a context of a task that discourages food consumption. Healthy-weight and obese-weight participants were recruited via social media and university channels. Participants took part in a scrabble task with either candy letters or foam letters and subsequently engaged in a taste test. Results showed that in healthy-weight participants , consumption was reduced after solving the scrabble task with candy letters in comparison to foam letters. In obese-weight participants , consumption was reduced in the condition using foam letters ( in comparison with healthy-weight participants). The pre-exposure effect was replicated in healthy-weight participants , but could not be observed in participants with obesity , since consumption was reduced in general in this group. Our results suggest that more work should be done to understand how food nudges work in the context of obesity.
