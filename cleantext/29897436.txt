  Schools are crucial settings for young people 's development. Rare studies have examined the impact of perceived school-climate and academic well-being on young people 's self-rated health in joint analyses. This study focuses on the role of perceived school-climate and academic well-being for young people 's self-rated health and examines whether school climate is mediated by indicators of academic well-being. Data were obtained from the German National Educational Panel Study , including seventh grade students ( n = 6838) aged 11-12 , nested in 710 classes within 277 schools. Indicators of school climate ( teacher control , demands , autonomy , interaction , goal setting and orientation , teaching quality) and academic well-being ( satisfaction with school , helplessness in major school subjects) were reported from students. Multilevel modelling was used to analyze the relative importance of perceived school-climate and academic well-being on school-aged children 's self-rated health. Results showed that academic well-being is strongly related to self-rated health. The better students perceive their academic well-being , the lower the likelihood of poor self-rated health. In contrast , indicators of perceived school climate are only indirectly related to self-rated health , mediated by academic well-being or are not at all associated with self-rated health. This study suggests that school climate is important for academic well-being but not as important for students ' self-rated health as academic well-being. Health promotion initiatives in schools have to ensure that school climate serves to enhance students ' academic well-being to avoid health problems in the long-run.
