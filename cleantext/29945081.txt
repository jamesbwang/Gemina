  Ten infrequently monitored antibiotics in biosolids were examined in archived American sewage sludges ( n = 79) collected as part of the 2006/2007 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA) Targeted National Sewage Sludge Survey. This study inspected the occurrence of amoxicillin , ampicillin , erythromycin , furazolidone ( proxy metabolite: 3- ( 2-nitrobenzylidenamino) -2-oxazolidinone ( NP-AOZ)) , nalidixic acid , oxolinic acid , oxytetracycline , spiramycin , sulfadimidine , and sulfadimethoxine in sewage sludges after nearly a decade in frozen storage. Six antibiotics were detected at the following average concentrations ( ng/g dry weight): amoxicillin ( 1.0) , nalidixic acid ( 19.1) , oxolinic acid ( 2.7) , erythromycin ( 0.6) , oxytetracycline ( 4.5) , and ampicillin ( 14.8). The remaining four were not detected in any samples ( < method detection limit , ng/g dry weight): sulfadimethoxine ( < 0.5) , sulfadimidine ( < 1.0) , spiramycin ( < 2.0) , and NP-AOZ ( < 20.0). This study provides the first data on spiramycin , NP-AOZ , and nalidixic acid in U.S. sewage sludges. This study also provides new data on the losses of 5 antibiotics during long term frozen storage ( -20 Â°C) in comparison to the 2006/2007 U.S. EPA Targeted National Sewage Sludge Survey.
