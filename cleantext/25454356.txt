  Individual differences in empathy can have positive and negative psychological outcomes. Yet , individual differences in the processing and regulation of empathy-induced emotion have not been fully explored within this dynamic. This study was designed to explore whether individual differences in emotion regulation strategies moderated the effects of empathy on common forms of affective distress. Eight hundred and forty four participants completed survey measures of trait empathy , emotion regulation strategies , and symptoms of depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , and stress. Affective empathy typically predicted greater affective distress , but the effects on depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> were offset when people were effective at reappraising their emotions. Cognitive empathy predicted lower distress on average , but this beneficial effect on anxiety<symptom> and stress was absent in those who typically suppressed their emotions. Finally , suppression unexpectedly reduced the depression<symptom> and stress reported for people high in affective empathy. Individual differences in emotion regulation are an important moderator between empathy and psychological health , and thus a useful target for intervention.
