  The current study was aimed to prepare antimicrobial agents for food preservation from crude cheese whey. Crude cheese whey was digested with porcine pepsin , calf and fungal rennets at various pHs. The digests were assessed for antibacterial activities against Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> The calf rennet digest at pH 3.0 showed the highest antibacterial activity. Three antibacterial peptides against B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> lactoferrin f ( 20-30) , and ß-lactoglobulin f ( 14-22) and f ( 92-103) were identified in the calf rennet digest. Only lactoferrin f ( 20-30) also exerted bactericidal activity against E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that the three peptides were generated by the porcine pepsin at pH 2.5 , whereas the calf rennet generated them at a wider pH ( pH 2.5-3.5). Fungal rennet generated only ß-lactoglobulin f ( 14-22) at pH 3.5. The pepsin and calf rennet digests at pH 2.5 and 3.0 , respectively , reduced the E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> populations by approximately 2 log at 6000 μg mL The calf rennet and porcine pepsin digests of cheese whey at specific acidic pH , which can be prepared from food-grade materials , have potential for natural food preservative due to the presence of the three antibacterial peptides.
