  Tumor detection and visualization plays a key role in the clinical workflow of a patient with suspected cancer , both in the diagnosis and treatment. Several optical imaging techniques have been evaluated for guidance during oncological interventions. Optical coherence tomography ( OCT) is a technique which has been widely evaluated during the past decades. This review aims to determine the clinical usefulness of OCT during cancer interventions focussing on qualitative features , quantitative features and the diagnostic value of OCT.. A systematic literature search was performed for articles published before May 2018 using OCT in the field of surgical oncology. Based on these articles , an overview of the clinical usefulness of OCT was provided per tumor type. A total of 785 articles were revealed by our search , of which a total of 136 original articles were available for analysis , which formed the basis of this review. OCT is currently utilised for both preoperative diagnosis and intraoperative detection of skin , oral , lung , breast , hepatobiliary , gastrointestinal , urological , and gynaecological malignancies. It showed promising results in tumor detection on a microscopic level , especially using higher resolution imaging techniques , such as high-definition OCT and full-field OCT.. In the near future , OCT could be used as an additional tool during bronchoscopic or endoscopic interventions and could also be implemented in margin assessment during ( laparoscopic) cancer surgery if a laparoscopic or handheld OCT device will be further developed to make routine clinical use possible.
