  Calprotectin ( CP , S100A8/S100A9 oligomer , MRP-8/ MRP-14 oligomer) is a host-defense protein that sequesters nutrient transition metals from microbes. Each S100A8/S100A9 heterodimer contains four EF-hand domains and two transition-metal-binding sites. We investigate the effect of Ca ( II) ions on the structure and Ni ( II)- binding properties of human CP. By employing energy dispersive X-ray ( EDX) spectroscopy , we evaluate the metal content of Ni ( II)- bound CP-Ser ( oligomer of S100A8 ( C42S) and S100A9 ( C3S)) crystals obtained in the absence and presence of Ca ( II). We present a 2.1 Ã… resolution crystal structure of Ni ( II)- bound CP-Ser and compare this structure to a reported Ni ( II)- and Ca ( II)- bound CP-Ser structure ( Nakashige , T. G. , et al. ( 2017) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 139 , 8828-8836). This analysis reveals conformational changes associated with coordination of Ca ( II) to the EF-hands of S100A9 and that Ca ( II) binding affects the coordination number and geometry of the Ni ( II) ion bound to the His
