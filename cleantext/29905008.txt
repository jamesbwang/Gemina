  Tissue engineering , as a novel transplantation therapy , aims to create biomaterial scaffolds resembling the extracellular matrix in order to regenerate the damaged tissues. Adding bioactive factors to the scaffold would improve cell-tissue interactions. In this study , the effect of chitosan poly vinyl alcohol nanofibers containing carbon nanotube scaffold with or without active bioglass ( BG
