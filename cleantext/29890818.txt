  The hearing-aid transducer is ubiquitous in the hearing-aid industry. For example , the balanced armature receiver ( BAR) , first invented by A.G. Bell , has been used in all telephone earphones because it has the highest output and best frequency response. Nevertheless , previous electro-mechanical studies on these miniature speakers are quite primitive , given the price of the transducers. Thus , more detailed analysis is critically important for the field of hearing science. This review study was motivated by Hunt 's parameter calibration ( 1954) , a widely used commercial hearing-aid receiver ( ED series , manufactured by Knowles Electronics , Inc.). In the body of the study , the transfer function of the BAR system ( i.e. , pressure over voltage) was calculated from Hunt 's parameters , solely from the electrical terminals of the device. The computed transfer function was then further investigated by comparing to the pole-zero fitting method using the methods of Gustavsen and Semlyen ( 1999) and Prony ( 1975). Based on our short experiment , the better fitting result was achieved with Gustavsen and Semlyen 's method. By decomposing results of the transfer function fitting into all-pass and minimum-phase parts , the system was confirmed as a delay system. We conclude that the BAR system is linear , time-invariant , stable , and causal while providing an evidencebased understanding of the hearing-aid receiver system.
