  Exosomes shed by tumor cells have been recognized as promising biomarkers for cancer diagnostics due to their unique composition and functions. Quantification of low concentrations of specific exosomes present in very small volumes of clinical samples may be used for noninvasive cancer diagnosis and prognosis. We developed an immunosorbent assay for digital qualification of target exosomes using droplet microfluidics. The exosomes were immobilized on magnetic microbeads through sandwich ELISA complexes tagged with an enzymatic reporter that produces a fluorescent signal. The constructed beads were further isolated and encapsulated into a sufficient number of droplets to ensure only a single bead was encapsulated in a droplet. Our droplet-based single-exosome-counting enzyme-linked immunoassay ( droplet digital ExoELISA) approach enables absolute counting of cancer-specific exosomes to achieve unprecedented accuracy. We were able to achieve a limit of detection ( LOD) down to 10 enzyme-labeled exosome complexes per microliter ( âˆ¼ 10
