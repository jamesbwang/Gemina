  Organic photovoltaics ( OPV) have the advantage of possible fabrication by energy-efficient and cost-effective deposition methods , such as solution processing. Solvent additives can provide fine control of the active layer morphology of OPVs by influencing film formation during solution processing. As such , solvent additives form a versatile method of experimental control for improving organic solar cell device performance. This review provides a brief history of solution-processed bulk heterojunction OPVs and the advent of solvent additives , putting them into context with other methods available for morphology control. It presents the current understanding of how solvent additives impact various mechanisms of phase separation , enabled by recent advances in in situ morphology characterization. Indeed , understanding solvent additives ' effects on film formation has allowed them to be applied and combined effectively and synergistically to boost OPV performance. Their success as a morphology control strategy has also prompted the use of solvent additives in related organic semiconductor technologies. Finally , the role of solvent additives in the development of next-generation OPV active layers is discussed. Despite concerns over their environmental toxicity and role in device instability , solvent additives remain relevant morphological directing agents as research interests evolve toward nonfullerene acceptors , ternary blends , and environmentally sustainable solvents.
