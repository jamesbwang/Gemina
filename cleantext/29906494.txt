  Inflammation<symptom> is considered to be the common pathophysiological basis for a series of diseases. Documented data showed the anti-inflammatory effects of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge ( Danshen) , a traditional herb. The pharmacological activities of dihydronortanshinone ( DNT) , a tanshinone isolated from Danshen , remain unknown. In this study , the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of DNT were investigated with a lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced RAW264 .7 macrophage model. DNT significantly suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory mediators such as nitrite oxide ( NO) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α ( TNF-α) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6) , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS). LPS-induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS) generation was inhibited by DNT , rotenone ( Rot) , thenoyltrifluoroacetone ( TTFA) , and antimycin A ( AA). Furthermore , DNT inhibited LPS-induced NF-κBp65 phosphorylation , nuclear translocation , as well as JNK1/2 and p38MAPK phosphorylation. In addition , DNT interrupted Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4) dimerization and molecular docking results suggested that it was buried in the pocket of TLR4-MD2 complex. In conclusion , DNT inhibited LPS-induced inflammation<symptom> mainly through NF-κB , mitochondrial ROS , and MAPK pathways possibly mediated by interfering LPS-TLR4-MD2 complex.
