  Cholestasis represents a major subtype of drug-induced liver injury and novel preclinical models for its prediction are needed. Here we used primary human hepatocytes ( PHH) from different donors in 2D-sandwich ( 2D-sw) and/or 3D-spheroid cultures to study inter-individual differences in the response towards cholestatic hepatotoxins after short-term ( 48-72 hours) and long-term repeated exposures ( 14 days). The cholestatic liabilities of drugs were determined by comparing cell viability upon exposure to the highest non-cytotoxic drug concentration in the presence and absence of a non-cytotoxic concentrated bile acid mixture. In 2D-sw culture , cyclosporine A and amiodarone presented clear cholestatic liabilities in all four PHH donors tested , whereas differences in the susceptibility of the various PHH donors towards the cholestatic toxicity of bosentan , chlorpromazine and troglitazone were observed. In PHH from one donor , the cholestatic liabilities of chlorpromazine and troglitazone could only be detected after long-term repeated exposures when maintained in 3D-spheroid culture , but not after short-term exposures in either 2D-sw or 3D-spheroid culture , suggesting that cholestatic hepatotoxicity may require time to develop. In conclusion , inter-individual susceptibility exists towards drug-induced cholestasis , which depends on the compound as well as the exposure time.
