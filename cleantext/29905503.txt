  The objective of this study was to compare antibacterial and smear layer removal efficacy of the erbium: yttrium-aluminium-garnet ( Er: YAG) laser irradiation by photon-induced photoacoustic streaming ( PIPS) , neodymium: yttrium-aluminium-garnet ( Nd: YAG) , and diode lasers and conventional irrigation agent in primary molar root canals. The selection , application , and activation of the irrigant are important factors affecting the success of the endodontic treatment. Distal root canals of human primary mandibular molar teeth used for antimicrobial efficacy evaluation were first inoculated with Enterococcus<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> ( n = 25). Smear layer removal efficacy was evaluated on the noninoculated specimens ( n = 20). The root canals in the first treatment groups were irrigated with a conventional technique using 5 % sodium hypochlorite ( NaOCl). In the laser groups , the root canals were irradiated with either Nd: YAG ( 1064 nm) or diode lasers ( 940 nm) followed by NaOCl irrigation agent. In the fourth groups , the NaOCl irrigation agent was activated with an Er: YAG laser ( 2940 nm) by PIPS tip using nonablative settings. Antibacterial efficacy was determined by viable counts of E.<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> after treatments. The treated root canals were examined by scanning electron microscopy to determine the smear layer removal efficacy of treatments. Statistically significant ( p < 0.05) reductions in the number of E.<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> were achieved in Nd: YAG and diode laser groups and Er: YAG laser by PIPS-activated irrigation groups compared to the NaOCl group. Er: YAG laser by PIPS-activated irrigation resulted in more cleaning of the root canal walls and a higher quantity of open tubules. These findings suggest that Er: YAG laser by PIPS-activated irrigation can be considered as an effective irrigant agitation technique in pediatric endodontics.
