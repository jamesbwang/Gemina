  Perfluorooctane sulfonate ( PFOS) is used extensively in industrial and household applications. High exposure to PFOS has been associated with increased odds of irregular and long menstrual cycles in women. However , the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Herein , we show that adult female mice appeared prolongation of diestrus and reduction of corpora luteum within a week of oral administration of PFOS ( 10 mg/kg) , which are associated with decreases in the levels of serum progesterone , LH and hypothalamic GnRH. The number of AVPV-kisspeptin neurons and the AVPV-kisspeptin expression were increased in proestrus mice or OVX-mice treated with high-dose estradiol benzoate ( 0.05 mg/kg) , which were suppressed by the administration of PFOS. The administration of PFOS or GPR54 antagonist P234 prevented the generation of LH-surge in OVX-mice treated with high-dose E2. In hypothalamic slices incubated in 100 nM E2 for 4 hours , the AVPV-kisspeptin expression was significantly enhanced , which was inhibited by PFOS in a dose-dependent manner or estrogen receptor α ( ERα) antagonist MPP , but not ERβ antagonist PHTPP. The incubation of ERα agonist PPT rather than ERβ agonist DPN could increase the level of AVPV-kisspeptin expression , which was sensitive to the treatment with PFOS. The administration of GPR54 agonist kisspeptin-10 in PFOS-mice could correct the prolongation of diestrus and reduction of corpora luteum , and recover the LH-surge and the levels of LH and GnRH. The results indicate that exposure to PFOS suppressed ERα-induced activation of AVPV-kisspeptin neurons leads to diestrus prolongation and ovulation reduction.
