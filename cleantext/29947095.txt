  The association of vascular dysfunction and amyloid beta deposition attracted attentions for its relationship with cognitive decline. Previous studies show the correlation between the declined cardiac function and the cognitive impairment. In the present study , we analysed the association between cognitive functions and cardiac parameters in community-dwelling people with preserved ejection fraction without heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Subjects were 108 Japanese community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults with preserved ejection fraction ( 25 men and 83 women; mean age 74.7 years). Cardiac functional parameters at rest were assessed with B-type natriuretic peptide and echocardiography. The cardiopulmonary exercise test was used to test these parameters during exercise. Cognitive function was assessed with the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA-J). Other indices were assessed biochemically , physiologically , and physically. There were significant correlations between MoCA-J score and age ( r = -0.388) , peak oxygen uptake ( VO These results suggested that peak VO
