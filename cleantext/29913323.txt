  In Eastern Europe and Central Asia new HIV<pathogen> infections occur at a high rate among people who inject drugs ( PWID). Injection risk behavior may be associated with injecting in public places. However , there is a lack of studies exploring this association in Ukraine , which has an HIV<pathogen> prevalence 21-42 % among PWID. Data came from a baseline survey of PWID recruited to participate in a behavioral HIV<pathogen> prevention intervention. The association between HIV/HCV injection risk behavior and place of injection ( private vs. public) was assessed using multivariable Poisson regression with robust variance estimate. Most of the sample was male ( 73 %) , > 30 years ( 56 %) , and reported opioids as their drug of choice ( 55 %). One in six participants ( 15.8 % , n = 57) reported using a syringe after somebody , and 70 % ( n = 253) reported injecting in public places within last 30-days. In the adjusted model , injection risk behavior was associated with injecting in public places ( PrR: 4.24 , 95 % CI: 1.76-10.20) , unstable housing situation ( PrR: 2.46 , 95 % CI: 1.26-4.83) , higher than secondary education ( PrR: 1.82 , 95 % CI: 1.04-3.16) , injecting with a sex partner day ( PrR: 2.13 , 95 % CI: 1.28-3.56) , and injecting with a stranger ( PrR: 1.47 , 95 % CI: 0.93-2.31). Injecting in a public place is associated with increased prevalence of risky behavior. Therefore , understanding and addressing place-based context should be part of the national strategy to fight HIV<pathogen> and HCV in Ukraine. National programs would benefit from expanding models to include contextual and structural determinants of health.
