  To evaluate changes in sexuality in women treated with Ulipristal acetate ( UPA) due to symptomatic uterine fibroids. A total of 102 women with symptomatic uterine fibroids undergoing conservative therapy with UPA were enrolled in this observational study. Sexuality was evaluated before and after a three month UPA treatment using the Female Sexual Functioning Index ( FSFI) as well as the Sexual Activity Questionnaire ( SAQ). Before treatment was initiated , participants additionally filled in a standardised questionnaire addressing the expected changes in sexuality due to UPA. Demographic parameters , expectations concerning changes in sexuality , and FSFI- and SAQ-scores were analysed. The average age of the study collective was 42.3 years. For the majority of the included women ( n = 70; 71.4 %) sexuality was rated as an important issue and 86 women ( 87.8 %) did not think that UPA would have an impact on the frequency of sexual intercourse , the quality ( n = 91; 92.9 %) or frequency of orgasms ( n = 87; 88.8 %) neither sexual receptivity ( n = 88; 89.8 %). Full data sets were available for 73 patients ( 71.6 %). The FSFI showed significantly higher sub scores regarding desire ( 3.6 ± 1.2 vs. 3.9 ± 1.2; p = 0.0012) and arousal ( 4.2 ± 1.7 vs. 4.4 ± 1.9; p = 0.0151) as well as a higher total score ( 26.6 ± 9.0 vs. 27.4 ± 9.5; p = 0.0008) after UPA treatment. Regarding the SAQ a statistically significant difference regarding the subscore `` habit '' was found ( p < 0.0001) comparing pre with post interventional scores. Sexuality in general seems to be important for women with symptomatic uterine fibroids. As the treatment with UPA appears to improve sexuality , this circumstance can be mentioned in a pre-therapeutic counselling.
