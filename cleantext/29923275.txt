  It is unknown why professionals ' adherence to guideline recommendations on antipsychotic drug prescription in the intellectual disabilities care is insufficient. This study aimed to explore barriers and facilitators in the implementation and use of these recommendations. In-depth interviews with four intellectual disability physicians , two psychiatrists and five behavioural scientists were used to explore the implementation and use of guideline recommendations. Barriers in adhering to recommendations were lack of collaboration of different disciplines involved in the treatment of psychiatric and behavioural disorders and lack of enforcement of an appropriate monitoring of side- and treatment effects.

To facilitate the use of guideline recommendations , organizations should translate recommendations into organization-specific policies , involving physicians and behavioural scientists in this process , while simultaneously creating more practical and technological support.
