  Structured reporting has many advantages over conventional narrative reporting and has been advocated for standard usage by radiologic societies and literature. Traditional structured reports though are often not tailored to the appropriate clinical situation , are generic , and can be overly constraining. Contextual reporting is an alternative method of structured reporting that is specifically related to the disease or examination indication. Herein , we create a library of 50 contextual structured reports for neuroradiologists and emphasize their clinical value over noncontextual structured reporting. These templates are located in the On-line Appendix , and a downloadable PowerScribe 360 file may be accessed at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AlPUmfAXPzjkMFcHf7vGKF4Q-vIdpflT.
