  The current study addresses lack of knowledge about assessment and management of postpartum depression<symptom> ( PPD) among nurses and midwives in Saudi Arabia. A descriptive , cross-sectional design was used to recruit a convenience sample of 181 nurses and 143 midwives. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Nurses and midwives lacked knowledge about various aspects of PPD , including its definition , prevalence , symptoms , risk factors , screening tools , and treatment. Only one third of participants were confident in their ability to provide education for women about PPD. Participants ' self-confidence to educate women about PPD was significantly correlated with their level of knowledge about assessment and management of PPD. Continuing education is recommended for health care professionals to improve knowledge regarding PPD. Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of educational interventions on improving knowledge , practice , and self-confidence about PPD.
