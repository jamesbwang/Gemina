  Third generation sequencing technologies generate long reads that exhibit high error rates , in particular for insertions and deletions which are usually the most difficult errors to cope with. The only exact algorithm capable of aligning sequences with insertions and deletions is a dynamic programming algorithm. In this note , for the sake of efficiency , we consider dynamic programming in a band. We show how to choose the band width in function of the long reads ' error rates , thus obtaining an ( Formula: see text) algorithm in space and time. We also propose a procedure to decide whether this algorithm , when applied to semi-global alignments , provides the optimal score. We suggest that dynamic programming in a band is well suited to the problem of aligning long reads between themselves and can be used as a core component of methods for obtaining a consensus sequence from the long reads alone. The function implementing the dynamic programming algorithm in a band is available , as a standalone program , at: https://forgemia.inra.fr/jean-francois.gibrat/BAND_DYN_PROG.git.
