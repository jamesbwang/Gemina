  This work presents the results from simultaneous measurements of 222Rn in soil-gas by compact discs ( CDs) and diffusion chambers. The measurements were performed in three terrains with high , medium and low 222Rn-in-soil-gas concentrations. Good correlations between the CD measurements and the reference diffusion chamber measurements are observed. The results indicate that it is important to apply temperature correction in the CD measurements , in order to account for the actual temperature during the exposure of the CDs in the soil.
