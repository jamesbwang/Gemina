  Aberrant expression of leucine zipper- and sterile ɑ motif-containing kinase ( ZAK) observed in pathological human myocardial tissue is associated with the progression and elevation of hypertrophy. Our previous reports have correlated high levels of estrogen ( E2) and abundant estrogen receptor ( ER) α with a low incidence of pathological cardiac-hypertrophy and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> in the premenopause female population. However , the effect of elevated ERβ expression is not well known yet. Therefore , in this study , we have analyzed the cardioprotective effects and mechanisms of E2 and/or ERβ against ZAK overexpression-induced cellular hypertrophy. We have used transient transfection to overexpress ERβ into the ZAK tet-on H9c2 cells that harbor the doxycycline-inducible ZAK plasmid. The results show that ZAK overexpression in H9c2 cells resulted in hypertrophic effects , which was correlated with the upregulation of p-JNK and p-p38 MAPKs and their downstream transcription factors c-Jun and GATA-4. However , ERβ and E2 with ERβ overexpressions totally suppressed the effects of ZAK overexpression and inhibited the levels of p-JNK , p-p38 , c-Jun , and GATA-4 effectively. Our results further reveal that ERβ directly binds with ZAK under normal conditions; however , ZAK overexpression reduced the association of ZAK-ERβ. Interestingly , increase in ERβ and E2 along with ERβ overexpression both enhanced the binding strengths of ERβ and ZAK and reduced the ZAK protein level. ERβ overexpression also suppressed the E3 ligase-casitas B-lineage lymphoma ( CBL) and attenuated CBL-phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K) protein association to prevent PI3K protein degradation. Moreover , ERβ and/or E2 blocked ZAK nuclear translocation via the inhibition of small ubiquitin-like modiﬁer ( SUMO) -1 modification. Taken together , our results further suggest that ERβ overexpression strongly suppresses ZAK-induced cellular hypertrophy and myocardial damage.
