  Muscle-invasive bladder cancer represents approximately 25 % of patients diagnosed with bladder cancer and carries a significant risk of death. Oncolytic viruses ( OV) are novel antitumor agents with the ability to selectively replicate and lyse tumor cells while sparing healthy tissue. Thus , we explored the efficiency of the oncolytic , YB-1 selective adenovirus<pathogen> XVir-N-31 in vitro and in an orthotopic mouse model for bladder cancer by intramural injection under ultrasound guidance. We demonstrated that XVir-N-31 replicates in bladder cancer cells and induced a stronger immunogenic cell death than adenovirus<pathogen> wildtype by facilitating enhanced release of HMGB1 and exosomal Hsp70. The intratumoral delivery of XVir-N-31 by ultrasound guidance delayed tumor growth in an immunodeficient model , demonstrating the feasibility of this approach to deliver oncolytic viruses directly into the tumor.
