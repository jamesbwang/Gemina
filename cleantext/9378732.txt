  A poor soft tissue envelope often accompanies periprosthetic tibia fracture around a well-fixed total knee arthroplasty and the tibial stem leaves little room for screw fixation. This article describes the practicability and effectiveness of a novel surgical technique using circular hexapod external fixation , in patients with this clinical scenario. It was applied for fixation of periprosthetic tibia fracture in 2 patients. Contact between the external fixation pins and the prosthesis was avoided. Using a web-based software program , a gradual reduction in all planes was achieved. Adequate fixation , stability , reduction , and quick healing were obtained in the 2 cases , with minimal complications. The patients returned to their activity level a few months after external fixation removal.
