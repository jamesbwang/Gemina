  Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery ( LARS) aims to provide relief from gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GORD). With increase in the prevalence of obesity , there is a concurrent increase in obese patients requiring LARS. In addition to being a more technically difficult procedure , there is conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of LARS in obese patients. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the outcomes of LARS in obese versus non-obese patients. Articles on the effects of obesity on LARS were identified from Ovid Medline , EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases up to 30th of November 2016. Two independent searches were conducted. Data were extracted independently by two researchers. The primary outcome was recurrence , whilst the secondary outcome was operative time. Pooled data were statistically analysed using forest<disease> and funnel plots. Twelve studies ( 3346 patients) met the inclusion criteria , with 923 patients in the obese group and 2423 patients in the non-obese group. Based on a random effects model , there was a risk ratio of 1.36 ( 95 % CI 1.08-1.72 , p = 0.009) , if studies reporting recurrence objectively are analysed risk ratio of 1.53 ( 95 % CI 1.01-2.32 , p = 0.05) showing 53 % increased risk of recurrence for obese patients. Using a random effects model , the difference in operative time was 13.94 min ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 9.33-18.55 , p < 0.0001) , showing an increased operative time for obese patients. A meta-analysis of 12 studies showed that there was greater recurrence of GORD symptoms and longer operative time relating to LARS in obese patients compared to non-obese patients.
