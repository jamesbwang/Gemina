  The rational design of an efficient and inexpensive electrocatalyst based on earth-abundant 3d transition metals ( TMs) for the hydrogen evolution reaction still remains a significant challenge in the renewable energy area. Herein , a novel and effective approach is developed for synthesizing ultrafine Co nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes ( N-CNTs) grafted onto both sides of reduced graphene oxide ( rGO) ( Co@N-CNTs @rGO) by direct annealing of GO-wrapped core-shell bimetallic zeolite imidazolate frameworks. Benefiting from the uniform distribution of Co nanoparticles , the in-situ-formed highly graphitic N-CNTs@rGO , the large surface area , and the abundant porosity , the as-fabricated Co@N-CNTs @rGO composites exhibit excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER) activity. As demonstrated in electrochemical measurements , the composites can achieve 10 mA cm
