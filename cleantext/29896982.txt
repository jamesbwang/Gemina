  The objective of the study is to examine the association of auditory , vision , and dual sensory impairment with late-life depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms. Our study included 7,507 older adults from the National Health & Aging Trends Study , a nationally representative sample of U.S. Medicare beneficiaries. Auditory and vision impairment were determined by self-report , and depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms were evaluated by the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-2) and two-item Generalized Anxiety<symptom> Disorder Scale ( GAD-2) , respectively. Auditory , vision , and dual impairment were associated with an increased risk of depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms in multivariable analyses accounting for sociodemographics , medical comorbidity , and functional impairment. Auditory , vision , and dual impairment were also associated with an increased risk for depressive and anxiety<symptom> symptoms that persist or were of new onset after 1 year. Screening older adults with sensory impairments for depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> , and screening those with late-life depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> for sensory impairments , may identify treatment opportunities to optimize health and well-being.
