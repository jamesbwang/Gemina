  Adult stem cells in mammals are important for normal tissue renewal ( homeostasis) and regeneration after injury. In the past ten years , different types of homeostatic adult stem cells have also been identified in the genetically accessible fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster) , among which intestinal stem cells have taken centre stage. Recent studies provide evidence that adult fly tissues may also harbor quiescent stem cells , which can enter cell cycle upon injury to regenerate compromised tissue. Such damage-responsive stem cells have been described in flight muscles , the adult brain and in a narrow region of the fly hindgut. Strikingly , many mammalian tissues have also been shown to maintain quiescent , but regeneration-competent , stem cells. However , little is known about the injury-induced signals that lead to their activation. Here , we provide a brief overview of active and damage-responsive adult stem cells in the fruit fly and focus on injury-dependent signalling events. We highlight the potential of Drosophila to model damage-induced stem cell activation to deepen our molecular understanding of how dormant stem cells can be efficiently recruited for tissue repair after injury.
