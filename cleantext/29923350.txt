  Tremendous efforts have been directed at designing functional and well-defined 3D structures in recent decades. Many approaches have been devised and are currently used to create 3D structures , including lithography , 3D printing , assembly , and template-mediated ( natural or synthetic) methods. Natural scaffolds offer some unique traits , as compared to their artificial counterparts , presenting highly ordered , porous , identical , abundant , and diverse structures. Various organisms , such as viruses , bacteria , diatoms , foraminifera , and others , are used as templates to form 3D structures. Herein , advancements made in using the shell of marine microorganisms , diatoms , and foraminifera , as scaffolds for designing functional 3D structures are reported. Furthermore , a succinct overview of various synthetic methods used to coat these scaffolds with inorganic materials ( i.e. , metals , metal oxides , and metal sulfides) is provided. Finally , the use of such fabricated functional 3D structures in a wide range of applications , such as catalysis , sensing , drug delivery , photo-electrochemical uses , batteries , and others , is considered.
