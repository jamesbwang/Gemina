  Use projection-resolved OCT angiography to investigate the autoregulatory response in the 3 parafoveal retinal plexuses under hyperoxia. Prospective cohort study. Nine eyes from 9 healthy participants. One eye from each participant was scanned using a commercial spectral-domain OCT system. Two repeated macular scans ( 3 Ã— 3 mm Flow index and vessel density were calculated from the en face angiograms of each of the 3 plexuses , as well as from the all-plexus inner retinal slab. Hyperoxia induced significant reduction in the flow index ( -11 %) and vessel density ( -7.8 %) of only the deep capillary plexus ( Projection-resolved OCT angiography was able to show that the retinal autoregulatory response to hyperoxia affects only the deep capillary plexus , but not the intermediate capillary plexus or superficial vascular complex.
