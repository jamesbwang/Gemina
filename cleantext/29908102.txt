  To investigate the relationships between motor unit action potential amplitudes ( MUAP Ten males and 10 females performed a submaximal isometric trapezoid muscle action that included a linearly increasing , steady torque at 40 % maximal voluntary contraction , and linearly decreasing segments. Surface electromyographic decomposition techniques were utilized to determine MUAP Males exhibited greater slopes for the MUAP Sex-related differences in mCSA and MUAP
