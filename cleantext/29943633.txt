  OBJECTIVE To evaluate a fluorescence resonance energy transfer quantitative PCR ( FRET-qPCR) assay for detection of gyrA mutations conferring fluoroquinolone resistance in canine urinary Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates and canine urine specimens. SAMPLE 264 canine urinary E coli<pathogen> isolates and 283 clinical canine urine specimens. PROCEDURES The E coli<pathogen> isolates were used to validate the FRET-qPCR assay. Urine specimens were evaluated by bacterial culture and identification , isolate enrofloxacin susceptibility testing , and FRET-qPCR assay. Sensitivity and specificity of the FRET-qPCR assay for detection of gyrA mutations in urine specimens and in E coli<pathogen> isolated from urine specimens were computed , with results of enrofloxacin susceptibility testing used as the reference standard. RESULTS The validated FRET-qPCR assay discriminated between enrofloxacin-resistant and enrofloxacin-susceptible E coli<pathogen> isolates with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92. The assay accurately identified 25 of 40 urine specimens as containing enrofloxacin-resistant isolates ( sensitivity , 62.5 %) and 226 of 243 urine specimens as containing enrofloxacin-susceptible isolates ( specificity , 93.0 %). When the same assay was performed on E coli<pathogen> isolates recovered from these specimens , sensitivity ( 77.8 %) and specificity ( 94.8 %) increased. Moderate agreement was achieved between results of the FRET-qPCR assay and enrofloxacin susceptibility testing for E coli<pathogen> isolates recovered from urine specimens. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The FRET-qPCR assay was able to rapidly distinguish between enrofloxacin-resistant and enrofloxacin-susceptible E coli<pathogen> in canine clinical urine specimens through detection of gyrA mutations. Therefore , the assay may be useful in clinical settings to screen such specimens for enrofloxacin-resistant E coli<pathogen> to avoid inappropriate use of enrofloxacin and contributing to antimicrobial resistance.
