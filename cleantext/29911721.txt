  The orientation of poly ( ethylene oxide) ( PEO) crystallites developed in the nanochannels of anodic aluminum oxide ( AAO) membrane has been investigated. PEO was filled homogeneously into the nanochannels in the melt state , and the crystallization confined within the PEO nanorod thus formed was allowed to take place subsequently at different temperatures. The effects of PEO molecular weight ( MPEO) , crystallization temperature ( Tc) and AAO channel diameter ( DAAO) on the crystal orientation attained in the nanorod were revealed by 2-D wide angle X-ray scattering ( WAXS) patterns. In the nanochannels with DAAO = 23 nm , the crystallites formed from PEO with the lowest MPEO ( = 3400 g mol-1) were found to adopt a predominantly perpendicular orientation with the crystalline stems aligning normal to the channel axis irrespective of Tc ( ranging from -40 to 20 °C). Increasing MPEO or decreasing Tc tended to induce the development of the tilt orientation characterized by the tilt of the ( 120) plane by 45 ° from the channel axis. In the case of the highest MPEO ( = 95000 g mol-1) studied , both perpendicular and tilt orientations coexisted irrespective of Tc. Coexistent orientation was always observed in the channels with a larger diameter ( DAAO = 89 nm) irrespective of MPEO and Tc. Compared with the previous results of the crystal orientation attained in nanotubes templated by the preferential wetting of the channel walls by PEO , the window of the perpendicular crystal orientation in the nanorod was much narrower due to its weaker confinement effect imposed on the crystal growth than that set by the nanotube.
