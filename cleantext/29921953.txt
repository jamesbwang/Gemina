  The Cochet-Bonnet ( COBO) aesthesiometer is the current standard in corneal sensitivity assessment. This study investigates the influence of ambient room humidity levels on the stimulus force exerted by the instrument. A COBO instrument ( Luneau Opthalmologie) with 0.12 mm nominal nylon filament diameter was placed in an environment chamber ( Electro-tech systems Inc.. PA , USA) at 25 °C and relative humidity ( % RH) set to either 20-80 % , in 10 % steps. After 12 h in the chamber at a chosen % RH level , the instrument was removed and exerted force measured by pressing the nylon filament onto the plate of an analytical microbalance ( Mettler-Toledo AB265; precision ± 0.0001 g) at a perpendicular angle , by a predetermined amount. Exerted force onto the microbalance was recorded in grams for a specified filament length. Procedure was repeated for filament lengths 10-60 mm , in 5 mm steps. The instrument was returned to the chamber and procedure repeated 5 times , before repeating at the next % RH setting ( random order). Measurements at each filament lengths were compared using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey 's range test. A p-value < 0.05 denoted statistical significance. Significant differences in exerted force were observed with alteration in % RH levels for each filament length ( all p < 0.001). Exerted force decreased significantly with an increase in % RH for all filament lengths , with the average force decreasing by 15 % with each 10 % rise in % RH. This study confirms previous suggestions that the rigidity of the COBO nylon filament is affected by ambient room humidity levels , with implications on the stimulus force delivered by the instrument. A conversion table is provided for converting filament lengths to pressure for a range of relative humidity levels.
