  Substituted piperazines comprise a substantial proportion of the novel psychoactive substance market. Among the most widely abused piperazine compounds are meta-chlorophenylpiperazine ( mCPP) , tri-fluoromethylphenylpiperazine ( TFMPP) , and , especially , benzylpiperazine ( BZP) , which are commonly incorporated , either alone or in combination , in illicit `` party pills '' or `` ecstasy '' formulations. Illicit synthesis of BZP often results in production of an impure by-product dibenzylpiperazine ( DBZP) , which frequently appears alongside BZP in these formulations; however , despite its ubiquity , little information exists regarding the abuse liability of DBZP. The current study aimed to evaluate the abuse-related behavioral pharmacology of DBZP. DBZP , mCPP , and TFMPP were tested in parallel in mice in locomotor activity and conditioned place preference assays , and in a drug discrimination assay with rats trained to discriminate either methamphetamine , cocaine , ( Â±) -3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA) , or -2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine ( DOM). Each of the compounds tested produced dose-dependent decreases in locomotor activity. DBZP substituted fully for methamphetamine , produced subthreshold drug-appropriate responding for cocaine and MDMA , and failed to substitute for DOM. Conversely , TFMPP and mCPP only produced subthreshold drug-appropriate responding for methamphetamine and MDMA , respectively , and both compounds failed to substitute for cocaine or DOM. None of the compounds tested produced a place preference. DBZP produced convulsions<symptom> in rats at the highest dose tested. These data indicate that DBZP is more similar to BZP , albeit with lower potency and efficacy , than its serotonergic piperazine counterparts , and is a behaviorally-active compound with some abuse liability and potential for adverse health effects.
