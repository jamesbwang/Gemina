  Patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD) are exposed to both traditional ` Framingham ' and uremia related cardiovascular risk factors that drive atherosclerotic and arteriosclerotic disease , but these can not be differentiated using conventional ultrasound. We used ultra-high-frequency ultrasound ( UHFUS) to differentiate medial thickness ( MT) from intimal thickness ( IT) in CKD patients , identify their determinants and monitor their progression. Fifty-four children and adolescents with CKD and 12 healthy controls underwent UHFUS measurements using 55-70MHz transducers in common carotid and dorsal pedal arteries. Annual follow-up imaging was performed in 31 patients. CKD patients had higher carotid MT and dorsal pedal IT and MT compared to controls. The carotid MT in CKD correlated with serum phosphate ( p < 0.001 , r = 0.42) , PTH ( p = 0.03 , r = 0.36) and mean arterial pressure ( p = 0.03 , r = 0.34). Following multivariable analysis , being on dialysis , serum phosphate levels and mean arterial pressure remained the only independent predictors of carotid MT ( R2 64 %). Transplanted children had lower carotid and dorsal pedal MT compared to CKD and dialysis patients ( p = 0.02 and p = 0.01 respectively). At 1-year follow-up , transplanted children had a decrease in carotid MT ( p = 0.01) , but an increase in dorsal pedal IT ( p = 0.04) that independently correlated with annualized change in BMI. Using UHFUS , we have shown that CKD is associated with exclusively medial arterial changes that attenuate when the uremic milieu is ameliorated after transplantation. In contrast , after transplantation intimal disease develops as hypertension and obesity become prevalent , representing rapid vascular remodeling in response to a changing cardiovascular risk factor profile.
