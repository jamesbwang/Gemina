  Mimivirus ' genome includes parts of 5S , 16S and 23S ribosomal RNAs encoded by Acanthamoeba 's mitogenome , the giant virus ' host. Two non-exclusive hypotheses for rRNA remnants in giant viruses are examined: 1. mitogenomes invade viral genomes as they do for nuclear chromosomes ( producing numts); 2. megaviral genomes evolved from an ancestral mitogenome. Alignment analyses confirm mitochondrial , rather than alphaproteobacterial origins of megaviral rRNAs. Other mitogenes have likely megaviral homologues. These megaviral homologues coevolve to much larger extents than candidate rRNA homologues , suggesting rRNA decay in viruses. Megaviral mitogene homologues overall follow mitochondrial gene order , suggesting mitogenome ancestry. Ancestral synteny decreases with megaviral genome size , suggesting that subsequent mitogene insertions blur ancestral gene order. Putative defenses against DNA invasion conserve mitogene order in short megaviral genomes. Synteny between mitogenome and megaviral genomes confirms the RNA/DNA polymerase-homologies-based hypothesis that giant viruses have mitochondrial-like ancestors , viral rRNA remnants are corollary of mitogenomic origins of megaviral genomes. Note that giant viruses , mitochondria and bacterial spores all have double<symptom> membranes<symptom> , spores and viruses have protein coats. Mitochondria might occasionally form spore-like structures that drifted into megaviruses. These missing links could confirm mitogenome ancestry of giant viruses rather than giant virus ancestry of mitochondria.
