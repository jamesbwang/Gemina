  To analyze the perioperative nursing characteristics about severe periodontitis<disease> patients with immediate zygomatic implantation , and to summarize the clinical nursing experience. Preoperatively , all patients received psychological counseling , oral hygiene instruction , and periodontal care with necessary means after physical examination. Cooperative procedures were preformed between nurses and surgeon during operation. After operation , nursing interventions were given including wound<disease> care , pain control , ice compression , appropriate diet and close follow-up. All patients were successfully operated without serious complications. Favorable implant primary stability was achieved in each patient. No patient developed wound<disease> dehiscence , one patient had wound pain and one patient had minor facial swelling. Temporary restoration was conducted to restore occlusal relationship and masticatory function within 48 hours. Comprehensive nursing intervention during perioperative period is necessary and deserves to be applied for patients with severe periodontitis<disease> who are treated with immediate zygomatic implant surgery.
