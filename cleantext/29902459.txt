  In human skin , melanocytes and their neighboring keratinocytes have a close functional interrelationship. Keratinocytes , which represent the prevalent cell type of human skin , regulate melanocytes through various mechanisms. Here , we use a keratinocyte and melanoma co-culture system to show for the first time that keratinocytes regulate the cell surface expression of N-cadherin through cell-cell contact. Compared to mono-cultured human melanoma A375 cells , which expressed high levels of N-cadherin , those co-cultured with the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line showed reduced levels of N-cadherin. This reduction was most evident in areas of A375 cells that underwent cell-cell contact with the HaCaT cells , whereas HaCaT cell-derived extracellular matrix and conditioned medium both failed to reduce N-cadherin levels. The intracellular level of calcium in co-cultured A375 cells was lower than that in mono-cultured A375 cells , and treatment with a cell-permeant calcium chelator ( BAPTA) reduced the N-cadherin level of mono-cultured A375 cells. Furthermore , co-culture with HaCaT cells reduced the expression levels of transient receptor potential cation channel ( TRPC) 1 , -3 and -6 in A375 cells , and siRNA-mediated multi-depletion of TRPC1 , -3 and -6 reduced the N-cadherin level in these cells. Taken together , these data suggest that keratinocytes negatively regulate the N-cadherin levels of melanoma cells via cell-to-cell contact-mediated calcium regulation.
