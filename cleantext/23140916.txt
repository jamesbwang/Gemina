  The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of incorporating nanoparticles of silver ( NAg) and amorphous calcium phosphate ( NACP) into a self-etching primer of a resin cement on the microtensile bond strength of dentin , regarding the proven antibacterial feature of NAg and remineralizing effect of NACP. Flat<symptom> , mid-coronal dentin from 20 intact extracted human third molars were prepared for cementation using Panavia F2 .0 cement. The teeth were randomly divided into the four test groups ( n = 5) according to the experimental cement primer composition: cement primer without change ( control group) , primer with 1 % ( wt) of NACP , primer with 1 % ( wt) of physical mixture of NACP+N ag , and primer with 1 % ( wt) of chemical mixture of NACP+N ag. The resin cement was used according to the manufacturer 's instructions. After storage in distilled water at 37 ℃ for 24 h , the bonded samples were sectioned longitudinally to produce 1.0 × 1.0 mm beams for micro-tensile bond strength testing in a universal testing machine. Failure modes at the dentin-resin interface were observed using a stereomicroscope. The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey 's post-hoc tests and the level of significance was set at 0.05. The lowest mean microtensile bond strength was obtained for the NACP group. Tukey 's test showed that the bond strength of the control group was significantly higher than those of the other experimental groups , except for group 4 ( chemical mixture of NACP and NAg; Novel chemical incorporation of NAg-NACP into the self-etching primer of resin cement does not compromise the dentin bond strength.
