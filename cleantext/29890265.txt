  Carboxymethyl starches are added to food products for thickening or tablet binding/filling purposes. Although they lack toxicity , their synthesis creates the chemical byproduct diglycolic acid ( DGA) , which is difficult to eliminate and whose toxicity is in question. A rare case of an accidental direct exposure to extremely high concentrations of DGA in a person revealed that DGA has the potential to be toxic to several organs , with the kidneys and liver being the most affected organs. Given that DGA is present in our food supply as a chemical byproduct of carboxymethyl starch food additives , we sought to perform in vitro testing of its potential hepatotoxicity to help complement a recent in vivo rat acute dose-response study that also tested for the potential hepatotoxic effects of daily DGA ingestion by oral gavage over a period of 28 days. Using the HepG2/C3A cellular in vitro model , we tested how escalating doses of DGA exposure over 24 h could induce hepatotoxicity. Both in vitro and in vivo testing systems revealed that DGA is indeed a hepatotoxin once a certain exposure threshold is reached. The concordance of these models highlights the utility of in vitro testing to support and help predict in vivo findings.
