  Brain swelling after cardiac arrest may affect the ventricles. We aimed to investigate the prognostic performance of ventricular characteristics on brain computed tomography ( CT) in cardiac arrest survivors who underwent targeted temperature management ( TTM). This retrospective cohort study included adult comatose cardiac arrest survivors who underwent brain CT scan within 24 h after resuscitation and underwent TTM from 2014 to 2016. The ventricular areas ( lateral , third , and fourth ventricle) , distances between the anterior horns of the lateral ventricle ( LV) and the posterior horns of the LV , and maximal internal diameter of the skull were measured. Grey-to-white matter ratio ( GWR) , Evans ' index , and relative LV area were calculated. The primary outcome was a 6-month neurologic outcome. Of 258 patients , 176 ( 68.2 %) had an unfavourable neurologic outcome. GWR , LV area , third ventricle area , distance between the anterior horns of the LV , distance between the posterior horns of the LV , Evans ' index , and relative LV area were different between neurologic outcome groups. Evans ' index ( 0.683; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.623-0.739) and relative LV area ( 0.670; 95 % CI , 0.609-0.727) had higher value of area under the curve than the other ventricular characteristics and showed prognostic performance comparable with GWR ( 0.600; 95 % CI , 0.538-0.661). All ventricular characteristics and GWR were not independently associated with neurologic outcome after adjusting for covariates. Ventricular characteristics on brain CT were associated with 6 months neurologic outcome in cardiac arrest survivors. Ventricular characteristics were objective measures that had comparable prognostic performance with GWR.
