  β-Cyclodextrin ( β-CD) possess a hydrophobic inner cavity and a hydrophilic exterior surface. They exhibit excellent inclusion properties with the guest molecules that match cavity size , and β-CD-based materials drew widespread attention in electrochemical sensors. The hydroxy groups at the edge of the cavity can form hydrogen bonds and undergo electrostatic and dipole-dipole interactions with other molecules. This review ( with 109 refs.) reveals β-CD-based detection mechanisms from the viewpoint of the size/shape-fit concept , and summarizes the current state of multiple electrochemical sensors based on the use of β-CD and functionalized β-CD such as carboxymethyl-β-CD , mono- ( 6-ethanediamine-6-deoxy)- β-CD , hydroxypropyl-β-CD , thio-β-cyclodextrin , and others.
