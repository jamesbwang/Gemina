  It is essential that cells orchestrate gene expression for the specific niche that they occupy , and this often requires coordination of the expression of large sets of genes. There are multiple regulatory systems that exist for modulation of gene expression , including the adjacent-gene coregulation of the rRNA and ribosome biogenesis and ribosomal protein families. Both gene families exhibit a nonrandom genomic distribution , often clustered directly adjacent to another member of the same family , which results in a tighter transcriptional coordination among adjacent paired genes than that of the unpaired genes within each regulon and can result in a shared promoter that coordinates expression of the pairs. This nonrandom genomic distribution has been seen in a few functionally related gene families , and many of these functional pairings are conserved across divergent fungal lineages. To date , the significance of these observations has not been extended in a systematic way to characterize how prevalent the role of adjacent-gene coregulation is in transcriptional regulation. In the present study , we systematically analyzed the transcriptional coherence of the functional pairs compared to the singletons within all gene families defined by the Gene Ontology Slim designation , using
