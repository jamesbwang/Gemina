  Solute carrier membrane transporters ( SLCs) control cell exposure to small-molecule drugs , thereby contributing to drug efficacy and failure and/or adverse effects. Moreover , SLCs are genetically linked to various diseases. Hence , in-depth knowledge of SLC function is fundamental for a better understanding of disease pathophysiology and the drug development process. Given that the model organism Drosophila melanogaster ( fruit fly) expresses SLCs , such as for the excretion of endogenous and toxic compounds by the hindgut and Malpighian tubules , equivalent to human intestine and kidney , this system appears to be a promising preclinical model to use to study human SLCs. Here , we systematically compare current knowledge of SLCs in Drosophila and humans and describe the Drosophila model as an innovative tool for drug development.
