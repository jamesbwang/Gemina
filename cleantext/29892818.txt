  Thyroid hormone signaling is customized in a time and cell-specific manner by the deiodinases , homodimeric thioredoxin fold containing selenoproteins. This ensures adequate T3 action in developing tissues , healthy adults and many disease states. D2 activates thyroid hormone by converting the pro-hormone T4 to T3 , the biologically active thyroid hormone. D2 expression is tightly regulated by transcriptional mechanisms triggered by endogenous as well as environmental cues. There is also an on/off switch mechanism that controls D2 activity that is triggered by catalysis and functions via D2 ubiquitination/deubiquitination. D3 terminates thyroid hormone action by inactivation of both T4 and T3 molecules. Deiodinases play a role in thyroid hormone homeostasis , development , growth and metabolic control by affecting the intracellular levels of T3 and thus gene expression on a cell-specific basis. In many cases , tight control of these pathways by T3 is achieved with coordinated reciprocal changes in D2-mediated thyroid hormone activation D3-mediated thyroid hormone inactivation.
