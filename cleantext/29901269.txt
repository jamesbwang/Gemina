  The main goal of this work was to investigate the effects of implants coatings ' mechanical properties and morphology on the osseointegration. In order to produce different mechanical properties of coatings , two thermal spray techniques , high velocity oxy-fuel ( HVOF) and air plasma spray ( APS) were employed. Titanium pins were coated and implanted into the distal femurs and proximal tibias of fifteen New Zealand white rabbits , equally distributed in three study groups , and a total of twenty pins implanted in each group. Eight weeks after insertion , the rabbits were euthanized and the femur samples were taken out for biomechanical tests and tibia samples for histological evaluations of osseointegration. Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) results showed enhanced density and a better morphology of HVOF coatings , compared to APS samples , and X-ray diffraction ( XRD) characterized an enhanced crystallinity of HVOF coatings. Nanoindentation tests revealed greater hardness and elastic modulus of HVOF coatings , whereas greater tensile residual stress and more pronounced creep was observed for APS coatings. Neither in biomechanical tests , nor in the histological analyses , a significant difference was observed between HVOF and APS coated samples ( p > 0.05 , and p > 0.05 , respectively). The lack of significant difference between the HVOF and APS coated implants ' osseointegration rejected our hypothesis to have a more enhanced osseointegration due to a better morphology , as well as stronger mechanical properties of HA coatings.
