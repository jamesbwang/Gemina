  Two alternative flexible alkyne-linked thymine nucleosides ( propargyl-diethylene glycol- or undecyn-linked 5-hydroxymethyluracil derivatives) , as well as their phosphoramidites and triphosphates , were designed and synthesized. The nucleoside 3 '- O-phosphoramidites were successfully incorporated into oligonucleotides on a solid support , whereas the nucleoside triphosphates served as good substrates for polymerase synthesis of modified DNA , which underwent fast and efficient copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition ( CuAAC) reactions.
