  In hepatocyte nuclei , hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) genomes occur episomally as covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA). The HBV<pathogen> X protein ( HBx) is required to initiate and maintain HBV replication. The functional nuclear localization of cccDNA and HBx remains unexplored. To identify virus-host genome interactions and the underlying nuclear landscape for the first time , we combined circular chromosome conformation capture ( 4C) with RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. Moreover , we studied HBx-binding to HBV episomes. In HBV-positive HepaRG hepatocytes , we observed preferential association of HBV episomes and HBx with actively transcribed nuclear domains on the host genome correlating in size with constrained topological units of chromatin. Interestingly , HBx alone occupied transcribed chromatin domains. Silencing of native HBx caused reduced episomal HBV<pathogen> stability. As part of the HBV episome , HBx might stabilize HBV episomal nuclear localization. Our observations may contribute to the understanding of long-term episomal stability and the facilitation of viral persistence. The exact mechanism by which HBx contributes to HBV nuclear persistence warrants further investigations.
