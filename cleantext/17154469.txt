  Bis ( cyclo-carbonate) was successfully synthesized from D-sorbitol ( Sorb-BisCC) through an environmentally friendly process with dimethyl carbonate ( DMC) as a reactant. In agreement with green chemistry principles , solvent free reactions were catalyzed and took place at low temperature. The reaction yield was increased until 50 % , with the use of 1.3.5-triazabicyclo ( 4.4.0) dec-5-ene as catalyst and a continuous DMC feed<symptom> to limit the side-reactions or the loss of reactant by azeotropic flux with a reactional subsidiary product. The obtained Sorb-BisCC is a remarkable platform molecule which could compete with others polycyclic platform molecules ( isosorbide). Sorb-BisCC can be e.g. , used to synthesize different chemicals such as short and long polyols , or novel biobased non-isocyanate polyurethanes ( NIPU). Two Sorb-BisCC molecules have been coupled to obtain novel cyclic diols with pendant side chains. Polyether polyols were also obtained by anionic ring opening polymerization. According to the synthesis conditions , these synthetized polyether polyols range from partially to highly cross-linked materials. Finally , NIPU were synthesized with short and biobased fatty diamines. These different modifications and synthesis highlight the versatility of the Sorb-BisCC and demonstrated its high potential as building block. Sorb-BisCC can be considered as a platform molecule to open the way to different original and biobased chemical architectures.
