  An innovative procedure for the iodoperfluoroalkylation of alkenes/alkynes is described. These reactions , including iodotrifluoromethylations of alkenes , proceed very efficiently under low intensity UVA irradiation in deoxygenated methanol solutions containing catalytic amounts of NaCl or Bu4NCl. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the light-promoted homolytic cleavage of the Rf-I bond that initiates the reaction is facilitated by the halogen bonding interaction between RfI and chloride ions.
