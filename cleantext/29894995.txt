  Since the publication of the primate brain volumetric dataset of Stephan and colleagues in the early 1980s , no major new comparative datasets covering multiple brain regions and a large number of primate species have become available. However , technological and other advances in the last two decades , particularly magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) and the creation of institutions devoted to the collection and preservation of rare brain specimens , provide opportunities to rectify this situation. Here , we present a new dataset including brain region volumetric measurements of 39 species , including 20 species not previously available in the literature , with measurements of 16 brain areas. These volumes were extracted from MRI of 46 brains of 38 species from the Netherlands Institute of Neuroscience Primate Brain Bank , scanned at high resolution with a 9.4-T scanner , plus a further 7 donated MRI of 4 primate species. Partial measurements were made on an additional 8 brains of 5 species. We make the dataset and MRI scans available online in the hope that they will be of value to researchers conducting comparative studies of primate evolution.
