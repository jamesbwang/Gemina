  Anaplastic gangliogliomas at the cerebellopontine angle are exceptionally rare with only a few cases reported in the literature. We present the case of a 32- year old lady with histologically confirmed cerebellopontine angle anaplastic ganglioglioma. The tumor jutted in to the porus acusticus causing widening of the internal acoustic meatus and mimicked clinically as well as radiologically as vestibular schwannoma. This unusual appearance of anaplastic ganglioglioma has not been previously described in literature.
