  Nutritional information about human milk is essential as early human growth and development have been closely linked to the status and requirements of several macro- and micro-elements. However , methods addressing whole mineral profiling in human milk have been scarce due in part to their technical complexities to accurately and simultaneously measure the concentration of micro- and macro-trace elements in low volume of human milk. In the present study , a single laboratory validation has been performed using a `` dilute and shoot '' approach for the quantification of sodium ( Na) , magnesium ( Mg) , phosphorus ( P) , potassium ( K) , calcium ( Ca) , manganese ( Mn) , iron ( Fe) , copper ( Cu) , zinc ( Zn) , selenium ( Se) , molybdenum ( Mo) and iodine ( I) , in both human milk and milk preparations. Performances in terms of limits of detection and quantification , of repeatability , reproducibility and trueness have been assessed and verified using various reference or certified materials. For certified human milk sample ( NIST 1953) , recoveries obtained for reference or spiked values are ranged from 93 % to 108 % ( except for Mn at 151 %). This robust method using new technology ICP-MS/MS without high pressure digestion is adapted to both routinely and rapidly analyze human milk micro-sample ( i.e. less than 250 Î¼L) in the frame of clinical trials but also to be extended to the mineral profiling of milk preparations like infant formula and adult nutritionals.
