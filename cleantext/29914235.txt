  Background/aim: The central nervous system is one of the major targets in lead exposure. Biomarkers for the diagnosis and follow-up of lead exposure have not been identified. In this study , serum S100B , neuron-specific enolase ( NSE) , and glutamate receptor 1 ( GRIA1) levels were determined as possible biomarkers for lead neurotoxicity. Material and methods: Twenty-five subjects with chronic lead exposure and 25 controls were included in the study. NSE and S100B were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay with a Cobas E601 analyzer. GRIA1 levels were measured with an ELISA kit using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. Results: GRIA1 levels were significantly higher in the lead exposure group than in the control group. No significant differences for NSE , S100B , ALT , AST , or creatinine in sera were found between lead exposure and control groups. Conclusion: Subjects with chronic lead exposure are found to have increased glutamate receptor levels and do not seem to have glial or neuronal damage , which can be demonstrated with the elevation of NSE and S100B levels. GRIA1 levels might be used as a biomarker for the neurotoxicity of lead.
