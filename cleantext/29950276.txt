  To investigate the associated factors with the vibration threshold perception ( VPT) in patients with type 2 diabetes and to assess whether it is useful for detection of diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN). VPTs were measured with Vibration Sensory Analyzer ( VSA-3000) in 426 diabetic patients. The diagnosis of DPN was based on Neuropathy Symptom Score and Neuropathy Disability Score ( NDS). ROC curve analysis and multiple linear and logistic regressions were performed to investigate the associations between VPT and DPN. Values of VPT were progressively higher according to NDS stages. Age , height , diabetes duration , and mean cumulative HbA VPT , measured by an automatic device , shares common correlates with DPN and is strongly associated with its presence. VPT testing may be useful as a screening tool for DPN assessment.
