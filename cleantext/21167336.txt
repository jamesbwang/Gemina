  Low-level high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T ( hs-cTnT) increases in elderly population. In this study , the relationship between hs-cTnT level and all-cause death of elderly inpatients with non-acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( non-ACS) after discharge from the hospital was investigated. Non-ACS patients aged > 65 years admitted in the General Practice Wards and Department of Geriatrics of Fuxing Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University were enrolled in the study. The patients were grouped according to the tertiles of hs-cTnT levels. Biochemical markers , hs-cTnT , and amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were measured. The median follow-up period was 47 months , and all-cause deaths of the patients were observed. A total of 722 patients , including 473 males and 249 females , aged 65-98 ( 82.43 Â± 5.98) years were enrolled in the study. The level of hs-cTnT was found to be higher in males , and increased with age and comorbidities ( These findings suggest that low-level hs-cTnT was increased in elderly inpatients without ACS. They further highlight that baseline hs-cTnT level was associated with increased risk of all-cause deaths among patients after their discharge , and most deaths were from non-cardiovascular diseases.
