  Objective Automatic segmentation for biochemical cartilage evaluation holds promise for an efficient and reader-independent analysis. This pilot study aims to investigate the feasibility and to compare delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage ( dGEMRIC) hip<symptom> joint assessment with manual segmentation of acetabular and femoral head cartilage and dGEMRIC hip<symptom> joint assessment using automatic surface and volume processing software at 3 Tesla. Design Three-dimensional ( 3D) dGEMRIC data sets of 6 patients with hip-related pathology were assessed ( 1) manually including multiplanar image reformatting and regions of interest ( ROI) analysis and ( 2) automated by using a combined surface and volume processing software. For both techniques , T1
