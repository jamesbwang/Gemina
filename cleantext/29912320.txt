  Himalaya hosts a unique environment for microbial ecology. The present study aimed to explore the bioplastic producing bacterial communities along altitude gradient of Pangi-Chamba trans-Himalayan region. A total of 411 bacteria were isolated and 70 characterized at the molecular level for potential polyhydroxyalkanoates ( PHA) producers. The most abundant phylum for PHA synthesis was Proteobacteria ( 73 %) , followed by Actinobacteria ( 11 %) , Firmicutes ( 10 %) and Bacteroidetes ( 6 %). However , at the genus level , Pseudomonas and Janthinobacterium were dominantly reported. Also , the ability to synthesize PHA was reported for the first time for few genera such as Collimonas , Pseudarthrobacter<pathogen> and Paenarthrobacter. Phylogenetic analysis of partial 16S rDNA and phaC genes revealed conservation in phaC and possibility of horizontal gene transfer among distant taxa. Furthermore , GC-MS also confirmed the ability of potential bacterial isolates to synthesize PHA. In fact , we found that PHA-positive bacteria are dominant in the high altitude of Himalaya , suggesting the vital role of PHA in bacterial adaptation and survival. Together , these findings had revealed the rich bacterial diversity and genetic machinery for PHA synthesis which does have potential for further utilization in the commercial applications.
