  The site-specific cross-linking of functional proteins creates macromolecular assemblies that exhibit unique biochemical and/or physicochemical properties. Herein , we explored the potential of laccase as a biocatalyst for the site-specific cross-linking of tyrosine-tagged proteins. Trametes sp. laccase ( TL) was selected as the cross-linking catalyst , and Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> alkaline phosphatase ( BAP) and antibody-binding proteins ( pG
