  Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor ( PMT) is a rare mesenchymal neoplasm associated with tumor-induced osteomalacia involving bone and soft tissue that produces paraneoplastic hypophosphatemic osteomalacia. The common physiologic defect in this conditions involves an impairment in renal tubular phosphate reabsorption with a downregulation of renal 1Î±-hydroxylase activity , while calcium metabolism remains essentially unaffected. Microscopic features consist of spindle cells , multinucleated giant cells and calcifications embedded in a chondromyxoid matrix with variable cellularity and prominent vascularity. Approximately 95 % of PMTs involve the extremities and appendicular skeleton , with only 5 % occurring in the head and neck region. Localization in the head and neck is pretty uncommon , nose and paranasal sinuses are preferentially affected. Due to its rarity , the purpose of the study was to report a new case of PMT whose locations in temporomandibular joint was never reported in literature.
