  The environmental fate of major ( e.g. C , N , S , Fe and Mn) and trace ( e.g. As , Cr , Sb , Se and U) elements is governed by microbially catalysed reduction-oxidation ( redox) reactions. Mesocosms are routinely used to elucidate trace metal fate on the basis of correlations between biogeochemical proxies such as dissolved element concentrations , trace element speciation and dissolved organic matter. However , several redox processes may proceed simultaneously in natural soils and sediments ( particularly , reductive Mn and Fe dissolution and metal/metalloid reduction) , having a contrasting effect on element mobility. Here , a novel redox-stat ( R
