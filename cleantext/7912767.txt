  Venous ulcer<disease> is an extremely common aetiology of lower extremity ulceration , which affects approximately 1 % population in most of the countries , and the incidence rate increases with age and female gender. Proper assessment and diagnosis of both the patient and ulcer<disease> are inevitable in order to differentiate venous ulcers<disease> from other lower extremity ulceration and to frame an adequate and individualised management plan. Venous ulcers<disease> generally persist for weeks to many years and are typically recurrent in nature. This consensus aims to present an evidence-based management approach for the patients with venous ulcers<disease>. Various management options for venous ulcers<disease> include compression therapy , minimally invasive procedures like sclerotherapy and ablation techniques , surgical procedures , debridement and medical management with micronised purified flavonoid fraction ( MPFF). Compression therapy is the mainstay treatment for venous ulcer<disease>. However , in failure cases , surgery can be preferred. Medical management with MPFF as an adjuvant therapy to standard treatment has been reported to be effective and safe in patients with venous ulcer<disease>. In addition to standard therapy , diet and lifestyle modification including progressive resistance exercise , patient education , leg elevation , weight reduction , maintaining a healthy cardiac status and strong psychosocial support reduces the risk of recurrence and improves the quality of life in patients with venous
