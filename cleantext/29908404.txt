  Childhood maltreatment ( CM) is associated with an increased risk for the development of psychiatric and somatic diseases in later life. Individual risk and resilience factors may , however , influence how deep psychological stress gets under the skin. We hypothesized that the stress-related hormone cortisol and the attachment-related hormone oxytocin constitute biological factors that might moderate the biological sequelae and long-term health outcomes associated with CM. As biological outcome , we thereby focused on immunocellular oxygen consumption , which we previously found to be increased with a higher severity of CM experiences. In a study cohort of N = 49 postpartum women , we investigated the interaction between CM experiences , serum cortisol and plasma oxytocin levels , and the cellular oxygen consumption of intact peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC) by high-resolution respirometry. Regression analyses revealed a significant interaction between the severity of CM experiences and cortisol as well as oxytocin on cellular oxygen consumption of PBMC three months postpartum: higher cortisol levels were thereby associated with an increase in oxygen consumption related to basal mitochondrial respiration<symptom> and ATP turnover , while oxygen consumption related to basal mitochondrial respiration<symptom> and ATP turnover were reduced with higher oxytocin levels in individuals with higher CM severity. These associations were not seen among women with no or low CM experiences. Together , the results suggest that cortisol and oxytocin might be associated with opposite effects on CM-related alterations in the bioenergetic profile of peripheral immune cells.
