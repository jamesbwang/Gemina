  The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of nebivolol on nonadrenergic noncholinergic ( NANC) relaxation functions that are mediated by electric field stimulation ( EFS) in rabbit corpus cavernosum smooth muscle by comparison with other beta-adrenergic receptor blockers and show the level on which its effects through nitric oxide take place. After the effects of nebivolol on the isolated corpus cavernosum tissues that were contracted through the alpha-adrenergic pathway and application of L-NAME ' ( N
