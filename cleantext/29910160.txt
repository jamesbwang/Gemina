  During pregnancy , thyroid peroxidase ( TPO) antibodies may increase the risk of developing subclinical hypothyroidism ( SCH). Both conditions appear to be associated to maternal-fetal complications. The objectives of this study were to analyze if a relationship exists between TSH and TPO levels during pregnancy and the potential effects on gestational and perinatal complications , and to assess whether detectable , but not positive , TPO levels have an impact on development of gestational SCH. A prospective study was conducted at the Leon Health Area ( CAULE) , where universal screening for gestational thyroid dysfunction is performed between weeks 7-13 of pregnancy. Data on TSH and TPO levels and gestational and perinatal complications were collected for all 2016 deliveries. Positive TPO antibodies were defined as values â‰¥ 35IU/mL. In a previous study , a TSH level > 3.72 mU/L was established as the cut-off value for gestational SCH. Records corresponding to 1,980 deliveries at CAULE , 21 abortions<disease> , and 18 deliveries outside the hospital were analyzed. Of the 1,670 pregnant women screened ( 84.34 %) , 142 ( 8.50 %) had positive TPO antibodies and their presence was associated to diagnosis of SCH ( P < 0.01) and to significantly higher mean TSH levels ( 3.51 mU/L vs. 2.46 mU/L , P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in gestational or neonatal complications. In the group with undetectable TPO antibodies ( < 10lU/mL) , the mean TSH levels was slightly lower than in the group with TPO values ranging from 10-35 IU/mL , but the difference was not significant ( P = 0.89). Presence of positive TPO antibodies is associated to higher TSH levels and higher risk of gestational SCH , but does not increase the rate of maternal-fetal complications.
