  Although IL-4 is long associated with CD4 Th2 immune responses , its role in Th2 subset development in non-lymphoid tissues is less clear. We sought to better define IL-4 's role in CD4 Th2 responses by using transgenic mice that express a dual IL-4 AmCyan/IL -13 DsRed ( IL-4AC/ IL-13DR) fluorescent reporter on an IL-4-sufficient or IL-4-deficient background. Using primary Th2 immune response models against house dust mite or
