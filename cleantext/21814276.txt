  Shape transitions in developing organisms can be driven by active stresses , notably , active contractility generated by myosin motors<symptom>. The mechanisms generating tissue folding are typically studied in epithelia. There , the interaction between cells is also coupled to an elastic substrate , presenting a major difficulty for studying contraction induced folding. Here we study the contraction and buckling of active , initially homogeneous , thin elastic actomyosin networks isolated from bounding surfaces. The network behaves as a poroelastic material , where a flow of fluid is generated during contraction. Contraction starts at the system boundaries , proceeds into the bulk , and eventually leads to spontaneous buckling of the sheet at the periphery. The buckling instability resulted from system self-organization and from the spontaneous emergence of density gradients driven by the active contractility. The buckling wavelength increases linearly with sheet thickness. Our system offers a well-controlled way to study mechanically induced , spontaneous shape transitions in active matter.
