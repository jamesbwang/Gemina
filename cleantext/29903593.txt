  A vascular leiomyoma is a vascular soft tissue tumor that is relatively rare and benign. They usually occur as solitary lesions<symptom> and are well encapsulated. The present study describes a unique case of vascular leiomyoma causing erosions of a metatarsal secondary to compression from the tumor. We present a female in her fourth decade of life with osseous malformations of the third metatarsal that became painful after an acute trauma to the foot.
