  Small for gestational age children ( SGA) is born on term with BW and or BL of -2.0 standard deviation score ( SDS). SGA children have an increased risk of being short , developing DM , and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Often defects of To investigate whether the exon 2 of the A cohort of 100 SGA children born in term was evaluated for alterations in Within our cohort , 64 SGA children were with short stature ( height SDS -3.25 ± 0.90 SDS) , and 36 were with normal height for their age and sex , ( H SDS was 0.20 ± 1.1 SDS). None of these children had microcephaly ( occipitofrontal circumference -0.70 ± 1.01 SDS vs 0.06 ± 0.56 SDS in SGA children with normal height) or dysmorphic features. The IGF1 serum concentrations and IGF1 SDS values of all children were within normal range. Only one child had lower normal serum IGF1 concentration. No alterations in exon 2 of The genetic analysis of the exon 2 of the
