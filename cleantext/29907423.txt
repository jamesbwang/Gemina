  Precision medicine methodologies and approaches have advanced our understanding of the clinical presentation , development , progression , and management of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) dementia. However , sex and gender have not yet been adequately integrated into many of these approaches. The Society for Women 's Health Research Interdisciplinary Network on AD , comprised of an expert panel of scientists and clinicians , reviewed ongoing and published research related to sex and gender differences in AD. The current review is a result of this Network 's efforts and aims to: ( 1) highlight the current state-of-the-science in the AD field on sex and gender differences; ( 2) address knowledge gaps in assessing sex and gender differences; and ( 3) discuss 12 priority areas that merit further research. The exclusion of sex and gender has impeded faster advancement in the detection , treatment , and care of AD across the clinical spectrum. Greater attention to these differences will improve outcomes for both sexes.
