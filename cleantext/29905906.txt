  We aimed to investigate the medial and inferior localization of orbit in patients with maxillary sinus hypoplasia using paranasal computerized tomography. We included 76 patients who had a hypoplastic maxillary sinus at least on one side , and 76 patients with normal maxillary sinuses ( control group). To assess the localization of orbit , we measured the distances from middle meatal antrostomy point to medial border of orbital medial wall and to the lower border of orbital floor in all patients. We performed statistical comparisons between the groups. Of 76 patients , 26 ( 34.2 %) had unilateral and 50 ( 65.8 %) had bilateral maxillary hypoplasia. Of 126 maxillary sinuses , 70 ( 55.6 %) was type 1 , 42 ( 33.3 %) was type 2 and 14 ( 11.1 %) was type 3 hypoplastic. The mean distance from antrostomy point to lamina papyracea was 4.36 ± 2.62 mm in the hypoplasia group , and 1.08 ± 1.7 mm in the control group. The mean distance from antrostomy point to orbital floor was 1.53 ± 1.73 mm in the hypoplasia group , and 1.87 ± 1.96 mm in the control group. Lamina papyracea showed a significant medial localization in the maxillary hypoplasia group as compared to the control group ( p < 0.001). The orbit has a medial localization in patients with maxillary sinus hypoplasia resulting in a higher complication risk during endoscopic sinus surgery.
