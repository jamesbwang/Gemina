  The contents and spatial distribution of mercury ( Hg) , including soil-Hg fractionation and Hg-containing native earthworm Bimastos parvus<pathogen> ( B. parvus<pathogen>) species , were investigated in the leachate-contaminated zone of a large traditional landfill , Japan. Soil-Hg was fractionated into 5 categories: F1/water soluble Hg ( Hg-w) , F2/human stomach acid soluble Hg ( Hg-h) , F3/organic-chelated ( Hg-o) , F4/elemental Hg ( Hg-e) , and F5/mercuric sulfide ( Hg-s). The total mercury ( T-Hg) and methylmercury ( MeHg) of native B. parvus<pathogen> , and the geochemical properties of soils were examined in this study. Soil T-Hg concentration ranged between 0.227 and 2.919 mg kg
