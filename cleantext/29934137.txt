  Radium-223 prolongs survival and decreases symptomatic skeletal events in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer and is indicated in patients with painful bone metastases. However , pain responses are rarely reported and often asked about by patients. Further , patients and their physicians are concerned about a lack of pain response portending a poor treatment response and may be inclined to change systemic therapies before completing 6 cycles. We evaluated the likelihood and time course of pain response , potential predictors of response , and its prognostic value in patients receiving radium-223. We reviewed the charts of patients who received radium-223 in our department. All patients were planned for 6 cycles with a prescribed dose of 50-55 kBq/kg at each administration. Pain scores , subjective response to pain , analgesic use , treatment toxicities , and laboratory values were recorded at each visit. Symptomatic skeletal events and survival were also recorded. 48 patients received at least one cycle of radium-223 and 27 ( 56 %) received all 6 planned cycles. Median survival from first treatment was 16.0 months ( 95 % CI 8.9 to 19.2 months). 33 % experienced at least one symptomatic skeletal event during or after treatment. 62.5 % of men reported a decrease in pain from pre-treatment baseline. Of men with improved pain , 96 % experienced an improvement before the third cycle. Pain relief was not associated with a decrease in ALK-P or PSA or improved survival. Approximately two-thirds of patients who undergo treatment with radium-223 will experience an improvement in pain and , if it occurs , it will most likely occur within the first two cycles. Patients should be counseled about this timeline and , if pain improvement is n't achieved , palliative radiation and oral analgesic readjustment should be considered. Pain response is not associated with survival and should not be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment.
