  Progesterone receptor ( PR) is expressed from a single gene as two isoforms , PRA and PRB. In normal breast human tissue , PRA and PRB are expressed in equimolar ratios , but isoform ratio is altered during malignant progression , usually leading to high PRA: PRB ratios. We took advantage of a transgenic mouse model where PRA isoform is predominant ( PRA transgenics) and identified the key transcriptional events and associated pathways underlying the preneoplastic phenotype in mammary glands of PRA transgenics as compared with normal wild-type littermates. The transcriptomic profiles of PRA transgenics and wild-type mammary glands were generated using microarray technology. We identified differentially expressed genes and analyzed clustering , gene ontology ( GO) , gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA) , and pathway profiles. We also performed comparisons with publicly available gene expression data sets of human breast cancer. We identified a large number of differentially expressed genes which were mainly associated with metabolic pathways for the PRA transgenics phenotype while inflammation<symptom>- related pathways were negatively correlated. Further , we determined a significant overlap of the pathways characterizing PRA transgenics and those in breast cancer subtypes Luminal A and Luminal B and identified novel putative biomarkers , such as PDHB and LAMB3. The transcriptional targets identified in this study should facilitate the formulation or refinement of useful molecular descriptors for diagnosis , prognosis , and therapy of breast cancer.
