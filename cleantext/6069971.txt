  Although the prevalence of sub-infertility in diabetic patients in childbearing age is known , the mechanisms by which diabetes mellitus ( DM) causes male infertility<symptom> are not completely explained. This detrimental effect is achieved with a variety of mechanisms that include pre-testicular , testicular , and post-testicular pathogenetic moments and can be different in type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM1) and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM2) patients because of type of diabetes , duration of disease , and glycemic metabolic compensation. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether diabetic disease can be considered a risk factor for infertility<symptom> considering the etiopathogenetic differences between DM1 and DM2 on sperm function. We enrolled 38 DM1 patients and 55 DM2 patients with idiopathic infertility<symptom> history > 12 months , and 100 healthy fertile subjects. The following outcomes were evaluated in optical microscopy and flow cytometry: sperm function ( by conventional and biofunctional sperm parameters) and signs of urogenital infection/inflammation ( by sperm leukocyte concentrations and indices of oxidative stress). Moreover , an andrological evaluation ( by didymo-epididymal ultrasound evaluation , serum total testosterone , LH , and FSH measurements) was performed in DM1 and DM2 patients compared to controls. Diabetic patients showed a higher risk of becoming infertile and the pathophysiological mechanisms of damage were different in DM1 and DM2. Conventional sperm parameters of diabetic patients are worse than controls (
