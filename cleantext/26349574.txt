  We evaluated the impact of structured surveillance using bioimpedance spectroscopy ( BIS) to reduce the rate of chronic breast cancer-related lymphedema ( BCRL) in high-risk patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND). From April 2010 through November 2016 , 93 patients who underwent ALND were prospectively monitored with BIS using L-Dex. Intervention for an L-Dex increase of > 10 consisted of applying an over the counter ( OTC) sleeve followed by re-evaluation after 4 weeks. The utilization of complex decongestive physiotherapy ( CDP) represented a surrogate for chronic BCRL. Median follow-up was 24 months. 55 % of patients received taxane-based chemotherapy , 24 % received some form of axillary irradiation ( includes additional fields or high tangents) and 66 % had an elevated body mass index ( BMI) with the median number of nodes removed being 19. Overall , 75 % of these patients had at least one additional high-risk feature ( taxane chemotherapy , axillary radiation , elevated BMI) , 48 % had at least two , and 6 % had all. Thirty-three patients ( 35.4 %) developed an elevated L-Dex score with only 10 ( 10.8 %) requiring CDP ( 30.3 % of those undergoing treatment with sleeve). At last follow-up , only three patients ( 3 %) had unresolved BCRL. The results of this analysis support previous data regarding prospective BCRL surveillance and early intervention using BIS. With this approach , only 3 % of patients have chronic BCRL.
