  Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) is important for maintaining healthy endothelium , which is crucial for vascular integrity. In this paper , we show that VEGF stimulates the nuclear translocation of endothelial differentiation-related factor 1 ( EDF1) , a highly conserved intracellular protein implicated in molecular events that are pivotal to endothelial function. In the nucleus , EDF1 serves as a transcriptional coactivator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPAR & gamma ;-RRB- , which has a protective role in the vasculature. Indeed , silencing
