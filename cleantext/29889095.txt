  Statistical noise may degrade the x-ray image quality of digital radiography ( DR) system. This corruption can be alleviated by extending exposure time of detectors and increasing the intensity of radiation. However , in some instances , such as the security check and medical imaging examination , the system demands rapid and low-dose detection. In this study , we propose and test a generative adversarial network ( GAN) based x-ray image denoising method. Images used in this study were acquired using a digital radiography ( DR) imaging system. Promising results have been obtained in our experiments with x-ray images for the security check application. The Experiment results demonstrated that the proposed new image denoising method was able to effectively remove the statistical noise from x-ray images , while kept sharp edge and clear structure. Thus , comparing with the traditional convolutional neural network ( CNN) based method , the proposed new method generates more plausible-looking images , which contains more details.
