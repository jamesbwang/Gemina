  In this paper , the terahertz ( THz) and infrared ( IR) characteristic absorption spectra of aqueous glucose solutions and aqueous fructose solutions with different concentrations were measured and studied. The absorption spectra of these two molecules in solid-state and in aqueous solutions were compared and analyzed , the significant effect of molecular adjacent environment on the molecular structure and vibrational mode was revealed. In addition , the THz and IR absorption spectra of these two isomers ' aqueous solutions were also compared and explored. No obvious differences were found from their IR absorption features measured at room temperature , while their THz absorption spectra do have the differences , indicating THz characteristic absorption spectra more suitable for the detection and identification of aqueous glucose and fructose solutions. The results are helpful to understand the influence of aqueous solutions environment on the molecular structures and vibrational modes of the materials , and also provide a theoretical reference for the quantum chemical calculation of biological macromolecules.
