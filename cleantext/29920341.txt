  Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers ( HBOCs) are an investigational replacement for blood transfusions and are known to cause oxidative damage to tissues. To investigate the correlation between their oxygen binding properties and these detrimental effects , we investigated two PEGylated HBOCs endowed with different oxygen binding properties- but otherwise chemically identical- in a Guinea pig transfusion model. Plasma samples were analyzed for biochemical markers of inflammation<symptom> , tissue damage and organ dysfunction; proteins and lipids of heart and kidney extracts were analyzed for markers of oxidative damage. Overall , both HBOCs produced higher oxidative stress in comparison to an auto-transfusion control group. Particularly , tissue 4-hydroxynonenal adducts , tissue malondialdehyde adducts and plasma 8-oxo-2 '- deoxyguanosine exhibited significantly higher levels in comparison with the control group. For malondialdehyde adducts , a higher level in the renal tissue was observed for animals treated with the high-affinity HBOC , hinting at a correlation between the HBOCs oxygen binding properties and the oxidative stress they produce. Moreover , we found that the high-affinity HBOC produced greater tissue oxygenation in comparison with the low affinity one , possibly correlating with the higher oxidative stress it induced.
