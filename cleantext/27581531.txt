  In a previous study , we found that titrating clopidogrel maintenance doses ( MDs) according to vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein ( VASP) monitoring minimised the rate of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events ( MACCE) after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) without increasing bleeding in patients with high on-treatment platelet reaction to clopidogrel. This study aimed to investigate whether VASP-guided clopidogrel MD could reduce thromboembolism and bleeding in atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) patients requiring anticoagulation and scheduled for PCI. AF patients scheduled for PCI were recruited between July 2014 and July 2016. These patients were allocated into VASP-guided ( n = 250) and control ( n = 253) groups depending on the clopidogrel MD profile. In the VASP-guided group , clopidogrel MD was titrated by the platelet reactivity index ( PRI) , whereas in the control group , clopidogrel MD was fixed at 75 mg per day. The primary endpoint was MACCE and secondary endpoints were thrombolysis in myocardial infarction ( TIMI) major and minor bleeding 1 year after PCI. Five hundred and three patients were included in the present study , with 1-year data available for 95.6 % patients. The average CHA In AF patients requiring anticoagulation and scheduled for PCI , VASP-guided antiplatelet therapy reduced major cardiovascular and cerebral adverse events , accompanied by increased minor bleeding events. The present study was retrospectively registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry , A Primary Registry of the International Clinical Trial Registry Platform , World Health Organisation ( Registration no: ChiCTR-IOR-17013854). The registered date was December 11 , 2117.
