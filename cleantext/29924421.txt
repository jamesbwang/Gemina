  Prolonged exposure ( PE) therapy is traditionally delivered individually to patients. To engage more veterans in care , an in vivo exposure group treatment was developed in an urban VA medical center. This treatment represented a modification of the in vivo exposure portion of PE , with the addition of in-session , therapist-assisted in vivo exposures. Here , we describe this 12-week treatment and present preliminary outcome data. Demographics and pre- and posttreatment scores on the PTSD Checklist-Specific ( PCL-S) and Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory-II ( BDI-II) were extracted from a program evaluation database. The sample included veterans with a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) who participated in the in vivo exposure group between October 2010 and March 2014 and had available treatment outcome data ( N = 43). The majority of participants in the sample were male ( n = 41 , 95.3 %) and Black ( n = 34 , 79.1 %). Participation in the in vivo group was associated with a significant decrease in PCL-S scores , with a medium-large effect size , t ( 42) = 5.35 , p < .001 , d = 0.73 , and a significant decrease in BDI-II scores , with a small effect size , t ( 38) = 2.55 , p = .015 , d = 0.23. Previous participation in an evidenced-based treatment ( EBT) was not associated with symptom change<symptom> following the in vivo group. Findings suggest that in vivo exposure group therapy constitutes a promising intervention for individuals who decline EBTs or remain symptomatic after completing an EBT for PTSD. Further study of this treatment using a randomized controlled trial design is warranted.
