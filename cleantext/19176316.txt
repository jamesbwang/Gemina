  Cytotoxic T lymphocyte<symptom> ( CTL) immunotherapy is an autologous cellular immune therapy that has been approved for treating patients with malignant tumors. However , there is still limited information regarding the impact of CTL on metastatic prostate cancer ( PC) patients with bone metastatic lesions<symptom>. An 82-year-old male patient complained of interrupted urination , urination pain , and significant dysuria on November 24 , 2014. Transurethral resection of the prostate ( TURP) and postoperative pathological examination showed prostatic adenocarcinoma , and a SPECT/CT scan demonstrated multiple bone metastases. In addition , prostate specific antigen ( PSA) and free PSA ( FPSA) levels were 54.54 μg/mL and 2.63 μg/mL , respectively , at the beginning of treatment. The man was diagnosed with prostatic adenocarcinoma and multiple bone metastases. The patient received 30 cycles of alloreactive CTL ( ACTL) immunotherapy regularly. Over the course of the 2-year treatment , the PC patient exhibited diminished bone metastasis accompanied by a marked reduction of serum PSA and FPSA from 54.54 and 2.63 μg/ml to 0.003 and < 0.006 μg/ml , respectively. Our clinical observations demonstrate that CTL immunotherapy is a viable treatment option for PC patients , particularly those with bone metastatic lesions<symptom> and high serum levels of PSA and FPSA.
