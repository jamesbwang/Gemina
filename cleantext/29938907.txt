  Inter-arm systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> differences ( SBP-DIFF) ≥ 10 mmHg have been reported useful to predict future cardiovascular-related morbidities. Although well studied in patients , there is little information on healthy young adults and the role of hand-dominance as a factor affecting SBP-DIFF. As dominant arms ( DOM) tend to have greater girth and muscle development than nondominant arms ( NDOM) it was reasoned that cuff pressures needed to obtain SBP may be greater on DOM causing DOM SBP to be greater. To test this hypothesis and also provide typical values , SBP was measured in left and right-handers ( 29 · 4 ± 10 · 4 years) in whom handedness was clearly defined. Handedness was determined by a multi-question form in 90 young adults ( 45 male) and SBP-DIFF determined via simultaneous measurements done in triplicate on seated subjects. The percentage of left-handers in male and female sub-groups were equal at 37 · 8 %. Results show that the absolute SBP-DIFF in left-handers ( mean ± SD) was 4 · 4 ± 3 · 8 mmHg and for right-handers was 5 · 0 ± 4 · 2 mmHg ( P = 0 · 362). There was also no statistically significant difference among 1st , 2nd and 3rd measured SBP-DIFF for either right or left-handers or differences between right and left-handers. Results show no evidence of a higher SBP in DOM and thus clarifies the hand-dominance issue as a factor not generally needing to be considered in clinical assessments. A potentially useful secondary outcome was the finding that 14 · 8 % of this group had at least one measured SBP-DIFF ≥ 10 mmHg a fact that may have future relevance.
