  In this paper , the crystalline modification of a rare earth nucleating agent ( WBG) for isotactic polypropylene ( PP) based on its supramolecular self-assembly was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry , wide-angle X-ray diffraction and polarized optical microscopy. In addition , the relationship between the self-assembly structure of the nucleating agent and the crystalline structure , as well as the possible reason for the self-assembly behaviour , was further studied. The structure evolution of WBG showed that the self-assembly structure changed from a needle-like structure to a dendritic structure with increase in the content of WBG. When the content of WBG exceeded a critical value ( 0.4 wt %) , it self-assembled into a strip structure. This revealed that the structure evolution of WBG contributed to the
