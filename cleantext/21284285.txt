  Synthetic chemicals ( environmental pollutants , food additives) are widely used for many industrial purposes and consumer-related applications , which implies , through manufactured products , diet , and environment , a repeated exposure of the general population with growing concern regarding health disorders. The gastrointestinal tract is the first physical and biological barrier against these compounds , and thus their first target. Mounting evidence indicates that the gut microbiota represents a major player in the toxicity of environmental pollutants and food additives; however , little is known on the toxicological relevance of the mucus/pollutant interplay , even though mucus is increasingly recognized as essential in gut homeostasis. Here , we aimed at describing how environmental pollutants ( heavy metals , pesticides , and other persistent organic pollutants) and food additives ( emulsifiers , nanomaterials) might interact with mucus and mucus-related microbial species; that is , & ldquo; mucophilic & rdquo; bacteria such as mucus degraders. This review highlights that intestinal mucus , either directly or through its crosstalk with the gut microbiota , is a key , yet underestimated gut player that must be considered for better risk assessment and management of environmental pollution.
