  This retrospective cohort study evaluated the relationship between antipsychotic medication adherence and emergency department ( ED) utilization for 7851 Medicaid patients with schizophrenia enrolled in Community Care of North Carolina ( CCNC). Claims and pharmacy data from January to December 2015 were collected. Medication adherence was approximated using the medication possession ratio ( MPR). Negative binomial regressions estimated the effect of antipsychotic adherence on rates of medical and psychiatric ED visits. The results demonstrated a statistically significant negative relationship between antipsychotic adherence and medical ED utilization. Non- and partially adherent patients ( MPR < 0.80) had 1.61 times the rate of medical ED visits as fully adherent patients ( MPR â‰¥ 0.80) ( 95 % CI: 1.50-1.74 , p-value < 0.001). The relationship between adherence and psychiatric utilization was small and not statistically significant. The most common diagnostic categories of ED visits were injuries and poisonings<disease> ( 16 %) , ill-defined symptoms ( 14 %) , and musculoskeletal conditions ( 12 %). This study demonstrates a clear association between antipsychotic adherence and medical ED utilization , suggesting an important link between psychiatric management and medical utilization in patients with schizophrenia.
