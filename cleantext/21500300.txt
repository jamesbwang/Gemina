  Polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF) shows piezoelectricity related to its & beta;- phase content and mechanical and electrical properties influenced by its morphology and crystallinity. Electrospinning ( ES) can produce ultrafine and well-aligned PVDF nanofibers. In this study , the effects of the presence of carbon nanotubes ( CNT) and optimized ES parameters on the crystal structures and piezoelectric properties of aligned PVDF/CNT nanofibrous membranes<symptom> were examined. The optimal & beta; content and piezoelectric coefficient ( d
