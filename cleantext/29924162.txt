  to determine the factors related to the risk of malnutrition in a non-institutionalized population over 75 years of age. a cross-sectional study was conducted using a questionnaire in a sample of 326 individuals over 75 years of age in Castell√≥n ( Spain) , during 2015 , and selected through intentional sampling. Malnutrition prevalence was 2.8 %. 26.9 % of the individuals were at risk of malnutrition , whereas women presented a higher rate ( 31.5 %). Women with a good overall health status showed a lower rate than men , 55 % and 69 % , respectively. Individuals that showed a lower risk of malnutrition are those with a positive perception than those who have a good overall health. Frail elderly people showed a higher risk of malnutrition ( 57.5 %) compared to non-frail subjects ( 20.2 %) p < 0.001. Frail women , self-assessed health , overall health , and use of health care services ( nursing consultation) were related to a higher risk of malnutrition.
