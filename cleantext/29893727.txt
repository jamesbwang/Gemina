  Fat , oil and grease ( FOG) deposits are an important contributor to blockages in building drainage systems. Such blockages bring undesirable financial , health and environmental costs , and thereby burden society. It is unclear to what extent the behavior of inhabitants , and more precisely domestic FOG disposal , affects the occurrence of FOG blockages. For this study , samples of FOG blockages were collected from building drainage systems ( kitchen drains and lateral house connections) and analyzed. The results showed that the deposits were calcium salts of fatty acids. Dissimilarities between the network locations demonstrate that , even at short distance , in-sewer transformation processes occur. Surveys were conducted to reveal information about FOG disposal patterns. Three households showed a clear link between the type of cooking oils used and the type of deposits collected.
