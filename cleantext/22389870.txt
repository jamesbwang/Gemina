  Development of neuroendocrine prostate cancer ( NEPC) is emerging as a major problem in clinical management of advanced prostate cancer ( PCa). As increasingly potent androgen receptor ( AR)- targeting antiandrogens are more widely used , PCa transdifferentiation into AR-independent NEPC as a mechanism of treatment resistance becomes more common and precarious , since NEPC is a lethal PCa subtype urgently requiring effective therapy. Reprogrammed glucose metabolism of cancers , that is elevated aerobic glycolysis involving increased lactic acid production/secretion , plays a key role in multiple cancer-promoting processes and has been implicated in therapeutics development. Here , we examined NEPC glucose metabolism using our unique panel of patient-derived xenograft PCa models and patient tumors. By calculating metabolic pathway scores using gene expression data , we found that elevated glycolysis coupled to increased lactic acid production/secretion is an important metabolic feature of NEPC. Specific inhibition of expression of MCT4 ( a plasma membrane lactic acid transporter) by antisense oligonucleotides led to reduced lactic acid secretion as well as reduced glucose metabolism and NEPC cell proliferation. Taken together , our results indicate that elevated glycolysis coupled to excessive MCT4-mediated lactic acid secretion is clinically relevant and functionally important to NEPC. Inhibition of MCT4 expression appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy for NEPC.
