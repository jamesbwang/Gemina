  The objective of this project was to develop a novel phosphorus removal system using steel slag filters applicable in decentralized applications and to propose design criteria about maintenance needs. Slag exhaustion<symptom> functions were measured on 2-3 mm , 3-5 mm , 5-10 mm and 16-23 mm slag. Three steel slag columns with particle size of 2-3 mm , 3-5 mm and 5-10 mm were fed with the effluent of an aerated lagoon during 589 days. A barrel reactor test was fed during 365 days with the effluent of an attached growth aerated biological reactor. The o-PO
