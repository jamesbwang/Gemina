  Corbicula fluminea , an Asian clam , is one of the worst invasive species in Europe that can survive in very adverse environmental conditions. Despite its negative impacts , the species also has the capacity to bioaccumulate heavy metals , contaminants and can be exploited for wastewater treatment purposes. The capacity of the Asian clam to remove Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , used as fecal contamination indicator , was analyzed. Conventional wastewater treatment plants are not suitable to remove bacteria , thus resulting in treated municipal wastewater with high bacterial loads. E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> clearance rate was analyzed as function of the number of clams. The bivalves can remove bacteria until concentrations below the detection limit in about 6 h. The adsorption on the clam shells ' and bioaccumulation on the soft tissues were also analyzed. The depuration of clams along 48 h were analyzed revealing that no bacteria was detected in the water. Thus , these results suggest that Asian clam can bioprocess E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. On the other hand , results obtained by this methodology were compared with ozonation and photocatalytic oxidation using TiO
