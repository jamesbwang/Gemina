  The applicability of compound-specific isotope analysis ( CSIA) for assessing in situ hydrolysis of parathion was investigated in a contaminated aquifer at a former pesticide wastes landfill site. Stable isotope analysis of parathion extracted from groundwater taken from different monitoring wells revealed a maximum enrichment in carbon isotope ratio of +4.9 â€° compared to the source of parathion , providing evidence that in situ hydrolysis took place. Calculations based on the Rayleigh-equation approach indicated that the natural attenuation of parathion was up to 8.6 % by hydrolysis under neutral and acidic conditions. In degradation experiments with aerobic and anaerobic parathion-degrading microbes , no carbon and hydrogen isotope fractionation of parathion were observed. For the first time , CSIA has been applied for the exclusive assessment of the hydrolysis of phosphorothioate-containing organophosphorus pesticides at a contaminated field site.
