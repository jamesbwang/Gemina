  Fibonacci or bifocal terahertz ( THz) imaging is demonstrated experimentally employing a silicon diffractive zone plate in continuous wave mode. Images simultaneously recorded in two different planes are exhibited at 0.6 THz frequency with the spatial resolution of wavelength. Multifocus imaging operation of the Fibonacci lens is compared with a performance of the conventional silicon phase zone plate. Spatial profiles and focal depth features are discussed varying the frequency from 0.3 to 0.6 THz. Good agreement between experimental results and simulation data is revealed.
