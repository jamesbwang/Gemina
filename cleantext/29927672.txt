  To explore the relationships between selected measures of motor impairments and activities involving the lower-limbs in ambulatory people with chronic stroke. Motor impairment measures included maximal isometric strength and motor coordination. Activity measures included walking speed , stair ascent/descent cadences , and the time to perform the Timed Up and Go ( TUG) test. Ninety individuals were included. The correlations between all motor impairment and activity measures were significant ( 0.18 < r < 0.52 , p < 0.05). Motor coordination and strength of the knee flexor muscles explained 30 % ( F = 20.3; p < 0.001) of the variance in walking speed , 32 % ( F = 19.1; p < 0.001) of stair ascent , and 31 % ( F = 16.8; p < 0.001) of stair descent cadence. Regarding the TUG , only motor coordination reached significance and explained 13 % ( F = 13.4; p < 0.001) of the variance. Measures of strength and motor coordination of the paretic lower limb were significantly correlated with all activity measures. However , despite the fact that knee flexor strength explained some variance in walking speed and stair ascent/descent cadences , motor coordination was the only measure that explained the variances in all three selected activity measures. These findings are innovative for neurological rehabilitation , since this is the first study to demonstrate that deficits in motor coordination of the paretic lower limb best explained limitations in performing different lower-limb activities.
