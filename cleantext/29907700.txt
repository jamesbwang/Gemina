  Pattern-recognition receptors ( PRRs) , which consist of receptor kinases ( RKs) and receptor-like proteins ( RLPs) , sense microbial- and host-derived molecular patterns associated with pathogen infection to trigger immune responses in plants. Several kinases of the 46-member Arabidopsis thaliana receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase ( RLCK) subfamily VII play important roles in pattern-triggered immunity , but it is unclear whether different RLCK VII members act specifically or redundantly in immune signaling. Here , we constructed nine higher order mutants of this subfamily ( named rlck vii-1 to rlck vii-9) and systematically characterized their immune phenotypes. The mutants rlck vii-5 , -7 , and -8 had compromised reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production in response to all patterns tested , indicating that the corresponding members are broadly required for signaling of multiple PRRs. However , rlck vii-4 was specifically defective in chitin-induced ROS production , suggesting that RCLK VII-4 members mediate the signaling of specific PRRs. Furthermore , RLCK VII-4 members were required for chitin-triggered activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK) , demonstrating that these kinases link a PRR to MAPK activation. Moreover , we found that RLCK VII-6 and -8 were also required for RK-mediated root growth. Together these results show that numerous RLCK VII members are involved in pattern-triggered immune signaling and uncover both common and specific roles of these kinases in plant development and immunity mediated by various RKs.
