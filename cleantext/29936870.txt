  The chemical investigation of the leaves and stem bark of Acacia polyacantha ( Fabaceae) led to the isolation of a new oleanane-type triterpenoid saponin named polyacanthoside A 1 together with fifteen known compounds. Their structures were established from spectral , mainly HRESIMS , 1D NMR and 2D NMR and by comparison with literature data. The cytotoxicity of compound 1 and the analogues 8 as well as doxorubicin was determined in a panel of 9 cancer cell lines including sensitive and drug resistant phenotypes. Unlike the analogue 8 , compound 1 as well as doxorubicin displayed cytotoxic effects in all the 9 tested cancer cell lines with IC
