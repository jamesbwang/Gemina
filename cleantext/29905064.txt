  We elucidate how nanocrystals `` bond '' to form ordered structures. For that purpose we consider nanocrystal configurations consisting of regular polygons and polyhedra , which are the motifs that constitute single component and binary nanocrystal superlattices , and simulate them using united atom models. We compute the free energy and quantify many body effects , i.e. , those that can not be accounted for by pair potential ( two-body) interactions , further showing that they arise from coalescing vortices of capping ligands. We find that such vortex textures exist for configurations with local coordination number â‰¤ 6. For higher coordination numbers , vortices are expelled and nanocrystals arrange in configurations with tetrahedral or icosahedral order. We provide explicit formulas for the optimal separations between nanocrystals , which correspond to the minima of the free energies. Our results quantitatively explain the structure of superlattice nanocrystals as reported in experiments and reveal how packing arguments , extended to include soft components , predict ordered nanocrystal aggregation.
