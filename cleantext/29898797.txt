  The Arizona Department of Health Services identified unusually high levels of influenza<disease> activity and severe complications during the 2015-2016 influenza<disease> season leading to concerns about potential increased disease severity compared with prior seasons. We estimated state-level burden and severity to compare across three seasons using multiple data sources for community-level illness , hospitalisation and death. Severity ratios were calculated as the number of hospitalisations or deaths per community case. Community influenza-like illness rates , hospitalisation rates and mortality rates in 2015-2016 were higher than the previous two seasons. However , ratios of severe disease to community illness were similar. Arizona experienced overall increased disease burden in 2015-2016 , but not increased severity compared with prior seasons. Timely estimates of state-specific burden and severity are potentially feasible and may provide important information during seemingly unusual influenza<disease> seasons or pandemic situations.
