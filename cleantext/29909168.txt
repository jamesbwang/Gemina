  This study analyzes whether there are time patterns in different intimate partner violence ( IPV) indicators and aims to obtain models that can predict the behavior of these time series. Univariate autoregressive moving average models were used to analyze the time series corresponding to the number of daily calls to the 016 telephone IPV helpline and the number of daily police reports filed in the Community of Madrid during the period 2008-2015. Predictions were made for both dependent variables for 2016. The daily number of calls to the 016 telephone IPV helpline decreased during January 2008-April 2012 and increased during April 2012-December 2015. No statistically significant change was observed in the trend of the number of daily IPV police reports. The number of IPV police reports filed increased on weekends and on Christmas holidays. The number of calls to the 016 IPV help line increased on Mondays. Using data from 2008 to 2015 , the univariate autoregressive moving average models predicted 64.2 % of calls to the 016 telephone IPV helpline and 73.2 % of police reports filed during 2016 in the Community of Madrid. Our results suggest the need for an increase in police and judicial resources on nonwork days. Also , the 016 telephone IPV helpline should be especially active on work days.
