  The present study aimed to prepare a small acute-phase cerebral infarction phantom made of gelatin and sucrose to simulate brain parenchymal cells , and a phantom made of collagen peptides and sucrose to simulate cerebral infarction for diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI). During the preparation of gelatin and sucrose mixture ( 17.0 wt % gelatin , 20.0 wt % sucrose) , a cylindrical wooden bar was placed in the center of the phantom and covered with a heat-shrinkable film to ensure space remained after gelling. A mixed solution composed of collagen peptide and sucrose ( 16.0 wt % collagen peptide , 27.5 wt % sucrose) was then enclosed within the space. The T
