  To estimate the association between problematic cell phone use and reasoning ability in adolescent. In a stratified cluster sampling design , problematic cell phone use and reasoning ability were evaluated in 929 college students from three universities for twice in one year 's follow-up investigation from June 2014 to May 2015. The cross-sectional analysis showed that the score of problematic cell phone use was significantly associated with the score of reasoning ability ( the baseline β = -0. 101 , 95 % CI-0. 168-- 0. 034; the follow-up in one year 's β = -0. 161 , 95 % CI-0. 255-- 0. 067). However , the score of problematic cell phone use on the baseline was not associated with the score of reasoning ability in one year late. Interestingly , after controlling of multiple confounding factors and the score of problematic cell phone use on the baseline , the scores of reasoning ability in one year late decreased 0. 40 points ( 95 % CI-0. 60-- 0. 20) , by the score of problematic cell phone use in one year lateincreased ten percent compared to that on the baseline. Higher problematic cell phone use is significantly associated with poorer reasoning ability in college students.
