  We compared sepsis<disease> `` time zero '' and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS) SEP-1 pass rates among 3 abstractors in 3 hospitals. Abstractors agreed on time zero in 29 of 80 ( 36 %) cases. Perceived pass rates ranged from 9 of 80 cases ( 11 %) to 19 of 80 cases ( 23 %). Variability in time zero and perceived pass rates limits the utility of SEP-1 for measuring quality.
