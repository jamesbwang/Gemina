  The phosphine phosphonic amide ligand platform is highly versatile , with three positions that can be independently tuned. In this contribution , we wish to study the nickel complexes based on this ligand system. Interestingly , the nickel dibromide and nickel allyl complexes are not active in ethylene polymerization. In contrast , the nickel phenyl chloride complexes are highly active in ethylene polymerization in the presence of a sodium tetrakis ( 3,5-bis ( trifluoromethyl) phenyl) borate cocatalyst. In addition , these nickel complexes can initiate ethylene copolymerizations with polar functionalized comonomers including methyl 10-undecenoate , 6-chloro-1-hexene and 5-acetoxy-1-pentene. More interestingly , these nickel complexes can oligomerize 1-hexene and 6-chloro-1-hexene.
