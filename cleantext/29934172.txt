  Gluten-free bakery products usually exhibit weak aroma. Their main constituents are flours and starches , which contain aroma precursors but can also contribute additional volatiles in low concentrations. Static headspace ( SHS) , solid-phase microextraction ( SPME) and solvent-assisted flavour evaporation ( SAFE) coupled to GC/QTOF were compared for their efficacy in the analysis of volatiles in corn starch. SPME-GC/QTOF was selected as the most suitable methodology based on the number of detected compounds , LODs , repeatability as well as simplicity. It was successfully applied for the quantification of volatiles in corn starch and qualitative comparison of different gluten-free flours. Hexanal , 3-methyl-1-butanol , 1-pentanol , 1-octen-3-ol , acetic acid , furfural , benzaldehyde , ( E) -2-nonenal , phenylethyl alcohol and short-medium chain acids were found in all the flours and corn starch. Quinoa flour and corn starch showed the highest contents of pyrazines , terpenes and esters , while teff , buckwheat and rice flours presented the highest contents of 3/2-methyl -1-butanol , acetoin and organic acids.
