  The aim of this experimental study was to investigate the role of the fibrous layer of the condylar head in the formation of temporomandibular joint ( TMJ) ankylosis in a sheep model of intracapsular condylar fracture. Six growing Xiao-wei Han sheep were used in the study , and bilateral TMJ surgery was performed in each sheep. In the left TMJ , sagittal fracture of the condyle , removal of the fibrous layer of the condylar head , excision of two thirds of the disc , and removal of the fibrous zone of the glenoid fossa were performed. In the right TMJ , the same surgical management was performed , except that in each sheep , the fibrous layer of the condylar head was preserved. Three sheep were killed humanely at 1 month postoperatively , and the other 3 sheep were killed humanely at 3 months postoperatively. The TMJ complexes were examined by histologic evaluation. Fibrous ankylosis was observed on the left side in 3 sheep at 1 month postoperatively and in 2 of 3 sheep at 3 months postoperatively. Fibro-osseous ankylosis was achieved on the left side in 1 sheep at 3 months postoperatively. In the right TMJ , the main postoperative histologic findings included condylar fracture healing , topical rupture or exfoliation of the fibrous layer of the condyle , and fissure between the fibrous layer and the proliferative zone of the condyle. However , no evidence of ankylosis was observed. The TMJ ankylosis scores on the right side were significantly lower than those on the left side at different time points ( P < .05). This study showed that the presence of the fibrous layer of the condylar head prevented the development of TMJ ankylosis in a sheep model of intracapsular condylar fracture.
