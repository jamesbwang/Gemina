  The G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 ( GRK2) plays a major role in cardiovascular diseases , and its expression is increased in heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. However , only little is known about factors being involved in up-regulation of GRK2 expression through transcriptional regulation of its promoter. Since the transcription factor early-growth response 1 ( EGR-1) is also up-regulated in patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , we tested the hypothesis that EGR-1 regulates GRK2 transcription. Stimulation of immortalized rat cardiomyocytes ( H9c2) with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA) resulted in up-regulation of Egr-1 and subsequently of Grk2 mRNA expression , with maximum Grk2 expression ( p = 0.008) 5 hr after PMA stimulation and being abolished by actinomycin D , indicating a transcriptional mechanism. To identify naturally occurring variants affecting promoter transcriptional activity , we identified a novel G ( -43) A polymorphism ( rs182084609) , which surrounded a putative EGR-1-binding site. While the minor A allele frequency was rare ( 0.02) , this variant was used to explore regulation by EGR-1 and promoter construct with altered alleles at nt-43 were subjected of reporter assays in human embryonic kidney cells ( Hek293). Here , EGR-1 over-expression resulted in a more than twofold increase in GRK2 promoter activity but only in the presence of the G-allele ( p = 0.04). In electrophoretic mobility shift assays , EGR-1 over-expression resulted in a specific binding of transcription factors only to the G oligonucleotide. Finally , EGR-1 over-expression resulted in increased GRK2 mRNA expression ( p = 0.03). We identified EGR-1 as a regulator of GRK2 transcription. Suppression of GRK2 expression by inhibition of EGR-1 binding to GRK2 might be a promising approach to mitigate adrenergic desensitization.
