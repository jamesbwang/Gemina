  Relapsed/refractory NB carries a bleak outcome , warranting novel treatment options. HaploHSCT induces a graft-versus-NB effect via natural killer cell alloreactivity. Review of patients with relapsed/refractory NB who underwent haploHSCT with ex vivo T-cell depletion in our unit from 2013 through 2018. Ten patients were identified ( male = 5; median age at haploHSCT = 6.45 y , range: 3.49-11.02 y). Indications were relapsed in 7 and refractoriness in 3; disease status at haploHSCT was CR in 2 , PR in 6 , and PD in 2. All patients received peripheral blood stem cell grafts after ex vivo T-cell depletion ( CD3/CD19-depletion = 1; TCR-αβ/CD19-depletion = 4; CD3/CD45RA-depletion = 4; and TCR-αβ/CD45RA-depletion = 1). Conditioning regimens were fludarabine-based. Neutrophils engrafted on median D + 10 ( range: D + 9 to +13) , and platelets engrafted ( ≥ 20 × 10
