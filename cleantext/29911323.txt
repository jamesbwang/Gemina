  Oxidative stress ( OS)- induced , p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p38MAPK)- mediated chorioamniotic senescence and inflammation<symptom> ( senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP)) are associated with parturition. In response to OS-inducing risk factors , premature senescence contributes to preterm premature rupture of the membranes<symptom> ( pPROM) and spontaneous preterm birth ( PTB). We determined the effect of simvastatin , rosuvastatin , and progesterone in downregulating p38MAPK-mediated senescence and SASP. Normal term , not-in-labor fetal membranes<symptom> ( n = 8) were exposed to cigarette smoke extract ( CSE: OS inducer) alone or combined with simvastatin ( 100 and 200 ng/mL) , rosuvastatin ( 100 and 200 ng/mL) , and progesterone ( 10 Compared to untreated controls , CSE induced p38MAPK-mediated senescence and SASP. CSE cotreatment with simvastatin and rosuvastatin significantly reduced p38MAPK activation , senescence ( decrease in SA-Î²-Gal) and SASP markers , GM-CSF , and TNF , but not IL-8 , while increasing anti-inflammatory IL-10 in a dose-dependent manner. Cotreatment of CSE and progesterone had no effect on reducing p38MAPK activation , senescence , or SASP. Both simvastatin and rosuvastatin downregulated OS-induced p38MAPK activation , senescence , and SASP , while rosuvastatin showed a pronounced effect. Progesterone did not reduce OS-induced fetal membrane senescence and SASP. Simvastatin or rosuvastatin may reduce the incidences of OS-associated PTB and pPROM by preventing premature senescence and SASP.
