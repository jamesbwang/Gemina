  Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo<symptom> ( BPPV) is the most frequent episodic vestibular disorder. It is due to otolith rests that are free into the canals or attached to the cupulas. Well over 90 % of patients can be successfully treated with manoeuvres that move the particles back to the utriculus. Among the great variety of procedures that have been described , the manoeuvres that are supported by evidenced-based studies or extensive series are commented in this review. Some topics regarding BPPV treatment , such as controlling the accuracy of the procedures or the utility of post-manoeuvre restrictions are also discussed.
