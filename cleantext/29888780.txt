  Fascins are a group of proteins taking part in the maintenance of a proper structure of the cellular cytoskeleton. Fascin-1 is an actin-bundling protein present in neurons , fibroblasts , endothelial , smooth muscle , dendritic and mesenchymal cells whereas lack of its expression is characteristic of epithelial cells. Fascin-1 overexpression can be observed in neoplastic cells. Therefore , the aim of this study was to assess the expression of Fascin-1 protein in patients with colorectal cancer ( CRC) and to analyze associations between Fascin-1 ex-pression and clinical-pathological parameters. The study material included postoperative samples ( tumor and unchanged colon tissue) ob-tained from 51 CRC patients. Fascin-1 expression was assessed in the paraffin sections by immunohistochemistry. A statistically significant correlation was found between the histological type of cancer and the expres-sion of Fascin-1 ( p = 0.012). Increased expression of Fascin-1 in CRC was more frequent in adenocarcinoma type without the mucosal component with a better prognosis and decreased expression of this protein correlated with infiltration of cancer cells to blood and lymphatic vessels ( p = 0.038). Our findings indicate a potential role of Fascin-1 in the pathogenesis of colon cancer; however , further studies will show whether this protein plays a role in the infiltration of colorectal cancer cells.
