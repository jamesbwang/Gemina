  Even 30 or more years after the end of a war , veterans can suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD). In the present study , we explored the influence on symptoms of PTSD among Iranian veterans of the Iran-Iraq war of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ( MBCT) as add-on to a standard treatment with citalopram. Forty-eight male veterans with PTSD ( mean age: 52.97 years) took part in this eight-week intervention study. Standard treatment for all patients consisted of citalopram ( 30-50 mg/day at therapeutic dosages). Patients were randomly assigned either to the treatment or to the control condition. Treatment involved MBCT delivered in group sessions once a week. Patients in the control condition met at the hospital with the same frequency and duration for socio-therapeutic events. At baseline and at study completion , patients completed questionnaires covering symptoms of PTSD , depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , and stress. At study completion after eight weeks , scores for PTSD ( re-experiencing events , avoidance , negative mood and cognition , hyperarousal) , depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , and stress were lower , but more so in the intervention than the control group. Data suggest that , as adjuvant to standard SSRI medication , MBCT is an effective intervention to significantly reduce symptoms of PTSD , depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , and stress among veterans.
