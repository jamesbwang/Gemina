  Pedal access has become an indispensable technique for endovascular therapy of complex lower extremity peripheral vascular disease. From an option as a single access in a patient lacking traditional access approaches to a critical maneuver in combined antegrade-retrograde approaches during the treatment of complex chronic total occlusions , pedal access is an essential tool for any endovascular physician treating peripheral arterial disease. Anticipatory planning is critical in the successful utilization of pedal access. The appropriate tibiopedal vessel should be chosen and combined with the ideal access technique. Knowledge of the current medical devices available for pedal access and post-procedural hemostasis is key and can ease the learning curve. We present the evolution of pedal access with a review of the literature and technical tips to incorporate into every day practice.
