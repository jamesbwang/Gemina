  Acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( AML) may be an epigenetically-driven malignancy because it harbors fewer genomic mutations than other cancers. In recent studies of AML in adults , DNA methylation patterns associate with clinical risk groups and prognosis. However , thorough evaluations of methylation in pediatric AML have not been done. Therefore , we performed an integrated analysis ( IA) of the methylome and transcriptome with clinical outcome in 151 pediatric patients from the multi-center AML02 clinical trial discovery cohort. Intriguingly , reduced methylation and increased expression of DNMT3B was associated with worse clinical outcomes ( IA
