  Deep space missions , including Mars voyages , are an important area of research. Protection of astronauts ' health during these long-term missions is of paramount importance. The paper authored by Szarka et al. entitled `` The effect of simulated space radiation on the N-glycosylation of human immunoglobulin G1 '' is indeed a step forward in this effort. Despite numerous strengths , there are some shortcomings in this paper including an incomplete description of the space radiation environment as well as discussion of the resulting biological effects. Due to complexity of the space radiation environment , a careful analysis is needed to fully evaluate the spectrum of particles associated with solar particle events and galactic cosmic radiation. The radiation source used in this experiment does not reproduce the range of primary galactic cosmic radiation and solar particle events particles and their associated energies. Furthermore , the effect of radiation interactions within the spacecraft shell and the potential effects of microgravity are not considered. Moreover , the importance of radioadaptation in deep space missions that is confirmed in a NASA report is neither considered. Other shortcomings are also discussed in this commentary. Considering these shortcomings , it can be argued that Szarka et al. draw conclusions based on an incomplete description of the space radiation environment that could affect the applicability of this study.
