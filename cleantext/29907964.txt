  Treatment of plantar<disease> warts<disease> is difficult and requires multiple treatments , and they are more refractory to treatment than common<disease> warts<disease>. Intralesional bleomycin has been used in the treatment of warts<disease> with varying degrees of success. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the efficacy of intralesional injection of bleomycin in the treatment of plantar<disease> warts<disease> based on clinical and dermoscopic observations. Bleomycin ( 1 mg/ml) was injected intralesionally into the pared plantar<disease> wart<disease> every 2 weeks for a maximum of four sessions. Patients were followed both clinically and by the use of dermoscope. The cure rate of plantar<disease> warts<disease> treated with bleomycin was 69.3 % with minimal and tolerable side effects. Intralesional injection of bleomycin is an effective and safe treatment of plantar<disease> warts<disease>. Dermoscope is recommended in the evaluation of treatment success , as it can accurately tell if the wart<disease> needs further treatment , preventing premature stoppage of the treatment , thus decreasing the possibility of recurrences.
