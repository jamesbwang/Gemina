  The number of elderly patients with psoriasis is steadily increasing in the Western world; nevertheless , they are frequently excluded from biological clinical trials and described as a high-risk group for adverse events. Thus , there is lack of information concerning safety and effectiveness of available treatments for psoriasis in the elderly , particularly about new biological systemic drugs. Our aim was to describe our experience with all biological therapies currently used in the elderly ( > 65 years) psoriatic patients. A retrospective multicentric review of clinical records of all psoriatic patient aged 65 years or older actually receiving biological drugs ( etanercept , adalimumab , infliximab , golimumab , certolizumab pegol , ustekinumab or secukinumab) was undertaken. Our study population included 266 elderly psoriatic patients actually receiving any biological therapy ( adalimumab 31.2 % , ustekinumab 28.9 % , etanercept 20.3 % , secukinumab 15 % , infliximab 3 % , golimumab 1 % and certolizumab pegol 0.6 %). The PASI score at the baseline ( week 0) ranged from 4 to 54; mean ± SD , 16.5 ± 7.1 , which changed after biological administration to 3.7 ± 8 at week 16 , 1.6 ± 2.1 at week 28 and 1.2 ± 2.1 at week 52. Among 266 elderly psoriatic patients , 25 adverse events were reported during the observation period. The most frequent events were infections with 12 ( 48 %) reports , followed by malignancies with four ( 16 %) reports. To date , our study represents the widest experience on the use of biological drugs in elderly psoriatic patients. We found that all biologics for psoriasis showed a great efficacy also in elderly people , and the rate and the type of adverse effects were similar to the younger patients. In conclusion , the age alone should not limit our therapeutic options. Further observational study using multiple data sources is needed to evaluate long-term effectiveness and safety for elderly psoriatic patients.
