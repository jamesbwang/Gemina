  Amblyopia can be improved or eliminated more easily when treated early in life. Because amblyopia in older children is generally less responsive to treatment ( Holmes et al. , 2011) , there is a premium on the early identification of amblyopia and its risk factors and the subsequent treatment thereof. Clinical preference is to institute treatment in children before 7 years of age when an optimal visual outcome is typically easier to obtain.
