  The marine fungus Emericella sp was isolated from the deep sea sediments. The fungus was identified by its morphology and ITS region. A new emerixanthone E ( 1) together with four ( 2-5) known emodin derivatives were isolated from the metabolites of the fungus Emericella SCSIO05240. The structures were elucidated on the basis of NMR spectroscopic analysis and mass spectrometry. The biological properties of those compounds ( 1-5) were explored for antimicrobial , antifungal and antitumor activity.
