  Interpretation of pediatric ECGs is limited by lack of accurate sex- and race-specific normal reference values obtained with modern technology for all ages. We sought to obtain contemporary digital ECG measurements in healthy children from North<pathogen> America , to evaluate the effects of sex and race , and to compare our results to commonly used published datasets. Digital ECGs ( 12-lead) were retrospectively collected for children ≤ 18 years old with normal echocardiograms at 19 centers in the Pediatric Heart Network. Patients were classified into 36 groups: 6 age , 2 sex , and 3 race ( white , black , and other/mixed) categories. Standard intervals and amplitudes were measured; mean ± SD and 2nd/98th percentiles were determined by age group , sex , and race. For each parameter , multivariable analysis , stratified by age , was conducted using sex and race as predictors. Parameters were compared with 2 large pediatric ECG data sets. Among ECGs from 2400 children , significant differences were found by sex and race categories. The corrected QT interval in lead II was greater for girls compared with boys for age groups ≥ 3 years ( In this large , diverse cohort of healthy children , most ECG intervals and amplitudes varied by sex and race. These differences have important implications for interpreting pediatric ECGs in the modern era when used for diagnosis or screening , including thresholds for left ventricular hypertrophy.
