  To form a new assessment method to evaluate postural workload comprehensively analyzing the dynamic and static postural workload for workers during their work process to analyze the reliability and validity , and to study the relation between workers ' postural workload and work-related musculoskeletal disorders ( WMSDs). In the study , 844 workers from electronic and railway vehicle manufacturing factories were selected as subjects investigated by using the China Musculoskeletal Questionnaire ( CMQ) to form the postural workload comprehensive assessment method. The Cronbach 's α , cluster analysis and factor analysis were used to assess the reliability and validity of the new assessment method. Non-conditional Logistic regression was used to analyze the relation between workers ' postural workload and WMSDs. Reliability of the assessment method for postural workload: internal consistency analysis results showed that Cronbach 's α was 0.934 and the results of split-half reliability indicated that Spearman-Brown coefficient was 0.881 and the correlation coefficient between the first part and the second was 0.787. Validity of the assessment method for postural workload: the results of cluster analysis indicated that square Euclidean distance between dynamic and static postural workload assessment in the same part or work posture<symptom> was the shortest. The results of factor analysis showed that 2 components were extracted and the cumulative percentage of variance achieved 65.604 %. The postural workload score of the different occupational workers showed significant difference ( P < 0.05) by covariance analysis. The results of non conditional Logistic regression indicated that alcohol intake ( OR = 2.141 , 95 % CI 1.337-3.428) and obesity ( OR = 3.408 , 95 % CI 1.629-7.130) were risk factors for WMSDs. The risk for WMSDs would rise as workers ' postural workload rose ( OR = 1.035 , 95 % CI 1.022-1.048). There was significant different risk for WMSDs in the different groups of workers distinguished by work type , gender and age. Female workers exhibited a higher prevalence for WMSDs ( OR = 2.626 , 95 % CI 1.414-4.879) and workers between 30-40 years of age ( OR = 1.909 , 95 % CI 1.237-2.946) as compared with those under 30. This method for comprehensively assessing postural workload is reliable and effective when used in assembling workers , and there is certain relation between the postural workload and WMSDs.
