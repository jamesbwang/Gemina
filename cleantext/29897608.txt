  Retrospective analysis of the neurodevelopment in the first two years of life in patients with severe congenital heart disease. Out of 89 patients with severe congenital heart disease 19 were excluded due to a history of prematurity and/or chromosomopathy , four due to a history of ischemic stroke and two due to lack of medical history. Denver Test ( DT) results at 2 , 6 , 12 , 15 and 18 months , and results in motor , language and social interaction fields were achieved. 59.4 % were male and 40.6 % female. The mean age of patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with pathological DT at 18 months was 3 months , compared to 11.88 months in those with normal DT. DT at 2 months was normal in 98.4 % of patients , 87.5 % at 6 and 12 months , 81.3 % at 15 months and 85 % at 18 months. Two patients with abnormal neurodevelopment normalized the DT before 24 months. The field of neurodevelopment most affected was language ( 15.6 %) , followed by motor ( 10.9 %) and social interaction ( 8 %). Psychomotor development delay , especially in the area of language , is more frequent in patients with severe congenital heart disease. The presence of cyanosis<symptom> and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were the variables that are most associated with this type of pathology.
