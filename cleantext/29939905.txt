  In older adults , the psychological impact and effects related to the loss of functional capacity are directly related to perceived quality of life ( QOL). The predictors of better QOL are increased physical activity , lower prevalence of overweight , lower cases of depression<symptom> , and lower rate of reported alcohol abuse. On the contrary , the predictors of decreased QOL are female gender , comorbidity , deficient nutritional condition , polypharmacy , loss of mobility , depression<symptom> and dependency , poor economic conditions , and social isolation and loneliness. Furthermore , QOL in older adults is more dependent on the number of falls than comorbidity. The objective was to investigate the determinants of perceived QOL among independent community-dwelling older adults and to quantify the influence of number of falls and number of risk factors on QOL. This is a cross-sectional study of 572 older adults ( > 70 years of age) seen in 10 primary care centers in La Ribera , Valencia , Spain. Comprehensive geriatric assessment was done by 4 nurses in primary care centers. Functional status and sociodemographic and clinical variables were collected. Quality of life was assessed by EQ-5D scale. Females predominated ( 63.3 %). Mean age ( standard deviation) was 76.1 ( 3.9) years. The male gender ( β = .09; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.05-0.13) was found to be predictive of better QOL , together with physical activity ( β = .04; 95 % CI: 0.02-0.06) , while the use of drugs affecting the central nervous system ( β = -.08; 95 % CI: -0.12 to -0.03) , overweight ( β = -.06; 95 % CI: 0.1 to- 0.02) , comorbidity ( β = -.09; 95 % CI: -0.13 to -0.05) , the presence of fall risk factors ( β = -.02; 95 % CI: -0.03 to 0.01) , and the number of previous falls ( β = -.03; 95 % CI: -0.06 to 0.01) had a negative impact upon the EQ-5D Index score. If perceived QOL is used as an indicator of the success of intervention programs , certain factors accompanying the adoption of measures for the prevention of falls may mask the results ( failure or success) of the intervention. Because most determinants of QOL are modifiable and physical activity has the potential to improve QOL , this research suggests that physical activity programs should be a component of health care for older adults.
