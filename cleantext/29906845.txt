  Through quantum molecular dynamics ( QMD) , utilizing both Kohn-Sham ( orbital-based) and orbital-free density functional theory , we calculate the equation of state of warm dense iron in the density range 7-30g/ cm ^ ( 3) and temperatures from 1 to 100 eV. A critical examination of the iron pseudopotential is made , from which we find a significant improvement at high pressure to the previous QMD calculations of Wang et al. ( Phys. Rev. E 89 , 023101 ( 2014) 10.1103/ PhysRevE .89.023101). Our results also significantly extend the ranges of density and temperature that were attempted in that prior work. We calculate the shock<symptom> Hugoniot and find very good agreement with experimental results to pressures over 20 TPa. These results are then incorporated with previous studies to generate a five-phase equation of state for iron.
