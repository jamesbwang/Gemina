  This study was to investigate prevalence of depression<symptom> among migrant hypertensive patients in primary care and to examine hypertensive patients ' social capital and its relationship with the prevalence of depression<symptom> An on-site-based cross-sectional study was performed in Shenzhen , China. A total of 830 migrant hypertensive patients completed the survey by using systematic sampling design. A questionnaire including information of depressive symptoms and social capital was administered by face-to-face interview surveys. We found that the prevalence of depression<symptom> was 11.0 % among migrant hypertensive patients in primary care. Social ties ( odds ratio = 1.197 , 95 % confidence interval: 1.034 , 1.387) and trust ( odds ratio = 2.061 , 95 % confidence interval: 1.342 , 3.165) were statistically significant associated with the prevalence of depression<symptom> Our study shows that the prevalence of depression<symptom> is high among migrant hypertensive patients in primary care. It also suggests an inverse association between social capital and depression<symptom> among migrant hypertensive patients. Although causal pathways between social capital and depression<symptom> can not be established by the present study , it is plausible to design and implement social interventions to improve mental health of migrant hypertensive patients in primary care.
