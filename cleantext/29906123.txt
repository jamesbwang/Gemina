  A regioselective metal-free preparation of 4-fluorosulfonyl 1,2,3-triazoles from organic azides and a hitherto underexplored bromovinylsulfonyl fluoride building block is described. This reaction is very general and was extended to the synthesis of various sulfonates , sulfonamides , and sulfonic acid derivatives of triazoles and other azole heterocycles which would otherwise be difficult to access by existing methods.
