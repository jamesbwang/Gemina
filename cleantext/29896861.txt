  Percutaneous mitral valve repair ( PMVR) is an interventional treatment option in patients with severe mitral regurgitation ( MR) who have a high risk for open-heart surgery. Currently , there is limited information about predictors of procedural success after PMVR. Galectin-3 ( Gal-3) and ST2 induce fibrotic alterations in severe MR and heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. The aim of the present study was to examine the predictive value of Gal-3 and ST2 as specific indicators of therapeutic success in high-risk patients undergoing PMVR. A total of 210 consecutive patients undergoing PMVR were included in this study. PMVR was performed using the MitraClip ® system. Procedural success was defined as an immediate reduction of MR by ≥ 2 grades as assessed by echocardiography. Venous blood samples were collected prior to PMVR and at 6 months follow-up for biomarker analysis. After PMVR there was a significant reduction in the severity of MR ( MR grade: 3 ( ± 0.3) vs. 1.6 ( ± 0.6); p < 0.001). Low baseline Gal-3 levels ( PMVR In the present study there was an association between low Gal-3 and ST2 plasma levels and successful MR reduction in patients with severe MR undergoing PMVR using the MitraClip System.
