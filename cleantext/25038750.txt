  The goal of this review is to provide updates on congenital ( neonatal) diabetes from 2011 to present , with an emphasis on publications from 2015 to present. There has been continued worldwide progress in uncovering the genetic causes of diabetes presenting within the first year of life , including the recognition of nine new causes since 2011. Management has continued to be refined based on underlying molecular cause , and longer-term experience has provided better understanding of the effectiveness , safety , and sustainability of treatment. Associated conditions have been further clarified , such as neurodevelopmental delays and pancreatic insufficiency , including a better appreciation for how these `` secondary '' conditions impact quality of life for patients and their families. While continued research is essential to understand all forms of congenital diabetes , these cases remain a compelling example of personalized genetic medicine.
