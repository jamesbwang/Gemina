  Academics have long called for greater interaction between gerontologists and legal scholars. However , prior studies have suggested that disciplinary borders remain a barrier to such interaction , hampering gerontology 's ability to function as a truly multi- or interdisciplinary field. This study was designed to understand the nature of current interactions between legal scholars and gerontologists , and to identify opportunities to advance scientific dialogue and cooperation between the two. Semi-structured , open-ended interviews with 27 participants ( 12 elder law scholars , 15 gerontologists) were conducted by phone , recorded , and analyzed by an interdisciplinary team. Both elder law scholars and gerontologists indicate that their field would benefit from research collaboration and cross-disciplinary teaching with the other field , but the fields remain distinct with little cross-disciplinary learning. Participants identified a series of opportunities , however , for increasing such learning and collaboration. The authors identify ways gerontologists can be encouraged to integrate elder law into their teaching and research , and suggest how this integration could enhance understanding of the aging experience.
