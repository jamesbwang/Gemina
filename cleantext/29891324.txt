  Amylose is a linear polymer formed by Î±-1,4 linkages and one of the major components of starch. It is often used to encapsulate hydrophobic molecules of health benefit , such as fatty acids ( FA) , flavonoids or polyphenols. Amylose and linoleic acid form a complex when the amylose molecule is folded in a V-type conformation. However , it is still not clear how amylose and linoleic acid interact with each other and what is the conformation of the complex adopts under different conditions. Molecular dynamics ( MD) simulation is a useful tool used to describe the structure of molecules and complex systems. In this work , MD simulations were used to illustrate conformational changes of the amylose-FA complex and the single amylose molecule , which was used as a reference , in water. During simulations , the conformation of the complex remained stable and the linoleic acid and the amylose molecules formed a helical structure. Furthermore , fatty acid molecules were located in cavity of the amylose helix with the hydrophobic tail inside it. Results also showed that
