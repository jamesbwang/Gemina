  Animals living in groups often form social hierarchies , with characteristic behaviours and physiologies associated with rank. However , when social opportunities arise and a subordinate ascends into a dominant position , quick adjustments are necessary to secure this position. Such periods of social transition are typically associated with elevated glucocorticoid production , but the precise regulation of the stress axis during these occasions is not well understood. Using the group-living cichlid , Neolamprologus pulcher , the effects of social ascension on the stress axis were assessed. Ascenders rapidly filled experimentally created vacancies , adopting a dominant behavioural phenotype within 72 h-elevating aggression , activity , and workload , while receiving high rates of affiliative behaviours from their group members. Despite assuming behavioural dominance within their groups , ascenders displayed higher cortisol levels than dominants three days post-ascension. Additionally , compared to subordinates , ascenders had increased transcript abundance of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein ( star) and cytochrome p450 side-chain cleavage enzyme ( p450scc) in the head kidney , indicating activation of the stress axis. Cortisol levels were lowest in ascenders that displayed low rates of aggression , potentially reflecting the reestablishment of social stability in these groups. Increased transcript abundance of both glucocorticoid receptors ( gr1 and gr2) in the brain 's preoptic area ( POA) of ascenders compared to dominants suggested an enhanced capacity for cortisol regulation via negative feedback. Our results reveal a regulatory cascade of behavioural and physiological interactions and highlight the importance of investigating the underlying mechanisms regulating the stress axis.
