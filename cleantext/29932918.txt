  The E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 146 ( RNF146) has been implicated in tumor development. However , the role and clinical significance of RNF146 in colorectal cancer ( CRC) remain unknown. In this study , we reported for the first time that RNF146 was upregulated in CRC tissues as well as in cell lines. Further , RNF146 expression was independent prognostic factor for poor outcome of CRC patients. RNF146 knockdown in cell lines inhibited cell growth , promoted cell apoptosis in vitro and suppressed colorectal tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigations revealed that RNF146 exerted oncogenic role through ubiquitination of Axin1 to activate β-catenin signaling. In addition , RNF146 expression was positively correlated with β-catenin expression in CRC tissues. Collectively , our data suggest that RNF146 might function as a oncogene in human CRC , and represent a promising prognostic factor and a valuable therapeutic target for CRC.
