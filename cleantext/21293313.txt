  Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell ( MSC) therapy is a promising treatment for several degenerative ocular diseases; however , no reproducible method of monitoring these cells into the eye has been established. The aim of this study was to describe successful bioluminescence imaging ( BLI) to detect viable luciferase-expressing MSC in the eye. Human donor MSC in culture were transduced with 50 μl luciferase lentiviral vector ( three viral particles/cell) prior to intraocular injection. Twenty-one right eyes of 21 rabbits were evaluated through BLI after receiving 1 × 10 Eyes injected with MSC showed high BLI radiance immediately after D-luciferin injection and progressive decay until 60 days. Mean BLI radiance measures from eyes with luciferase-expressing MSC were significantly higher than controls from 8 h to 30 days. At the thirtieth day , positive CD90- and CD73-expressing cells were observed only in the vitreous cavity of eyes injected with MSC. Viable MSC were identified in the vitreous cavity 1 month after a single injection. Our results confirmed BLI as a useful and reliable method to detect MSC injected into the eye globe.
