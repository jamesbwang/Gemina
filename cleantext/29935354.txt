  Cadherin-like and PC-esterase domain containing 1 ( CPED1) is an uncharacterized gene with no known function. Human genome wide association studies ( GWAS) for bone mineral density ( BMD) have repeatedly identified a significant locus on Chromosome 7 that contains the gene CPED1 , but it remains unclear if this gene could be causative. While an open reading frame for this gene has been predicted , there has been no systematic exploration of expression or alternate splicing for CPED1 in humans or mice. Using mouse models , we demonstrate that Cped1 is alternately spliced whereby transcripts are generated with exon 3 or exons 16 and 17 removed. In calvarial-derived pre-osteoblasts , Cped1 utilizes the predicted promoter upstream of exon 1 as well as alternate promoters upstream of exon 3 and exon 12. Lastly , we have determined that some transcripts terminate at the end of exon 10 and therefore do not contain the cadherin like and the PC esterase domains. Together , these data suggest that multiple protein products may be produced by this gene , with some products either lacking or containing both the predicted functional domains. Our data provide a framework upon which future functional studies will be built to understand the role of this gene in bone biology.
