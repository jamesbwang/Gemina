  Because of the limited success of population-based prevention methods and due to developments in genomic screening , public health professionals and health policy makers are increasingly interested in more individualized prevention strategies. However , the terminology applied in this field is still ambiguous and thus has the potential to create misunderstandings. A narrative literature review was conducted to identify how individualized , personalized and precision prevention are used in research papers and documents. Based on the findings a set of definitions were created that distinguish between these activities in a meaningful way. Definitions were found only for precision prevention , not for individualized or personalized prevention. The definitions of individualized , personalized and precision medicine were therefore used to create the definitions for their prevention counterparts. By these definitions , individualized prevention consists of all types of prevention that are individual-based; personalized prevention also consists of at least one form of- omic screening; and precision prevention further includes psychological , behavioral and socioeconomic data for each patient. By defining these three key terms for different types of individual-based prevention both researchers and health policy makers can differentiate and use them in their proper context.
