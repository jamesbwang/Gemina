  Methamphetamine ( METH) is a popular new-type psychostimulant drug with complicated neurotoxicity. In spite of mounting evidence on METH-induced damage of neural cell , the accurate mechanism of toxic effect of the drug on central nervous system ( CNS) has not yet been completely deciphered. Besides , effective treatment strategies toward METH neurotoxicity remain scarce and more efficacious drugs are to be developed. In this review , we summarize cellular and molecular bases that might contribute to METH-elicited neurotoxicity , which mainly include oxidative stress , excitotoxicity , and neuroinflammation. We also discuss some drugs that protect neural cells suffering from METH-induced neurotoxic consequences. We hope more in-depth investigations of exact details that how METH produces toxicity in CNS could be carried out in future and the development of new drugs as natural compounds and immunotherapies , including clinic trials , are expected.
