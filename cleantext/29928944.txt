  Endometritis<disease> is a puzzling disease that often associates with severe pelvic pain. In this study , we aimed to detect whether apigenin had protective effect against LPS-induced endometritis<disease> , if so , the underlying mechanism was further investigated. Apigenin was administrated 1 h before LPS treatment. The levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA. The expression of NF-κB and Nrf2 were detected by Western blot analysis. The results showed that LPS treatment induced severe histological alteration of uterus and this change was attenuated by the treatment of apigenin. Apigenin significantly attenuated LPS-induced MPO activity , MDA content , and inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β production. LPS-induced NF-κB activation was suppressed by apigenin. Furthermore , apigenin elevated the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in uterine tissues. In conclusion , the present study demonstrated that apigenin protected against LPS-induced endometritis<disease> through activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway and inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway.
