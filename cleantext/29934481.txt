  Understanding the real-world impacts of lifestyle modification ( LSM) for diabetes prevention is imperative to inform resource allocation. The purpose of this study was to synthetize global evidence on the impact of LSM strategies on diabetes incidence and risk factors in one parsimonious model. PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Library , and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for studies published between January 1990 and April 2015. Effectiveness/translation studies of any design testing LSM strategies , targeting high-risk populations ( with prediabetes or diabetes risk factors) , and reporting diabetes incidence , weight , or glucose outcomes were included. We extracted number of diabetes cases/incidence rates and mean changes in weight ( kg) , fasting blood glucose ( FBG , mmol/L) , 2-h postload glucose ( mmol/L) , and hemoglobin A Sixty-three studies were pooled in the meta-analysis ( Real-world LSM strategies can reduce diabetes risk , even with small weight reductions.
