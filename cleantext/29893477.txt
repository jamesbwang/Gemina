  In the present study , we evaluated the clinical , radiographic , and histological comparisons of completely autologous titanium-prepared platelet rich fibrin ( T-PRF) or allograft in sinus-lifting procedures. Eighteen posterior maxilla requiring sinus-lifting procedures using the balloon-lifting technique for implant placement were selected. Ten sinuses were randomly assigned to T-PRF as the test group and eight to allografts as the control group. After 4 and 6 months in the test and control groups , respectively , computed tomography was done , and bone samples were received during implant surgery. Three months after the second surgery , implant stability was measured. Radiological results showed that the allograft group had better results ( 62 % in volume , 53 % in density , and 69 % in height) than the T-PRF group. Histomorphometric results showed that newly-formed bone ratios were 17.28 ± 2.53 and 16.58 ± 1.05 in the allograft group and T-PRF groups , respectively. There was no significant difference between the test and control groups ( P = .611) for implant stability values. The use of T-PRF alone in sinus-lifting operations has successful clinical and histomorphometric results. Bone formation in the T-PRF group was accelerated to 4 months compared to allografts according to the histological results.
