  Transmembrane penetration of nanoparticles ( NPs) promises an effective pathway for cargo delivery into cells , and offers the possibility of organelle-specific targeting for biomedical applications. However , a full understanding of the underlying NP-membrane interaction mechanism is still lacking. In this work , the membrane penetration behavior of NPs is statistically analyzed based on the simulations of over 2.2 ms , which are performed with dissipative particle dynamics ( DPD). Influences from multiple factors including the NP concentration , shape and surface chemistry are taken into account. It is interesting to find that , the introduction of a partner NP would greatly facilitate the transmembrane penetration of a host spherical NP. This is probably due to the membrane-mediated cooperation between the NPs. Moreover , the proper selection of a partner NP with specific surface chemistry is of great significance. For example , the best partner for a hydrophilic NP to achieve transmembrane penetration is a Janus-like one , in comparison with the hydrophilic , hydrophobic or randomly surface-decorated NPs. Furthermore , such a partner-facilitating effect in NP translocation also works for a shaped NP although less pronounced. Our results are helpful for a better understanding of the complicated nano-bio interactions , and offer a practical guide to the NP-based drug delivery strategy with high efficiency.
