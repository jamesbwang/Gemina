  A three-dimensional ( 3D) prosthesis was designed and built for a red-lored Amazon parrot ( Amazona autumnalis) with a pre-existing amputation of the distal left leg at the tibiotarsal-tarsometatarsal joint and injuries to the right leg caused by cage companion aggression. The prosthesis consisted of a straight main imprint , with a round element at both ends to provide stability , and a bridge connecting this to a socket without a bottom where the stump could be accommodated and held securely with self-adhesive bandaging. Over a 4-month period , 3 different 3D prosthetic models were made and evaluated. The first model was fitted , but the parrot would only use the tip of the main imprint to stand and walk. The second model was designed with a semicircular imprint with only 1 round element at the cranial end , a different bridge to accommodate the change to the main imprint , and the same socket. With these changes , the parrot was able to place the imprint of the prosthesis on the floor to stand and move freely around its enclosure. To accommodate morphologic changes on the stump , a third model was created consisting of the same imprint and bridge , but the socket was cut vertically all the way on one side to allow distention<symptom> on its diameter and provide a long-lasting fit to the stump over time.
