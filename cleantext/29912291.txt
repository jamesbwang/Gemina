  DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that undergoes dynamic changes in mammalian embryogenesis , during which both parental genomes are reprogrammed. Despite the many immunostaining studies that have assessed global methylation , the gene-specific DNA methylation patterns in bovine preimplantation embryos are unknown. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing , we determined genome-scale DNA methylation of bovine sperm and individual in vivo developed oocytes and preimplantation embryos. We show that: 1) the major wave of genome-wide demethylation was completed by the 8-cell stage; 2) promoter methylation was significantly and inversely correlated with gene expression at the 8-cell and blastocyst stages; 3) sperm and oocytes have numerous differentially methylated regions ( DMRs)- DMRs specific for sperm were strongly enriched in long terminal repeats ( LTRs) and rapidly lost methylation in embryos; while , the oocyte-specific DMRs were more frequently localized in exons and CpG islands ( CGIs) and demethylated gradually across cleavage stages; 4) DMRs were also found between in vivo and in vitro matured oocytes; and 5) differential methylation between bovine gametes was confirmed in some but not all known imprinted genes. Our data provide insights into the complex epigenetic reprogramming of bovine early embryos , which serve as an important model for human preimplantation development.
