  We aimed to describe time<pathogen> trends<pathogen> in functional dyspepsia<pathogen> and the association<pathogen> of dyspepsia-related factors<pathogen> , Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori ( H.<pathogen> pylori) and work-related stress<pathogen> with functional dyspepsia<pathogen> in white collar<pathogen> employees<pathogen> in 1996 and 2015. Repeat<pathogen> cross-sectional study<pathogen> conducted in 1996 ( n<pathogen> = 190 , response<pathogen> rate<pathogen> = 76.1) and 2015 ( n<pathogen> = 195 , response<pathogen> rate<pathogen> = 40.2) within a health<pathogen> insurance<pathogen> company<pathogen> in South-West Germany. Dyspeptic symptoms<pathogen> measured according to the Rome III<pathogen> criteria<pathogen> , effort-reward imbalance<pathogen> and further work<pathogen>- or dyspepsia-related factors<pathogen> were assessed by self-administered questionnaire<pathogen>. H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection<pathogen> as possible factor<pathogen> for dyspeptic symptoms<pathogen> was measured by a 13C-urea breath<pathogen> test<pathogen> or an antigen<pathogen> stool<pathogen> test<pathogen>. Kruskal-Wallis tests<pathogen> and multivariable logistic regression<pathogen> models<pathogen> were calculated comparing the upper tertile<pathogen> of dyspeptic symptom<pathogen> scale<pathogen> to the middle and lower tertile<pathogen>. Mean<pathogen> dyspepsia<pathogen> symptom<pathogen> scores<pathogen> and work-related stress<pathogen> did not differ comparing 1996 and 2015. In bivariate analyses<pathogen> , dyspeptic symptom<pathogen> scores<pathogen> were consistently correlated with sex<pathogen> , age<pathogen> , and using antacids<pathogen>. Further dyspepsia-related factors<pathogen> were smoking<pathogen> and non-leading occupational position<pathogen> in 1996 and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs<pathogen> as well as high effort-reward imbalance<pathogen> in 2015. High intrinsic effort<pathogen> was positively associated with high dyspepsia<pathogen> symptom<pathogen> scores<pathogen> in both studies<pathogen>. Following multivariable adjustment<pathogen> , we observed a consistent association<pathogen> between high intrinsic effort<pathogen> at work<pathogen> and dyspeptic symptoms<pathogen> , although the association<pathogen> was only marginally statistically significant in 1996. Furthermore , a strong association<pathogen> of somatization<pathogen> , only measured in 2015 , with dyspeptic symptoms<pathogen> was shown. Dyspepsia-related factors<pathogen> may have changed throughout the last decades. Nevertheless , although occupational situations<pathogen> might differ , the intrinsic effort<pathogen> is still strongly associated with dyspeptic
