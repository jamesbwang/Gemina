  Actinobacteria from special habitats are of interest due to their producing of bioactive compounds and diverse ecological functions. However , little is known of the diversity and functional traits of actinobacteria inhabiting coastal salt marsh soils. We assessed actinobacterial diversity from eight coastal salt marsh rhizosphere soils from Jiangsu Province , China , using culture-based and 16S rRNA gene high throughput sequencing ( HTS) methods , in addition to evaluating their plant growth-promoting ( PGP) traits of isolates. Actinobacterial sequences represented 2.8 % -43.0 % of rhizosphere bacterial communities , as determined by HTS technique. The actinobacteria community comprised 34 families and 79 genera. In addition , 196 actinobacterial isolates were obtained , of which 92 representative isolates were selected for further 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The 92 strains comprised seven suborders , 12 families , and 20 genera that included several potential novel species. All representative strains were tested for their ability of producing indole acetic acid ( IAA) , siderophores , 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase ( ACCD) , hydrolytic enzymes , and phosphate solubilization. Based on the presence of multiple PGP traits , two strains , Streptomyces<pathogen> sp.. KLBMP S0051 and Micromonospora sp.. KLBMP S0019 were selected for inoculation of wheat seeds grown under salt stress. Both strains promoted seed germination , and KLBMP S0019 significantly enhanced seedling growth under NaCl stress. Our study demonstrates that coastal salt marsh rhizosphere soils harbor a diverse reservoir of actinobacteria that are potential resources for the discovery of novel species and functions. Moreover , several of the isolates identified here are good candidates as PGP bacteria that may contribute to plant adaptions to saline soils.
