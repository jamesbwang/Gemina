  Microplastics are an increasingly important contaminant in the marine environment. Depending on their composition and degree of biofouling , many common microplastics are less dense than seawater and so tend to float at or near the ocean surface. As such , they may exhibit high concentrations in the sea surface microlayer ( SML- the upper 1-1000 μm of the ocean) relative to deeper water. This paper examines the accumulation of microplastics , in particular microfibres , in the SML in two contrasting estuarine systems- the Hamble estuary and the Beaulieu estuary , southern U.K. , via a novel and rapid SML-selective sampling method using a dipped glass plate. Microplastic concentrations ( for identified fibres , of 0.05 to 4.5 mm length) were highest in the SML-selective samples ( with a mean concentration of 43 ± 36 fibres/L) , compared to < 5 fibres/L for surface and sub-surface bulk water samples. Data collected show the usefulness of the dipped glass plate method as a rapid and inexpensive tool for sampling SML-associated microplastics in estuaries , and indicate that microplastics preferentially accumulate at the SML in estuarine conditions ( providing a potential transfer mechanism for incorporation into upper intertidal sinks). Fibres are present ( and readily sampled) in both developed and more pristine estuarine systems.
