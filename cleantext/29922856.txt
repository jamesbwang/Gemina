  Newcastle<pathogen> disease<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( NDV) , the type member of the species Avian avulavirus 1 ( formerly known as avian paramyxovirus<pathogen> serotype 1) , causes a highly contagious and economically important disease in a myriad of avian species around the globe. While extensive vaccination programs have been implemented in ND-endemic countries , the disease is continuously spreading in commercial , backyard , and wild captive poultry. In order to investigate the evolution of the virus and assess the efficiency of the vaccine regimens that are currently being applied in commercial poultry , four wild-bird-origin NDV strains were characterized biologically , based on mean death time and intracerebral pathogenicity index , and genetically , based on the cleavage motif (
