  We synthesized a silver nanoparticle/zinc oxide ( Ag NP/ZnO) thin film by using spin-coating technology. The treatment solution for Ag NP/ZnO thin film deposition contained zinc acetate ( Zn ( CH ₃ COO) ₂) , sodium hydroxide ( NaOH) , and silver nitrate ( AgNO ₃) aqueous solutions. The crystalline characteristics , surface morphology , content of elements , and reflectivity of the Ag NPs/ZnO thin film at various concentrations of the AgNO ₃ aqueous solution were investigated using X-ray diffraction , scanning electron microscopy , energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy , atomic force microscopy , and ultraviolet ⁻ visible ⁻ near infrared spectrophotometry. The results indicated that the crystalline structure , Ag content , and reflectance of Ag NP/ZnO thin films depended on the AgNO ₃ concentration. Hybrid antireflection coatings ( ARCs) composed of SiN
