  This articles outlines the important issue of chronic oedema , its definition and the physiology of the three main categories. The care delivered in the care home ( nursing) sector was the subject of a printed questionnaire and the results are presented here. They are discussed and the implications for practice and an evidenced-based approach to care delivery are considered. Several conclusions can be drawn from this study but would be strengthened by a larger study. Care for patients with chronic oedema could be enhanced and this would improve clinical outcomes; significantly fewer patients would need to be referred for GP management if an appropriate and timely first-line treatment was agreed and provided by nursing staff. An educational resource should be developed , including: a resource folder; e-learning , patient information , and a patient leg exercise regime; a crib sheet and myth buster information; and clinical competencies. A further study would be required to confirm whether fewer patients experienced falls or presented with chronic oedema when lower leg<symptom> swelling was managed.
