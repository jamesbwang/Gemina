  Butanol fermentation comprises two successive and distinct stages , namely acidogenesis and solventogenesis. The current lack of clarity regarding the underlying metabolic regulation of fermentation impedes improvements in biobutanol production. Here , a proteomics study was performed in the acidogenesis phase , the lowest pH point ( transition point) , and the solventogenesis phase in the butanol-producing symbiotic system TSH06. Forty-two Clostridium<pathogen> acetobutylicum proteins demonstrated differential expression levels at different stages. The protein level of butanol dehydrogenase increased in the solventogenesis phase , which was in accordance with the trend of butanol concentration. Stress proteins were upregulated either at the transition point or in the solventogenesis phase. The cell division-related protein Maf was upregulated at the transition point. We disrupted the maf gene in C. acetobutylicum TSH1 , and Bacillus<pathogen> cereus<pathogen> TSH2 was added to form a new symbiotic system. TSH06 △ maf produced 13.9 ± 1.0 g/L butanol , which was higher than that of TSH06 ( 12.3 ± 0.9 g/L). Butanol was furtherly improved in fermentation at variable temperature with neutral red addition for both TSH06 and TSH06 △ maf. The butanol titer of the maf deletion strain was higher than that of the wild type , although the exact mechanism remains to be determined.
