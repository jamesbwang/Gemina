  The authors sought to investigate the association between P2Y The association between platelet reactivity on clopidogrel and the risk for ischemic cerebrovascular events remains unclear. Incidence , predictors , and prognostic impact of IS were evaluated among patients enrolled in the multicenter , prospective ADAPT-DES ( Assessment of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy With Drug Eluting Stents) study. By protocol , patients were maintained on aspirin for 2 years and clopidogrel for at least 1 year. Baseline platelet reactivity on clopidogrel and aspirin were assessed by means of VerifyNow point-of-care assay after successful DES implantation. Among 8,582 patients enrolled , 68 ( 0.8 %) had an IS during 2-year follow-up. Across the spectrum of PRU , rates of IS were progressively greater as patients transitioned from the lowest quintile of PRU ( more P2Y Higher PRU was associated with increased risk of IS after coronary DES implantation.
