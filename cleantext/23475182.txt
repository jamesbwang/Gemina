  Th17 cells are generally considered to be positive regulators of immune responses because they produce pro-inflammatory cytokines , including IL-17A , IL-17F , and IL-22. Cytokine production not only promotes accumulation of immune cells , such as macrophages , neutrophils and lymphocytes , at inflammatory sites but can also cause tissue pathologies. Conversely , certain Th17 cells can also negatively regulate immune responses by secreting immunosuppressive factors , such as IL-10; these cells are termed non-pathogenic Th17 cells. In this review , we summarize recent advances in the development and regulatory functions of non-pathogenic Th17 cells in autoimmune diseases.
