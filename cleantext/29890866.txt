  To investigate maternal serum levels of betatrophin and their relationship with total bile acid ( TBA) levels in patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy ( ICP). Fifty-nine pregnant women with ICP ( 31 patients with severe and 28 patients with mild disease classifications) and 23 healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies as the control group included the study. The maternal betatrophin , fasting blood glucose , fasting insulin ( FI) , and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR) levels of the groups were compared. Serum betatrophin levels were significantly higher in the ICP groups than in the control group ( p = .04 and p < .001 , respectively). The FI levels and HOMA-IR values were significantly higher in the severe ICP group than in the control group ( p = .006 and p = .001 , respectively). While a significant positive correlation was found between betatrophin levels and fasting and postprandial TBA levels , there was no significant correlation among betatrophin and HOMA-IR or FI levels. Betatrophin levels were shown to correlate with TBA levels , it provides a model for future studies to understand the physiopathology of ICP , a complex metabolic disease. Changes in betatrophin levels may shed light on the pathogenesis of ICP.
