  Rab2 is a conserved Rab GTPase with a well-established role in secretory pathway function and phagocytosis. Here we demonstrate that Drosophila Rab2 is recruited to late endosomal membranes<symptom> , where it controls the fusion of LAMP-containing biosynthetic carriers and lysosomes to late endosomes. In contrast , the lysosomal GTPase Gie/Arl8 is only required for late endosome-lysosome fusion , but not for the delivery of LAMP to the endocytic pathway. We also find that Rab2 is required for the fusion of autophagosomes to the endolysosomal pathway , but not for the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles. Surprisingly , Rab2 does not rely on HOPS-mediated vesicular fusion for recruitment to late endosomal membranes<symptom>. Our work suggests that Drosophila Rab2 is a central regulator of the endolysosomal and macroautophagic/autophagic pathways by controlling the major heterotypic fusion processes at the late endosome.
