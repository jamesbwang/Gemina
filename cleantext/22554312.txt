  Osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI) is a hereditary connective tissue disorder of skeletal fragility and more recently muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom>. This review highlights our current knowledge of the impact of compromised OI muscle function on muscle-bone interactions and skeletal strength in OI. The ramifications of inherent muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> in OI muscle-bone interactions are just beginning to be elucidated. Studies in patients and in OI mouse models implicate altered mechanosensing , energy metabolism , mitochondrial dysfunction , and paracrine/endocrine crosstalk in the pathogenesis of OI. Compromised muscle-bone unit impacts mechanosensing and the ability of OI muscle and bone to respond to physiotherapeutic and pharmacologic treatment strategies. Muscle and bone are both compromised in OI , making it essential to understand the mechanisms responsible for both impaired muscle and bone functions and their interdependence , as this will expand and drive new physiotherapeutic and pharmacological approaches to treat OI and other musculoskeletal disorders.
