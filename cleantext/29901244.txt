  Frustrated Lewis pairs ( FLP) , a couple comprising a sterically encumbered Lewis acid and Lewis base , can offer latent reactivity for activating inert gas molecules. However , their use as a platform for fabricating gas-responsive materials has not yet developed. Merging the FLP concept with polymers , we report a new generation CO
