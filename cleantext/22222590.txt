  Data on the physical and performance characteristics of female wheelchair basketball ( WB) players are scarce. In several countries female WB players train and compete with male players on mixed teams due to the limited total population of players , which would otherwise lead to large territorial spread for each team. Any differences in terms of physical characteristics and/or WB skill proficiency between male and female WB players would be relevant to team performance in mixed teams. This work examined anthropometry , body composition , and performance in a set of sport-specific field tests in a sample of 13 female WB players representing about 40 % of the eligible population in Italy across a range of functional point scores ( Point). Point is assigned on an ordinal scale from 1.0 ( i.e. , players with minimal functional potential) through to 4.5 ( players with maximum functional potential). Our female sample was then compared against twice as many (
