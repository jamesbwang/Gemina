  Macroautophagy/autophagy is an important catabolic process mediating cellular homeostasis and plays critical roles in cancer development. Whereas autophagy has been widely studied in various pathological models , little is known about the distribution , clinical significance and regulatory mechanism of this process in human hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC). In the present study , we found that tumor tissues exhibited significantly increased levels of autophagy compared with non-tumor tissues , and cancer cells with higher levels of autophagy were predominantly enriched in the invading edge regions of human HCC. Increased MAP1LC3B/LC3B expression in the invading edge regions was significantly correlated with a higher density of closely located monocytes , and TNF and IL1B derived from tumor-activated monocytes synergistically induced cancer cell autophagy in the invading edge regions of HCC. Monocyte-elicited autophagy induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) of cancer cells and promoted tumor metastasis by activating the NFKB-SNAI1 signaling pathway. Moreover , the increase of LC3B
