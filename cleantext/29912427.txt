  Tenofovir is a potent inhibitor of human telomerase. The clinical relevance of this inhibition is unknown. Prospective cohort of HIV-1 infected participants with suppressed virological replication , comparing whole blood telomere length ( measured by quantitative multiplex PCR) of participants with current exposure versus never exposed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. 172 participants included: 67 in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF)- group and 105 in the non-TDF group ( 75 receiving two nucleosides ( 69 abacavir) , 25 receiving a completely nucleos ( t) ide sparing regimen , and 5 receiving lamivudine as the only nucleoside). After two years mean blood telomere length increased significantly in both groups. The TDF group had significantly smaller gains in telomere length than the non-TDF group. In the analysis restricted to participants receiving nucleos ( t) ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors , TDF exposure was not associated with an independent negative effect. In the non-TDF group participants treated with two nucleosides had also significantly smaller gains in telomere length than those receiving completely nucleos ( t) ide reverse transcriptase sparing regimens or lamivudine as the only nucleoside. in HIV-infected adults with prolonged virological suppression treatment with TDF or abacavir was associated with smaller gains in blood telomere length after two years of follow-up.
