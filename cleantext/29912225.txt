  The assessment of myocardial viability is a crucial step in the work-up of patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular ( LV) systolic dysfunction. Myocardial revascularization should be considered in patients with viable myocardium and LV systolic dysfunction , since this could improve LV function and outcomes.Noninvasive imaging plays a key role in the study of viability and different modalities are currently available , including cardiac magnetic resonance , stress echocardiography and nuclear imaging. The definition of myocardial viability is different , depending on the imaging technique used and it is important for cardiologists to know the information that each modality can offer in this setting.
