  The purpose of this study was to determine the anastomotic leak rate for colorectal cancer resections in patients with metastases ( compared to those without) , and to determine the impact of anastomotic leaks on survival. This is a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent resection and primary anastomosis for colorectal adenocarcinoma at a single institution between January 2002 and December 2014. A total of 843 patients underwent a resection and primary anastomosis for colorectal adenocarcinoma ( 661 colon and 182 rectal). Of these , 135 ( 16 %) had metastases and 708 ( 84 %) did not. Anastomotic leaks occurred in 17 of 135 ( 13 %) patients with metastases , and in 37 of 798 ( 5.2 %) patients without metastases ( P = 0.003). Peri-operative mortality occurred in 13 of 135 ( 9.6 %) patients with metastases , compared with 19 of 708 ( 2.7 %) patients without metastases ( P = 0.0003). Anastomotic leak was associated with a reduction in overall survival ( median survival 121 months without anastomotic leak versus 66 months in patients who had an anastomotic leak ( P = 0.02)). If the patients who died peri-operatively are excluded from this analysis , however , long-term mortality was similar ( 125 months versus 101 months; P = 0.70). Metastatic disease was associated with an increased risk of anastomotic leak and a higher peri-operative mortality rate after colorectal resections for cancer. Patients with anastomotic leaks had a higher peri-operative mortality rate , but long-term survival was unaffected beyond the peri-operative phase.
