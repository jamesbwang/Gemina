  In streptococci of the mitis<pathogen> group , competence for natural transformation is a transient physiological state triggered by competence stimulating peptides ( CSPs). Although low transformation yields and the absence of a widespread functional competence system have been reported for Streptococcus<pathogen> mitis<pathogen> , recent studies revealed that , at least for some strains , high efficiencies can be achieved following optimization protocols. To gain a deeper insight into competence in this species , we used RNA-seq , to map the global CSP response of two transformable strains: the type strain NCTC12261 All known genes induced by ComE in Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , including sigX , were upregulated in the two strains. Likewise , all sets of streptococcal SigX core genes involved in extracellular DNA uptake , recombination , and fratricide were upregulated. No significant differences in the set of induced genes were observed when the type strain was grown in rich or semi-defined media. Five upregulated operons unique to S.<pathogen> mitis<pathogen> with a SigX-box in the promoter region were identified , including two specific to SK321 , and one specific to NCTC12261 Overall , comparison of the global transcriptome in response to CSP shows the conservation of the ComE and SigX-core regulons in competent S.<pathogen> mitis<pathogen> isolates , as well as species and strain-specific genes. Although some S.<pathogen> mitis<pathogen> exhibit truncations in key competence genes , this study shows that in transformable strains , competence seems to depend on the same core genes previously identified in
