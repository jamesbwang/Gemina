  Men with nonmetastatic , castration-resistant prostate cancer and a rapidly rising prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) level are at high risk for metastasis. We hypothesized that enzalutamide , which prolongs overall survival among patients with metastatic , castration-resistant prostate cancer , would delay metastasis in men with nonmetastatic , castration-resistant prostate cancer and a rapidly rising PSA level. In this double-blind , phase 3 trial , we randomly assigned , in a 2:1 ratio , men with nonmetastatic , castration-resistant prostate cancer and a PSA doubling time of 10 months or less who were continuing androgen-deprivation therapy to receive enzalutamide ( at a dose of 160 mg) or placebo once daily. The primary end point was metastasis-free survival ( defined as the time from randomization to radiographic progression or as the time to death without radiographic progression). A total of 1401 patients ( median PSA doubling time , 3.7 months) underwent randomization. As of June 28 , 2017 , a total of 219 of 933 patients ( 23 %) in the enzalutamide group had metastasis or had died , as compared with 228 of 468 ( 49 %) in the placebo group. The median metastasis-free survival was 36.6 months in the enzalutamide group versus 14.7 months in the placebo group ( hazard ratio for metastasis or death , 0.29; 95 % confidence interval , 0.24 to 0.35; P < 0.001). The time to the first use of a subsequent antineoplastic therapy was longer with enzalutamide treatment than with placebo ( 39.6 vs. 17.7 months; hazard ratio , 0.21; P < 0.001; such therapy was used in 15 % vs. 48 % of patients) as was the time to PSA progression ( 37.2 vs. 3.9 months; hazard ratio , 0.07; P < 0.001; progression occurred in 22 % vs. 69 % of patients). At the first interim analysis of overall survival , 103 patients ( 11 %) receiving enzalutamide and 62 ( 13 %) receiving placebo had died. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 31 % of the patients receiving enzalutamide , as compared with 23 % of those receiving placebo. Among men with nonmetastatic , castration-resistant prostate cancer with a rapidly rising PSA level , enzalutamide treatment led to a clinically meaningful and significant 71 % lower risk of metastasis or death than placebo. Adverse events were consistent with the established safety profile of enzalutamide. ( Funded by Pfizer and Astellas Pharma; PROSPER ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT02003924.).
