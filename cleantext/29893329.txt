  Increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs) in breast carcinoma tissues is an independent predictive factor for pathologic complete response ( pCR). The increased intratumoral and stromal TILs ( sTILs) in breast cancer ( BC) have significant prognostic effects. In this study , we evaluated whether pCR rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT) are higher in tumors with increased number of TILs in the pretreatment biopsy. We retrospectively evaluated the number of TILs in intratumoral TILs ( iTILs) and sTILs compartments from pretreatment full-face hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of 62 patients with locally advanced BC ( LABC) who received NACT. The capacity of sTILs and iTILs in predicting pCR to NACT in LABC analyzed using receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis. According to ROC curve analysis , the optimum sTILs and iTILs cut-off points ( the number of positive cells per square millimeter of tissue) for patients with LABC patients with pCR ( +) were 19 ( area under the curve ( AUC): 0.668 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) ( 0.501-0.835) , P = 0.064) and 4 ( AUC: 0.786 , 95 % CI ( 0.666-0.907) , P = 0.002) , respectively. Of the 62 patients , 26 had sTILs > 19 and 25 had iTILs > 4. The patients were divided into two according to percent of sTILs ( sTILs > 19 and sTILs ≤ 19 groups) and iTILs ( iTILs > 4 and iTILs ≤ 4 groups). Both sTILs > 19 and iTILs > 4 patients were associated with development higher pCR. While pCR was significantly higher in iTILs > 4 patients ( P = 0.002) , it was not significantly in sTILs > 19 patients ( P = 0.107). There is significantly an association between pCR and increased number of intratumoral TILs ( > 4 cells/mm
