  Recent studies have shown that the genome of Legionella<pathogen> pneumophila<pathogen> is characterized by many foreign genes from a variety of eukaryotes. The eukaryotic like proteins are known to play a role in its multiplication within host cells; however , their evolutionary genetics of L.<pathogen> pneumophila<pathogen> in environments is unknown. In this study , we examined the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate of eukaryotic like domain encoding genes among L.<pathogen> pneumophila<pathogen> strains. In silico analysis revealed that the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate in F-box domain gene ( lpp0233) was higher than those in other eukaryotic like domain and protein encoding genes and housekeeping genes. The F-box domain gene sequences in L.<pathogen> pneumophila<pathogen> strains isolated from a natural hot spring were more diversified than those of previously known strains , owing to preferential positive selection.
