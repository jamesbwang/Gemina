  Obtaining biopsies for pathological diagnosis of primary cardiac tumors is challenging due to their anatomical location and the risk of tumor embolization. Due to the difficulty of histological diagnosis and limited treatment strategies , it is not uncommon to treat patients based on radiological findings alone. However , firm pathological diagnosis may permit more appropriate treatment selection , especially for those with primary cardiac lymphoma. EUS-B-FNA is a minimally invasive modality for sampling mediastinal lymph nodes and mediastinal lesions<symptom> adjacent to the esophagus. We report two cases with cardiac tumors that were successfully and safely diagnosed by EUS-B-FNA.
