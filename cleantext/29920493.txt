  Depression<symptom> and obesity are widespread and closely linked. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) and vitamin D are both assumed to be associated with depression<symptom> and obesity. Little is known about the interplay between vitamin D and BDNF. We explored the putative associations and interactions between serum BDNF and vitamin D levels with depressive symptoms and abdominal obesity in a large population-based cohort. Data were obtained from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania ( SHIP)- Trend ( n = 3,926). The associations of serum BDNF and vitamin D levels with depressive symptoms ( measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire) were assessed with binary and multinomial logistic regression models. The associations of serum BDNF and vitamin D levels with obesity ( measured by the waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR)) were assessed with binary logistic and linear regression models with restricted cubic splines. Logistic regression models revealed inverse associations of vitamin D with depression<symptom> ( OR = 0.966; 95 % CI 0.951-0.981) and obesity ( OR = 0.976; 95 % CI 0.967-0.985). No linear association of serum BDNF with depression<symptom> or obesity was found. However , linear regression models revealed a U-shaped association of BDNF with WHR ( p < 0.001). Vitamin D was inversely associated with depression<symptom> and obesity. BDNF was associated with abdominal obesity , but not with depression<symptom> At the population level , our results support the relevant roles of vitamin D and BDNF in mental and physical health-related outcomes.
