  Currently , acute ischemic stroke is still a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Approximately 2 years ago , mechanical thrombectomy was proven beneficial as a revolutionary new therapy for stroke in the MR-CLEAN trial ( A Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands). However , the mechanisms by which the thrombectomy device , or stent-retriever , interacts with the thrombus are largely unknown. A better understanding could lead to improved efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy devices. Seven stent-retrievers with thrombi still entrapped were collected directly after thrombectomy. The stent-retrievers were studied using micro computed tomography , followed by scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. Two independent observers rated interaction type and thrombus surface structure ( porous filamentous or dense) at the interaction sites.A total of 79 interaction sites between thrombus and stent-retriever were categorized. Thrombus-stent-retriever interaction was found to be adhesive ( n = 44; 56 %) or mechanical ( n = 35; 44 %). Adhesive interaction was most frequently observed at interaction sites with a dense surface , compared with interaction sites with a porous filamentous fibrin surface ( 38/58; 66 % versus 6/21; 29 % , The interaction between thrombus and stent-retriever was predominantly adhesive , not mechanical. Adhesive interaction was strongly associated with the presence of a dense thrombus surface without a porous filamentous fibrin network.
