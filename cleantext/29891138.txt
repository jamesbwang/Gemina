  Hepatitis<pathogen> E<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HEV<pathogen>) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen mainly transmitted via food in developed countries , and for which domestic pigs are recognised as the main reservoir. To implement an efficient HEV<pathogen> surveillance and control plan in the pig production sector , it is first necessary to assess the level of knowledge of pig-farming main actors about this pathogen. To this aim , an online survey was conducted between September and October 2017 to evaluate pig farmers ' and veterinarians ' knowledge about HEV<pathogen> epidemiology and its zoonotic potential. The questionnaire was filled in by 383 pig farmers and 46 pig veterinarians. Of this population , 77.8 % of farmers and 8.7 % of veterinarians had never heard of HEV<pathogen>. Our results highlight knowledge gaps among responding farmers , especially regarding the clinical and epidemiological features of HEV<pathogen> , while veterinarians appear to be well-informed about this pathogen. These findings indicate significant room for further improvement and the need for more information aimed at French pig farmers , with veterinarians acting as a priority channel through which information may be transferred from scientists to farmers. These educational efforts will facilitate farmers ' involvement in future HEV<pathogen> surveillance and control plans.
