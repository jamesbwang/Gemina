  Spinocerebellar ataxia<symptom> type 8 ( SCA8) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by expanded CTA/CTG repeats in the ATXN8OS gene. Many patients had pure cerebellar ataxia<symptom> , while some had parkinsonism , both without causal explanation. We analyzed the ATXN8OS gene in 150 Japanese patients with ataxia<symptom> and 76 patients with Parkinson 's disease or related disorders. We systematically reassessed 123 patients with SCA8 , both our patients and those reported in other studies. Two patients with progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP) had mutations in the ATXN8OS gene. Systematic analyses revealed that patients with parkinsonism had significantly shorter CTA/CTG repeat expansions and older age at onset than those with predominant ataxia<symptom> We show the imaging results of patients with and without parkinsonism. We also found a significant inverse relationship between repeat sizes and age at onset in all patients , which has not been detected previously. Our results may be useful to genetic counseling , improve understanding of the pathomechanism , and extend the clinical phenotype of SCA8.
