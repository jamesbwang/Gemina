  The regulatory roles of lncRNAs in the development of alcoholic hepatic fibrosis<disease> ( AHF) have not been revealed. Here , we found lncRNA Gm5091 was being downregulated in mouse hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs) during AHF. Then , Gm5091 was respectively overexpressed and knocked down in alcohol-treated primary HSCs. Our results showed that Gm5091 negatively regulated cell migration , ROS content , IL-1β secretion , and expression of Collagen I and markers of HSC activation including α-SMA and Desmin. Furthermore , bioinformatics analysis showed that Gm5091 sequence contained binding sites of miR-27b , miR-23b and miR-24 , and we proved that miR-27b/ 23b/24 all bound to Gm5091 by using RNA pull-down assay. Full-length Gm5091 could decrease the miR-27b/ 23b/24 levels , but the truncated Gm5091 deleting the binding sites could not. Finally , we confirmed that full-length Gm5091 could alleviate alcoholic hepatic fibrosis<disease> in vivo , but the truncated Gm5091 could not. In conclusion , lncRNA Gm5091 alleviates mouse alcoholic hepatic fibrosis<disease> by sponging miR-27b/ 23b/24.
