  To characterize how increasing computed tomography ( CT)- quantified glenoid bone loss influences measured version. Six embalmed cadaveric shoulders were used for this study. Glenoid bone defects were computer modeled in cadaveric shoulders; CT images were obtained and segmented using OsiriX software , creating 3-dimensional en face glenoids. Glenoid defects were made on CT images of intact glenoids superimposed with a glenoid clock face viewed en face to simulate anterior and posterior bone loss. Bony defects in various positions comprising 3 % , 9.5 % , and 19.5 % were created posteriorly. Best-fit circles were superimposed to represent 10 % and 25 % defects anteriorly. Version was measured using the Friedman method. The average glenoid version measured 4 ° of retroversion , 2 ° after 10 % anterior bone loss , and neutral version in the 25 % bone loss group. Version was significantly altered when we compared intact glenoids versus 10 % and 25 % anterior glenoid bone loss ( P < .001). Increasing from 10 % to 25 % bone loss showed a significant difference in measured version ( P = .025). Posterior defects from the 6:30 to 8:30 clock-face position averaged 4.6 ° of retroversion; from the 6:30 to 9:30 clock-face position , 6.2 ° of retroversion; and from the 6:30 to 10:30 clock-face position , 8.7 ° of retroversion. When comparing glenoid defects at the 6:30 to 8:30 clock-face position with those involving the 6:30 to 9:30 and 6:30 to 10:30 clock-face positions ( P < .001) , a 1 ° correction may be used for every 5 % of bone loss to account for version changes seen with bone loss. In this cadaveric analysis , glenoid version was altered in the setting of increasing posterior and anterior bone loss. A correction factor may be considered to account for this. When comparing glenoid defects at the 6:30 to 8:30 clock-face position with those involving the 6:30 to 9:30 and 6:30 to 10:30 clock-face positions ( P < .001) , a 1 ° correction may be used for every 5 % of bone loss to account for version changes seen with bone loss. This cadaveric study shows that glenoid bone loss alters glenoid version , as measured by CT , in a meaningful way. This information is important in managing anterior and posterior shoulder instability , and correction of measured version should be considered in this setting to provide an accurate and comprehensive evaluation.
