  Despite rich source of protein & oil , wild ( bitter) apricot ( Prunus armeniaca L.) kernel is rarely exploited by food industries due to high amount of antinutrients and potentially toxic amygdalin. The present study was aimed to assess the effect of detoxification on the biological quality of the wild apricot kernel ( WAK) supplemented diet. In order to detoxify , wild apricot kernel flour was soaked in 25 % sodium chloride solution for approximately 24h followed by washing and drying. Results revealed that detoxification significantly ( p < 0.05) improved the nutritional quality by reducing antinutrients ( tannins , flavonoids , trypsin inhibitor , saponins , oxalates , phytates and hydrocyanic acid) from raw WAK. When compared to raw kernel group , detoxified WAK group exhibited significantly ( p < 0.05) higher values for growth performance parameters viz. feed consumed ( 169.14 ± 3.40 vs. 152.14 ± 1.59 g) , protein consumed ( 16.91 ± 0.63 vs. 15.21 ± 0.68 g) , weight gain ( 64.77 ± 2.59 vs. 48.74 ± 0.62 g) , protein efficiency ratio ( 3.83 ± 0.33 vs. 3.20 ± 0.36) , feed efficiency ratio ( 0.38 ± 0.017 vs. 0.32 ± 0.02) , biological value ( 73.62 ± 4.53 vs. 65.26 ± 4.60 %) , apparent protein digestibility ( 78.55 ± 1.37 vs. 70.35 ± 2.66 %) , true protein digestibility and net protein utilization suggesting a prominent effect of detoxification in order to improve the biological quality of the WAK. Detoxification improved the biological quality of the WAK supplemented diet. Hence , detoxified kernel flour could be utilized as an economic & quality source of protein and oil for the supplementation of value-added food products. This article is protected by copyright.
