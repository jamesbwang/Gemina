  Asthma is the most common chronic illness of childhood and a common reason for hospital admission. Studies suggest that low vitamin D levels may be associated with health service utilization ( HSU) for childhood asthma. The primary objective was to determine if vitamin D serum levels in early childhood were associated with HSU for asthma including: a) hospital admissions; b) emergency department visits; and c) outpatient sick visits. Secondary objectives were to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy or childhood were associated with HSU for asthma. Prospective cohort study of children participating in the TARGet Kids! practice-based research network between 2008 and 2013 in Toronto , Canada. HSU was determined by linking each child 's provincial health insurance number to health administrative databases. Multivariable quasi-Poisson and logistic regression were used to evaluate the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations , vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy , and childhood and HSU for asthma. A total of 2926 healthy children aged 0-6 years had 25-hydroxyvitamin D data available and were included in the primary analysis. Mean ( IQR) 25-hydroxyvitmain D level was 84 nmol/L ( 65-98 nmol/L) , 218 and 1267 children had 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations < 50 nmol/L and < 75 nmol/L , respectively. In the adjusted models , there were no associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations ( continuously or dichotomized at 50 and 75 nmol/L) , vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy or childhood and HSU for asthma. Vitamin D blood values do not appear to be associated with HSU for asthma in this population of healthy urban children.
