  Recently , toxic α-synuclein oligomer , which can mediate cell-to-cell propagation is suggested to cause sporadic Parkinson disease. α-Synuclein interacts with membrane lipids especially polyunsaturated fatty acids to stabilize its three-dementional structure. Peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids may reduce their affinity to α-synuclein and peroxidation byproducts might modify α-synuclein. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal derived from
