  Oral leukoplakia is the most common potentially malignant disorder ( PMD) of the oral cavity. The objectives of this study are to determine the clinicopathologic features in a group of patients with oral leukoplakia of Northern Spain ( Galicia) , determining the factors associated to clinical risk and analyzing the malignant transformation of these patients. We included 85 patients. We recorded sex and age , habits like alcohol and tobacco , size , clinical appearance , site , number of lesions<symptom> , and presence or absence of dysplasia. We assess the association between risk factors and transformation and developed a logistic regression analysis. Finally we used the Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test for the survival analysis. 7 patients ( 8.2 %) had malignant transformation. The mean follow-up of the patients was 4.13 years versus 5.58 years of those who developed carcinoma. Only location and initial dysplasia have a statistically significant relationship with malignant transformation , but when applied the long rank test only the presence of dysplasia remains statistically significant ( P < 0,026). Oral Cancer Free Survival was 81.9 % ( 0.150) at 11 years for the group without dysplasia. We found that the presence of dysplasia is the only risk factor that is statistically related to the development of a carcinoma.
