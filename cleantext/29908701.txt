  The present method was optimized and validated to enable quantification of more than twenty compounds from four chemical classes of important lipid substances , including vitamin E and A derivatives , sterols and chlorophylls. After lipid dissolution in the mobile phase , chromatographic separation is accomplished with the newest generation of ultrapure unbounded fully porous silica particles and , finally , target analytes are quantified by diode-array tandem fluorescence detection. A broad working range was achieved for most compounds ( r
