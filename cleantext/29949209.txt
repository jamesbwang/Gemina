  Zeolite-type chalcogenides are desirable due to their integration between porosity and semiconductivity. CPM-120 , with super-sodalite topology ( Zeolite Structure Code: RWY) , is among the few zeolite-type chalcogenides with permanent porosity , and is the only chalcogenide with a zeolite code. Importantly , the RWY-type has evolved into a platform for studying properties of porous chalcogenides. Yet so far , few studies have been made to probe the effects of synthetic parameters and framework compositions on this platform. Here , we probe the effects of the third metal type ( Ga
