  Monoclonal antibodies against soluble targets are often rich and include the sampling of multiple analytes over a lengthy period of time. Predictive models built on data obtained in such studies can be useful in all drug development phases. If adequate model predictions can be maintained with a reduced design ( e.g. fewer samples or shorter duration) the use of such designs may be advocated. The effect of reducing and optimizing a rich design based on a published study for Omalizumab ( OMA) was evaluated as an example. OMA pharmacokinetics were characterized using a target-mediated drug disposition model considering the binding of OMA to free IgE and the subsequent formation of an OMA-IgE complex. The performance of the reduced and optimized designs was evaluated with respect to: efficiency , parameter uncertainty and predictions of free target. It was possible to reduce the number of samples in the study by 30 % while still maintaining an efficiency of almost 90 %. A reduction in sampling duration by two-thirds resulted in an efficiency of 75 %. Omission of any analyte measurement or a reduction of the number of dose levels was detrimental to the efficiency of the designs ( efficiency â‰¤ 51 %). However , other metrics were , in some cases , relatively unaffected , showing that multiple metrics may be needed to obtain balanced assessments of design performance.
