  Magnetic levitation is a recent research hot spot; however , most of the extant configurations use two magnets with like poles facing each other. This paper proposes a novel magnetic levitation configuration that is based on a single ring magnet , and this configuration opens a wide operational space that enables object manipulation and density-based measurement. We develop a mathematical model to calculate the magnetic field around the magnet and to numerically correlate the levitation height and density of the object. Experimental results prove that this novel configuration can achieve a high accuracy ( ± 0.0005 to ± 0.0078 g/cm
