  Skin physiology measurement is receiving more attention for detecting vasculopathy in systemic sclerosis ( SSc). Laser Doppler flowmetry ( LDF) is a widely used physiological measurement to assess cutaneous microcirculation. However , findings of LDF may be normal during early stage of microangiopathy in SSc. We hypothesized that cold stress test combined with LDF could detect early-stage microangiopathy in patients with SSc. A 67-year-old male came with multiple ulcerations on his fingers for one year. After excluding diseases such as diabetes mellitus-related peripheral arterial occlusive disease and smoking-related Buerger 's disease , the diagnosis of SSc was made according to the 2013 ACR/EULAR criteria. We performed LDF and angiography for a patient with SSc and compared the results. Although occlusions of right ulnar and digital arteries were obvious in angiography , the baseline skin temperature and perfusion unit on right fingers remained within normal limits. While the microcirculatory abnormalities measured by LDF alone are subtle , LDF combined with cold stress test detected a significant slow recovery of skin blood flow 40 minutes after cold immersion. In conclusion , there may be discordance between macrovasculopathy and baseline microcirculatory blood flow in SSc. In such a case , cold immersion test is essential to measure the dynamic change and slow recovery of blood flow.
