  Exosomes participate in cancer progression and metastasis by transferring bioactive molecules between cancer and various cells in the local and distant microenvironments. Such intercellular cross-talk results in changes in multiple cellular and biological functions in recipient cells. Several hallmarks of cancer have reportedly been impacted by this exosome-mediated cell-to-cell communication , including modulating immune responses , reprogramming stromal cells , remodeling the architecture of the extracellular matrix , or even endowing cancer cells with characteristics of drug resistance. Selectively , loading specific oncogenic molecules into exosomes highlights exosomes as potential diagnostic biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets. In addition , exosome-based drug delivery strategies in preclinical and clinical trials have been shown to dramatically decrease cancer development. In the present review , we summarize the significant aspects of exosomes in cancer development that can provide novel strategies for potential clinical applications.
