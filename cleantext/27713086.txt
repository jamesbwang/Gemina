  With the development of biomaterials , more attention is paid to the adhesion characteristics between cells and materials. It is necessary to study the adhesive force with a suitable method. Silk fibroin ( SF) is widely investigated in biomedical application due to its novel biocompatibility and mechanical properties. In this article , the micropipette aspiration method and measurement pattern of uniform cells in round shape ( UCR) was used to study the initial adhesive force of three types of cells on pure silk fibroin films ( SFFs). We also compared the adhesive forces of modified SFFs with that of pure SFFs. The results of adhesive force in the initial adhesive stage were in concordance with the results of MTT assay and microscope observation , which were confirmed by the above three cell lines and four kinds of SFFs. The results indicated UCR was an efficient and quantitative measurement pattern in initial adhesion stage. This article also provides a useful method in identifying initial cell-materials interactions.
