  In this work , we investigate the local density of states ( LDOS) near a magnetic impurity in single-layer FeSe superconductors. The two-orbital model with spin-orbit coupling proposed in Agterberg et al ( 2017 Phys. Rev. Lett. 119Â 267001) is used to describe the FeSe superconductor. In the strong coupling regime , two impurity resonance peaks appear with opposite resonance energies in the LDOS spectral function. For strong spin-orbit coupling , the superconducting gap in this model is d-wave symmetric with nodes , the spatial distributions of the LDOS at the two resonance energies are fourfold symmetric , which reveals typical characteristic of d-wave pairing. When the spin-orbit coupling is not strong enough to close the superconducting gap , we find that the spatial distribution of the LDOS at one of the resonance energies manifests s-wave symmetry , while the pairing potential preserves d-wave symmetry. This result is consistent with previous experimental investigations.
