  Compassionate care is essential for better clinical and patient outcomes , but during healthcare provision it can be compromised by several factors. This study evaluates factors affecting compassion satisfaction , compassion fatigue<symptom> and burnout in nursing. Literature search in electronic databases was followed by data extraction , conversion , and meta-analyses under random effect model. Correlation coefficients ( r) reported by individual studies were first converted to z-scores for meta-analyses and the overall effect sizes were then back-transformed into r. Eleven studies ( 4054 respondents; 64.34 ( 95 % confidence interval: 38.82 , 89.86) % response rate; age 39.81 ( 31.36 , 48.27) years; 87.11 ( 79.48 , 94.73) % females) were used for meta-analysis. There was a strong positive correlation between compassion fatigue<symptom> and burnout ( r = 0.59) , whereas compassion satisfaction had weak negative correlation with compassion fatigue<symptom> ( r = -0.226) but moderate with burnout ( r = -0.446). Stress and negative affect were moderately positively associated with compassion fatigue<symptom> ( r = 0.405) but weakly correlated with burnout ( r = 0.119). Positive affect and personal/social factors had weak inverse relationship with burnout ( r = -0.197). Positive affect also had a moderately positive relationship with compassion satisfaction ( r = 0.396). Demographic or professional factors were not significantly related to compassion satisfaction , compassion fatigue<symptom> , or burnout. In nursing , a variety of stressful factors and negative affect promote compassion fatigue<symptom> and burnout whereas positive affect is helpful in achieving compassion satisfaction.
