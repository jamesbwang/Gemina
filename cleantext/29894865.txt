  Osteoporosis is a prevalent and debilitating condition affecting > 50 % of post-menopausal women. Yet , a low percentage of women regularly engage in health promoting behaviors associated with osteoporosis prevention. Complex , multidimensional , m-Health interventions hold promise to effect engagement in health behavior change related to calcium and vitamin D intake , balance<symptom> , core and leg strength , and physical activity. Striving to be Strong study ( R01NR013913-01) tests the efficacy of a research and theory based , patient centered , dynamically tailored intervention delivered via smart phone apps. Ecological Momentary Assessments ( EMAs) enhance immediate feedback and complement traditional measures. The desired outcomes are the maintenance of osteoporosis self-management behaviors and a decrease in the loss of bone density over time. The Individual and Family Self-management Theory provided the conceptual foundation for the study. The sample consists of 290 healthy women between the ages of 40 and 60 with an anticipated attrition of 33 %. This three group repeated measures Randomized Clinical Trial spans a 12-month time period. Data collected occurs via web site , smart-phone app , self-report , observation , and measures. Proximal ( engagement in osteoporosis health behaviors) and distal ( serum vitamin D , DXA , and body composition) outcomes are collected for testing of the efficacy of the intervention and theory evaluation. Active and rigorous quality management processes continually evaluate enrollment and retention goals , functionality of the automated intervention delivery and data collection systems , EMAs , and dispersion of incentives.
