  In Crohn 's disease ( CD) a small bowel study-in addition to colonoscopy-is considered necessary for diagnosis/staging. In this study we re-examined the role of capsule endoscopy ( CE) , colonoscopy , imaging tests ( magnetic resonance enterography/computed tomographic enterography ( MRE/CTE)) , and inflammatory markers ( fecal lactoferrin and C-reactive protein ( FL/CRP)) in CD patients who had undergone intestinal resection and in those who never had surgery. In this retrospective study 43 consecutive patients underwent CE because of staging/symptoms unexplained by colonoscopy/imaging. We compared colonoscopy , imaging , and FL/CRP with CE and evaluated the impact of the latter on clinical management and outcomes. In patients who never had surgery imaging was negative with a positive CE in 8/15 ( 53 %) of cases. Colonoscopy was insufficient for disease staging in 10/20 ( 50 %) cases. CRP and FL were normal with a positive CE in 35 % and 28 % of cases , respectively. CE findings changed the management in 6/20 ( 30 %) of cases , with 83 % showing clinical/biochemical improvement after up to 15 months of follow-up. In postoperative patients CE was positive with negative imaging in 6/8 ( 75 %) cases. Colonoscopy was insufficient for disease staging in 13/22 ( 59 %) cases. CRP and FL were normal in 42 % and 31.8 % of patients with positive CE. In these patients CE findings changed the management in 12/23 ( 52 %) cases with 83 % of them showing clinical/biochemical improvement after up to 18 months of follow-up. Omitting CE from diagnostic/staging algorithms in CD tends to underdiagnose clinically significant small bowel lesions<symptom> , thus impacting on patients ' management and outcomes. 10.1093/ ibd/izy048 _ video1izy048.video15794820403001.
