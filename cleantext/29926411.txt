  Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry ( MALDI-IMS) is a histological method used for various molecules including gangliosides. The method is based on mass spectrometry , and thus target molecules with small structural differences are directly and independently detected. Here we describe a general procedure and related key notes for analyzing major brain gangliosides by MALDI-IMS.
