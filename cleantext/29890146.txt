  Anomalous origin of the coronary artery from the aortic arch associated with hypoplastic left heart syndrome<disease> is an extremely rare anomaly. Coronary anomalies can significantly deteriorate the clinical outcomes of hypoplastic left heart syndrome<disease>. We describe the case of a newborn with concomitant hypoplastic left heart syndrome<disease> and abnormal origin of the left coronary artery arising from the distal aortic arch.
