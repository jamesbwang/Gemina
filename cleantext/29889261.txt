  This is the first report of presumed sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( sCJD) and Gerstmann-StrÃ¤ussler-Scheinker disease ( GSS) with the prion protein gene c. 305C > T mutation ( p.P102L) occurring in one family. The father and son were affected with GSS and the mother had a rapidly progressive form of CJD. Diagnosis of genetic , variant , and iatrogenic CJD was ruled out based on the mother 's clinical history , genetic tests , and biochemical investigations , all of which supported the diagnosis of sCJD. However , given the low incidence of sCJD and GSS , their co-occurrence in one family is extraordinary and challenging. Thus , a hypothesis for the transmission of infectious prion proteins ( PrPSc) via microchimerism was proposed and investigated. DNA from 15 different brain regions and plasma samples of the CJD patient was subjected to PCR and shallow sequencing for detection of a male sex-determining chromosome Y ( chr. Y). However , no trace of chr. Y was found. A long CJD incubation period or presumed small concentrations of chr. Y may explain the obtained results. Further studies of CJD and GSS animal models with controlled genetic and proteomic features are needed to determine whether maternal CJD triggered via microchimerism by a GSS fetus might present a new PrPSc transmission route.
