  When conservative treatments fail , hip osteoarthritis ( OA) , a chronic degenerative disease characterized by cartilage wear , progressive joint deformity , and loss of function , can result in the need for a total hip arthroplasty ( THA). Surgical procedures induced tissue trauma and incite an immune response. Photobiomodulation therapy ( PBMt) using low-level laser therapy ( LLLT) and/or light-emitting diode therapy ( LEDT) has proven effective in tissue repair by modulating the inflammatory process and promoting pain relief. Therefore , the aim of this study was to analyze the immediate effect of PBMt on inflammation<symptom> and pain of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The study consisted of 18 post-surgical hip arthroplasty patients divided into two groups ( n = 9 each) placebo and active PBMt who received one of the treatments in a period from 8 to 12 h following THA surgery. PBMt ( active or placebo) was applied using a device consisting of nine diodes ( one super-pulsed laser of 905 nm , four infrared LEDs of 875 nm , and four red LEDs 640 nm , 40.3 J per point) applied to 5 points along the incision. Visual analog scale ( VAS) and blood samples for analysis of the levels of the cytokines TNF-α , IL-6 , and IL-8 were recorded before and after PBMt application. The values for the visual analog scale as well as those in the analysis of TNF-α and IL-8 serum levels decreased in the active PBMt group compared to placebo-control group ( p < 0.05). No decrease was observed for IL-6 levels. We conclude that PBMt is effective in decreasing pain intensity and post-surgery inflammation<symptom> in patients receiving total hip arthroplasty.
