  Previous studies have shown that BC029135 , a long noncoding RNA ( lncRNA) with high conservation , was decreased with high fold change in colorectal cancer ( CRC) by using microarray assay. In the present work , we investigated the functions of BC029135 in CRC , as well as the potential mechanisms underlying the malignant phenotype caused by loss of BC029135. Bioinformatics analysis of lncRNA BC029135 was performed to identify the potential function. The cell lines of HCT-116 , SW480 , SW620 , LoVo , SW1116 , and HT29 were used in this study. The mRNA expression of BC029135 and β-actinin was measured by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT-PCR). Western blot analysis was used to determine protein expression of β-actinin , MMP-2 , cyclin D1 , and c-Myc. Our research showed that the expression of BC029135 in CRC tissues and cell lines was significantly lower than in adjacent normal tissues. In addition , overexpression of lncRNA BC029135 could inhibit the invasion of CRC cells. We also found that lncRNA BC029135 inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC cell lines. We suggest that up-regulation of BC029135 suppresses CRC invasion and inactivates Wnt/β-catenin signaling. It will provide new insights for the treatment of colorectal cancer and new clues for clinical treatment.
