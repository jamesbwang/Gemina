  Twelve new abietane diterpenoids ( 1-12) and 31 known analogues ( 13-43) were isolated from a medicinal Chinese herb , Clerodendrum trichotomum Thunberg. The absolute configurations of 1-3 were established on the basis of ECD and X-ray crystallography data , whereas that of 4 was elucidated by comparison of experimental and calculated ECD data. Eight diterpenoids , 15,16-dehydroteuvincenone G ( 1) , trichotomin A ( 4) , 2α-hydrocaryopincaolide F ( 7) , villosin C ( 20) , 15-dehydro-17-hydroxycyrtophyllone A ( 22) , demethylcryptojaponol ( 38) , 6β-hydroxydemethylcryptojaponol ( 39) , and trichotomone ( 43) , exerted inhibitory effects against NO production with IC
