  The purpose of this randomized , single-blind trial was to evaluate the efficacy of battlefield acupuncture in reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption after adult tonsillectomy. Adult<disease> participants undergoing a tonsillectomy were randomized to either receive auricular ` battlefield ' acupuncture or not. Groups were compared using the Wilcox rank sum test , Fisher 's exact test and a generalized estimating equations model for post-discharge pain scores. Statistically significant difference was not noted for morphine equivalent opioid use , nor was there any difference noted in the pain scores between the control group and treatment group. Acupuncture is cheap , safe and effective in many settings. Peri-operative battlefield auricular acupuncture did not reduce postoperative pain or opioid consumption in this study.
