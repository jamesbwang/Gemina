  TRIO and F-actin-binding protein ( TRIOBP) also referred to as Tara , was originally isolated as a cytoskeleton remodeling protein. TRIOBP-1 is important for regulating F-actin filament reorganization. TRIOBP variants are broadly classified as variant-1 or- 4 and do not share exons. TRIOBP variant-5 contains all exons. Earlier studies indicated that TRIOBP-4/ 5 mutation is a pivotal element of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. However , recent studies provide clues that TRIOBP variants are associated with other human<disease> diseases<disease> including cancer and brain diseases. In this review , recent functional studies focusing on TRIOBP variants and its possible disease models are described.
