  Insomnia is a common problem in older people , especially in patients with mild cognitive impairment ( MCI) whose circadian rhythm is often compromised. Insomnia exerts such a toll on caregivers that it is frequently the primary reason for seeking to institutionalize their loved ones. Three different types of insomnia are recognized: sleep-onset or initial insomnia , sleep maintenance or middle insomnia , and early morning awakening or late insomnia. Nocturnal hypoglycemia , as a cause of middle insomnia , is the main focus of this case study. Other types of insomnia are also briefly reviewed. The management of insomnia is then discussed including sleep hygiene , the usefulness and potential drawbacks of dietary supplements , nonprescription over-the-counter preparations and prescription hypnotics. Sleep architecture is then briefly reviewed , emphasizing the importance of its integrity and the role of each sleep stage.
