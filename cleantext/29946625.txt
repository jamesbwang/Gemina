  Allylic amines are converted to chiral , β-branched esters under rhodium catalysis in the presence of alcohol nucleophiles. Allylic amines with aliphatic and aromatic vinylic substituents are converted to ester products with excellent enantioselectivities in all cases. Several alcohol nucleophiles have been utilized in the reaction including 1 ° and 2 ° derivatives.
