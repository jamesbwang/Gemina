  To explore consumption situation and composition parameter distribution of indefinite-configuration foods in diets of some urban adult Chinese residents , and establish the parameters databases. A total of 1620 adult urban residents were sampled randomly by a multi-stage sampling method from four cities in Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces , and were investigated with a self-made Food Frequency Questionnaire. The moisture content status of indefinite-configuration foods from the market were analysed with the method of China national standards GB 5009. 3-2010 , then raw material composition of indefinite-configuration foods was calculated according to their moisture content. Kinds of food samples were simulated and took visual foods pictures in lab. Consumption rate of indefinite-configuration foods was higher in the last month. When eating outside , consumption rate of buns and soya-bean milk foods in whole diet were as high as 55. 6 % and 40. 4 %. When eating at home , consumptionratio of porridge and soup was more than 50 %. Daily intake of rice porridge , soya-bean milk reached as high as 30. 2 % and 22. 2 %. 100 g samples of the rice gruel contained rice 9. 2 g , 100 g soya-bean milk contained soybean 8. 2 g , 100 g pork buns contained wheat flour 42. 3 g and minced cooked meat 20. 7 g by laboratory analysis. Indefinite-configuration foods make up a large proportion of the whole diet , so it 's necessary to research the stationary raw material component parameters of the food and establish the parameters database for the dietary evaluator and nutrition instructor.
