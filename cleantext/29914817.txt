  Sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy ( SAPT) with low-glucose suspend ( LGS) is an effective and safe alternative for treating patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM). New predictive low-glucose management ( PLGM) systems decrease the severity and duration of hypoglycemic events. However , evidence of benefits in patients previously treated with SAPT-LGS is limited. A prospective before-after study was conducted in patients with T1DM treated with SAPT-LGS , who were switched to the Minimed Fifty-five patients with T1DM with a mean age of 37.9 ( IQR 6 , 79) years and a mean baseline A1c level of 7.52 ± 1.11 % were enrolled. After three months under PLGM , A1c levels significantly decreased to 7.18 ± 0.91 % ( p = 0.004). SH rate decreased from 2.47 ( CI 0.44 , 4.90) to 0.87 ( CI 0.22 , 1.52) events/patient-year ( Incidence rate ratio 0.353 , 95 % CI 0.178 , 0.637) , AUC < 70mg/dL decreased from 0.59 ± 0.76 to 0.35 ± 0.65 mg/dL x minute ( p = 0.030). HU determined by Clarke questionnaire resolved in 23 out of 30 patients ( p = 0.002). This study suggests that SAPT with PLGM decreases the frequency of SH , HU , exposure to glucose levels below 70mg/dL , and A1c levels. Based on these results , this therapy should be considered in T1DM patients previously treated with SAPT-LGS with persistent SH and HU. Further clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of these features are required.
