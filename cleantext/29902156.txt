  Background Hypertriglyceridemia thalassemia syndrome<disease> is a rare entity with an unknown pathogenetic link. Case presentation We report a case of an 8-month-old female with thalassemia major and increased triglyceride ( TG) levels. The clinical features were as in classical thalassemia except for a white discoloration of the plasma. After exclusion of familial triglyceridemia and secondary causes ( hypothyroidism , nephrotic syndrome<disease> , drugs etc.) , a diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia thalassemia syndrome<disease> was made. Conclusions The high levels of TG in these patients are associated with oxidative stress and higher risk of acute pancreatitis<disease> and coronary diseases. An early recognition is thus essential. In our patient , the levels reduced after a transfusion therapy similar to previous reports.
