  NMDA receptors ( NMDARs) are involved in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in different brain regions , and they modulate glutamate release at different presynaptic sites. Here , we studied whether non-postsynaptic NMDARs , putatively presynaptic ( preNMDARs) , are tonically active at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses , and if they modulate glutamate release. We found that when postsynaptic NMDARs are blocked by MK801 , D-AP5 depresses evoked and spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission , indicating that preNMDARs are tonically active at CA3-CA1 synapses , facilitating glutamate release. The subunit composition of these NMDARs was determined by studying evoked and spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission in the presence of Zn
