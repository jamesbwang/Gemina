  Chronic injury and inflammation<symptom> in the esophagus can cause a change in cellular differentiation known as metaplasia. Most commonly , the differentiation changes manifest as Barrett 's esophagus ( BE) , characterized by the normal stratified squamous epithelium converting into a cuboidal-columnar , glandular morphology. BE cells can phenotypically resemble specific normal cell types of the stomach or intestine , or they can have overlapping phenotypes in disorganized admixtures. The stomach can also undergo metaplasia characterized by aberrant gastric or intestinal differentiation patterns. In both organs , it has been argued that metaplasia may represent a recapitulation of the embryonic or juvenile gastrointestinal tract , as cells access a developmental progenitor genetic program that can help repair damaged tissue. Here , we review the normal development of esophagus and stomach , and describe how BE represents an intermixing of cells resembling gastric pseudopyloric ( SPEM) and intestinal metaplasia. We discuss a cellular process recently termed `` paligenosis '' that governs how mature , differentiated cells can revert to a proliferating progenitor state in metaplasia. We discuss the `` Cyclical Hit '' theory in which paligenosis might be involved in the increased risk of metaplasia for progression to cancer. However , somatic mutations might occur in proliferative phases and then be warehoused upon redifferentiation. Through years of chronic injury and many rounds of paligenosis and dedifferentiation , eventually a cell with a mutation that prevents dedifferentiation may arise and clonally expand fueling stable metaplasia and potentially thereafter acquiring additional mutations and progressing to dysplasia and cancer.
