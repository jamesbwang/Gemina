  Necrotizing vasculitic neuropathy in polyarteritis nodosa can rarely present acutely and may mimic acute inflammatory neuropathies. A 53-year-old male presented with an acute neurological illness characterized by paresthesia and weakness<symptom> of both lower limbs lasting six-days. He also had mild paresthesia of both hands. On examination , there were confluent , purpuric , and ecchymotic patches over the extensor aspects of both lower limbs , which were palpable. Neurological examination revealed grade II/V power with hypotonia and absent reflexes in the lower limbs. All modalities of sensation were decreased below the knee. Sensory impairment was also noted on the fingertips of both hands. Nerve conduction study suggested an asymmetrical sensorimotor axonal neuropathy. Sural nerve biopsy was consistent with necrotizing vasculitis. He was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone and monthly cyclophosphamide injection for six-months and made a good recovery.
