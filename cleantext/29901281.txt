  The scaffolds accompanied with stem cells have great potential for applications in neural tissue engineering. Fabrication of Nano fibrous scaffold similar to extracellular matrix is one of the applicable methods in neural tissue regeneration. The aim of this study was the fabrication of a silk Nano fibrous scaffold as a microenvironment for neural guiding differentiation of Embryonic stem like cells ( ES Like cells) derived from testis toward neuron-like cells. ES Like derived from culturing of testicular cells in vitro , were seeded on Silk scaffolds and induced to neuronal phenotype using 4-/ 4 ± RA technique following culturing the cells in the neurobasal medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml bFGF ,10 ng/ml EGF , B27 and N2 for 8-12 days. The neural differentiation was confirmed via the evaluation of specific neural markers; Nestin , NF68 , MAP2 and β tubulin using immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR. Our results showed that silk scaffold support the attachment and proliferation of ES Like cells. The expression of Nestin , NF68 , Map2 and ß tubulin markers were higher in cells grown on Silk scaffold in compare to monolayer group. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
