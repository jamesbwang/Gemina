  Human recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor-A121 ( hrVEGF-A121) has applications in pharmaceutical industry especially in regenerative medicine. Here , we report the expression , purification , and characterization of hrVEGF-A121 in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> expression system using human small ubiquitin-related modifier-3 ( hSUMO3) fusion partner. Total RNA was isolated from healthy human gingival tissue , VEGF-A121 gene was RT-PCR amplified , and hSUMO3 gene was tagged at N-terminus. The fusion gene ( SUMO3-VEGF-A121) was cloned in pET-22b ( +) expression vector and transferred into E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> strains; BL21 codon + and Rosetta-gami B ( DE3). The hrVEGF-A121 expression was optimized for temperature , IPTG concentration , and time in Terrific Broth ( TB). The positive transformants were sequenced and hrVEGF-A121 nucleotide sequence was submitted to Genbank ( Accession No. KT581010). Approximately 40 % of total cell protein expression was observed in soluble form on 15 % SDS-PAGE. The hSUMO3 was cleaved from hrVEGF-A121 with SUMO protease and purified by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography using anionic Hi-trap Resource Q column. From 100 ml TB , ~ 25.5 % and ~ 6.8 mg of hrVEGF-A121 protein was recovered. The dimerized hrVEGF-A121 was characterized by Native PAGE and Western blot , using human anti-VEGF-A antibody and ESI-MS showed dimeric hrVEGF-A121 at 31,015 Da. The biological activity of hrVEGF-A121 was assessed in vitro by MTT and cell viability assay and observed to be bioactive.
