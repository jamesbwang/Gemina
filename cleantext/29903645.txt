  Whether sarcopenia predicts incident homebound status remains unclear. This prospective cohort study aimed to determine the impact of sarcopenia on the incidence of homebound status in community-dwelling older adults. The study included 3958 community-dwelling elderly people aged â‰¥ 65 years who were not homebound at baseline. Sarcopenia was defined as the presence of both poor muscle function ( low physical performance or low muscle strength) and low muscle mass. Potential confounding factors , such as physical status , mental<symptom> status<symptom> , and level of social participation , were also assessed. Fifteen months after the baseline measurements , data regarding the incidence of homebound status were obtained using a postal survey. In the 15-month follow-up survey , 83 participants ( 2.1 % , 95 % confidence interval = 1.6-2.5) were reported to have become homebound. A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that age ( odds ratio = 1.06 , 95 % confidence interval = 1.02-1.10) , sarcopenia ( 1.98 , 1.04-3.77) , and limited contact with friends ( 1.82 , 1.03-3.23) were independently associated with an increased risk of becoming homebound. In a stratified analysis for age group , a significant odds ratio for low level of social role ( 2.50 , 1.06-5.91) was observed in young-old subjects ( aged 65-74 years) , whereas significant odds ratios for sarcopenia ( 2.80 , 1.33-5.91) and physical inactivity ( 2.85 , 1.28-6.37) were observed in old-old subjects ( aged 75 years and over). Sarcopenia had a strong impact on the risk of becoming homebound. Particularly in old-old subjects , sarcopenia and physical inactivity may impair people 's ability to engage in activities outside the home much more than either their mental<symptom> status<symptom> or their level of social participation.
