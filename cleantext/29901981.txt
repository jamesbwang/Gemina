  Rhodium nanoparticles are promising transition metal nanocatalysts for electrochemical and synthetic organic chemistry applications. However , notwithstanding their potential , to date , Rh nanoparticles have not been utilized for biological applications; there has been no cytotoxicity study of Rh reported in the literature. In this regard , the absence of a facile and controllable synthetic strategy of Rh nanostructures with various sizes and morphologies might be responsible for the lack of progress in this field. Herein , we have developed a synthetic strategy for Rh nanostructures with controllable morphology through an inverse-directional galvanic replacement reaction. Three types of Rh-based nanostructures-nanoshells , nanoframes , and porous nanoplates-were successfully synthesized. A plausible synthetic mechanism based on thermodynamic considerations has also been proposed. The cytotoxicity , surface functionalization , and photothermal therapeutic effect of manufactured Rh nanostructures were systematically investigated to reveal their potential for in vitro and in vivo biological applications. Considering the comparable behavior of porous Rh nanoplates to that of gold nanostructures that are widely used in nanomedicine , the present study introduces Rh-based nanostructures into the field of biological research.
