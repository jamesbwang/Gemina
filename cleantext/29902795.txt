  Chest drains often become displaced and require replacement , adding unnecessary risks to patients. Simple measures such as suturing of the drain may reduce fall-out rates; however , there is no direct data to demonstrate this and no standardized recommended practice that is evidence based. The study aimed to analyze the rate of chest drain fall out according to suturing practice. Retrospective analysis of all chest drain insertions ( radiology and pleural teams) in 2015-2016. Details of chest drain fall out were collected from patient electronic records. Drain `` fall out '' was pre-hoc defined as the drain tip becoming dislodged outside the pleural cavity unintentionally before a clinical decision was taken to remove the drain. A total of 369 chest drains were inserted: sutured ( n = 106 , 28.7 %; 44 male ( 41.5 %) , median age 74 ( interquartile range ( IQR) 21) years) , and unsutured ( n = 263 , 71.3 %; 139 male ( 52.9 %) , median age 68 ( IQR 21) years). Of the sutured drains , 7 ( 6.6 %) fell out after a mean of 3.3 days ( SD 2.6) compared to 39 ( 14.8 %; p = 0.04) unsutured drains falling out after a mean of 2.7 days ( SD 2.0; p = 0.8). Within the limits of this retrospective analysis , these results- suggest that suturing of drains is associated with lower fall-out rates.
