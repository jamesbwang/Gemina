  While infliximab pharmacokinetics are associated with therapy outcome in adult IBD population , limited data is available in pediatric patients. We aimed to define the relationship between Infliximab trough and antibodies ' levels ( IFX-TL , ATI) and clinical , biomarker remission. IFX-TL and ATI were routinely obtained between 2011-2017. Associations with clinical and inflammatory ( C-reactive protein , CRP) end-points were studied throughout the first year of infliximab therapy. 63 patients ( 50 Crohn 's disease , 13 Ulcerative colitis<disease> , median follow-up 16 months , median 8 samples/patient) were included , and 773 sera-samples were analyzed. Sera of patients in clinical remission had higher median IFX-TLs than sera of those with active disease ( 4 μg/ml versus 2.25 μg/ml , p < 0.0001). In addition , patients with normal CRP had a higher median IFX-TL than those with elevated CRP ( p = 0.02). Moreover , IFX-TL > 9.2 μg/ml at week 2 predicted clinical remission by week 14 ( sensitivity 71.4 % , specificity 81.2 % , AUC = 0.73 , p = 0.02) and IFX-TL > 2.2 μg/ml at week 6 predicted infliximab retention beyond one year of treatment ( sensitivity 88.9 % , specificity 100.0 % , AUC = 0.974 , p < 0.0001). A significant association between IFX-TL and ATI and clinical and biomarker remission status in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) patients was demonstrated , including a temporal association between week 2 , 6 levels and outcome of induction and between week 6 and 14 levels and remission at one year of therapy. These findings suggest that Therapeutic drug monitoring may be considered for management guidance among pediatric IBD patients.
