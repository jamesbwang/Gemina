  To analyse publication and citations trends of case reports within otolaryngology- head and neck surgery literature , with specific attention to the most-cited reports.Study designDatabase query. Web of Science was searched for article type ` case reports ' published in the leading otolaryngology- head and neck surgery journals since 1945. Variables including publication dates , citation dates and numbers , author , author number , and others were recorded and analysed for trends. The reports with the most citations ( classics) were further studied. Of nearly 67 000 published articles in leading otolaryngology- head and neck surgery journals , the overall number of case reports as a percentage of the total has substantially decreased over time. A total of 110 case report classics were identified for which citations have increased. Although the case report may not be worthy of its tarnished record , declining trends in publication suggest a limited future for this valuable research and educational resource.
