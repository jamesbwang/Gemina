  The prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) based prostate cancer ( PC) screening is currently being debated. The current assessment is to understand the variability of detecting high-risk PC in a NZ cohort in comparison to a US cohort with better PSA screening facilities. Aldo-keto reductase 1C3 ( AKR1C3) is known for multiple functions with a potential to regulate subsequent PSA levels. Therefore , we wish to understand the influence of tobacco smoking and the AKR1C3 rs12529 gene polymorphism in this variability. NZ cohort ( n = 376) consisted of 94 % Caucasians while the US cohort consisted of African Americans ( AA) , n = 202 , and European Americans ( EA) , n = 232. PSA level , PC grade and stage at diagnosis were collected from hospital databases for assigning high-risk PC status. Tobacco smoking status and the AKR1C3 rs12529 SNP genotype were considered as confounding variables. Variation of the cumulative % high-risk PC ( outcome variable) with increasing PSA intervals ( exposure factor) was compared between the cohorts using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Comparisons were carried out with and without stratifications made using confounding variables. NZ cohort has been diagnosed at a significantly higher mean age ( 66.67 ± ( 8.08) y) compared to both AA ( 62.65 ± 8.17 y) and EA ( 64.83 +8.56 y); median PSA ( NZ 8.90 ng/ml compared to AA 6.86 ng/ml and EA 5.80 ng/ml); and Gleason sum ( NZ ( 7) compared EA ( 6)) ( p < 0.05). The cumulative % high-risk PC detection shows NZ cohort with a significantly lower diagnosis rates at PSA levels between > 6- < 10ng/ml compared to both US groups ( p < 0.05). These were further compounded significantly by smoking status and genetics. High-risk PCs recorded at higher PSA levels in NZ could be due to factors including lower levels of PSA screening and subsequent specialist referrals for biopsies. These consequences could be pronounced among NZ ever smokers carrying the AKR1C3 rs12529 G alleles making them a group that requires increased PSA screening attention.
