  Inadequate data are available on the global epidemiology of mucormycosis , mainly derived from the evaluation of specific population groups. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is an invading and fatal mycosis<disease> , particularly among diabetic patients. In the present study , patients hospitalised in Imam Reza Hospital in Tabriz , from 2007 to 2017 , were evaluated. The hospital information system ( HIS) was used to collect the records of the patients. A total of 42 patients with a diagnosis of mucormycosis were included in the study , 40 cases ( 95 %) of which had a diagnosis of the rhinocerebral form. Of these 40 patients , 21 ( 52.5 %) and 19 ( 47.5 %) were male and female , respectively. Seven cases ( 17.5 %) of rhinocerebral mucormycosis were due to dental procedures. The most predisposing factor in the patients was diabetes with 36 ( 90 %) cases. In our study , the role of tooth extraction in patients with uncontrolled diabetes was identified as an important factor. It may show the important role of dentists in preventing of the disease in diabetic patients.
