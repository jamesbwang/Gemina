  Agitation is one of the most challenging neuropsychiatric symptoms to treat in Alzheimer 's disease and has significant implications for patient and caregiver. A major source of difficulty in identifying safe and effective treatments for agitation is the lack of validated biomarkers. As such , patients may not be appropriately targeted , and biological response to pharmacotherapy can not be adequately monitored. This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence on the association between biomarkers and agitation/aggression in patients with Alzheimer 's disease , utilizing the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer 's Association Research Framework and the Biomarkers , EndpointS , and other Tools Resource of the Food and Drug Association-National Institutes of Health Biomarker Working Group. This review identified six classes of biomarkers ( neuropathological , neurotransmitter , neuroimaging , apolipoprotein E ( APOE) genotype , inflammatory , and clusterin) associated with agitation/aggression , which were mostly diagnostic in nature. Future studies should investigate the predictive , prognostic , and monitoring capacity of biomarkers to provide insight into the longitudinal course of agitation/aggression , as well as predict and monitor biological response to a pharmacological intervention.
