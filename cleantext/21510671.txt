  We report the development of the SEVENS database , which contains information on G-protein coupled receptor ( GPCR) genes that are identified with high confidence levels ( A , B , C , and D) from various eukaryotic genomes , by using a pipeline comprising bioinformatics softwares , including a gene finder , a sequence alignment tool , a motif and domain assignment tool , and a transmembrane helix predictor. SEVENS compiles detailed information on GPCR genes , such as chromosomal mapping position , phylogenetic tree , sequence similarity to known genes , and protein function described by motif/domain and transmembrane helices. They are presented in a user-friendly interface. Because of the comprehensive gene findings from genomes , SEVENS contains a larger data set than that of previous databases and enables the performance of a genome-scale overview of all the GPCR genes. We surveyed the complete genomes of 68 eukaryotes , and found that there were between 6 and 3,470 GPCR genes for each genome ( Level A data). Within these genes , the number of receptors for various molecules , including biological amines , peptides , and lipids , were conserved in mammals , birds , and fishes , whereas the numbers of odorant receptors and pheromone receptors were highly diverse in mammals.
