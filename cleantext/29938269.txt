  The structural and electronic properties of bilayer ( AA- and AB-stacked) and tri-layer ( AAA- , ABA- and AAB-stacked) penta-graphene ( PG) have been investigated in the framework of density functional theory. The present results demonstrate that the ground state energy in AB stacking is lower than that in AA stacking , whereas ABA stacking is found to be the most energetically favorable , followed by AAB and AAA stackings. All considered model configurations are found to be semiconducting , independent of the stacking sequence. In the presence of a perpendicular electric field , their band gaps can be significantly reduced and completely closed at a specific critical electric field strength , demonstrating a Stark effect. These findings show that few-layer PG will have tremendous opportunities to be applied in nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices owing to its tunable band gap.
