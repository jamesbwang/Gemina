  The clinical success of the platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents has prompted the investigation of coordination and organometallic complexes of alternative metal centers for use as anticancer agents. Among these alternatives , the third row transition metal neighbors of platinum on the periodic table have only recently been explored for their potential to yield anticancer-active complexes. In this Perspective , we summarize developments within the last six years on the application of rhenium , osmium , and iridium complexes as anticancer drug candidates. This review focuses on studies that discuss the potential mechanisms of action of these complexes. As reflected in this Perspective , complexes of these metal ions induce cancer cell death via a diverse range of mechanisms. Notably , small structural changes can significantly alter the mode of cell death , hindering efforts to elucidate structure-activity relationships. This property may both benefit and hinder the clinical development of these compounds.
