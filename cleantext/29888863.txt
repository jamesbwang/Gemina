  Beneficial effects produced by polyphenolic compounds are used in the treatment of various diseases , including diabetes. Thus it is relevant to investigate the protective effect of lingonberry extract ( LB) on the activities of nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase ( NTPDase) , 5 '- nucleotidase ( 5 '- NT) , and adenosine deaminase ( ADA); the density of A1 , A2A , and P2 Ã— 7 receptors; production of reactive species ( RS); and the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARS) in the cerebral cortex of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Animals were divided into five groups ( n = 10): control/saline; control/LB 50 mg kg This study showed that LB could reverse the modifications found in the diabetic state , suggesting that lingonberry may be a coadjuvant in the treatment of diabetes.
