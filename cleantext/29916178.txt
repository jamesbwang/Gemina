  Freshwater planarian species S. mediterranea is an emerging stem cell model because of its capability of regenerating large portions of missing body parts. It is one of the best model systems available to address the basic biological mechanisms in the regeneration processes. Absolute quantification of metabolites from planarians is imperative to understand their role in the regeneration processes. Here we describe a stable isotope dilution ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/selected reaction monitoring ( UHPLC-MS/SRM) assay for a sensitive and quantitative assessment of neurotransmitters ( NTs) in planaria. We used this method for the simultaneous quantification of 16 NTs from both intact and regenerating planarians.
