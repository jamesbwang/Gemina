  In this study , we evaluated and compared the morphogenetic variability and the degree of recessive homozygosity in patients with manifested ischemic stroke compared to healthy controls. We have evaluated 120 patients with manifested ischemic stroke , of which 64 did not have hypertension and 56 have hypertension. For comparison , we additionally tested 194 healthy individuals without manifested ischemic stroke ( controls). For the estimation of the degree of recessive homozygosity , we have performed the homozygously recessive characteristics ( HRC) test and tested 19 HRCs. There was a significant difference in the individual variations of 19 HRCs between the controls and patients with manifested ischemic stroke ( & sum; & chi; Â² = 60.162 ,
