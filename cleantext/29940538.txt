  In the present study , series of eleven ( 2E) -1- ( 4- ( 1H-imidazol-1-yl) substituted phenyl) -3-phenylprop-2-en-1-one ( IM1-IM11) derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of recombinant human monoamine oxidase ( MAO) A and B. The results indicate that ( 2E) -3- ( 4- ( dimethylamino) phenyl) -1- ( 4- ( 1H-imidazol-1-yl) phenyl) prop-2-en-1-one ( IM5) is a nonselective and reversible competitive inhibitor of MAO-A and MAO-B with IC
