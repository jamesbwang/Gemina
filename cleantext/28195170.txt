  The emotional stress response is relevant to a number of psychiatric disorders , including posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) in particular. Research using neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) to probe stress-related neural processing have provided some insights into psychiatric disorders. Treatment providers and individual patients would benefit from clinically useful fMRI paradigms that provide information about patients ' current brain state and responses to stress in order to inform the treatment selection process. However , neuroimaging has not yet made a meaningful impact on real-world clinical practice. This lack of clinical utility may be related to a number of basic psychometric properties that are often overlooked during fMRI task development. The goals of the current review are to discuss important methodological considerations for current human fMRI stress-related paradigms and to provide a roadmap for developing methodologically sound and clinically useful paradigms. This would include establishing various aspects of reliability , including internal consistency , test-retest and multi-site , as well as validity , including face , content , construct , and criterion. In addition , the establishment of standardized normative data from a large sample of participants would support our understanding of how any one individual compares to the general population. Addressing these methodological gaps will likely have a powerful effect on improving the replicability of findings and optimize our chances for improving real-world clinical outcomes.
