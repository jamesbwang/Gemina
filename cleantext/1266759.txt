  Pulmonary vein varix is an unusual cause of a mediastinal mass on a chest radiograph. It may be found as an isolated malformation or as a sequela of pulmonary venous hypertension. We encountered a case presenting with left hemiparesis<symptom> and a past medical history of rheumatic heart disease. The chest radiograph revealed a well-defined mediastinal mass that turned out to be a hugely dilated pulmonary vein on contrast enhanced computed tomography of the chest. The computed tomography of the brain and upper abdomen revealed bilateral cerebral infarction and splenic infarction. In the literature , one-third of the reported cases of pulmonary vein varix are acquired secondary to mitral valve disease.
