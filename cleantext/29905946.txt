  Sea squirt ( Halocynthia roretzi) shell protein ( SSP) was used as a biodegradable film material and laminated with polylactic acid ( PLA) to improve its physical and water barrier properties. Cinnamon bark oil ( CBO) was incorporated into the SSP film as a bioactive material. After laminating with PLA , the tensile strength and elongation at break of the SSP film increased from 4.07 to 9.09 MPa and from 8.68 to 138.84 % , respectively. In addition , water vapor permeability and water solubility decreased from 5.62 to 0.91 Ã— 10 Sea squirt shell has been discarded after the consumption of sea squirt , and sea squirt shell protein can be a base material for biodegradable films. In this study , sea squirt shell protein and polylactic acid laminated films containing cinnamon bark essential oil were developed. The developed films are promising environmentally-friendly alternatives for active packaging material.
