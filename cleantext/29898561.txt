  In irrigated crop production , nitrogen ( N) is often applied at high rates in order to maximize crop yield. With such high rates , the blue water footprint ( WF) per unit of crop is low , but the N-related grey WF per unit of crop yield is relatively high. This study explores the trade-off between blue and grey WF at different N-application rates ( from 25 to 300 kg N ha
