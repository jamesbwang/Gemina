  If our central representation of an object is defined through embodied experience , we might expect access to action affordances to be privileged over more abstract concepts. We used event-related potentials to examine the relative time course of access to affordances. Written object names were primed with the name of an object sharing the same affordance as the target ( e.g. precision-grip: `` grape '' primed by `` tweezers '') or the same taxonomic category ( e.g. fruit: `` grape '' primed by `` apple ''). N200 latencies , related to go/nogo semantic category decisions on target words , revealed no difference in facilitation provided by affordance and semantic priming. However , separate analyses of ERPs for go and nogo trials showed that semantic priming led to earlier activation during go trials ( around 430 ms) , and affordance priming led to earlier activation during nogo trials ( around 180 ms). While affordances appear to be peripheral to the conceptual representation of objects , they do lead to direct motor preparation.
