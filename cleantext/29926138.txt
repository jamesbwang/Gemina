  To compare dual-energy CT ( DECT) iodine overlay images with renal mass protocol CT in the evaluation of polycystic kidneys with respect to reading time , diagnostic confidence , and detection of renal lesions<symptom> that are not definitively benign. Following IRB approval , portal venous phase dual-source DECT scans performed between September 2013 and February 2016 from 55 patients ( mean age 67 ± 15 years , 31 male , 24 female) with polycystic kidneys ( 4 or more cysts<symptom>) were included. For each patient , two image sets were created: ( 1) DECT post-processed iodine overlay images and ( 2) simulated renal mass protocol CT images ( virtual noncontrast and mixed images). Two radiologists independently retrospectively reviewed both sets at separate time points , evaluating for the presence of lesions<symptom> that were not definitively benign ( enhancing lesions<symptom> or Bosniak IIF cysts<symptom>) , as well as reading times and Likert scale diagnostic confidence ratings ( scaled 1-5) for the presence of non-benign lesions<symptom>. Reading times were compared with a t test , diagnostic confidence with a McNemar test , and lesion<symptom> number detection with Cohen 's kappa test. Iodine overlay images were read faster ( mean 55 ± 26 s) than renal mass protocol ( mean 105 ± 51 s) ( p < 0.001). Readers assigned the highest diagnostic confidence rating in 64 % using iodine overlay series , compared to 17 % using renal mass protocol ( p < 0.0001). The proportion of patients with recorded lesions<symptom> was not significantly different between methods ( p = 0.62). DECT improves lesion<symptom> assessment in polycystic kidneys by decreasing reading times and increasing diagnostic confidence , without affecting lesion<symptom> detection rates.
