  The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of biocide resistant genes , qacA , qacE and cepA in multidrug resistant ( MDR) bacteria: Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> and Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> and to correlate the presence or absence of resistant genes with biocides susceptibility. The study included 44 MDR K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> and A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> microorganisms. The bacteria were screened for the presence of biocide resistant genes by the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) method. The test organisms were isolated from various clinical specimens in the Qassim region , Saudi Arabia. The in vitro susceptibility tests of the three biocides ( benzalkonium chloride , cetrimide and chlorhexidine gluconate) were studied against the test isolates by broth microdilution method following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. With the distribution of biocide resistant genes in K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , all 9 isolates ( 100 %) possessed cepA; 4 ( 44.4 %) and 1 ( 11.1 %) isolate contained qacA and qacE genes respectively. Among 24 isolates of A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> tested , cepA , qacA and qacE genes were found in 54.2 % , 16.7 % and 33.3 % of isolates respectively. Among 11 P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> isolates , 63.6 % contained cepA gene , 18.2 % contained qacE genes , and none of the isolates harboured qacA gene. There was no significant correlation between presence or absence of biocide resistant genes and high MIC values of the test isolates ( p â‰¥ 0.2). Our observations imply that there was no significant correlation between presence or absence of biocide resistant genes and MICs observed in MDR K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> , P.<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> and A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen>. Further studies are required to find to confirm the trend of reduced susceptibility to biocides of problematic nosocomial pathogens.
