  Collagens are large secreted trimeric proteins making up most of the animal extracellular matrix. Secretion of collagen has been a focus of interest for cell biologists in recent years because collagen trimers are too large and rigid to fit into the COPII vesicles mediating transport from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) to the Golgi. Collagen-specific mechanisms to create enlarged ER-to-Golgi transport carriers have been postulated , including cargo loading by conserved ER exit site ( ERES) protein Tango1. Here , we report an RNAi screening for genes involved in collagen secretion in Drosophila. In this screening , we examined distribution of GFP-tagged Collagen IV in live animals and found 88 gene hits for which the knockdown produced intracellular accumulation of Collagen IV in the fat body , the main source of matrix proteins in the larva. Among these hits , only two affected collagen secretion specifically: PH4Î±EFB and Plod , encoding enzymes known to mediate posttranslational modification of collagen in the ER. Every other intracellular accumulation hit affected general secretion , consistent with the notion that secretion of collagen does not use a specific mode of vesicular transport , but the general secretory pathway. Included in our hits are many known players in the eukaryotic secretory machinery , like COPII and COPI components , SNAREs and Rab-GTPase regulators. Our further analysis of the involvement of Rab-GTPases in secretion shows that Rab1 , Rab2 and RabX3 , are all required at ERES , each of them differentially affecting ERES morphology. Abolishing activity of all three by Rep knockdown , in contrast , led to uncoupling of ERES and Golgi. We additionally present a characterization of a screening hit we named trabuco ( tbc) , encoding an ERES-localized TBC domain-containing Rab-GAP. Finally , we discuss the success of our screening in identifying secretory pathway genes in comparison to two previous secretion screenings in Drosophila S2 cells.
