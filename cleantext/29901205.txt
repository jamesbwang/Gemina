  In the present study , the effects and underlying mechanism of RbAp48 on the radiosensitivity of AGS gastric cancer cells was investigated. Cell proliferation was determined with an MTT assay. Flow cytometry was performed to evaluate the cell cycle and apoptosis. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were performed to detect mRNA and protein expression , respectively , including RbAp48 , phosphoinositide 3‑kinase ( PI3K) and protein kinase B ( Akt). The results revealed that radiation enhanced the expression level of RbAp48 in AGS cells , and that RbAp48 combined with radiation reduced AGS cell proliferation. In addition , RbAp48 combined with radiation resulted in G2 phase arrest and induced apoptosis via regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. In conclusion , it was demonstrated that overexpression of RbAp48 enhanced the radiosensitivity of AGS gastric cancer cells via suppression of PI3K/Akt pathway activity , suggesting that RbAp48 may hold potential as a gene therapeutic strategy in the future , aiding in the treatment of gastric cancer.
