  Improving the knowledge of angiomyolipoma physiopathology might help in refining its pharmacological treatment. We investigated if angiomyolipoma cells have migratory properties , how their growth and motility can be influenced by the hormonal milieu , and if this can be related to a specific gender. Primary cells were isolated from angiomyolipomas surgically resected for therapeutical reasons in a female and in a male patient. The genetic control demonstrated no TSC2 deletion. Bi- ( wound<disease> healing) and three-dimensional ( transwell assay) migration were analyzed in vitro in basal conditions and under the influence of 17- β-estradiol and SDF-1α. Treatment up to 72 hours with 17-β-estradiol ( 0.1-100 nM) , tamoxifen ( 0.2-20 μM) or with both , does not modify angiomyolipoma cells proliferation. On the other hand , SDF-1α and 17-β-estradiol treatment induce a significant motility increase ( both bi- and three-dimensional) which becomes evident already after 2 hours of incubation. Angiomyolipoma cells express mRNA coding for SDF-1α and 17-β-estradiol receptors and secrete both the metalloproteases principally involved in malignant phenotype acquisition , i.e. MMP-2 and MMP-9. Angiomyolipoma cells behave similarly , despite their different source. Primary angiomyolipoma cells migrate in response to hormonal milieu and soluble factors , and produce active metalloproteases , both aspects being consistent with the theory claiming they can migrate to the lungs ( and/or other organs) and colonizing them. No main feature , among the aspects we analyzed , seems to be referable to the gender of origin.
