  The `` Breakout Boxes '' activity is an interactive teaching strategy in which students work in teams to solve puzzles. By unlocking boxes that hold additional clues for opening more boxes , students eventually solve the puzzle. The aim of this study was to gain insight on student perceptions of the use of Breakout Boxes as an active learning strategy in nursing education and determine if it should be used in future courses. Thirty-nine students who participated in the Breakout Boxes activity agreed that the use of the strategy was fun and suggested that it be used in future courses.
