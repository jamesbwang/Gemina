  The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation and interaction between the air pollution 's components with cardiopulmonary endurance of elderly people in eight regions by using a multi-modal and correlation analysis. The data of air pollution was collected in eight selected regions in 2013 to 2015. At the same time , total number of 880 male and female , older than 65 year-olds , were investigated based on the cardiopulmonary endurance measurement in the same regions. The correlation , interaction and multiple linear regressions was tested between the air pollution components in each region and cardiopulmonary endurance of elderly people , also between the air pollution components in each region and gender , respectively. In this case , the regression analysis for both hypotheses was conducted. There was a correlation between the level of air pollution and cardiopulmonary endurance , especially for the carbon monoxide which has a strong effect , it was followed by the effect of sulfur dioxide and fine dust , meanwhile nitrogen dioxide seems not to be effective for this measurement test. Furthermore , it was highly unlikely that gender was a significant factor for the correlation between air pollution and cardiopulmonary endurance. The importance and correlation between air pollution and cardiopulmonary capacity is a critical determinant for the public health of a society , while at the same time having a serious impact on certain age groups. Provided that the factor of gender is highly unlikely to modify this impact , it is necessary to study the potential of other factors.
