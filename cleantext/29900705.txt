  Histopathological image analysis of stained tissue slides is routinely used in tumor detection and classification. However , diagnosis requires a highly trained pathologist and can thus be time-consuming , labor-intensive , and potentially risk bias. Here , we demonstrate a potential complementary approach for diagnosis. We show that multiphoton microscopy images from unstained , reproductive tissues can be robustly classified using deep learning techniques. We fine-train four pretrained convolutional neural networks using over 200 murine tissue images based on combined second-harmonic generation and two-photon excitation fluorescence contrast , to classify the tissues either as healthy or associated with high-grade serous carcinoma with over 95 % sensitivity and 97 % specificity. Our approach shows promise for applications involving automated disease diagnosis. It could also be readily applied to other tissues , diseases , and related classification problems.
