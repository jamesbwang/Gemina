  We consider the two-dimensional motion of a particle in a confining potential , subject to Brownian orthogonal forces associated with two different temperatures. Exact solutions are obtained for an asymmetric harmonic potential in the overdamped and underdamped regimes. For more general confining potentials , a perturbative approach shows that the stationary state exhibits some universal properties. The nonequilibrium stationary state is characterized with a nonzero orthoradial mean current , corresponding to a global rotation of the particle around the center. The rotation is due to two broken symmetries: two different temperatures and a mismatch between the principal axes of the confining asymmetric potential and the temperature axes. We confirm our predictions by performing a Brownian dynamics simulation. Finally , we propose to observe this effect on a laser-cooled atomic gas.
