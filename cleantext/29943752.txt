  To perform an analysis of the perception of alcohol use among workers of the transportation , healthcare and building sectors. A survey was carried out on alcohol consumption and knowledge of deriving health effects. Socio-demographic characteristics of the workers were collected. Risk indexes for habitual alcohol and binge consumption were calculated. The number of workers entering the survey is 3,914 ( 57 % males; 58 % married). Two-thirds of the sample reported good knowledge of alcohol-related risks that could occur at the workplace , and 55 % of alcohol-related health risks. Binge drinking is inversely associated with female gender , good perceived health and good knowledge of alcohol-related risks at the workplace and of alcohol-related health risks. People who are single , young and working in the building sector show higher odds for binge drinking. The habitual use is positively associated with marital status ( OR = 1.51 for single) and working sector ( in the building sector OR = 3.28; in the healthcare OR = 1.90); and inversely associated with good health ( OR = 0.70) , good knowledge of alcohol-related risks at the workplace ( OR = 0.54) and of alcohol-related health risks ( OR = 0.41). Socio-demographic factors , such as age , gender and marital status are associated with different patterns of alcohol consumption , that in turn are inversely associated with good knowledge of alcohol-related risks at the workplace and of alcohol-related health risks. These results suggest the need to increase knowledge of alcohol-related issues among the workers , both at the workplace and in everyday life.
