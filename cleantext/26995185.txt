  Inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> ( ID) are incurable , progressive diseases. Literature evidence cites increasing incidence of these diseases worldwide. When treatments with chemical immunosuppressive agents fail , patients are often treated with monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs). However , MAb failure rates are generally high , with approximately half the patients being discontinued within 4 years , necessitating switching to another MAb. One potential cause of treatment failure is subtherapeutic exposure. Several studies demonstrated associations between trough MAb concentrations and clinical response , supporting the notion that improving drug exposure may result in improved outcomes. MAbs exhibit complex and highly variable pharmacokinetics in ID patients with numerous factors affecting clearance. Bayesian-guided dosing with dashboard systems is a new tool being investigated in the treatment of ID to reduce variability in exposure. Simulations suggest dashboards will be effective at maintaining patients at target troughs. However , when patients are dosed using doses or intervals outside those listed in prescribing information , there is concern that patients may have drug exposures beyond or below the ranges found to be safe and efficacious. This manuscript reviews the rationale behind dashboard development , evaluations of expected performance , and a simulated assessment of MAb exposure with dashboard-based dosing versus dosing based on the prescribing information. We introduce the concept of pharmacologic equivalence-if patients are dosed based on individual pharmacokinetics , the resulting exposure is consistent with exposures achieved using labeled dosing. We further show that dashboard-based dosing results in observed exposures that are generally contained within the range of exposures achieved with labeled dosing.
