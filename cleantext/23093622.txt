  Cancer therapy has evolved significantly with increased adoption of biologic agents ( `` biologics ''). That evolution is especially true for her2 ( human epidermal growth factor receptor-2)- positive breast cancer with the introduction of trastuzumab , a monoclonal antibody against the her2 receptor , which , in combination with chemotherapy , significantly improves survival in both metastatic and early disease. Although the efficacy of biologics is undeniable , their expense is a significant contributor to the increasing cost of cancer care. Across disease sites and indications , biosimilar agents are rapidly being developed with the goal of offering cost-effective alternatives to biologics. Biosimilars are pharmaceuticals whose molecular shape , efficacy , and safety are similar , but not identical , to those of the original product. Although these agents hold the potential to improve patient access , complexities in their production , evaluation , cost , and clinical application have raised questions among experts. Here , we review the landscape of biosimilar agents in oncology , with a focus on trastuzumab biosimilars. We discuss important considerations that must be made as these agents are introduced into routine cancer care.
