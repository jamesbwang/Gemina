  Viral bronchiolitis<disease> is one of the most common causes of hospitalisation in young infants. It has previously been shown that many United Kingdom ( UK) hospital Trusts were not compliant with many aspects of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE) bronchiolitis<disease> guideline prior to its publication. This study aimed to investigate changes in the management of bronchiolitis<disease> by hospital Trusts between 2015 ( before NICE guideline publication) and 2017 , after publication. We prospectively surveyed paediatricians at UK hospital Trusts on the management of bronchiolitis<disease> before ( March to May 2015) and after ( January to May 2017) the NICE bronchiolitis<disease> guideline publication in June 2015 , using an electronic , structured questionnaire. In 2015 111 Trusts were represented and in 2017 100 Trusts. Significant improvements were seen in the use of nebulised bronchodilators and hypertonic saline and provision of parental written guidance. However , full compliance with the guideline did not change with 18 % of Trusts compliant before publication of the guideline in 2015 and 19 % fully compliant with the guideline in 2017. Overall there were modest but important improvements in the reported management of bronchiolitis<disease> after the publication of the NICE guideline.
