  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) published `` The Report to Congress on the Management of Traumatic Brain Injury in Children '' in the spring of 2018. The report is a call to action for professionals providing care for children with traumatic brain injury in the health , social , and educational sectors and for researchers , administrators , and agencies to develop strategies to improve outcomes. For pediatric rehabilitation providers there are clear opportunities to improve service delivery for individual patients and for the population of children after traumatic brain injury more generally. Notably there is a workforce shortage , and fragmentation exists among the various systems that serve children with traumatic brain injuries and their families.
