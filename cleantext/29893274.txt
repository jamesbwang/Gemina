  Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT) and heat-based ablation ( HBA) are both potentially safe and effective treatments for primary and metastatic lung tumors. Both are suboptimal for centrally located tumors , with SBRT having a higher risk of significant toxicity and HBA having lower efficacy. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of combination SBRT-HBA to determine whether combined treatment can result in superior outcomes to each treatment alone. Patients with 1 or 2 primary or metastatic lung tumors ≤ 5 cm in size were enrolled in a prospective phase 2 trial and treated with SBRT in 3 fractions followed by HBA. Tumors < 1 cm from the central bronchial tree received a total of 36 Gy , and tumors 1 to 2 cm away received 42 Gy. HBA was delivered within 10 days after SBRT. The primary endpoints were local control , toxicity , and degree of decline in lung function. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival. We treated 16 patients with 17 tumors. The median follow-up time was 26 months. Fifteen tumors were evaluable for local control. The 1- and 2-year actuarial local control rates were 93 % and 81 % , respectively. Three patients had grade ≥ 3 toxicity: bronchial stenosis , pain , and pulmonary<symptom> hemorrhage<symptom>. The percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second and functional vital capacity decreased by 8 % and 8.5 % , respectively , at 3 months after treatment ( P < .001 for both). Combining SBRT and HBA for centrally located lung tumors offers reasonable local control and toxicity despite the anatomic challenges of this location. HBA may be a reasonable supplement to SBRT when trachea and bronchus , large vessel , or esophageal constraints can not be met with full-dose SBRT and a biologically effective dose < 100 Gy is delivered because of an ultra-central location or large tumor size.
