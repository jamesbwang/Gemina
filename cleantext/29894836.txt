  Seeded emulsion polymerization of 2-dimethylaminoethylamino methacrylate ( DMAEMA) was carried out using monodispersed poly ( 2-hydroxyehtyl methacrylate) ( PHEMA) seeds to produce Janus particles. Three feeding approaches were used comprising one together , rest and continuous feeding methods to investigate different morphologies. However , FE-SEM results showed that all feeding approaches yielded dumbbell-like Janus particles. Furthermore , snowman-like Janus particles were obtained via seeded distillation precipitation polymerization ( DPP). It is shown that minimizing the total interfacial free energy alongside difference in solubility parameters of Janus domains are responsible for obtained morphologies. Two different morphologies ( dumbbell-like and snowman-like) were chosen as carriers of ibuprofen and DOX simultaneously. Also , simultaneous release of two drugs were investigated in different conditions. Dumbbell-like Janus particles showed higher ibuprofen loading whereas DOX was more loaded onto snowman-like Janus particles. Also , DOX was released more rapidly through Janus particles at different pH values and both types of Janus particles showed similar drugs release behaviors.
