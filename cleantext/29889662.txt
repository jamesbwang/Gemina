  The purpose of the present review is to describe the major barriers to HIV<pathogen> eradication and assess the most promising cure strategies under investigation. There are significant challenges to achieve HIV<pathogen> eradication. These include the establishment of persistent latently infected cells , systemic chronic immune activation , and immune dysfunction. Since the announcement of the first HIV<pathogen> cure involving the Berlin patient , several attempts to reproduce these results have failed. Thus , it is widely accepted that long-term HIV<pathogen> remission would be a more feasible approach. Optimization of ART , immune-based therapies , therapeutic vaccinations , and gene editing , amongst others , are strategies aimed at controlling HIV<pathogen> in the absence of ART. These new strategies alone or in combination are being developed in preclinical studies and clinical trials and will provide further insight into whether long-term HIV<pathogen> remission is possible. The present review discusses several mechanisms that mediate the persistence of the HIV<pathogen> reservoir , clinical cases that provide hope in finding a functional cure of HIV<pathogen> , and promising interventional strategies being tested in preclinical studies and clinical trials that attempt to reduce the HIV<pathogen> reservoirs and/or boost the immune responses to control HIV<pathogen> in the absence of ART.
