  This study aimed to investigate whether dexmedetomidine had sedative weaning advantage for extubation after airway foreign body ( FB) removal in children. A retrospective case-cohort comparison study with total of 57 critical children who required mechanical ventilation after rigid bronchoscopy was performed. After tracheal intubation , group D ( received dexmedetomidine 1 µg/kg over 10 min , followed by an infusion of 0.8 µg/kg/h) , and group RP ( received remifentanil-propofol 6-10 µg/kg/h and 1-3 mg/kg/h , respectively). The primary outcome was successful extubation rate on first weaning trial. The minor outcomes included weaning time , emergency agitation , coughing score and the incidence of respiratory adverse complications on emergency. All 57 patients were included in the analysis , with 30 patients in group D and 27 controlled cases in group RP. The success rate of first weaning trial in the D group was 96.7 vs 77.8 % in the RP group , risk ratio ( RR) 1.56 , 95 % CI ( 0.78-1.98). Time for resuming spontaneous breathing after termination infusion was shorter in the D group ( median 8 min , IQR 15 min) vs RP group ( median 12 min , IQR 19 min , P = 0.02 , RR 0.56 , 95 % CI 0.14-6.57). In mechanical ventilation of pediatric patients following rigid bronchoscopy , in comparison to remifentanil-propofol , dexmedetomidine is proved to have high success rate for weaning strategy. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN?: Remifentanil is proved to be effective for weaning in ICU patients. Dexmedetomedine can provide similar rates of smooth extubation for pediatric patients who underwent airway surgery. WHAT THIS ARTICLE ADDS?: Invasive ventilation is used for patients with severe comorbidity after airway surgery , but the correct strategy for pediatric extubation after removal of airway foreign body remains unclear. For these patients with short-term mechanical ventilation , dexmedetomedine may improve the extubation rate , when compared with remifentanil-propofol.
