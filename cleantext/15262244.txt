  Inflammatory and degenerative activity inside the joint can be studied in vivo via analysis of synovial fluid ( SF) biomarkers , which are molecular markers of inflammatory processes and tissue turnover. The aim of this study was to investigate the response of selected biomarkers in the SF after an intra-articular ( IA) high-molecular-weight non-animal stabilized hyaluronic acid ( NASHA) treatment. Our hypothesis was that prostaglandin E CS846 concentration decreased in the NASHA group only ( P = 0.010). Both PGE Although the SF concentration of the cartilage-derived biomarker CS846 decreased in the NASHA group , no statistically significant treatment effect of any of the biomarkers were observed between treatment groups. The significant increase in SF white blood cell count after IA NASHA may indicate a mild inflammatory response. However , as no clinical adverse effects were observed , we conclude that IA NASHA was well tolerated.
