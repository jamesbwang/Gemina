  Elucidation of the interactions between plants and insects will facilitate better insect control in crops. Brassinosteroids ( BRs) play a vital role in plant growth , developmental process and pathogens infection , but the role of BR in interactions between plants and insects remains largely unknown. Here , we characterized a negative role of BR in rice defense against brown planthopper ( BPH , Nilaparvata lugens St√•l) and explored its underlying mechanism. We found that BPH infestation suppressed the BR pathway while activated the SA and JA pathways successively. Moreover , BR-overproducing mutants and plants treated with 24-epibrassinolide ( BL) showed increased susceptibility to BPH , whereas BR-deficient mutant was more resistant than the wild type. BR downregulated the expression of SA pathway-related genes and reduced SA content while upregulated JA pathway-related genes and increased JA content after BPH infestation. Furthermore , BR-mediated suppression of the SA pathway was impaired both in JA-deficient and JA-insensitive mutants. Our results highlight that BR promotes the susceptibility of rice plants to BPH by modulating the SA and JA pathways.
