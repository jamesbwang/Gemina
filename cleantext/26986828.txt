  When people make decisions about sequentially presented items in psychophysical experiments , their decisions are always biased by their preceding decisions and the preceding items , either by assimilation ( shift towards the decision or item) or contrast ( shift away from the decision or item). Such sequential biases also occur in naturalistic and real-world judgments such as facial attractiveness judgments. In this article , we aimed to cast light on the causes of these sequential biases. We first found significant assimilative and contrastive effects in a visual face attractiveness judgment task and an auditory ringtone agreeableness judgment task , indicating that sequential effects are not limited to the visual modality. We then found that the provision of trial-by-trial feedback of the preceding stimulus value eliminated the contrastive effect , but only weakened the assimilative effect. When participants orally reported their judgments rather than indicated them via a keyboard button press , we found a significant diminished assimilative effect , suggesting that motor<symptom> response<symptom> repetition strengthened the assimilation bias. Finally , we found that when visual and auditory stimuli were alternated , there was no longer a contrastive effect from the immediately previous trial , but there was an assimilative effect both from the previous trial ( cross-modal) and the 2-back trial ( same stimulus modality). These findings suggested that the contrastive effect results from perceptual processing , while the assimilative effect results from anchoring of the previous judgment and is strengthened by response repetition and numerical priming.
