  Glycerol kinase ( GK) and glycerol-3- phosphate oxidase ( GPO) nanoparticles ( NPs) were prepared , characterized and immobilized onto pencil graphite ( PG) electrode to fabricate an improved amperometric glycerol biosensor ( GKNPs/GPONPs/PGE). GKNPs/GPONPs/PGE worked in optimum conditions of pH 7.0 , temperature 30 °C , at an applied potential of -0.3 V. The biosensor exhibited wide linear response in a concentration range of glycerol ( 0.01-45 mM) with detection limit 0.0001 μM. The biosensor revealed high sensitivity ( 7.24 μAmM
