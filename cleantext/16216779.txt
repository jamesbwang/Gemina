  Healthy , functional mitochondria are central to many cellular and physiological phenomena , including aging , metabolism , and stress resistance. A key feature of healthy mitochondria is a high membrane potential ( Δψ) or charge differential ( i.e. , proton gradient) between the matrix and inner mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial Δψ has been extensively characterized via flow cytometry of intact cells , which measures the average membrane potential within a cell. However , the characteristics of individual mitochondria differ dramatically even within a single cell , and thus interrogation of mitochondrial features at the organelle level is necessary to better understand and accurately measure heterogeneity. Here we describe a new flow cytometric methodology that enables the quantification and classification of mitochondrial subtypes ( via their Δψ , size , and substructure) using the small animal model C. elegans.<pathogen> Future application of this methodology should allow research to discern the bioenergetic and mitochondrial component in a number of human<pathogen> disease<pathogen> and aging models , including , C. elegans<pathogen> , cultured cells , small animal models , and human biopsy samples. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
