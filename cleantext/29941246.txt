  CuO nanomaterials were synthesized by a simple solution phase method using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ( CTAB) as a surfactant and their photocatalytic property was determined towards the visible-light assisted degradation of Reactive Black-5 dye. A detailed mechanism for the formation of CuO nanostructures has been proposed. The effect of various experimental parameters such as catalyst amount , dye concentration , pH and oxidizing agent on the dye degradation efficiency was studied. About 87 % dye was degraded at pH2 in the presence of CuO nanosheets under visible light. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of CuO nanosheets can be ascribed to good crystallinity , grain size , surface morphology and a strong absorption in the visible region. CuO is found to be a promising catalyst for industrial waste water treatment.
