  Identification of deteriorating severe hand , foot , and mouth<pathogen> disease<pathogen> ( HFMD) children for referral to intensive care remains problematic.The medical records of 2382 hospitalized children with severe HFMD from May 2013 to September 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. A Pediatric Early Warning System ( PEWS) score was designed based on study parameters on admission , evaluated in a logistic regression model , and subsequently validated with different cut-off scores , to predict the risk for clinical deterioration.After admission , 191 cases were transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU) and 2191 were admitted to the infectious<pathogen> disease<pathogen> department. Of which , 116 cases were subsequently transferred to PICU , with younger age , consciousness<pathogen> levels of sluggishness , lethargy<pathogen> or drowsiness<pathogen> , rashes<pathogen> with vesicles on the hands or feet , moderate or high fever<pathogen> , increased or disordered lung marking or pulmonary infiltration , abnormal heart rate , fasting plasma glucose , blood platelet , and C-reactive protein. A corresponding 10-component PEWS score > 7 was significantly associated with subsequent transfer to PICU.A 10-component PEWS score > 7 has good specificity but poor sensitivity for identifying severe HFMD children vulnerable to clinical deterioration.
