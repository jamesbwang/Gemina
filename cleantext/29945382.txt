  This study was performed to investigate the guaianolides from the aerial parts of Artemisia myriantha. The chemical constituents were isolated by chromatographic columns over silica gel , Sephadex LH-20 , and ODS , as well as Semi-prep HPLC methods , and their structures were identified by NMR and MS data. Ten compounds were isolated and identified as follows: artemyriantholide E ( 1) , tanaphillin ( 2) , 1β , 10β-epoxydehydroleucodin ( 3) , 5-hydroxyleucodin ( 4) , dehydrocostuslactone ( 5) , 3-O-methyl-iso-secotanapartholide ( 6) , roxbughianin A ( 7) , dehydroleucodin ( 8) , arglabin ( 9) , and 8α-acetoxyarglabin ( 10). Compound 1 was a new compound , and compounds 2-7 were isolated from this plant for the first time. Compound 3 exhibited selective cytotoxicity against human liver cancer ( Bel-7402) with IC ₅₀ value of 5.35 μmol · L ⁻¹ , and 6 against human gastric cancer ( BGC-823) with IC ₅₀ value of 2.68 μmol · L ⁻¹ , respectively.
