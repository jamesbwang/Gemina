  Oxidative stress secondary to bile-acid exposure has been associated with metaplastic degeneration of normal esophageal mucosa into Barrett 's esophagus ( BE) cells and eventually esophageal adenocarcinoma. We previously reported that the macromolecular response of BE cells to this stress was largely regulated by the expression of manganese-dependent mitochondrial superoxide dismutase ( MnSOD). As the mitochondrion plays a vital role in MnSOD activation , this study sought to determine the location and activity of MnSOD within BE cells after exposure to oxidative stress. A human BE cell line , BAR-T cell , was exposed 0.4 mM concentrations of taurocholic acid ( Tau) or a 0.4 mM 1:1 mixture of bile salts for 4 h. Cell viability was performed with 3- ( 4 , 5-dimthyl-thiazol-2-yl) -2 , 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. Proteins were extracted and separated into mitochondrial , nuclear , and cytoplasmic fractions followed by analysis by a western blot and enzymatic activities. BAR-T cell showed resistance to the bile-salt insults. Expression of MnSOD was significantly increased in the cells exposed to a mixture of bile acids and Tau versus control. Mitochondria MnSOD is abundant and highly active. Nuclear fraction displayed presence of both MnSOD and Cu/zinc superoxide dismutase secondary to bile-acid exposure; however , the MnSOD was inactive in nuclear fraction. This is the first study to specifically evaluate cellular fraction MnSOD expression , increased in BE cells in response to the oxidative stress of bile exposure. Mitochondrial MnSOD contributes to resistance of BAR-T cells to the bile-salt insults. Further investigation is required to determine the potential correlation between bile exposure and BE to adenocarcinoma progression via MnSOD-mediated cell signaling.
