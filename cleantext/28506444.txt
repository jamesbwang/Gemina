  During the last decade the field of cancer immunotherapy has witnessed impressive progress. Highly effective immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibition , and T-cell engaging therapies like bispecific T-cell engaging ( BiTE) single-chain antibody constructs and chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) T cells have shown remarkable efficacy in clinical trials and some of these agents have already received regulatory approval. However , along with growing experience in the clinical application of these potent immunotherapeutic agents comes the increasing awareness of their inherent and potentially fatal adverse effects , most notably the cytokine release syndrome<disease> ( CRS). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying CRS pathophysiology , risk factors , clinical presentation , differential diagnoses , and prognostic factors. In addition , based on the current evidence we give practical guidance to the management of the cytokine release
