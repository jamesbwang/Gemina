  We previously found that the fifth epidermal growth factor-like domain of thrombomodulin ( TME5) exerts cytoprotective and pro-angiogenic functions via G-protein coupled receptor 15 ( GPR15). TME5 is comprised of three S-S bonds that divide it into three loops: A ( TME5A) , B ( TME5B) , and C ( TME5C). Here , we identified the minimum structure of TME5 that produces favorable effects in vascular endothelial cells ( ECs). We found that TME5C , composed of 19 amino acids , but not TME5A or TME5B , stimulated the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) and human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells ( HHSECs). Matrigel plug assays showed that TME5C stimulates in vivo angiogenesis. In addition , TME5C counteracted calcineurin inhibitor-induced apoptosis and vascular permeability in HUVECs and HHSECs. Western blot analysis indicated that exposure of either HUVECs or HHSECs to TME5C increased the levels of anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia-1 protein in association with the activation of signal transduction pathways , including extracellular signal-regulated kinase , AKT , and mitogen-activated protein kinase p38. Importantly , TME5C did not affect the coagulation pathway in vitro. The cytoprotective function of TME5C was mediated by cell surface-expressed GPR15 , as TME5C was not able to protect vascular ECs isolated from GPR15 knock-out mice. Strikingly , TME5C successfully ameliorated sinusoidal obstruction syndrome<disease> in a murine model by counteracting the reduction of sinusoidal ECs numbers. Taken together , the cytoprotective and pro-angiogenetic functions of TM are preserved in TME5C. Use of TME5C may be a promising treatment strategy to prevent or treat lethal complications such as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome<disease> whose pathogenesis is based on endothelial insults.
