  A highly π-acidic dipyridinium-naphthalene diimide acceptor shows anion-π interactions with halides and PF6-. Lewis basicity and redox potential of the anion affect the chemistry , and photophysical and electrochemical properties , as well as both ionic and electrical conductivities. Our results provide insights into doping , degradation and ion transport mechanisms in organic n-type semiconductors.
