  In this study , a computer-based network pharmacology approach was applied to investigate the potential mechanism and important components of Rhodiola crenulata in the protection of H9c2 cells against hydrogen peroxide ( H ₂ O ₂)- induced oxidative stress. The intestinal absorption liquid of R. crenulata enhanced the cell viability , maintained cell morphology and inhibited cell apoptosis in the H ₂ O ₂- induced oxidative stress in H9c2. Then , computer-based network pharmacology was used to analyze the relevant mechanism. A total of 133 oxidative stress-related compounds were screened out; and 26 of them occupied the top 20 % , and all of the compounds enriched in 43 oxidative stress-related key targets. Finally , a `` compound-target-pathway-function '' network was constructed. Based on the analysis of the network pharmacology , R. crenulata protected H9c2 cells against H ₂ O ₂- induced oxidative stress probably by affecting apoptosis-related processes , such as cell death , nitric oxide metabolism , oxidative stress , mitochondrial mechanism , redox process , redox-related enzyme activty and other oxidative stress-related process. And salidroside , ethyl gallate and catechins , which were the main components of R. crenulata , played an important role in this process. Therefore , the potential mechanism and important components of R. crenulata revealed the protective effect on oxidative stress. This study shows a multi-component , multi-target and overall regulation effect of R. crenulata on the oxidative stress , and provides a reliable reference for subsequent systematic experimental studies for the pharmacodynamic material foundation and mechanism of action R. crenulata.
