  Mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs) are considered to be an excellent source in regenerative medicine. They contain several cell subtypes , including multipotent stem cells. MSCs are of particular interest as they are currently being tested using cell and gene therapies for a number of human<disease> diseases<disease>. They represent a rare population in tissues; for this reason , they require , before being transplanted , an in vitro amplification. This process may induce replicative senescence , thus affecting differentiation and proliferative capacities. Increasing evidence suggests that MSCs from fetal tissues are significantly more plastic and grow faster than MSCs from bone<disease> marrow. Here , we compare amniotic fluid mesenchymal stromal cells ( AF-MSCs) and bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stromal cells ( BM-MSCs) in terms of cell proliferation , surface markers , multidifferentiation potential , senescence , and DNA repair capacity. Our study shows that AF-MSCs are less prone to senescence with respect to BM-MSCs. Moreover , both cell models activate the same repair system after DNA damage , but AF-MSCs are able to return to the basal condition more efficiently with respect to BM-MSCs. Indeed , AF-MSCs are better able to cope with genotoxic stress that may occur either during in vitro cultivation or following transplantation in patients. Our findings suggest that AF-MSCs may represent a valid alternative to BM-MSCs in regenerative medicine , and , of great relevance , the investigation of the mechanisms involved in DNA repair capacity of both AF-MSCs and BM-MSCs may pave the way to their rational use in the medical field.
