  Female sex pheromone of a clearwing moth Nokona feralis ( Leech) ( Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) , a pest of kiwifruit , was identified to be a 7:3 mixture of ( 3E ,13 Z) -3,13-octadecadienyl acetate ( E3,Z13-18: OAc) and ( 3E ,13 Z) -3,13-octadecadien-1-ol ( E3,Z13-18: OH) by GC-EAD and GC/MS analyses. Males were attracted to wide-range mixtures of E3,Z13-18: OAc and E3,Z13-18: OH , and a 7:3 mixture of those two compounds strongly attracted the males in the field.
