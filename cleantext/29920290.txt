  Multiple sclerosis ( MS) is an autoimmune disease in which pathogenic T cells play an important role , and an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis<disease> ( EAE) is used as an animal model of MS. Galectins are β-galactoside-binding lectins and involved in various physiological and pathological events. Among fifteen members of galectins , galectin-1 , -8 , and -9 play immunosuppressive roles in MS and EAE; however , the role of galectin-3 ( gal-3) is complex and controversial. We examined expression of gal-3 in the spinal cord and nerve roots of EAE mice. No immunohistochemical signals were detected in naïve mice , whereas gal-3 appeared at lower lumbar levels of the spinal cord and nerve roots in EAE mice. In the spinal cord , gal-3-positive cells were activated microglia and/or infiltrating macrophages , which were round in shape and intensified for the lysosomal enzyme , cathepsin D , indicating elevated phagocytic activity. Gal-3-positive cells in the spinal cord were most abundant during the peak symptomatic period. In the recovery period , they disappeared from the spinal parenchyma but remained at moderate levels in the pia mater. Interestingly , gal-3-positive cells selectively appeared in ventral , but not dorsal , nerve roots running through the spinal canal , with expression peaking during the recovery period. In ventral nerve roots , the major cell type expressing gal-3 was a specific population of Schwann cells that surround unmyelinated axons and express the biosynthetic enzyme for l-serine , a potent neurotrophic amino acid. Gal-3 was also induced in Iba1/F4/80-positive macrophages , which engulf damaged myelin and axon debris. Thus , gal-3 is induced in distinct cell types that are engaged in removal of damaged axons and cell debris and axon regeneration and remyelination , suggesting a potential neuroprotective role of gal-3 in EAE mice.
