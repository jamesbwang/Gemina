  In addition to traditional drugs , such as enzyme inhibitors , receptor agonists/antagonists , and protein-protein interaction inhibitors as well as genetic technology , such as RNA interference and the CRISPR/Cas9 system , protein knockdown approaches using proteolysis-targeting chimeras ( PROTACs) have attracted much attention. PROTACs , which induce selective degradation of their target protein via the ubiquitin-proteasome system , are useful for the down-regulation of various proteins , including disease-related proteins and epigenetic proteins. Recent reports have shown that chemical protein knockdown is possible not only in cells , but also in vivo and this approach is expected to be used as the therapeutic strategy for several diseases. Thus , this approach may be a significant technique to complement traditional drugs and genetic ablation and will be more widely used for drug discovery and chemical biology studies in the future. In this personal account , a history of chemical protein knockdown is introduced , and its features , recent progress in the epigenetics field , and future outlooks are discussed.
