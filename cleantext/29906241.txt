  Trigger factor ( TF) is a key component of the prokaryotic chaperone network , which is involved in many basic cellular processes , such as protein folding , protein trafficking , and ribosome assembly. The major chaperone site of TF has a cradle-like structure in which protein substrate may fold without interference from other proteins. Here , we investigated in vivo and in vitro the roles of hydrophobic and charged patches on the edge and interior of cradle during TF-assisted protein folding. Our results showed that most of the surface of the cradle was involved in TF-assisted protein folding , which was larger than found in early studies. Although the inner surface of cradle was mostly hydrophobic , both hydrophobic and electrostatic patches were indispensable for TF to facilitate correct protein folding. However , hydrophobic patches were more important for the antiaggregation activity of TF. Furthermore , it was found that the patches on the surface of cradle were involved in TF-assisted protein folding in a spatial and temporal order. These results suggest that the folding-favorable interface between the cradle and substrate was dynamic during TF-assisted protein folding , which enabled TF to be involved in the folding of substrate in an aggressive manner rather than acting as a classic holdase.-Fan , D. , Cao , S. , Zhou , Q. , Zhang , Y. , Yue , L. , Han , C. , Yang , B. , Wang , Y. , Ma , Z. , Zhu , L. , Liu , C.
