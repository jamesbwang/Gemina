  Tantalum ( Ta)- coated porous Ti-6A1-4V scaffolds have better bioactivity than Ti-6A1-4V scaffolds; however , their bioperformance as an artificial vertebral body ( AVB) is unknown. In the present study , we combined a Ta-coated Ti-6A1-4V scaffold with rabbit bone<disease> marrow stromal cells ( BMSCs) for tissue-engineered AVB ( TEAVB) construction and evaluated the healing and fusion efficacy of this scaffold in lumbar vertebral defects after corpectomy in rabbits. The results showed that BMSCs on the surface of the Ta-coated Ti scaffolds proliferated better than BMSCs on Ti scaffolds. Histomorphometry showed better bone formation when using Ta-coated TEAVBs than that with Ti TEAVBs at both 8 and 12 weeks after implantation. In addition , the vertical and rotational stiffness results showed that , compared with uncoated TEAVBs , Ta-coated TEAVBs enhanced rabbit lumbar vertebral defect repair. Our findings demonstrate that Ta-coated TEAVBs have better healing and fusion efficacy than Ti TEAVBs in rabbit lumbar vertebral defects , which indicates their good prospects for clinical application.
