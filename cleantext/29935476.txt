  The accuracy of protein synthesis is provided by the editing functions of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases ( aaRSs) , a mechanism that eliminates misactivated amino acids or mischarged tRNAs. Despite research efforts , some molecular bases of these mechanisms are still unclear. The post-transfer editing pathway of leucyl-tRNA synthetase ( LeuRS) carried out in a special insertion domain ( the Connective Polypeptide 1 or CP1) , as editing domain. Recently , it was shown by in vivo studies and was supported by mutagenesis , and the kinetics approaches that the CP1 domain of LeuRS has discriminatory power for different substrates. The goal of this work is to investigate the structural basis for amino acid recognition of LeuRS post-transfer editing processes with molecular dynamics ( MD) simulation method. To pursue this aim , the molecular modeling studies on Thermus thermophiles LeuRS ( LeuRSTT) with two post-transfer substrates ( norvalyl-tRNA
