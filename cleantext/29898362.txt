  We report the use of 2,6-dimethylphenyl isocyanide ( 2,6-DMPI) as a spectroscopic probe to study the heterogeneous nucleation and deposition of Pd on Ag nanocubes under different conditions by surface-enhanced Raman scattering. As a major advantage , the spectroscopic analysis can be performed in situ and in real time with the nanoparticles still suspended in the reaction solution. The success of this method relies on the distinctive stretching frequencies ( Î½
