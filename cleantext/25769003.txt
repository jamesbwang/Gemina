  Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH) is a genetic disease associated with persistently elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) , which ultimately leads to greatly increased rates of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerosis progression can be clinically approximated through measurement of coronary artery calcification ( CAC). CAC can be measured via electron beam computed tomography ( EBCT) , multi-slice computed tomography ( MSCT) , or contrast-enhanced CT coronary angiography ( CTCA). Here , we present the case of a 72-year-old man with known FH and established hypercholesterolemia who has consistently tested negative for any significant CAC.
