  As endoscopic instrumentation , techniques and knowledges have significantly improved recently , endoscopic ear surgery has become increasingly popular. Transcanal endoscopic ear surgery ( TEES) can provide better visualization of hidden areas in the middle ear cavity during congenital cholesteatoma removal. We aimed to describe outcomes for TEES for congenital cholesteatoma in a pediatric population. Twenty-five children ( age , 17 months to 9 years) with congenital cholesteatoma confined to the middle ear underwent TEES by an experienced surgeon; 13 children had been classified as Potsic stage I , seven as stage II , and five as stage III. The mean follow-up period was 24 months. Recurrence of congenital cholesteatoma and surgical complication was observed. Congenital cholesteatoma can be removed successfully via transcanal endoscopic approach in all patients , and no surgical complications occurred; only one patient with a stage II cholesteatoma showed recurrence during the follow-up visit , and the patient underwent revision surgery. The other patients underwent one-stage operations and showed no cholesteatoma recurrence at their last visits. Two patients underwent second-stage ossicular reconstruction. Although the follow-up period and number of patients were limited , pediatric congenital cholesteatoma limited to the middle ear cavity could be safely and effectively removed using TEES.
