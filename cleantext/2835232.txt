  The papillomavirus<pathogen> ( PV) protein E2 is one of only two proteins required for viral DNA replication. E2 is the viral transcriptional regulator/activation protein as well as the initiator of viral DNA replication. E2 is known to interact with various cellular DNA replication proteins , including the PV E1 protein , the cellular ssDNA<pathogen> binding complex ( RPA) , and topoisomerase I. Recently , we observed that cellular DNA polymerase & epsilon; ( pol & epsilon ;-RRB- interacts with the PV helicase protein , E1. E1 stimulates its activity with a very high degree of specificity , implicating pol & epsilon; in PV DNA replication. In this paper , we evaluated whether E2 also shows a functional interaction with pol & epsilon;. We found that E2 stimulates the DNA synthesis activity of pol & epsilon; , independently of pol & epsilon; & rsquo; s processivity factors , RFC , PCNA , and RPA , or E1. This appears to be specific for pol & epsilon; , as cellular DNA polymerase & delta; is unaffected by E1. However , unlike other known stimulatory factors of pol & epsilon; , E2 does not affect the processivity of pol & epsilon;. The domains of E2 were analyzed individually and in combination for their ability to stimulate pol & epsilon;. Both the transactivation and hinge domains were found to be important for this stimulation , while the E2 DNA-binding domain was dispensable. These findings support a role for E2 beyond E1 recruitment in viral DNA replication , demonstrate a novel functional interaction in PV DNA replication , and further implicate cellular pol & epsilon; in PV DNA replication.
