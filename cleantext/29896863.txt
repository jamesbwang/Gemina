  The interaction of PEGylated poly ( amino acid) s with their biological targets depends on their chemical nature and spatial arrangement of their building blocks. The synthesis , self-assembly , and DNA complexation of ABC terblock copolymers consisting of poly ( ethylene glycol) , ( PEG) , poly ( l-lysine) , and poly ( l-leucine) , are reported. Block copolymers are produced by a metal-free , living ring-opening polymerization of respective amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides using amino-terminated PEG as macroinitiator: ( PEG-b-p ( l-Lys)
