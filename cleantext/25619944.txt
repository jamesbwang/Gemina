  We present a theoretical approach to control bovine brucellosis<disease> We have used individual-based modelling , which is a network-type alternative to compartmental models. Our model thus considers heterogeneous populations , and spatial aspects such as migration among herds and control actions described as pulse interventions are also easily implemented. We show that individual-based modelling reproduces the mean field behaviour of an equivalent compartmental model. Details of this process , as well as flowcharts , are provided to facilitate the reproduction of the presented results. We further investigate three numerical examples using real parameters of herds in the SÃ£o Paulo state of Brazil , in scenarios which explore eradication , continuous and pulsed vaccination and meta-population effects. The obtained results are in good agreement with the expected behaviour of this disease , which ultimately showcases the effectiveness of our theory.
