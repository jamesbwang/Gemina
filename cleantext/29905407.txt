  The extracellular actin scavenging system ( EASS) is composed of plasma Gc-globulin and gelsolin , and is responsible for the elimination of toxic actin from the bloodstream. In this study , we assessed the actin-free Gc-globulin concentrations in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) obtained from subjects with neurodegenerative and inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> of the central nervous system ( CNS) as well as in a control group. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) , we measured the actinfree Gc-globulin concentrations in blood plasma and CSF obtained from subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) ( n = 20) , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) ( n = 12) , multiple sclerosis ( MS) ( n = 42) , tick-borne<disease> encephalitis<disease> ( TBE) ( n = 12) , and from a control group ( n = 20). The concentrations of free Gc-globulin in plasma collected from patients diagnosed with AD ( 509.6 ± 87.6 mg/L) and ALS ( 455.5 ± 99.8 mg/L) did not differ significantly between each other , but were significantly higher compared to the reference group ( 311.7 ± 87.5 mg/L) ( p < 0.001 and p < 0.006 , respectively) as well as to MS ( 310.8 ± 66.6 mg/L) ( p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 , respectively) and TBE ( 256.7 ± 76 mg/L) ( p < 0.001 and p < 0.003 , respectively). In CSF collected from patients diagnosed with AD and ALS , the concentrations of free Gc-globulin were 2.6 ± 1.1 mg/L and 2.7 ± 1.9 mg/L , respectively. They did not differ significantly between each other and were significantly higher compared to the reference group ( 1.5 ± 0.9 mg/L) ( p < 0.005 and p < 0.041 , respectively). Interestingly , in patients with AD , significantly higher values of Gcglobulin were detected compared to multiple sclerosis patients ( 1.7 ± 0.9 mg/L) ( p < 0.013). Higher concentrations of free Gc-globulin in blood plasma and CSF collected from patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases may indicate a potential role of this protein in their pathogenesis , and represent a potential tool for the diagnosis of CNS diseases.
