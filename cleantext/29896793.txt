  To examine whether timely outpatient follow-up after hospital discharge reduces the risk of subsequent rehospitalization among people experiencing homelessness and mental illness. Comprehensive linked administrative data including hospital admissions , laboratory services , and community medical services. Participants were recruited to the Vancouver At Home study based on a-priori criteria for homelessness and mental illness ( n = 497). Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between outpatient care within 7 days postdischarge and subsequent rehospitalization over a 1-year period. Data were extracted for a consenting subsample of participants ( n = 433) spanning 5 years prior to study enrollment. More than half of the eligible sample ( 53 percent; n = 128) were rehospitalized within 1 year following an index hospital discharge. Neither outpatient medical services nor laboratory services within 7 days following discharge were associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of rehospitalization within 2 months ( AOR = 1.17 ( CI = 0.94 , 1.46)) , 6 months ( AOR = 1.00 ( CI = 0.82 , 1.23)) or 12 months ( AOR = 1.24 ( CI = 1.02 , 1.52)). In contrast to evidence from nonhomeless samples , we found no association between timely outpatient follow-up and the likelihood of rehospitalization in our homeless , mentally ill cohort. Our findings indicate a need to address housing as an essential component of discharge planning alongside outpatient care.
