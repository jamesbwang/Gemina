  Melanins are enigmatic biological macromolecules that can be produced by plants , animals and microorganisms and are especially suited for production in fermentation broth , which is prone to industrialization and few inputs. This research was conducted to purify , characterize and determine the biological activity of extracellular melanin extracted from Streptomyces<pathogen> sp.. The extracellular melanin ( M) was extracted from Streptomyces<pathogen> sp. with a yield of 1.46 g/L. Ma , Mb , Mc and Md were fractionated from M using a Sephadex G-50 column. Ma was detected as the homogeneous component. After studying its ultraviolet-visible absorbance , infrared , and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra as well as the scanning electron microscopy images , Ma was confirmed to be typical melanin. Based on its elemental analysis , Ma consisted of C , H , N , O , and S , the percentages of which suggesting that phaeomelanin was the main component. In addition , Ma showed significant anti-radiation and free radical scavenging activity. Thus , these results indicated that Streptomyces<pathogen> sp. could be a new source to obtain melanin. Ma might be a potential antioxidant and ultraviolet protector and could be used in cosmetics , pesticides , food and other industries.
