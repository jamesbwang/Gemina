  Heart disease is the leading cause of hospitalization and death worldwide , severely affecting health care costs. Aging is a significant risk factor for heart disease and the senescent heart is characterized by structural and functional changes including diastolic and systolic dysfunction as well as left ventricular ( LV) dyssynchrony. Speckle-tracking based strain echocardiography ( STE) has been shown as a non-invasive , reproducible and highly sensitive methodology to evaluate LV function in both animal models and humans. Herein , we describe the efficiency of this technique as a comprehensive and sensitive method for the detection of age-related cardiac dysfunction in mice. Compared to conventional echocardiographic measurements , radial and longitudinal strain , and reverse longitudinal strain were able to detect subtle changes in systolic and diastolic cardiac function in mice at an earlier time-point during aging. Additionally , the data show a gradual and consistent decrease with age in regional contractility throughout the entire LV , in both radial and longitudinal axes. Furthermore , we observed that LV segmental dyssynchrony in longitudinal axis reliably differentiated between aged and young mice. Therefore , we propose the use of echocardiographic strain as a highly sensitive and accurate technology enabling the evaluating the effect of new treatments to fight age-induced cardiac disease.
