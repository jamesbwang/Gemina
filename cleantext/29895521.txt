  The results of a study to determine the physical compatibility of plazomicin sulfate solution during simulated Y-site administration with 92 i.v. drugs are reported. Plazomicin injection solution ( 500 mg/10 mL) was diluted in 0.9 % sodium chloride or 5 % dextrose for injection to a final volume of 50 mL ( final plazomicin concentration , 24 mg/mL) , consistent with a 15-mg/kg dose administered to an 80-kg patient ( i.e. , 1,200 mg). All other i.v. drugs were reconstituted according to manufacturers ' recommendations and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride or 5 % dextrose for injection to the upper range of concentrations used clinically. Y-site conditions were simulated by mixing 5 mL of plazomicin solution with 5 mL of tested drug solutions in a 1:1 ratio. Solutions were assessed for visual ( via color and Tyndall beam testing) , turbidity ( using a laboratory-grade turbidimeter) , and pH changes over a 60-minute observation period. Incompatibility was defined a priori as precipitation , color<symptom> change<symptom> , a positive Tyndall test , or a turbidity change of â‰¥ 0.5 nephelometric turbidity units at any time during the 60-minute observation period. Plazomicin was physically compatible with 79 of the 92 drugs tested. Determinations of physical incompatibility with plazomicin were made for 13 drugs: albumin , amiodarone , amphotericin B deoxycholate , anidulafungin , calcium chloride , daptomycin , esomeprazole , heparin , levofloxacin , methylprednisolone , micafungin , phenytoin , and propofol , CONCLUSION: Plazomicin at a concentration of 24 mg/mL was physically compatible with 85 % of the drugs tested , including 31 of 36 antimicrobial agents.
