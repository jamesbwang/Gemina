  The ubiquitous presence of brominated flame retardants ( BFRs) in indoor air , dust , and even in human tissue could be attributed to their emissions from BFR-containing products. Nevertheless , the emission behavior of BFRs , especially novel BFRs from consumer materials , to the indoor environment has still not been well understood. To evaluate the effects of chemical content , temperature , and time on the emissions of BFRs , we used a batch of small glass chambers to conduct emission tests on carpet , computer casings , sound insulation , circuit boards , decorative laminate , and PVC floors at temperatures from 20 to 80 °C , as well as different emission times of up to 35 days. Seven BFRs were extracted from the tested materials with contents ranging from 50 to 35,803 μg g
