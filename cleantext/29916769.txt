  Symptom recognition and self-management is instrumental in reducing the number of deaths related to coronary artery disease ( CAD) in women. The purpose of this study was to synthesize qualitative research evidence on the self-management of cardiac pain and associated symptoms in women. Seven databases were systematically searched , and the concepts of the Individual and Family Self-Management Theory were used as the framework for data extraction and analysis. Search strategies yielded 22,402 citations , from which 35 qualitative studies were included in a final meta-summary , comprising data from 769 participants , including 437 ( 57 %) women. The available literature focused cardiac pain self-management from a binary sex and gender perspective. Ethnicity was indicated in 19 ( 54 %) studies. Results support individualized intervention strategies that promote goal setting and action planning , management of physical and emotional responses , and social facilitation provided through social support.
