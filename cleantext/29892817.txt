  Integrin αvβ3 is one of the 24 heterodimeric structural proteins of the plasma membrane of animal cells. The extracellular domain of αvβ3 comprises about 80 % of its mass and is devoted largely to interactions with extracellular matrix ( ECM) proteins , such as vitronectin and fibronectin , and cell-cell interaction. The binding of specific ECM proteins is conveyed to the cell interior by signal transduction. In the past decade , integrin αvβ3 has been shown to bind small molecules , such as nonprotein hormones-thyroid hormone analogues and dihydrotestosterone-and the stilbene , resveratrol. The αvβ3-thyroid hormone interaction signal generated at the integrin is transduced into intracellular protein trafficking , nucleoprotein phosphorylation , and expression of specific genes. The hormone receptor on the integrin bears no structural homologies with nuclear thyroid hormone receptors ( TRs). Because integrin αvβ3 is generously expressed on the surface of cancer cells and rapidly dividing endothelial cells , thyroid hormone actions initiated at the receptor on integrin not unexpectedly relate to cell proliferation , cancer cell survival pathways and to angiogenesis. In this chapter , we present methods for the definition of the receptor , for monitoring certain of its functions and for the downregulation of the gene for the integrin.
