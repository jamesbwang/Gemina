  Cryo-electron microscopy ( Cryo-EM) imaging has the unique potential to bridge the gap between cellular and molecular biology by revealing the structures of large macromolecular assemblies and cellular complexes. Therefore , cryo-EM three-dimensional ( 3D) reconstruction has been rapidly developed in recent several years and applied widely in life science research; however , it suffers from reduced contrast and low signal-to-noise ratios with a high degree of noise under low electron dose conditions , resulting in failures of many conventional filters. In this article , we explored a modified wavelet shrinkage filter ( with optimal wavelet parameters: three-level decomposition , level-1 zeroed out , subband-dependent threshold , soft thresholding , and spline-based discrete dyadic wavelet transform) and extended its application in the cryo-EM field in two aspects: single-particle analysis and cryo-electron tomography. Its performance was assessed with simulation data and real cryo-EM experimental data. Compared with the undenoised results and conventional denoising techniques ( e.g. , Gaussian , median , and bilateral filters) , the modified wavelet shrinkage filter maintained the resolution and contrast but reduced the noise , leading to higher quality images and more accurate measures of the biological structure. We expect that our study can provide benefits to cryo-EM applications: 3D reconstruction , visualization , structural analysis , and interpretation. All these data and programs are available.
