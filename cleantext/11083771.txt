  Extracellular vesicles ( EVs) are small lipid vesicles released by prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells containing nucleic acids , proteins , and small metabolites essential for cellular communication. Depending on the targeted cell , EVs can act either locally or in distant tissues in a paracrine or endocrine cell signaling manner. Released EVs from virus-infected cells , bacteria , fungi<pathogen> , or parasites have been demonstrated to perform a pivotal role in a myriad of biochemical changes occurring in the host and pathogen , including the modulation the immune system. In the past few years , the biology of
