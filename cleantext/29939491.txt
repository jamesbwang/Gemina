  The nest environment for eggs of reptiles has lifelong implications for offspring performance and success , and , ultimately , for population viability and species distributions. However , understanding the various abiotic and biotic drivers of nesting is complex , particularly regarding variation in nesting behavior of females and consequences for sex ratios in species with temperature-dependent sex determination ( TSD). We investigated how nest construction and nesting phenology affect the incubation environment of a reptile with TSD , the tuatara ( Sphenodon punctatus) , a species that is at risk from climate-mediated male bias in population sex ratios. Using longitudinal behavioral data , we addressed the following questions. ( 1) Does nesting behavior vary with seasonal or location cues? ( 2) Does variation in nesting phenology or nest construction affect the incubation environment? We aimed to investigate whether female tuatara could modify nesting behavior to respond to novel environments , including a warming climate , allowing for successful incubation and balanced population sex ratios , maintaining population viability throughout their historic range. We predicted that earlier nesting after warm winters increased the likelihood that females will be produced , despite the sex determining system where males are produced from warmer temperatures. Further research is needed to understand the extent to which nesting behavior varies by individual through time , and across the range of tuatara , and the importance of habitat variability in maintaining production of females under future climate warming.
