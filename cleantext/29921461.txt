  Three aspects of the RayPilot real-time tracking system were investigated: ( 1) feasibility of the transmitter with respect to implantation and explantation procedures , ( 2) user and patients ' experiences and ( 3) quantification of the transmitter positional stability in relation to fiducial markers. Ten prostate cancer patients scheduled for radiotherapy received transmitter implantation in the prostate , concomitantly with fiducial markers. Transmitter and marker positions were assessed in 3D by orthogonal kV-imaging at daily treatment setup in eight patients. The transmitter was successfully implanted in all patients. Patients reported mild to moderate<symptom> discomfort<symptom> and impact on daily activities due to the implant but overall subjective tolerability was good. One patient had spontaneous explantation of the transmitter after four fractions. One patient had transmitter 3D shifts > 9 mm , but also inter-marker shifts > 6 mm. The mean inter-marker shift in the remaining patients was < 1 mm. In four patients , maximum transmitter 3D shifts were 5-7 mm ( mean > 2 mm). In three patients , mean transmitter 3D shifts were < 2 mm. Implantation and explantation of the transmitter is generally feasible and safe. Patient tolerability is good overall. However , due to interfractional transmitter positional instability in this cohort , use of the system for real-time tracking should be combined with other daily setup techniques.
