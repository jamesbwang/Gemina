  In the RV144 trial , HIV-1 gp120 V1V2 antibodies correlated inversely with risk of HIV-1 infection; however the titers waned quickly. We hypothesized that a more potent adjuvant might enhance the magnitude and durability of V1V2 antibodies. We examined archived sera from a phase I randomized , double blind placebo-controlled trial , conducted in HIV-1 uninfected individuals , vaccinated with HIV-1SF-2 rgp120 either adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide ( aluminum hydroxide arm) or encapsulated in liposomes containing monophosphoryl lipid A ( MPL ®) and then adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide ( liposomal arm). The median IgG antibody titers across weeks 10-112 were higher in the liposomal arm against subtypes B ( 2-16-fold) , AE ( 4-8-fold) and C ( 4-16-fold) V1V2 proteins. High titers were maintained even at 10 months post last boost in the liposomal compared to the aluminum hydroxide arm. The antibodies exhibited ADCC and 47-integrin receptor inhibition-binding functions. Inclusion of two adjuvants in the vaccine formulation , aluminum hydroxide and liposomal MPL ® , induced robust , durable , and functional antibodies. Based on the magnitude of antibody responses and the percentage of coiled and- sheet in the predicted V2/V3-peptide structure , we speculate that liposomal gp120 was presented in a conformation that favored the induction of robust antibody responses.
