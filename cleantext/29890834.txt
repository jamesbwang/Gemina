  Graphene is a promising two-dimensional nanomaterial for many applications due to its exciting properties. In the past decade , a variety of techniques-each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages-have been developed to prepare graphene , and there are ongoing efforts to improve these techniques and to reveal new approaches. Here , we describe a simple and low-cost process for the bottom-up synthesis of graphene-like films. This new methodology involves a two-step procedure: ( i) formation of polyaromatic ring structures by the repeated covalent coupling of aryl radicals generated from electrochemical reduction of polyhalogenated aromatic compounds in aprotic solvent , and ( ii) production of carbon networks by heating of polyaromatic surface films. Accordingly , polymeric films were prepared on the electrodes by electrochemical reduction of polyhalogenated compounds such as hexafluorobenzene ( HFB) , hexachlorobenzene ( HCB) , and hexabromobenzene ( HBB) , and then polymer films were annealed at 400 Â°C for 30 min. The structure and surface characteristics of electrodeposited carbon films under self- and thermal-annealing conditions were studied by spectroscopic and morphological techniques. Also , the capacitance performance of the films was evaluated by means of cyclic voltammetry , galvanostatic charge-discharge , and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results indicate that graphene-like carbon films can be achieved by use of the electrochemical approach under mild conditions without expensive equipment , and also that these carbon materials are very promising for low-cost energy-storage devices.
