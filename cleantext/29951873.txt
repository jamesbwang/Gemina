  In the present study , we aimed to explore the time course pathological changes after burn injury. The time course microarray data of burn injury from the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO) was further analyzed through bioinformatics analysis. The differential expression genes ( DEGs) were identified in the early-stage vs. control groups , middle-stage vs. control groups , and early-stage vs. middle-stage groups after burn injury , followed by pathway enrichment analysis. Gene modules associated with burn injury progression were identified through weighted gene co-expression network analysis ( WGCNA) , and hub genes were identified via network topology analysis. There were a total of 745 DEGs in the early vs. control group , 1104 DEGs in mid vs. control , and 61 DEGs in early vs. mid group. The significant pathways enriched by DEGs in the middle stage were also enriched by DEGs in the early stage. Immunodeficiency was a significant pathway specific for the DEGs in the early stage. There were 19 overlapped genes , such as myeloperoxidase , transcobalamin , and interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 , among DEGs in early vs. control , middle vs. control , and early vs. middle groups. WGCNA identified three gene modules that were significantly associated with burn injury progression. Furthermore , we identified several gene modules and biological processes that might be associated with burn injury progression , and such results may be beneficial in understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing novel drugs.
