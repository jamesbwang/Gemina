  Whilst the role of the Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 ( DISC1) gene in the aetiology of major mental illnesses is debated , the characterisation of its function lends it credibility as a candidate. A key aspect of this functional characterisation is the determination of the role of common non-synonymous polymorphisms on normal variation within these functions. The common allele ( A) of the DISC1 SNP rs821616 encodes a serine at the Ser704Cys polymorphism , and has been shown to increase the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein Kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1/2) which stimulate the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase , the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis. We therefore set out to test the hypothesis that human serine ( A) homozygotes would show elevated dopamine synthesis capacity compared to cysteine homozygotes and heterozygotes ( TT and AT) for rs821616. ( 18F)- DOPA PET was used to index striatal dopamine synthesis capacity as the influx rate constant Kicer in healthy volunteers DISC1 rs821616 serine homozygotes ( N = 46) and healthy volunteers DISC1 rs821616 cysteine homozygotes and heterozygotes ( N = 56) , matched for age , gender , ethnicity and using three scanners. We found DISC1 rs821616 serine homozygotes exhibited a significantly higher striatal Kicer compared to cysteine homozygotes and heterozygotes ( p = 0.012) explaining 6.4 % of the variance ( partial eta squared = 0.064). Our finding is consistent with its previous association with heightened activation of ERK1/2 , which stimulates tyrosine hydroxylase activity for dopamine synthesis. This could be a potential mechanism mediating risk for psychosis , lending further credibility to the fact that DISC1 is of functional interest in the aetiology of major mental illness.
