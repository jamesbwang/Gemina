  Recently , 34 genes had been associated with differential expression relative to blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP)/ hypertension ( HTN). We hypothesize that some of the genes associated with BP/HTN are also associated with BP response to antihypertensive treatment with thiazide diuretics. We assessed these 34 genes for association with differential expression to BP response to thiazide diuretics with RNA sequencing in whole blood samples from 150 hypertensive participants from the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses ( PEAR) and PEAR-2 studies. PEAR white and PEAR-2 white and black participants ( n = 50 for each group) were selected based on the upper and lower quartile of BP response to hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ) and to chlorthalidone. FOS , DUSP1 and PPP1R15A were differentially expressed across all cohorts ( meta-analysis p-value < 2.0 Ã— 10 These findings suggest FOS , DUSP1 and PPP1R15A as potential molecular determinants of antihypertensive response to thiazide diuretics.
