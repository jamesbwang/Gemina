  The effects of resistant starch ( RS) on serum cholesterol levels have been previously investigated. However , the results of those studies are inconsistent. The purpose of our meta-analysis was to determine if RS affects blood lipids based on the current literature. The methods included searching databases ( PubMed , Embase , Scopus , and Cochrane Library) up to September 2017 , as well as hand-searching reference lists of articles published in English. The initial search yielded 1228 articles. Of these , 14 articles ( 20 trials) were included in our investigation focusing on the effects of RS on total cholesterol ( TC; 19 trials) , triglycerides ( TG; 19 trials) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C; 16 trials) , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( 17 trials). Methodological quality was assessed using TC , LDL-C , TGs , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Pooled effects were calculated using a random-effects model. The meta-analysis of these data showed that RS supplementation has an effect on lowering TC and LDL-C ( TC: mean difference , -7.33 mg/dL ( 95 % confidence interval -12.15 to -2.52 mg/dL); LDL-C: mean difference: -3.40 mg/dL ( 95 % confidence interval , -6.74 to -0.07 mg/dL)). Subgroup meta-analysis revealed that a longer time ( > 4weeks) of RS supplementation can generate more obvious effects on TC and LDL-C levels , and higher dose ( > 20 g/d) of RS also had a lowering effect on TG level. Future research should focus on the relationship between RS type and cholesterol-lowering effects , and the effects on subjects of different health status or those with different baseline levels of serum lipids. Moreover , the mechanism for the cholesterol-lowering effects of RS should be further explored. In conclusion , RS can reduce serum TC and LDL-C levels , particularly when administered for a duration longer than 4 weeks.
