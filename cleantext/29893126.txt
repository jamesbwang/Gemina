  The premature leakage of anticancer drugs during blood circulation may the damage immune system , normal cells , and tissues. Constructing targeted nanocarriers with pH , glutathione , and NIR triple-responsive property can effectively avoid the leakage of anticancer drugs before they arrive at the targeted site. In this paper , magnetic hollow porous carbon nanoparticles ( MHPCNs) were successfully fabricated as nanocarrier. Poly ( Î³-glutamic acid) was used to cap the pores of MHPCNs. The photothermal conversion property of carbon and iron oxide ( Fe
