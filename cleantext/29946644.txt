  To compare the clinical efficacy of CAD/CAM all-ceramic inlay and polymerid porcelain inlay in restoring Class II cavity of posterior teeth. Ninety-seven patients with 100 posterior teeth of ClassII cavity were recruited in this randomized control trial; Among them , 50 patients were grouped into CAD/CAM all-ceramic inlays and 47 patients were grouped into Ceramage polymerid porcelain inlay. According to the modified USPHS criteria , the incidence of postoperative sensitivity , prosthesis fracture , prosthesis falling off , and edge coloration were evaluated 12 months and 24 months after restoration. Chi-square test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used for statistical analysis using SPSS 13.0 software package. Restoration in the 2 groups were successful , there was no significant difference at 12 months ( P > 0.05). Postoperative sensitivity and the incidence of prosthesis falling off in both groups were not significantly different ( P > 0.05); however , the number of prosthesis fracture of the polymerid porcelain was lower than that of the CAD/CAM all-ceramic inlays ( P < 0.05). The incidence of edge coloration of CAD/CAM all-ceramic inlays was lower than that of the polymerid porcelain at 24-month follow-up ( P < 0.05). Restoration with polymerid porcelain is more likely to have a higher success rate than those with CAD/CAM all-ceramic inlays. Patients undergoing CAD/CAM all-ceramic inlays have a lower incidence of edge coloration , compared with those undergoing polymerid porcelain.
