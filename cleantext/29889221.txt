  The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides has sparked concern over the toxicity risk to honey bees ( Apis mellifera L. ( Hymenoptera: Apidae)). In this study , feeding treatments with the clothianidin formulation at 2.6 ppb ( residue concentration) or its binary mixtures with five representative pesticides ( classes) did not influence on adult survivorship , but all treatments caused significantly lower body<symptom> weight than controls. Most binary mixtures at residue levels showed minor or no interaction on body<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , and synergistic interaction was detected only from the mixture of clothianidin + λ-cyhalothrin. Chlorpyrifos alone and the mixture of clothianidin + chlorpyrifos significantly suppressed esterase ( EST) activity , while most treatments of individual pesticides and mixtures had no effect on EST and glutathione S-transferase ( GST) activities. However , ingestion of clothianidin at 2.6 ppb significantly enhanced P450 oxidase activity by 19 %. The LC50 of formulated clothianidin was estimated at 0.53 ppm active ingredient , which is equivalent to 25.4 ng clothianidin per bee ( LD50) based on the average sugar consumption of 24 µl per bee per day. In addition to mortality , ingestion of clothianidin at LC50 significantly reduced bee body<symptom> weight by 12 %. P450 activities were also significantly induced at 24 and 48 h in clothianidin-treated bees , while no significant difference was found in GST and EST activities. Further examinations revealed that the expression of an important CYP9q1 detoxification gene was significantly induced by clothianidin. Thus , data consistently indicated that P450s were involved in clothianidin detoxification in honey bees. Although the honey bee population in Stoneville ( MS , United States) had sixfold lower susceptibility than other reported populations , clothianidin had very high oral toxicity to bees.
