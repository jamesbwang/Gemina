  Solid-state synthesis ensures a high loading and well-dispersed growth of a large collection of metal-organic framework ( MOF) nanostructures within a series of commercially available mesoporous silica. This approach provides a general , highly efficient , scalable , environmentally friendly , and inexpensive strategy for shaping MOFs into a fluidized form , thereby allowing their application in fluidized-bed reactors for diverse applications , such as CO
