  Nano zero-valent iron ( nZVI) has great potential in the remediation of metal ( loid)- contaminated soils , but its efficiency in metal ( loid) stabilization in the plant-microbe continuum is unclear. This study investigated nZVI-mediated metal ( loid) behavior in the arbuscular mycorrhizal ( AM) fungal-maize ( Zea mays L.) plant association. Plants with AM fungal inoculation were grown in metal ( loid)- ( mainly Zn and Pb) contaminated soils ( Litavka River , Czech Republic) amended with/without 0.5 % ( w/w) nZVI. The results showed that nZVI decreased plant metal ( loid) uptake but inhibited AM development and its function in metal ( loid) stabilization in the rhizosphere. AM fungal inoculation alleviated the physiological stresses caused by nZVI and restrained nZVI efficiency in reducing plant metal ( loid) uptake. Micro proton-induced X-ray emission ( Î¼-PIXE) analysis revealed the sequestration of Zn ( possibly through binding to thiols) by fungal structures in the roots and the precipitation of Pb and Cu in the mycorrhizal root rhizodermis ( possibly by Fe compounds originated from nZVI). XRD analyses further indicated that Pb/Fe mineral transformations in the rhizosphere were influenced by AM and nZVI treatments. The study revealed the counteractive effects of AM and nZVI on plant metal ( loid) uptake and uncovered details of metal ( loid) behavior in the AM fungal-root-nZVI system , calling into question about nZVI implementation in mycorrhizospheric systems.
