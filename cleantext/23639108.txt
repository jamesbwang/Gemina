  The rapid development of CRISPR technology is revolutionizing molecular approaches to the dissection of complex biological phenomena. Here we describe an alternative generally applicable implementation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system that allows for selective knockdown of extremely homologous genes. This strategy employs the lentiviral delivery of paired sgRNAs and nickase Cas9 ( Cas9D10A) to achieve targeted deletion of splice junctions. This general strategy offers several advantages over standard single-guide exon-targeting CRISPR-Cas9 such as greatly reduced off-target effects , more restricted genomic editing , routine disruption of target gene mRNA expression and the ability to differentiate between closely related genes. Here we demonstrate the utility of this strategy by achieving selective knockdown of the highly homologous human genes FOXO3A and suspected pseudogene FOXO3B. We find the spJCRISPR strategy to efficiently and selectively disrupt FOXO3A and FOXO3B mRNA and protein expression; thus revealing that the human FOXO3B locus encodes a bona fide human gene. Unlike FOXO3A , we find the FOXO3B protein to be cytosolically localized in both the presence and absence of active Akt. The ability to selectively target and efficiently disrupt the expression of the closely-related FOXO3A and FOXO3B genes demonstrates the efficacy of the spJCRISPR approach.
