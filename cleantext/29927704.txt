  To evaluate the one-year immunogenicity and safety of a subunit plague vaccine. In the initial study , 240 healthy adults aged 18-55 years were administrated with 2 doses of 15 or 30 µg plague vaccines at day 0 and 28 , respectively. In this extended follow-up study , we evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of the plague vaccine up to one year. For antibody to envelope antigen faction 1 ( F1) antigen , titers were up to new peaks at month 6 , then declined slowly to month 12 , but remained at higher levels than those at day 56. Geometric mean titers ( GMTs) of F1 were significantly higher in 30 µg group than those in 15 µg group at month 6 and 12 ( P < 0.0001 and P < 0.001). However , approximate 100 % seroconversion rates of F1 antibodies were found in both 15 and 30 µg groups at the both time points. For antibody to recombinant virulence ( rV) antigen , titers and seroconversion rates were decreased sharply at month 6 and continue to decrease at month 12. GMTs and seroconversion rates were not significantly different between the 15 and 30 µg groups , respectively. No serious adverse events ( SAEs) related to vaccine occurred. The new plague vaccine ( F1 + rV) induced a robust immune response up to 12 months and showed a good safety profile in adults aged 18-55 years.
