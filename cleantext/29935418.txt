  This study investigated the role of chlorophyll and light in the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs) using disrupted cell aqueous extract of Neochloris oleoabundans. It was found that , while increasing sonication time increased the percentage of disrupted cells and efficiency of aqueous cell extraction , over-sonication reduced AgNPs production. AgNPs biosynthesis required illumination of white , blue , or purple light while AgNPs formation was undetectable under dark condition or illumination of orange or red light , indicating only photons of high energy levels among the photosynthetic active radiations are capable of exciting the electrons of chlorophylls to a state that is sufficient for Ag
