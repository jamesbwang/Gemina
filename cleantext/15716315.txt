  Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia<disease> ( LIP) is an uncommon interstitial lung disease that is characterized by an interstitial infiltrate of lymphoplasmacytic cells. While idiopathic LIP appears to be extremely rare , most reported cases of LIP have been associated with coexisting immune derangements , particularly autoimmune diseases such as Sj√∂gren 's syndrome<disease>. In this report , we describe the presentation of LIP in a patient with underlying mixed connective tissue disease.
