  Patients with both COPD and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) pose particularly high costs to the health-care system. These diseases arise from similar root causes , have overlapping symptoms , and share similar clinical courses. Because of these strong parallels , strategies to reduce readmissions in patients with both conditions share synergies. Here we present 10 practical tips to reduce readmissions in this challenging population: ( 1) diagnose the population accurately , ( 2) detect admissions for exacerbations early and consider risk stratification , ( 3) use specialist management in hospital , ( 4) modify the underlying disease substrate , ( 5) apply and intensify evidence-based therapies , ( 6) activate the patient and develop critical health behaviors , ( 7) setup feedback loops , ( 8) arrange an early follow-up appointment prior to discharge , ( 9) consider and address other comorbidities , and ( 10) consider ancillary support services at home. The multidisciplinary care teams needed to support these care models pose expense to the health-care system. Although these costs may more easily be recouped under financial models such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments , the opportunity cost of an admission for COPD or HF may represent an underrecognized financial lever.
