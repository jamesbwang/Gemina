  The prevalence of pathogen inhibitors bacteria has motivate the study for antimicrobial compounds. Bioactive fungicide have always received considerable attention. A bacterial isolated strain HAB-5 showed antifungal activity against plant fungi<pathogen> Based on morphological , physiological , biochemical and 16SrDNA sequence analysis , the strain was identified to be a Bacillus<pathogen> atrophaeus. This strain possessed a broad spectrum antifungal activity against various plant pathogenic fungi<pathogen> Extraction of antifungal substance was performed and the crude extract had potent antifungal ability and showed great potential for swelling and inhibiting spore germination. This antifungal displayed heat stability and active in a wide pH range 5.0-10.0. Moreover no reduction was found in its activity after enzyme treatment. The toxicity test was evaluated in Danio<pathogen> rerio<pathogen> The acute toxicity test indicated that the 24 , 48 , 72 , 96h LC
