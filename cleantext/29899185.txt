  The purpose of this research was to assess whether the presence of seminal plasma ( SP) can improve sperm quality of rabbit spermatozoa stored at 16ºC for 72 hours and moreover evaluate the cryoprotectant effects of glycerol , N-N-Dimethylformamide ( DMF) , and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone ( NMP). Semen samples were pooled and divided in eight fractions. Four of them were diluted with INRA ( extender A) , INRA with 6 % glycerol ( extender B) , INRA with 6 % DMF ( extender C) , or INRA with 6 % NMP ( extender D) , respectively. The other four fractions were centrifuged , and the supernatant was removed in order to eliminate SP.. Each sample was then resuspended with extender A , B , C , or D , respectively. All samples were stored at 16ºC and analysed at 4 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hours by ISAS
