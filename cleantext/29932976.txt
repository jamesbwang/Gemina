  Recently , we have introduced fibrous dosage forms prepared by 3D-micro-patterning of drug-laden viscous melts. Such dosage forms enable predictable microstructures and increased drug release rates , and they can be manufactured continuously. However , melt processing is not applicable if the melting temperature of the formulation is greater than the degradation temperature of the drug or of the excipient. In this work , therefore , a continuous wet micro-patterning process that operates at ambient temperature is presented. The excipient is plasticized by a solvent and the patterned dosage form is solidified by air drying. Process models show that the micro-patterning time is the ratio of the fiber length in the dosage form and the velocity of the fiber stream. It was 1.3 min in the experiments , but can be reduced further. The drying time is limited by the diffusive flux of solvent through the fibers: it was about 3 min for the experimental conditions. Furthermore , models are developed to illustrate the effects of fiber radius , inter-fiber spacing , viscosity of the drug-excipient-solvent mixture , and drying conditions on the microstructure of the dosage form. Both models and experimental results show that for a viscosity of the wet fibers of the order 10
