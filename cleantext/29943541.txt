  PPP2R2A is one of the regulatory subunits of the PP2A phosphatase complexes , and previous studies showed that its upregulation promotes cancer cell survival and growth. In this research , we used the tandem affinity purification and the HPLC-Chip-ESI/MS/MS mass spectrometry to screen the PPP2R2A-binding proteins and the results indicated that the GFPT-1/ -2 were the potential partners of PPP2R2A. We further validated the interaction between PPP2R2A and GFPT-1/ -2 through GST Pull-down , co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. And we found that knockdown of PPP2R2A by lentivirus-mediated shRNA enhanced the phosphorylation of GFPT2 , whereas the phosphorylation of GFPT1 had no significant change. GFPT2 is a rate-limiting enzyme in the hexosamine pathway. Our results showed that the knockdown of PPP2R2A promoted the total cellular O-GlcNAcylation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. These results suggest that PPP2R2A interacts with GFPT1/2 , and leads to the phosphorylation of GFPT2 , which can regulate the cellular O-GlcNAcylation.
