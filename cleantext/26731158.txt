  Dialogue between conversational partners , including mothers and their children , is precisely timed. The predictability of this timing is important for establishing and maintaining interaction , communication , and learning. This longitudinal study examines changes in the response latency of utterances in dialogue between mothers and their normal hearing and hearing impaired children between 4 and 60 months of age. Mothers and their children showed parallel developmental trends , responding to each other more quickly at older ages. Beyond these age-related group effects , significant dyadic effects were found in which individual children 's latencies were related to those of their mothers , and vice versa. Developmental patterns did not significantly differ across hearing status groups , which may reflect the role of early identification and intervention in promoting positive developmental outcomes.
