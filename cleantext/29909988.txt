  Stress urinary incontinence ( SUI) is common among older multiparous females but rarely reported in active , young girls. Our hypothesis is: physically active adolescent females develop pelvic floor laxity demonstrable on upright VCUG. Our objectives are to ( 1) increase awareness of SUI in young females , ( 2) test our hypothesis with an upright VCUG , and ( 3) report effectiveness of step-wise management. A retrospective review was performed of nulliparous girls with only SUI seen from 2000 to 2015 , who were evaluated with upright voiding cystourethrography ( VCUG) ( bladder descent defined as â‰¥ 2 cm drop of bladder neck below pubic ramus at capacity). Data collection included level of physical activity , physical examination , BMI and Z-scores , urodynamics , management , and treatment response. Standard urotherapy ( SUT) ( timed voiding , proper diet , adequate fluids , bowel management) and biofeedback therapy ( BFT) was initiated. Fisher exact test was used to calculate ` p ' values. Thirty-three females ( median age 15.1 years , range 5.5-20.3) were identified who underwent an upright VCUG; 20 had bladder neck descent ( Fig.). Of these 20 , 15 ( 75 %) were involved in strenuous activity , whereas only three of 13 ( 23 %) without descent engaged in intense athletics. No differences were noted in median BMI and Z-score with strenuous activity ( 21.1 ( 15.2-26.7) and 0.31 ( -0.9-1.94)) , respectively , versus patients without ( 21.3 ( 15.8-33.5) and 0.62 ( -0.0-2.38)). Average follow-up for all was 16.6 months ( range 0.4-102.2). Of 20 demonstrating bladder neck descent , three did not complete therapy and were lost to follow-up. Only six of these 17 became dry. Of the remaining 11 , eight underwent surgery: Burch colposuspension ( 5) , fascial sling ( 2) , Coaptite to the bladder neck ( 1) , and an artificial urinary sphincter ( 1). This latter girl had a failed Burch colposuspension 1 year previously. All surgical patients are dry. Of 13 without bladder descent on VCUG , five did not complete therapy and were lost to follow-up. The remaining eight were managed non-surgically; seven were fully dry at last follow-up. Overall , 13 of 25 ( 52 %) achieved dryness. SUT and BFT were more effective in those without , than in those with bladder descent ( 87.5 % vs. 35.3 % , p = 0.0302 , Fisher exact test). Physically active , nulligravid girls with SUI can be efficaciously diagnosed on upright VCUG. They should be considered for non-surgical therapy but will likely require bladder neck elevating surgery. Non-surgical therapy works for those with minimal bladder descent on cystography.
