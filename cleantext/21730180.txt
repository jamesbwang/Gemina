  Observations indicate that temperature and precipitation patterns changed dramatically in Xinjiang , northwestern China , between 1961 and 2015. Dramatic changes in climatic conditions can bring about adverse effects. Specifically , meteorological drought severity based on the standardized precipitation index ( SPI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index ( SPEI) showed a decreasing trend in Xinjiang prior to 1997 , after which the trend reversed. SPEI-based drought severity shows a much stronger change during 1997-2015 than the SPI , which is independent of the effect of evaporative demand. Meteorological drought severity has been aggravated by a significant rise in temperature ( 1.1 Â°C) over the last two decades that has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in precipitation. As a result , the evaporative demand in Xinjiang has risen. An examination of a large spatio-temporal extent has made the aggravated drought conditions more evident. Our results indicate that increased meteorological drought severity has had a direct effect on the normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI) and river discharge. The NDVI exhibited a significant decrease during the period 1998-2013 compared to 1982-1997 , a decrease that was found to be caused by increased soil moisture loss. A positive relationship was recorded between evaporative demand and the runoff coefficients of the 68 inland river catchments in northwestern China. In the future , meteorological drought severity will likely increase in arid and semiarid regions as global warming continues.
