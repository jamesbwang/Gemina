  New methods for producing composite materials such as SPS ( Spark Plasma Sintering) are becoming more and more popular due to the ease of implementation in industrial conditions and the versatility of the materials used for processing. In order to fully exploit the potential of this method , modifications were proposed which consisted in the deliberate induction of deformation during the sintering process. The influence of the manufacturing method on the microstructure of aluminum alloy matrix composites reinforced with layered crystals in the form of nanoflakes was investigated. Composites with the addition of 10 vol % of multilayer graphene and molybdenum disulfide were prepared and their density , hardness , and the influence of the deformation ratio on the changes occurring in the microstructure were examined. The potential of the method to shape the properties of the tested composites and the strong dependence of the obtained results on the morphology of the reinforcing phase was indicated. An interesting phenomenon observed for composites with the addition of MoS â‚‚ during the process was the reaction of the components leading to in situ formation of the Al
