  In this work , we elucidate polymer-layered hollow Prussian blue-coated magnetic nanocomposites as an adsorbent to remove radioactive cesium from environmentally contaminated water. To do this , Fe ₃ O ₄ nanoparticles prepared using a coprecipitation method were thickly covered with a layer of cationic polymer to attach hollow Prussian blue through a self-assembly process. The as-synthesized adsorbent was confirmed through various analytical techniques. The adsorbent showed a high surface area ( 166.16 m ²/ g) with an excellent cesium adsorbent capacity and removal efficiency of 32.8 mg/g and 99.69 % , respectively. Moreover , the superparamagnetism allows effective recovery of the adsorbent using an external magnetic field after the adsorption process. Therefore , the magnetic adsorbent with a high adsorption efficiency and convenient recovery is expected to be effectively used for rapid remediation of radioactive contamination.
