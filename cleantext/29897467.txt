  The increase in infections as a result of MDR strains of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> is a global health crisis. The emergence of globally disseminated lineages of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> carrying ESBL genes has been well characterized. An increase in strains producing carbapenemase enzymes and mobile colistin resistance is now being reported , but to date there is little genomic characterization of such strains. Routine screening of patients within an ICU of West China Hospital identified a number of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> carrying the blaNDM-5 carbapenemase gene , found to be two distinct clones , E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ST167 and ST617. Interrogation of publicly available data shows isolation of ESBL and carbapenem-resistant strains of both lineages from clinical cases across the world. Further analysis of a large collection of publicly available genomes shows that ST167 and ST617 have emerged in distinct patterns from the ST10 clonal complex of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , but share evolutionary events involving switches in LPS genetics , intergenic regions and anaerobic metabolism loci. The identification of these lineages of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and their shared genetic traits suggest there may be evolutionary events that underpin the emergence of carbapenem resistance plasmid carriage in
