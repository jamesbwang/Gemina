  Ticagrelor , a new type of P2Y12 receptor antagonist , has been highly recommended to be used in acute coronary syndrome<pathogen> by the latest guideline , but its side effects are not well-known. We seek to illustrate a potential fatal condition , thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP) , caused by ticagrelor. An 87-year-old man who had been prescribed with ticagrelor for 2 months after ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) , presented with severe<pathogen> thrombocytopenia<pathogen> , anemia<pathogen> , renal and liver dysfunction , heart<pathogen> failure<pathogen> and fever.<pathogen> Peripheral blood smear showed schistocytosis , and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13 ( ADAMTS13) activity is low , with normal initial coagulation tests , which were compatible with a diagnosis of TTP. After cessation of ticagrelor and initiation of therapeutic plasma exchange , our patient recovered. Re-administration of ticagrelor aggravated TTP and led the patient to death. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of ticagrelor-induced TTP in patients with a history of recent myocardial infarction; It is of crucial significance to discontinue and never reuse ticagrelor as long as it is suspected to be implicated in TTP.
