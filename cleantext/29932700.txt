  Frequency-comb based multidimensional coherent spectroscopy is a novel optical method that enables high-resolution measurement in a short acquisition time. The method 's resolution makes multidimensional coherent spectroscopy relevant for atomic systems that have narrow resonances. We use double-quantum multidimensional coherent spectroscopy to reveal collective hyperfine resonances in rubidium vapor at 100 Â°C induced by dipole-dipole interactions. We observe tilted and elongated line shapes in the double-quantum 2D spectra , which have never been reported for Doppler-broadened systems. The elongated line shapes suggest that the signal is predominately from the interacting atoms that have a near zero relative velocity.
