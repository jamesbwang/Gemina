  Over the past 5 years , many studies have reported the prognostic value of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha ( HIF-1α) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However , the results have not reached a consensus until now. Therefore , we performed this meta-analysis to investigate the influence of HIF-1α expression on the prognosis and clinical characteristics in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We searched PubMed , the Cochrane Library , Embase ( via Ovid interface) , Web of Science , and China National Knowledge Infrastructure electronic databases from their establishment to 6 December 2017. We calculated the hazard ratio ( HR) and the odds ratio ( OR) to assess the prognostic and clinicopathological values of HIF-1α , respectively. Q test and I A total of 18 studies with 1476 patients were included in our meta-analysis. We found HIF-1α expression was associated with poor overall survival ( HR = 1.77; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.35 , 2.32; P < 0.001) , poor progression-free survival ( HR = 1.72; 95 % CI 1.22 , 2.44; P = 0.002) , a higher rate of lymph node metastasis ( OR = 3.81; 95 % CI 2.60 , 5.58 , P < 0.001) , and more advanced tumor stage ( OR = 2.98; 95 % CI 1.79 , 4.97; P < 0.001). Our study demonstrated that HIF-1α could be an appropriate prognostic biomarker for nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.
