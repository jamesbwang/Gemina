  This retrospective , observational study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the sampling methods commonly used for the collection of corneal scrapes for the diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis<disease> ( AK) by culture , in terms of their ability to provide a positive result. A total of 553 samples from 380 patients with suspected AK received at the Parasitology Section of the Public Health Institute of Chile , between January 2005 and December 2015 , were evaluated. A logistic regression model was used to determine the correlation between the culture outcome ( positive or negative) and the method for sample collection. The year of sample collection was also included in the analysis as a confounding variable. Three hundred and sixty-five samples ( 27 %) from 122 patients ( 32.1 %) were positive by culture. The distribution of sample types was as follows: 142 corneal scrapes collected using a modified bezel needle ( a novel method developed by a team of Chilean corneologists) , 176 corneal scrapes obtained using a scalpel , 50 corneal biopsies , 30 corneal swabs , and 155 non-biological materials including contact lens and its paraphernalia. Biopsy provided the highest likelihood ratio for a positive result by culture ( 1.89) , followed by non-biological materials ( 1.10) and corneal scrapes obtained using a modified needle ( 1.00). The lowest likelihood ratio was estimated for corneal scrapes obtained using a scalpel ( 0.88) and cotton swabs ( 0.78). Apart from biopsy , optimum corneal samples for the improved diagnosis of AK can be obtained using a modified bezel needle instead of a scalpel , while cotton swabs are not recommended.
