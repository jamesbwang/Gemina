  The purpose of this study is to validate a Monte Carlo simulation model for the clinical Siemens Biograph mCT PET scanner using the GATE simulation toolkit , and to evaluate the performance of six different scintillation materials in this model using the National Electrical Manufactures Association ( NEMA) NU 2-2007 protocol. A model of the Biograph mCT PET detection system and its geometry was developed. NEMA NU 2-2007 phantoms were also modelled. The accuracy of the developed scanner model was validated through a comparison of the simulation results from GATE , SimSET and PeneloPET toolkits , and experimental data obtained using the NEMA NU 2-2007 protocols. The evaluated performance metrics included count rate performance , spatial resolution , sensitivity , and scatter fraction ( SF). Thereafter , the mCT PET scanner was simulated with six different candidate high-performance scintillation materials , including LSO , LaBr The Monte Carlo simulation model demonstrates good agreement with the experimental data and results from other simulation packages. For instance , the scatter fraction calculated using GATE simulation is 34.35 % while the experimentally measured value is 33.2 % , 38.48 % for the SimSET , and 34.8 % for the PeneloPET toolkit. The best-performing scintillation materials were found to be LuAP , LSO and LFS-3 , while GLuGAG offers acceptable performance if cost is the dominant concern. The main performance characteristics of the Biograph mCT PET scanner can be simulated accurately using GATE with a good agreement with other Monte Carlo simulation packages and experimental measurements. Newly developed scintillators show promise and offer alternative options for the design of novel generation PET scanners.
