  Metastasis to regional lymph nodes ( RLNs) in dogs with cutaneous mast cell tumour ( cMCT) has been correlated with shortened survival time and higher risk of spread to distant sites. In the present study , extirpation of non-palpable or normal-sized RLNs was included in the surgical management of cMCT in dogs. Correlations between histological nodal status ( HN0-3) and tumour variables were analysed. Ninety-three dogs with single cMCT without distant metastasis that underwent wide surgical excision of the primary tumour and extirpation of non-palpable or normal-sized RLN were included. The association between HN ( HN0 vs HN > 0; HN0-1 vs HN2-3) and tumour variables ( site , longest diameter , ulceration , 3-tier and 2-tier histological grades) was analysed by a generalized linear model with multinomial error. Then , 33 ( 35.5 %) RLNs were HN0 , 14 ( 15 %) were HN1 , 26 ( 28 %) were HN2 and 20 ( 21.5 %) were HN3. The presence of positive ( HN > 0) RLN was significantly associated with cMCT larger than 3 cm. No other association was statistically significant. Non-palpable/normal-sized RLN in dogs with cMCT can harbour histologically detectable metastatic disease in nearly half of the cases. Extirpation of the RLN should always perfomed to obtain a correct staging of the disease , even in the absence of clinical suspicion of metastasis. Further studies should evaluate the possible therapeutical effect of the tumour burden reduction obtained by exrtipartion of a positive RLN.
