  The purpose of this article is to describe the large number of radiotracers being evaluated for prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA) PET , which is becoming a central tool in the staging of prostate cancer. PSMA PET is a highly promising modality for the staging of prostate cancer because of its higher detection rate compared with that of conventional imaging. Both PET/CT and PET/MRI offer benefits with PSMA radiotracers , and PSMA PET findings frequently lead to changes in management. It is imperative that subsequent treatment changes be evaluated to show improved outcomes. PSMA PET also has potential applications , including patient selection for PSMA-based radioligand therapy and evaluation of treatment response.
