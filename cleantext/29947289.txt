  Extensive preclinical studies suggest sex steroids are neuroprotective in experimental traumatic brain injury ( TBI). Yet , clinical trials involving sex hormone administration have not shown beneficial results , and our observational cohort studies show systemic estradiol ( E2) production to be associated with adverse outcomes. Systemic E2 is produced via aromatization of testosterone ( T) or reduction of estrone ( E1). E1 , also produced via aromatization of androstenedione ( Andro) and is a marker of T-independent E2 production. We hypothesized E1 would be 1) associated with TBI-related mortality 2) the primary intermediate for E2 production and 3) associated with adipose tissue specific aromatase transcription. We assessed 100 subjects with severe TBI and 8 healthy controls. Serum levels were measured D0-3 post-TBI for key steroidogenic precursors ( progesterone) , aromatase pathway intermediates ( E1 , E2 , T , Andro) and adipose tissue-specific aromatase transcription factors cortisol , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-alpha ( TNF-Î±) , and interleukin-6 ( IL-6). E1 was elevated after TBI versus controls. High E1 was associated with higher progesterone , cortisol and IL-6 ( p < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that those in the highest E1 tertile had increased odds for mortality ( adjusted OR = 5.656 , 95 % CI = 1.102-29.045 , p = 0.038). Structural equations models shows early serum E2 production is largely T-independent , occurring predominantly through E1 metabolism. Acute serum E1 functions as a mortality marker for TBI through aromatase-dependent E1 production and T-independent E2 production. Further work should evaluate risk factors for high E2 production and how systemic E2 and its key intermediate E1 contribute to the extracerebral consequences of severe TBI.
