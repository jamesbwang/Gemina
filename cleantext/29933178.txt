  This study aimed to examine Theory of Mind ( ToM) and social competence in children and adolescents with genetic generalised epilepsy ( GGE) , and explore how they relate to neurocognitive and epilepsy variables. Twenty-two children and adolescents with GGE ( 8-16 years old) and 22 typically developing controls completed two behavioural tasks ( faux-pas , strange stories) assessing cognitive and affective ToM , and a battery of standardised neuropsychological tests. Parents completed questionnaires assessing ToM and social competence. Neurologists completed the Global Assessment Severity of Epilepsy ( GASE) scale to measure of epilepsy severity. Children and adolescents with GGE were impaired in both cognitive and affective ToM , and had reduced social competence compared to controls , which was not attributable to low intellectual functioning or impaired executive skills ( working memory , inhibition). Lower ToM correlated with reduced social competence in children and adolescents with GGE. Clinical variables identified included: ( i) higher daily dosage of valproate , which was correlated with reduced affective ToM , ( ii) higher daily dosages of ethosuximide and lamotrigine , which were correlated with reduced social competence , and ( iii) overall epilepsy severity on the GASE , which was correlated with reduced social competence. Our study revealed cognitive and affective ToM impairments in children and adolescents with GGE , which correlated with everyday social problems. Moreover , higher dosages of commonly prescribed anti-epileptic drugs and overall epilepsy severity were related to ToM impairments and social competence problems. Although preliminary , these findings provide critical information for detection and screening procedures for social difficulties in children and adolescents with GGE , which are currently lacking.
