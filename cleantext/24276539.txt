  The area of saline soils accounts for 8 % of the earth 's surface , making these soils an important terrestrial carbon sink. Soil organic carbon ( SOC) , microbial biomass carbon ( MBC) , dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) , soil enzyme activity , and soil bacterial abundance and biodiversity were measured in four successive coastal tidal flat ecosystems representing: bare saline soil ( BS) , Suaeda glauca land ( SL) , Imperata cylindrica grassland ( IG) , and Jerusalem artichoke field ( JF). A decrease in soil salt content resulted in increased SOC content. With vegetation succession , MBC and DOC concentrations showed a positive trend , and activities of soil urease , catalase , invertase and alkaline phosphatase increased. A next-generation , Illumina-based sequencing approach showed that Proteobacteria , Acidobacteria , Chloroflexi , Bacteroidetes , Gemmatimonadetes , Actinobacteria , Nitrospirae and Planctomycetes were the dominant bacterial communities ( a total of 597 taxa were detected , and 27 genera showed significant differences among the vegetation communities). Bacterial diversity at two soil depths was enhanced with the succession of vegetation ecosystems , with the increases in operational taxonomic units ( OTUs) and the Shannon and Chao1 indices ranked in the order: JF > IG > SL > BS. The SOC and C/N were the most determinant factors influencing diversity of bacterial communities in the succession ecosystems.
