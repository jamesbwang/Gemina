  A method was established for the quantitative analysis of the elements ( Cu , Ag , Pb , and Sn) in solder samples by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( LA-ICP-MS) , with Sn-based matrix matched standard solutions for defining the calibration curves. It was found that chloride-ion presented in commercially available Sn standard solution resulted in a precipitation of AgCl and caused the deterioration of the linearity of the calibration curve for Ag. Therefore , a laboratory-made chloride-free Sn solution was used to prepare Sn matrix matched standard solutions so as to ensure the stability of the elements including Ag. For the quantitative analysis of solder samples by LA-ICP-MS , the operating conditions of the LA instruments were set to obtain a fluence of over 12 J cm
