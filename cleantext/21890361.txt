  Walking on various surfaces encountered in everyday life requires lower limb prosthesis users to continually adapt their movement patterns. Elevated vacuum suspension systems could improve transtibial amputee gait on non-level surfaces; however , research is lacking to guide clinical practice. Twelve transtibial amputees were fitted with the Ã–ssur sleeveless vacuum suspension system ( Unity). After a one month accommodation period , the CAREN-Extended system was used to evaluate gait on a self-paced treadmill when walking with continuous perturbations ( medial-lateral translations , rolling hills , simulated uneven ground) with an active or inactive vacuum suspension system. Significant differences between active and inactive vacuum conditions ( p < 0.05) were found for some temporal-spatial and kinematic gait parameters , but the differences were small and not considered clinically significant. Our findings suggest that potential vacuum pump failures would not immediately affect gait performance in a moderately high functioning amputee population. However , residual limb volume changes over time due to the removal of elevated vacuum may adversely affect socket fit , leading to greater gait differences and reduced quality of life.
