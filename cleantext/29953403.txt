  Background Nursing students play a role in promotion of public health as health promoters and professional care providers. Therefore , health-promoting behaviors in nursing students and their self-efficacy for health practices are important in providing better services to patients and clients. With regard to the importance of these factors in the academic progress of students , this study was conducted to examine the level of health-promoting behaviors among nursing students and its relationship with self-efficacy for health practices and academic achievement. Methods This descriptive and correlational study was conducted on 217 nursing students of a large university of medical sciences in the south of Iran in 2016. Data were collected using the Persian version of the health promotion lifestyle profile ( HPLP II) , self-rated abilities for health practices scale ( SRAHPS) and the grade point average of the students ( levels A , B , C). Results The mean health-promoting behaviors ( 2.48 ± 0.35) and self-efficacy for health practices of the students ( 2.55 ± 0.62) were moderate. The mean score of the students ' academic achievement was at level B ( 16.02 ± 1.85). The health-promoting behaviors were significantly correlated with self-efficacy for health practices ( r = 0.623 , p < 0.0001) and academic achievement ( r = 0.285 , p < 0.0001). Moreover , self-efficacy for health practices was significantly correlated with academic achievement ( r = 0.282 , p < 0.0001). Conclusion The correlation between the health-promoting behaviors and health self-efficacy with academic achievement can be a good basis in devising health and educational programs for students. In planning for promoting academic achievement and health-promoting behaviors of students , it is essential to pay special attention to enhancement of self-efficacy for health practices.
