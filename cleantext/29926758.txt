  The SYNERGY stent is composed of thin , platinum-chromium metal alloy struts and an ultrathin , bioabsorbable poly-DL-lactide-co-glycolide polymer limited to the abluminal strut surface which elutes everolimus prior to complete resorption within 3-4 months. SYNERGY was designed to reduce inflammation<symptom> and facilitate stent healing compared with permanent polymer drug eluting stents. This review summarizes the preclinical and clinical development of SYNERGY , its integration into clinical practice and future directions.
