  The prevalence of arthritis<disease> in the United States is substantial and on the rise. Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids , which have anti-inflammatory properties , have been shown to provide therapeutic benefit to arthritis<disease> patients; however , to date few have examined these associations with arthritis<disease> risk. The study objective was to examine the associations of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake with osteoarthritis ( OA) and rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) risk among postmenopausal women. This was a prospective cohort study. The sample for this analysis consisted of 80,551 postmenopausal women , aged 55 to 79 years and with no history of arthritis<disease> , recruited into the Women 's Health Initiative Observational Study and Clinical Trials cohort between 1993 and 1998. Women completed a 120-item food frequency questionnaire at baseline. After a median follow-up of 8 years , 22,306 incident OA and 3,348 RA cases were identified. Adjusted Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95 % CI for the associations between dietary LCn-3PUFA intake and OA and RA risk. Individual and total long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( Quintile 5 vs Quintile 1: hazard ratio 1.04 , 95 % CI 0.99 to 1.09 for OA; hazard ratio 1.01 , 95 % CI 0.90 to 1.13 for RA) were not associated with OA and RA risk. Further , no associations were observed between n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake and either arthritis<disease> outcome. This study is the first to examine associations of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids intake with OA risk and the largest to examine associations with RA risk. Despite their therapeutic potential , the study provides no evidence of benefit of these nutrients in relation to arthritis<disease> risk.
