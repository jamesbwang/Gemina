  This study examined the effect of a physical treatment ( speed , power and strength training) and psychosocial treatment ( group motivational presentation) on salivary testosterone ( sal-T) , salivary cortisol ( sal-C) , and sal-T to sal-C ratio ( T: C) in professional rugby. Fourteen male rugby players aged 25.9 ± 2.5 years , height 186.1 ± 6.7 cm , and body mass 104.1 ± 12.7 kg participated in this study. Testing occurred across two days on two separate occasions ( week one and week two). On day one of both weeks participants completed a speed , power and strength ( SPS) training session. On day two of both weeks participants undertook a field-based rugby training session. In week two participants underwent an additional treatment in the form of a motivational presentation given by a respected former player before the rugby session. Saliva was collected before and after SPS training and before and after the rugby session and was assayed for testosterone and cortisol. No differences were found between weeks for sal-T at any time point , but sal-C was higher in week two before and after SPS , and before rugby on day two ( p < 0.05). Both weeks , T: C increased following SPS ( p < 0.02 , ES > 0.91 ( 0.13 , 1.69)). T: C increased when the motivational presentation accompanied rugby training ( p = 0.07 , ES = 1.06 ( 0.27,1.85)). Sal-C drove changes in T: C ( p < 0.001) , not sal-T. We conclude that physical or psychosocial treatments may affect sal-T , sal-C and T: C; and individual variation in responses to treatments may exist.
