  An expert elicitation was staged to rapidly decipher plausible routes and risks of pathogen transmission in the 2017 H7N9 avian influenza<disease> ( AI) outbreak in the four-state region of Tennessee , Alabama , Georgia , and Kentucky. The process included the identification of risk factors found in a preponderance of commercial broiler breeder case farms over matched controls and an opinion-based weighting of risks and mitigations perceived influential to this outbreak. Although the two highly pathogenic AI case farms had general location and company ownership in common , obvious connections were lacking for the remainder of H7N9-infected ( all low pathogenicity) commercial farms. Expert elicitation of differences between known cases and controls suggested a key role for environmental rather than lateral ( business network) pathways in the distribution of low pathogenicity AI across commercial broiler breeder operations. Factors with greatest strength as predictors of disease , whether or not they were causal , included mesopredator or rodent incursions , enclosure defects , and habitat disturbance that might attract wildlife to the farm ( e.g. , feed spills and vacating of neighboring properties). Business affiliations that may have facilitated farm-to-farm transfer , in contrast , were limited. Biosecurity standards varied across this study group but were no more or less stringent among cases over controls. However , results from a parallel hypothetical scenario staged to address field data gaps suggest that uniformity and consistency in the implementation of biosecurity practices may impact risk of disease introduction. Importantly , this study was conducted within a few weeks and with little disruption to emergency response activities. As such , the approach offers an alternative model for interim field investigation of new or emerging high-consequence diseases with immediate decision support needs.
