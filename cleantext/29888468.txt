  In this study , volume density of white matter and grey matter areas of cervical segment of spinal cord in adult geese weighing 3-4 kg was examined using stereological methods. 10 geese were used as material without sex discrimination. All animals underwent perfusion with 10 % buffered formaldehyde. Following the perfusion , animals were kept in 10 % formaldehyde for 1 week. Geese were then dissected. Cervical area of spinal cord was revealed removing cervical spine. Tissue samples were obtained from each segment of cervical area. 5 Î¼m thick cross-sections were taken from these tissue samples via microtome. Series of cross-sections were obtained by sampling in the ratio of 1/250 including 12 cross-sections from each cervical segment of every animal. Cross-sections were stained by haematoxylin eosin. They were photographed under microscope. Volume density ( volume fractions) of both whole tissue and white matter and grey matter parts in each cervical segment of spinal cord were calculated using Cavalieri 's Principle. In the study , total volume of cervical segment , volume of white matter and grey matter , and ratios of these volumes one another were assessed in goose.
