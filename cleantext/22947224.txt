  The present study used a mild contusion injury in rat spinal cord to determine that thymoquinone reduces inflammatory response , oxidative stress and apoptosis in a spinal cord injury ( SCI) rat model and to demonstrate its possible molecular mechanisms. The rats in the thymoquinone group received 30 mg/kg thymoquinone once daily by intragastric administration from 3 weeks after surgery. Hematoxylin and eosin staining , Basso , Beattie and Bresnahan ( BBB) scale and tissue water content detection were used in the present study to analyze the effect of thymoquinone on SCI. The activity of inflammatory response mediators , oxidative stress factors and caspase-3/ 9 was measured using ELISA kits. Furthermore , western blotting was performed to analyzed the protein expression levels of prostaglandin E2 , suppressed cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2) and activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ ( PPAR-γ) , PI3K and Akt. The results from the study demonstrated that thymoquinone increased Basso , Beattie and Bresnahan score and decreased water content in spinal cord tissue. Treatment with thymoquinone decreased inflammatory response ( measured by levels of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor α , interleukin ( IL) -1 β , IL-6 and IL-18) , oxidative stress ( measured by levels of superoxide dismutase , catalase , glutathione and malondialdehyde) and cell apoptosis ( measured by levels of caspase-3 and caspase-9) in SCI rats. Thymoquinone treatment inhibited prostaglandin E2 activity , suppressed COX-2 protein expression and activated PPAR-γ , PI3K and p-Akt protein expression in SCI rats. These data revealed that thymoquinone reduces inflammatory response , oxidative stress and apoptosis via PPAR-γ and PI3K/Akt pathways in an SCI rat model.
