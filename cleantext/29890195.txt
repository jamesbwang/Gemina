  In vitro systems allowing maintenance and experimentation on primary astrocyte cultures have been used for decades. Astrocyte cultures are most maintained in serum-containing medium which has been found to alter the morphology and gene profiles of astrocytes. Here , we reported a new serum-free medium for astrocyte culture , which consisted of DMEM and NB media supplemented with insulin and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor ( HB-EGF) ( SF-I-H medium). Meanwhile FBS-containing ( FBS) medium<pathogen> composed of DMEM medium containing 10 % FBS were used for comparison study. Cerebral cortex was harvested from postnatal day 1 Wistar rats and brain cells were isolated and seeded to poly-L-lysine coated culture dishes after 15 min differential velocity adherence. Compared with FBS medium , astrocytes in SF-I-H medium were smaller and exhibited process bearing morphologies. MTT assays showed that cell density and proliferation rate were higher in SF-I-H medium than in FBS medium all the time , and flow cytometry analysis revealed that SF-I-H medium promoted cell mitosis in a manner comparable to FBS medium. Consistently , western blot analysis further revealed that insulin and HB-EGF synergistically activated the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling cascades as FBS. Astrocytes cultured in SF-I-H medium grew faster than FBS medium. Taken together , our results indicated that SF-I-H medium , in which cell morphology was similar with astrocytes in brain , was more effective for astrocyte survival and proliferation than FBS medium , providing a new cell model to study astrocyte functions without the interference of serum.
