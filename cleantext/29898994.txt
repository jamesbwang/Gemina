  p62 is a receptor that facilitates selective autophagy by interacting simultaneously with cargoes and LC3 protein on the autophagosome to maintain cellular homeostasis. However , the regulatory mechanism ( s) behind this process and its association with breast cancer remain to be elucidated. Here we report that Flightless-I ( FliI) , a novel p62-interacting protein , promotes breast cancer progression by impeding selective autophagy. FliI was highly expressed in clinical breast cancer samples , and heterozygous deletion of FliI retarded development of mammary tumors in PyVT mice. FliI induced p62-recruited cargoes into Triton X-100 insoluble fractions ( TI) to form aggregates , thereby blocking p62 recognition of LC3 and hindering p62-dependent selective autophagy. This function of Flil was reinforced by Akt-mediated phosphorylation at Ser436 and inhibited by phosphorylation of Ulk1 at Ser64. Obstruction of autophagic clearance of p62-recruited cargoes by FliI was associated with the accumulation of oxidative damage on proteins and DNA , which could contribute to the development of cancer. Heterozygous knockout of FliI facilitated selectively autophagic clearance of aggregates , abatement of ROS levels , and protein oxidative damage , ultimately retarding mammary cancer progression. In clinical breast cancer samples , Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FliI at Ser436 negatively correlated with long-term prognosis , while Ulk1-induced FliI phosphorylation at Ser64 positively correlation with clinical outcome. Together , this work demonstrates that FliI functions as a checkpoint protein for selective autophagy in the crosstalk between FliI and p62-recruited cargoes , and its phosphorylation may serve as a prognostic marker for breast cancer.
