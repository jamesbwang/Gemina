  The present study tested the hypothesis of a differential pattern of reward and punishment responsiveness in depression<symptom> measuring effort mobilization during anticipation and facial expressions during consumption. Twenty patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD) and 20 control participants worked on a memory task under neutral , reward , and punishment instructions. Effort mobilization was operationalized as cardiovascular reactivity , while facial expressions were measured by facial electromyographic reactivity. Self-report measures for each phase complemented this multi-method approach. During anticipation , MDD patients showed weaker cardiac pre-ejection period ( PEP) reactivity to reward and blunted self-reported wanting , but weaker PEP reactivity to punishment and unchanged self-reported avoidance motivation. During consumption , MDD patients showed reduced zygomaticus major muscle reactivity to reward and blunted self-reported liking , but unchanged corrugator supercilii muscle reactivity to punishment and unchanged self-reported disliking. These findings demonstrate reduced effort mobilization during reward and punishment anticipation in depression<symptom> Moreover , they show reduced facial expressions during reward consumption and unchanged facial expressions during punishment consumption in
