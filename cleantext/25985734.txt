  Successful treatment is possible with novel direct-acting oral antiviral agents in solid organ transplant patients with hepatitis<disease> C<disease> In this study , the effectiveness and safety of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir ± ribavirin treatment in liver and/or renal transplant patients with chronic hepatitis<disease> C<disease> were evaluated. A total of 23 liver and/or renal transplant patients who received sofosbuvir/ledipasvir ± ribavirin for chronic hepatitis<disease> C<disease> over 12 or 24 weeks were enrolled in the study. The treatment response , clinical and laboratory adverse effects , and effect on immunosuppressive drug levels were assessed. A total of 12 patients had undergone renal transplantation and 11 had undergone liver transplantation. All of the renal transplant patients and 91 % of liver transplant patients had genotype 1. In total , 10 renal transplant patients and 4 liver transplant patients had treatment experience. Two renal transplant patients and one liver transplant patient had compensated cirrhosis. Nine renal transplant patients were on tacrolimus , and two were on cyclosporine; all of the liver transplant patients were on tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive therapy. While hepatitis<disease> C<disease> RNA was negative in 75 % of renal transplant patients and 91 % of liver transplant patients at week 4 , it was negative in all of the patients at the end of treatment and 12 weeks after treatment. Significantly reduced hemoglobin levels were observed in patients administered ribavirin during treatment ( p = 0.01). There were no significant differences between the baseline and treatment period values of mean creatinine , estimated glomerular filtration rate , bilirubin , and tacrolimus levels. There were no adverse effects leading to treatment discontinuation. Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir ± ribavirin is quite safe and effective in hepatitis<disease> C<disease> treatment after liver and/or renal transplantation.
