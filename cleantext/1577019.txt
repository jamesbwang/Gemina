  Recently , immune checkpoint inhibitors have widely been used for the management of advanced melanoma. However , high-grade immune-related adverse events can occur , particularly with combination immunotherapy. We report a case of a patient with melanoma who developed thyroid storm following treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab. An 85-year-old Japanese man with a history of malignant melanoma presented to our department with severe thyrotoxicosis and poor blood glucose control. He was already being treated for Hashimoto 's disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus before the treatment for the melanoma. During admission , laboratory investigations revealed the following thyroid functions: thyroid-stimulating hormone below sensitivity , free triiodothyronine 31.7 pg/ml , and thyroglobulin 48,000 IU/ml. Thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody was negative , and a It might be important to be aware of the possibility of thyroid storm induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors.
