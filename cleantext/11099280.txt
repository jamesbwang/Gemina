  Schizophrenia is a chronic , debilitating condition that affects approximately 1 % of the population. Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia typically exhibit positive ( e.g. , hallucinations) and negative symptoms ( e.g. , anhedonia) and impairments in cognitive function. Given the limitations of antipsychotic medication and psychotherapy in fully treating psychosis symptomatology , there has been increasing interest in other interventions such as transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS). tDCS is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique , that is safe , cost-effective , and widely accessible. Here , we discuss treatment studies that seek to improve symptoms and cognitive performance in schizophrenia using tDCS. Currently within the literature , there is support for reductions in positive symptoms such as hallucinations after receiving tDCS. Further , studies indicate that tDCS can improve cognitive functioning , which is an area of investigation that is sorely needed , as it is unclear which types of interventions may be useful in ameliorating cognitive deficits among this group. Taken together , the evidence suggests that tDCS holds promise in improving symptoms and cognition. To that end , tDCS has critical clinical implications for this population.
