  A systematic review and meta-analyses were performed to evaluate the efficacy of tooth color<symptom> change<symptom> and sensitivity of teeth following in-office bleaching with and without light gel activation in adult patients. This review was registered at PROSPERO ( CRD 42017060574) and is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA). Electronic systematic searches of PubMed/MEDLINE , Web of Science , and the Cochrane Library were conducted for published articles. Only randomized clinical trials among adults that compared in-office bleaching with and without light activation with the same bleaching gel concentrations were selected. The outcomes were tooth color<symptom> change<symptom> and tooth sensitivity prevalence and intensity. Twenty-three articles from 1054 data sources met the eligibility criteria. After title and abstract screening , 39 studies remained. Sixteen studies were further excluded. Twenty-three studies remained for qualitative analyses and 20 for meta-analyses of primary and secondary outcomes. No significant differences in tooth color<symptom> change<symptom> or tooth sensitivity incidence were found between the compared groups; however , tooth sensitivity intensity decreased when light sources were applied. The use of light sources for in-office bleaching is not imperative to achieve esthetic clinical results.
