  We evaluated the correlation of the x-ray repair cross complementing gene 1 ( XRCC1) Arg194Trp polymorphism with clinical outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation therapy ( CCRT). In this prospective cohort study , we included 101 patients with HNSCC ( oral cavity , pharynx , and larynx) who were aged ≥ 18 years , had stage III to IVB disease , had a Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 80 , and were deemed fit for CCRT. DNA extraction was done through polymerase chain reaction , and the genotypes of XRCC1 polymorphism were detected using designed restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genetic polymorphisms were classified into wild and polymorphic variants ( Arg194Trp CT and TT). Radiation therapy was delivered with conventional parallel opposed lateral and low anterior neck fields with concurrent weekly cisplatin , 35 mg/m Of the patients , 62 had the wild type and 39 had polymorphic variants. Patients with polymorphic variants had higher rates of grade > 2 oral mucositis , with 35.8 % versus 16.0 % ( odds ratio ( OR) , 2.91; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.13-7.46; P = .023); dermatitis<disease> , with 30.7 % versus 8.0 % ( OR , 5.076; 95 % CI , 1.62-15.8; P = .003); and laryngeal toxicity , with 25.6 % versus 6.4 % ( OR , 5; 95 % CI , 1.44-17.54; P = .006). Complete response rates in polymorphic versus wild variants were 76.9 % versus 56.0 % ( P = .209). At a median follow-up of 21 months , the 2-year PFS and overall survival rates for patients with polymorphic versus wild variants were 57.0 % versus 42.2 % ( P = .077) and 73.0 % versus 55.5 % ( P = .143) , respectively. Polymorphic variant XRCC1 HNSCC patients treated with CCRT have significantly increased acute radiation morbidities and may have a trend toward better PFS in comparison with the wild variant.
