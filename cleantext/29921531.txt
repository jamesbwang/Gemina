  High-gravity brewing has been used to reduce costs and energy , as well as to produce new types of beer with high alcohol content. To identify the key metabolic pathways underlying efficient high-gravity brewing , we explored metabolites that were highly accumulated during alcoholic fermentation under high-maltose conditions using bottom-fermenting brewer 's yeast , Saccharomyces<pathogen> pastorianus. Based on metabolomic data , we focused on S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM) , which may be involved in glycolysis and alcoholic fermentation in the closely related yeast species Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> Exogenous SAM led to an increase in fermentation rate in both high-maltose synthetic medium and high-gravity wort. Although SAM is composed of methionine and the adenosine moiety of ATP , neither methionine nor adenosine significantly increased the fermentation rate. These results suggest that SAM is specifically associated with the fermentation rate of bottom-fermenting brewer 's yeast. Deletion of the adenosine kinase gene ADO1 , which leads to an accumulation of SAM in S.<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> cells , elevated the fermentation rate in high-glucose synthetic medium at 15 °C; however , this ado1Δ effect became less significant at higher temperatures. Similarly , a SAM-accumulating S. pastorianus mutant strain , with enhanced resistance to the adenosine analog cordycepin , exhibited a higher fermentation rate in both high-maltose synthetic medium and high-gravity wort. Taken together , our study demonstrates that SAM acts as a positive regulator in high-gravity brewing at low temperatures and that cordycepin resistance could serve as a useful indicator for breeding S. pastorianus strains with high fermentation performance.
