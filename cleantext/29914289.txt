  To evaluate the role of fractures on pathologic bone in healing of proximal humerus unicameral bone cysts<symptom> ( UBCs) and investigate the clinical factors that affect healing of UBCs after fractures on pathologic bone. This prospective study was carried out between 2002 and 2014. We evaluated 56 patients with a UBC accompanying fractures on pathologic bone in the proximal humerus. Clinical data were collected from the patients ' medical records. Age , gender , degree of fracture displacement , location of cyst<symptom> , and cyst<symptom> size were investigated , and we assessed how these factors affected cyst<symptom> healing. The overall healing rate of UBCs 1 year after fracture was 66 % ( 37 of 56 cases). The healing rate was significantly lower in pubescent patients ( 10-14 years old; 45 %) than in those who were 9 years old ( 76 %) or 15 years old ( 80 %). The rate of healing of fractures in the metaphysis ( 53 %) was lower than that of breaks in the diaphysis ( 85 %). The mean cyst<symptom> ratio was 1.31 in the 37 patients who experienced cyst<symptom> healing within 1 year and 1.79 in the 19 patients who needed surgical treatment within 1 year. In latent lesions<symptom> and in patients who are older ( after puberty) , UBCs of the humerus after fracture have better clinical results than do active lesions<symptom> and those in younger patients ( before puberty). Fractures on pathologic bone in proximal humerus UBCs often dramatically decrease cyst<symptom> size , and patients with such fractures have excellent clinical results in terms of healing rate.
