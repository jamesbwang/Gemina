  Reaction of cyclopropanated trans-cyclooctene ( cpTCO) with in situ generated ortho-quinone is an efficient tool for bioorthogonal protein conjugation. The ( 4 +2)- cycloaddition of cpTCO with ortho-quinone is significantly faster than its cyclooctyne counterpart ( BCN). Orthogonal , tandem cpTCO-quinone and BCN-azide cycloadditions afforded a homogeneous , dual labelled antibody-drug conjugate.
