  Myoblast proliferation and terminal differentiation are the key steps of myogenesis. MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs that play important roles in gene expression regulation. They negatively regulate gene expression by causing messenger RNA translational repression or target messenger RNA degradation. Here , we found that microRNA-423-5p ( miR-423-5p) is highly expressed in both slow and fast muscles. Our gain-of-function study indicated that miR-423-5p actually plays a negative role in regulating myoblast proliferation and differentiation. We also found that miR-423-5p is able to inhibit the expression of suppressor of fused homolog to inactivate the expression of the marker genes in myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Taken together , our findings indicated miR-423-5p as a potential inhibitor of myogenesis by targeting suppressor of fused homolog in myoblast , and it also contributes to a better understanding of the microRNAs-target gene regulatory network in different types of porcine muscle types and may benefit the practice of improving the meat quality in animal husbandry.
