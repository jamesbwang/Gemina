  Flowers act as multisensory billboards to pollinators by using a range of sensory modalities such as visual patterns and scents. Different floral organs release differing compositions and quantities of the volatiles contributing to floral scent , suggesting that scent may be patterned within flowers. Early experiments suggested that pollinators can distinguish between the scents of differing floral regions , but little is known about how these potential scent patterns might influence pollinators. We show that bumblebees can learn different spatial patterns of the same scent , and that they are better at learning to distinguish between flowers when the scent pattern corresponds to a matching visual pattern. Surprisingly , once bees have learnt the spatial arrangement of a scent pattern , they subsequently prefer to visit novel unscented flowers that have an identical arrangement of visual marks , suggesting that multimodal floral signals may exploit the mechanisms by which learnt information is stored by the bee.
