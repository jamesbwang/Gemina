  Real-world tolerability and effectiveness of nebivolol as first add-on therapy were compared with hydrochlorothiazide , metoprolol , and amlodipine. Medical records of hypertensive adults initiating nebivolol , hydrochlorothiazide , metoprolol , or amlodipine as first add-on therapy between December 16 , 2010 and July 21 , 2011 were retrospectively abstracted ( N = 1600; 400/treatment). Outcomes included medication-related side-effect rates and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) reduction and control. Compared with nebivolol , metoprolol and amlodipine had significantly higher side-effect rates ( incidence rate ratio ( 95 % CI): 1.82 ( 1.14-2.92) and 2.67 ( 1.69-4.21)) , respectively); the hydrochlorothiazide-nebivolol rate ratio was not significant ( 1.61 ( 0.95-2.71)). All treatments reduced BP at 2 months. Metoprolol , amlodipine , and hydrochlorothiazide were associated with significantly lower odds of achieving 2-month BP control than nebivolol ( odds ratios ( 95 % CI): 0.34 ( 0.23-0.51) , 0.51 ( 0.35-0.75) and 0.66 ( 0.44-0.99) , respectively). In a real-world setting , nebivolol as first add-on therapy was associated with fewer side effects than metoprolol or amlodipine and with a higher BP control rate than hydrochlorothiazide , metoprolol , or amlodipine.
