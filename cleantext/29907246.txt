  To evaluate whether specific obesity phenotypes in community-dwelling elderly: ( a) affect differently the relationship between frailty and functional impairment and ( b) are related to cognitive impairment. A post-hoc cross-sectional analysis of the last Israeli national health and nutrition survey of the elderly ( â‰¥ 65 yrs.; n = 1619). We implemented a previously validated frailty model based on frailty-related variables that were obtained in the survey. Mild cognitive impairment was defined using the Mini-Mental State Examination ( a score < 24 and > 17). The Katz 's scale of activities of daily living was used for functional assessment. Data were clustered according to different obesity phenotypes using measured body mass index ( BMI) and waist circumference ( WC). The link between frailty and disability was most prominent in subjects with abdominal obesity who were non-obese by BMI: compared with non-obese subjects as defined by WC and BMI , the odds ratio ( OR) for functional limitations in this phenotype was 8.34 ( 95 % CI , 2.14-32.48) for pre-frail subjects and 69.26 ( 10.58-453.55) for frail subjects. The rate of cognitive impairment was 3.3 times higher ( p = .023) in women who were obese by WC but not by BMI. In elderly people with a large WC and BMI < 30 kg/m
