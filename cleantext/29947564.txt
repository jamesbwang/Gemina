  The purpose of this article is to review the current literature describing primary care providers ' ( PCPs) attitudes related to lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , and queer/questioning ( LGBTQ) people. LGBTQ individuals experience significant health disparities , and these inequities may be better understood via an ecological systems framework. PCPs ' actual or perceived discriminatory attitudes can lead to suboptimal treatment or health outcomes for LGBTQ people. A review of the literature from 2005 through January 2017 was completed using the Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature and PubMed ( Medline) databases. The purpose , sample , measure ( s) , design , findings , strengths , and weaknesses<symptom> of each study were examined; and findings were synthesized , summarized , and critically appraised. Eight articles were eligible for review. There was significant heterogeneity in the studies ' purposes , research questions , LGBTQ population ( s) of focus , and findings. Many PCPs ' attitudes toward LGBTQ people were positive , but a minority of each studies ' participants had negative attitudes toward LGBTQ people. Stigma and health care barriers negatively affect LGBTQ health. Interventions must address LGBTQ health disparities at the individual , mesosytem , exosystem , and macrosystem levels. Research , education , and practice strategies all must be integrated across socioecological levels as components of a population-based approach to eliminate health disparities for LGBTQ persons.
