  The definition of antineoplastic administration sequences can help planning of therapeutic regimens in a more rational way , and thus optimize chemotherapy effects on patients , increasing efficacy and reducing toxic effects. In this way , this study aimed to evaluate the infusion order of antineoplastic agents of the main therapeutic protocols used in the treatment of colorectal and breast cancer which are used in a tertiary hospital , identifying possible interactions dependent on the infusion sequence. For the definition of protocols adopted in the hospital , medical prescriptions were used in the period of January to March 2016 and a literature review was conducted to search for studies assessing the sequence of administering the selected regimens. The databases used were SciELO , LILACS and MEDLINE , in addition to Micromedex Solutions ® and UpToDate ®. A total of 19 protocols were identified for antineoplastic therapy , 11 for colorectal cancer and 8 for breast cancer. The selected articles provided evidence for administration order of 19 protocols , and three protocols did no report relevance of infusion sequence. Sequence-dependent interactions were mainly related to toxicity , pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the drug combination. The definition of the infusion sequence has a great impact on the optimization of therapy , increasing efficacy and safety of the protocols containing combined antineoplastic therapies.
