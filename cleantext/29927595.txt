  Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> is a multidrug-resistant bacterium<pathogen> responsible for several cases of hospital-acquired infections , which constitute a global public health problem. The introduction of new healthcare strategies and/or the discovery of molecules capable of inhibiting the growth or killing S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> would have a huge impact on the treatment of S. aureus-mediated diseases. Herein , a Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor ( LzaBBI) , with strong in vitro antibacterial activity against S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , was purified to homogeneity from Luetzelburgia auriculata seeds. LzaBBI in its native form is a 14.3 kDa protein and has a pI of 4.54 , and its NH
