  The retrieval of information from memory through testing produces learning advantages that are superior to studying alone; a phenomenon called the testing effect. Despite strong and consistent evidence that testing improves retention and recall of information , and superior organization of information within memory , testing continues to be under-utilized as a pedagogical strategy by teachers and as a self-regulatory strategy by learners. Testing that promotes recall rather than recognition of information , that is repeated at intervals over time , and that is accompanied by feedback is optimal for promoting learning. In addition to using testing as a powerful teaching tool , educators should promote the use of self-testing by learners to support the life-long learning that is essential to professional practice.
