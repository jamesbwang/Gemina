  Bombyx mori , the domesticated silkworm , is of great importance as a silk producer and as a powerful experimental model for the basic and applied research. Similar to other animals , abundant microorganisms live inside the silkworm gut; however , surprisingly , the microbiota of this model insect has not been well characterized to date. Here , we comprehensively characterized the gut microbiota of the domesticated silkworm and its wild relatives. Comparative analyses with the mulberry-feeding moths Acronicta major and Diaphania pyloalis revealed a highly diverse but distinctive silkworm gut microbiota despite thousands of years of domestication , and stage-specific signatures in both total ( DNA-based) and active ( RNA-based) bacterial populations , dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria , Firmicutes , Actinobacteria , and Bacteroidetes. Most fungal sequences were assigned to the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Environmental factors , including diet and human manipulation ( egg production) , likely influence the silkworm gut composition. Despite a lack of spatial variation along the gut , microbial community shifts were apparent between early instars and late instars , in concert with host developmental changes. Our results demonstrate that the gut microbiota of silkworms assembles into increasingly identical community throughout development , which differs greatly from those of other mulberry-feeding lepidopterans from the same niche , highlighting host-specific effects on microbial associations and the potential roles these communities play in host biology.
