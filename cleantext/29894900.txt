  In recent years , considerable research effort has explored the interaction between semiconducting minerals and microorganisms , such relationship is a promising way to increase the efficiency of bioelectrochemical systems. Herein , the enhancement of electron transfer between birnessite photoanodes and Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> PAO1 under visible light was investigated. Under light illumination and positive bias , the light-birnessite-PAO1 electrochemical system generated a photocurrent of 279.57 Î¼A/cm
