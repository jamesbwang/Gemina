  To audit the extent of evaluation of neonates with antenatal hydronephrosis. Records of all neonates with antenatal hydronephrosis between January 2013 and December 2016 were audited to look for patient factors and investigation results. 290 records were evaluated , 93 ( 32 %) of which had abnormalities detected on voiding cystourethrogram. In the presence of hydroureter , 65 % had an abnormality while in the absence of only 11 % were abnormal. In the presence of pelvis > 20 mm , 93 % had abnormal diuretic renogram , while with pelvis < 20 mm , only 1.5 % were abnormal ( P = 0.001). Numbers needed to harm calculation revealed 1 in 2 patients would receive an unnecessary voiding cystourethrogram in the absence of hydroureter , and unnecessary diuretic renogram when pelvis < 20 mm. While evaluating neonates with antenatal hydronephrosis invasive tests can be limited , if evaluation is guided by ultrasonographic criteria.
