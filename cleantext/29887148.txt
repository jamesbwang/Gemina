  In this chapter , we describe current therapeutic targets for prion diseases. We focus on targets that have been validated in vitro and in vivo , leaving out a plethora of theoretic targets that still require validation. We also show how the development of improved model systems for the study of prion infection and neurotoxic mechanisms has enabled target identification. Some therapeutic targets are prion-specific , such as PrP
