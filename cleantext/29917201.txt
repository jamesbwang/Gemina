  To study the change rules of inflammatory factors in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) and serum of patients with viral meningitis<disease> 742 patients with suspected viral meningitis<disease> admitted to Department of Neurosurgery in our hospital from August 2012 to May 2016 were selected as research objects and retrospectively analyzed. 536 patients were diagnosed with viral meningitis<disease> by CSF with the lumbar puncture and brain computed tomography ( CT) , while the other 206 patients were diagnosed with non-infectious nervous system disease , as the control group. The levels of inflammatory factors interleukin-6 ( IL-6) in peripheral blood and procalcitonin ( PCT) in cerebrospinal fluid were detected and compared between two groups of patients. Compared with those in control group , the white blood cell ( WBC) count , and levels of serum IL-6 and PCT in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with viral meningitis<disease> were all increased ( p < 0.01). PCT and IL-6 were positively correlated with viral meningitis<disease> ( r = 0.8267 , 0.9234). The sensitivity of the two items was 77.81 % and 81.32 % , respectively , and the specificity was 90.53 % and 88.64 % , respectively. The levels of inflammatory factors IL-6 and PCT in serum and CSF of patients with viral meningitis<disease> are slightly increased. The detection of the expression levels of IL-6 and PCT in patients with viral meningitis<disease> is of great significance for the preliminary diagnosis and rehabilitation of viral
