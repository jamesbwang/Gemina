  Depression<symptom> and cognitive decline are reported to be interrelated. Depression<symptom> of older adults with memory complaints who seek medical help have not been well documented. This study was carried out to test the hypothesis that a relatively high level of depressive symptoms associated with brain structure is characteristic of people who visited a memory clinic unaccompanied ( UA). We retrospectively compared Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression<symptom> Scale ( CES-D , for evaluation of depressive symptoms) scores of UA subjects ( We found that the relatively high CES-D scores of UA subjects were inversely associated with the normalized volumes of bilateral superior temporal gyrus ( STG). Our results suggest that depressive symptoms of UA subjects demonstrated by the relatively high levels of CES-D scores were primary , because of the inverse association with the normalized volume of bilateral STG. Thus , focusing on the depressive symptoms may be a suitable approach to satisfy potential medical needs of UA subjects with or without
