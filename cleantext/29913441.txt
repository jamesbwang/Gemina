  Interleukin ( IL) -1 β plays an essential role in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis ( OA). Cytokine response modifier A ( CrmA) can prevent the generation of active IL-1β. This study aimed to explore the chondroprotective effects of hyaluronic acid-chitosan nanoparticles containing plasmid DNA encoding CrmA ( HA/CS-CrmA) in a rat OA model. HA/CS-CrmA nanoparticles were synthesized through the complex coacervation of cationic polymers. The characteristics , toxicity , and transfection of the nanoparticles were investigated. Furthermore , the potential effects of HA/CS-CrmA nanoparticles were evaluated via a rat anterior cruciate ligament transection ( ACLT) model of OA. Cartilage damage and synovial inflammation<symptom> were assessed by safranin O/fast green and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Type II collagen in cartilage was measured by immunohistochemistry , and the expression levels of IL-1β , matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP) -3 , and MMP-13 in synovial tissue were detected by western blot. The HA/CS-CrmA nanoparticles , which effectively entrapped plasmid DNA , showed an adequate size ( 100-300 nm) and a regular spherical shape. The nanoparticles safely transfected synoviocytes and released plasmid DNA in a sustained manner over 3 weeks. Additionally , HA/CS-CrmA nanoparticles significantly inhibited cartilage damage , synovial inflammation<symptom> , and the loss of type II collagen induced by ACLT. The expression levels of IL-1β , MMP-3 , and MMP-13 in synovial tissue were dramatically down-regulated by HA/CS-CrmA nanoparticles. These results suggested that HA/CS-CrmA nanoparticles could attenuate cartilage destruction and protect against early OA by inhibiting synovial inflammation<symptom> via inhibition of IL-1β generation.
