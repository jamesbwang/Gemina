  Superficial surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> ( SSI) is common after appendectomy. This study aims to determine a clinical prediction score for SSI after appendectomy in complicated appendicitis<disease> Data from randomized controlled trial of delayed versus primary wound<disease> closures in complicated appendicitis<disease> was used. Nineteen patient- and operative-related predictors were selected in the logit model. Clinical prediction score was then constructed using coefficients of significant predictors. Risk stratification was done by receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis. Bootstrap technique was used to internal validate the score. Among 607 patients , the SSI incidence was 8.7 % ( 95 % CI 6.4 , 11.2). Four predictors were significantly associated with SSI , i.e. , presence of diabetes , incisional length > 7 cm , fecal contamination , and operative time > 75 min with the odds ratio of 2.6 ( 95 % CI 1.2 , 5.9) , 2.8 ( 1.5 , 5.4) , 3.6 ( 1.9 , 6.8) , and 3.4 ( 1.8 , 6.5) , respectively. Clinical prediction score ranged from 0 to 4.5 with its discrimination concordance ( C) statistic of 0.74 ( 95 % CI 0.66 , 0.81). Risk stratification classified patients into very low , low , moderate , and high risk groups for SSI when none , one , two , and more than two risk factors were presented with positive likelihood ratio of 1.00 , 1.45 , 3.32 , and 9.28 , respectively. A bootstrap demonstrated well calibration and thus good internal validation. Diabetes , incisional length , fecal contamination , and operative time could be used to predict SSI with acceptable discrimination. This clinical risk prediction should be useful in prediction of SSI. However , external validation should be performed. ClinicalTrials.gov ( ID NCT01659983) , registered August 8 , 2012.
