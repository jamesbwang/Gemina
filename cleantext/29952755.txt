  The European Strategic Forum for Research Infrastructures ( ESFRI) &#13; has selected in 2006 a proposal based on ultra-intense laser elds with intensities &#13; reaching up to 10221023 W/cm2 called \ ELI '' for Extreme Light Infrastructure. &#13; The construction of a large-scale laser-centred , distributed pan-European research &#13; infrastructure , involving beyond the state-of-the-art ultra-short and ultra-intense &#13; laser technologies , received the approval for funding in 2011 2012. &#13; The three pillars of the ELI facility are being built in Czech Republic , Hungary &#13; and Romania. The Romanian pillar is ELI-Nuclear Physics ( ELI-NP). The new &#13; facility is intended to serve a broad national , European and International science &#13; community. Its mission covers scientic research at the frontier of knowledge &#13; involving two domains. The rst one is laser-driven experiments related to &#13; nuclear physics , strong-eld quantum electrodynamics and associated vacuum &#13; eects. The second is based on a Comptonbackscattering high-brilliance and &#13; intense low-energy gamma beam ( < 20 MeV) , a marriage of laser and accelerator &#13; technology which will allow us to investigate nuclear structure and reactions &#13; as well as nuclear astrophysics with unprecedented resolution and accuracy. In &#13; addition to fundamental themes , a large number of applications with signicant &#13; societal impact are being developed. The ELI-NP research centre will be located &#13; in Magurele near Bucharest , Romania. The project is implemented by \ Horia &#13; Hulubei '' National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering ( IFIN-HH). The &#13; project started in January 2013 and the new facility will be fully operational by &#13; the end of 2019. &#13; After a short introduction to multi-PW lasers and Multi-MeV brilliant gamma &#13; beam scientic and technical description of the future ELI-NP facility as well &#13; as the present status of its implementation of ELI-NP , will be presented. The &#13; science and examples of societal applications at reach with these new probes will &#13; be discussed with a special focus on day-one experiments and associated novel &#13; instrumentation.
