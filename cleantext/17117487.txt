  Imbalance of interferon-gamma ( IFN-γ) , interleukin ( IL) -4 , and IL-17 producing by T cells is confirmed to contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE). Autophagy is now emerging as a core player in the development and the function of the immune system. Therefore , we investigated the autophagic behavior in IFN-γ- , IL-4- , and IL-17-producing T cells from patients with SLE. Thirty patients with SLE and 25 healthy controls matched for gender and age were recruited between September 2016 and May 2017. The autophagic levels in IFN-γ Our results showed increased percentage of autophagy in IFN-γ The results indicate that autophagy in IFN-γ
