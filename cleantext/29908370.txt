  There is limited information on gender differences in patients with Brugada syndrome<disease> ( BrS) who experienced arrhythmic events ( AEs). The purpose of this study was to compare clinical , electrocardiographic ( ECG) , electrophysiological , and genetic characteristics between males and females in BrS patients with their first AE. The multicenter Survey on Arrhythmic Events in BRUgada Syndrome<disease> collected data on the first AE in 678 BrS patients including 619 males ( 91.3 %) and 59 females ( 8.7 %) aged 0.27-84 years ( mean age 42.5 ± 14.1 years) at the time of AE occurrence. After excluding pediatric patients , it was found that females were older than males ( 49.5 ± 14.4 years vs 43 ± 12.7 years , respectively; P = .001). Higher proportions of females were observed in the pediatric and elderly populations. In Asians , the male to female ratio for AEs was ≈ 9-fold higher than that in Caucasians. Spontaneous type 1 BrS ECG was associated with an earlier onset of AEs in pediatric females. A similar prevalence ( ≈ 65 %) of spontaneous type 1 BrS ECG was present in males and females above the age of 60 years. Females less frequently showed spontaneous type 1 BrS ECG ( 31 % vs 59 %; P < .001) or arrhythmia inducibility at electrophysiology study ( 34 % vs 64 %; P < .001). An SCN5A mutation was more frequently found in females ( 47.6 % vs 27.8 % in males; P = .007). This study confirms that female BrS patients are much rarer , display less type 1 Brugada ECG , and exhibit lower inducibility rates than do males. It shows for the first time that BrS females with AE have higher SCN5A mutation rates as well as the relationship between gender vs age at the onset of AEs and ethnicity.
