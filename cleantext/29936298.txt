  Sepsis<disease> is a rare but potentially devastating complication when it occurs after surgery for spinal tumors. Given the morbidity associated with sepsis<disease> , we sought to collate evidence using a large national surgical database to identify the incidence , pre-operative predictors and post-operative factors associated with sepsis<disease> following spinal tumor surgery. The 2005-2014 ACS-NSQIP database was queried for patients undergoing surgery for spinal tumors using ICD-9 codes for primary ( 170.2 , 170.6 , 213.2 , 213.6) or secondary ( 198.3 , 198.4 and 198.5) spinal tumor. Data were then filtered to include patients who underwent a laminectomy , corpectomy and/or spinal fusion for the tumor. A total of 1468 patients were included in the final cohort. Pre-operative risk factors were assessed using univariate regression models while adjusting for the occurrence of missing variables. Post-operative infectious sources such as urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( UTI) , pneumonia<disease> and surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> were assessed for any association with the occurrence of sepsis<disease>. A total of 44 patients ( 3.0 %) had an episode of sepsis<disease> within 30 days after surgery. Independent pre-operative factors significantly associated with the occurrence of sepsis<disease> were history of prior systemic inflammatory response syndrome<disease> ( SIRS) ( OR 2.89 ( 95 % CI 1.3-6.2)) , presence of Insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus ( IDDM) ( OR 3.52 ( 95 % CI 1.4-8.7) and a length of stay > 8 days ( OR 2.5 ( 95 % CI 1.0-6.2)). Independent infectious sources associated with occurrence of sepsis<disease> were surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> ( SSI) ( OR 23.3 ( 95 % CI 8.6-63.7)) , pneumonia<disease> ( OR 5.8 ( 95 % CI 2.2-15.2)) and urinary<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> ( UTI) ( OR 14.7 ( 95 % CI 5.96-36.1)). Up to 52 % of the cases of sepsis<disease> were associated with at least one source of infection ( UTI , pneumonia<disease> or SSI) with UTI being the most common ( 29.5 %) followed by pneumonia<disease> ( 22.7 %) and SSI ( 18 %). Three percent of patients following surgery for spinal tumor experience an episode of sepsis<disease> within 30 days. The most likely sources of sepsis<disease> include UTI , pneumonia<disease> and SSI. Pre- and post-operative targeted interventions in these high risk patients will be most beneficial in reducing the incidence , morbidity and mortality from sepsis<disease> after surgery for spinal tumors.
