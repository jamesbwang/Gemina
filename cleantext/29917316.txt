  Amphipathic cationic peptoids ( N-substituted glycine oligomers) represent a promising class of antimicrobial peptide mimics. The aim of this study is to explore the potential of the triazolium group as a cationic moiety and helix inducer to develop potent antimicrobial helical peptoids. Herein we report the first solid-phase synthesis of peptoid oligomers incorporating 1,2,3-triazolium-type side chains and their evaluation against Escherichia<pathogen> coli , Enterococcus<pathogen> faecalis<pathogen> , and Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> Several triazolium-based oligomers , even of short length , selectively kill bacteria over mammalian cells. SEM visualization of S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> cells treated with a dodecamer and a hexamer reveals severe cell membrane damage and suggests that the longer oligomer acts by pore formation.
