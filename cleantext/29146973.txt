  Fast charging is a key enabler of mainstream adoption of electric vehicles ( EVs). None of today 's EVs can withstand fast charging in cold or even cool temperatures due to the risk of lithium plating. Efforts to enable fast charging are hampered by the trade-off nature of a lithium-ion battery: Improving low-temperature fast charging capability usually comes with sacrificing cell durability. Here , we present a controllable cell structure to break this trade-off and enable lithium plating-free ( LPF) fast charging. Further , the LPF cell gives rise to a unified charging practice independent of ambient temperature , offering a platform for the development of battery materials without temperature restrictions. We demonstrate a 9.5 Ah 170 Wh/kg LPF cell that can be charged to 80 % state of charge in 15 min even at -50 °C ( beyond cell operation limit). Further , the LPF cell sustains 4,500 cycles of 3.5-C charging in 0 °C with < 20 % capacity loss , which is a 90 × boost of life compared with a baseline conventional cell , and equivalent to > 12 y and > 280,000 miles of EV lifetime under this extreme usage condition , i.e. , 3.5-C or 15-min fast charging at freezing temperatures.
