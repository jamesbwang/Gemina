  An 80-year-old woman sustained a fracture-dislocation of the proximal aspect of the humerus with a near-complete brachial plexopathy , which was successfully managed acutely using a reverse shoulder arthroplasty ( RSA<pathogen>) with repair of the greater and lesser tuberosities. The palsy , which was confirmed with nerve conduction studies , recovered uneventfully along with functional improvement of the shoulder. At the most recent follow-up , there was complete resolution of the plexopathy , with excellent , pain-free range of motion. Acute RSA<pathogen> with tuberosity repair may be a reasonable treatment modality in the setting of an acute brachial plexus palsy following a comminuted fracture-dislocation of the proximal aspect of the humerus in an elderly patient.
