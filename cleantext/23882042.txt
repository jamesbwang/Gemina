  Endothelial barrier function in the onset and Tongxinluo ( TXL) protection of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R) injury , and TXL can induce the secretion of Angiopoietin-like 4 ( Angptl4) in human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells during hypoxia/reoxygenation. We intend to demonstrate whether TXL can attenuate myocardial I/R injury in diabetes , characterized with microvascular endothelial barrier disruption , by induction of Angptl4-mediated protection of endothelial barrier integrity. I/R injury was created by coronary ligation in ZDF diabetic and non-diabetic control rats. The animals were anesthetized and randomized to sham operation or I/R injury with or without the exposure to insulin , rhAngptl4 , TXL , Angptl4 siRNA , and the PPAR-α inhibitor MK886. Tongxinluo , insulin and rhAngptl4 have the similar protective effect on diabetic hearts against I/R injury. In I/R-injured diabetic hearts , TXL treatment remarkably reduced the infarct size , and protected endothelial barrier integrity demonstrated by decreased endothelial cells apoptosis , microvascular permeability , and myocardial hemorrhage<symptom> , fortified tight junction , and upregulated expression of JAM-A , integrin-α5 , and VE-cadherin , and these effects of TXL were as effective as insulin and rhAngptl4. However , Angptl4 knock-down with siRNA interference and inhibition of PPAR-α with MK886 partially diminished these beneficial effects of TXL and rhAngptl4. TXL induced the expression of Angptl4 in I/R-injured diabetic hearts , and was canceled by Angptl4 siRNA and MK886. TXL treatment increased myocardial PPAR-α activity , and was abolished by MK886 but not by Angptl4 siRNA. TXL protects diabetic hearts against I/R injury by activating Angptl4-mediated restoration of endothelial barrier integrity via the PPAR-α pathway.
