  Preoperative exercise and fitness are predictors of surgical recovery; however , little is known of the effect of preoperative exercise-based conditioning , known as prehabilitation , in this for men undergoing radical prostatectomy. Our study examined the feasibility and effects of prehabilitation on perioperative and postoperative outcomes in men undergoing radical prostatectomy. This feasibility RCT compared prehabilitation ( PREHAB) versus a control condition ( CON) in 86 men undergoing radical prostatectomy. PREHAB consisted of home-based , moderate-intensity exercise prior to surgery. Both groups received a preoperative pelvic floor training regimen. Feasibility was assessed via rates of recruitment , attrition , intervention duration and adherence , and adverse events. Clinical outcomes included surgical complications , and length of stay. The following outcomes were assessed at baseline , prior to surgery , and 4 , 12 , and 26-weeks postoperatively: 6-min walk test ( 6MWT) , upper-extremity strength , quality of life , psychosocial wellbeing , urologic symptoms , and physical activity volume. The recruitment rate was 47 % and attrition rates were 25 % and 33 % for PREHAB and CON , respectively. Adherence to PREHAB was 69 % with no serious intervention-related adverse events. After the intervention and prior to surgery , PREHAB participants demonstrated less anxiety<symptom> ( P = 0.035) and decreased body fat percentage ( P = 0.001) compared to CON. Four-weeks postoperatively , PREHAB participants had greater 6MWT scores of clinical significance compared to CON ( P = 0.006). Finally , compared to CON , grip strength and anxiety<symptom> were also greater in the PREHAB at 26-weeks ( P = 0.022) and ( P = 0.025) , respectively. While feasible and safe , prehabilitation has promising benefits to physical and psychological wellbeing at salient timepoints relative to radical prostatectomy.
