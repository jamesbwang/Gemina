  There seems to be a general agreement amongst practitioners of economic evaluations , including Health Technology Assessment , that the explicit statement of a perspective is a necessary element in designing and reporting research. Moreover , there seems also to be a general presumption that the ideal perspective is `` societal ''. In this paper we endorse the first principle but dissent from the second. A review of recommended perspectives is presented. The societal perspective is frequently not the one recommended. The societal perspective is shown to be less comprehensive than is commonly supposed , is inappropriate in many contexts and , in any case , is in general not a perspective to be determined independently of the context of a decision problem. Moreover , the selection of a perspective , societal or otherwise , is not the prerogative of analysts.
