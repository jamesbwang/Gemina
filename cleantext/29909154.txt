  Primary mediastinal ( thymic) large B cell lymphoma is a subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma with distinct clinical , molecular , and genetic features , many of which overlap with Hodgkin lymphoma. Increasingly , initial therapy for these patients has used dose-dense chemotherapy with or without radiation with excellent results. In patients with relapsed and primary refractory disease , outcomes of second-line therapy followed by consolidation with high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation remains largely undefined. We reviewed the outcomes of 60 transplant-eligible patients with relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal ( thymic) large B cell lymphoma enrolled on sequential protocols with uniform second-line therapy with intent to consolidate with autologous stem cell transplant. The estimated 3-year overall and event-free survivals for all patients were 61 % and 57 % , respectively , and 68 % and 65 % , respectively , for patients proceeding to stem cell transplant. Multivariable analysis of risk factors before transplant revealed that an incomplete response to initial therapy , advanced Ann Arbor stage at disease progression , and failure to achieve a partial remission or better to second-line therapy to be independently associated with inferior event-free and overall survival. A risk score based on these variables was able to identify patients who are unlikely to respond to conventional second-line strategies. These results suggest that salvage chemoradiotherapy with intent of subsequent high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant is successful in most patients with relapsed and refractory primary mediastinal ( thymic) large B cell lymphoma. Alternative strategies are warranted for a significant subset of patients with high-risk disease who are unlikely to be cured with this strategy.
