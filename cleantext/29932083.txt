  Little is known about the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> ( SSIs) in paediatric abdominopelvic surgical oncology. A retrospective analysis was performed upon the incidence of SSIs in children receiving a 24-hour antibiotic prophylaxis with cefazolin for abdominopelvic oncological surgery. In all , 145 patients ( 57 % females) with a median age of 4 years underwent surgical procedures for abdominopelvic tumours. No SSIs were detected , despite the various risk factors known to be associated with their occurrence ( such as pre- and post- surgical chemotherapy , long hospitalization , intensive care unit admission and drain placement). Cefazolin prophylaxis seems to be safe and effective in preventing SSIs in children undergoing abdominopelvic surgery for oncological diseases.
