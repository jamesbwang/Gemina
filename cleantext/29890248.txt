  Hydroxynitrile lyases ( HNLs) are widely used in the asymmetric synthesis of cyanohydrins which are organic compounds used in the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals , because these enzymes exhibit high catalytic efficiency and are very economical. In the present study , seeds of A. pedunculata Pall were identified as new potential source of HNLs. The HNL from A. pedunculata Pall ( APHNL) was purified 138 fold and 4.20 % yield with a specific activity of 661 U/mg. SDS-PAGE result showed the enzyme to be present as a monomer and the relative molecular mass determined by MALDI-TOF MS was 61 kDa. APHNL owned highest activity at pH 6.0 and at 60 °C temperature , showing activity up to 80 °C and stable up to 60 °C. APHNL has a Km of 0.5 mM , Vmax of 665.9 μmol mg
