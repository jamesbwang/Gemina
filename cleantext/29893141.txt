  In the province of Ontario , a new law requires restaurants and food service providers , with more than 20 locations in Ontario , to prominently list the calorie content of their food items on the menu. This study examined if the new calorie information shifted the Ontario consumer 's ability to more accurately estimate calories. Using an online survey , consumers ( n = 665 non-Ontario control and n = 694 Ontario) were asked to estimate the calories of a popular menu item ( a cheeseburger) prior to this new legislation and 3 months and 6 months after the introduction of the mandated calorie labels on menus. Early results suggest that one can not yet see a clear overall change in the Ontario consumer 's ability to estimate calories ( based on 1 popular food item) since the introduction of mandated calorie labels on menus , although the most recent survey data suggest promise. Consumers , not just in Ontario , are poor at estimating calories. Repeated exposure to the calorie information now posted on most Ontario fast-food menus is an educational initiative expected to show benefits in the future , but additional time is required for measurable increases in consumer knowledge.
