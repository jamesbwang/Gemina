  We describe a 10-month-old boy with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy who was found to have a hemizygous deletion in 9q33.3-q34.11 involving STXBP1 and SPTAN1 genes. He presented at the age of 2.5 months with frequent upper extremity myoclonus , hypotonia , and facial dysmorphisms. Interictal EEG showed multifocal polyspike and wave during wakefulness and sleep. Ictal EEG revealed low-amplitude generalized sharp slow activity , followed by diffuse attenuation. Metabolic testing was unrevealing. Brain MRI showed thinning of the corpus callosum with an absence of rostrum. This patient is the second reported case with 9q33.3-q34.11 deletion involving STXBP1 and SPTAN1 genes associated with epileptic encephalopathy and myoclonic seizures<symptom>. Larger case series are needed to better delineate this association.
