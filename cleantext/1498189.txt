  Obtaining good quality image features is of remarkable importance for most computer vision tasks. It has been demonstrated that the first layers of the human visual cortex are devoted to feature detection. The need for these features has made line , segment , and corner detection one of the most studied topics in computer vision. HT3D is a recent variant of the Hough transform for the combined detection of corners and line segments in images. It uses a 3D parameter space that enables the detection of segments instead of whole lines. This space also encloses canonical configurations of image corners , transforming corner detection into a pattern search problem. Spiking neural networks ( SNN) have previously been proposed for multiple image processing tasks , including corner and line detection using the Hough transform. Following these ideas , this paper presents and describes in detail a model to implement HT3D as a Spiking Neural Network for corner detection. The results obtained from a thorough testing of its implementation using real images evince the correctness of the Spiking Neural Network HT3D implementation. Such results are comparable to those obtained with the regular HT3D implementation , which are in turn superior to other corner detection algorithms.
