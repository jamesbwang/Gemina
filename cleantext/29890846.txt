  Many best practices have been described for organizing a clinic to manage warfarin. Although these practices may have face validity , they may not be based on empirical analysis. Here , we describe our decade-long effort to apply the Structure-Process-Outcome model of quality measurement as a basis for measuring and improving outpatient warfarin management in the Veterans Health Administration. The purpose of the article is to raise awareness of this body of work with pharmacists who could potentially incorporate the findings of this work into their own practice settings. We conclude with concrete suggestions for immediate implementation in clinical settings.
