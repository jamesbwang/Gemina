  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that extend over 2 nm in one dimension are seen as monodisperse graphene nanoribbons , which have attracted significant attention for a broad range of applications in organic electronics and photonics. Herein we report the synthesis of a stable bisthiadiazole-capped pyrene-containing nanoribbon with 18 linearly fused rings ( NR-18-TD). Thanks to the presence of alternating tert-butyl and tri-iso-butylsilyl groups , NR-18-TD is highly soluble in organic solvents and therefore its structure and fundamental optoelectronic , redox and electrical properties could be unambiguously established. This work illustrates that NR-18-TD is a promising soluble NR-based n-type semiconductor for applications in organic electronics.
