  Baicalein ( BE) is a flavonoid compound derived from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis. It has widely been used as anti-oxidant , anti-virus , anti-bacteria , anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic therapies. Due to its poor water solubility ( 16.82 Î¼g/ml) , the therapeutic effectiveness and oral bioavailability of Baicalein are highly limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of baicalein-theophylline ( BE-TH) cocrystals to achieve the simultaneous enhancement in dissolution and oral bioavailability of BE. The cocrystal had the new characteristic of scanning electron microscopy , differential scanning calorimetry thermograms and X-ray powder diffraction. Compared with coarse powder of BE , BE-TH cocrystals had significantly improved the solubility of BE. The dissolution test showed that the BE-TH cocrystals demonstrated 2.2-fold and 7.1-fold higher rate of dissolution than that of BE coarse powder in HCl ( pH = 1.2) and phosphate buffer ( PBS , pH = 6.8) , respectively. Moreover , the cocrystals exhibited a 5.86-fold higher area under the curve in rats after the oral administration. This investigation enriched the present understanding of cocrystals on their behavior in vitro and in vivo , and built the groundwork for future development of BE as a promising compound into efficacious drug products.
