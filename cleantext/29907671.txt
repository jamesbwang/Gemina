  This study aimed to test fecal calprotectin ( FC) as a screening tool to identify inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) among patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis<disease> ( JIA). FC level < 100 g/kg was considered normal. Patients with 2 consecutive FC dosage â‰¥ 100 g/kg underwent endoscopic evaluation. There were 113 patients with JIA enrolled. FC was raised in 7 patients out of 113. All patients had IBD. In 3/7 patients , high FC levels were the only sign consistent with IBD. FC is a useful , economical , and noninvasive diagnostic tool to identify JIA patients with underlying IBD.
