  We discuss the influence that involvement of fat ( perirenal , sinus) and vascular structures ( renal vein , segmental veins) have on cancer-specific mortality ( CSM) rates in renal cancer. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 140 stage pT3a kidney tumors ( 114 clear cell , 9 type I papillary , 6 type II papillary , 11 chromophobe) surgically treated between 1997 and 2015. We conducted a cancer-specific survival study ( Kaplan Meier) and a univariate and multivariate analysis of the variables: perirenal fat invasion , sinus fat invasion , renal vein invasion , segmental vein invasion and Fuhrman grade. With a mean follow-up of 79 months , 47 deaths occurred overall ( 31.7 %) , 29 of which were due to the kidney tumor ( CSM 20 %). There were 50 cases of vascular invasion ( 35.7 %) , 40 cases with fat only invasion ( 28.6 %) and 50 cases with invasion of both ( 35.7 %). In the survival study , fat invasion had the least impact ( 17 %) , and invasion of both ( fat and vascular structures) had the worst survival ( 48 % of total mortality). Vascular invasion represents 35 % of the mortality rate. In the multivariate study , Fuhrman grade 3-4 ( HR 10.7) , renal vein invasion ( HR 9.2) and concomitant vascular and fat invasion ( HR 5.6) are the factors with the greatest impact. Tumor fat invasion has a lower impact on the CSM of kidney cancer than vascular invasion.
