  Synapse maturation is a neural activity-dependent process during brain development , in which active synapses preferentially undergo maturation to establish efficient neural circuits in the brain. Defects in this process are implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders. We have previously reported that a postsynaptic transmembrane protein , signal regulatory protein-α ( SIRPα) , plays an important role in activity-dependently directing synapse maturation. In the presence of synaptic activity , the ectodomain of SIRPα is cleaved and released and then acts as a retrograde signal to induce presynaptic maturation. However , how SIRPα detects synaptic activity to promote its ectodomain cleavage and synapse maturation is unknown. Here , we show that activity-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRPα is critical for SIRPα cleavage and synapse maturation. We found that during synapse maturation and in response to neural activity , SIRPα is highly phosphorylated on its tyrosine residues in the hippocampus , a structure critical for learning and memory. Tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRPα was necessary for SIRPα cleavage and presynaptic maturation , as indicated by the fact that a phosphorylation-deficient SIRPα variant underwent much less cleavage and could not drive presynaptic maturation. However , SIRPα phosphorylation did not affect its synaptic localization. Finally , we show that inhibitors of the Src and JAK kinase family suppress neural activity-dependent SIRPα phosphorylation and cleavage. Together , our results indicate that SIRPα phosphorylation serves as a mechanism for detecting synaptic activity and linking it to the ectodomain cleavage of SIRPα , which in turn drives synapse maturation in an activity-dependent manner.
