  Intensive farming practices that implement deep and frequent tillage , high input inorganic fertilization , cultivation with non-host species , and pesticide use are widely reported to be detrimental for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> ( AMF) , which are one of the most important plant biofertilizers. The effect of the reduction of agricultural input on AMF community dynamics following conversion from conventional non-mycorrhizal to lower input mycorrhizal crop cultivation has not yet been fully elucidated. We investigated the effect of the reduction of agricultural input , rotation , and season on AMF communities in winter wheat field soil after conversion from long-term ( more than 20 years) non-mycorrhizal ( sugar beet) crop cultivation. We described AMF communities from bulk soil samples by specifically targeting the 18S ribosomal gene using a combination of AMF specific primers and 454 pyrosequencing. No effect was found after 3 years ' reduction of agricultural input , and only marginal effects were due to rotation with specific crops preceding winter wheat. Instead , season and year of sampling had the most appreciable influence on the AMF community. We suggest that , after conversion from long-term non-mycorrhizal to mycorrhizal crop cultivation , AMF diversity is low if compared to similar agroecosystems. Seasonal and successional dynamics play an important role as determinants of community structure.
