  Diverse animal species perceive Earth 's magnetism and use their magnetic sense to orientate and navigate. Even non-migrating insects such as fruit flies and cockroaches have been shown to exploit the flavoprotein Cryptochrome ( Cry) as a likely magnetic direction sensor; however , the transduction mechanism remains unknown. In order to work as a system to steer insect flight or control locomotion , the magnetic sense must transmit the signal from the receptor cells to the brain at a similar speed to other sensory systems , presumably within hundreds of milliseconds or less. So far , no electrophysiological or behavioral study has tackled the problem of the transduction delay in case of Cry-mediated magnetoreception specifically. Here , using a novel aversive conditioning assay on an American cockroach , we show that magnetic transduction is executed within a sub-second time span. A series of inter-stimulus intervals between conditioned stimuli ( magnetic North rotation) and unconditioned aversive stimuli ( hot air flow) provides original evidence that Cry-mediated magnetic transduction is sufficiently rapid to mediate insect orientation.
