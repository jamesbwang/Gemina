  In recent years CRISPR-Cas technologies have revolutionized microbial engineering approaches. Genome editing and non-editing applications of various CRISPR-Cas systems have expanded the throughput and scale of engineering efforts , as well as opened up new avenues for manipulating genomes of non-model organisms. As we expand the range of organisms used for biotechnological applications , we need to develop better , more versatile tools for manipulation of these systems. Here the authors summarize the current advances in microbial gene editing using CRISPR-Cas based tools and highlight state-of-the-art methods for high-throughput , efficient genome-scale engineering in model organisms Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> The authors also review non-editing CRISPR-Cas applications available for gene expression manipulation , epigenetic remodeling , RNA editing , labeling , and synthetic gene circuit design. Finally , the authors point out the areas of research that need further development in order to expand the range of applications and increase the utility of these new methods.
