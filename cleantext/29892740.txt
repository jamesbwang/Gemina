  Chemoselective and affinity-based probes of steviol were applied to the discovery of glycosyltransferase activity and corresponding UDP-glycosyltransferase in Arabidopsis thaliana , which illustrates a simple strategy for rapidly harnessing minable novel biological parts from plants for synthetic biology.
