  Computer-based analysis of Dopamine transporter imaging ( DaTscan) can aid in image interpretation. In this study , we examined the distribution of putamen-to-caudate ratios ( PCRs) obtained by using a clinically available semiquantification method. Medical records of 32 patients ( M: 16) with a diagnosis of Parkinson 's disease ( PD) ( n = 22) or Parkinson 's plus syndromes<disease> ( PPS) ( n = 10) based on clinical follow-up , were retrospectively reviewed. Single photon emission tomography ( SPECT) imaging was performed 4 hours after intravenous injection of 3-5 mCi ( I-123)- ioflupane. Semiquantitative evaluation using DaTQUANT software was performed. Utility of PCR with a cutoff of .7 and .8 in the diagnosis of nigrostriatal degeneration was assessed. PD and PPS groups based on clinical assessment and caudate-to-background ratio ( CBR) were assessed separately. Minimum PCR for both hemispheres was .74 ± .09 ( Mean ± SD , range: .58-.89) , with 65.63 % patients ( 21/32) having PCR > .7. Mean PCR in mild nigrostriatal degeneration was .77 ± .08 ( range: .62-.89) and in advanced nigrostriatal degeneration was .73 ± .09 ( range: .58-.89). Mean PCR in PD group was .73 ± .09 ( range: .58-.89) and in PPS group was .75 ± .10 ( range: .61-.88). Although PCR can intrinsically be a useful indication of disease , this ratio obtained in our analysis by using one of the clinically available automatic semiquantitative methods has large variability and might not be a reliable numeric marker in interpretation of ( I-123) ioflupane studies. This may be due to difficulty in separating caudate from putamen on SPECT images , as well as the nonuniform decreased Ioflupane uptake in both putamen and caudate.
