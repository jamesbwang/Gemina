  Additional prognostic markers are needed for better treatment stratification of stage II colon cancer ( CC). We investigated the prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs) in a true population-based cohort of patients with stage II CC. A total of 573 patients were included. Tumor blocks representing the deepest invasive part of the primary tumor were used for analysis. CD3 + and CD8 + TILs at the invasive front were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on whole tumor sections. The invasive area was manually outlined , and Visiopharm Integrator System software was used for quantification. Data were dichotomized for comparison with clinical data. The prognostic value was investigated in Cox proportional-hazard models for recurrence-free survival ( RFS) and overall survival ( OS). Low CD3 + or CD8 + TILs were significantly associated with poor RFS and OS ( P = .0021 and P â‰¤ .0009 , respectively , log-rank test). In multiple Cox regression analysis , low CD3 + and CD8 + TILs were associated with reduced RFS with hazard ratio ( HR) = 1.386 ( 95 % CI 1.039-1.850) , P = .026 , and HR = 1.394 ( 95 % CI 1.029-1.890) , P = .032 , respectively , independent of age , T-stage , localization , perforation , and microsatellite instability ( MSI). In the subgroups of patients with low CD3 + or CD8 + TILs , there was no difference in survival between patients with MSI and microsatellite-stable tumors , ( P = .821 and P = .907 , respectively). Low CD3 + and CD8 + TILs in the invasive area are both related to inferior prognosis of stage II CC , and we recommend either of these parameters to be considered as additional high-risk factor.
