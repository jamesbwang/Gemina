  The purpose of this investigation was to compare the efficacy of automatic to manual reposition treatment for patients with horizontal semicircular canal paroxysmal positional vertigo<symptom> ( BPPV). Sixty patients diagnosed with BPPV were equally and randomly divided into either a manual reposition treatment group or an automatic reposition treatment group. The groups were compared regarding difference in pain ( visual analog scale ( VAS)) , extent of vertigo<symptom> disorder ( dizziness<symptom> handicap inventory ( DHI)) , quality of life ( SF-36) , and therapeutic effect. Improved VAS , DHI and SF-36 were observed in both groups , however the efficacious rate of the automatic reposition group ( 96.7 %) was 13.4 % higher than that of the manual reposition group , reaching a statistical significance ( p less than 0.05). In conclusion , in the treatment of BPPV patients , automatic reposition is more effective than manual reposition and can improve the patient 's quality of life.
