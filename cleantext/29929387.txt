  Psychological assessments can be essentially invalidated by examinees ' intentional response styles , such as feigning ( i.e. , fabrication or marked overreporting of symptoms/impairment) and defensiveness ( i.e. , denial or minimization of symptoms/impairment). As a psychometric strength , the Personality Assessment Inventory ( PAI) has established validity indicators for identifying both response styles. With the United States ' increasing ethnic and cultural diversity , predominantly Spanish-speaking individuals are now estimated in the range of 15 million persons. Unfortunately , very little research has been conducted on the Spanish-translated PAI regarding its effectiveness in clinical populations. Using a between-subjects design , a sample of mostly Spanish-speaking outpatients was randomly assigned to genuine , feigning , or defensive conditions. For feigning , PAI malingering indicators using rare symptoms strategies ( i.e. , Negative Impression ( NIM) and Negative Distortion ( NDS) scales) demonstrated moderate to large effect sizes. For defensiveness , the Defensive ( DEF) index proved the most effective with a very large effect size ( M = 1.68). Different cut scores were examined to increase the clinical utility of the Spanish PAI for determining response styles.
