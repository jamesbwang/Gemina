  A manifestation of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is the aggregation in the brain of amyloid β ( Aβ) peptides derived from the amyloid precursor protein ( APP). APP has been linked to modulation of normal copper homeostasis , while dysregulation of Aβ production and clearance has been associated with disruption of copper balance<symptom>. However , quantitative copper chemistry on APP is lacking , in contrast to the plethora of copper chemistry available for Aβ peptides. The soluble extracellular protein domain sAPPα ( molar mass including post-translational modifications of ∼ 100 kDa) has now been isolated in good yield and high quality. It is known to feature several copper binding sites with different affinities. However , under Cu-limiting conditions , it binds either Cu ( I) or Cu ( II) with picomolar affinity at a single site ( labeled M1) that is located within the APP E2 subdomain. M1 in E2 was identified previously by X-ray crystallography as a Cu ( II) site that features four histidine side chains ( H313 , H386 , H432 , and H436) as ligands. The presence of Cu
