  The gait patterns of women with low bone mineral density ( BMD) or osteoporosis have not been thoroughly explored , and when examined , often studied in relation to falls and kyphosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between gait parameters and comfortable , self-selected walking speed and BMD in older post-menopausal women with a broad range of T-scores ( healthy to osteoporotic). 3D kinematic and kinetic data were collected from forty-five women mean ( SD) age 67.3 ( 1.4) years during level walking at their preferred speed. Multiple regression analyses explored the explained variance attributable to speed , femoral neck T-score , and age. The mean ( SD) walking speed 1.40 ( 0.19) m Â· s Speed alone explained most of the variance in the gait parameters , while speed and T-score combined increased the explanatory power of the regression models for some of the knee joint variables. Our findings demonstrated that older post-menopausal women , with a broad range of T-scores , are able to walk at comfortably fast speeds , generating gait patterns similar to those of younger women. The results also suggest that strengthening the hip abductor , knee extensor and flexor muscle groups may benefit the gait patterns of older postmenopausal women with low BMD.
