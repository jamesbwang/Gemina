  Many biomedical research protocols for mouse models involve serial blood collection and analysis. Two common techniques for serial blood collection in this species are the retrobulbar<symptom> ( RB , also called retroorbital) and facial vein ( FV) methods. However , previous studies comparing these methods typically evaluated collection at a maximum of 2 time points. Here we compared hematologic values , adverse clinical effects , and histopathologic lesions<symptom> in mice bled either once or serially ( 6 times) by using the FV or RB method. Mice ( n = 48) were divided into 4 groups: single FV , single RB , serial FV and serial RB. Mice in the single-collection groups underwent a single blood collection by the indicated method , whereas those in the serial-collection groups were sampled once weekly for 6 consecutive weeks. All animals were euthanized and necropsied 2 wk after their last blood collection. Compared with all other groups , the serial FV group experienced more serious clinical adverse events , including 33 % mortality , convulsions<symptom> , head tilt , and hemorrhage<symptom> from the ear canal and nares. In addition , mice in the FV groups had a significantly greater acute body<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom> compared with mice in the RB groups. Histologically , mice in both serial-collection groups had an increased incidence of tissue lesions<symptom> compared with their respective single-collection groups. Importantly , only mice in the serial FV group had life-threatening histopathologic lesions<symptom> , including cerebral hemorrhage<symptom> or ischemia. Given these data , we conclude that serial blood collection in mice causes increased incidence of tissue damage compared with single sampling , and serial blood collection by the FV method causes substantial morbidity and mortality compared with the RB method.
