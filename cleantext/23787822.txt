  To compare the efficacy and safety profiles of sorafenib and apatinib in patients with intermediate- and advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC). This was a single-center , retrospective study where we collected the clinical data of 72 patients , diagnosed with intermediate or advanced HCC from January 2014 to December 2016. Depending on the treatment received , 38 patients were categorized into group S ( sorafenib group) and 34 into group A ( apatinib group). The patients in group A received the initial recommended dose of 750 mg once daily ( QD) , which was reduced to 250 mg QD in the case of any class 3 or 4 adverse event ( AE). Sorafenib was administered orally 400 mg twice daily ( BID) , and dose was modified to 400 mg or 200 mg QD in the case of grade 3 or 4 AEs. The median overall survival ( OS) , progression-free survival ( PFS) , and AEs reported in the two groups were analyzed and compared. Among the 38 patients treated with sorafenib , one patient had complete response ( CR) , 5 patients had partial response ( PR) , and 10 patients had stable disease ( SD) , and among the 34 patients treated with apatinib , 6 patients had PR and 7 patients had SD with no cases of CR. PFS in group S was significantly longer compared with that in group A ( 7.39 vs 4.79 months , respectively , Our study showed promising clinical outcome with apatinib , but the sorafenib group exhibited better clinical efficacy with no significant difference in safety profile.
