  The morphology of the eutectic chromium carbides in the microstructure of as-cast AISI D2 tool steel was modified by adding small amounts of rare-earth elements ( REEs) to the melt. As a result of these REE additions the eutectic carbide morphological type was changed from lamellar to globular. Similar phenomena have already been reported for various tool steels , but no complete theoretical explanation has been provided. Here , we propose a new model that is derived from first-principles thermodynamic calculations based on the phase-field modeling of the eutectic reaction. Using this new approach , where the decomposition of the phase-boundary surface-energy term is divided into the isotropic and anisotropic parts , we were able to account for the transition from a lamellar to a globular eutectic morphology in REE-modified AISI D2 tool steel.
