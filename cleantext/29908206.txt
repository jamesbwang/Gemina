  Porcine proliferative enteritis<disease> is a common diarrheal disease characterized by thickening of the intestinal mucosa in swine due to enterocyte proliferation , which is caused by Lawsonia intracellularis. In this study , a real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP) assay was developed to detect L. intracellularis based on the conserved region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. The optimal reaction conditions of the real-time LAMP was 65 °C for 60 min. The LAMP products could be detected by both real-time turbidity and direct visual inspection. The assay was specific for L. intracellularis , as no cross-reaction was observed with other pathogens. The detection limit of the real-time LAMP assay was 1.4 × 10
