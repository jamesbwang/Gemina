  To identify the molecular profiles of islets from alloxan ( ALX)- and streptozotocin ( STZ)- treated rats , a microarray-based global gene expression analysis was performed on frozen islets isolated via laser capture microdissection. At 6 weeks old , rats were injected with ALX ( 40 mg/kg) or STZ ( 50 or 100 mg/kg) and then euthanized 24 hr later. Histopathological analysis showed β-cell necrosis<symptom> , macrophage infiltration , and islet atrophy. The extent of these changes was more notable in the STZ groups than in the ALX group. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated a significant up- or downregulation of cell cycle arrest-related genes in the p53 signaling pathway. Cyclin D2 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A , mediators of G1 arrest , were remarkably altered in STZ-treated rats. In contrast , cyclin-B1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 , mediators of G2 arrest , were remarkably changed in ALX-treated rats. Genes involved in the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway were upregulated in the ALX and STZ groups. Moreover , heat-shock 70 kDA protein 1A ( Hspa1a) , Hsp90ab1 , and Hsph1 were upregulated in ALX-treated rats , suggesting that ALX treatment injures β cells via endoplasmic reticulum stress. These results contribute to a better understanding of gene expression in the pathogenesis of islet toxicity.
