  New-onset diabetes mellitus ( DM) is one of the first symptoms of pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC). The frequency of endocrine disorders is estimated between 40 % and 80 % in patients with pancreatic cancer. DM is a risk factor for cancer development but it may also be a consequence of the tumor growth. Data confirming the existence of a relationship between long standing type 2 DM and an increased risk of PDAC comes from numerous clinical studies. Insulin resistance phenomenon and hyperinsulinemia may result in the increased proliferation of pancreatic islets which in turn may cause a predisposition to cancer development. In contrast , it is proved that new-onset DM among patients over 50 years old significantly increases the risk of PDAC recognition. Insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1) and their complex proteins , IGF binding proteins , which comprise the IGF axis play a crucial role in carbohydrate metabolism disorders and , studies have shown that they may contribute to PDAC growth. Some studies confirm that IGF-1 is connected with early carcinogenesis in animals and humans. Assessing the levels of these proteins may thus be helpful in early recognition of PDAC in patients with recently detected endocrine disorders , especially pancreatic DM.
