  Studies involving human pharmacological migraine models have predominantly focused on the vasoactive effects of headache-inducing drugs , including sildenafil and calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP). However , the role of possible glutamate level changes in the brainstem and thalamus is of emerging interest in the field of migraine research bringing forth the need for a novel , validated method to study the biochemical effects in these areas. We applied an optimized in vivo human pharmacological proton ( The glutamate levels increased transiently in the brainstem at 40-70 min after sildenafil administration compared to placebo ( 5.6 % , P = 0.039). We found no sildenafil-induced glutamate changes in the thalamus , and no CGRP-induced glutamate changes in the brainstem or thalamus compared to placebo. Both sildenafil and CGRP induced headache<symptom> in 53 % -62 % of participants. We found no interaction in the glutamate levels in the brainstem or thalamus between participants who developed sildenafil and/or CGRP-induced headache<symptom> as compared to participants who did not. The transient sildenafil-induced glutamate change in the brainstem possibly reflects increased excitability of the brainstem neurons. CGRP did not induce brainstem or thalamic glutamate changes , suggesting that it rather exerts its headache-inducing effects on the peripheral trigeminal pain pathways.
