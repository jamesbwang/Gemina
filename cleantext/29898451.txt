  Circadian rhythm alterations resulting in disturbed sleep and disturbed melatonin secretion are flagship features of depression<symptom> Melatonin , known as a hormone of darkness , is secreted by the pineal gland located near to the center of the brain between the two hemispheres. Melatonin has an antidepressant effect by maintaining the body 's circadian rhythm , by regulating the pattern of expression of the clock genes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN) and modifying the key genes of serotoninergic neurotransmission that are linked with a depressive mood. Melatonin is produced via the metabolism of serotonin in two steps which are catalyzed by serotonin N-acetyltransferase ( SNAT) and acetylserotonin-O-methyltransferase ( ASMT). Serotonin , SNAT , and ASMT are key melatonin level regulation factors. Melatonin acts mainly on the MT1 and MT2 receptors , which are present in the SCN , to regulate physiological and neuroendocrine functions including circadian entrainment , referred to as a chronobiotic effect. Although melatonin has been known about and refereed to for almost 50 years , the relationship between melatonin and depression<symptom> is still not clear. In this review , we summarize current knowledge about the genetic and epigenetic regulation of enzymes involved in melatonin synthesis and metabolism as potential features of depression<symptom> pathophysiology and treatment. Confirmation that melatonin metabolism in peripheral blood partially reflects a disorder in the brain could be a breakthrough in the standardization of measurements of melatonin level for the development of treatment standards , finding new therapeutic targets , and elaborating simple noninvasive clinical tests.
