  Fat malabsorption is common after SBT. To identify whether anatomic variant transplants differ in occurrence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency that could contribute to fat malabsorption , we measured FPE repeatedly in 54 recipients of a SBT , ages 6.2 to 320 months. FPE determination most distant from SBT was 6.1 years. Of the 54 , 39 % received an isolated intestinal graft ( native pancreas only) , 48 % received an en bloc liver-intestinal-pancreas graft ( native and graft pancreas) , and 13 % received a multivisceral graft ( graft pancreas only). Initial FPE was normal ( > 200 Î¼g/g) in 15 of the 54 at a median of 22 ( 11-61) days after SBT. Recipients of a liver-intestine-pancreas transplant were more likely to have normal FPE within 30 days after SBT than were isolated intestinal or multivisceral transplant recipients ( 47 % , 19 % , and 0 % , respectively , P = .049). Of the remaining 39 patients , 34 eventually demonstrated a normal FPE at a median of 168 ( 31-943) days after SBT. Type of SBT did not influence the likelihood of achieving a normal FPE level or time when it occurred. Five ( 9 %) patients failed to achieve normal FPE , including 3 who died within 2 years after SBT. In conclusion , possessing both graft and native pancreas as in transplantation of an en bloc liver-intestinal-pancreas graft facilitates early normalization of FPE that eventually occurs in most patients irrespective of transplant type. Failure to recover normal pancreatic function may be associated with severe post-transplant complications.
