  In recent years , targeting the complex network of protein ‚Åª protein interactions ( PPIs) has been identified as a promising drug-discovery approach to develop new therapeutic strategies. 14-3-3 is a family of eukaryotic conserved regulatory proteins which are of high interest as potential targets for pharmacological intervention in human<disease> diseases<disease> , such as cancer and neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders. This viewpoint is built on the & ldquo; hub & rdquo; nature of the 14-3-3 proteins , binding to several hundred identified partners , consequently implicating them in a multitude of different cellular mechanisms. In this review , we provide an overview of the structural and biological features of 14-3-3 and the modulation of 14-3-3 PPIs for discovering small molecular inhibitors and stabilizers of 14-3-3 PPIs.
