  Advances in three-dimensional ( 3D) printing have increased feasibility towards the synthesis of living tissues. Known as 3D bioprinting , this technology involves the precise layering of cells , biologic scaffolds , and growth factors with the goal of creating bioidentical tissue for a variety of uses. Early successes have demonstrated distinct advantages over conventional tissue engineering strategies. Not surprisingly , there are current challenges to address before 3D bioprinting becomes clinically relevant. Here we provide an overview of 3D bioprinting technology and discuss key advances , clinical applications , and current limitations. While 3D bioprinting is a relatively novel tissue engineering strategy , it holds great potential to play a key role in personalized medicine.
