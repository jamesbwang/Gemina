  Inspecting the olfactory cleft can be of high interest , as it is an open access to neurons , and thus an opportunity to collect in situ related data in a non-invasive way. Also , recent studies show a strong link between olfactory deficiency and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. However , no inspection of this area is possible today , as it is very difficult to access. Only robot-assisted interventions seem viable to provide the required dexterity. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated in this article , which shows that the path complexity to the olfactory cleft can be managed with a concentric tube robot ( CTR) , a particular type of continuum robot. First , new anatomical data are elaborated , in particular for the olfactory cleft , that remains hardly characterized. 3D reconstructions are conducted on the database of 20 subjects , using CT scan images. Measurements are performed to describe the anatomy , including metrics with inter-subject variability. Then , the existence of collision-free passageways for CTR is shown using the 3D reconstructions. Among the 20 subjects , 19 can be inspected using only 3 different robot geometries. This constitutes an essential step towards a robotic device to inspect subjects for clinical purposes.
