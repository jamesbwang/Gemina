  Simultaneous application of solar photo-Fenton and ozonation ( SPFO) for the efficient treatment of real wastewaters was studied. Four different industrial effluents were selected for the study: landfill leachate , pharmaceutical effluent and two textile wastewaters , in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed technology. SPFO performance was compared with individual processes ( either solar photo-Fenton or ozonation) , as well as the hybrid Fenton and ozonation treatment. In highly polluted wastewaters , combined strategies led to higher organic matter removal than O
