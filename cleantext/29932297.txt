  Previous articles explored the role of UGT1A1 polymorphism on predicting irinotecan-induced toxicity , but the conclusions were still inconsistent and not comprehensive. We performed this meta-analysis to investigate the association between UGT1A1 polymorphism and irinotecan-induced toxicity. PubMed and Web of Science were searched for articles before July 2017. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were set to select eligible articles , and corresponding data were extracted from those articles. Subgroup analyses based on different cancer categories , doses and races were carried out to achieve comprehensive results. Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA 11.0. A total of 38 studies with 6742 cases were included after reading full text. Both UGT1A1 * 6 and UGT1A1 * 28 polymorphism are significantly associated with severe irinotecan-induced toxicity. Both Asian and Caucasian cancer patients with UGT1A1 * 28 variant had an increased risk. Compared with heterozygous variant , patients with homozygous variant suffered from a higher risk of toxicity. The effect of UGT1A1 * 28 polymorphism on diarrhea<disease> was less than on neutropenia. Subgroup analysis exhibited that for UGT1A1 * 6 polymorphism , patients treated with low-dose irinotecan were at a notable risk of toxicity. Moreover , the association between UGT1A1 * 6 polymorphism and irinotecan-induced toxicity was found in patients suffering from respiratory system cancers. Both UGT1A1 * 6 and UGT1A1 * 28 polymorphisms can be considered as predictors of irinotecan-induced toxicity , with effect varying by race , cancer type and irinotecan dose.
