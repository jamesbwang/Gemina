  Semiconductor materials have been shown to have good photocatalytic behavior and can be utilized for the photodegradation of organic pollutants. In this work , three-dimensional flower-like SnS ₂ ( tin sulfide) was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. Core-shell structured SiO ₂ @ & alpha;- Fe ₂ O ₃ nanocomposites were then deposited on the top of the SnS ₂ flowers. The as-synthesized nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , Raman spectroscopy , field emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE-SEM) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) , X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) , UV ⁻ Vis Spectroscopy , Brunauer ⁻ Emmett ⁻ Teller ( BET) surface area analysis , and photoluminescence ( PL) spectroscopy. The photocatalytic behavior of the SnS ₂- SiO ₂ @ & alpha;- Fe ₂ O ₃ nanocomposites was investigated by observing the degradation of methylene blue ( MB). The results show an effective enhancement of photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB especially for the 15 wt % SiO ₂ @ & alpha;- Fe ₂ O ₃ nanocomposites on SnS ₂ flowers.
