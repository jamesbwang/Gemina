  Neural stem cells ( NSCs) are a prominent cell source for understanding neural pathogenesis and for developing therapeutic applications to treat neurodegenerative disease because of their regenerative capacity and multipotency. Recently , a variety of cellular reprogramming technologies have been developed to facilitate in vitro generation of NSCs , called induced NSCs ( iNSCs). However , the genetic safety aspects of established virus-based reprogramming methods have been considered , and non-integrating reprogramming methods have been developed. Reprogramming with in vitro transcribed ( IVT) mRNA is one of the genetically safe reprogramming methods because exogenous mRNA temporally exists in the cell and is not integrated into the chromosome. Here , we successfully generated expandable iNSCs from human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( UCB-MSCs) via transfection with IVT mRNA encoding SOX2 ( SOX2 mRNA) with properly optimized conditions. We confirmed that generated human UCB-MSC-derived iNSCs ( UM-iNSCs) possess characteristics of NSCs , including multipotency and self-renewal capacity. Additionally , we transfected human dermal fibroblasts ( HDFs) with SOX2 mRNA. Compared with human embryonic stem cell-derived NSCs , HDFs transfected with SOX2 mRNA exhibited neural reprogramming with similar morphologies and NSC-enriched mRNA levels , but they showed limited proliferation ability. Our results demonstrated that human UCB-MSCs can be used for direct reprogramming into NSCs through transfection with IVT mRNA encoding a single factor , which provides an integration-free reprogramming tool for future therapeutic application.
