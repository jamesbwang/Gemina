  Nonlinear optical frequency conversion has been challenged to move down to the extreme ultraviolet and x-ray region. However , the extremely low signals have allowed researchers to only perform transmission experiments of the gas phase or ultrathin films. Here , we report second harmonic generation ( SHG) of the reflected beam of a soft x-ray free-electron laser from a solid , which is enhanced by the resonant effect. The observation revealed that the double resonance condition can be met by absorption edges for transition metal oxides in the soft x-ray range , and this suggests that the resonant SHG technique can be applicable to a wide range of materials. We discuss the possibility of element-selective SHG spectroscopy measurements in the soft x-ray range.
