  We conducted a case study to examine the feasibility and safety of high-intensity interval training ( HIIT) with increased inspired oxygen content in a colon cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy. A secondary purpose was to investigate the effects of such training regimen on physical functioning. A female patient ( 51 years; 49.1 kg; 1.65 m; tumor stage: pT3 , pN2a ( 5/29) , pM1a ( HEP) , L0 , V0 , R0) performed 8 sessions of HIIT ( 5 × 3 minutes at 90 % of Wmax , separated by 2 minutes at 45 % Wmax) with an increased inspired oxygen fraction of 30 %. Patient safety , training adherence , cardiorespiratory fitness ( peak oxygen uptake and maximal power output during an incremental cycle ergometer test) , autonomous nervous function ( i.e. , heart rate variability during an orthostatic test) as well as questionnaire-assessed quality of life ( EORTC QLQ-C30) were evaluated before and after the intervention.No adverse events were reported throughout the training intervention and a 3 months follow-up. While the patient attended all sessions , adherence to total training time was only 51 % ( 102 of 200 minutes; mean training time per session 12:44 min: sec). VO2peak and Wmax increased by 13 % ( from 23.0 to 26.1 mL min kg) and 21 % ( from 83 to 100 W) , respectively. Heart rate variability represented by the root mean squares of successive differences both in supine and upright positions were increased after the training by 143 and 100 % , respectively. The EORTC QLQ-C30 score for physical functioning ( 7.5 %) as well as the global health score ( 10.7 %) improved , while social function decreased ( 17 %). Our results show that a already short period of HIIT with concomitant hyperoxia was safe and feasible for a patient undergoing chemotherapy for colon cancer. Furthermore , the low overall training adherence of only 51 % and an overall low training time per session ( ∼ 13 minutes) was sufficient to induce clinically meaningful improvements in physical functioning. However , this case also underlines that intensity and/or length of the HIIT-bouts might need further adjustments to increase training compliance.
