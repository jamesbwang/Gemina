  The scientific evidence supporting pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR) for lung cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy is accumulating; however , the feasibility of outpatient-based PR in these patients has not yet been evaluated in Korea. We conducted an eight-week outpatient-based PR feasibility study in a tertiary referral hospital setting. Patients with advanced lung cancer ( non-small cell lung cancer IIIB-IV and small-cell lung cancer extensive disease) scheduled to undergo first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy underwent PR consisting of 60-minute sessions twice a week under the guidance and supervision of a physical therapist , for a total of eight weeks. Feasibility was assessed based on completion of the PR program. In total , 12 patients ( median age 68 years) were enrolled; 11 ( 91.7 %) were male with a history of smoking. Among these 12 patients , 9 ( 75 %) completed the eight-week outpatient-based PR program. Three patients could not complete the PR program: two were unwilling and one died from complications of lung cancer. This study showed a 75 % completion rate of an eight-week outpatient-based PR program for advanced lung cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy , which supports its feasibility.
