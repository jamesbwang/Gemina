  Tongue squamous carcinoma can be found in many forms , having a lot of risk factors , and whose morphological characteristics can be used as a prognostic. The purpose of this study was to histologically characterize a number of 54 patients diagnosed between 2012-2014 , with tongue squamous carcinoma. Surgical resection specimens of tongue tumors were processed by paraffin inclusion technique. The diagnose samples were reevaluated according to the World Health Organization ( WHO) criteria for head and neck tumors diagnosis , by screening the Hematoxylin-Eosin staining sections. The most common histopathological variety of tongue carcinoma observed in our cases was the non-keratinized form , the basaloid and sarcomatoid types of carcinoma being ranked on the last places. The study outlined the prevalence of non-keratinized forms of tongue squamous carcinoma and all types of tumoral invasion patterns have been observed in different percentages.
