  Although various surgical procedures have been developed for chronic rotator cuff tear repair , the re-tear rate remains high with severe fat infiltration. However , little is known about the molecular regulation of this process. Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) in the intra-muscular space are origin of ectopic fat cells in skeletal muscle. We have previously shown that high-mobility group box 2 ( HMGB2) , which is a nuclear protein commonly associated with mesenchymal differentiation , is involved in the early articular cartilage degeneration. In this study , we addressed the role of HMGB2 in adipogenesis of MSCs and fat infiltration into skeletal muscles. HMGB2 was highly expressed in undifferentiated MSCs and co-localized with platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î± ( PDGFRA) known as an MSC-specific marker , while their expressions were decreased during adipocytic differentiation. Under the deficiency of HMGB2 , the expressions of adipogenesis-related molecules were reduced , and adipogenic differentiation is substantially impaired in MSCs. Moreover , HMGB2
