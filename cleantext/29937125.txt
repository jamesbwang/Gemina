  Duration of therapy time is an inadequate indicator of stroke rehabilitation. Steps , duration , and intensity of active therapy time may provide a better indicator of practice. This study quantified usual walking practice in terms of steps , duration and intensity of active therapy time , and distance walked during physical therapy sessions in people with sub-acute stroke undertaking inpatient rehabilitation and to examine whether usual walking practice differed depending on walking ability. A prospective observational study was conducted across two metropolitan rehabilitation units in Australia. Twenty-four stroke survivors were observed over three physical therapy sessions. Walking ability was categorized as unassisted or assisted based on Item 5 of the Motor Assessment Scale. Walking practice was categorized as basic or advanced. Steps , duration , intensity and distance walked were measured during physical therapy sessions. Overall , participants took 560 steps ( SD 309) over 13 min ( SD 6) at an intensity of steps 44 steps/min ( SD 17) and walked 222m ( SD 143) in physical therapy. Unassisted walkers ( n = 6 , 25 %) undertook more ( or trended towards more) practice of advanced walking than assisted walkers in terms of steps ( MD 254 steps , 95 % CI 48-462) , duration ( MD 5 min , 95 % CI 0-10) , intensity ( MD 18steps/min , 95 % CI -8 to 44) and distance ( MD 112m , 95 % CI -12 to 236). Stroke survivors undergoing inpatient rehabilitation spent approximately 20 % of physical therapy actively engaged in walking practice. Those able to walk without assistance took more steps for longer , at a higher intensity. ACTRN12613000764730 ( https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=364545).
