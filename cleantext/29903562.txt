  Imaging of hard and soft tissue of the oral cavity is important for dentistry. However , medical computed tomography , cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT) , nor MRI enables soft and hard tissue imaging simultaneously. Some MRI sequences were shown to provide fast soft and hard tissue imaging of hydrogen , which increased the interest in dental MRI. Recently , MRI allowed direct visualization of cancellous bone , intraoral mucosa , and dental pulp despite that cortical bone and dental roots are indirectly visualized. MRI seems to be adequate for many indications that CBCT is currently used for: implant treatment and inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> of the tooth.
