  This papers aims to verify to what extent the presentation of a restaurant dish and the origin of its food provoke reactions in the consumer 's brain during the visualization and the decision-making process , from an exploratory approach. The two independent variables singled out for study were whether the presentation was well or poorly presented and if the ingredients were ecological or non-ecological. The results applying the functional magnetic resonance image ( fMRI) methodology reveal that well-presented dishes activate areas in the brain linked to the network of emotions indicating that the visualization in restaurant menus is not a purely cognitive and self-reflexive process but retains a strong affective component. Furthermore , the presence of this component is kept at the moment of choosing a dish , as observed by the activation of the cingulate gyrus , region linked to the regulatory processes of emotions. Hence , research ratifies the existence of an emotional factor during the entire process of decision-making carried out in a restaurant. Yet it is true that exposure to an ecological menu provokes activation of the medial frontal cortex , a region connected to higher reasoning and attention , suggesting that stimuli from well-presented dishes of ecological origin trigger neuronal responses related to high-level cognitive processes. The practical implications derived , along with its limitations and the future research opportunities , are interesting for both developing theory and also practice. Therefore , scholars are encouraged to further test some research proposals ( e.g. moderating role of salubrity or simultaneously eye tracking method).
