  An 8-year-old , spayed female , domestic short haired cat , with diabetes mellitus , was presented to the University of Florida Veterinary Medical Center for an acute onset of vomiting and inappetence. Abdominal radiographs showed mild retroperitoneal effusion<symptom> and asymmetric left-sided renomegaly. Subsequently , on abdominal ultrasound , a hypoechoic left ureteral mass with left hydronephrosis and hydroureter was identified. An abdominal computed tomography revealed a heterogeneously contrast-enhancing mass circumferentially surrounding the mid to distal left ureter , mild retroperitoneal effusion<symptom> , left-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter , and a distally located ureteral calculus at the level of the ureterovesicular junction. The patient was diagnosed with left-sided pyogranulomatous ureteritis via surgical biopsy and histopathology.
