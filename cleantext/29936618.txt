  Portal hypertension ( PHT) due to extrahepatic portal venous obstruction ( EHPVO) is common in developing countries. Hypersplenism is a near-constant feature of EHPVO , but its significance , unlike in cirrhotics , is unknown. We aimed to study the relationship between hypersplenism and the severity of PHT in patients with EHPVO. This prospective study was done at a tertiary care center from January 2014 to August 2015. All patients with EHPVO who underwent a splenectomy and a shunt or devascularization were included. Data regarding clinical profile , preoperative parameters , and intraoperative details were recorded. The correlation was studied between hypersplenism and the intraoperatively measured portal pressures and markers of PHT. Of the 40 patients studied ( mean ( SD) age 22.4 ( 8.4) years) , hematological hypersplenism was present in 39 ( 97.5 %). The mean ( SD) hemoglobin , total leukocyte counts ( TLC) , and platelet counts were 9.9 ( 2.4) g/dL , 2971 ( 1239) cells/mm The platelet counts showed a significant inverse correlation with portal pressures in patients with EHPVO and may be used as surrogate markers of PHT. A platelet count â‰¤ 53,500 cells/mm
