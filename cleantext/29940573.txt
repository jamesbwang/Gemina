  In this study , we examined multiple sclerosis ( MS) point prevalence in the well-defined island<disease> population of Iceland. This study included all registered residents of Iceland with MS on the prevalence day , December 31 , 2007. All included patients met at least one of the following criteria: McDonald criteria; Poser criteria for clinically definite MS , laboratory-supported definite MS , clinically probable MS; or criteria for primary progressive MS. The patients ' medical records were reviewed , including all available MRI data acquired prior to the prevalence day. We identified 526 patients , of whom 73 % ( 382) were women. The crude point prevalence of MS was 167.1 per 100,000 population on the prevalence day. With age adjustment made to the 2000 U.S. population , the prevalence was 166.5 per 100,000 population. The mean patient age on the prevalence day was 47 years ( range 13-89) for both men and women. The mean age at diagnosis was 36 years ( range 13-77): 35 years for women and 36 years for men. MS prevalence was high in Iceland compared to the prevalence mentioned in reports from most of the world , and was similar to prevalence rates in other Nordic countries.
