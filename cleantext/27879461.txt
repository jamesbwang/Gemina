  The interoceanic highway ( IOH) in Madre de Dios , Peru has driven dramatic change in the Peruvian Amazon basin. We conducted a mixed methods study to examine the impact of these changes on the subjective well-being ( SWB) of four communities on the IOH. Themes that emerged qualitatively included changing health threats , environmental degradation , and the impact of increased migration. To achieve a higher level of SWB , respondents emphasized the need for higher incomes , opportunities to learn new skills , and a better education for their children. Potential threats to SWB included marital problems and poorer health. Quantitative analyses suggested that social support and a sense of security impacted reported SWB scores based on life satisfaction , and the impact of income on life satisfaction was mediated by food security. Although long-term residents felt that specific determinants of SWB had both increased ( food variety , transport and access to work) and decreased ( access to natural resources and hunting) , the majority reported that their lives had improved overall. Health had been affected by the IOH in both negative ways ( increased dengue<disease> and road accidents) and positive ways ( improved access to health services). Our results suggest that the rapidly-changing communities near the IOH link well-being to health , income , community , and the environment.
