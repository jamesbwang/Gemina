  Kissing during late adolescence and the transition to adulthood is prevalent , relatively frequent , and distinct from many sexual behaviors in that it affords positive consequences with minimal risk. In this study , we examined within-person associations between kissing and day-to-day variation in affect. A racially/ethnically diverse sample of college students ( N = 560; 54.1 % female) completed up to 14 daily surveys for seven consecutive semesters. On days when students kissed , they reported more positive and less negative affect than on other days , after controlling for a number of known correlates. Findings differed at the semester- and person levels. Findings contribute to a normative developmental understanding of sexual behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood.
