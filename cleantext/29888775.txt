  This review summarizes the isolation , chemical identification , and biochemical activities of Camellia triterpenoid saponins , updating a previous review and encompassing all new studies through September 2017. Further , molecular simulations of the interaction between several known cytotoxic oleiferasaponin monomers and Interleukin-6 are discussed , demonstrating that molecular modeling is a convenient method to obtain structure-activity information.
