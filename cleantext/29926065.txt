  Salidroside is the major bioactive component of Rhodiola sachalinensis. Studies have shown that salidroside has anti-inflammatory effects. In the present study , we examined whether salidroside inhibited inflammatory reaction in BV-2 microglial cells and thereby inhibited PC12 apoptosis. BV-2 cells were induced by lipopolysaccharides ( LPS , 100 μg/L) and/or salidroside ( 10 mg/L) , and then the conditioned medium was collected. Real time-PCR was used to detect IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA expression. The contents of IL-6 and TNF-α in medium were detected by ELSIA. Conditioned medium was added to PC12 culture medium and cell counting kit-8 and Hoechst 33258 were used to assess cell viability and cell apoptosis , respectively , after 24 h of incubation. The levels of phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( p-p38) and phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( p-JNK) in BV-2 cells were examined by Western blot analysis. The result showed that salidroside pretreatment decreased the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α as well as phosphorylation of p38 and JNK induced by LPS in BV-2 cells. The inhibitors of p38 ( SB202190) and JNK ( SP600125) could reduce IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA expression that was induced by LPS. Combined utilization of SB202190 , SP600125 and salidroside could attenuate the effects of LPS. After conditioned medium treatment , PC12 cell viability and cell apoptosis were ameliorated in pretreatment + LPS group compared with LPS group. These results suggest that salidroside inhibits PC12 cell apoptosis by decreasing inflammatory factor release as well as p38 and JNK activation in activated microglia.
