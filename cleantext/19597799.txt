  A previous report showed that a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor ( GLP-1R) agonist ( exenatide) induced apoptosis in endometrial cancer cells. However , the pathophysiological role of GLP-1R in endometrial cancer has not been fully elucidated. Here , we investigated the effects of the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide in endometrial cancer cells and examined the association between GLP-1R expression and clinicopathological characteristics in endometrial cancer patients. Human Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of liraglutide. To assess the effects of liraglutide , cell viability , colony formation , flow cytometry , Western blotting , and immunofluorescence assays were performed. Autophagy induction was examined by analyzing LC3 and p62 expression and autophagosome accumulation. Moreover , using a tissue microarray , we analyzed GLP-1R expression in 154 endometrial cancer tissue samples by immunohistochemistry. In accordance with the previous report , liraglutide inhibited Ishikawa cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. Liraglutide significantly induced autophagy , and phosphorylated AMPK expression was elevated. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that GLP-1R expression was associated with positive estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status , and higher GLP-1R expression was significantly correlated with better progression-free survival. The use of liraglutide to target autophagy in endometrial cancer cells may be a novel potential treatment for endometrial cancer. Furthermore , higher GLP-1R expression may be associated with better prognosis in endometrial cancer patients.
