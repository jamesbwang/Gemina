  This meta-analysis compared progressive aerobic training ( PAT) to progressive resistance training ( PRT) for pain , disability and quality of life ( QoL) in people with chronic non-specific low back pain ( CNSLBP). Five electronic databases were systematically searched up to 1 March 2016. Randomised controlled trials included land-based PAT , PRT or combined PRT and PAT , versus usual care for CNSLBP. Exercise interventions were supervised a minimum of once per week and performed ⩾ 2 days/week for ⩾ 6 weeks. Outcome measurements were pain intensity , disability , and QoL. Standardised mean difference ( SMD) and mean difference ( MD) were calculated using Review Manager 5.3. Six studies were included , comprising 333 participants ( 94 PRT , 93 PAT , 146 usual care; 66 % female; age = 44 ± 6 years; duration of pain = 7 ± 6 years). Exercise significantly reduced pain intensity ( SMD = -0.42 ( -0.80 , -0.03); p < 0.03) although neither mode proved superior. PRT significantly improved the Short Form Health Survey-Mental Component Score ( SF-MCS) ( MD = 5.74 ( 2.02 , 9.47); p = 0.002). PAT and PRT decreased pain intensity in individuals with CNSLBP although neither mode was superior. Resistance exercise improved psychological wellbeing. High-quality RCTs comparing PAT , PRT , and PAT + PRT , are required.
