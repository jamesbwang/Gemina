  The optimal management of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer remains under debate. We aimed to compare the long-term survival outcomes between definitive chemoradiation ( dCR) and chemoradiation plus surgery ( CRS) in patients with stage III esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC). Using the National Cancer Institute Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results ( SEER) Program registry , adults ( â‰¥ 18 years old) with diagnosis of AJCC 6th edition stage III EAC ( T3/N1 , T4/N0 , and T4/N1) between 2004 and 2014 were included. A multivariable Cox regression was used to assess the effect of dCR and CRS on mortality. Of the 2633 patients included , 1115 ( 42 %) underwent Dcr , and 1518 ( 58 %) underwent CRS. The 5-year survival rate was 13 % for patients undergoing dCR and 27 % for patients undergoing CRS ( p < 0.0001). Our observational data suggest that patients with stage III EAC may benefit by the use of esophagectomy after chemoradiotherapy.
