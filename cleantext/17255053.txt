  This study applied the kriging model and particle swarm optimization ( PSO) algorithm for the dynamic model updating of bridge structures using the higher vibration modes under large-amplitude initial conditions. After addressing the higher mode identification theory using time-domain operational modal analysis , the kriging model is then established based on Latin hypercube sampling and regression analysis. The kriging model performs as a surrogate model for a complex finite element model in order to predict analytical responses. An objective function is established to express the relative difference between analytically predicted responses and experimentally measured ones , and the initial finite element ( FE) model is hereinafter updated using the PSO algorithm. The Jal&oacute;n viaduct-- a concrete continuous railway bridge-- is applied to verify the proposed approach. The results show that the kriging model can accurately predict the responses and reduce computational time as well.
