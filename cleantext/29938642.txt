  A 33-year-old man was admitted to hospital with a butter knife stuck in his head after having attempted to commit suicide by forcing the knife through his skull. Physical examination revealed a stable patient with only minimal associated haemorrhage. A CT scan revealed , that the penetrating knife had passed through the sphenoid bone , the posterior orbit and the ethmoid cells and ended in the contralateral nasal cavity. The knife was removed by its own trajectory. After surgery , the patient was neurologically intact with normal sight and well-functioning eye movements<symptom> , and he made a full recovery.
