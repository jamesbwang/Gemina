  ALK gene rearrangements have been described in spitzoid lesions<symptom> with plexiform growth pattern. To investigate the prevalence of ALK alterations in a large series of spitzoid lesions<symptom>. ALK immunohistochemical and FISH analyses on 78 spitzoid plexiform lesions<symptom>: 41 Spitz nevi ( SN) , 29 atypical Spitz tumors ( ASTs) , and 8 spitzoid melanomas ( SMs). ALK immunohistochemical staining was observed in 14.6 % ( 6/41) SNs and 13.8 % ( 4/29) ASTs; SMs were ALK negative. FISH confirmed ALK translocation in 9 cases and amplification in 1 case. In two of the translocated cases it was possible to determine the fusion partner gene ( i.e. TPM3 and DCTN1). Two out of 4 ASTs cases examined , carried the BRAF BRAF status was tested only in 4/10 samples due to the limited amount of material. ALK alterations characterize a significant subset of spitzoid
