  Functional depletion of the alternative splicing factors Muscleblind-like ( MBNL 1 and 2) is at the basis of the neuromuscular disease myotonic dystrophy type 1 ( DM1). We previously showed the efficacy of miRNA downregulation in Drosophila DM1 model. Here , we screen for miRNAs that regulate MBNL1 and MBNL2 in HeLa cells. We thus identify miR-23b and miR-218 , and confirm that they downregulate MBNL proteins in this cell line. Antagonists of miR-23b and miR-218 miRNAs enhance MBNL protein levels and rescue pathogenic missplicing events in DM1 myoblasts. Systemic delivery of these `` antagomiRs '' similarly boost MBNL expression and improve DM1-like phenotypes , including splicing alterations , histopathology , and myotonia in the HSA
