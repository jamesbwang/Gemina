  Usher syndrome<symptom> is the most common cause of deafness associated with visual loss of a genetic origin. The purpose of this paper is to report very severe phenotypic features of type 1B Usher syndrome<symptom> in a Saudi family affected by positive homozygous splice site mutation Affected siblings went through detailed history. Complete ophthalmic examination was done. Imaging with colour fundus photography , fundus autofluorescence ( AF) , and optical coherence tomography ( OCT) scans was performed. Full field electroretinogram ( ffERG) was recorded. Molecular genetic testing was done using next-generation sequencing. Visual acuity was more reduced ( range 20/300- 20/40) in older siblings ( age > 30 years) , than in younger ( age < 30 years) siblings ( range 20/70-20/ 25). OCT scans showed macular atrophy in all but one case that has cystoid macular edema<symptom> ( CME). AF demonstrated atrophy outside a small foveal area showing high signal. FfERG was flat in all cases. The homozygous splice site mutation c. 470 +1 G > A in intron 5 of the This mutation manifested with advanced retinal degeneration at a young age. This may have implications regarding future gene therapy in Usher syndrome<symptom> cases with this genotype.
