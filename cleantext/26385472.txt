  Nursing homes are often places where older persons & ldquo; come to die. & rdquo; Despite this , death and dying are seldom articulated or talked about. The aim of this study was to explore assistant nurses & rsquo; experiences of conversations about death and dying with nursing home residents. This study is part of an implementation project through a knowledge-based educational intervention based on palliative care principles. An ethnographic study design was applied in seven nursing homes , where eight assistant nurses were interviewed and followed in their daily assignments through participant observations. The assistant nurses stated that they had the knowledge and tools to conduct such conversations , even though they lacked the time and felt that emotional strain could be a hinder for conversations about death and dying. The assistant nurses used the strategies of distracting , comforting , and disregarding either when they perceived that residents & rsquo; reflections on death and dying were part of their illness and disease or when there was a lack of alignment between the residents & rsquo; contemplations and the concept of dying well. They indicated that ambivalence and ambiguity toward conversations about death and dying should be taken into consideration in future implementations of knowledge-based palliative care that take place in nursing homes after this project is finalized.
