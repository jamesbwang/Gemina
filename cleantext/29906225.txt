  Numerous physiological and pathological events , from organ development to cancer and fibrosis<disease> , are characterized by Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition ( EMT) , whereby adherent epithelial cells convert to migratory mesenchymal cells. During cardiac development , pro-epicardial organ epithelial cells undergo EMT to generate fibroblasts. Subsequent stress or damage induces further phenotype conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts , causing fibrosis<disease> via synthesis of excessive extracellular matrix. We previously showed that the transcription factor scleraxis is both sufficient and necessary for the conversion of cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts , and found that scleraxis knockout reduced cardiac fibroblast number by 50 % , possibly via EMT attenuation. Scleraxis induced expression of the EMT transcriptional regulators Twist1 and Snai1 via an unknown mechanism. Here , we report that scleraxis binds to E-box consensus sequences within the Twist1 and Snai1 promoters to directly transactivate these genes. Scleraxis up-regulates expression of both genes in A549 epithelial cells and in cardiac proto-myofibroblasts. Transforming Growth Factor β ( TGFβ) induces EMT , fibrosis<disease> and scleraxis expression , and we found that TGFβ-mediated up-regulation of Twist1 and Snai1 completely depends upon the presence of scleraxis. Snai1 knockdown up-regulated the epithelial marker E-cadherin , however this effect was lost following scleraxis over-expression , suggesting that scleraxis may repress E-cadherin expression. Together , these results indicate that scleraxis can regulate EMT via direct transactivation of the Twist1 and Snai1 genes. Given the role of scleraxis in also driving the myofibroblast phenotype , scleraxis appears to be a critical controller of fibroblast genesis and fate in the myocardium , and thus may play key roles in wound<disease> healing and
