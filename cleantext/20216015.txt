  Sleep-disordered breathing is common in individuals with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and may contribute to changes in the brain and decreased cognition. However , limited research has explored how the apnea-hypopnea index contributes to brain structure and cognition in this population. The aims of this study were to explore how the apnea-hypopnea index is associated with brain volume and cognition in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients. Data of 28 heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients ( mean age = 67.93; SD = 5.78) were analyzed for this cross-sectional observational study. We evaluated the apnea-hypopnea index using a portable multichannel sleep-monitoring device. All participants were scanned using 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological tests. Brain volume was evaluated using a voxel-based morphometry method with T1-weighted images. We used multiple regressions to analyze how the apnea-hypopnea index is associated with brain volume and cognition. We found an inverse association between apnea-hypopnea index scores and white matter volume ( β = -0.002 , p = 0.026) , but not in gray matter volume ( β = -0.001 , p = 0.237). Higher apnea-hypopnea index was associated with reduced regional gray and white matter volume ( p < 0.001 , uncorrected). Cognitive scores were not associated with the apnea-hypopnea index ( p-values were > 0.05). Findings from this study provide exploratory evidence that higher apnea-hypopnea index may be associated with greater brain volume reduction in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients. Future studies are needed to establish the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing , brain volume , and cognition in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> samples.
