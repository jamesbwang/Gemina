  Lumbar puncture ( LP) is a medical procedure required during spinal anesthesia and for obtaining cerebrospinal fluid samples in the diagnosis of neurological disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of physicians ' handedness bias and the laterality of patients ' recumbent position on the success rate of LPs. A prospective multicenter study including 36 physicians ( 18 left-handed and 18 right-handed) and 7200 patients was conducted in 6 medical centers. In each center , 1200 patients were randomized into group L ( LPs performed by left-handed physicians) or group R ( LPs performed by right-handed physicians). Each physician performed 200 cases of LPs , of which the laterality of the recumbent position ( either on the left or right side) was decided after a second randomization. A successful LP was considered when the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid was observed upon the first attempt. There was no significant difference in patient characteristics between groups L and R. Right-handed physicians had a significantly higher LP success rate with patients in the left lateral recumbent position ( LRP) ( 1595/1800 vs. 1408/1800; odds ratio , 0.539; 95 % confidence interval , 0.348-0.836; P = 0.006). For left-handed physicians , the LP success rate was higher when patients were in the right LRP ( 1424/1800 vs. 1593/1800 , odds ratio , 0.449; 95 % confidence interval , 0.283-0.711; P = 0.001). Patients ' age , sex , height , and weight were not statistically related to LP success during multivariate analyses. Physicians handedness bias and patient laterality of recumbent position affects the success of LPs. Right-handed physicians have a greater chance of performing successful LPs when patients are in the left LRP , and vice versa.
