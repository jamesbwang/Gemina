  Biomedical research has become a digital data-intensive endeavor , relying on secure and scalable computing , storage , and network infrastructure , which has traditionally been purchased , supported , and maintained locally. For certain types of biomedical applications , cloud computing has emerged as an alternative to locally maintained traditional computing approaches. Cloud computing offers users pay-as-you-go access to services such as hardware infrastructure , platforms , and software for solving common biomedical computational problems. Cloud computing services offer secure on-demand storage and analysis and are differentiated from traditional high-performance computing by their rapid availability and scalability of services. As such , cloud services are engineered to address big data problems and enhance the likelihood of data and analytics sharing , reproducibility , and reuse. Here , we provide an introductory perspective on cloud computing to help the reader determine its value to their own research.
