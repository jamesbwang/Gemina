  Data on the genetic predisposition to mastocytosis are scarce. The aim of this work was to study the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms of Toll-like receptor ( TLR) -2 , TLR-4 , and TLR-9 genes in Polish patients with mastocytosis. The study comprised 137 patients with mastocytosis ( 102 cutaneous ( 60 children and 42 adults) and 35 systemic cases); 171 disease-free individuals were used as controls. The frequency of polymorphisms R753Q ( rs5743708) of TLR-2 , 896 A > G ( rs496790) of TLR-4 , and -1237 C > T ( rs5743836) of TLR-9 genes were determined with the use of the amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction method. It was found that the R753Q TLR-2 gene polymorphism was significantly more frequent in patients with mastocytosis in comparison to healthy controls ( p = 0.037) and in the group of SM versus controls ( p = 0.0076). The presence in the genotype 753Q variant of TLR-2 gene increased the risk of mastocytosis more than 2-fold ( OR 2.51; p = 0.04) , and the risk of SM more than 4-fold ( OR 4.22; p = 0.01). TLR-4 and TLR-9 polymorphisms were not associated with mastocytosis. Our results suggest that the R753Q polymorphism of the TLR-2 gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of mastocytosis.
