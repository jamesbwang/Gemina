  Parental Substance Use Disorder ( SUD) constitutes a high-risk condition for parent-child interactions and child development. Empirical evidence indicates high rates of psychopathology and neuropsychological impairments in individuals with SUD. Despite research indicating that parenting skills are related to psychological well-being and cognitive/neuropsychological functioning , prior studies have not examined the associations between these areas of parental functioning and the quality of parent-child interactions in the context of SUD.
