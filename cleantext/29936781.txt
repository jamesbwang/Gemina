  Objective: We aimed to compare the cytomorphological diagnosis in serous effusion<symptom> and quality of background between modified liquid-based cytology ( modified-LBC) and CytoRich Red ( CRR) preservative. Methods: We used an experimental study design: 110 fresh serous effusions<symptom> were received from 50 cases negative for malignant effusions<symptom> and 60 cases positive for malignant effusions<symptom>. All fresh serous effusions<symptom> were processed using both the CRR solution and the modified-LBC preparation. Blind sample slides were interpreted for cytomorphological diagnosis and the quality of background by 2 cytotechnologists. Result: All cases had the same diagnosis irrespective of the method. There was no statistically significant difference in the cytological diagnosis between the CRR and modified-LBC preparations ( p > 0.999). The quality of the background smear for the CRR preparation was clean ( 54 %) , moderate in 42 % , and poor in 4 %. By comparison , the modified-LBC preparation was clean in 46 % , moderate in 47 % , and poor in 7 %. The difference between the quality of background smears between the two methods was not statistically significant ( p = 0.527). Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference in the diagnosis or quality of background between CRR and modified-LBC preparations. The serous effusion<symptom> specimen prepared by modified-LBC solution was less expensive than CRR. The modified-LBC could be an alternative preparation when commercial preparations are too expensive.
