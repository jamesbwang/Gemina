  Exposure to stress , particularly in periods of rapid brain maturation such as adolescence , can profoundly influence developmental processes that undergird the organization of structural and functional brain networks and that may mediate the association between stressful experiences and maladaptive outcomes. While studies in translational developmental neuroscience often focus on how specific brain regions or targeted connections are altered by stress and psychiatric disease , the emerging field of network science may be especially valuable for elucidating the impact of stress on the intricate connectomics of the adolescent brain. Here we review recent studies that use graph theory and other network science approaches to understand normative adolescent brain development , effects of childhood maltreatment on the brain , and disorders characterized by pathological responses to stress in adolescents. Overall , these studies demonstrate that graph theory can be useful in identifying and quantifying developmental processes related to segregation , integration , and localized hub influence that are affected by stress exposure and that may lead to psychopathology. Finally , we discuss limitations in the current application of graph theory in this area and suggest what we believe are important directions for future work.
