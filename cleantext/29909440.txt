  The metabolism of arachidonic acid and other polyunsaturated fatty acids produces eicosanoids , a family of biologically active lipids that are implicated in homeostasis and in several pathologies that involve inflammation<symptom>. Inflammatory processes mediated by eicosanoids promote carcinogenesis by exerting direct effects on cancer cells and by affecting the tumor microenvironment. Therefore , understanding how eicosanoids mediate cancer progression may lead to better approaches and chemopreventive strategies for the treatment of cancer. The matricellular protein thrombospondin-1 is involved in processes that profoundly regulate inflammatory pathways that contribute to carcinogenesis and metastatic spread. This review focuses on interactions of thrombospondin-1 and eicosanoids in the microenvironment that promote carcinogenesis and how the microenvironment can be targeted for cancer prevention to increase curative responses of cancer patients.
