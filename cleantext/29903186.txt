  To evaluate the single and combined effects of chlorpyrifos ( CPF) and carbofuran ( CF) pesticides on cell lines cultured in vitro , and clarify the pattern of joint action. Rat pheochromocytoma ( PC12 cells) were treated with different concentrations of CPF ( 0 , 50 , 100 , 200 and 400 μmol/L) and CF ( 0 , 25 , 50 , 100 and 200 μmol/L) for 12 h separately , the combined effects of two kinds of pesticides should be studied respectively in the low dose ( CPF 50 μmol/L , CF 25 μmol/L) and high dose ( CPF 200 μmol/L , CF 100 μmol/L) levels. After exposure , detectingacetylcholinesterase ( ACh E) activity and using fluorescent probe 2 ' , 7 '- dichlorfluorescin diacetate ( DCFH-DA) , thiobarbituric acid ( TBA) method , xanthine oxidation , 5 , 5 '- dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid ( DTNB) coloration to detect the intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production , lipid peroxidation production malondialdehyde ( MDA) , activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase ( SOD) and glutathione peroxidase ( GPx) , respectively. Compared with the control group , CPF and CF could decrease the ACh E activity , induce ROS overproduction in a dose-effect way and increase the activity of SOD , GPx ( P < 0. 01) , but MDA content showed no significant change. Factorial ANOVA revealed that the combined effect of CPF and CF , there was no interaction at lower dose level , but interaction existed at higher dose level ( P < 0. 01). The main mode of action was synergistic effect. Chlorpyrifos , carbofuran single or combined , has cytotoxicity effect. The main combined effect between chlorpyrifos and carbofuran is synergistic effect , oxidative stress damage may be one of the mechanisms.
