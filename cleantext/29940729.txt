  Conjugated polymers incorporated with cycloplatinated complexes ( P1-Pt and P2-Pt) were used as dispersants for single-walled carbon nanotubes ( SWCNTs). Significant changes in the UV-vis absorption spectra were observed after the formation of the polymer/SWCNT hybrids. Molecular dynamics ( MD) simulations revealed the presence of a strong interaction between the cycloplatinated complex moieties and the SWCNT surface. The photoinduced electron transfer processes in these hybrids were strongly dependent on the type of the comonomer unit. Upon photoexcitation , the excited P1-Pt donates electrons to the SWCNT , while P2-Pt accepts electrons from the photoexcited SWCNT. These observations were supported by results from Raman and femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy experiments. The strong electronic interaction between the Pt complexes and the SWCNT gives rise to a new hybrid system that has a controllable photoinduced electron transfer flow , which are important in regulating the charge transport processes in SWCNT-based optoelectronic devices.
