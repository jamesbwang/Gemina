  Autophagy dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD). Natural compounds present in bergamot polyphenol fraction ( BPF) prevent NAFLD and induce autophagy in rat livers. Here , we employed HepG2 cells expressing DsRed-LC3-GFP , a highly sensitive model system to screen for proautophagic compounds present in BPF. BPF induced autophagy in a time- and dose-dependent fashion and the effect was amplified in cells loaded with palmitic acid. Autophagy was mediated by the hydrophobic fraction of acid-hydrolyzed BPF ( A-BPF) , containing six flavanone and flavone aglycones as identified by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. Among them , naringenin , hesperitin , eriodictyol and diosmetin were weak inducers of autophagy. Apigenin showed the strongest and dose-dependent proautophagic activity at early time points ( 6 h). Luteolin induced a biphasic autophagic response , strong at low doses and inhibitory at higher doses. Both flavones were toxic in HepG2 cells and in differentiated human liver progenitors HepaRG upon longer treatments ( 24 h). In contrast , BPF and A-BPF did not show any toxicity , but induced a persistent increase in autophagic flux. A mixture of six synthetic aglycones mimicking A-BPF was sufficient to induce a similar autophagic response , but it was mildly cytotoxic. Thus , while six main BPF flavonoids fully account for its proautophagic activity , their combined effect is not sufficient to abrogate cytotoxicity of individual compounds. This suggests that a natural polyphenol phytocomplex , such as BPF , is a safer and more effective strategy for the treatment of NAFLD than the use of pure flavonoids.
