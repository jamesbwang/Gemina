  Erectile dysfunction ( ED) is a common condition. Pharmacological management of ED involves medications produced by chemical synthesis. Despite high efficiency , their use is often accompanied by some side effects. Considering this , herbal preparations with sufficient efficacy and greater safety have received much attention. To compare the efficacy and safety of two herbal preparations ( EFFEX Tribulus and Tribestan) based on Tribulus Terrestris<pathogen> herb dry extract in patients with ED. A total of 173 patients were enrolled in the study , of whom 87 ( group I) and 86 ( group II) received EFFEX Tribulus and Tribestan , respectively. The mean age of patients was 42.2 +/ -11.5 years in group I and 42.8 +/ -11.2 years in group II. One hundred fifty two patients completed the study. The follow-up was 13 weeks ( the herbal preparation dose was titrated at week five after the treatment initiation). The effectiveness of treatment was assessed on five follow-up visits using the IIEF , AMS , MSF , GAQ questionnaires , and a complex of diagnostic and laboratory studies. At visit five compared to visit 1 , the mean IIEF erectile function domain score increased by 5.7 +/ -4.6 and 5.2 +/ -4.3 points in group I and II , respectively. In both groups , all other IIEF domain scores demonstrated a statistically significant increase. The AMS scores decreased from 32.93 +/ -10.04 to 25.02 +/ -7.62 points in group I and 31.78 +/ -10.37 to 24.55 +/ -7.31 points in group II. The SMF scores increased from 22.36 +/ -4.85 to 27.16 +/ -4.80 points in group I and from 22.13 +/ -3.69 to 26.10 +/ -5.69 points in group II. Besides , the use of the herbal preparations was associated with a decrease in the serum cholesterol level , more pronounced with increasing patient age ( correlation coefficient -0.06 , p = 0.41). The herbal preparations EFFEX Tribulus and Tribestan have a similar efficacy and safety profiles.
