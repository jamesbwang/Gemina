  Accidental discovery of misattributed parentage is an age-old problem in clinical medicine , but the ability to detect it routinely has increased recently as a result of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies coupled with family sequencing studies. Problems arise at the clinical-research boundary , where policies and consent forms guaranteeing nondisclosure may conflict with standard clinical care. To examine the challenges of managing misattributed parentage within hybrid translational research studies , we used a case study of a developmentally delayed child with a candidate variant found through a large-scale trio genome sequencing study in which data from unrelated samples were routinely excluded. We discuss whether genetic parentage should be explicitly confirmed during clinical validation , thus giving greater weight<symptom> to the diagnosis according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics variant interpretation guidelines , and what tensions this approach would create. We recommend that the possibility of finding and disclosing misattributed parentage should be addressed during the consent or pretest counseling process , and that clinical relevance should determine whether or not to disclose results in the clinic. This proposition has implications for research governance , and implies that it may not always be possible to uphold nondisclosure commitments as investigations move from research to clinical care.
