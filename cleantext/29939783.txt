High Alt Med Biol. 19:124-130 , 2018.-Over 140 million people reside at altitudes exceeding 2500 m across the world , resulting in exposure to atmospheric ( hypobaric) hypoxia. Whether this chronic exposure is beneficial or detrimental to the cardiovascular system , however , is uncertain. On one hand , multiple studies have suggested a protective effect of living at moderate and high altitudes for cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease ( CVD) events. Conversely , residence at high altitude comes at the tradeoff of developing diseases such as chronic mountain<disease> sickness and high-altitude pulmonary hypertension and worsens outcomes for diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Interestingly , recently published data show a potential role for severe hypoxia as a unique and unexpected therapy after myocardial infarction. In this review , we will discuss the current literature evaluating the effects of altitude exposure and the accompanying hypoxia on health and the potential therapeutic applications of hypoxia on CVD.
