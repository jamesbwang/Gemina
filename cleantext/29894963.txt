  During growth and senescence , fungal fruiting bodies accumulate essential and non-essential elements to different extent in their compartments. This study bases on a dataset of 32 basidiocarps of the ectomycorrhizal Lactarius pubescens sampled in a former U mining area. Statistical analyses were combined with rare earth element ( REE , La-Lu) patterns to study the element distribution within sporocarp compartments and between three different age classes. For this purpose , fruiting bodies were separated into stipe , pileus trama , pileipelles and lamellae , dried and digested with HNO
