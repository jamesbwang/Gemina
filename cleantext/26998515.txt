  Obesity is a known risk factor for breast cancer. Since obesity rates are constantly rising worldwide , understanding the molecular details of the interaction between adipose tissue and breast tumors becomes an urgent task. To investigate potential molecular changes in breast cancer cells induced by co-existing adipocytes , we used a co-culture system of different breast cancer cell lines ( MCF-7 and T47D: ER
