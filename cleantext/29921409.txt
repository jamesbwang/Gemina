  This study aims to compare the clinical characteristics of a new flowable resin-based composite with those of a traditional composite when applied to deciduous molars for class II restorations. Twentyeight children between 6-12 years of age , with paired minimal Class II cavities present on their primary molars , were chosen. The paired cavities were restored with either a microhybrid composite or a new flowable resin-based composite. The composites were assigned to cavities in either the right or left side of the mouth<symptom> , using random allocation tables. Each pair of restorations were clinically assessed at sixmonth intervals following the United States Public Health Service criteria. The prevalence of carious lesions<symptom> was higher in maxillar molars ( 53.6 %) compared to the mandibular molars ( 46.4 %). At 24 months , Charlie or Delta scores in the paired groups were not seen in any patient , thus demonstrating a clinical success. The statistical analysis using Pearson 's chi-squared test did not reveal significant p-values for any parameter except the proximal contact showing significant p-values for this parameter. SDR appears to be the material of choice for the restoration of deciduous teeth due to its clinical features shown at 24 months as well as its ease and speed of application.
