  A total of 58 varieties in Lonicera japonica<pathogen> from 20 producing areas were amplified by 22 pairs of SSR primers. Seven pairs of polymorphic primers were screened and their primers were used to establish DNA identity card and analyze genetic similarity.All the 58 varieties could be distinguished each other by the DNA identity card constituted by 7 pairs of core SSR primers.The genetic similarity coefficients of 58 varieties ranged from 0.366 7 to 0.916 7 by using PopGene32 （ vesion1 .32 ）. Furthermore , all the varieties consistency were classified into 4 groups and constructed an evaluation table according to cluster analysis by an un-weighted pair-group average method with arithmetic mean. As expected , the results of cluster and evaluation table reflected 58 varieties relatives , which provide reference information for the selection of fine germplasm of L. japonica<pathogen> and the theoretical basis for the study of Dao-di herbs.
