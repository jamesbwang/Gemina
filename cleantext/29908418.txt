  Patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia<disease> ( sAML) have poor outcomes , with CR/CRi rates of 25-35 % with standard 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy , while single center non-comparative analyses suggest promising outcomes with FLAG. We conducted a single-center , retrospective cohort study assessing outcomes in treatment-na√Øve patients with sAML treated with fludarabine , high-dose cytarabine , and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( FLAG , n = 40) compared with 7 + 3 ( n = 66). Median patient age was 63 years ( range: 27-82) in the FLAG group and 60 years ( range: 21-76) in the 7 + 3 group ( P = 0.968). Patients treated with FLAG achieved higher overall response rates ( CR + CRi + MLFS) compared to 7 + 3 ( 70 % vs. 48 % , P = 0.043). FLAG was well tolerated , with only one induction death ( 30-day mortality rate , 3 % vs. 8 % , P = 0.405) and no cases of cerebellar toxicity. Duration of neutropenia was significantly shorter with FLAG ( median 16 vs. 23 days , P < 0.001). Half of the FLAG-treated patients proceeded to consolidative therapy compared with only 27 % of those who received 7 + 3 ( P = 0.022). Overall survival was comparable between groups ( 8.5 mos , FLAG vs. 9.1 mos , 7 + 3; P = 0.798). Thus , FLAG may represent a low-cost treatment strategy in sAML that produces higher response rates and promising survival outcomes with minimal treatment-related toxicity. Further studies are required to prospectively compare FLAG to the newly FDA-approved CPX-351 in sAML.
