  We describe the case of a transplanted patient with high-risk HPV infection that manifested as multiple genital condylomas and abnormal Papanicolaou ( Pap) smear. Her immunosuppressants were corticosteroids , cyclosporine , and azathioprine. Since gynecologic treatments to eradicate condylomas were completely unsuccessful , cyclosporine was replaced by everolimus. Soon after , condylomas disappeared , HPV status became negative , and Pap smear returned to normal and has remained normal since.
