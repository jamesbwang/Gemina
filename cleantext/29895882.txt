  Cross-sectional psychometric study. The University of Washington Self-Efficacy Scale ( UW-SES) is a measure of self-efficacy regarding managing challenges related to multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury ( SCI) that can be used across disabling conditions. The objective of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of its short form , the UW-SES-6 , using the Rasch model. Community , The Netherlands. Secondary analysis of data from the ALLRISC study. Participants were 261 individuals with a time since onset of SCI ( TSI) for at least 10 years , 18-35 at the onset of SCI , and used a wheelchair in everyday life. Rasch analyses were conducted to examine stochastic ordering ( fit) , unidimensionality , local dependency , reliability , response scale structure , targeting , and item bias. Median age was 47.8 years ( Inter-Quartile Range ( IQR) 41.9-55) , median TSI was 22 years ( IQR 16.8-30.3) , 73.6 % were male , 90.4 % had a traumatic SCI , 39.8 % had tetraplegia , and 81.6 % had motor complete SCI. After merging the middle three response categories of item 4 , the UW-SES-6 showed satisfactory item fit without local dependence. The PSI was high ( 0.87). Comparison of the person and item threshold distributions showed satisfactory targeting of the UW-SES-6 to the study group. No differential item functioning was seen with respect to sex , age , level of education , level and completeness of lesion<symptom> , and TSI. This study showed the UW-SES-6 to be a scale with sound psychometric properties that can be used as a quick and easy self-report measure of self-efficacy in people with SCI.
