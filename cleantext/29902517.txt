  The nose-to-brain delivery of ghrelin loaded in liposomes is a promising approach for the management of cachexia. It could limit the plasmatic degradation of ghrelin and provide direct access to the brain , where ghrelin 's specific receptors are located. Anionic liposomes coated with chitosan in either a liquid or a dry-powder formulation were compared. The powder formulation showed stronger adhesion to mucins ( 89 ± 4 % vs 61 ± 4 %) , higher ghrelin entrapment efficiency ( 64 ± 2 % vs 55 ± 4 %) , higher enzymatic protection against trypsin ( 26 ± 2 % vs 20 ± 3 %) and lower ghrelin storage degradation at 25 °C ( 2.67 ± 1.1 % vs 95.64 ± 0.85 % after 4 weeks). The powder formulation was also placed in unit-dose system devices that were able to generate an appropriate aerosol characterized by a Dv50 of 38 ± 6 µm , a limited percentage of particles smaller than 10 µm of 4 ± 1 % and a reproducible mass delivery ( CV: 1.49 %). In addition , the device was able to deposit a large amount of powder ( 52.04 % w/w) in the olfactory zone of a 3D-printed nasal cast. The evaluated combination of the powder formulation and the device could provide a promising treatment for cachexia.
