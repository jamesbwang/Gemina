  Parkinson 's disease patients report disturbed sleep patterns long before motor<symptom> dysfunction<symptom>. Here , in parkin and pink1 models , we identify circadian rhythm and sleep pattern defects and map these to specific neuropeptidergic neurons in fly models and in hypothalamic neurons differentiated from patient induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs). Parkin and Pink1 control the clearance of mitochondria by protein ubiquitination. Although we do not observe major defects in mitochondria of mutant neuropeptidergic neurons , we do find an excess of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial contacts. These excessive contact sites cause abnormal lipid trafficking that depletes phosphatidylserine from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) and disrupts the production of neuropeptide-containing vesicles. Feeding mutant animals phosphatidylserine rescues neuropeptidergic vesicle production and acutely restores normal sleep patterns in mutant animals. Hence , sleep patterns and circadian disturbances in Parkinson 's disease models are explained by excessive ER-mitochondrial contacts , and blocking their formation or increasing phosphatidylserine levels rescues the defects in vivo.
