  Purpose/Aim of the study: To evaluate if there is any relationship or coincidence between gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD) and primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction ( PANDO). We enrolled 180 patients with PANDO , confirmed by positive regurgitation on sac squeezing or by irrigation test. In the control group , any patient with lacrimal drainage obstruction was excluded. For diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux we used a ( Gerd Q) questionnaire by R. Jones. According to Gerd Q , prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux in patients with PANDO was 20 % ( 36 out of 180 patients) and in the control group , it was 10.6 % ( 19 out of 180 patients) , which was significantly higher in the presence of PANDO ( p valve = 0.013). In women , 28 patients ( 23.5 %) in the case group versus 13 patients ( 10.9 %) in the control group has gastroesophageal reflux ( p value = 0.01) , which was not significant among men ( p value = 0.870). When we considered age as an independent variable , results reveled significant value only for patients over 60 years old ( p value = 0.008). The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease was significantly higher in patients with PANDO. This statistical relationship was greater among women and patients over 60 years old. In this study , we found an association between GERD and PANDO.
