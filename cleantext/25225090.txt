  In recent years , the role of astrocytes in shaping neuronal signaling has come to the forefront of neuroscience research. The development of genetic tools that enable targeted manipulation of astrocytes has revealed a wealth of mechanisms by which they can alter the synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability of neurons in behaviorally relevant ways. In parallel , several studies have demonstrated significant variability in the gene expression and physiology of astrocytes within and between brain regions. Thus , to form an accurate understanding of how astrocytes contribute to neuronal transmission , we must take into consideration the diversity that exists in their intrinsic properties. In this review , we will summarize recent findings on astrocyte heterogeneity and discuss the implications for their interactions with neurons and their effects on neuronal transmission.
