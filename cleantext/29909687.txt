  The current study explored whether intra-articular ( IA) injection of autologous adipose mesenchymal stem cells ( ASCs) combined with hyaluronic acid ( HA) achieved better therapeutic efficacy than autologous stromal vascular fraction ( SVF) combined with HA to prevent osteoarthritis ( OA) progression and determined how long autologous ASCs combined with HA must remain in the joint<symptom> to observe efficacy. OA models were established by performing anterior cruciate ligament transection ( ACLT) and medial meniscectomy ( MM). Autologous SVF ( 1 Ã— 10
