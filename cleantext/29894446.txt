  To determine the percentage of time that critically ill children have a parent at the bedside and to identify extrinsic factors that are associated with percent of time with parental presence at the bedside. Prospective cohort study. PICU in a single tertiary care children 's hospital. Primary two parents of all children admitted to the PICU on 12 preselected days during a 1-year period from 2014 to 2015. None. A total of 111 observations of 108 unique PICU admissions and families were performed. Children had at least one parent present a mean of 58.2 % ( SD , 34.6 %) of the time. Mothers spent more time at the bedside ( 56.3 % ( SD , 31.0 %)) than fathers ( 37.3 % ( SD , 29.5 %)) ( p = 0.0001). Percent of time with parental presence at the bedside was positively correlated with age ( rs = 0.23; p = 0.02) and negatively associated with Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score ( rs = -0.26; p = 0.01). Percent of time with parental presence at the bedside was lower for children who were mechanically ventilated ( 42.8 % ( SD , 35.5 %)) than not ( 64.5 % ( SD , 32.2 %)) ( p = 0.01) and whose parent ( s) were single ( 45.5 % ( SD , 27.5 %)) or cohabitating/common-law ( 35.7 % ( SD , 26.4 %)) compared with parents who were married ( 64.2 % ( SD , 34.2 %)) or separated/divorced ( 68.3 % ( SD , 28.8 %)) ( p = 0.02). Percent of time with parental presence at the bedside was higher for children with chronic illnesses ( 63.4 % ( SD , 32.9 %) vs 50.1 % ( SD , 35.8 %) without; p = 0.04) , when there was a bed in the patient room ( 61.4 % ( SD , 34.0 %) vs 32.5 % ( SD , 28.3 %) without; p = 0.01) , and when parents slept in the patient room ( 90.3 % ( SD , 11.2 %)) compared with their own home ( 37.6 % ( SD , 34.4 %)) ( p < 0.0001). Percent of time with parental presence at the bedside was not correlated with day of PICU stay , number of siblings , previous PICU admission , isolation status , or nursing ratio. Children had a parent present at the bedside approximately 60 % of the time. The parents of younger , sicker children may benefit from supportive interventions during PICU admission. Further research is needed to examine both extrinsic and intrinsic factors affecting parental presence at the bedside.
