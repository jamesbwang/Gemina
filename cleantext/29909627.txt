  Nanoparticle characteristics , including their size , are governed by the reagents employed and the reaction parameters. Here , we systemically vary the catalyst , oxygen content , temperature , and solvent to modify the size and zeta-potential of thiolated organosilica nanoparticles. The particles were synthesized by self-condensation of 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane in a range of organic solvents in contact with oxygen , with NaOH and other catalysts. The particle size increased with increasing reaction temperature ( 70 ± 1 nm at 50 °C; 50 ± 1 nm at room temperature) but decreased when air was bubbled through the reaction mixture compared to no bubbling. A significant decrease in the particle size was seen when increasing the dielectric constant of the solvent and when increasing the catalyst concentration; from these , we provide empirical equations that can be used to design particle sizes by manipulating the dielectric constant of the solvent ( or cosolvents) or by varying the NaOH catalyst concentration when dimethylsulfoxide is the selected solvent.
