  People with chronic opioid use disorder often present to treatment with individual and structural vulnerabilities and remain at risk of reporting adverse health outcomes. This risk is greatly compounded by tobacco smoking , which is highly prevalent among people with chronic opioid use disorder. Despite the known burden of tobacco smoking on health , the relationship between nicotine dependence and health has not been studied among those receiving injectable opioid agonist treatment. As such , the present study aims to explore the association between nicotine dependence and physical health among participants of the Study to Assess Longer-Term Opioid Medication Effectiveness ( SALOME) at baseline and six-months. SALOME was a double-blind phase III clinical trial testing the non-inferiority of injectable hydromorphone to injectable diacetylmorphine for chronic opioid use disorder. Participants reporting tobacco smoking were included in a linear regression analysis of physical health at baseline ( before receiving treatment) and at six-months. At baseline , nicotine dependence score , lifetime history of emotional , physical , or sexual abuse and prior month safe injection site access were independently and significantly associated with physical health. At six-months nicotine dependence score was the only variable that maintained this significant and independent association with physical health. Findings indicate that after six-months , the injectable treatment effectively brought equity to patients ' physical health status , yet the association with nicotine dependence remained. Findings could inform whether the provision of treatment for nicotine dependence should be made a priority in settings where injectable opioid agonist treatment is delivered to achieve improvements in overall physical health in this population.
