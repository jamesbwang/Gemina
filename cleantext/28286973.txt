  Curcumin is a polyphenol extracted from the rhizomes of Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the expressions of miR-145 in LSCC tissues and cells. The effects of miR-145 and curcumin on cell proliferation , apoptosis , cell cycle , migration and invasion were explored by MTT assay , flow cytometry analysis , Transwell migration and invasion assay , respectively. The effects of miR-145 combined with curcumin on the phosphoinositol 1,3 kinase ( PI3K)/ protein kinase B ( Akt)/ mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR) pathway were detected by Western blot analysis. miR-145 was significantly downregulated in LSCC tissues and cells. Curcumin administration upregulated miR-145 expression in LSCC cells in a dose-dependent manner. miR-145 overexpression and curcumin treatment both markedly suppressed cell proliferation , migration and invasion and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in LSCC cells. Moreover , curcumin treatment reversed the enhanced effects on cell viability , migration and invasion and the inhibitory effects on apoptosis conferred by anti-miR-145 in LSCC cells. Curcumin treatment dramatically aggravated miR-145-induced inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and reversed anti-miR-145-mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in LSCC cells. Curcumin suppressed LSCC progression through the upregulation of miR-145 and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
