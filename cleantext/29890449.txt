  Grassroot Soccer developed SKILLZ Street-a soccer-based life skills program with a supplementary SMS platform-to support adolescent girls at risk for HIV<pathogen> , violence , and sexual and reproductive health challenges. We conducted a mixed-methods assessment of preliminary outcomes and implementation processes in three primary schools in Soweto , South Africa , from August to December 2013. Quantitative methods included participant attendance and SMS platform usage tracking , pre/post questionnaires , and structured observation. Qualitative data were collected from program participants , parents , teachers , and a social worker during 6 focus group discussions and 4 in-depth interviews. Of 394 participants enrolled , 97 % ( n = 382) graduated , and 217 unique users accessed the SMS platform. Questionnaires completed by 213 participants ( mean age: 11.9 , SD: 3.02 years) alongside qualitative findings showed modest improvements in participants ' perceptions of power in relationships and gender equity , self-esteem , self-efficacy to avoid unwanted sex , communication with others about HIV<pathogen> and sex , and HIV-related knowledge and stigma. The coach-participant relationship , safe space , and integration of soccer were raised as key intervention components. Implementation challenges were faced around delivery of soccer-based activities. Findings highlight the relevance and importance of programs like SKILLZ Street in addressing challenges facing adolescent girls in South African townships. Recommendations for future programs are provided.
