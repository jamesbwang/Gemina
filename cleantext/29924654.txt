  ( 1) To define a quantitative cutoff value for incidental pituitary Technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile ( Tc-99m MIBI) uptake above which is of clinical importance and ( 2) to investigate possible factors affecting the intensity of uptake in pituitary adenoma. A retrospective analysis of 55 patients with a simultaneous parathyroid single-photon emission computed tomography and pituitary magnetic resonance imaging were included. Twenty-four patients with pituitary adenoma were chosen as the study group and 31/55 patients who had no signs of a pituitary adenoma were included in the control group. Mean count values ( count/pixel) for pituitary region of interest ( ROI)/ mean value for normal cortical region ROI ( P/C) were calculated in both groups. Median P/C values were compared. A cutoff value for P/C was calculated as a quantitative parameter to indicate pituitary tumors. Possible contributing factors in intensity of pituitary Tc-99m MIBI uptake were investigated. Median P/C ratios were significantly higher in the study group ( p < 0.001). A cutoff value of 7.675 was found for P/C to have a sensitivity , spesificity , positive predictive value , and negative predictive value 100 % , 96.8 % , 96 % , and 100 % , respectively. There was no correlation between investigated factors and degree of pituitary Tc-99m MIBI uptake. Incidental pituitary Tc-99m MIBI uptake values above 7.675 for P/C are suspicious for pituitary adenoma and can be further investigated clinically and radiologically. Tc-99m MIBI uptake is not affected from the biochemical nature of the adenoma , the therapies received , size , local invasion , or cystic necrotic component of the tumor.
