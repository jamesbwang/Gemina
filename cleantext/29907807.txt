  A human leukocyte antigen ( HLA)- matched unrelated donor is the primary alternative donor for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in Japan. In considering an optimal donor registry size , the availability of HLA-matched donors is important. In this study , the probability of finding an HLA-A ,- B ,- C , and- DRB1 allele-matched donor was estimated using two different methods based on the haplotype frequencies in the Japanese population: an actual measurement method ( AMM) and a formula method ( FM). According to AMM , the probabilities of finding an HLA-matched donor were 40.5 % in 100,000 donors , 54.4 % in 300,000 , 60.0 % in 500,000 , and 63.4 % in 700,000. On the other hand , according to FM , the probabilities were 47.8 % in 100,000 donors , 59.9 % in 300,000 , 65.3 % in 500,000 , and 68.8 % in 700,000. The probabilities increased by 8.6 or 7.7 % , 3.2 or 3.1 % , 2.1 or 1.9 % , and 1.6 or 1.3 % in AMM or FM , respectively , as the registry size increased by 100,000. The rate of increase in the probability of finding an HLA-matched donor will become smaller as the registry size increases due to the diversity of haplotypes. Therefore , it is important to set a target donor registry size for efficient donor recruitment by considering the haplotype frequencies in the population.
