  The failure to exploit collective wisdom is evident in the conspicuous difficulty to solve hidden-profile tasks. While previous accounts focus on group-dynamics and motivational biases , the present research applies a metacognitive perspective to an ordinary learning approach. Assuming that evaluative learning is sensitive to the frequency with which targets are paired with positive versus negative attributes , selective repetition of targets ' assets and deficits will inevitably bias the resulting evaluations. As selective repetition effects are ubiquitous , metacognitive monitoring and control functions are required to correct for repetition biases. However , three experiments show that metacognitive myopia prevents judges from correction , even when explicitly warned to ignore selective repetition ( Experiment 1) , when same-speaker repetitions rule out social validation ( Experiment 2) and when blatant debriefing enforces superficial corrections ( Experiment 3). For a comprehensive understanding of collective judgments and decisions , it is essential to take metacognitive monitoring and control into account.
