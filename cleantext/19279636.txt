  Intermontane basins in the southern piedmont of the Qinling Mountains are important sources of information on hominin occupation and settlement , and provide an excellent opportunity to study early human evolution and behavioral adaptation. Here , we present the results of a detailed magnetostratigraphic investigation of the sedimentary sequence of hominin-bearing Bailong Cave in Yunxi Basin , central China. Correlation to the geomagnetic polarity time scale was achieved using previously published biostratigraphy ,
