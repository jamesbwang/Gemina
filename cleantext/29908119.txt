  Acid sphingomyelinase ( ASM) is the rate-limiting enzyme cleaving sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphorylcholin. CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T ( Treg) cells depend on CD28 signaling for their survival and function , a receptor that activates the ASM. Both , basal and CD28-induced ASM activities are higher in Treg cells than in conventional CD4 + T ( Tconv) cells. In ASM-deficient ( Smpd1-/-) as compared to wt mice , membranes<symptom> of T cells contain 7-10-fold more sphingomyelin and two- to three-fold more ceramide , and are in a state of higher order than membranes<symptom> of T cells from wt mice , which may facilitate their activation. Indeed , the frequency of Treg cells among CD4 + T cells in ASM-deficient mice and their suppressive activity in vitro are increased. Moreover , in vitro stimulation of ASM-deficient T cells in the presence of TGF-Î² and IL-2 leads to higher numbers of induced Treg cells. Pharmacological inhibition of the ASM with a clinically used tricyclic antidepressant such as amitriptyline in mice or in tissue culture of murine or human T cells induces higher frequencies of Treg cells among CD4 + T cells within a few days. This fast alteration of the balance<symptom> between T cell populations in vitro is due to the elevated cell death of Tconv cells and protection of the CD25high Treg cells by IL-2. Together , these findings suggest that ASM-inhibiting antidepressants , including a fraction of the serotonin re-uptake inhibitors ( SSRIs) , are moderately immunosuppressive and should be considered for the therapy of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.
