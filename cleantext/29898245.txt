  To report the use of therapeutic plasma exchange ( TPE) in a dog with carprofen toxicosis. A 6-year-old female neutered Bichon Frise weighing 6.9 kg was examined after it had ingested 72 mg/kg carprofen. Mild<symptom> dehydration<symptom> without azotemia and with a urine specific gravity of 1.050 was noted at presentation. Treatment consisted of induction of emesis , symptomatic medical therapy , and TPE. The TPE achieved 1.5 plasma volume exchanges over 3 hours. Blood samples and effluent samples were collected every 30 minutes during TPE and additional blood samples were collected 11 and 35 hours after treatment. Carprofen concentrations in these samples were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. A 51 % reduction in serum carprofen concentration was achieved following TPE. This report describes the successful reduction of plasma carprofen concentration in a dog using TPE. Although recent studies suggest that this particular dog may not have received a toxic dose , a 51 % reduction of plasma carprofen concentration was achieved over 180 minutes , and TPE may be beneficial for treatment of dogs that have ingested higher doses.
