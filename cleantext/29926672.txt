  To identify the genotype of ( APP/PS1) transgenic mice and evaluate the changing of cognitive and behavioral fu nctions , provide an effective animal model for the Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) research. Male APP/PS1 transgenic mice mated with female APP/PS1 transgenic mice , and the genotype of their filial mice was identified by PCR. The APP +/ PS1 + mice were assigned into AD model group ( AD group , ① A APP/PS1 genome DNA about 360 bp size was detected. The methods of feeding and breeding were successful to attain APP/PS1 transgenic mice. ② Statistical significance was found in the differences of the capacity of learning and memory between 7-month-old APP/PS1 positive mice and negative mice ( APP/PS1 transgenic mice present typical symptoms and behaviors of Alzheimer 's disease. The transgenic mouse is an effective tool for the research and prevention of AD.
