  Circular RNA ( circRNA) belongs to the non-coding RNA family and is involved in various human cancers , such as lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Nevertheless , whether circRNA expression is related to chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL) progression remains largely unclear. In our study , we investigated the role of circ-CBFB in CLL. We found that circ-CBFB was markedly overexpressed in CLL cells compared to normal controls. Furthermore , we found that circ-CBFB could serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for CLL patients. We also explored the physiological function of circ-CBFB. We found that circ-CBFB knockdown significantly suppressed CLL cell proliferation , arrested cell cycle progression , and induced cellular apoptosis. In terms of its mechanism , we identified circ-CBFB as a sponge of miR-607 , which targeted FZD3. By inhibiting miR-607 availability , circ-CBFB promoted FZD3 expression , leading to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and consequent CLL progression. Taken together , our findings revealed that the circ-CBFB/miR -607/ FZD3/Wnt/β-catenin regulatory signaling cascade contributes to CLL progression.
