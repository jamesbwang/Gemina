  The anchoveta ( Engraulis ringens) and sardine ( Strangomera bentincki) are coastal pelagic species with important spawning areas off the coast of Chile. The discharge of secondary-treated effluents from a kraft pulp plant near one of these spawning areas has raised environmental concerns. Therefore , effluent effects on the development of anchoveta and sardine eggs were assessed by in vitro exposure. Eggs were sampled between 2007 and 2010 off Talcahuano , Chile. Subsequent toxicity tests ( 96 h duration , 12 °C) were performed using increasing effluent concentrations , a filtered seawater control , and two potassium dichromate concentrations ( to verify consistent embryonic sensitivity). Egg mortality and hatching success were evaluated. For anchoveta , mortality ( 9.9 ± 7.1 %) did not significantly differ among groups in five toxicity tests except the final toxicity test that showed significant differences in mortality ( 5.6 % control vs 27.8 % in 100 % effluent). For sardines , no differences in mortality existed between the effluent dilutions ( 2.6 ± 3.6 %) and control ( 6.3 ± 3.9 %). Notably , anchoveta egg survival and hatching success rates were inconsistent , i.e. , the highest rates of hatching failure occurred on the same sampling date with the highest rates of survival for the 100 % effluent group ( 72 %). In conclusion , the obtained results indicate that ( i) anchoveta egg mortality and hatching failure increase only under 100 % effluent exposure , coinciding with decreased egg quality near the end of spawning season and ( ii) high effluent dilutions not significantly increase sardine and anchoveta egg mortalities. Nevertheless , the recorded adverse effects to the hatching process should be studied in greater detail , particularly considering interspecific variability and the complexity of reproductive processes , especially during early development.
