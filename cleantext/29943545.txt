  Given the increasing exploitation of antibodies in different contexts such as molecular diagnostics and therapeutics , it would be beneficial to unravel properties of antigen-antibody interaction with modeling of computational protein-protein docking , especially , in the absence of a cocrystal structure. However , obtaining a native-like antigen-antibody structure remains challenging due in part to failing to reliably discriminate accurate from inaccurate structures among tens of thousands of decoys after computational docking with existing scoring function. We hypothesized that some important physicochemical and energetic features could be used to describe antigen-antibody interfaces and identify native-like antigen-antibody structure. We prepared a dataset , a subset of Protein-Protein Docking Benchmark Version 4.0 , comprising 37 nonredundant 3D structures of antigen-antibody complexes , and used it to train and test multivariate logistic regression equation which took several important physicochemical and energetic features of decoys as dependent variables. Our results indicate that the ability to identify native-like structures of our method is superior to ZRANK and ZDOCK score for the subset of antigen-antibody complexes. And then , we use our method in workflow of predicting epitope of anti-Ebola glycoprotein monoclonal antibody-4G7 and identify three accurate residues in its epitope.
