  The study aims to evaluate whether the postoperative outcome and the probability of complications of patients with total hip arthroplasty increases significantly when surgeons in training are in charge , assisted by a high volume surgeon , compared to a highly experienced orthopaedic surgeon , within the context of a high volume hospital certified to EndoCert. 192 patients with a primary hip arthroplasty were included. To assess the outcome , the Harris Hip Score , WOMAC , SF-36 and EuroQol-5D were surveyed pre- and 12 months postoperatively. As complications we considered the quality indicators defined by EndoCert. We found significant improvements in the postoperative score values with the qualifications of the surgeon in charge , even when a high volume surgeon or a surgeon in training was responsible. If a surgeon in training is assisted by a highly experienced surgeon , the risk of complications does not increase , although the operating time was significantly increased. Both the surgeon in training as well as the arthroplasty patient benefit from implementing the EndoCert system , because the postoperative outcome and the complication probability is independent of the qualifcation of the operating orthopaedic surgeon performing total hip arthroplasty when assisted by an experienced surgeon.
