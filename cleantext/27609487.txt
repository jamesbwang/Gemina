  Bismuth + proton pump inhibitor ( PPI) + amoxicillin + levofloxacin is one of the bismuth quadruple therapy regimens widely used for the eradication of H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection. The recommended dosage of levofloxacin is 500 mg once daily or 200 mg twice daily to eradicate H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection. The aim of the present open-label , randomized control trial was to compare the effectiveness , safety , and compliance of different dosages of levofloxacin used to cure Helicobacter<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive esomeprazole , amoxicillin , colloidal bismuth pectin and levofloxacin 500 mg once/day ( group A) or levofloxacin 200 mg twice/day ( group B) for 14 days. The primary outcome was the eradication rates in the intention-to-treat ( ITT) and per protocol ( PP) analyses. Overall , 400 patients were enrolled. The eradication rates in group A and group B were 77.5 % and 79.5 % respectively , in the ITT analysis , and 82.9 % and 86.4 % , respectively , in the PP analysis. No significant differences were found between two groups in terms of eradication rate , adverse effects or compliance. Oral levofloxacin 200 mg twice daily was similar in efficacy for eradicating H.<pathogen> pylori<pathogen> infection to oral levofloxacin 500 mg once daily but with lower mean total costs.
