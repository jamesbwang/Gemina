  Research indicates that many adolescents frequently use multiple substances. This study examines stability and transitions in the use and co-use of multiple substances ( cigarette , alcohol , marijuana , illicit drugs) from adolescence to young adulthood. Data were collected biennially from 662 youth in six assessments across ten years ( 2003-2013). We used latent class analysis ( LCA) to classify youth by substances used at each wave and used latent transition analysis ( LTA) to examine transition probabilities across waves. At each wave , a three-class model best fit the data. Classes included a poly-use class , that had the highest probabilities of use among all substances , a co-use class , that had high probabilities of use of alcohol and marijuana , and an alcohol-dominate class that started with low probabilities of use among all substances but showed increasing probabilities of alcohol use , at later ages. LTA showed that the probability of remaining in the poly-use class was the most stable from one wave to the next , followed by the alcohol-dominate class , and the co-use class. The most transitions occurred for the co-use class , with more individuals transitioning to the poly-use class than to the alcohol-dominate class. Strong stability among adolescent substance use classes was found between waves. Transitions were typically to classes using more substances , although , transitions to use fewer substances was evident for some individuals. Distinguishing stable and transitioning classes of substance use and co-use provides opportunities for prevention and intervention to disrupt high-risk use classes.
