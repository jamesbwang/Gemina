  Observational cohort study. To compare the rate of pedicle perforation while inserting screws ( PS) using O-arm navigation during surgery for scoliosis with that reported previously , and to determine risk factors specific to O-arm navigation. O-arm navigation provides intraoperative three-dimensional fluoroscopic imaging with an image quality similar to that of computed tomography. Surgeons have started using O-arm navigation in treatment of adolescent idiopathic sclerosis ( AIS). However , there are few reports of the perforation rate when using O-arm navigation to insert pedicle screws for AIS. To our knowledge , no information has been published regarding risk factors for pedicle perforation by PS when using O-arm navigation during surgery for AIS. We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 23 consecutive patients with AIS ( all female; mean age 15.4 years , range 12-19 years) who had all undergone PS fixation under O-arm navigation. There were 11 major pedicle perforations ( Grade 2 or 3) by the 404 screws ( 2.7 %). For both Grade 1-3 and Grade 2 or 3 perforations , the pedicle perforation rate by the ninth or subsequent screws was significantly higher than that for the other two groups ( screws 1-4 , 5-8) ( P < 0.01). Grade 1-3 , Grades 2 or 3 , and Grade 3 perforation rates after a previous perforation were significantly higher than those in patients without a previous perforation ( P < 0.01). The rate of screw deviation can increase significantly to 12.2 % after insertion of 8. The rate of major perforation of pedicles after inserting PS using O-arm navigation during surgery for AIS is relatively low. However , we recommend caution using intraoperative navigation after inserting 8 pedicle screws because after this , the trajectory deviation rate can increase significantly. 3.
