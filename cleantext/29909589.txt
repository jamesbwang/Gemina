  The FACTS 001 trial found that vaginal pre- and post-coital application of 1 % tenofovir gel did not prevent HIV-1 infection amongst young South African women. The trial included a multi-faceted approach to adherence support and collected objective and self-reported adherence measures. Using qualitative data collected from a random sub-set of FACTS 001 participants ( 135 in-depth interviews at product discontinuation and 13 focus group discussions at dissemination of trial results) , we explore the importance of ` place ' and ` timing ' in shaping acts of sexual intimacy and product adherence. Demographically , this qualitative sub-sample is similar to the trial cohort of predominantly young , unemployed women living with parents or other family members. Sexual intimacy was largely unpredictable and happened across multiple locations in which women had limited privacy , autonomy , or control over the timing of sex. This made adherence to the dosing strategy challenging. Findings may inform the development of future event-driven pre-exposure prophylaxis regimens or products.
