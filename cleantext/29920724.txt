  Afterdepolarizations cause triggered arrhythmias. One kind occurs after repolarization is complete , delayed afterdepolarizations ( DADs). Another occurs as an interruption in repolarization , early afterdepolarizations ( EADs). Afterdepolarizations initiate arrhythmias when they depolarize membrane potential to threshold potential for triggering action potentials. DADs usually occur mostly when Ca
