  Minimal hepatic encephalopathy ( MHE) , though highly prevalent , is a frequently underdiagnosed complication of cirrhosis of the liver. Because lack of time is reported as the major reason for non-testing , identifying patients at high risk of MHE would help in targeting them for screening. We aimed to determine the factors associated with MHE to help identify patient subgroups with a higher risk of MHE for targeted screening. Patients with cirrhosis of liver presenting between April 2015 and November 2016 were included. Those with a Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score ( PHES) of â‰¤ -5 points on psychometric testing were diagnosed to have MHE. Various demographic , clinical and laboratory parameters were included in a univariate and later multiple logistic regression models. Of the 180 ( male = 166 , 92.2 %) patients included 94 ( 52.2 %) had MHE. Though serum albumin , serum total bilirubin , serum aspartate aminotransferase , international normalized ration , Child-Turcotte-Pugh and Model-For-End-Stage-Liver-Disease scores were significant on univariate analysis , only CTP score was found to be significantly associated with MHE ( MHE is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis of liver and higher CTP scores independently predict the presence of MHE. Patients with CTP class B and C have a higher risk of suffering from MHE than CTP class A. Screening of patients in CTP class B and C is likely to increase the MHE detection rates while saving time , although select CTP class A patients may also need screening in view of public safety or poor quality of life.
