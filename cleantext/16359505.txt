  Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of natural hirudin and low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH) in the prevention of perioperative deep venous thrombosis ( DVT) in elderly patients with intertrochanteric fracture. From June 2014 to June 2017 , 96 patients with intertrochanteric fractures were treated with proximal femoral nail antirotation ( PFNA) were randomly divided into two groups. For DVT prevention , 45 patients were treated with oral natural hirudin and subcutaneous LMWH-calcium ( test group) and 51 patients were treated with subcutaneous LMWH-calcium ( control group). The mean intraoperative bleeding , wound<disease> drainage and incisional hematoma were higher in the test group , with no significant differences between the groups. There were significant differences in distal intramuscular venous thrombosis ( P = 0.043). Both activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT) , thrombin time ( TT) , and prothrombin time ( PT) lengthened in both groups postoperatively , and there was a significant difference between the two groups two weeks postoperatively. D-dimer were significantly different and platelet count ( PLT) did not differ between groups two weeks postoperatively. In elderly patients with unilateral intertrochanteric fracture after PFNA on anticoagulant therapy , the combination of natural hirudin and LMWH was more effective than that of LMWH-calcium alone , with no significant difference with regard to safety.
