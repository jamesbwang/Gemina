  The concept of mental health literacy suggests that higher literacy increases the likelihood of seeking treatment. However , previous studies mostly use vignettes , and do not investigate actual help-seeking behaviour. We assessed depression<symptom> literacy and type of mental illness in a convenience sample of 207 adults with currently untreated mental health problems from the general population. Our analysis sample comprised 152 adults ( M Depression<symptom> literacy was lower in men and older participants , and higher in participants with prior treatment experience. Depression<symptom> literacy was negatively linked to informal help-seeking ( aOR = 0.33 ( 0.13; 0.84)) when included as a dichotomous predictor ( i.e. , ` high ' versus ` low ' literacy). Our sample was small , thus we did not differentiate between types of depressive disorders in our analysis. We could not corroborate most postulated associations between depression<symptom> literacy and help-seeking , except for the negative association with informal help. Our findings underline differences between previous vignette-based and community-based investigations of the help-seeking process for mental health problems. To explore underlying mechanisms , future research should investigate the role of intermediary variables and processes in the association between depression<symptom> literacy and help-seeking , such as self-efficacy and symptom attribution , which might be more clinically relevant in help-seeking for depressive symptoms.
