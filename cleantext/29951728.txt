  The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib , carfilzomib , and ixazomib , which are used in the treatment of multiple myeloma have greatly improved response rates. Several other proteasome inhibitors , including delanzomib and oprozomib , are in clinical trials. Carfilzomib and oprozomib are epoxyketones that form an irreversible bond with the 20S proteasome , whereas bortezomib , ixazomib , and delanzomib are boronic acids that form slowly reversible adducts. Several of the proteasome inhibitors have been shown to exhibit specific cardiac toxicities. A primary neonatal rat myocyte model was used to study the relative myocyte-damaging effects of five proteasome inhibitors with a view to identifying potential class differences and the effect of inhibitor binding kinetics. Bortezomib was shown to induce the most myocyte damage followed by delanzomib , ixazomib , oprozomib , and carfilzomib. The sensitivity of myocytes to proteasome inhibitors , which contain high levels of chymotrypsin-like proteasomal activity , may be due to inhibition of proteasomal-dependent ongoing sarcomeric protein turnover. All inhibitors inhibited the chymotrypsin-like proteasomal activity of myocyte lysate in the low nanomolar concentration range and exhibited time-dependent inhibition kinetics characteristic of slow-binding inhibitors. Progress curve analysis of the inhibitor concentration dependence of the slow-binding kinetics was used to measure second-order `` on '' rate constants for binding. The second-order rate constants varied by 90-fold , with ixazomib reacting the fastest , and oprozomib the slowest. As a group , the boronic acid drugs were more damaging to myocytes than the epoxyketone drugs. Overall , inhibitor-induced myocyte damage was positively , but not significantly , correlated with their second-order rate constants.
