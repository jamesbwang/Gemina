  Cannabis use initiated during adolescence might precipitate negative consequences in adulthood. Thus , predicting adolescent cannabis use prior to any exposure will inform the etiology of substance abuse by disentangling predictors from consequences of use. In this prediction study , data were drawn from the IMAGEN sample , a longitudinal study of adolescence. All selected participants ( n = 1,581) were cannabis-naïve at age 14. Those reporting any cannabis use ( out of 6 ordinal use levels) by age 16 were included in the outcome group ( N = 365 , males n = 207). Cannabis-naïve participants at age 14 and 16 were included in the comparison group ( N = 1,216 , males n = 538). Psychosocial , brain , and genetic features were measured at age 14 prior to any exposure. Cross-validated regularized logistic regressions for each use level by sex were used to perform feature selection and obtain prediction error statistics on independent observations. Predictors were probed for sex- and drug-specificity using post-hoc logistic regressions. Models reliably predicted use as indicated by satisfactory prediction error statistics , and contained psychosocial features common to both sexes. However , males and females exhibited distinct brain predictors that failed to predict use in the opposite sex or predict binge drinking in independent samples of same-sex participants. Collapsed across sex , genetic variation on catecholamine and opioid receptors marginally predicted use. Using machine learning techniques applied to a large multimodal dataset , we identified a risk profile containing psychosocial and sex-specific brain prognostic markers , which were likely to precede and influence cannabis initiation.
