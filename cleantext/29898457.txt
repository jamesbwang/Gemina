  Spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR) represent a model of essential hypertension. We studied the effect of amlodipine ( AML) on bone markers , bone mineral density ( BMD) , and biomechanical properties of osteopenic bone induced by orchidectomy in male SHR. Rats were allocated to 3 groups and were sacrificed after 12 weeks: sham-operated control; orchidectomised control; and orchidectomised receiving a diet supplemented with AML. Indicators of bone turnover were assessed in bone homogenate , BMD was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry , and the femurs were subjected to biomechanical testing. Long-term AML administration does not have a negative impact on bone metabolism and density in male SHR.
