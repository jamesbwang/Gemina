  Physical unclonable functions are the physical equivalent of one-way mathematical transformations that , upon external excitation , can generate irreversible responses. Exceeding their mathematical counterparts , their inherent physical complexity renders them resilient to cloning and reverse engineering. When these features are combined with their time-invariant and deterministic operation , the necessity to store the responses ( keys) in non-volatile means can be alleviated. This pivotal feature , makes them critical components for a wide range of cryptographic-authentication applications , where sensitive data storage is restricted. In this work , a physical unclonable function based on a single optical waveguide is experimentally and numerically validated. The system 's responses consist of speckle-like images that stem from mode-mixing and scattering events of multiple guided transverse modes. The proposed configuration enables the system 's response to be simultaneously governed by multiple physical scrambling mechanisms , thus offering a radical performance enhancement in terms of physical unclonability compared to conventional optical implementations. Additional features like physical re-configurability , render our scheme suitable for demanding authentication applications.
