  Daily self-weighing ( DSW) and daily activity tracking ( DAT) are useful strategies for preventing weight gain among African American breast cancer survivors. However , self-monitoring behaviors vary over time , increasing risk of weight gain. This study explored the association of nonadherence to DSW and DAT with corresponding weight fluctuations among African American breast cancer survivors. Using data from a 6-month randomized controlled trial , we conducted a secondary data analysis among women randomized into a DSW group ( n = 13) and a DSW+DAT group ( n = 11). DSW and DAT were captured from wireless scale and activity tracker data. Nonadherence to DSW was defined as one or more days without a weight measurement , and nonadherence to DAT was defined as one or more days without activity tracking. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine weight fluctuations in relation to nonadherence to DSW and DAT. Data analysis occurred from September 2016-April 2017. Over the 6-month study period , women provided 119.2 ± 46.0 weight measurements and 121.9 ± 53.2 days of physical activity tracking. Nonadherence to DSW was associated with weight fluctuations. For every 1-day increase in nonadherence to DSW , weight increased by 0.031 kg ( 95 % CI: 0.012 , 0.050; p < 0.01). Additionally , during periods of DSW and DAT weight<symptom> decreased by 0.028 kg ( 95 % CI: -0.042 , -0.014; p < 0.001) and 0.017 kg ( 95 % CI: -0.030; -0.004) respectively. Our findings suggest that nonadherence to DSW was associated with weight gain among breast cancer survivors. Weight<symptom> loss<symptom> was enhanced during periods of DSW and DAT.
