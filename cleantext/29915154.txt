  Zinc finger protein 521 ( ZFP521) , a DNA-binding protein containing 30 Kr√ºppel-like zinc fingers , has been implicated in the differentiation of multiple cell types , including hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPC) and B lymphocytes. Here , we report a novel role for ZFP521 in regulating the earliest stages of hematopoiesis and lymphoid cell development via a cell-extrinsic mechanism. Mice with inactivated
