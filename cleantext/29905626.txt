  To describe a midshaft forearm fracture pattern that places the ulnar nerve at risk in the pediatric population and provide seven clinical case examples describing the injury pattern and treatment methods. Retrospective observational case series , review of literature , cadaver dissection , and treatment recommendations. Multi-institutional , Southeast United States PATIENTS:: Seven pediatric patients ( 5 male , 2 female) with mean age of 8.7 years ( range , 3-14) who sustained a significantly displaced closed , or grade I open , middle to distal one-third both bone forearm fracture with subsequent ulnar nerve<symptom> dysfunction<symptom>. Manual reduction and casting of both bone forearm shaft fractures , operative debridement , fracture fixation , nerve exploration , neurolysis , nerve repair and nerve grafting. Radiographic fracture union , clinical ulnar nerve<symptom> motor and sensory function testing , along with selective electric nerve testing and advanced imaging were monitored throughout follow up post-injury. Five of seven patients underwent surgical treatment and two others were treated with conservative measures. The ulnar nerve was entrapped within the fracture site of one patient with an open fracture along with partial nerve transection , and four patients were found to have the nerve encased in hypertrophic scar tissue or bony callus upon surgical exploration at 3 to 12 months post-injury. The ulnar nerve lies in a precarious position in the middle to distal one-third forearm and is bound by anatomic constraints that place the nerve at risk of injury. This article offers a treatment algorithm that includes conservative treatment , acute exploration , early exploration ( â‰¤ 3 months) , and late exploration ( > 3 months).
