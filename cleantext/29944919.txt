  Retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs) were one of the first classes of sensory neurons to be described in terms of a receptive field ( RF). Over the last six decades , our understanding of the diversity of RGC types and the nuances of their response properties has grown exponentially. We will review the current understanding of RGC receptive fields ( RFs) mostly from studies in mammals , but including work from other vertebrates as well. We will argue for a new paradigm that embraces the fluidity of RGC RFs with an eye toward the neuroethology of vision. Specifically , we will focus on ( 1) different methods for measuring RGC RFs , ( 2) RF models , ( 3) feature selectivity and the distinction between fluid and stable RF properties , and ( 4) ideas about the future of understanding RGC RFs.
