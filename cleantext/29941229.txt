  The aim of this systematic review was to identify randomized , placebo-controlled clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of corticosteroids in the control of pain , oedema , and trismus following third molar surgery , and to analyse the effects of the type of drug administered and the time and route of drug administration on the outcomes of interest. Searches were performed in the PubMed , Scopus , and Cochrane Library databases. This review was structured according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The search identified 1223 studies. After assessing eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria , 17 studies were selected for the qualitative analysis ( a total of 730 patients aged 15-45 years). Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis , which was performed using Review Manager software. The corticosteroids were effective in controlling pain ( P = 0.002; mean difference -17.38 , 95 % confidence interval -24.81 to -9.95) and trismus ( P < 0.00001; mean difference 6.10 , 95 % confidence interval 3.42 to 8.77). With the exception of the submucosal route , the route of administration did not appear to affect the outcomes. The administration of a corticosteroid in the preoperative phase was superior to its use in the postoperative phase for the control of trismus.
