  Myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPNs) are clonal disorders characterized by proliferation of one or more elements of the myeloid lineage. Key genetic aberrations include the BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangement in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia<disease> ( CML) and JAK2/MPL/CALR aberrations in Philadelphia chromosome-negative MPNs. While thought to be mutually exclusive , occasional isolated reports of coexistence of BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 , and JAK2 with MPL or CALR aberrations have been described. Given the paucity of data , clinical characteristics and outcome of patients harboring concurrent Philadelphia-positive and Philadelphia-negative mutations or dual Philadelphia-negative driver mutations have not been systematically evaluated , and their clinical relevance is largely unknown. It is difficult to determine the true relevance of co-existing driver mutations on outcomes given the rarity of its occurrence. In this case series , we describe those patients who had dual driver mutations detected at any point during the course of their disease and characterized their clinical and laboratory features , bone<disease> marrow pathology , and overall disease course.
