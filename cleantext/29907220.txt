  The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma ( AAST) developed emergency general surgery ( EGS) grading systems for multiple diseases to standardize classification of disease severity. The grading system for breast<disease> infections<disease> has not been validated. We aimed to validate the AAST breast<disease> infection<disease> grading system. Multi-institutional retrospective review of all adult patients with a breast<disease> infection<disease> diagnosis at Mayo Clinic Rochester 1/2015 - 10/2015 and Pietermaritzburg South African Hospital 1/2010- 4/2016 was performed. AAST EGS grades were assigned by two independent reviewers. Inter-rater reliability was measured using the agreement statistic ( kappa). Final AAST grade was correlated with patient and treatment factors using Pearson 's correlation coefficient. Two hundred twenty-five patients were identified: grade I ( n = 152 , 67.6 %) , II ( n = 44 , 19.6 %) , III ( n = 25 , 11.1 %) , IV ( n = 0 , 0.0 %) , and V ( n = 4 , 1.8 %). At Mayo Clinic Rochester , AAST grades ranged from I-III. The kappa was 1.0 , demonstrating 100 % agreement between reviewers. Within the South African patients , grades included II , III , and V , with a kappa of 0.34 , due to issues of the grading system application to this patient population. Treatment received correlated with AAST grade; less severe breast<disease> infections<disease> ( grade I-II) received more oral antibiotics ( correlation ( -0.23 , P = 0.0004)) , however , higher AAST grades ( III) received more intravenous antibiotics ( correlation 0.29 , P < 0.0001). The AAST EGS breast<disease> infection<disease> grading system demonstrates reliability and ease for disease classification , and correlates with required treatment , in patients presenting with low-to-moderate severity infections at an academic medical center; however , it needs further refinement before being applicable to patients with more severe disease presenting for treatment in low-/ middle-income countries.
