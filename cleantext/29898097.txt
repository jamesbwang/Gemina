  Pantanal da Nhecolândia is one of the most well-preserved areas in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul. Located in the southern part of the Taquari River megafan , it is in tectonic contact with the fault escarpments of the Maracaju-Campo Grande plateaus to the east and with the fault escarpments of the Bodoquena plateau to the west<disease> , which continue to north. To the south and to the north , the limits are marked respectively by the lineaments of the Negro and Taquari Rivers. Nhecolândia is characterized by the existence of at least 17,631 lagoons , 17,050 ( 96.70 %) of which are of fresh water ( baías) and 577 ( 3.3 %) of salty water ( salinas). Studies based on ( Landsat) satellite images and use of free software ( QGIS , version 2.8.3) and GIS ( Geographic Information Systems) revealed that the major axes of the lagoons are aligned along two directions , NE ( 62.49 %) and NW ( 37.51 %) , with modes concentrated between N30-40E and N30-40W , suggesting in both cases the role played by tectonic control ( neotectonics) in their formation. Evidences of fluvial origin are presented for these groups of lagoons , as well as for their tectonic alignment.
