  Spleen tyrosine kinase ( SYK) is a cytosolic non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase. Because SYK mediates key receptor signaling pathways involving the B cell receptor and Fc receptors , SYK is an attractive target for autoimmune disease and cancer treatments. To date , representative oral SYK inhibitors , including fostamatinib ( R406 or R788) , entospletinib ( GS-9973) , cerdulatinib ( PRT062070) , and TAK-659 , have been assessed in clinical trials. Here , we report the crystal structures of SYK in complex with two newly developed inhibitors possessing 4-aminopyrido ( 4,3-D) pyrimidine moieties ( SKI-G-618 and SKI-O-85). One SYK inhibitor ( SKI-G-618) exhibited moderate inhibitory activity against SYK , whereas the other inhibitor ( SKI-O-85) exhibited a low inhibitory profile against SYK. Binding mode analysis indicates that a highly potent SYK inhibitor might be developed by modifying and optimizing the functional groups that interact with Leu377 , Gly378 , and Val385 in the G-loop and the nearby region in SYK. In agreement with our structural analysis , one of our SYK inhibitor ( SKI-G-618) shows strong inhibitory activities on the
