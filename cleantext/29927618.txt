  Long-term survival of allo- and xenotransplanted immune-privileged Sertoli cells ( SCs) is well documented suggesting that SCs can be used to deliver foreign proteins for cell-based gene therapy. The aim of this study was to use a lentivirus carrying proinsulin cDNA to achieve stable expression and lowering of blood glucose levels ( BGLs). A SC line transduced with the lentivirus ( MSC-LV-mI) maintained stable insulin expression in vitro. These MSC-LV-mI cells were transplanted and grafts were analyzed for cell survival , continued proinsulin mRNA , and insulin protein expression. All grafts contained MSC-LV-mI cells that expressed proinsulin mRNA and insulin protein. Transplantation of MSC-LV-mI cells into diabetic mice significantly lowered BGLs for 4 days after transplantation. Interestingly , in three transplanted SCID mice and one transplanted BALB/c mouse , the BGLs again significantly lowered by day 50 and 70 , respectively. This is the first time SC transduced with a lentiviral vector was able to stably express insulin and lower BGLs. In conclusion , a SC line can be modified to stably express therapeutic proteins ( e.g. , insulin) , thus taking us one step further in the use of SCs as an immune-privileged vehicle for cell-based gene therapy.
