  Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( hDHODH) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis , the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate. hDHODH has recently been found to be associated with acute myelogenous leukemia<disease> , a disease for which the standard of intensive care has not changed over decades. This work presents a novel class of hDHODH inhibitors , which are based on an unusual carboxylic group bioisostere 2-hydroxypyrazolo ( 1,5- a) pyridine , that has been designed starting from brequinar , one of the most potent hDHODH inhibitors. A combination of structure-based and ligand-based strategies produced compound 4 , which shows brequinar-like hDHODH potency in vitro and is superior in terms of cytotoxicity and immunosuppression. Compound 4 also restores myeloid differentiation in leukemia<disease> cell lines at concentrations that are one log digit lower than those achieved in experiments with brequinar. This Article reports the design , synthesis , SAR , X-ray crystallography , biological assays , and physicochemical characterization of the new class of hDHODH inhibitors.
