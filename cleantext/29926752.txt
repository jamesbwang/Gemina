  Several ADHD pharmacological trials reported high placebo response ( PR) rates. This study aims to characterize the PR in adult ADHD. A retrospective cohort analysis of the placebo arm ( 140 adults with ADHD , 18-55 yrs , M: F 46.4 % -53.6 %) of a 6-week randomized , multicenter , double-blind metadoxine study , using Conners ' Adult ADHD Rating Scale ( CAARS) and the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale ( ASRS) , was conducted. Pre-post changes in placebo-treated adults were significant for both the CAARS and ASRS , F ( 2.9 , 404.5) = 61.2 , p < .00001 , F ( 2.8 , 383.0) = 43.1 , p < .00001 , respectively. Less than half of the participants had a PR which began early in treatment and persisted; almost 50 % had a variable , inconsistent PR. In the current sample , PR in adult ADHD was prominent on both symptom scales and the investigator-rater instrument. Therefore , using investigator ratings as a primary endpoint does not necessarily attenuate PR. Of note , about half of the PR is variable , suggesting unreliable determination of efficacy.
