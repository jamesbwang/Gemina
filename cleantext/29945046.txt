  Photocatalysis and photocatalytic ozonation under visible light have been applied for the purification of a complex aqueous matrix such as the grey water of Masdar City ( UAE) , by using N-doped brookite-rutile catalysts. Preliminary runs on 4-nitrophenol ( 4-NP) solutions allowed to test the reaction system in the presence of a model pollutant and to afford the relevant kinetic parameters of the process. Subsequently , the remediation of grey water effluent has been evaluated in terms of the reduction of total organic carbon ( TOC) and bacterial counts. The concentration of the most abundant inorganic ionic species in the effluent has been also monitored during reaction. Photocatalytic ozonation under visible light allowed to reduce the TOC content of the grey water by ca. 60 % in the optimized experimental conditions and to reduce the total bacterial count by ca. 97 %. The extent of TOC mineralization reached ca. 80 % when the photocatalytic ozonation occurred downstream to a preliminary electro-membrane bioreactor ( eMBR). Coupling the two processes enhanced the global efficiency. In fact , the eMBR treatment lowered the turbidity and the organic load of the effluent entering the photocatalytic ozonation treatment , which in turn enhanced the extent of purification and disinfection.
