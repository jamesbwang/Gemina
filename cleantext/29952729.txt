  A meningococcal serogroup<pathogen> B ( MenB) outbreak at a large public university prompted an emergency response to immunize undergraduates. Activation of the emergency plan and points of dispensing required cooperation of many units on campus under the leadership of university health officials. Significant efforts to provide consistent messages to students and parents regarding the outbreak and the availability of the MenB vaccines were provided by the student health services and university communications. The university 's existing emergency medication distribution plan was modified to guide vaccine administration. Volunteers were recruited to staff the clinics alongside university healthcare providers. Significant support was provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , state division of public health and the city-county health department. Over 22,000 doses of vaccine were administered reaching approximately two-thirds of the undergraduate population. We report our experience and lessons learned which may be helpful to other large universities in preventing and responding to disease outbreaks.
