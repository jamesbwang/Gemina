  An efficient nickel-catalyzed C-H trifluoromethylation for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated free anilines using Togni 's reagent has been developed. This approach exhibits a good functional group tolerance , good regioselectivity , and chemoselectivity under mild conditions. The newly developed economical one-step method is a better alternative to synthesize trifluoromethylated free anilines.
