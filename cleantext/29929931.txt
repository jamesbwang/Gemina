  MitraClip implantation has evolved as a new tool for treatment of inoperable or high-risk patients with severe functional mitral regurgitation ( FMR) due to dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM). Limited data are available regarding MitraClip outcomes comparing patients with ischemic and non-ischemic DCM. From 2008 to 2016 , 314 patients received MitraClip for FMR at four institutions: Brescia , Zurich and Milan. Patients were stratified according to MR aetiology in non-ischemic FMR ( n = 99) and ischemic FMR ( n = 215). Preoperative risk factors , operative variables and outcomes up to 2-year were evaluated. A multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards survival model with covariate adjustments was used to assess the relationship between FMR aetiology and 2-year cardiac mortality. As expected , patients with ischemic FMR had significantly more risk factors and comorbidities. Overall procedural success rate was 80 % and in-hospital cardiac mortality was 3 % without significant differences between aetiology. Two-year overall ( 25 % vs. 19 % , p = 0.574) and cardiac ( 18 % vs. 16 % , p = 0.990) mortality rates were comparable. No differences were detected in terms of re-hospitalization rates ( 32 %) , LVAD implantation ( 4.5 %) and mitral valve surgery ( 1 %). LVEF ≤ 25 % , LVEDV > 216 ml , NT-proBNP ≥ 10.000 pg/ml and AF were the strongest baseline predictors of 2-year cardiac mortality. Greater improvements of 6MWT and NYHA functional class were observed in patients with non-ischemic FMR. The ischemic or non-ischemic aetiology of DCM did not affect in-hospital and 2-year cardiac mortality after MitraClip in patients with FMR. In case of unfavorable baseline clinical condition , the indication for MitraClip should be carefully weighed in favour of conservative medical therapy alone or left ventricular assist device.
