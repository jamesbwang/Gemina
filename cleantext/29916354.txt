  Non-infectious uveitis is a heterogeneous collection of inflammatory eye diseases and is one of the most important causes of blindness<symptom> among active adults in developed countries. Inflammation<symptom> control is crucial in the prevention of ocular structural and functional damage. Regarding acute inflammatory control , corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment. Several types of intra-ocular corticosteroids have been used with the aim of enhanced efficacy compared to their topical or peri-ocular administration , while minimizing its adverse effects associated with the systemic administration. The purpose of this Cochrane review was to synthetize the available evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid implants in comparison with standard treatment. Due to the heterogeneity in the design of the studies and outcome measures assessed , authors could not conclude that implants are superior to traditional systemic therapy in Non-infectious uveitis. The safety analysis suggested increased risks of post-implant surgery for cataract and high intraocular pressure compared with standard-of-care therapy.
