  Aggression and violence are social behaviors that exact a significant toll on human societies. Individuals with aggressive tendencies display deficits in effortful control , particularly in affectively charged situations. However , not all individuals with poor effortful control are aggressive. This study uses event-related potentials ( ERPs) recorded from a large sample ( n = 75 undergraduates) to decompose the chronology of neural mechanisms underlying the ability to effortfully-control behavior , and then explores whether deficits in these cognitive functions might then lead to aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom>. This study investigated which ERPs moderate the effortful control- aggression association. We examined three successive ERP components , the P2 , N2 , and P3 , which have been associated with attentional orienting , response conflict , and working memory updating , for stimuli that required effortful control. N2 amplitudes were larger for trials requiring a switch from a preplanned action strategy than trials where a preplanned action strategy was followed. Furthermore , results indicated that N2 activation , but not P2 or P3 activation , moderated the relationship between effortful control and aggression. Our results suggest that small ( less negative) N2s moderate the association between effortful control and aggression. These effects were present only in negative contexts , and only for high-conflict trials. Results suggest that individual differences in neural processing efficiency contributes to the execution of effortfully controlled behavior and avoidance of aggression.
