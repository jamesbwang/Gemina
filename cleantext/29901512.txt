  According to the new World Health Organization 2016 classification for tumors of the central nervous system , 1p/19q codeletion defines the genetic hallmark that differentiates oligodendrogliomas from diffuse astrocytomas. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether relative cerebral blood volume ( rCBV) and apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) histogram analysis can stratify survival in adult patients with genetic defined diffuse glioma grades II and III. Sixty-seven patients with untreated diffuse gliomas World Health Organization grades II and III and known 1p/19q codeletion status were included retrospectively and analyzed using ADC and rCBV maps based on whole-tumor volume histograms. Overall survival and progression-free survival ( PFS) were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier and Cox survival analyses adjusted for known survival predictors. Significant longer PFS was associated with homogeneous rCBV distribution-higher rCBVpeak ( median , 37 vs 26 months; hazard ratio ( HR) , 3.2; P = 0.02) in patients with astrocytomas , and heterogeneous rCBV distribution-lower rCBVpeak ( median , 46 vs 37 months; HR , 5.3; P < 0.001) and higher rCBVmean ( median , 44 vs 39 months; HR , 7.9; P = 0.003) in patients with oligodendrogliomas. Apparent diffusion coefficient parameters ( ADCpeak , ADCmean) did not stratify PFS and overall survival. Tumors with heterogeneous perfusion signatures and high average values were associated with longer PFS in patients with oligodendrogliomas. On the contrary , heterogeneous perfusion distribution was associated with poor outcome in patients with diffuse astrocytomas.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 ( CCBY-NC-ND) , where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
