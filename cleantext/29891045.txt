  Thrombus in the heart is known to be one of the many sequelae of anterior wall myocardial infarction , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> and coagulation disorders. However , biventricular thrombi are relatively rarely found , even in conditions with a high possibility of thrombus formation. We report the case of a 75-year-old-woman with newly diagnosed systolic heart<symptom> failure<symptom> secondary to a nonischemic cardiomyopathy , who was found to have large biventricular thrombi. Further coagulopathy work-up revealed that she was heterozygous for the prothrombin 20210G/A and homozygous for the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR) 677C/T mutations. We , herein , review and discuss previous case reports and published literature regarding ventricular thrombosis and its treatment. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first case of biventricular thrombosis with prothrombin 20210G/A and MTHFR 677C/T mutations.
