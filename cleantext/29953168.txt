  Amniotic fluid obtained via amniocentesis provides a source of fetal material used in prenatal diagnosis. The fluid may be used directly for biochemical analyses , fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) , and isolation of DNA for molecular studies , including chromosomal microarray analysis ( CMA). The fluid is typically cultured as a source of metaphase cells for chromosome analysis and to provide additional material for biochemical and DNA-based testing. This unit describes an in situ method for the preparation , culture , and harvest of amniotic fluid samples for metaphase chromosome analysis. Cells are grown , harvested for metaphase spreads , and analyzed on glass coverslips. The unit also describes methods to obtain cells for additional studies ( such as molecular genetic analyses) by growing cells in flasks either following passaging of cells from a glass coverslip culture or by directly establishing a flask culture from the amniotic fluid specimen. When cells are grown in flasks , they must be removed from the flask with trypsin before they can be used in studies. Lastly , this unit describes a method for isolating DNA for CMA from uncultured amniotic fluid and cultured cells. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
