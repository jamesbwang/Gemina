  Cytomegalovirus can cause severe disease with adverse outcome in immunocompromised patients. Severe cytomegalovirus infection in previously healthy individuals is rare. Here we present an unusual case of cytomegalovirus infection with neurological and pulmonary involvement in a previously healthy young woman with no history of immuno-suppression. Unfortunately , the disease followed a malignant course and despite the efforts of the medical staff the patient died. CMV infection should be considered in the diagnostic work-up of immunocompetent patients with fever<disease> and unexplained neurological or pulmonary manifestations. Although uncertainty exists regarding the optimal treatment of CMV in healthy individuals , early recognition and administration of ganciclovir may prevent a fatal outcome.
