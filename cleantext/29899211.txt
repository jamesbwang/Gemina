  Thaumatin-like protein from banana ( designated BanTLP) has been purified by employing a simple protocol consisting of diethylaminoethyl Sephadex ( DEAE ‚Åª Sephadex) chromatography , gel filtration on Sephadex G50 , and reversed-phase chromatography. The purified protein was identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry , with an estimated molecular weight of 22.1 kDa. BanTLP effectively inhibited in vitro spore germination of
