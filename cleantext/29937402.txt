  An increasing percentage of children are born to couples who cohabit but are not legally married. Using data from a nationally representative Canadian sample , we estimated associations of maternal marital and cohabitation status with stillbirth<symptom> , infant mortality , preterm birth ( PTB) , and small- and large-for-gestational-age ( SGA and LGA) birth. The 2006 Canadian Birth-Census Cohort was created by linking birth registration data with the 2006 long-form census. We used log-binomial regression to estimate risk ratios ( RRs) for adverse birth outcomes associated with being single or living with a common-law partner. Analyses were adjusted for maternal age and education. Data were analyzed for 130,931 singleton births. Adjusted RRs ( 95 % confidence intervals) for single mothers compared with married mothers were 1.92 ( 1.51-2.42) for stillbirth<symptom> , 2.08 ( 1.55-2.81) for infant mortality , 1.36 ( 1.27-1.46) for PTB , 1.31 ( 1.22-1.39) for SGA birth , and 0.95 ( 0.90-1.01) for LGA birth. Adjusted RRs for cohabiting mothers compared with married mothers were 0.93 ( 0.74-1.16) for stillbirth<symptom> , 1.05 ( 0.81-1.35) for infant mortality , 1.09 ( 1.03-1.15) for PTB , 1.05 ( 0.99-1.10) for SGA birth , and 0.96 ( 0.92-1.00) for LGA birth. In a nationally representative Canadian birth cohort , cohabiting and legally married women experienced similar birth outcomes , but most outcomes for single women were substantially worse.
