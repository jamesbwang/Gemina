  This study is aimed at validating the dimensional internalizing and externalizing approach to personality in a sample of adolescents with suicidal behavior and analyzing the psychopathological and syndromic differences between adolescents from each dimension. It is a descriptive and cross-sectional study of 75 adolescents ( 75 % women) who attended the emergency service of a pediatric hospital due to suicidal behavior. Sociodemographic , clinical and psychopathological data and personality profiles ( MACI) were gathered. The factorial analysis found two factors ( total variance of 77.65 %): an internalizing ( 28 % of the cases) and an externalizing profile ( 72 % of the cases). Statistically significant differences were obtained between the two profiles in the expressed concerns and the clinical syndromes<disease> of the MACI. Two differentiated personality profiles were found in our sample of adolescents with suicidal behavior. The externalizing profile was more prevalent. These profiles should guide clinical decisions and help plan therapeutic interventions to reduce the risk of suicidal behavior relapse.
