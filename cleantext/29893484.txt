  Endocrinopathy due to iron overload is the most common morbidity whereas myocardial siderosis causing toxic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of mortality among patients with transfusion dependent thalassemia major ( TDTM). If detected early , this can be treated with aggressive chelation. T2 * cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR) guided chelation protocols are now the gold standard but have limited availability in low and middle-income countries. We hypothesized that markers of endocrine dysfunction would correlate with T2 * CMR and can be used to predict the severity of myocardial siderosis and guide chelation therapy. We undertook a multicenter retrospective study of 280 patients with TDTM to assess the prevalence of endocrinopathies and the predictive value of a number of individual and composite markers of endocrinopathy with T2 * CMR. The prevalence of hypogonadism , stunting , hypoparathyroidism , and hypothyroidism was 82 % , 69 % , 40 % , and 30 % , respectively. The sensitivity of hypogonadism and stunting predicting severe myocardial siderosis was 90 % and 80 % , respectively. We conclude that clinical markers of endocrine dysfunction , especially hypogonadism ( positive likelihood ratio ( LR +) = 1.4 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 1.0-1.9; positive predictive value ( PPV) = 77 % , 95 % CI = 70-82; negative predictive value ( NPV) = 57 % , 95 % CI = 34-77) and stunting ( LR + = 1.3 , 95 % CI = 1.1-1.6; PPV = 64 % , 95 % CI = 60-69; NPV = 55 % , 95 % CI = 45-64) in TDTM can predict severe myocardial siderosis and can potentially guide chelation therapy , especially where access to T2 * CMR is limited.
