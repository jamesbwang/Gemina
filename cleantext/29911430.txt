  Understanding the link between HIV<pathogen> knowledge , risky sexual behaviors , and social intolerance such as stigma and discrimination is important for HIV<pathogen> prevention and treatment program planning. We investigated whether intolerant attitudes and practices among Ugandan adults were associated with HIV-transmission knowledge. We analyzed data from a nationally representative population-based household survey , the 2011 Uganda AIDS Indicator Survey. A total of 15,526 participants who responded to questions on HIV<pathogen> knowledge , social intolerance and risky sexual behavior were included in this analysis. Results show that 34.8 % of respondents reported having fear of casual contact with people living with HIV<pathogen> ( PLWA) , 21 % blame PLWAs for their disease , 62 % would not want HIV<pathogen> infection in their family disclosed , while 25 % reported engaging in risky sexual behaviors. After adjusting for age , sex , residence , and level of education , people with low HIV-transmission knowledge had almost three-fold higher odds of fear of casual contact with a PLWA ( aOR = 2.70 , 95 % CI = 2.33-3.13) , and had 30 % higher odds of HIV-related stigmatizing attitudes ( aOR = 1.29 , 95 % CI = 1.07-1.54). Further , they had 47 % higher odds of having sex under the influence of alcohol ( aOR = 1.47 , 95 % CI = 1.25-1.73) and 40 % higher odds of having unprotected sex with any of their last three sex partners ( aOR = 1.39 , 95 % CI = 1.06-1.89). Our findings show that intolerant attitudes such as stigma still persist , particularly among people with low HIV-transmission knowledge. Improving knowledge about HIV/AIDS can foster positive attitudes and building safe practices among populations , and is critical for improving prevention and treatment programs.
