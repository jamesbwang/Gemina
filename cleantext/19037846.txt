  To assess the homodigital flap surgical procedure , as well as the function of the finger , pain , sensation , esthetics , and patient satisfaction. Retrospective analysis of records and questionnaires of patients who underwent this surgical technique between the months of May 2013 and October 2016. Eight were included in the study , with an average follow-up period of 23 months. Patients with digital pulp lesions<symptom> of the thumbs and those who did not perform rehabilitation were excluded. All underwent the two-point discrimination test , the Semmes-Weinstein test , and range of motion evaluation. The age varied from 22 to 59 years ( average of 32.9) , six ( 75 %) being male patients. Three patients ( 37.5 %) had involvement of the right hand and five of the left ( 62.5 %). Regarding the etiology , seven suffered injury and one a chemical burn. The average distance obtained from the two-point discrimination test was 7.3 mm. All patients who underwent the Semmes-Weinstein test obtained response to the purple filament. The average sum of the range of motion of the affected digit was 98.9 %. The flap area was on average 294.4 mm The homodigital flap technique presented satisfactory esthetics and functional results regarding feasibility , sensation , and digital mobility in pulp
