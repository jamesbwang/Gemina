  1. The purpose of this study was to clarify the mechanism of DSP-1053 time-dependent inhibition ( TDI) for CYP1A2. 2. DSP-1053 inhibited time- and concentration-dependently CYP1A2 activity in human liver microsomes even in a dilution assay. However , DSP-1053 was not metabolized by recombinant human CYP1A2. These findings indicate that the inhibitory effect of DSP-1053 on CYP1A2 does not follow a general mechanism-based inhibition ( MBI) because it did not seem to be a suicide substrate. 3. In fact , CYP1A2 was not inhibited with DSP-1053 pre-incubation in recombinant human CYP1A2. On the other hand , CYP1A2 was potently inhibited after pre-incubation with DSP-1053 in a mixture of human recombinant CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. In addition , DSP-1053 TDI of CYP1A2 in human liver microsomes was drastically reduced not only by addition of a CYP3A4 inhibitor , but also by addition of potassium cyanide ( KCN) , which is a trapping agent for iminium ions. We also confirmed in this study that CYP1A2 suicide inhibition by DSP-1053 metabolites generated by CYP3A4 had only minimal role in DSP-1053 TDI of CYP1A2. 4. In conclusion , a possible mechanism for DSP-1053 TDI of CYP1A2 is that DSP-1053 iminium ion , which is generated by CYP3A4 , departs from CYP3A4 without inhibiting it and covalently binds to CYP1A2.
