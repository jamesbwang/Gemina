  Invasive mechanical ventilation ( IMV) is associated with the development of adverse pulmonary and non-pulmonary outcomes in very premature infants. Various modes of non-invasive respiratory support are increasingly being used to decrease the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The aim of this trial is to compare the effect of non-invasive high-frequency oscillatory ventilation ( NHFOV) and nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( NCPAP) in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( RDS) as a primary non-invasive ventilation support mode. In this multi-center randomized controlled trial , 300 preterm infants born at a gestational age of 26 In recent decades , several observational studies have compared the effects of NHFOV and NCPAP in neonates as a rescue mode or during weaning from IMV. To our knowledge , this will be the first multi-center prospective , randomized controlled trial to evaluate NHFOV as a primary mode in preterm infants with RDS in China or any other part of the world. Our trial may help to establish guidelines for NHFOV in preterm infants with RDS to minimize the need for IMV , and to decrease the significant pulmonary and non-pulmonary morbidities associated with IMV.
