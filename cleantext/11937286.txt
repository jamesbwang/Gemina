  The pathological or physiological<symptom> changes<symptom> of a crystalline lens directly affect the eye accommodation and transmittance , and then they increase the risk of presbyopia and cataracts for people in the middle and old age groups. There is no universally accepted quantitative method to measure the lens ' mechanical properties in vivo so far. This study aims to investigate the possibility of assessing the age-related stiffness change of crystalline lens by acoustic-radiation-force-based ultrasound elastography ( ARF-USE) in a rabbit model in vivo. There were 13 New Zealand white rabbits that were divided into four groups and fed normally until they were 60 ( n = 4) , 90 ( n = 2) , 120 ( n = 4) , and 150 ( n = 3) days old , respectively. An ARF-USE platform was built based on the Verasonics ™ Vantage 256 system. The shear waves were excited and traced in the lens by a linear ultrasound probe after a rabbit was anaesthetized. The average group velocities were 1.38 ± 0.2 m/s , 2.06 ± 0.3 m/s , 2.07 ± 0.29 m/s , and 2.30 ± 0.28 m/s , respectively , for the four groups of rabbits. The results shows that the group velocity has a strong correlation with the day age ( r = 0.84 , p < 1 × 10 This study demonstrated that the group velocity measured by ARF-USE had a strong correlation with age-related stiffness in a rabbit model , suggesting that group velocity is a good biomarker to characterize the stiffness of a crystalline lens. This study also demonstrated the feasibility of using this USE technique to assess the mechanical properties of the lens in vivo for clinical or research purposes.
