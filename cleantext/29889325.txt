  Chemotherapy suffers numbers of limitations including poor drug solubility , nonspecific biodistribution , and inevitable adverse effects on normal tissues. Tumor-targeted delivery and intratumoral stimuli-responsive release of drugs by nanomedicines are considered to be highly promising in solving these problems. Compared with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs , high concentration of nitric oxide ( NO) exhibits unique anticancer effects. The development of tumor-targeting and intratumoral microenvironment-responsive NO-releasing nanomedicines is highly desired. Here a novel kind of organic-inorganic composite nanomedicine ( QM-NPQ@PDHNs) is presented by encapsulating a glutathione S-transferases π ( GSTπ)- responsive drug O
