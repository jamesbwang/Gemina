  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fracture resistance and failure modes of onlay restorations prepared with different preparation designs. A total of 42 extracted , mandibular first molars ( 36 , 46) were used and divided into six groups according to preparation design , as follows 1A: Anatomic preparation of cusps/rounded shoulder margin/occlusal groove; 1B: Flat<symptom> preparation of cusps/rounded shoulder margin/occlusal groove; 2A: Anatomical preparation of cusps/occlusal groove; 2B: Flat<symptom> preparation of cusps/occlusal groove; 3A: Complete anatomical reduction of cusps/rounded shoulder margin; 3B: Complete flat reduction of cusps/rounded shoulder margin groups; intact tooth: No preparation. Onlays were constructed with 0.5-mm copings of Zirconia ceramic. The copings were veneered with porcelain ( IPS e. max Ceram). All samples were subjected to fracture resistance testing. Data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni-Dunn tests. Fracture resistance varied significantly according to preparation design. Among the anatomic occlusal preparation designs , fracture resistance was significantly lower in Group 3 when compared to Groups 1 and 2 ( P < 0.05). Among the flat occlusal preparation designs , fracture resistance was significantly higher in Group 1 when compared to Groups 2 and 3 ( P < 0.05). Preparation design affected the fracture resistance of onlay restorations. Cavities with flat occlusal preparation designs , a groove and shoulder margins ( 1B) resulted in the highest fracture resistance , whereas teeth prepared with a complete reduction of cusps and shoulder margins ( 3A) had the lowest fracture resistance.
