  Surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy is used in situ to determine the electrochemical stability of organic interfaces deposited onto the surface of nanostructured , thin-film gold electrodes via the electrochemical reduction of diazonium salts. These interfaces are shown to exhibit a wide electrochemical stability window in both acetonitrile and phosphate buffer , far surpassing the stability window of thiol-derived self-assembled monolayers. Using the same in situ technique , the application of radical scavengers during the electrochemical reduction of diazonium salts is shown to moderate interface formation. Consequently , the heterogeneous charge-transfer resistance can be reduced sufficiently to enhance the direct electron transfer between an immobilized redox-active enzyme and the electrode. This was demonstrated for the oxygen-tolerant ( NiFe) hydrogenase from the `` Knallgas '' bacterium<pathogen> Ralstonia<pathogen> eutropha by relating its electrochemical activity for hydrogen oxidation to the interface properties.
