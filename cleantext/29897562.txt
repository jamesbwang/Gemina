  In the current study we used contrast-enhanced T1 subtraction maps to test whether early changes in enhancing tumor volume are prognostic for overall survival ( OS) in newly diagnosed GBM patients treated with chemoradiation with or without bevacizumab ( BV). 798 patients ( 404 BV and 394 placebo) with newly diagnosed GBM in the AVAglio trial ( NCT00943826) had baseline MRI scans available , while 337 BV-treated and 269 placebo-treated patients had > 4 MRI scans for response evaluation. The volume of contrast enhancing tumor was quantified and used for subsequent analyses. A decrease in tumor volume during chemoradiation was associated with a longer OS in the placebo group ( HR = 1.578 , P < 0.0001) but not BV-treated group ( HR = 1.135 , P = 0.4889). Results showed a higher OS in patients on the placebo arm with a sustained decrease in tumor volume using a post-chemoradiation baseline ( HR = 1.692 , P = 0.0005) and a trend toward longer OS was seen in BV-treated patients ( HR = 1.264 , P = 0.0724). Multivariable Cox regression confirmed that sustained response or stable disease was prognostic for OS ( HR = 0.7509 , P = 0.0127) when accounting for age ( P = 0.0002) , KPS ( P = 0.1516) , post-surgical tumor volume ( P < 0.0001) , MGMT status ( P < 0.0001) , and treatment type ( P = 0.7637) using the post-chemoradiation baseline. The post-chemoradiation time point is a better baseline for evaluating efficacy in newly diagnosed GBM. Early progression during the maintenance phase is consequential in predicting OS , supporting the use of progression-free survival rates as a meaningful surrogate for GBM.
