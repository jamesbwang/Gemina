  The incorporation of a metal-carbon triple bond into a ring system is challenging because of the linear nature of triple bonds. To date , the synthesis of these complexes has been limited to those containing third-row transition metal centers , namely , osmium and rhenium. We report the synthesis and full characterization of the first cyclic metal carbyne complex with a second-row transition metal center , ruthenapentalyne. It shows a bond angle of 130.2 ( 3) ° around the sp-hybridized carbyne carbon , which represents the recorded smallest angle of second-row transition metal carbyne complexes , as it deviates nearly 50 ° from the original angle ( 180 °). Density functional theory calculations suggest that the inherent aromatic nature of these metallacycles with bent Ru ≡ C-C moieties enhances their stability. Reactivity studies showed striking observations , such as ambiphilic reactivity , a metal-carbon triple bond shift , and a ( 2 + 2) cycloaddition reaction with alkyne and cascade cyclization reactions with ambident nucleophiles.
