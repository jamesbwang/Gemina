  Because of age-related changes in sleep patterns , older adults may get less sleep than the recommended amount and experience decreased performance in daytime activities as a result. This article examines the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy addressing sleep. Thirteen Level I studies met inclusion criteria and were categorized into three themes: ( 1) one-to-one single-component interventions , ( 2) one-to-one multicomponent interventions , and ( 3) group multicomponent interventions. Strong evidence supports cognitive-behavioral intervention strategies for older adults that include relaxation , sleep hygiene education , problem solving , and physical exercise , among others , delivered one to one or in a group. Routine use of these interventions is recommended.
