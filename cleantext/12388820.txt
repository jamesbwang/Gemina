  Poxviruses encode a set of secreted proteins that bind cytokines and chemokines as a strategy to modulate host defense mechanisms. These viral proteins mimic the activity of host cytokine decoy receptors but have unique properties that may enhance their activity. Here , we describe the ability of poxvirus cytokine receptors to attach to the cell surface after secretion from infected cells , and we discuss the advantages that this property may confer to these viral immunomodulatory proteins.
