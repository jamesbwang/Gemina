  The periodic albino mutant of Xenopus laevis has been used to study the development of pigment cells because both the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE) and melanophores are affected. In this mutant , `` white pigment cells '' containing both melanophore-specific and iridophore-specific pigment organelles appear. The present experiments were designed to investigate the structural organization and expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor ( Mitf) in the mutant since Mitf is known to regulate the development of melanocytes and RPE. The exon structures of X. laevis mitf genes ( mitf.L and mitf.S) were defined using newly obtained Mitf transcripts and X. laevis genomic data. Compared to mouse mitf , exons 3 and 6a were absent in X. laevis mitf. The four exons between exons 4 and 6b in X. laevis mitf were named 5α , 5β , 5γ , and 5δ. Exons 5α and 5δ were specific to X. laevis mitf , whereas the continuous exons 5β/γ were identical to exon 5 of mouse mitf. A wide variety of A-Mitf and M-Mitf transcript variants lacking one or more exons were found in X. laevis; however , different types of Mitf transcripts were expressed in the mutant. In addition , white pigment cells and melanophores expressed both the mitf and dopachrome tautomerase ( dct) genes.
