  Sirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR) inhibitor. Metformin may potentiate mTOR inhibition by sirolimus while mitigating its adverse effects. We conducted a pilot study to test this hypothesis. Patients with advanced solid tumor were treated with sirolimus for 7 days followed by randomization to either sirolimus with metformin ( Arm A) or sirolimus ( Arm B) until day 21. From day 22 onwards , all patients received sirolimus and metformin. The primary aim was to compare the change in phospho-p70S6K ( pp70S6K) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC) from day 8 to day 22 using a two-sample t test. Secondary aims were objective response rate , toxicity , and other serum pharmacodynamic biomarkers ( e.g. , fasting glucose , triglycerides , insulin , C-peptide , IGF-1 , IGF-1R , IGF-BP , and leptin). 24 patients were enrolled , with 18 evaluable for the primary endpoint. There was no significant difference in mean change in pp70S6K in arm A vs. arm B (- 0.12 vs.- 0.16; P = 0.64). Similarly , there were no significant differences in other serum pharmacodynamic biomarkers. There were no partial responses. There were no dose-limiting or unexpected toxicities. Adding metformin to sirolimus , although well tolerated , was not associated with significant changes in pp70S6K in PBMC or other serum pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Combining metformin with sirolimus did not improve mTOR inhibition.
