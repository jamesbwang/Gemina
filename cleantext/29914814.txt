  We previously reported 3-month and 12-month occlusion rates after treatment of clinically symptomatic saphenous vein reflux with either cyanoacrylate closure ( CAC) using the VenaSeal Closure System ( Medtronic , Dublin , Ireland) or radiofrequency ablation ( RFA) in a randomized , multicenter , clinical trial , VenaSeal Sapheon Closure System vs Radiofrequency Ablation for Incompetent Great Saphenous Veins ( VeClose). Herein we report the 24-month follow-up results of the VeClose trial. There were 222 patients with symptomatic great saphenous vein ( GSV) incompetence who were randomly assigned to receive either CAC ( n = 108) or RFA ( n = 114). Patients were not allowed to receive adjunctive treatment of tributary varicosities until after the 3-month visit. Duplex ultrasound of the target vein was performed at day 3 and months 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , and 24 after treatment , and closure was assessed by ultrasound by the treating physician. Overall 24-month success rates were compared; in addition , time to first reopening of the target vein was evaluated using survival analysis. End points such as Venous Clinical Severity Score , EuroQoL-5 Dimension , and Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire were evaluated. Of 222 randomized patients , 171 completed the 24-month follow-up , which included 87 from the CAC group and 84 from the RFA group. The 24-month complete closure rate was 95.3 % in the CAC group and 94.0 % in the RFA group , demonstrating continued noninferiority of CAC compared with RFA ( P = .0034). Symptoms and quality of life improved similarly in both groups. No clinically significant device- or procedure-related late adverse events occurred. Both CAC and RFA were effective in closure of the target GSV , resulting in similar and significant improvements in the patient 's quality of life through 24 months. These results suggest that CAC of the GSV is safe and durable out to 2 years.
