  Myxomatous cerebral aneurysms<disease> are rare sequelae of cardiac atrial myxoma. These aneurysms<disease> are generally fusiform , multiple , and distal. Pathogenesis and evolution of these aneurysms<disease> is still debated. There are currently no guidelines on the management of aneurysms<disease> secondary to atrial myxoma. We present a case of a 52-year-old man with multiple fusiform aneurysms<disease> 3 years after resection of a left atrial myxoma. One of these aneurysms<disease> was followed with cerebral angiography and showed substantial interval enlargement. This aneurysm<disease> was subsequently embolized. All aneurysms<disease> were stable 6 months post-embolization.
