  Women suffering from infertility<symptom> are at higher risk of experiencing psychological problems. Sexual function and sexual related quality of life is not considered as it should be. We designed this study to assess depression<symptom> , sexual function and sexual quality of life in Iranian women with infertility<symptom>. Two hundred and sixty four individuals participated in the study ( 115 healthy controls , 78 with primary and 71 with secondary infertility<symptom>). All participants were asked to fill a valid and reliable Persian versions of BDI ( Beck depression<symptom> inventory) , FSFIS ( Female Sexual Function Index) and sexual quality of life-Female ( SQOL-F) questionnaires. Mean BDI score was significantly lower in healthy individuals.Individuals with primary infertility<symptom> suffered more from sexual dysfunction , while BDI score was significantly higher and SQOL-F was significantly lower in cases with sexual dysfunction. There was significant positive correlation between SQOL-F and total FSFI score ( r = 0.59 , p < 0.001). Linear regression analysis by considering SQOL-F as dependent and age , BDI , duration of marriage , sexual dysfunction ( FSFI â‰¤ 26.55 or > 26.55) showed that BDI and sexual dysfunction were independent predictors of SQOL-F. Sexual function and quality of life related to sexual life should be considered in Iranian infertile ones. Depression<symptom> as a crucial factor should be focused more in infertile women.
