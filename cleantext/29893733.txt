  In this study , an anaerobic baffled reactor ( ABR) with four compartments was employed to treat alkali-decrement wastewater of polyester fabrics under different organic loading rates. The stable operation of this reactor was achieved in 70 days at a hydraulic retention time of 36 h and mesophilic temperature of 35 ± 1 °C. It is found that the chemical oxygen demand removal and decolorization of this system can be as high as 79.0 % and 87.7 % , respectively. The different acidogenesis and methanogenesis in four compartments was acclimated by the variation of pH , oxidation reduction potential values and operational conditions in the spatial distribution of the first to fourth compartments of the ABR system. In addition , the dehydrogenase activity ( DHA) and coenzyme F
