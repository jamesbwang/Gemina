  Graphene is one of the most promising spintronic materials due to its high carrier mobility. However , the absence of a band gap and ferromagnetic order in graphene seriously limit its applications in spintronics. How to utilize its high carrier mobility as well as mediate its electronic structure remains a challenge. Herein , we design a novel composite , which is composed of graphene and Mn-doped monolayer MoS
