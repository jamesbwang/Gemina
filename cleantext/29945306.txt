  The increase in the prevalence of drug-resistant Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> is a serious public health concern , which is closely linked to the formation of biofilm. It is reported that the bacteriophage and its endolysin have a good ability to degrade biofilms. The goals of this study were to compare the ability of A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> bacteriophage AB3 , its endolysin AB3 , and three antibiotics to degrade A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> biofilm and biofilm-bound A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> and to understand the antibacterial mechanism of LysAB3. The 558-bp sequence of the LysAB3 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR); the fragment was cloned into pET28a ( +) to construct the recombinant plasmid pET28a-LysAB3 , which was then expressed in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> BL21 ( DE3) to obtain the LysAB3. Differences in A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> biofilm and biofilm-bound A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> after treatment with bacteriophage AB3 , LysAB3 or three antibiotics were examined using the crystal violet staining method and an MTT ( 3- ( 4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Changes in biofilm morphology and thickness in each treatment group were observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. In addition , a LysAB3 construct with the amphiphilic peptide structural region removed ( LysAB3-D) was assessed for its antibacterial activity. After 24-hour treatment with either bacteriophage AB3 and its LysAB3 , A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> biofilms were significantly degraded , and the number of viable biofilm-bound A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> were also significantly decreased. After removing the amphiphilic peptide structure motif from LysAB3 , the antibacterial activity decreased from 95.8 % to 33.3 %. Thus , LysAB3 can effectively degrade A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> biofilm and biofilm-bound A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> in vitro. The antibacterial mechanism of LysAB3 may be associated with the ability of the amphiphilic peptide structural region to enhance the permeability of cytoplasmic membrane of A.<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> by degradation of bacterial wall peptidoglycan.
