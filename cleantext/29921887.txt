  Tumor-targeted drug delivery systems ( Tt-DDSs) are proposed as a promising strategy for cancer care. However , the dense collagen network in tumors stroma significantly reduces the penetration and efficacy of Tt-DDS. In order to investigate the effect of asiatic acid ( AA) on antitumor effect of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD) by attenuating stroma-collagen , colon cancer xenograft mice ( SW620 cell line) were treated by PLD , AA , or combined regimes , respectively; the collagen levels were estimated by Sirius red/fast green dual staining and immunohistochemistry ( IHC) staining; the intratumor exposure of doxorubicin was visualized by ex vivo fluorescence imaging and quantified by HPLC/MS analysis. In addition , the impact of AA on collagen synthesis of fibroblast cell ( HFL-1) and cytotoxic effect of PLD and doxorubicin to cancer cell ( SW620) were studied in vitro. In the presence of AA ( 4 mg/kg) , the intratumor collagen level was restricted in vivo ( reduced by 22 % , from 4.14 % ± 0.30 % to 3.24 % ± 0.25 % , P = 0.051) and in vitro. Subsequently , doxorubicin level was increased by ~ 30 %. The antitumor activity of PLD was significantly improved ( 57.3 % inhibition of tumor growth and 44 % reduction in tumor weight) by AA combination. Additionally , no significant improvement in cytotoxic effect of PLD or doxorubicin induced by AA was observed. In conclusion , AA is a promising sensitizer for tumor treatment by enhancing intratumor drug exposure via stromal remodeling.
