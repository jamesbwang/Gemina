  Critical-sized bone defects are incapable of self-healing and are commonly seen in clinical practice. The authors explore a new treatment for this , decellularized periosteum is applied to chitosan globules ( chitosan-DP globules) as a hybrid material. The efficacy of chitosan-DP globules on rabbit femoral condyle bone defects is assessed with biocompatibility , biomechanics , and osteogenic efficiency measurements , and compared with the results of chitosan globules and empty control. No difference in cytotoxicity is observed among chitosan-DP globules , chitosan globules , and the empty control. Chitosan-DP globules possesse a better surface for cell adhesion than did chitosan globules. Chitosan-DP globules demonstrate superior efficiency for osteogenesis in the defect area compared to chitosan globules as per microcomputed tomography examination and push-out testing , with relatively minor histological differences. Both chitosan globule groups show more satisfactory results than those for the empty control. The results implicate chitosan-DP globules as a promising solution for bone defects.
