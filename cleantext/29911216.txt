  Crosslinked PVDF-membranes are demonstrated to offer a viable alternative for centrifugation in the preparation of MOF-particles , thus realising new opportunities at lab-scale and continuous production at large-scale. The membranes<symptom> combine extreme-pH with solvent stability , thus enabling application in any MOF synthesis , demonstrated here for ZIF-8 , ZIF-67 , HKUST-1 , UiO-66 and MIL-53 ( Al).
