  Verbal descriptors are an important pain assessment parameter. The purpose of this study was to explore the ability to discriminate deep muscle<symptom> pain<symptom> and overlying fascia pain according to verbal descriptors and compare the pattern with skin stimulation ( from previously published data). In 16 healthy human subjects , electrical stimulation was chosen to excite a broad spectrum of nociceptive primary afferents innervating the respective tissues. The 24-item Pain Perception Scale ( Schmerzempfindungsskala ( SES)) was used to determine the induced pain quality. Overall , affective ( The differences in sensory descriptor patterns between muscle and fascia may potentially guide treatment towards muscle or fascia in low<symptom> back<symptom> pain<symptom> physiotherapeutic regimes. The similarity of descriptor patterns between fascia and skin , both including the terms `` burning '' and `` stinging , '' opens the possibility that neuropathic back pain ( when the dorsal ramus of the spinal nerve is affected) may be confused with low back pain of fascia origin.
