  Given growing initiatives incentivizing academic researchers to engage in ` entrepreneurial ' activities , this article examines how these academic entrepreneurs claim value in their entrepreneurial engagements , and navigate concerns related to conflicts of interest. Using data from qualitative interviews with twenty-four academic entrepreneurs in Canada , we show how these scientists value entrepreneurial activities for providing financial and intellectual resources to academic science , as well as for their potential to create impact through translation. Simultaneously , these scientists claimed to maintain academic norms of disinterested science and avoid conflicts of interest. Using theories of institutional work , we demonstrate how entrepreneurial scientists engage in processes of institutional change-through-maintenance , drawing on the maintenance of academic norms as institutional resources to legitimize entrepreneurial activities. As entrepreneurial scientists work to legitimize new zones of academic scientific practice , there is a need to carefully regulate and scrutinize these activities so that their potential harms do not become obscured.
