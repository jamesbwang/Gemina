  In Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol fermentation , bacteria should tolerate high concentrations of solvent products , which inhibit bacteria growth and limit further increase of solvents to more than 20 g/L. Moreover , this limited solvent concentration significantly increases the cost of solvent separation through traditional approaches. In this study , alginate adsorbent immobilization technique was successfully developed to assist
