  To establish a height prediction model of Chinese Han male based on the reported 547 height-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms （ SNPs ） loci in Europeans , and assess its accuracy for height estimation. The DNA typing was analyzed in 59 Han male samples of Shandong province by Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 chip and HiSeq 4000 sequencing platform. Prediction model was established using 547 height-associated SNPs loci as predictors and weight allele sums （ WAS ） as computing method. The accuracy of height prediction model was analysed using receiver operating characteristic （ ROC ） curve and area under curve （ AUC ）. There was no height-associated SNPs locus was found by genome-wide association studies. In present study , height prediction model was established by WAS and obtained an AUC of 0.67 （ 95 % CI: 0.53-0.90 ）. It has reference value for predicting the height of Han male in Shandong province by WAS model based on 547 SNPs loci , while it is still necessary to further promote the accuracy of the prediction model by screening more height-associated SNPs loci with population heterogeneity.
