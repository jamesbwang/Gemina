  In general , colloids provide increased cutaneous permeation of drugs. Still , skin interaction and main pathways for drug diffusion may vary depending on system and formulation characteristics. The knowledge of how different colloidal systems interact with biological membranes<symptom> and the formulation impact on delivery is especially relevant for drugs that can be encapsulated in multiple nanosystems , as voriconazole ( VOR). In here , we compared VOR release and permeation profile from liposomes ( LP) and nanostructured lipid carriers ( NLC) in aqueous colloidal dispersions and in gel formulations. Despite the controlled drug release provided by gel formulations , formulation only had a significant impact on drug skin accumulation from LP. The reduced mobility in gel formulations compromised follicle deposition and drug retention in the skin. Such a hypothesis was confirmed by permeation experiments evaluating follicle pathway influence. Follicular route also had an influence on delivery from NLC , which was only significant for total drug that reached the acceptor medium. These differences could be attributed to the mechanisms of colloid interaction with the skin and subsequent drug release. Follicle LP deposition and slow drug release leads to higher cutaneous amounts whilst NLC interaction with skin and fast drug release leads to fast drug diffusion and deeper penetration.
