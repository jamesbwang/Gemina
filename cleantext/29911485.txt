  There is a particular need for valid scales to screen for posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) among women who seek safe shelter from intimate partner violence. Screening to identify women who are at risk for PTSD can lead to early intervention that reduces the risk for PTSD-related outcomes such as poor decision making , inconsistent parenting , and behavior dysfunction<symptom> among their children. The gold standard for diagnosing PTSD is the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( 5th ed.; DSM-5) ( CAPS-5). A seven-item PTSD screen has been used for in this population and has a well-established cutoff score but has not been validated against the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD. The study purpose was to establish concurrent validity for a seven-item screen for PTSD with the CAPS-5. Participants were 75 women , 18 years or older , who were residents of a 120-bed shelter in the southern United States. They spoke English or Spanish. They reported intimate partner physical or sexual violence within 4 months of their entry into the study. Following informed consent , data were collected in individual interviews , conducted in either English or Spanish. In addition to demographic data , the seven-item PTSD screen and the CAPS-5 were administered. A receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis was conducted to assess the concurrent validity of the seven-item PTSD screen with the CAPS-5. The seven-item PTSD screen results were significantly correlated with the CAPS-5 results in this sample ( area under the curve ( AUC) = .640 , z = 2.670 , p = .008). Sensitivity was 96.2 , and observed specificity was 31.8. The seven-item PTSD screen demonstrates excellent sensitivity ( e.g. , 96 % of true PTSD cases) and acceptable specificity ( 32 % of non-PTSD cases) and can be used to quickly and accurately identify individuals for diagnostic assessment and intervention.
