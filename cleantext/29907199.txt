  Surgical residents increasingly seek global surgery ( GS) experiences during training. Understanding their motives and goals is important to develop the optimal educational programs. A survey for surgical residents was developed to explore this interest. A survey administered in 2016 to residents in three surgical programs within the same academic institution assessed interest , prior global health experience , preferred training opportunities , and career goals in GS. Seventy-four surgical residents responded ( 78 %) with 82 % expressing interest in GS and 86 % motivated by a desire for volunteerism. International electives ( 65 %) and volunteer missions ( 49 %) were the preferred experiences during residency over longer commitments such as advanced degrees. A majority of residents planned to incorporate GS into their career ( 76 %) most commonly by volunteering on missions ( 70 %) with a smaller group aiming for a career in GS ( 13 %). Residents with prior global health experience ( n = 27 , 36 %) showed greater interest in GS ( 96 % versus 72 % , P = 0.02) and a commitment after residency ( 93 % versus 68 % , P = 0.02) , and trended toward greater interest in GS careers ( 22 % versus 6 % , P = 0.06). Institutional interest in GS remains high among surgical residents , motivated primarily by a desire for volunteerism. Following training , most residents plan to participate in short-term volunteer commitments , though a small group envisions GS as part of their long-term career goals. Prior global health experience is associated with interest in GS both in the present and long term. Providing these experiences early may be a strategy to support academic interest.
