  A Stille cross-coupling reaction was developed that delivers for the first time trifluoromethyl-substituted homoallyl compounds from α- ( trifluoromethyl) benzyl chlorides and allylstannanes. This reaction proceeds even with low catalyst loadings ( 1 mol %) via a rare CF3-Pd-π-benzyl intermediate.
