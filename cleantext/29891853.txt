  Minimally invasive methods have been described to detect Barrett 's esophagus ( BE) , but are limited by subjectivity and suboptimal accuracy. We identified methylated DNA markers ( MDMs) for BE in tissue and assessed their accuracy on whole esophagus brushings and capsule sponge samples. Step 1: Unbiased whole methylome sequencing was performed on DNA from BE and normal squamous esophagus ( SE) tissue. Discriminant MDM candidates were validated on an independent patient cohort ( 62 BE cases , 30 controls) by quantitative methylation specific PCR ( qMSP). Step 2: Selected MDMs were further evaluated on whole esophageal brushings ( 49 BE cases , 36 controls). 35 previously sequenced esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC) MDMs were also evaluated. Step 3: 20 BE cases and 20 controls were randomized to swallow capsules sponges ( 25 mm , 10 pores or 20 pores per inch ( ppi)) followed endoscopy. DNA yield , tolerability , and mucosal injury were compared. Best MDM assays were performed on this cohort. Step 1: 19 MDMs with areas under the ROC curve ( AUCs) > 0.85 were carried forward. Step 2: On whole esophageal brushings , 80 % of individual MDM candidates showed high accuracy for BE ( AUCs 0.84-0.94). Step 3: The capsule sponge was swallowed and withdrawn in 98 % of subjects. Tolerability was superior with the 10 ppi sponge with minimal mucosal injury and abundant DNA yield. A 2-marker panel ( VAV3 + ZNF682) yielded excellent BE discrimination ( AUC = 1). Identified MDMs discriminate BE with high accuracy. BE detection appears safe and feasible with a capsule sponge. Corroboration in larger studies is warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02560623.
