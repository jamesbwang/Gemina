  Protein degradation in all domains of life requires ATPases that unfold and inject proteins into compartmentalized proteolytic chambers. Proteasomal ATPases in eukaryotes and archaea contain poorly understood N-terminally conserved coiled-coil domains. In this study , we engineer disulfide crosslinks in the coiled-coils of the archaeal proteasomal ATPase ( PAN) and report that its three identical coiled-coil domains can adopt three different conformations: ( 1) in-register and zipped , ( 2) in-register and partially unzipped , and ( 3) out-of-register. This conformational heterogeneity conflicts with PAN 's symmetrical OB-coiled-coil crystal structure but resembles the conformational heterogeneity of the 26S proteasomal ATPases ' coiled-coils. Furthermore , we find that one coiled-coil can be conformationally constrained even while unfolding substrates , and conformational changes in two of the coiled-coils regulate PAN switching between resting and active states. This switching functionally mimics similar states proposed for the 26S proteasome from cryo-EM. These findings thus build a mechanistic framework to understand regulation of proteasome activity.
