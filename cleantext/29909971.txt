  Mutations in PLA2G6 ( PARK14) cause neurodegenerative disorders in humans , including autosomal recessive neuroaxonal dystrophy and early-onset parkinsonism. We show that loss of iPLA2-VIA , the fly homolog of PLA2G6 , reduces lifespan , impairs synaptic transmission , and causes neurodegeneration. Phospholipases typically hydrolyze glycerol phospholipids , but loss of iPLA2-VIA does not affect the phospholipid composition of brain tissue but rather causes an elevation in ceramides. Reducing ceramides with drugs , including myriocin or desipramine , alleviates lysosomal stress and suppresses neurodegeneration. iPLA2-VIA binds the retromer subunits Vps35 and Vps26 and enhances retromer function to promote protein and lipid recycling. Loss of iPLA2-VIA impairs retromer function , leading to a progressive increase in ceramide. This induces a positive feedback loop that affects membrane fluidity and impairs retromer function and neuronal function. Similar defects are observed upon loss of vps26 or vps35 or overexpression of Î±-synuclein , indicating that these defects may be common in Parkinson disease.
