  We overexpressed and purified 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas<pathogen> sp.. B-0831 ( Ps3αHSD) and its mutants where the active site residues known as the SYK triad , Ser114 , Tyr153 , and Lys157 , were mutated. Ps3αHSD catalyzes the reaction by using a nucleotide cofactor. The NADH binding affinity of K157A mutant was much lower than that of the wild-type , mainly due to loss of a hydrogen bond. The decreased affinity would result in decreased k
