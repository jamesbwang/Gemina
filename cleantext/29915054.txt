  The interlayer coupling can be used to engineer the electronic structure of van der Waals heterostructures ( superlattices) to obtain properties that are not possible in a single material. So far research in heterostructures has been focused on commensurate superlattices with a long-ranged Moiré period. Incommensurate heterostructures with rotational symmetry but not translational symmetry ( in analogy to quasicrystals) are not only rare in nature , but also the interlayer interaction has often been assumed to be negligible due to the lack of phase coherence. Here we report the successful growth of quasicrystalline 30 ° twisted bilayer graphene ( 30 °- tBLG) , which is stabilized by the Pt ( 111) substrate , and reveal its electronic structure. The 30 °- tBLG is confirmed by low energy electron diffraction and the intervalley double-resonance Raman mode at 1383 cm
