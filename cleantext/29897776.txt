  The N-heterocyclic carbene ( NHC)- catalyzed trifluoromethylation of α-chloro aldehydes was developed , allowing straightforward access to valuable α-trifluoromethyl ester derivatives. The unique combination of an electrophilic trifluoromethylation reagent with NHC catalysis was the key for the functionalization of a broad range of α-chloro aldehydes , and the products are formed in moderate to good yields. Investigations of the enantioselective version of this reaction afforded the enantioenriched products in moderate yields with good ee values.
