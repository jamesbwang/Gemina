  A correction approach for the inclined array of hydrophones is proposed to prevent decline of the image quality in SAS. In this approach , the 2-way exact acoustic propagation path of the inclined array is transformed into the sum of a single root term and an offset term , where the single root term is the 2-way ideal propagation path and the offset term contains all errors cause by the inclined array. The correction for the offset term is separated into two steps: phase correction and delay correction. The phase correction is performed on the echo signal of each receiving hydrophone in the 2-D time domain by a phase multiplication and the delay correction is performed on the echo signal of each receiving hydrophone in the range frequency domain by a phase multiplication with a linear function of range frequency at the reference range. Finally , the effectiveness of the proposed approach is examined by the simulation experiments.
