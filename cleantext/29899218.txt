  The overuse of cartap in tea tree leads to hazardous residues threatening human health. A colorimetric determination was established to detect cartap residues in tea beverages by silver nanoparticles ( AgNP) sensor with magnetic molecularly imprinted polymeric microspheres ( Fe ₃ O ₄ @mSiO ₂ @MIPs) as recognition elements. Using Fe ₃ O ₄ as supporting core , mesoporous SiO ₂ as intermediate shell , methylacrylic acid as functional monomer , and cartap as template , Fe ₃ O ₄ @mSiO ₂ @MIPs were prepared to selectively and magnetically separate cartap from tea solution before colorimetric determination by AgNP sensors. The core-shell Fe ₃ O ₄ @mSiO ₂ @MIPs were also characterized by FT-IR , TEM , VSM , and experimental adsorption. The Fe ₃ O ₄ @mSiO ₂ @MIPs could be rapidly separated by an external magnet in 10 s with good reusability ( maintained 95.2 % through 10 cycles). The adsorption process of cartap on Fe ₃ O ₄ @mSiO ₂ @MIPs conformed to Langmuir adsorption isotherm with maximum adsorption capacity at 0.257 mmol/g and short equilibrium time of 30 min at 298 K. The AgNP colorimetric method semi-quantified cartap & ge; 5 mg/L by naked eye and quantified cartap 0.1 ⁻ 5 mg/L with LOD 0.01 mg/L by UV-vis spectroscopy. The AgNP colorimetric detection after pretreatment with Fe ₃ O ₄ @mSiO ₂ @MIPs could be successfully utilized to recognize and detect cartap residues in tea beverages.
