  Social robots may promote the health of older adults by increasing their perceived emotional support and social interaction. This review aims to summarize the effectiveness of social robots on outcomes ( psychological , physiological , quality of life , or medications) of older adults from randomized controlled trials ( RCTs). A mixed-method systematic review of RCTs meeting the study inclusion criteria was undertaken. Eight databases were electronically searched up to September 2017. Participants ' characteristics , intervention features , and outcome data were retrieved. The mean difference and standardized mean difference with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) were synthesized to pool the effect size. A total of 13 articles from 11 RCTs were identified from 2,204 articles , of which 9 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Risk of bias was relatively high in allocation concealment and blinding. Social robots appeared to have positive impacts on agitation , anxiety<symptom> , and quality of life for older adults but no statistical significance was found in the meta-analysis. However , results from a narrative review indicated that social robot interactions could improve engagement , interaction , and stress indicators , as well as reduce loneliness and the use of medications for older adults. Social robots appear to have the potential to improve the well-being of older adults , but conclusions are limited due to the lack of high-quality studies. More RCTs are recommended with larger sample sizes and rigorous study designs.
