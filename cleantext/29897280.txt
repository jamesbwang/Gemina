  Familial hyperkalemic hypertension is caused by mutations in WNK kinases , or in proteins that mediate their degradation , KLHL3 and cullin 3 ( Cul3). While the mechanisms by which WNK and KLHL3 mutations cause the disease are now clear , the effects of the disease-causing Cul3Δ403-459 mutation remain controversial. Possible mechanisms including hyperneddylation , altered ubiquitin ligase activity , decreased association with the COP9 signalosome ( CSN) , and increased association with and degradation of KLHL3 have all been postulated. Here , we systematically evaluated the effects of Cul3Δ403-459 using cultured kidney cells. We first identified that the catalytically active CSN subunit JAB1 does not associate with the deleted Cul3 4HB domain , but instead with the adjacent α/β1 domain , suggesting that altered protein folding underlie the impaired binding. Inhibition of deneddylation , with JAB1 siRNA , increased Cul3 neddylation , and decreased KLHL3 abundance , similar to the Cul3 mutant. We next determined that KLHL3 degradation has both ubiquitin ligase-dependent and- independent components. Proteasomal KLHL3 degradation was enhanced by Cul3Δ403-459; however , autophagic degradation was also upregulated by this Cul3 mutant. Finally , to evaluate whether deficient substrate adaptor was responsible for the disease , we restored KLHL3 to WT-Cul3 levels. In the absence of WT-Cul3 , WNK4 was not degraded , demonstrating that Cul3Δ403-459 itself can not degrade WNK4; conversely , when WT-Cul3 was present , as in diseased humans , WNK4 degradation was restored. In conclusion , deletion of exon 9 from Cul3 generates a protein that is itself ubiquitin ligase-defective , but also capable of enhanced autophagocytic KLHL3 degradation , thereby exerting dominant-negative effects on the WT-allele.
