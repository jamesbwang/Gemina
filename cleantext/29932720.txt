  The superradiant instability can lead to the generation of extremely dense axion clouds around rotating black holes. We show that , despite the long lifetime of the QCD axion with respect to spontaneous decay into photon pairs , stimulated decay becomes significant above a minimum axion density and leads to extremely bright lasers. The lasing threshold can be attained for axion masses μ ≳ 10 ^ ( -8) eV , which implies superradiant instabilities around spinning primordial black holes with mass ≲ 0.01 M _ ( ⊙). Although the latter are expected to be nonrotating at formation , a population of spinning black holes may result from subsequent mergers. We further show that lasing can be quenched by Schwinger pair production , which produces a critical electron-positron plasma within the axion cloud. Lasing can nevertheless restart once annihilation lowers the plasma density sufficiently , resulting in multiple laser bursts that repeat until the black hole spins down sufficiently to quench the superradiant instability. In particular , axions with a mass ∼ 10 ^ ( -5) eV and primordial black holes with mass ∼ 10 ^ ( 24) kg , which may account for all the dark matter in the Universe , lead to millisecond bursts in the GHz radio-frequency range , with peak luminosities ∼ 10 ^ ( 42) erg/s , suggesting a possible link to the observed fast radio bursts.
