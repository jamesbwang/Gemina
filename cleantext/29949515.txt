  To compare growth and body composition of preterm infants ( gestational age < 32 weeks) with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD). A prospective cohort involving three neonatal units in the public health system of the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. Inclusion: newborns with gestational age < 32 weeks. BPD. Anthropometric measurements were performed at birth and at 1 month of infant corrected age. Body composition was measured using an air displacement plethysmography ( ADP) ( PEA POD Â®) at 1 month of infant corrected age. Ninety-five newborns were eligible , of which 67 were included , 32.8 % of them with BPD. Newborns with BPD presented lower gestational age at birth , greater need for resuscitation in the delivery room , received parenteral nutrition ( PN) for a longer period of time , achieved lower weights during hospital stay and required more time to reach a full enteral diet. No statistically significant differences were observed in relation to anthropometric measurements and body composition at 1 month of infant corrected age between the groups with and without BPD. This study , unlike previous ones , has shown that children who developed BPD were able to regain growth , as measured by anthropometric measures , with no change in body composition at 1 month of infant corrected age.
