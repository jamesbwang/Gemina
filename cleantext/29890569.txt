  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases in recent years. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin with and without a synbiotic supplement in the treatment of patients with NAFLD. In total , 138 NAFLD patients aged 18-60 years were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized to one of the following treatments for 16 weeks: Group I ( n = 68) , sitagliptin 50 mg daily plus placebo ( one capsule per day) or group II ( n = 70) sitagliptin 50 mg daily plus synbiotic ( one capsule per day). Changes in fasting blood glucose ( FBS) , liver enzymes , lipid profile , and body mass index were compared between the groups. The mean change in FBS with sitagliptin-placebo from baseline was -10.47 ± 5.77 mg/dL , and that with sitagliptin-synbiotic was -13.52 ± 4.16 mg/dL. There was a significant difference between the groups ( P < 0.001). The mean change in cholesterol ( Chol) was -8.34 ± 28.83 mg/dL with sitagliptin-placebo and -21.25 ± 15.50 mg/dL with sitagliptinsynbiotic. There was a significant difference between the two groups ( P = 0.029). The administration of sitagliptin-placebo induced an increase of 6.13 ± 27.04 mg/dL in low density lipoprotein ( LDL) , whereas sitagliptin-synbiotic induced a decrease of 14.92 ± 15.85 mg/dL in LDL. A significant difference was observed between the two groups ( P < 0.001). On the other hand , in the sitagliptin-synbiotic group , there was significant improvement in aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) level compared to the sitagliptin-placebo group ( P = 0.018). Sitagliptin-synbiotic produced greater improvement in FBS , AST , Chol , and LDL compared to sitagliptin alone in patients with NAFLD.
