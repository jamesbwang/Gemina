  Although a host of evidence-based treatments exist for youth with anxiety<symptom> disorders , less than 30 % of youth and their families receive these treatments. One of the main barriers to receiving these treatments is the lack of access to care , due largely to the absence of mental health professionals who have expertise in the delivery of these treatments in certain geographic locales. The current study examined whether a brief intensive treatment for specific phobias ( SPs) , Augmented One-Session Treatment ( OST-A) , would result in comparable treatment gains for families who traveled a considerable distance to receive this treatment when compared to families who resided in our local community. Participants included 76 youth with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of SP ( 38 local families and an age- and sex-matched sample of 38 nonlocal families). Although SP severity at pretreatment was significantly greater for the nonlocal youth than the local youth , both nonlocal and local youth showed commensurate improvement and maintenance of treatment gains over a 6-month period across several clinical outcome measures. Findings from this study show that OST-A is effective when families choose to travel for treatment , addressing at least one of the barriers to use of this evidence-based treatment.
