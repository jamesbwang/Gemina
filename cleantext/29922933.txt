  ( 1) to estimate the prevalence of Circle of Willis ( CoW) variants in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy , ( 2) to correlate these variants to controls and ( 3) cerebral ischemia depicted by computed tomography ( CT). After Institutional Review Board approval , data of 544 carotid endarterectomy patients ( 331 males , mean age 69 ± 8 years) and 196 controls ( 117 males , mean age 66 ± 11 years) who underwent brain CT and carotid CT angiography ( CTA) were retrospectively analysed. Two observers independently classified each CoW segment as normal , hypoplastic ( diameter < 0.8 mm) or non-visualized. Four groups of CoW variants based on the number of hypoplastic/non-visualized segments were correlated with clinical data ( ANOVA , χ High prevalence of CoW variants ( 97 %) and compromised CoW ( 81 %) was observed in the study group and significant difference was found in the distribution of CoW variants compared to controls ( p < 0.001) , internal carotid artery ( ICA) stenosis being the only independent predictor of CoW morphology ( p < 0.001). Significant correlation was found between CoW configuration and brain ischemia in the study group ( p = 0.002). ICA stenosis of ≥ 90 % was associated to higher rate of ipsilateral A1 hypoplasia/non-visualization ( p < 0.001). Intra- and inter-observer agreement was from substantial to almost perfect ( Cohen κ = 0.75-1.0). Highly variable CoW morphology was demonstrated in patients undergoing endarterectomy compared to controls. Likely compromised CoW in relation to cerebral ischemia was observed in a large cohort of carotid endarterectomy subjects. • CoW variant distribution significantly differed in the study and control groups ( p < 0.001). • ICA stenosis was the only independent predictor of CoW morphology ( p < 0.001). • Severely compromised CoW configuration showed significant association with brain ischemia ( p = 0.002).
