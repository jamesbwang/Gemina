  The aim of this study was to develop a new drug substance with low toxicity and effective inhibitory activity against cisplatin-resistant oral cancer. The naturally produced pterostilbene was selected as the lead compound for design and synthesis of a series of bis ( hydroxymethyl) propionate-based prodrugs. All derivatives were screened for antiproliferative effects against the cisplatin-resistant oral squamous ( CAR) cell line and the results indicated that several compounds demonstrated superior inhibitory activity compared with pterostilbene and resveratrol. Among them , the most promising compound , 12 , was evaluated for in vivo antitumor activity in a CAR xenograft nude mouse model. Obvious antitumor activity was observed at the lowest oral dose ( 25 mg/kg/day). Increasing the dose of 12 to 100 mg/kg/day reduced the tumor size to 22 % of the control group. Based on these findings as well as the extremely low toxicity seen in the in vivo studies , we believe that compound 12 could serve as a new lead for further development.
