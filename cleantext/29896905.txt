  Considering to the possibility of cellular and genetic damage by the implant materials in the patient and the clinician , the safety of the biomaterials should be evaluated. The purpose of this study was to compare the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity induced by two nanocomposites , hydroxyapatite/bioactive glass ( HA/BG) and fluorapatite/bioactive glass ( FA/BG) in vitro. Biomaterial extracts ( BMEX , 100 %) were prepared by incubating 100 mg/mL of each biomaterial powder in complete culture medium ( RPMI1640 + 10 % FBS) for 72 hours. Saos-II cells were exposed to different concentrations of BMEXs for different periods of time and evaluated at the end of each period. According to MTT assay results , both BMEXs at low concentrations ( < 25 %) has no inhibitory effects on the cells growth. After 24 hours of exposure , only HA/BG BMEX at 100 % concentration showed significant cytotoxic effect. After 48 and 72 hours , both HA/BG and FA/BG BMEXs showed similar cytotoxic effect at concentration higher than 75 % and 50 % , respectively. The results of the comet assay showed that the tail elongation , and proportionally DNA damage , increased in a dose/time dependently fashion with BMEXs exposure. Based on low and similar cytotoxicity and genotoxicity profiles on the Saos-II cell line , it could be concluded that FA/BG , like HA/BG , could be a good candidate for further in vivo biocompatibility studies to be used in bone tissue repair.
