  The purpose of this research was to compare gesture-function mappings for experts and novices using a 3D , vision-based , gestural input system when exposed to the same context of anesthesia tasks in the operating room ( OR). 3D , vision-based , gestural input systems can serve as a natural way to interact with computers and are potentially useful in sterile environments ( e.g. , ORs) to limit the spread of bacteria. Anesthesia providers ' hands have been linked to bacterial transfer in the OR , but a gestural input system for anesthetic tasks has not been investigated. A repeated-measures study was conducted with two cohorts: anesthesia providers ( i.e. , experts) ( N = 16) and students ( i.e. , novices) ( N = 30). Participants chose gestures for 10 anesthetic functions across three blocks to determine intuitive gesture-function mappings. Reaction time was collected as a complementary measure for understanding the mappings. The two gesture-function mapping sets showed some similarities and differences. The gesture mappings of the anesthesia providers showed a relationship to physical components in the anesthesia environment that were not seen in the students ' gestures. The students also exhibited evidence related to longer reaction times compared to the anesthesia providers. Domain expertise is influential when creating gesture-function mappings. However , both experts and novices should be able to use a gesture system intuitively , so development methods need to be refined for considering the needs of different user groups. The development of a touchless interface for perioperative anesthesia may reduce bacterial contamination and eventually offer a reduced risk of infection to patients.
