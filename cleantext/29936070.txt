  The missing phenylalanine at position 508 , located in nucleotide-binding domain ( NBD1) of the cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> transmembrane regulator ( CFTR) , is the most common cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease> mutation. Severe disease-causing mutations also occur in NBD2. To provide information on potential therapeutic strategies for mutations in NBD2 , we used a combination of biochemical , cell biological and electrophysiological approaches and newly created cell lines to study two disease-causing NBD2 mutants , N1303K and S1235R. We observed that neither was sensitive to E64 , a cysteine protease inhibitor. However , further investigation showed that when treated with a combination of correctors , C4 + C18 , both mutants also responded to E64. Further exploration to assess aggresome throughput using the autophagy regulator LC3 as a marker showed that , in the absence of correctors , N1303K showed a stalled throughput of LC3-II to the aggresome. The throughput became active again after treatment with the corrector combination C4 + C18. Confocal microscopic studies showed that the N1303K and S1235R mutant proteins both co-localized with LC3 , but this co-localization was abolished by the corrector combination and , to a lesser extent , by VX-809. Both the corrector combination and VX-809 increased the CFTR chloride channel function of both mutants. We conclude that correctors have a dual effect , particularly on N1303K: they improve trafficking and function at the plasma membrane and reduce the association with autophagosomes. After treatment with correctors persistent degradation by the autophagosome may limit restoration of function. Thus , mutations in NBD2 of CFTR , in contrast to Î”F508-CFTR , may require additional personalized strategies to rescue them.
