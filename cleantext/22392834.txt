  To assess the effect of testosterone treatment on bone remodelling and density in dieting obese men , 100 obese men aged 53 years ( interquartile range 47-60) with a total testosterone level < 12 nmol/L receiving 10 weeks of a very low energy diet ( VLED) followed by 46 weeks of weight maintenance were randomly assigned at baseline to 56 weeks of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate ( n = 49 , cases) or matching placebo ( n = 51 , controls). Pre-specified outcomes were between-group differences ( mean adjusted difference , MAD) in serum c-telopeptide ( CTx) , N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen ( P1NP) and bone mineral density ( BMD). At trial end , CTx was significantly reduced in men receiving testosterone compared to placebo , MAD -66 ng/L ( 95 % CI -113 , -18) , p = 0.018 , and this was apparent already after the 10 week VLED phase , MAD -63 ng/L ( 95 % CI -108 , -18) , p = 0.018. P1NP was marginally increased after VLED , MAD +4.2 ug/L ( 95 % CI -0.01 , +8.4) , p = 0.05 but lower at study end , MAD -5.6 ug/L ( 95 % CI -10.1 , -1.1) , p = 0.03. No significant changes in sclerostin , lumbar spine BMD or femoral BMD were seen. We conclude that in obese men with low testosterone levels undergoing weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , bone remodelling markers are modulated in a way that may have favourable effects on bone mass.
