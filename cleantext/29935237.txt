  7,8-Dihydroxyflavone ( 7,8-DHF) is a small molecular weight compound that mimics the functions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF). The current study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanism of 7,8-DHF-induced body<symptom> weight regulation. Obese female C57/BL6 ( 20-week-old) mice that have been fed with high-fat diet for 13 weeks were treated with 7,8-DHF for 9 weeks. Various biochemical and molecular analyses were performed to examine the signal transduction pathway , metabolite content , and mitochondrial mass in the animals. Moreover , systemic energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity were determined by indirect calorimetry and insulin/glucose-tolerance tests. We have also determined the metabolic actions of 7,8-DHF on cultured myotubes. 7,8-DHF treatment increased cellular respiration<symptom> by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis in cultured skeletal muscle cells. In diet-induced obese mice , subsequent 7,8-DHF consumption triggered the AMPK/CREB/PGC -1 Î± pathways to increase the muscular mitochondrial content. Systemic energy metabolism was thus elevated , which reduced the body<symptom> weight gain in obese animals. Consequently , hyperlipidemia , hyperglycemia hyperinsulinemia , and ectopic lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle and liver of the obese animals were alleviated after 7,8-DHF treatment. Moreover , insulin sensitivity of the obese muscle was improved after 7,8-DHF consumption. 7,8-DHF treatment increases muscular mitochondrial respiration<symptom> and systemic energy expenditure , which alleviates the body<symptom> weight gain and partially reverse the metabolic abnormalities induced by obesity.
