  We report on a retrospective population study aimed at identifying and validating the progression of adapted Diabetes Complications Severity Index ( DCSI) for acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) , ischemic stroke , and mortality in Asian people with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM). Utilizing a Taiwanese national dataset , we included 84450 type 2 diabetic individuals between 2000 and 2011. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( C statistics of logistic model) and the C statistics of the Cox model were used to evaluate whether the progression of diabetic complication status could be a predictor of ACS , ischemic stroke , and death. The optimum threshold for adverse outcomes risk stratification were obtained using Youden 's J statistic as the cutoff that gives the highest threshold. Among the study patients , the C statistics of the logistic model of the progression of the score predictive of ACS , ischemic stroke , and death were 0.72 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.71-0.73) , 0.84 ( 95 % CI: 0.84-0.85) , and 0.66 ( 95 % CI: 0.65-0.67) , respectively. The progression of adapted DCSI had moderate discrimination for ACS , ischemic stroke , and death ( C statistics = 0.71 , 0.72 , and 0.75 , respectively) based on Cox regression analysis ( Harrell C). The optimum threshold of the progression of the score for ACS , ischemic stroke , and death in type 2 DM patients were 0.30 , 0.36 , and 0.39 , respectively. The acceptable discriminative power of the progression of adapted DCSI for Asian people affected by type 2 DM was demonstrated in a large cohort in Taiwan.
