  Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) is the most common arrhythmia. The most common diagnostic method , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG) , can record episodes of arrhythmia from which the type and severity can be determined. The Heart Spectrum Blood<symptom> Pressure<symptom> Monitor ( P2; OSTAR Meditech Corp. , New Taipei City , Taiwan) is used to measure cardiovascular pressure change with fast Fourier transform ( FFT) analysis to obtain heart rate frequency variability and accurate blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> data. We compared the diagnostic efficacy of the Heart Spectrum Blood<symptom> Pressure<symptom> Monitor to a 12-lead ECG ( gold standard) for patients with AF. Three measurement methods were used in this study to analyze the heart index and compare the results with simultaneous 12-lead ECG: blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>; mean arterial pressure , which was calculated from individual blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> as a constant pressure; and a constant pressure of 60 mmHg. The physician used a 12-lead ECG and the Heart Spectrum Blood<symptom> Pressure<symptom> Monitor simultaneously. The Heart Spectrum Blood<symptom> Pressure<symptom> Monitor used FFT analysis to diagnose AF , and the findings were compared to the 12-lead ECG readings. This unblinded clinical trial was conducted in the emergency department of Taipei Medical University Hospital. Twenty-nine subjects with AF and 33 without AF aged 25 to 97 y ( mean , 63.5 y) were included. Subjects who were exposed to high-frequency surgical equipment during testing , those with cardiac pacemakers or implantable defibrillators , and pregnant women were excluded. The sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV) , and negative predictive value ( NPV) were 97 % , 97 % , 97 % , and 97 % , respectively , for method 1; 90 % , 100 % , 100 % , and 91 % , respectively , for method 2; and 100 % , 94 % , 94 % , and 100 % , respectively , for method 3. The sensitivity , specificity , PPV , and NPV for both methods ranged between 90 % and 100 % , indicating that the Heart Spectrum Blood<symptom> Pressure<symptom> Monitor can be effectively applied for AF detection.
