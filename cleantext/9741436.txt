  Most of studies suggest the cup inclination angle is controversial. All of the studies previous have not control the prosthesis type and head diameter , it is difficult to determine relative or synergistic effects of cup angle. We retrospectively reviewed 54 patients ( 61 hips) with primary total hip arthroplasties which cup inclination angle bigger than 50 The preoperative mean Harris hip score improved from 47.36 to 94.3 points at 10 years. The survivorship of the cup was 100 % at 10 years. The mean rate of liner wear was 0.144 Â± 0.031 mm/y ( 0.105-0.178 mm/y) in cup inclination angle between 50 For the metal-on-polyethylene prostheses , the liner wear obvious correlate with cup inclination after angle bigger than 50
