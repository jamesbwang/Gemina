  Previous investigations revealed influences of irradiation up to 2.0 Gy on the cytokine secretion profile of inflammatory , peritoneal mouse macrophages ( pMФ). This raised the question if those alterations impact on dendritic cells and consecutive T-cell responses. Further , the impact of irradiation directly on pMФ capacity to induce T-cell responses was analyzed. pMФ were LPS-activated , irradiated and the expression of activation markers was assessed. Treated pMФ were co-incubated with T-cells to investigate proliferation. To verify modulating properties of pMФ supernatants isolated 24 h after irradiation , bone marrow-derived dendritic cells ( BMDC) were co-incubated with supernatants and activation markers as well as the BMDC-induced proliferation of T-cells were measured. pMФ showed a highly significantly decreased MHCII expression within a dose range from 0.7 to 2.0 Gy. Further , the proliferation rate of CD4 Inflammatory macrophages being exposed to irradiation have the potential to modulate consecutive adaptive immune reactions. But supernatants of irradiated macrophages do not influence the DC-mediated induction of T cell proliferation.
