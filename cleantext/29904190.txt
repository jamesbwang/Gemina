  This was a qualitative study conducted using an interpretative phenomenological approach. This study investigated the experience of pregnancy and childbirth in women with spinal cord injury ( SCI). Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Research Center , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran. The data were collected using telecommunication and face-to-face semi-structured interviews with eight women with SCI. The study employed the interpretative phenomenological approach suggested by Van Manen in 2016 and thematic analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of the childbearing experience of women with SCI. MAXQDA 10 software was used to manage the collected data. Five main themes have emerged from data analysis: `` revivification '' , `` fear and concern of motherhood with SCI '' , `` flawed health care system '' , `` maternal experience under a supportive umbrella '' , and `` strengthening spirituality and religious belief ''. Childbearing had a positive effect on the family relationship , continuity of marriage , and quality of life following SCI. There are potential benefits in establishing a center that provides consultation on childbearing and childcare for women with SCI. Moreover , training for the medical team , which includes nurses , midwives , and specialists is highly recommended. Further research is needed to expand our understanding of childbearing from the perspectives of healthcare providers.
