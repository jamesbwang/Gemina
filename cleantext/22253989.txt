  The aim of this study ( first analytical approach) was to obtain data concerning the fatty acid composition of gluten-free foods ( bakery products) for celiac people. The study included 35 different products ( snacks , biscuits , bakery products , pasta , flours , etc.) from several manufacturers. After extraction and esterification , the fatty acid composition was determined by Gaschromatography ( GC ‚Åª MS) Monounsaturated fatty acids ( MUFAs) were found to be the major constituents ( 57 %) , followed by saturated fatty acids ( SFAs) ( 30 %) , and polyunsaturated fatty acid ( 13 %). Only 15 of the 35 gluten-free samples analyzed appeared to provide adequate energy intake , while , in 11 samples , saturated fatty acids were found to supply more energy than that recommended by the European Food Safety Authority EFSA. Moreover , data analyses showed that , although gluten-free commercial products are high added-value foods , industrial products in many cases contain palm and palm kernel oils , whereas the local producers generally use the finest raw materials , such as olive oil.
