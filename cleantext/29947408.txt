  Tissue engineering is an emergent and very interesting research field , providing potential solutions for a myriad of challenges in healthcare. Fibrous scaffolds specifically have shown promise as an effective tissue engineering method , as their high length-to-width ratio mimics that of extracellular matrix components , which in turn guides tissue formation , promotes cellular adhesion and improves mechanical properties. In this review paper , we discuss in detail both the importance of fibrous scaffolds for the promotion of tissue growth and the different methods to produce fibrous biomaterials to possess favorable and unique characteristics. Here , we focus on the pressing need to develop biomimetic structures that promote an ideal environment to encourage tissue formation. In addition , we discuss different biomedical applications in which fibrous scaffolds can be useful , identifying their importance , relevant aspects , and remaining significant challenges. In conclusion , we provide comments on the future direction of fibrous scaffolds and the best way to produce them , proposed in light of recent technological advances and the newest and most promising fabrication techniques.
