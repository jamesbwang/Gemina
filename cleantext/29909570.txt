  A large number of DNAs in eukaryote genomes can code for atypical transcripts , and their functions are controversial. It has been reported that the transcripts contain many small open reading frames ( sORFs) , which were originally considered as non-translatable RNAs. However , increasing evidence has suggested that some of these sORFs can encode for small peptides and some are conserved across large evolutionary distances. It has been reported that the small peptides have functions and may be involved in varieties of cellular processes , playing important roles in development , physiology , and metabolism. Among the sORFs , studies of the non-canonical gene polished rice/tarsal-less ( pri/tal) in Drosophila and mille-pattes ( mlpt) in Tribolium have been more thoroughly studied. The genes similar to pri/tal in other species have been defined as the tarsal-less-related gene family , tal-like gene. In this review , we described recent progress in the discovery and functional characterization of the small peptides encoded by the tal-like gene and their possible functional potentials.
