  Cognition is an important outcome in many clinical trials. The NIH Toolbox-Cognition Battery ( NIHTB-CB) is a computerized cognitive assessment designed for clinical research that is administered in-person. Here , we evaluated the equivalency of a novel videoconference protocol for administering the NIHTB-CB. Since our protocol required repeated assessments , we further explored the NIHTB-CB 's practice effect. Twenty-five healthy participants completed the NIHTB-CB under two separate conditions 4 weeks apart. The standard condition followed the recommended administration protocol , whereas the videoconference condition had the examiner and participant in separate rooms but able to communicate over videoconference. A linear mixed-model analysis was performed to explore the fixed effect of testing condition and time on NIHTB-CB performance. Across all three NIHTB-CB composite scores ( total , fluid , and crystallized cognition) , no significant fixed effect of administration condition was found. A significant practice effect was observed for the fluid and total cognition composite scores over a 29.0 ( Â± 2.1) day test-retest interval. Our novel videoconference protocol for the NIHTB-CB is equivalent to the standard protocol in healthy participants , and may provide a solution for researchers seeking to engage study participants at remote sites. If the NIHTB-CB is used longitudinally to monitor patients , corrections for repeated measures may be required.
