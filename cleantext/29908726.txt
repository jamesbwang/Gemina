  Hypertension is a common and difficult-to-treat condition; digital health tools may serve as adjuncts to traditional pharmaceutical and lifestyle-based interventions. Using a retrospective observational study we sought to evaluate the effect of a desktop and mobile digital health intervention ( DHI) as an adjunct to a workplace health program in those previously diagnosed with hypertension. As part of a workplace health program , 3330 patients were identified as previously diagnosed with hypertension. A DHI was made available to participants providing motivational and educational materials assisting in the management of hypertension. We evaluated changes in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , weight , and body mass index ( BMI) between users and nonusers based on login frequency to the DHI using multivariate regression through the five visits over the course of 1 year. One thousand six hundred twenty-two ( 49 %) participants logged into the application at least once. DHI users had significant greater improvements in systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( SBP; -2.79 mm Hg) , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( -2.12 mm Hg) , and BMI ( -0.23 kg/m This large , observational study provides evidence that a DHI as an adjunct to a workplace health program is associated with greater improvement in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and BMI at 1 year. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that DHIs may be useful in augmenting the treatment of hypertension in addition to traditional management with pharmaceuticals and lifestyle changes.
