  The study aim was to develop 2 scales: predicting clinical gains and risk of acute side effects of stimulant medication in pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) , combining measures from EEG spectra , event-related potentials ( ERPs) , and a cued visual GO/NOGO task. Based on 4-week systematic medication trials , 87 ADHD patients aged 8 to 17 years were classified as responders ( REs , n = 62) or non-REs ( n = 25) , and belonging to the side effects ( SEs , n = 42) or no-SEs ( n = 45) groups. Before starting the trial , a 19-channel EEG was registered twice: Test 1 ( T1) without medication and T2 on a single dose of stimulant medication a few days before the trial. EEG was registered T1 and T2: 3 minutes eyes-closed , 3 minutes eyes-open , and 20 minutes cued GO/NOGO. EEG spectra , ERPs , omissions , commissions , reaction time ( RT) , and RT variability were computed. Groups were compared at T1 and T2 on quantitative EEG ( qEEG) , ERPs and behavioral parameters; effect sizes ( d) were estimated. Variables with d > 0.5 were converted to quartiles , multiplied by corresponding d , and summed to obtain 2 global scales. Six variables differed significantly between REs and non-REs ( T1: theta/alpha ratio , P3NOGO amplitude. Differences T2-T1: Omissions , RT variability , P3NOGO , contingent negative variation ( CNV)). The global scale d was 1.86. Accuracy ( receiver operating characteristic) was 0.92. SEs and no-SEs differed significantly on 4 variables. ( T1: RT , T2: novelty component and alpha peak frequency , and RT changes. Global scale d = 1.08 and accuracy = 0.78. Gains and side effects of stimulants in pediatric ADHD can be predicted with high accuracy by combining EEG spectra , ERPs , and behavior from baseline and single-dose tests.
