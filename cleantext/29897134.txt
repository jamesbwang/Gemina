  Youths with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD) are at risk for developing anxiety<symptom> and depressive symptoms with a reported 20 % -50 % prevalence rate. This prospective study aimed to: ( 1) describe the prevalence and severity of anxiety<symptom> and depressive symptoms in a large Dutch cohort of young IBD patients , and ( 2) identify demographic and clinical risk factors for anxiety<symptom> and depression<symptom> IBD patients ( n = 374; 10-25 years) were screened for anxiety<symptom> , depression<symptom> and quality of life using validated age-specific questionnaires. Patients with elevated scores for anxiety<symptom> and/or depressive symptoms received a diagnostic interview assessing psychiatric disorders. Demographic and clinical characteristics were retrieved from medical charts. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for anxiety<symptom> and/or depression<symptom> Patients ( mean age 18.9 years , 44.1 % male , Crohn 's disease 60.4 %) had disease in remission ( 75.4 %) , or mild , moderate and severe clinical disease activity in , respectively , 19.8 % , 2.7 % and 2.1 %. Mild anxiety/depressive symptoms were present in 35.2 % and severe<symptom> symptoms<symptom> in 12.4 % of patients. Elevated symptoms of either anxiety<symptom> ( 28.3 %) , depression<symptom> ( 2.9 %) or both ( 15.8 %) were found and did not differ between adolescents ( 10-17 years) and young adults ( 18-25 years). Active disease significantly predicted depressive symptoms ( odds ratio ( OR): 4.6 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 2.4-8.8) , P < 0.001). Female gender ( OR: 1.7 ( 95 % CI: 1.1-2.7)) , active disease ( OR: 1.9 ( 95 % CI: 1.1-3.2)) and a shorter disease duration ( OR: 1.3 ( 95 % CI: 0.6-1.0) ( all P < 0.025) significantly predicted anxiety<symptom> and/or depressive symptoms. Considering the high prevalence of anxiety<symptom> and depressive symptoms , psychological screening is recommended in young IBD patients. Screening facilitates early recognition and psychological treatment. Female patients and patients with active disease are the most vulnerable.
