  Momordica charantia bioactive polysaccharide ( MCBP) was used as an alternative source for the production of bio-based plastics ( BPs) with choline chloride/glycerol-based deep eutectic solvent ( DES) as a plasticizer. In this study , MCBP was initially extracted using 0.1 M citric acid at temperature 80 °C for 2 h , precipitated using ethanol , and then lyophilized. Subsequently , seven BPs were prepared: MCBP without plasticizer ( MCBP) , with 1 % ( w/w) of glycerol ( MCBP-G) , or with 1 % ( w/w) of DES at different choline chloride/glycerol molar ratios ( i.e. 1.5:1 , 1:1 , 1:1.5 , 1:2 , and 1:3). The properties of these BPs were then investigated. Results showed that the tensile strains , stresses and moduli were in the range of 1.3-13.3 % , 4.8-19.1 MPa and 132-2487 MPa , respectively. The melting temperatures were found in the range of 92.6-111.4 °C whereas the moisture absorptions and water vapour transmission rates ( WVTR) of BPs were 1.4-6.5 % and 3.6-5.4 mg/m
