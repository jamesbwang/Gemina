  The occurrence , spatiotemporal distribution and ecological risks of 27 antibiotics in water and sediments from rivers and coastal area of Zhuhai , Pearl River estuary , south China were investigated. Higher concentrations of antibiotics were found in river water in dry season than those in wet season ( p < 0.01) , especially for quinolones ( QNs) ( 6.36-463 ng/L) and aminoglycosides ( AGs) ( 94.9-458 ng/L). In coastal water samples , the concentrations of antibiotics were up to 419 ng/L and 357 ng/L in dry season and wet season , respectively. Higher concentrations of antibiotics in coastal sediment samples were observed in wet season compared with those in dry season ( p < 0.01). This may be ascribed to the greater discharge of antibiotics from mariculture and surface sediment flushing in wet season , leading to the accumulation of polluted sediments in the estuary. Redundancy analysis showed that the concentrations of antibiotics in water were correlated with biological/chemical oxygen demand , ammonia<pathogen> nitrogen , and/or total nitrogen ( TN). In addition , sediment organic matter ( SOC) and TN strongly affected the distribution of antibiotics in sediments. Ecological risk assessment based on risk quotients ( RQs) indicated that most antibiotics in water samples posed insignificant risk to fish and green algae<pathogen> , and insignificant to medium risk to daphnid.
