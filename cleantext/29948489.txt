  The present study investigated the regional blood flow , tissue distribution , local anesthetic action , and hemodynamic effects of mepivacaine containing dexmedetomidine hydrochloride ( DEX) in rats. Blood flow was measured after injection of 0.5 % mepivacaine ( M group) , 12.5 µg/ml DEX ( D group) , or 0.5 % mepivacaine containing 12.5 µg/ml DEX ( DM group) into the upper lip. Mepivacaine distribution was autoradiographically observed in maxillary bone resected after injection of 0.5 %
