  We report new K-Ar isochron data for two ~ 380 Ma basaltic rocks , using an updated version of the Potassium-Argon Laser Experiment ( KArLE) , which is being developed for future in situ dating of planetary materials. These basalts have K contents comparable with those of lunar KREEP basalts or igneous lithologies found by Mars rovers , whereas previous proof-of-concept studies focused primarily on more K-rich rocks. We aim to measure these analogue samples to show the advancing capability of in situ K-Ar geochronology. Combining laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ( LIBS) , mass spectrometry ( MS) , and microscopic analyses , we measured the abundance of K and Despite much lower K abundances than in previous studies , the isochron slopes yielded 380 ± 44 Ma and 398 ± 50 Ma for 380.7-Ma and 373.5-Ma rocks , respectively , indicating that accuracy better than 25 Ma ( < 7 %) is achievable with our instrument. The isochron intercepts both yielded trapped Our experimental results demonstrate that accurate and precise measurements are possible using the KArLE approach on basaltic rocks , which are ubiquitous on planetary surfaces and are useful in addressing a wide range of questions in planetary science.
