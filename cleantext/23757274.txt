  The increase of extreme drought and precipitation events due to climate change will alter microbial processes. Perturbation experiments demonstrated that microbes are sensitive to environmental alterations. However , only little is known on the legacy effects in microbial systems. Here , we designed a laboratory microcosm experiment using aerobic methane-consuming communities as a model system to test basic principles of microbial resilience and the role of changes in biomass and the presence of non-methanotrophic microbes in this process. We focused on enrichments from soil , sediment , and water reflecting communities with different legacy with respect to exposure to drought. Recovery rates , a recently proposed early warning indicator of a critical transition , were utilized as a measure to detect resilience loss of methane consumption during a series of dry/wet cycle perturbations. We observed a slowed recovery of enrichments originating from water samples , which suggests that the community 's legacy with a perturbation is a contributing factor for the resilience of microbial functioning.
