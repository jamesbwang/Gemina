  Applications of multiphoton processes in lanthanide-doped nanophosphors ( NPs) are often limited by relatively weak and narrow absorbance. Here , the concept of an ultimate photosensitization by aggregation-induced enhanced emission ( AIEE) dyes to overcome this limitation is introduced. Because AIEE dyes do not suffer from concentration quenching , they can fully cover the NP surface at high density to maximize absorbance while passivating the surface. This concept is applied to multiphoton down-conversion by quantum cutting. Specifically , coating Yb
