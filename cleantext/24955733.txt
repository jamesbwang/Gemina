  Collected specimens for research purposes may or may not be made available depending on their scarcity and/or on the project needs. Their protection against degradation or in the event of an incident is pivotal. Duplication and storage on a different site is the best way to assure their sustainability. The conservation of samples at room temperature ( RT) by duplication can facilitate their protection. We describe a security system for the collection of non-small cell lung cancers ( NSCLC) stored in the biobank of the Nice Hospital Center , France , by duplication and conservation of lyophilized ( dried) , encapsulated DNA kept at RT.. Therefore , three frozen tissue collections from non-smoking , early stage and sarcomatoid carcinoma NSCLC patients were selected for this study. DNA was extracted , lyophilized and encapsulated at RT under anoxic conditions using the DNAshell technology. In total , 1974 samples from 987 patients were encapsulated. Six and two capsules from each sample were stored in the biobanks of the Nice and Grenoble ( France) Hospitals , respectively. In conclusion , DNA maintained at RT allows for the conservation , duplication and durability of collections of interest stored in biobanks. This is a low-cost and safe technology that requires a limited amount of space and has a low environmental impact.
