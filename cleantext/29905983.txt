  Liver glycogen phosphorylase ( GP) is a key enzyme for human health , as its increased activity is associated with type 2 diabetes. The GP catalytic mechanism has been explored by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics ( QM/MM) methods. Herein , we propose a mechanism that proceeds by three steps: 1) it begins with transfer of a hydrogen atom from the phosphate group of the pyridoxal 5 '- phosphate ( HPO
