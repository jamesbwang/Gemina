  Glutamic and aspartic acid fulfil numerous functions in organisms. They are proteinogenic amino acids , they function as neurotransmitters , and glutamic acid links the citrate cycle with amino acid metabolism. In addition , glutamic acid is a precursor for many bioactive molecules like & gamma;- aminobutyric acid ( GABA). In tomatoes , glutamic acid accumulates in ripening fruits. Here we present a simple and rapid method for quantification of glutamate and aspartate in tomatoes. A cleared extract is prepared and 2-aminoadipic acid added as internal standard. Subsequently , the amino acids are derivatised with 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene under alkaline conditions. The derivatives are separated by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography using a phenyl-hexyl column and 50 mM
