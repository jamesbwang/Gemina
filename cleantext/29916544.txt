  3 ( 5‑hydroxymethyl‑2‑furyl) 1‑benzyl‑indazole ( YC‑1) is understood to protect against ischemic stroke , but the molecular basis for its neuroprotection remains to be fully characterized. The present study investigated the influence of YC‑1 on inflammatory responses following experimental stroke. Previous studies indicated that nuclear factor ( NF) κB‑driven signals serve a pivotal role in mediating inflammatory responses following stroke. Ischemic stroke results in activation of NF‑κB to induce gene expression of factors including inducible nitric oxide synthase , interleukin ( IL) 1β , IL‑6 and matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs). The results of the present study demonstrated that YC‑1 effectively reduced brain infarction and brain edema<symptom> , and improved blood‑brain barrier leakage. Additionally , animals treated with YC‑1 exhibited significant reductions in neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into the ischemic brain. Furthermore , YC‑1 effectively inhibited NF‑κB translocation and binding activity , and the activity and expression of MMP‑9 following ischemic stroke. In conclusion , YC‑1 may effectively attenuate NF‑κB‑induced inflammatory damage following cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion.
