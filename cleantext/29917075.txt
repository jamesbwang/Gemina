  Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2) segregate with familial Parkinson 's disease ( PD) and genetic variation around LRRK2 contributes to risk of sporadic disease. Although knockout of LRRK2 or knock-in of pathogenic mutations into the mouse germline does not result in a PD phenotype , several defects have been reported in the kidneys of LRRK2 knockout mice. To understand LRRK2 function in vivo , we used an unbiased approach to determine which protein pathways are affected in LRRK2 knockout kidneys. We nominated changes in cytoskeletal-associated proteins , lysosomal proteases , proteins involved in vesicular trafficking and in control of protein translation. Changes were not seen in mice expressing the pathogenic G2019S LRRK2 mutation. Using cultured epithelial kidney cells , we replicated the accumulation of lysosomal proteases and demonstrated changes in subcellular distribution of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor. These results show that loss of LRRK2 leads to co-ordinated responses in protein translation and trafficking and argue against a dominant negative role for the G2019S mutation.
