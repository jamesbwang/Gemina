  Episodic future thinking is the ability to mentally project oneself into the future. This construct has been explored extensively in cognitive neuroscience and may be relevant for adaptive functioning. However , it has not been determined whether the measurement of episodic future thinking might be valuable in a clinical neuropsychological setting. The current study investigated ( 1) the relationship between episodic future thinking and instrumental activities of daily living ( IADLs); and ( 2) whether episodic future thinking is related to IADLs over and above standard measures of cognition. Sixty-one older adults with heterogeneous neurological conditions and 41 healthy older adults completed a future thinking task ( the adapted Autobiographical Interview) , a performance-based measure of instrumental activities of daily living ( the Independent Living Scales) , and standard clinical measures of memory and executive functioning. Episodic future thinking significantly predicted IADLs after accounting for age , education , gender , and depression<symptom> ( increase in R2 = .050 , p = .010). Episodic future thinking significantly predicted IADLs over and above executive functioning ( increase in R2 = .025 , p = .030) , but was not predictive of IADLs over and above memory ( p = .157). This study suggests that episodic future thinking is significantly associated with IADLs , beyond what can be accounted for by executive functioning. However , episodic future thinking did not predict IADLs over and above memory. Overall , there is limited evidence for the clinical utility of episodic future thinking. The findings suggest that an episodic future thinking task does not provide enough valuable information about IADLs to justify its inclusion in a clinical neuropsychological setting.
