  Graphene has recently attracted particular interest as a flexible barrier film preventing permeation of gases and moistures. However , it has been proved to be exceptionally challenging to develop large-scale graphene films with little oxygen and moisture permeation suitable for industrial uses , mainly due to the presence of nanometer-sized defects of obscure origins. Here , the origins of water permeable routes on graphene-coated Cu foils are investigated by observing the micrometer-sized rusts in the underlying Cu substrates , and a site-selective passivation method of the nanometer-sized routes is devised. It is revealed that nanometer-sized holes or cracks are primarily concentrated on graphene wrinkles rather than on other structural imperfections , resulting in severe degradation of its water impermeability. They are found to be predominantly induced by the delamination of graphene bound to Cu as a release of thermal stress during the cooling stage after graphene growth , especially at the intersection of the Cu step edges and wrinkles owing to their higher adhesion energy. Furthermore , the investigated routes are site-selectively passivated by an electron-beam-induced amorphous carbon layer , thus a substantial improvement in water impermeability is achieved. This approach is likely to be extended for offering novel barrier properties in flexible films based on graphene and on other atomic crystals.
