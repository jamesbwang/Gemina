  Cases of low-energy-induced distal radius fracture ( DRF) are increasing. Sarcopenia is considered to be an independent risk factor for fragility fractures. We compared body appendicular lean muscle mass ( ALM) and bone mineral density ( BMD) in patients with DRF and a comparable control population. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between skeletal muscle mass and DRF. We performed a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with fragility DRF. The DRF group included 87 patients treated at our institute. The control group comprised data for 87 individuals in the general population from among 2,124 selected using nearest-neighbor propensity scoring , based on age , weight , height , and body mass index. All medical conditions and past history were also compared between the two groups. The relative overall ALM , combining arm and leg lean body mass divided by height squared , was not significantly different ( DRF group , 6.093 kg/m Patients with DRF did not have significantly lower average lean body mass. BMD was significantly lower in patients with DRF than in controls.
