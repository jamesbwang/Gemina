  Perinatal asphyxia in the neonatal brain triggers a robust inflammatory response in which nitric oxide ( NO) generation plays a hazardous role. Increased levels of NO can be maintained by the activity of inducible NO synthase ( NOS2A) on its own or activated by IL-1beta ( IL-1β) gene transcription and positive back stimulation of the NOS2 ( CCTTT) n microsatellite by IL-1β , thus potentiating brain injury after ischemic perinatal asphyxia. We investigated whether the risk for cerebral palsy ( CP) increases when an expansion of the- 2.5 kb ( CCTTT) n microsatellite in the NOS2A gene and a single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP) in- C511T of the IL- IL-1β gene promoter occur in patients after perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Genomic DNA was purified from peripheral leukocytes of 48 patients with CP and of 57 healthy control children. IL-1β SNP genotypes were established using a real-time PCR technique and fluorogenic probes and were validated by restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP) analysis using the AvaI restriction enzyme. The length of the CCTTTn microsatellite in the NOS2 gene promoter was determined by automated sequencing. The 14 repeat-long allele of the CCTTTn NOS2A microsatellite was present in 27 % of CP patients vs 12.3 % of controls , showing an odds ratio ( OR) = 2.6531 and 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.9612-7.3232 ( P < 0.0469). The -511 TT genotype frequency showed an OR = 2.6325 ( 95 % CI = 1.1348-6.1066 , P = 0.0189). Interestingly , the haplotype CCTTT
