  This document presents the American Thoracic Society clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD). Clinicians investigating adult and pediatric patients for possible PCD. Systematic reviews and , when appropriate , meta-analyses were conducted to summarize all available evidence pertinent to our clinical questions. Evidence was assessed using the GRADE ( Grading of Recommendations , Assessment , Development and Evaluation) approach for diagnosis and discussed by a multidisciplinary panel with expertise in PCD. Predetermined conflict-of-interest management strategies were applied , and recommendations were formulated , written , and graded exclusively by the nonconflicted panelists. Three conflicted individuals were also prohibited from writing , editing , or providing feedback on the relevant sections of the manuscript. After considering diagnostic test accuracy , confidence in the estimates for each diagnostic test , relative importance of test results studied , desirable and undesirable direct consequences of each diagnostic test , downstream consequences of each diagnostic test result , patient values and preferences , costs , feasibility , acceptability , and implications for health equity , the panel made recommendations for or against the use of specific diagnostic tests as compared with using the current reference standard ( transmission electron microscopy and/or genetic testing) for the diagnosis of PCD. The panel formulated and provided a rationale for the direction as well as for the strength of each recommendation to establish the diagnosis of PCD.
