  Multisubstituted ortho-anisidines were efficiently synthesized via cationic N-heterocyclic carbene-Cu-catalyzed domino rearrangement of N-methoxyanilines that possess an electron-donating functional group , such as an alkyl or an aryl group , at the ortho position. The reaction proceeded first through a ( 1,3)- rearrangement of the methoxy group to the ortho position bound to the electron-donating substituent , followed by a semipinacol type ( 1,2)- rearrangement of the electron-donating group from the ortho to the meta position. Mechanistic studies suggest that both rearrangement reactions are promoted by a cationic Cu catalyst.
