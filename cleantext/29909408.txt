  To assess the natural disease progression of high myopia in Caucasians considered at risk for the development of myopic choroidal neovascularization ( mCNV). Subjects were recruited in 25 clinical sites between June 2014 and June 2016. Main inclusion criteria included axial length of ≥ 26 mm , best-corrected visual acuity ≥ 0.05 decimal equivalent and presence of at least one out of five predefined morphological disease risk criteria. These were ( 1) subfoveal choroidal thinning < 50 µm , ( 2) enhanced choroidal curvature length > 6,300 µm , ( 3) lacquer cracks , ( 4) patchy atrophy > 5 mm2 and ( 5) preexisting mCNV in the fellow eye ( German Clinical Trial Register DRKS00007761). A total of 150 participants ( 66 % females) with a mean age of 57.2 ( ± 12.7) years ( range 21.9-86.2 years) were included. The disease criteria most frequently encountered were choroidal thinning ( 33.3 %) and lacquer cracks ( 32.7 %). Enhanced choroidal curvature length was detected in only 8 subjects and always occurred in combination with other disease criteria. Presence of patchy atrophy was found to be more common in older subjects ( p = 0.0012) and also associated with a more severe disease manifestation. The baseline data of this study indicate that enhanced choroidal curvature might be less common in Caucasians than in Asian populations. Further , disease severity in patients with high myopia is relatively high in the presence of patchy atrophy.
