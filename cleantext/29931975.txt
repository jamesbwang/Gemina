  π-Conjugated organoboron molecules , which are easy to prepare , stable against moisture , and easy to functionalize , are scarce. Here , we report a one-pot synthesis of an air-stable organoboron compound , dithienooxadiborepine 1 in 17 % yield on a 600 mg scale without separation or handling an air-sensitive intermediate. Dithienooxadiborepine 1 showed excellent stability under ambient conditions , allowing conventional column chromatography purification. Functionalization of 1 was realized via direct bromination using NBS and further Stille coupling reactions , giving access to longer π-conjugated molecules 5A and 5B. Single-crystal structures of compounds 4 , 5A , and 5B not only unambiguously verified the chemical identity of dithienooxadiborepine 1 but also revealed that both the seven-member oxadiborepine ring and the 5-7-5 fused dithienooxadiborepine ring system are planar. UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission measurements of 5A and 5B showed bathochromic shifted absorption and emission relative to 1 , evidencing good π-conjugation. Cyclic voltammograms of 5A and 5B displayed two reduction peaks corresponding to two electron-accepting events at two boron atoms. These results proved dithienooxadiborepine 1 a potent π-conjugating building block for electron-accepting materials.
