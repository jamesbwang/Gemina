  Sadness increases how much decision makers pay to acquire goods , even when decision makers are unaware of it. This effect is coined the `` misery-is-not-miserly effect ''. The paper that first established this effect is the second most-cited article appearing in Psychological Science in 2004. In light of its impact , the present study sought to assess whether the misery-is-not-miserly effect would replicate ( a) in a novel context and ( b) even when another way of alleviating a sense of loss ( i.e. , compensatory consumption) was available. Results revealed that the effect replicated in the novel context and , despite a prediction otherwise , even when individuals had an opportunity to engage in compensatory consumption. Moreover , a meta-analysis of the original effect and that observed in the present study yielded a small-to-medium effect ( Cohen 's d = 0.43). As such , the present study lends evidentiary support to the misery-is-not-miserly effect and provides impetus for future research exploring the impact of sadness on consumer decision-making , specifically , and of emotion on decision processes , more generally.
