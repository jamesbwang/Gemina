  Analysis of a huge human pedigree constructed using public genealogy databases indicates that the heritability of longevity is probably lower than previously accepted ( 0.10 to 0.15 instead of 0.25 to 0.30). This makes the search for `` longevity genes '' even harder than expected; nevertheless , some significant results emerge and may eventually , after confirmation and extension , provide useful insights.
