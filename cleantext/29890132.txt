  This study explored the feasibility of constructing a tissue engineered muscle layer in the oesophagus using oesophageal acellular matrix ( OAM) scaffolds and human aortic smooth muscle cells ( hASMCs) or human adipose-derived stem cells ( hASCs). The second objective was to investigate the effect of hypoxic preconditioning of seeding cells on cell viability and migration depth. Our results demonstrated that hASMCs and hASCs could attach and adhere to the decellularized OAM scaffold and survive and proliferate for at least 7 days depending on the growth conditions. This indicates adipose-derived stem cells ( ASCs) have the potential to substitute for smooth muscle cells ( SMCs) in the construction of tissue engineered oesophageal muscle layers.
