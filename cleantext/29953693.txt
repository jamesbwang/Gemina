  To probe the inhibitory effects of deoxynivalenol ( DON) on growth and biofilms of yeast and bacterial pathogens. Crystal violet quantification , XTT reduction assay , confocal and scanning electron microscopic imaging , and yeast-to-hyphal inhibition assays were performed to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of DON. Our results show that DON and its modified form ( 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol) caused dose-dependent inhibition of Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> pathogenesis under in vitro conditions. DON significantly reduced C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> biofilm formation and metabolic activities , disrupted pre-formed biofilms without affecting planktonic cell growth , and inhibited hyphal protrusions in embedded colonies and free-living planktonic cells. We also show that DON and its derivatives function by interacting with lanosterol 14Î±-demethylase , thus mimicking the action mechanism of azole drugs. Highlighting the importance of C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> biofilms and hyphal filamentations in inducing pathogen vigor , this study demonstrates the anti-hyphal and anti-biofilm potential of DON against C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen>. Mycotoxin-producing molds are able to dominate and control other microbes and insects in ecological niches. At times , they are known to eradicate biofilms of their intruders or symbiotic partners. In view of this coincident notion , the study proposes a role for mycotoxins as a biofilm inhibitor in ecological niches. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
