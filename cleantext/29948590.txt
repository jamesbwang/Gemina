  The outcomes of stent implantation in managing May-Thurner syndrome<disease> ( MTS) are not well understood. To clarify the acute and long-term outcomes of stent implantation in patients with MTS having acute deep venous thrombosis ( DVT) , we retrospectively investigated consecutive 59 patients from 10 hospitals in Japan who were treated with stents for left iliac vein stenosis with acute DVT. Stents were considered successful if the stent was patent at discharge , which in turn was defined as patient success. The primary endpoint for the study was stent patency , and the secondary endpoint was recurrence of DVT and development of post-thrombotic syndrome<disease> ( PTS) during follow-up. The patient success was achieved in 56 patients ( 95 %). Clinical follow-up was conducted for 50 patients ( 89 %) for a median duration of 40 months ( range 8-165 months). Among them , 44 patients ( 79 %) were followed up using imaging modalities. During this period , stent occlusion was revealed in four patients ( 9 %) , and one patient was successfully treated using balloon angioplasty. Primary and secondary patency rates were 84 % at 19 months and 93 % at 20 months , respectively. Recurrence of DVT was documented in 3 ( 8 %) patients. PTS was evaluated from 36 patients. Three patients ( 8 %) had PTS; however , none of the patients had severe PTS. This multicenter retrospective study of the use of stents for treating patients with MTS having acute DVT demonstrated good acute and long-term outcomes and long-term stent patency.
