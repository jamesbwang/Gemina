  Platelet aggregation can be measured using optical aggregation ( light transmission aggregometry , LTA) as well as by impedance ( Multiplate analyzer). The LTA ( the gold standard method) can be influenced by many preanalytical variables. Several guidelines differ in recommendations for the duration patients should refrain from smoking , coffee , fatty meals , and physical exercise prior to blood collection for performing platelet function tests. In this pilot study , the influence of smoking , coffee , high-fat meal , or physical exercise on platelet aggregation was investigated to improve patient friendliness and laboratory logistics in platelet function diagnostics. Standardized blood collection was performed when participants were fasting and after each parameter ( n = 5 per group). As a control for diurnal fluctuations , participants ( n = 6) were fasting during both blood collections. Platelet aggregation was executed using standardized methods for LTA and Multiplate analyzer. Statistical analysis of the results using Wilcoxon signed-rank test did not show any significant differences in platelet aggregation in healthy participants under different preanalytical variables. Therefore , these variables are not expected to adversely affect testing , which can avoid canceling tests for those patients who inevitably did.
