  A rise in antimicrobial resistance demands novel alternatives to antimicrobials for disease control and prevention. As an important component of innate immunity , host defense peptides ( HDPs) are capable of killing a broad spectrum of pathogens and modulating a range of host immune responses. Enhancing the synthesis of endogenous HDPs has emerged as a novel host-directed antimicrobial therapeutic strategy. To facilitate the identification of natural products with a strong capacity to induce HDP synthesis , a stable macrophage cell line expressing a luciferase reporter gene driven by a 2-Kb avian Î²-defensin 9 (
