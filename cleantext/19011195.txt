  It is postulated that ILD causes PA dilatation independent of the presence of pulmonary hypertension ( PH) , so the use of PA size to screen for PH is not recommended. The aims of this study were to investigate the association of PA size with the presence and severity of ILD and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of PA size for detecting PH. Incident patients referred to a tertiary PH centre underwent baseline thoracic CT , MRI and right heart catheterisation ( RHC). Pulmonary artery diameter was measured on CT pulmonary angiography and pulmonary arterial areas on MRI. A thoracic radiologist scored the severity of ILD on CT from 0 to 4 , 0 = absent , 1 = 1-25 % , 2 = 26-50 % , 3 = 51-75 % , and 4 = 76-100 % extent of involvement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and linear regression were employed to assess diagnostic accuracy and independent associations of PA size. 110 had suspected PH due to ILD ( age 65 years ( SD 13) , M: F 37:73) and 379 had suspected PH without ILD ( age 64 years ( SD 13) , M: F 161:218). CT derived main PA diameter was accurate for detection of PH in patients both with and without ILD- AUC 0.873 , Pulmonary arterial pressure elevation leads to pulmonary arterial dilation , which is not independently influenced by the presence or severity of ILD measured by FVC , T
