  Neuropathic pain is a chronic and intractable pain , with very few effective analgesics. It involves an impaired cell autophagy process. Hydrogen-rich saline ( HRS) reportedly reduces allodynia and hyperalgesia in a neuropathic pain model; however , it is unknown whether these effects involve autophagy induction. We investigated the relationship between HRS and cell autophagy in a neuropathic pain model generated by chronic constriction injury ( CCI) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats received an intraperitoneal injection of HRS ( 10 mL/kg daily , from 1 day before until 14 days after CCI) , 3MA ( autophagy inhibitor) , 2ME2 ( HIF-1 CCI caused behavioral hypersensitivity<disease> to mechanical and thermal stimulation in the hind-paw of the injured side. HRS improved MWT and TWL , activated autophagy , and increased autophagosomes and autolysosomes in CCI rats. 3-MA aggravated hyperalgesia and allodynia and suppressed autophagy , while EDHB attenuated hyperalgesia and activated the autophagy procedure and the HIF-1 HRS reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and activation of cell autophagy in neuropathic pain through a HIF1-dependent pathway.
