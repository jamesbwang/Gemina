  BACKGROUND Tamiflu ( oseltamivir phosphate) serves as prophylaxis and treatment of upper respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( URTI) and lower respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( LRTI) caused by viruses of the Orthomyxovirus family. Here , we present a patient with URTI and negative rapid influenza<disease> diagnostic testing ( RIDT) , who developed rhabdomyolysis after being started on oseltamivir. CASE REPORT Our report describes a rare case of rhabdomyolysis after oseltamivir administration in a 53-year-old man with suspected influenza<disease> We discuss the differential diagnosis for rhabdomyolysis to rule out other causes and review the literature on influenza-induced rhabdomyolysis. CONCLUSIONS Considering the serious consequences of rhabdomyolysis , care needs to be taken in routine prescription and use of oseltamivir. Although this is a rare adverse effect , our case highlights the need to be vigilant for uncommon adverse events with commonly used drugs.
