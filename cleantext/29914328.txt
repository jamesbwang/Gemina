  The purpose of this research is to examine the core and nature of spiritual support services experienced by Turkey 's pioneer spiritual support specialists ( SSSs). A phenomenological approach was used in this qualitative research in which six males , two females , and eight SSSs participated. It has been seen that as a result of face-to-face interviews with participants within the framework of the semi-structured interview protocol , the spiritual support service has been experienced as a process which changes the perception of life. In participants ' experience , spiritual support has a deeper and more positive impact than other psychosocial services. Research findings show the need for a more dynamic education process based on psychology and social sciences to enhance effective communication and interviewing skills.
