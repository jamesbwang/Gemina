  The use of Î²-nitroenamines as a new class of acceptors in the enantioselective Pd-catalyzed trimethylenemethane cycloaddition afforded differentiated 1,2-dinitrogen bearing cyclopentanes with three contiguous stereocenters. The utility of these acceptors was demonstrated with the efficient construction of the core of jogyamycin and aminocyclopentitols. Further elaboration of the cycloadducts provided a concise synthetic approach toward joygamycin.
