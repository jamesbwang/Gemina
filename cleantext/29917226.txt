  Adalimumab is used to treat several inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> , including plaque psoriasis. GP2017 is a proposed adalimumab biosimilar. To assess the impact of multiple switches between GP2017 and reference adalimumab ( ref-ADMB) following the demonstration of equivalent efficacy and similar safety and immunogenicity , in adult patients with active , clinically stable , moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. This 51-week double-blinded , phase III study randomly assigned patients to GP2017 ( n = 231) or ref-ADMB ( n = 234) 80 mg subcutaneously at week 0 , then 40 mg biweekly from week 1. At week 17 , patients were rerandomized to switch ( n = 126) or continue ( n = 253) treatment. The primary end point was patients achieving ≥ 75 % improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI 75) at week 16 , with equivalence confirmed if the 95 % confidence interval ( CI) for the difference in PASI 75 between treatments was ± 18 %. The key secondary end point was the change from baseline to week 16 in continuous PASI. Other end points were PASI over time; PASI 50 , 75 , 90 and100; pharmacokinetics; safety; tolerability and immunogenicity for the switched and continued treatment groups. Equivalent efficacy between GP2017 and ref-ADMB was confirmed for the primary ( 66 · 8 % and 65 · 0 % , respectively; 95 % CI -7 · 46 to 11 · 15) and key secondary end points ( -60 · 7 % and -61 · 5 % , respectively; 95 % CI -3 · 15 to 4 · 84). PASI improved over time and was similar between treatment groups at week 16 , and the switched and continued groups from weeks 17 to 51. There were no relevant safety or immunogenicity differences between GP2017 and ref-ADMB at week 16 , or the switched and continued groups from weeks 17 to 51. No hypersensitivity<disease> to adalimumab was reported upon switching. Following the demonstration of GP2017 biosimilarity to ref-ADMB , switching up to four times between GP2017 and ref-ADMB had no detectable impact on efficacy , safety or immunogenicity.
