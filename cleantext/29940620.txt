  Endometrial cancer is one of the most common tumors in women worldwide. P53 has a well-known function as tumor suppressor , but it can also regulate the tissues metabolism , differentiation and development. Snail is a zinc-finger transcription factor , involved in the cell differentiation and survival. We analyzed the immunoexpression of p53 and Snail in 55 cases of endometrioid endometrial carcinoma ( EEC) , in relation with the histopathological prognosis parameters and tumoral compartments , respectively intratumoral and advancing edge areas. For both markers , we found a statistically significant association with histological grade , in relation with tumoral compartments. P53 and Snail can be used in developing EEC targeted treatment.
