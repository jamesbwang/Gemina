  Inspired by the `` brick-and-mortar '' structure and remarkable mechanical performance of nacre , many efforts have been devoted to fabricating nacre-mimicking materials. Herein , a class of graphene oxide ( GO) based artificial nacre material with quadruple hydrogen-bonding interactions was fabricated by functionalization of polydopamine-capped graphene oxide ( PDG) with 2-ureido-4 ( 1 H)- pyrimidinone ( UPy) self-complementary quadruple hydrogen-bonding units followed by supramolecular assembly process. The artificial nacre displays a strict `` brick-and-mortar '' structure , with PDG nanosheets as the brick and UPy units as the mortar. The resultant nanocomposite shows an excellent balance<symptom> of strength and toughness. Because of the strong strengthening via quadruple hydrogen bonding , the tensile strength and toughness can reach 325.6 ± 17.8 MPa and 11.1 ± 1.3 MJ m
