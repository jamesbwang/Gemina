  Controlled covalent functionalization of graphene remains a challenging task due to the heterogeneous nature of materials. Functionalization approaches of graphene either lack in quantifying the degree of functionalization or they do not discriminate between covalent and non-covalent functionalization. Here , graphite is oxidized and exfoliated in a three-step procedure and subsequently reduced and functionalized by hexylation. While Raman spectroscopy is powerful to determine the degree of in-plane lattice defects ( θLD) and functionalization ( θFD) , the method fails detecting introduced hexyl groups at a concentration of about 0.03 % , next to the pre-existing in-plane lattice defects of 0.7 %. However , sensitive thermogravimetric analysis coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry ( TGA-GC/MS) can prove the hexylation reaction. The efficiency of functionalization is comparable to reductive functionalization of pristine CVD-graphene and bulk graphite.
