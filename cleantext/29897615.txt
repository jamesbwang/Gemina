  Apple pomace has been considered as a sustainable source for antioxidant phenolic compounds. Previous reports show extraction of total phenolic contents ( TPC) by following various conventional and non-conventional techniques; however , a comparative study has not been reported. In the present work , conventional extraction was compared with several non-conventional extraction methods including ultrasound-assisted extraction ( UAE) , microwave-assisted extraction ( MAE) , high-speed homogenization ( HH). Moreover , efficacy of combined treatments , including high-speed homogenization coupled with MAE and ultrasound-assisted enzymatic extraction ( UAEE) was evaluated for the recovery of TPC. The results revealed that UAEE results in the highest TPC ( 4.62 mg GAE/g) , moreover , it simultaneously enabled the recovery of low methoxy pectins with the degree of methylation ranging from 14.03- 28.85 %. The LC-Q-Tof analysis revealed the presence of various phenolic acids and flavonoids. The DPPH radical scavenging assay showed that the phenolic rich extracts had IC50 values ranging from 27.1 to 54.6 , depending on the extraction parameters. This article is protected by copyright.
