  We sought to demonstrate that the combination of a local vasodilator ( verapamil) , modern materials , patent hemostasis , and intravenous anticoagulant only in the case of percutaneous coronary intervention , as compared to default heparin administration after sheath insertion , may optimize a combined endpoint , including radial artery oc-clusion ( RAO) , radial artery spasm ( RAS) , and access site complication. This is a prospective , single-center , double-blind randomized trial. Overall , 418 patients undergoing a transradial approach ( TRA) for coronary procedures were randomized 1: 1 to receive intraradial verapamil ( 5 mg) or heparin ( 5,000 IU) after a 6-Fr sheath insertion. The primary outcome was the 24-h occurrence of RAO ( ultrasound confirmation) , access site complication , and RAS requiring the bailout administration of vasodilators. The combined primary outcome occurred in 127 ( 30 %) patients. It was significantly lower in patients randomized to verapamil as compared to others ( 26 vs. 35 % , p = 0.03). This was mainly due to a significant reduction in RAS ( 3 vs. 10 % , p = 0.006). The 24-h and 30-day occurrence of RAO did not differ between the study groups. Local administration of verapamil versus heparin reduces RAS , without increasing RAO , which appears to be strictly related to radial artery diameter and hemostasis time.
