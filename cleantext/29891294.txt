  In order to reduce agglomerations and improve the compatibility of poly ( butylenes succinate)/ cellulose nanocrystals ( PBS/CNC) composite , phthalic anhydride was introduced during the preparation of composite via melt blending. The composites were then suffered by squeezing treatment in a two-roll milling equipment at a given temperature. In order to investigate reaction mechanism among PBS , CNC and phthalic anhydride , PBS/CNC composites were separated and then tested via FTIR and UV-vis spectrophotometer. During reactive blending , phthalic anhydride selectively reacts with CNC , at an effective grafting ratio of 0.0196 , which is confirmed by titration results. Before squeezing , the crystallinity of PBS in composites are increased but the mechanical properties of composites are weakened with increasing phthalic anhydride content , which is ascribed to the plasticizing effect of phthalic anhydride. After squeeze treatment at an extension ratio of 6 , the tensile strength of PBS/PA/CNC ( 100/2/3) is dramatically increased from 35.2 MPa to 136 MPa. WAXD results show that PBS crystal type has little change but the crystallinity is sharply increased after orientation , which mostly contributes to the improvement of mechanical properties for PBS/CNC composites.
