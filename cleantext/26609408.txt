  In this Letter , a method is proposed to investigate the effect of noise with and without active noise control ( ANC) on multichannel electroencephalogram ( EEG) signal. The multichannel EEG signal is recorded during different listening conditions such as silent , music , noise , ANC with background noise and ANC with both background noise and music. The multiscale analysis of EEG signal of each channel is performed using the discrete wavelet transform. The multivariate multiscale matrices are formulated based on the sub-band signals of each EEG channel. The singular value decomposition is applied to the multivariate matrices of multichannel EEG at significant scales. The singular value features at significant scales and the extreme learning machine classifier with three different activation functions are used for classification of multichannel EEG signal. The experimental results demonstrate that , for ANC with noise and ANC with noise and music classes , the proposed method has sensitivity values of 75.831 % (
