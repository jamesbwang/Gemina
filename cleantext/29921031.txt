  A 27-year-old female with Eisenmenger 's syndrome<disease> underwent closure of a patent ductus arteriosus , closure of a perimembranous ventricular septal defect and mid muscular defect and bilateral lung transplantation. Her immediate postoperative course was complicated by severe right ventricular outflow tract ( RVOT) obstruction resulting in hemodynamic collapse , a condition described as suicide right ventricle. The patient was placed on central Veno-Arterial Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation as a bridge to the relief of RVOT obstruction which included a right ventricular outflow muscle resection and a right ventricle outflow tract patch. The patient made an uneventful recovery.
