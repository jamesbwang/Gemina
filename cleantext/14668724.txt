  The transition of procedure coding from ICD-9-CM-Vol-3 to ICD-10-PCS has generated problems for the medical community at large resulting from the lack of clarity required to integrate two non-congruent coding systems. We hypothesized that quantifying these issues with network topology analyses offers a better understanding of the issues , and therefore we developed solutions ( online tools) to empower hospital administrators and researchers to address these challenges. Five topologies were identified: `` identity '' ( I) , `` class-to-subclass '' ( C2S) , `` subclass-toclass '' ( S2C) , `` convoluted ( C) '' , and `` no mapping '' ( NM). The procedure codes in the 2010 Illinois Medicaid dataset ( 3,290 patients , 116 institutions) were categorized as C = 55 % , C2S = 40 % , I = 3 % , NM = 2 % , and S2C = 1 %. Majority of the problematic and ambiguous mappings ( convoluted) pertained to operations in ophthalmology cardiology , urology , gyneco-obstetrics , and dermatology. Finally , the algorithms were expanded into a user-friendly tool to identify problematic topologies and specify lists of procedural codes utilized by medical professionals and researchers for mitigating error-prone translations , simplifying research , and improving quality.http:// www.lussiergroup.org/transition-to-ICD10PCS.
