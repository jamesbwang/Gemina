  We previously reported a novel danshensu derivative ( R)- ( 3,5,6-Trimethylpyrazinyl) methyl-2-acetoxy-3- ( 3,4-diacetoxyphenyl) propanoate ( ADTM) that exhibited promising cardiovascular protective activities , such as antioxidant and antiplatelet activities , as well as arterial relaxation. Particularly , ADTM treatment for 24 h exhibited anti-oxidative activity and effectively protected against acute myocardial infarction ( MI) in a rat model. Here , we further investigated the pharmacological actions of 14 days of treatment with ADTM in alleviating and restoring the MI size by stimulating revascularization. The pro-angiogenesis activity of ADTM has been validated in multiple experimental models including MI mouse , zebrafish , human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs) and A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs). In addition , the effect of ADTM on L-type Ca
