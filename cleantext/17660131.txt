  The prevalence of diverticular disease in the Western and industrialized nations has increased over the last century , and our understanding of this disease and its management continues to evolve. In this article , we review the literature regarding the postoperative quality of life ( QOL) and functional outcomes following surgical management of diverticulitis , including information regarding bowel function , recurrence of symptoms , and other postoperative sequelae. While objective parameters , such as attacks of diverticulitis , complications , and clinical episodes have been studied , there is a paucity of data on less objective factors , such as overall patient satisfaction after operative management of diverticular disease. The literature shows improvement in QOL following surgical intervention for diverticulitis if preoperative QOL was significantly low , secondary to severe/complicated diverticulitis. However , a subset of patients does continue to have symptoms following surgical intervention for diverticulitis. Often neglected in the literature , there remains a need for prospective data evaluating preoperative function to ascertain the impact of surgery on patients ' QOL and postoperative function.
