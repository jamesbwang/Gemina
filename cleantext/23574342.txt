  Basal cell carcinoma is the most frequent skin cancer , generally located in hair-bearing , sunlight-exposed areas. Basal cell carcinoma usually occurs on the head and neck , but very rarely on extra-facial locations. We report a case of a 65-year-old woman presenting with a solitary non-healing ulcer<disease> on the sole of the right foot for two years. Histopathological examination showed a typical nodular basal cell carcinoma , confirmed by positivity to Ber-EP4 on immunohistochemistry. There was no history of trauma , exposure to noxious agents , basal cell nevus syndrome<disease> , or xeroderma pigmentosum.
