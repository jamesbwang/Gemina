  Glaucoma drainage devices are mostly used for refractory glaucoma. Early postoperative complications include flat anterior chamber , choroidal effusion<symptom> , and suprachoroidal hemorrhage<symptom>. An 8-year-old male patient with a prior history of vitreous surgery for traumatic vitreous hemorrhage<symptom> , presented to us with angle recession glaucoma in his right eye. His intraocular pressure ( IOP) was 44 mmHg despite maximum antiglaucoma medication. Ahmed glaucoma valve ( AGV) surgery was performed to control his IOP. In the early postoperative period , the patient developed premacular subinternal limiting membrane ( ILM) hemorrhage<symptom> , which did not resolve even after 4 weeks. Vitreoretinal intervention involving removal of the thickened ILM and sub-ILM bleed had to be performed. To the best of our knowledge , no case has been reported with sub-ILM bleed post aqueous humor shunts. Here , we report a case of premacular sub-ILM bleed following AGV in vitrectomized eye.
