  In the recent years , the reported cases of mitochondrial disorders have reached a colossal number. These disorders spawn a sundry of pathological conditions , which lead to pernicious symptoms and even fatality. Due to the unpredictable etiologies , mitochondrial diseases are putatively referred to as `` mystondria '' ( mysterious diseases of mitochondria). Although present-day research has greatly improved our understanding of mitochondrial disorders , effective therapeutic interventions are still at the precursory stage. The conundrum becomes further complicated because these pathologies might occur due to either mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) mutations or due to mutations in the nuclear DNA ( nDNA) , or both. While correcting nDNA mutations by using gene therapy ( replacement of defective genes by delivering wild-type ( WT) ones into the host cell , or silencing a dominant mutant allele that is pathogenic) has emerged as a promising strategy to address some mitochondrial diseases , the complications in correcting the defects of mtDNA in order to renovate mitochondrial functions have remained a steep challenge. In this review , we focus specifically on the selective gene therapy strategies that have demonstrated prospects in targeting the pathological mutations in the mitochondrial genome , thereby treating mitochondrial ailments.
