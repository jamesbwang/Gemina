  The luminescence intensity of near-infrared ( NIR) emitting lanthanide nanoparticles ( LnNPs) is usually limited , owing to their small absorption cross section. Although dye sensitization has been proven to be an effective way to improve the luminescence intensity of LnNPs , the sensitization effect is fairly limited , owing to the simplicity of the sensitizers used and the complexity of the energy transfer process , typically involving three steps. In this study , a more efficient sensitizer ( Cy7) was chosen to replace a commonly used one ( ICG) and the energy transfer process was also optimized through using Yb3 + ions as emitter ions and Nd3 + ions as intermediate ions. With Cy7 as a sensitizer , the sensitization effect was assessed to be better than with ICG , owing to the higher quantum yield of Cy7. Meanwhile , the Cy7-sensitized NIR lanthanide nanomaterial was proven to be good for deep tissue penetration and low-power excitation bioimaging. Furthermore , the highly-enhanced NIR signal was successfully used in blood vessel imaging and fluorescence-guided peritumoral lymph node dissection in a mouse model.
