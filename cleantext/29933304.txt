  An important question revolves around when the most opportune time is to introduce recovery-optimizing behaviors for men opting for radical prostatectomy ( RP) for localized prostate cancer ( PCa). An emerging field of research describes the role of preoperative strategies to improve treatment tolerance and overall physical and psychological recovery. The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of a multimodal prehabilitation intervention for men and their partners before RP for localized PCa. Thirty-four patients who opted for RP for localized PCa and their partners ( 19) were identified and recruited into the study. The multimodal intervention was composed of educational materials , physiotherapy instruction , and a self-management group-based seminar. The multimodal prehabilitation intervention was perceived as overall helpful with demonstrated acceptability ( 91.9 %). Beneficial themes related to the quality of the information provided to support self-management , open forum questions with multidisciplinary healthcare professionals , and increased knowledge among partners to help with their understanding of how to look after their partners. The intervention was feasible and beneficial for the PCa dyad. A future pilot randomized controlled trial study is needed to provide sufficient evidence on the long-term physical and psychological outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Oncology nurses play a key role in the development of prehabilitation care delivery. Prehabilitation interventions can have a positive effect on improving health outcomes for cancer patients and their partners after surgery and into survivorship.
