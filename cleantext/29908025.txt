  In Turkey , varicella vaccine was introduced into routine childhood immunization in 2013 , with a single dose administered to children aged 12 months. However , there is limited information on the morbidity ( incidence and seroprevalence) , mortality and burden of disease of varicella in the overall Turkish population. To determine varicella seroprevalence and its social determinants in Manisa Province , Turkey in children aged > 2 years before single-dose varicella vaccination was introduced in 2013. The presence of anti varicella-zoster virus IgG antibodies was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum samples collected from 1250 participants. The overall seroprevalence was 92.8 % and the seroprevalence was > 90 % among all age groups except 2-9 years ( 55.7 %). Seroprevalence was significantly associated with family size , annual per capita equivalent income , number of people per room and education level. After adjusting by age , only education level remained significantly associated with seroprevalence , reflecting the early age effect. High seroprevalance depends on natural exposure to the infectious<disease> agent<disease> itself and is not associated with social determinants. High vaccine coverage should be maintained for effective varicella control and switching to a 2-dose schedule may also be considered to reduce the number and size of outbreaks in the Turkish population.
