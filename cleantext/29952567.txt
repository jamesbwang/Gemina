  The primary target of a novel series of immunosuppressive 7-piperazin-1-ylthiazolo ( 5,4- d) pyrimidin-5-amines was identified as the lipid kinase , PI4KIIIβ. Evaluation of the series highlighted their poor solubility and unwanted off-target activities. A medicinal chemistry strategy was put in place to optimize physicochemical properties within the series , while maintaining potency and improving selectivity over other lipid kinases. Compound 22 was initially identified and profiled in vivo , before further modifications led to the discovery of 44 ( UCB9608) , a vastly more soluble , selective compound with improved metabolic stability and excellent pharmacokinetic profile. A co-crystal structure of 44 with PI4KIIIβ was solved , confirming the binding mode of this class of inhibitor. The much-improved in vivo profile of 44 positions it as an ideal tool compound to further establish the link between PI4KIIIβ inhibition and prolonged allogeneic organ engraftment , and suppression of immune responses in vivo.
