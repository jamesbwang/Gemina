  Cervical spine injuries are frequent and often caused by a blunt trauma mechanism. They can have severe consequences , with a high mortality rate and a high rate of neurological lesions.Diagnosis is a three-step process: 1) risk assessment according to the history and clinical features , guided by a clinical decision rule such as the Canadian C-Spine rule; 2) imaging if needed; 3) classification of the injury according to different classification systems in the different regions of the cervical spine.The urgency of treatment is dependent on the presence of a neurological lesion<symptom> and/or instability. The treatment strategy depends on the morphological criteria as defined by the classification. Cite this article:
