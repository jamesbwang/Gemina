  People suffering from autism spectrum disorders ( ASD) provide atypical responses to sensorial stimulations , indicating specific sensory processing. These responses vary from one another and within the same individual with ASD , resulting in maladaptive functional capacities in everyday life. Factors explaining those specificities are poorly defined and need to be better identified. To examine the relationship between sensory modulation symptoms ( SMSs) and maladaptive behaviors in a group of children with ASD. To study how the sensory processing patterns in ASD are related to chronological age , intensity of autistic symptoms , and associated intellectual disability. A transversal observational study of a group of children with ASD was conducted for 1 year in an Autism Resource Centre in Marseille , France. The SMSs were assessed using the Dunn short sensory profile. The adaptive behaviors and social quotient were assessed using the Vineland adaptive behavior scale. Forty-five children with ASD completed both scales. Significant correlations were found between SMS intensity and the children 's adaptive behaviors. Furthermore , chronological age and intellectual disability showed a significant relationship with SMS intensity; chronological age and intellectual disability were also found to be significantly related. However , the severity of autistic symptoms was not associated with the intensity of SMSs. These outcomes give a better understanding of sensory processing in ASD. The analysis of sensory processing is valuable during the diagnostic phase and for the development of individualized/custom-tailored interventions.
