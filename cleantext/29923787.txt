  To map the different personal positions of Guinean people regarding vaccination against Ebola<disease>. From January to April 2016 , 304 adults in Guinea were presented with 48 vignettes depicting situations in which getting vaccinated would be possible. These situations varied as a function of the constructs of health-protective behavior theories. The participants indicated the likelihood they would get vaccinated in each case. Seven qualitatively different positions were found: Always Vaccinate ( 38 %) , Never Vaccinate ( 25 %) , Hesitant ( 19 %) , Depends on Cost Only ( 7 %) , Depends on Neighbors ' Attitude and Cost ( 5 %) , Mainly Depends on Risk ( 4 %) , and Mistrust of Cheap Vaccines ( 2 %). The diversity of Guinean people 's positions implies that Ebola<disease> vaccination campaigns in Guinea , and probably in other sub-Saharan African countries , must not be `` one size fits all , '' but must be multifaceted and tailored in design and implementation to match the diversity of these people 's needs and views.
