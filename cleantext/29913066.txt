  The interphase between fiber and matrix plays an essential role in the performance of composites. Therefore , the ability to design or modify the interphase is a key technology needed to manufacture stronger and smarter composite. Recently , depositing nanomaterials onto the surface of the fiber has become a promising approach to optimize the interphase and composites. But , the modified composites have not reached the highest strength yet , because the determining parameters , such as thickness of the nanolayer , are hardly controlled by the mentioned methods in reported works. Here , we deposit conformal ZnO nanolayer with various thicknesses onto the surfaces of glass fibers via the atomic layer deposition ( ALD) method and a tremendous enhancement of interfacial shear strength of composites is achieved. Importantly , a critical thickness of ZnO nanolayer is obtained for the first time , giving rise to a maximal relative enhancement in the interfacial strength , which is more than 200 % of the control fiber. In addition , the single modified fiber exhibits a potential application as a flexible , transparent , in situ UV detector in composites. And , we find the UV-sensitivity also shows a strong correlation with the thickness of ZnO. To reveal the dependence of UV-sensitivity on thickness , a depletion thickness is estimated by a proposed model which is an essential guide to design the detectors with higher sensitivity. Consequently , such precise tailoring of the interphase offers an advanced way to improve and to flexibly control various macroscopic properties of multifunctional composites of the next generation.
