  Celiac disease ( CD) is common yet under-detected. A point of care test ( POCT) may improve CD detection. We aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of an IgA/IgG-deamidated gliadin peptide ( DGP)- based POCT for CD detection , patient acceptability , and inter-observer variability of the POCT results. From 2013-2017 , we prospectively recruited patients referred to secondary care with gastrointestinal symptoms , anemia<symptom> and/or weight<symptom> loss<symptom> ( group 1); and patients with self-reported gluten sensitivity with unknown CD status ( group 2). All patients had concurrent POCT , IgA-tissue transglutaminase ( IgA-TTG) , IgA-endomysial antibodies ( IgA-EMA) , total IgA levels , and duodenal biopsies. Five hundred patients completed acceptability questionnaires , and inter-observer variability of the POCT results was compared among five clinical staff for 400 cases. Group 1: 1000 patients , 58.5 % female , age 16-91 , median age 57. Forty-one patients ( 4.1 %) were diagnosed with CD. The sensitivities of the POCT , IgA-TTG , and IgA-EMA were 82.9 , 78.1 , and 70.7 %; the specificities were 85.4 , 96.3 , and 99.8 %. Group 2: 61 patients , 83 % female; age 17-73 , median age 35. The POCT had 100 % sensitivity and negative predictive value in detecting CD in group 2. Most patients preferred the POCT to venepuncture ( 90.4 % vs. 2.8 %). There was good inter-observer agreement on the POCT results with a Fleiss Kappa coefficient of 0.895. The POCT had comparable sensitivities to serology , and correctly identified all CD cases in a gluten sensitive cohort. However , its low specificity may increase unnecessary investigations. Despite its advantage of convenience and rapid results , it may not add significant value to case finding in an office-based setting.
