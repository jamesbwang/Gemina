  To investigate the effects of 4-week moderate aerobic exercise plus diet control on serum levels of total insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1) and IGF-1 binding protein-3 ( IGFBP-3) as well as IGF-1 activity ( reflected by molar ratio of IGF-1/ IGFBP-3) in female obese adolescents and youths , and their possible role on fat loss , and improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism. Nine female obese youths ( age: 18 ~ 19 y) and 30 female obese adolescents ( age: 14 ~ 16 y) were recruited and undertook 4-week aerobic exercise such as swimming and jogging ( 6 days/week , twice a day , 2 h/time with 5 min rest per 30 min exercise) with gradual increase of intensity from low ( heart rate immediately post-exercise of 1st week: 100 ~ 120 beats/min) to moderate ( heart rate immediately post-exercise of 2 ① Compared with normal control , the serum levels of total IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were decreased in the female obese youths and adolescents , and IGF-1 activity was reduced only in the obese female adolescents. ② The serum level of IGFBP-3 was down-regulated and IGF-1 activity was up-regulated while no change of serum total IGF-1 was induced by 4-week moderate aerobic exercise plus diet control , accompanied with significant decreases of body<symptom> weight , BMI and waist circumference as well as improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism in the female obese youths and adolescents. Except for a positive association between the increased IGF-1 activity and the decreased waist circumference was found in the female obese youths by Pearson 's correlation analysis , there was no relation of the decreased IGFBP-3 , the increased IGF-1 activity with the improvements of anthropometric index and glucose and lipid metabolism in female obese youths and adolescents. The serum level of IGFBP-3 was down-regulated and the IGF-1 activity was up-regulated by 4-week moderate aerobic exercise plus diet control in female obese youths and adolescents. The increase of IGF-1 activity might be associated with the exercise-plus-diet-induced decrease of waist circumstance in female obese youths.
