  The intrinsic magnetism of MoS2 has been extensively investigated via simulations , but few reliable experimental results have been explored. Herein , we develop zigzag-edge rich layered structural MoS2 pyramids via chemical vapor deposition , triggering exceptional ferromagnetism. The magnetic measurements revealed the robust ferromagnetism of MoS2 pyramids compared with MoS2 flakes. The existence of ferromagnetism was mostly attributed to the presence of abundant zigzag-edges in the layered pyramids , confirmed by transmission electron microscopy , vibrating sample magnetometry , and magnetic force microscopy. Moreover , a clearly identified remnant and switchable magnetic moment was revealed for the first time in the MoS2 pyramid. This study provides sound evidence with the zigzag-edge induced ferromagnetism of the MoS2 materials , promising potential magnetic and spintronic applications.
