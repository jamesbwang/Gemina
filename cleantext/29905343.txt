  Fabricating complex nano-networks on solid substrates is a research area that has attracted much attention in the field of molecular self-assembly. By designing a fluorenone derivative of 2-heptyloxy-7-pentadecyloxy-9-fluorenone ( HPF) , we obtained a surface-confined system that presented diverse nanostructures. The assembled networks for HPF were highly dependent on the solvent and concentration. At the liquid/solid interface , chiral tetramer-S , hexamer-S , and tetramer-linear structures as well as achiral irregular-linear and random structures were recorded. On the dry surface , we observed chiral octamer-S and achiral alternate configurations. During the self-assembly process , the short and long alkyl chains of HPF showed selective identification , which contributed to the formation of S-like or anti-S-like tetramers , hexamers and octamers , resulting in chiral structures. The nanopatterns were stabilized under the driving forces of dipolar interactions , hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. Moreover , we performed forcefield calculations in order to further understand the underlying mechanisms from the viewpoints of their force strengths and binding energies. In general , the present work provides a significant impetus to induce polymorphous structures , and we believe that it will promote the study of chirality and achirality in the field of molecular self-assembly.
