  Lightning mapping technology has proven instrumental in understanding lightning. In this work we present a pipeline that can use lightning observed by the LOw-Frequency ARray ( LOFAR) radio telescope to construct a 3-D map of the flash. We show that LOFAR has unparalleled precision , on the order of meters , even for lightning flashes that are over 20 km outside the area enclosed by LOFAR antennas ( âˆ¼ 3,200 km
