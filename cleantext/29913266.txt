  Given their involvement in catalysis , infection , and biofilm formation , Fe and Mn are essential for bacterial survival and virulence. In this study , we found that Streptococcus<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen>) could grow in the Mn-deficient medium ( MDCM). Furthermore , findings showed that the Fe concentration in the bacterium<pathogen> increased when the Mn concentration decreased. In addition , it was noted that supplementing MDCM with Fe resulted in the recovery of bacterial growth. Quantitative proteomics using stable-isotope dimethyl labeling was performed to investigate the adaptive growth mechanism of S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> under Mn-deficient conditions. It was found that the expression levels of 25 proteins were downregulated , whereas those of 54 proteins were upregulated in S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> grown in MDCM. It was also noted that several of the downregulated proteins were involved in cell energy metabolism , amino acid synthesis , and reduction of oxidation products. More importantly , several ATP-binding cassette transporters related to Fe uptake , such as PiuA , PiaA , PitA , and SPD_1609 , were overexpressed for increased Fe uptake from the MDCM. The results suggest that Mn deficiency disturbs multiple metabolic processes in S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen>. Furthermore , it causes a compensatory effect of Fe for Mn , which is beneficial for the survival of the bacterium<pathogen> in extreme environments. The relationship between manganese and iron metabolism in S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> has not been clearly revealed. In this paper , we suggest that Mn limitation disturbs multiple metabolic processes and evidently decreases the ATP level in the bacterium<pathogen>. In order to survive in this extreme environment , bacteria upregulated three type of Fe ion transporters PiuABC ( heme) , PiaABC ( ferrichrome) and PitABC ( Fe
