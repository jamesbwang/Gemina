  To have a knowledge of prevalent red blood cell folate concentration in Beijing and analyzes optimum time and dose of folic acid supplement. To provide the basis data for making public health policy and clinical consultation. This study included 3458 pregnant women who visited nutrition outpatient of the Haidian Maternal and Child Health Hospital in Beijing in first trimester. Their last menstrual period is between 1st Feb 2014 and 31 st Jan 2016. Using the method of cross sectional study to collect their demographic information , folic acid supplementation , clinical information and venous blood samples. Competitive binding receptor assay was used for detecting the red blood cell folate concentration. The mean of red blood cell folate concentration was ( 806. 5 ± 273. 7) ng/mL. The red blood cell folate concentration differences between age groups were significant ( P < 0. 001). Women with graduate and above had higher red blood cell folate concentration than others ( P = 0. 030). Women whose family income > 10000 had higher red blood cell folate concentration than other groups ( P < 0. 001). Red blood cell folate concentration in summer and autumn higherthan other season ( P < 0. 001). Red blood cell folate concentration level increased with folic acid supplementation dose and time. 84. 3 % the pregnant women reached 1180nmol/L ( 521 ng/mL) and 90. 0 % could reach the reference if used 400 μg folic acid supplemented for 16 weeks or ≥ 600 μg more than 8 weeks. Age , education level and family income are associated with red blood cell folate concentration. Depending on red blood cell folate concentration to advise the time and dose of folic acid supplementation.
