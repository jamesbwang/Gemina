  The metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) is a term used to describe the constellation of cardiometabolic risk factors including central adiposity , dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and arterial hypertension. Notably , a number of studies have shown high rates of testosterone ( T) deficiency in men with MetS and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM). Both hypogonadism and MetS confer increased health risk for morbidity and mortality as men with the MetS are at twice the risk for developing cardiovascular disease and at 5-fold higher risk for developing T2DM. Moreover , the inverse relationship between T and MetS is consistently observed across racial and ethnic groups. Thus , in the setting of growing obesity rates , this relationship between the reproductive endocrine axis and metabolism warrants renewed attention. This review specifically focuses on central hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism ( CH) providing a concise overview of the metabolic implications of CH and identify the unanswered questions and future directions in this growing field.
