  The Maternal , Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting ( MIECHV) Program is a two-generation approach to supporting healthy families through home visits during pregnancy and early childhood. All states and territories receiving MIECHV funding are encouraged to evaluate their programs. This special issue highlights evaluations from 11 awardees-Arkansas , Florida , Illinois , Iowa , Maryland , Massachusetts , Michigan , New Jersey , Oregon , Pennsylvania , and Tennessee. With the wide expansion of home visiting since the onset of MIECHV , the state-led evaluations contribute to the understanding of replication and scale-up of evidence-based home visiting.
