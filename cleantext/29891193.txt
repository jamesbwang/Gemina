  Mycoplasma<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> ( M.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen>) , as an obligate parasite , has evolved a protective strategy for coping with oxidative challenges caused by M.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> itself as well as the host immune system. However , to date , few antioxidant enzymes have been identified in mycoplasmas. In this report , we identified a protein encoded by the mpn668 gene from M.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> with a putative function as an organic hydroperoxide reductase ( Ohr). The results indicated that the recombinant 140 amino acid protein , designated rMPN668 , displayed hydroperoxidase activity towards both organic ( tert-butyl hydroperoxide) and inorganic ( hydrogen peroxide) hydroperoxides in the presence of a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol. Moreover , the expression of mpn668 in M.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> is upregulated in response to oxidative stress. Additionally , homology modeling of MPN668 and a molecular dynamics simulation suggest that both Cys55 and Cys119 form part of the active site of the protein. Mutants in which Cys55 or Cys119 were replaced with a serine lack antioxidant activity , indicating that MPN668 is a Cys-based peroxidase , consistent with it representing a new member of the Ohr family.
