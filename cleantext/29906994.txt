  Fluid motions in the inertial range of isotropic turbulence are fractal , with their space-filling capacity slightly below regular three-dimensional objects , which is a consequence of the energy cascade. Besides the energy cascade , the other often encountered cascading process is the momentum cascade in wall-bounded flows. Despite the long-existing analogy between the two processes , many of the thoroughly investigated aspects of the energy cascade have so far received little attention in studies of the momentum counterpart , e.g. , the possibility of the momentum-transferring scales in the logarithmic region being fractal has not been considered. In this work , this possibility is pursued , and we discuss one of its implications. Following the same dimensional arguments that lead to the D = 2.33 fractal dimension of wrinkled surfaces in isotropic turbulence , we show that the large-scale momentum-carrying eddies may also be fractal and non-space-filling , which then leads to the power-law scaling of the mean velocity profile. The logarithmic law of the wall , on the other hand , corresponds to space-filling eddies , as suggested by Townsend ( The Structure of Turbulent Shear Flow ( Cambridge University Press , Cambridge , 1980)). Because the space-filling capacity is an integral geometric quantity , the analysis presented in this work provides us with a low-order quantity , with which , one would be able to distinguish between the logarithmic law and the power law.
