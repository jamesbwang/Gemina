  Patients with diabetic nephropathy ( DN) may benefit from vitamin E 's antilipid and antioxidant activities. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of high-dose vitamin E supplementation on markers of cardiometabolic risk and oxidative stress in patients with DN. This randomized controlled trial was carried out on 54 patients with DN that were randomly divided into 2 groups to receive vitamin E supplement ( 800 IU/d) or placebo for 12 weeks. Fasting blood samples were obtained at baseline and after the 12-week intervention to determine markers of cardiometabolic risk and oxidative stress. Vitamin E supplementation , compared with the placebo , resulted in a significant reduction in serum total cholesterol ( -14.3 ± 29.9 mg/dL versus -0.8 ± 13.1 mg/L , P = .03) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( -16.4 ± 28.5 mg/dL versus 0.1 ± 17.2 mg/L , P = .01) , and ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio ( -0.5 ± 0.7 versus 0.1 ± 0.5 , P = .001) , and a significant elevation in vitamin E levels ( 39.7 ± 12.4 nmol/mL versus -0.5 ± 1.3 nmol/mL , P < .001) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ( 1.4 ± 3.7 versus -2.1 ± 5.1 mg/L , P = .006). It also resulted in a significant elevation in plasma glutathione levels. Our study demonstrated that high-dose vitamin E supplementation for 12 weeks had favorable effects on lipid profile and glutathione levels of patients with DN , except for triglycerides , very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , nitric oxide , and total antioxidant capacity levels.
