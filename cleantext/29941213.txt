  Cenderitide is a novel designer natriuretic peptide ( NP) composed of C-type natriuretic peptide ( CNP) fused to the C-terminus of Dendroaspis natriuretic peptide ( DNP). Cenderitide was engineered to co-activate the two NP receptors , particulate guanylyl cyclase ( pGC)- A and pGC-B. The rationale for its design was to achieve the renal-enhancing and anti-fibrotic properties of dual receptor activation , but without clinically significant hypotension<symptom>. Here , we review the biology of the NPs and the rationale for their use in heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Most importantly , we present the key studies related to the discovery of Cenderitide. Finally , we review the key clinical studies that have advanced this first-in-class dual NP receptor activator for
