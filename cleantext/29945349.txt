  Peripheral blood absolute monocyte count ( AMC) and lymphocyte<symptom> to monocyte ratio ( LMR) have strong prognostic value in various forms of lymphomas. It was found that higher AMC and lower LMR were associated with poor prognosis in B cell lymphoma. However , their prognostic significance in systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( sALCL) remained to be determined. This study was aimed at investigating the prognostic significance of AMC and LMR in sALCL. A total of 29 newly diagnosed patients with sALCL were retrospectively included in study , prognostic significance of AMC , LMR , performance status ( PS) , international prognostic index ( IPI) , prognostic index for T-cell lymphomas ( PIT) and other indicators were analyzed. Univariate analysis showed high AMC , LMR < 2.5 , PS ⩾ 2 , extranodal involvement , no response to treatment and B symptoms predicted inferior PFS; LMR < 2.5 , no response to treatment , elevated LDH , IPI ⩾ 3 , PIT ⩾ 2 and PS ⩾ 2 predicted inferior OS. High AMC , PS ⩾ 2 were independent prognostic factors for PFS; PS ⩾ 2 , no response to treatment and elevated LDH were independent prognostic factors for OS. AMC was an independent prognostic factor for PFS in sALCL , and LMR < 2.5 also indicated poor prognosis.
