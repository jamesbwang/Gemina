  Milk has been used as a vehicle for the delivery of antimalarial drugs during clinical trials to test for a food effect and artefenomel ( OZ439) showed enhanced oral bioavailability with milk. However , the nature of the interaction between milk and OZ439 in the gastrointestinal tract remains poorly understood. To understand the role of milk digestion on the solubilization of OZ439 and polymorphism , we conducted real-time monitoring of crystalline drug in suspension during in vitro intestinal lipolysis of milk containing OZ439 using synchrotron X-ray scattering. OZ439 formed an unstable solid-state intermediate free base form ( OZ439-FB form 1) at intestinal pH and was partially solubilized by milk fat globules prior to lipolysis. Dissolution of the free base form 1 and recrystallization of OZ439 in a more stable polymorphic form ( OZ439-FB form 2) occurred during in vitro lipolysis in milk. Simply stirring the milk/drug suspension in the absence of lipase or addition of lipase to OZ439 in a lipid-free buffer did not induce this polymorphic transformation. The formation of OZ439-FB form 2 was therefore accelerated by the solubilization of OZ439-FB form 1 during the digestion of milk. Our findings confirmed that although crystalline precipitates of OZ439-FB form 2 could still be detected after in vitro digestion , milk-based lipid formulations provided a significant reduction in crystalline OZ439 compared to lipid-free formulations , which we attribute to the formation of colloidal structures by the digested milk lipids. Milk may therefore be particularly suited as a form of lipid-based formulation ( LBF) for coadministration with OZ439 , from which both an enhancement in OZ439 oral bioavailability and the delivery of essential nutrients should result.
