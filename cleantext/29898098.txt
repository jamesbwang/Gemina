  Interpretation of sea-level indicators is essential when studying paleo sea-level fluctuations during the Holocene. Sea-level indicators may have different origins , such as geological ( beachrocks) and biological ( vermetids and barnacles). In order to reconstruct paleo sea-level , it is necessary to attribute an indicative meaning to each sea-level indicator. This paper aims to discuss issues raised by Angulo et al. ( 2016) regarding to the sea-level fluctuations curve proposed by Castro et al. ( 2014) to the Rio de Janeiro State coast , Brazilian southeast. The key issue that deserves posing is that local or regional curves can not be built based on large scale ( global) RSL geophysical models even in places of steady crust like Brazil. Here , we put into question the relative sea-level fluctuation curve model proposed by Angulo et al. ( 2006 , 2016) to the coast of Rio de Janeiro State and Pernambuco State. It is strengthened the proposal of using different origins indicators on RSL vertical variation , georeferenced by high precision altitude GPS , adjusted by Brazilian Geodetic System benchmarks , maintained by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE. All issues regarding the curve drawn by Castro et al. ( 2014) are answered based on field data , laboratory analytical techniques , radiocarbon dating as well as relevant literature.
