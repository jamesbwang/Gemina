  Neurotrophins and their receptors might regulate cell survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC). mRNA expression of nerve growth factor ( NGF) and protein synthesis of high ( NTRK1) and low affinity neurotrophin ( p75 neurotrophin receptor; NTR) receptors were investigated in normal oral mucosa and in HNSCC. HNSCC cell lines were treated with mitomycin C ( MMC) and cell survival was investigated. Normal and malignant epithelial cells expressed NGF mRNA. NTRK1 was upregulated in 80 % of HNSCC tissue , and 50 % of HNSCC samples were p75NTR positive. Interestingly , in HNSCC tissue: NTRK1 and p75NTR immunohistochemical reactions were mutually exclusive. Detroit 562 cell line contained only p75NTR , UPCI-SCC090 cells synthesized NTRK1 but not p75NTR and SCC-25 culture had p75NTR and NTRK1 in different cells. NGF ( 100 ng/mL) significantly improved ( 1.4-fold) the survival of cultured UPCI-SCC090 cells after MMC-induced cell cycle arrest , while Detroit 562 cells with high levels of p75NTR did not even get arrested by single short MMC treatment. p75NTR in HNSCC might be related with NGF-independent therapy resistance , while NTRK1 might transduce a survival signal of NGF and contribute in this way to improved tumor cell survival after cell cycle arrest.
