  To describe what motivates cancer patients , treated at a private cancer care centre in Port Elizabeth , South Africa , to undergo palliative chemotherapy and how the patients and their families experienced this treatment. A descriptive qualitative design was used. Researchers conducted 22 in-depth interviews with 11 purposively selected patients and 11 family members nominated by the patients. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data. The patient participants consisted of two males and nine females between the ages 40 and 79 , who had been diagnosed with various cancers. The family members consisted of six husbands , two wives and three sons , with ages ranging from 20 to 79. Three themes arose from the patient data and three from the family data. Hope informed the palliative treatment decision. Despite being told that the chemotherapy would not cure them , patients hoped for additional time and even a cure. The families supported the patient 's decision and shared their hopes. The family members were aware of the side effects their loved ones were experiencing , but still experienced the treatment as positive. Giving and receiving support was important and religion , the families and staff and fellow patients at the cancer care centre were identified as sources of support.
