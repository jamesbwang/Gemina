  The Baveno VI Consensus recommends repeating examination in patients with high liver stiffness measurement ( LSM) by transient elastography to reduce false-positive diagnosis of advanced liver disease. We tested whether repeating transient elastography can increase the overall diagnostic accuracy. Ninety-seven patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease who underwent two FibroScan examinations within 6 months prior to liver biopsy were evaluated. An LSM cut-off of 7.9 kPa was used to exclude F3-4 fibrosis<disease>. Seventy-eight patients had high LSM at baseline , among whom 27 had low LSM on repeated testing; only four had F3 and none had cirrhosis. In contrast , 31 of 51 patients with high LSM at both examinations had F3-4. Nineteen patients had low LSM at baseline; none of them had F3-4 regardless of the second LSM results. If we took LSM < 7.9 kPa at either examination as sufficient to exclude F3-4 , the negative predictive value remained high at 91 %. The positive predictive value for F3-4 increased from 45 % in patients with high LSM at baseline to 61 % in those with high LSM at both examinations. Sensitivity analysis using different cut-offs yielded similar results , with 76 % of patients with LSM > 12 kPa at both examinations having F3-4. Transient elastography is a highly sensitive screening test to exclude F3-4 fibrosis<disease> in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients. One-third of patients with high LSM may have normal results on repeated examination. By repeating examination in cases with high LSM , one may spare patients from unnecessary liver biopsy.
