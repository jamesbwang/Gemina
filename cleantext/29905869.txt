  The process of transforming a medical student to a competent neurosurgeon is becoming increasingly scrutinized and formalized. However , there are few data on resident workload.We sought to quantify the workload and educational experience of a junior resident while `` on-call. `` A single resident 's on-call log was reviewed from the period of July 1 , 2014 to June 30 , 2016 , corresponding to that resident 's postgraduate years 2 and 3. For each patient encounter ( ie , consult or admission) , information pertaining to the patient 's demographics , disease or reason for consult , date/time/location of consult , and need for any neurosurgical intervention within the first 24 hours was collected.In total , 1929 patients were seen in consultation. The majority of patients were male ( 62 %) with a median age of 50 years ( range , day of life 0-102 years) and had traumatic diagnoses ( 52 %). The number of consults received during the 16:00 to 17:00 and 17:00 to 18:00 hours was +1.6 and +2.5 standard deviations above the mean , respectively. The busiest and slowest months were May and January , respectively. Neurosurgical intervention performed within the first 24 hours of consultation occurred in 330 ( 17.1 %) patients: 221 ( 11.4 %) major operations , 69 ( 3.6 %) external ventricular drains , and 40 ( 2.1 %) intracranial pressure monitors.This is the first study to quantify the workload and educational experience of a typical neurosurgical junior resident while `` on-call '' ( ie , carrying the pager) for 2 consecutive years. It is our hope that these findings are considered by neurosurgical educators when refining resident education.
