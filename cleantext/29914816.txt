  The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors associated to recurrent diabetic foot ulcers<disease> after implementing a new preventive comprehensive foot care ( CFC) program carried out by a podiatrist and an endocrinologist at a multidisciplinary diabetic foot unit ( MDFU) and its potential impact in decreasing recurrent ulcers<disease>. A retrospective cohort study including consecutive patients who attended the MDFU for the first time from 2008 to 2014 complaining of a diabetic foot ulcer<disease> that finally healed. Patients were monitored until ulcer<disease> recurred or up to June 30 , 2016. Maximum follow-up time was 8.1 years. Cumulative incidence of recurrent ulcers<disease> was analyzed during two periods: 2008-2010 ( before CFC was implemented) and 2011-2014 ( after implementation of CFC). A total of 280 subjects with a median age of 69.5 years ( Q25: 60,2-Q75: 78) were included. Of these , 64.6 % were males and 92.1 % had type 2 diabetes mellitus. One hundred and twenty-six ( 45 %) suffered recurrent ulcers<disease>. Median time to recurrent ulceration was 0.97 ( Q25: 0.44-Q75: 1.74) years. Multivariate analysis showed sensory neuropathy ( HR ( 95 % CI) 1.58 ( 0.99-2.54) , P = .050); minor amputation ( HR ( 95 % CI) 1.66 ( 0.12-2 , 46) , P = .011); and 2011-2014 period versus 2008-10 period ( HR ( 95 % CI) 0.60 ( 0.42-0.87) , P = .007) to be factors independently associated to recurrent ulcers<disease>. Sensory neuropathy , minor amputation , and implementation of the CFC program were predictors of reulceration. Implementation of the CFC program was associated to a 40 % reduction in reulceration. Prevention of recurrent ulcers<disease> is feasible and should be a priority in a MDFU.
