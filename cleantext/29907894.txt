  Bifascicular block and prolonged PR interval on the electrocardiogram ( ECG) have been associated with complete heart block and sudden cardiac death. We sought to determine if cardiac implantable electronic devices ( CIED) improve survival in these patients. We assessed survival in relation to CIED status among 636 consecutive patients with bifascicular block and prolonged PR interval on the ECG. In survival analyses , CIED was considered as a time-varying covariate. Average age was 76 ± 9 years , and 99 % of the patients were men. A total of 167 ( 26 %) underwent CIED ( 127 pacemaker only) implantation at baseline ( n = 23) or during follow-up ( n = 144). During 5.4 ± 3.8 years of follow-up , 83 ( 13 %) patients developed complete or high-degree atrioventricular block and 375 ( 59 %) died. Patients with a CIED had a longer survival compared to those without a CIED in the traditional , static analysis ( log-rank p < 0.0001) but not when CIED was considered as a time-varying covariate ( log-rank p = 0.76). In the multivariable model , patients with a CIED had a 34 % lower risk of death ( hazard ratio 0.66 , 95 % confidence interval 0.52-0.83; p = 0.001) than those without CIED in the traditional analysis but not in the time-varying covariate analysis ( hazard ratio 1.05 , 95 % confidence interval 0.79-1.38; p = 0.76). Results did not change in the subgroup with a pacemaker only. Bifascicular block and prolonged PR interval on ECG are associated with a high incidence of complete atrioventricular block and mortality. However , CIED implantation does not have a significant influence on survival when time-varying nature of CIED implantation is considered.
