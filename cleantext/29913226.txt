  Patients suffering anorexia<symptom> nervosa ( AN) become anhedonic , in other words , unable or unwilling to derive normal pleasures and avoid rewarding outcomes , most profoundly in food intake. The neurobiological underpinnings of anhedonia are likely to involve mesolimbic reward circuitry. We propose here that this circuitry and its involvement in AN can be investigated using the activity-based anorexia<symptom> ( ABA) rodent model that recapitulates many of the characteristics of the human condition , most notably rapid<symptom> weight<symptom> loss<symptom>. Preference for sweetened water was used to assay hedonic processing in female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to the ABA protocol , which involves free access to running wheels paired with time-limited access to food. This protocol uncovered a transient anhedonia in only one quarter of cases; however , exposure to running wheels alone was associated with a rapid aversion to sweetened water ( F
