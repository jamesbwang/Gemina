  Microhydrangeas with a high ratio of low valence manganese oxide ( HRLV-MOMs) with MnO , Mn2O3 and γ-MnO2 percentages of 49.2 % , 32.3 % and 18.5 % , respectively , are synthesized in a one-step hydrothermal stirring method and allow extremely fast catalytic degradation of organic dyes due to the substantial number of directly produced hydroxyl ( ˙OH) and superoxide anion ( O2˙-) radicals.
