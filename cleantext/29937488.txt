  The causes of delamination and porosities during press forming of pre-consolidated flat laminates ( blanks) made of carbon fiber-reinforced poly ( ether ketone ketone) ( PEKK) were addressed in this study. In particular , the quality of the blank laminate was investigated before and after infrared heating. The consolidation quality was evaluated by thickness measurements , non-destructive inspection ( NDI) , and optical microscopy. The experimental results confirmed that deconsolidation phenomena can be related to residual stresses formed during blank forming in an autoclave , then released during infrared heating ( IR) of the blank , determining most of the defects in IR heated blanks. These defects , generated at the pre-heating stage , were not fully removed in the consolidation stage of the press forming process. An annealing treatment , performed on autoclave-consolidated blanks above the glass transition temperature of the matrix , was proposed to reduce the formation of defects during IR heating. The stress relaxation phenomena during annealing were modelled using a simple viscoelastic model.
