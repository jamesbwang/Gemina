  When Illinois expanded Medicaid in 2014 , the state also passed legislation requiring that 50 % of Medicaid recipients be enrolled in a managed care plan. The purpose of this project was to identify the barriers and facilitators that Medicaid enrollees have understanding and using their managed care plans. In this descriptive study , participants included Medicaid enrollees , community workers , health care navigators , and a state health insurance representative. Methods included focus groups , interviews , and surveys. The challenges that Medicaid enrollees had transitioning from a state administered Medicaid program to private managed care program were grouped into three general themes: Individual Barriers , Structural Barriers , and Questions about Medicaid. The Medicaid expansion in Illinois increased the number of people who receive health insurance. However , participants faced significant barriers using and understanding managed care because of their lack of previous experience using health insurance and the limited support provided by the state.
