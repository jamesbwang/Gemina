  In a chemical screen we identified thaxtomin A ( TXA) , a phytotoxin from plant pathogenic Streptomyces<pathogen> scabies , as a selective and potent activator of Flavin-dependent monooxygenase1 ( FMO1) expression in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana). TXA induction of FMO1 was unrelated to the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , plant cell death or its known inhibition of cellulose synthesis. TXA-stimulated FMO1 expression was strictly dependent on Enhanced disease susceptibility1 ( EDS1) and Phytoalexin deficient4 ( PAD4) but independent of salicylic acid ( SA) synthesis via Isochorismate synthase1 ( ICS1). TXA induced the expression of several EDS1/PAD4-regulated genes , including EDS1 , PAD4 , Senescence associated gene101 ( SAG101) , ICS1 , AGD2-like defense response protein1 ( ALD1) and Pathogenesis-related protein1 ( PR1) , and accumulation of SA. Notably , enhanced ALD1 expression did not result in accumulation of the product pipecolic acid ( PIP) , which promotes FMO1 expression during biologically induced systemic acquired resistance. TXA treatment preferentially stimulated expression of PAD4 compared to EDS1 , which was mirrored by PAD4 protein accumulation , suggesting that TXA leads to increased PAD4 availability to form EDS1/PAD4 signaling complexes. Also , TXA treatment of Arabidopsis plants led to enhanced disease resistance to bacterial and oomycete infection , which was dependent on EDS1- and PAD4 , as well as FMO1 and ICS1. Collectively , the data identify TXA as a potentially useful chemical tool to conditionally activate and interrogate EDS1- and PAD4-controlled pathways in plant immunity.
