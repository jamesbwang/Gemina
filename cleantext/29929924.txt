  Previous studies have identified age , nutritional status , and hematocrit as risk factors for unplanned ICU admission in gynecologic oncology patients. We sought to identify additional perioperative factors that can be predictive of unplanned ICU admission and its impact on outcomes in women with ovarian cancer undergoing ovarian cancer cytoreductive procedures. This was a case-control study of patients with unplanned ICU admission after primary surgery for ovarian cancer from January 2007 to December 2013. Controls were selected in a 2:1 ratio matching for primary surgeon and date of surgery. Clinical data was abstracted and compared between cases and controls using conditional logistic regression. The dataset consisted of 324 patients ( 108 ICU admissions , 216 controls). On multivariable analysis , failure to optimally cytoreduce ( p = 0.001 , OR 3.76) and higher EBL ( p < 0.001 , OR 1.20 per 100 cm ICU admission for women undergoing cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer is associated with a significant decrease in OS and increase in number of postoperative complications. For this inherently high-risk population , this information is critical when counseling patients about peri-operative risks in primary cytoreductive surgery.
