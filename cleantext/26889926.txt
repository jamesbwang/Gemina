  Lysine acetylation is a post-translational modification that is conserved from bacteria to humans. It is catalysed by the activities of lysine acetyltransferases , which use acetyl-CoA as the acetyl-donor molecule , and lysine deacetylases , which remove the acetyl moiety. Recently , it was reported that YcgC represents a new prokaryotic deacetylase family with no apparent homologies to existing deacetylases ( Tu et al. , 2015). Here we report the results of experiments which demonstrate that YcgC is not a deacetylase.
