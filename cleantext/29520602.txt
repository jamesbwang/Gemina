  Nutrient and energy recovery is becoming more important for a sustainable future. Recently , we developed a hydrogen gas recycling electrochemical system ( HRES) which combines a cation exchange membrane ( CEM) and a gas-permeable hydrophobic membrane for ammonia<pathogen> recovery. This allowed for energy-efficient ammonia<pathogen> recovery , since hydrogen gas produced at the cathode was oxidized at the anode. Here , we successfully up-scaled and optimized this HRES for ammonia<pathogen> recovery. The electrode surface area was increased to 0.04 m
