  Linear growth restriction is a unique feature of paediatric inflammatory bowel diseases ( IBD) , and reduced insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-1) is a major determinant of short stature. We aimed to assess factors influencing somatic height in children suffering from IBD. This was a retrospective , cross-sectional study conducted after approval by Institutional authorities. Anthropometric data , disease-related factors , biochemical and clinical indices of inflammation<symptom> and endocrine parameters were recorded and considered as explanatory covariates. A structural equation model analysis was utilized. Somatic height was the outcome of interest , and possible associations of explanatory covariates directly or through the mediation effect of IGF-1 were assessed. Systemic inflammation<symptom> , as expressed by high-sensitivity intereukin-6 ( IL-6) , and nutritional status described by body mass index ( BMI) were the pathways that significantly affected stature through the mediation effect of IGF-1. Cortisol showed a direct , positive and independent of IGF-1 association with height. Insulin-like growth factor-1 is a key player in the process that results in impaired linear growth. Malnutrition and systemic inflammation<symptom> have a restrictive action on growth by reducing circulating IGF-1. The positive relation of serum cortisol to height could correspond to suppressed pituitary-adrenal axis due to long-term use of glucocorticoids.
