  Polymeric nanoparticles ( NPs) represent one of the most promising tools in nanomedicine and have been extensively studied for the delivery of water-insoluble drugs. However , the efficient loading of therapeutic enzymes and proteins in polymer-based nanostructures remains an open challenge. Here , we report a synthesis method for a new enzyme delivery system based on cross-linked enzyme aggregates ( CLEAs) encapsulation into poly ( lactide- co-glycolide) ( PLGA) NPs. We tested the encapsulation strategy on four enzymes currently investigated for enzyme replacement therapy: palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 ( PPT1; defective in NCL1 disease) , galactosylceramidase ( GALC; defective in globoid cell leukodystrophy) , alpha glucosidase ( aGLU; defective in Pompe disease) , and beta glucosidase ( bGLU; defective in Gaucher 's disease). We demonstrated that our system allows encapsulation of enzymes with excellent activity retention ( usually around 60 %) , thus leading to functional and targeted nanostructures suitable for enzyme delivery. We then demonstrated that CLEA NPs efficiently deliver PPT1 in cultured cells , with almost complete enzyme release occurring in 48 h. Finally , we demonstrated that enzymatic activity is fully recovered in primary NCL1 fibroblasts upon treatment with PPT1 CLEA NPs.
