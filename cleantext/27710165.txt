  Contemporary elite soccer features increased physical demands during match-play , as well as a larger number of matches per season. Now more than ever , aspects related to performance optimization are highly regarded by both players and soccer coaches. Here , nutrition takes a special role as most elite teams try to provide an adequate diet to guarantee maximum performance while ensuring a faster recovery from matches and training exertions. It is currently known that manipulation and periodization of macronutrients , as well as sound hydration practices , have the potential to interfere with training adaptation and recovery. A careful monitoring of micronutrient status is also relevant to prevent undue fatigue<symptom> and immune impairment secondary to a deficiency status. Furthermore , the sensible use of evidence-based dietary supplements may also play a role in soccer performance optimization. In this sense , several nutritional recommendations have been issued. This detailed and comprehensive review addresses the most relevant and up-to-date nutritional recommendations for elite soccer players , covering from macro and micronutrients to hydration and selected supplements in different contexts ( daily requirements , pre , peri and post training/match and competition).
