  Although the Get with the Guidelines-Heart Failure ( GWTG-HF) group recently reported no association between hospital volume and 30-day outcomes in their registry , GWTG-HF hospitals are self-selected and tend to be higher-volume hospitals with active quality improvement departments. Thus , we explored the volume-outcome relationship for HF in an unselected population-based cohort of 241,533 adults admitted with HF as the most responsible diagnosis to any of 591 acute care institutions in Canada-none participate in GWTG-HF. We found inverse associations between volume and in-patient mortality ( 11.3 % in low-volume hospitals compared to 9.0 % in high-volume hospitals , adjusted odds ratio 0.90 ( 0.80-1.00)) and 30-day readmission rates ( 19.3 % in low-volume hospitals versus 17.3 % in high-volume hospitals , adjusted odds ratio 0.91 ( 0.85-0.97)).
