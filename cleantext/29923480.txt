  Few studies have reported the association between the Japanese diet as food score and mortality. This study aimed to investigate adherence to the Japanese food score associated with all-cause , CVD and cancer mortality. A total of 58 767 ( 23 162 men and 34 232 women) Japanese participants aged 40-79 years , who enrolled in the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study between 1988 and 1990 , were included. The Japanese food score was derived from the components of seven food groups ( beans and bean products , fresh fishes , vegetables , Japanese pickles , fungi<pathogen> , seaweeds and fruits) based on the FFQ. The total score ranged from 0 to 7 , and participants were divided into five categories based on scores ( 0-2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6-7). Hazard ratios ( HR) and 95 % CI for all-cause , CVD and cancer mortality based on sex were estimated using Cox proportional models. During the follow-up period until 2009 , 11 692 participants with all-cause , 3408 with CVD and 4247 with cancer died. The multivariable HR in the 6-7 and 0-2 Japanese food score groups were 0 · 93 ( 95 % CI 0 · 86 , 1 · 01) in men and 0 · 82 ( 95 % CI 0 · 75 , 0 · 90) in women for all-cause mortality and 0 · 89 ( 95 % CI 0 · 76 , 1 · 04) in men and 0 · 66 ( 95 % CI 0 · 56 , 0 · 77) in women for CVD mortality. Our findings suggest that adherence to the Japanese food score consisting of food combinations characterised by a Japanese diet may help in preventing all-cause and CVD mortality , especially in women.
