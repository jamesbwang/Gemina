  Rod fracture occurs with delayed fusion or pseudarthrosis after adult spinal deformity ( ASD) surgery. Rod fracture after apparent radiographic fusion has not been previously investigated. Patients with ASD in a multicenter database were assessed for radiographic fusion by a committee of 3 spinal deformity surgeons. Fusions were rated as bilaterally fused ( A) , unilaterally fused ( B) , partially fused ( C) , or not fused ( D). Patients with grade A or B fusion and 2-year follow-up were included. Patients with radiographic fusion were evaluated for subsequent rod fracture. Adjusted analyses were conducted with multiple logistic regression , using backwards-variable selection to a threshold of P < 0.2 , to assess for associated factors. Of 402 patients with radiographically apparent solid fusion , 9.5 % ( 38) subsequently suffered a broken rod. On multivariate analysis , greater rates of rod fracture were seen among patients of age group 60-69 years ( vs. 18-49) , body mass index 30-34 and 35 + ( vs. < 25) , stainless-steel rods ( vs. titanium) , patients with rods â‰¤ 5.5 mm ( vs. 6.35 mm) , and patients with Charlson score 0 ( vs. 3 +). Of the 38 patients with rod fractures , 18 ( 47.4 %) presented with worsened pain , and 8 ( 21.1 %) required revision at minimum 2-year follow-up. Rod fracture occurred in 9.5 % of patients with apparently solid radiographic fusion after ASD surgery. Advanced age , obesity , small diameter rods ( 5.5 mm) , osteotomy , and lower comorbidity burden were significantly associated with rod fracture. Nearly one-half of these patients noted worsening pain , and 21.1 % required revision surgery. Instrumentation failure may occur and may be symptomatic even in the setting of apparent fusion on plain radiographs.
