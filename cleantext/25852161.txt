  Clipping , removal of aboveground plant biomass , is an important issue in grassland ecology. However , few studies have focused on the effect of clipping on belowground microbial communities. Using integrated metagenomic technologies , we examined the taxonomic and functional responses of soil microbial communities to annual clipping ( 2010-2014) in a grassland ecosystem of the Great Plains of North<pathogen> America. Our results indicated that clipping significantly (
