  Many functional materials are difficult to analyse by scanning transmission electron microscopy ( STEM) on account of their beam sensitivity and low contrast between different phases. The problem becomes even more severe when thick specimens need to be investigated , a situation that is common for materials that are ordered from the nanometre to micrometre length scales or when performing dynamic experiments in a TEM liquid cell. Here we report a method to optimize annular dark-field ( ADF) STEM imaging conditions and detector geometries for a thick and beam-sensitive low-contrast specimen using the example of a carbon nanotube/polymer nanocomposite. We carried out Monte Carlo simulations as well as quantitative ADF-STEM imaging experiments to predict and verify optimum contrast conditions. The presented method is general , can be easily adapted to other beam-sensitive and/or low-contrast materials , as shown for a polymer vesicle within a TEM liquid cell , and can act as an expert guide on whether an experiment is feasible and to determine the best imaging conditions.
