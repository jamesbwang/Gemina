  During the last decade Campylobacter has been the most commonly reported gastrointestinal bacterial infection in humans in the European Union. The use of a sensitive detection method based on enrichment of Campylobacter<pathogen> spp. is often needed when examining foods. However , as background flora developed resistance to third generation Î²-lactams used in selective culture media , the ISO method was adapted. It now consists of three different procedures ( A , B , and C) depending on the expected concentration and condition of Campylobacter<pathogen> and the background microflora. As the diagnostic sensitivity of the detection test varies between laboratories , this justifies the validation of the method in an interlaboratory study. The matrices selected for testing in the collaborative trials were frozen spinach ( procedure A , Bolton enrichment broth) , minced meat ( procedure A , Bolton enrichment broth) , raw milk ( procedure B , Preston enrichment broth) , chicken skin ( procedure B , Preston enrichment broth) , and broiler caecal material ( procedure C , direct plating on mCCD agar). Each matrix was artificially inoculated with a different Campylobacter<pathogen> strain at a low and high contamination level , and with sterile diluent for ` blanks '. Seventeen laboratories participated in the interlaboratory study. The sensitivity and specificity of the methods for the five selected matrices were determined , as well as the level of detection ( LOD
