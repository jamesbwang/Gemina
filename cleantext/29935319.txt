  Minimally invasive surgery has become popular in recent times and has proved more advantageous than conventional open surgery methods , in terms of maximal preservation of natural anatomy and minimal postoperative complications. However , these advancements require a longer learning curve for inexperienced surgeons. The learning curve in minimally invasive spine surgery is complex and difficult to measure , and therefore operating times , conversion to open procedures , visual analog scale , and periods of hospital stay are used. In assessing complications as a measure of the learning curve , it was noted that nearly all the complications had been documented previously and became minimum after the 30th consecutive case. As surgical experience increases , perioperative parameters ( e.g. , operative time and length of hospitalization) improve. The downside of minimally invasive spine surgery is starting unfamiliar procedures without tactile sensation , working in a narrow restricted surgical field , and using endoscopes via two-dimensional imaging. Appropriate instruments , a trained team , and an adept radiographer are important assets for a smooth transition during the learning period. Structured training with cadavers and lots of practice , preferably while working under the guidance of experienced surgeons , is helpful. The learning curve can be shortened when a proficient surgeon gains relevant knowledge , understands three-dimensional anatomy , and has surgical aptitude along with manual dexterity.
