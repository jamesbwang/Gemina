  Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women in South Africa. One of the major risk factors for the development of cervical cancer is the human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>). To determine the knowledge of first-year female students living in residences on the main campus of the University of the Free State ( UFS) regarding cervical cancer and HPV<pathogen>. Female residences on the main campus of UFS. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on participants between the ages of 18 and 25 years using a non-random convenience sampling method. Seven residences were included. Anonymous self-administered questionnaires were distributed during the eveningmeetings to all first-year female students at the selected residences after an information session.Students had to complete the questionnaires immediately after the meeting. Most of the 373 respondents ( 85.8 %) knew that cervical cancer arises from the cervix , but only 15.4 % knew that it was caused by a virus. Of the 62.5 % participants who knew that HPV<pathogen> was a cancer-causing virus , most correctly knew that HPV<pathogen> was contracted by unprotected sexual intercourse ( 81.1 %) and that there is a vaccine to protect against HPV<pathogen> ( 73.1 %). However , 62.0 % knew that the vaccine was available in South Africa and only 31.0 % knew the vaccine was free of charge. The study revealed that students had limited knowledge of cervical cancer , HPVand vaccine availability.
