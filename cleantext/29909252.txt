  To compare the astigmatic correction in high myopic astigmatism between small-incision lenticule extraction and laser in situ keratomileusis ( LASIK) using vector analysis. Hong Kong Laser Eye Center , Hong Kong. Retrospective case series. Patients who had correction of myopic astigmatism of 3.0 diopters ( D) or more and had either small-incision lenticule extraction or femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK were included. Only the left eye was included for analysis. Visual and refractive results were presented and compared between groups. The study comprised 105 patients ( 40 eyes in the small-incision lenticule extraction group and 65 eyes in the femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK group.) The mean preoperative manifest cylinder was -3.42 D ± 0.55 ( SD) in the small-incision lenticule extraction group and -3.47 ± 0.49 D in the LASIK group ( P = .655). At 3 months , there was no significant between-group difference in uncorrected distance visual acuity ( P = .915) and manifest spherical equivalent ( P = .145). Ninety percent and 95.4 % of eyes were within ± 0.5 D of the attempted cylindrical correction for the small-incision lenticule extraction and LASIK group , respectively ( P = .423). Vector analysis showed comparable target-induced astigmatism ( P = .709) , surgically induced astigmatism vector ( P = .449) , difference vector ( P = .335) , and magnitude of error ( P = .413) between groups. The absolute angle of error was 1.88 ± 2.25 degrees in the small-incision lenticule extraction group and 1.37 ± 1.58 degrees in the LASIK group ( P = .217). Small-incision lenticule extraction offered astigmatic correction comparable to LASIK in eyes with high myopic astigmatism.
