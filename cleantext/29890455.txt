  Shipping emissions control is critical to air quality management and improved public health for coastal port cities and regions with heavy marine traffic. However , Asian port cities have been slow in introducing regulations on marine fuels for two main reasons- firstly , due to a lack of information and therefore appreciation on the air quality and public health benefits that could be derived; and secondly , due to sensitivity as to whether there may be negative impacts on port competitiveness and trade opposition. Hong Kong , one of the top-ten international container ports in the world , has been proactive in reducing shipping emissions in the past decade. The Ocean Going Vessels Fuel at Berth regulation , enforced since July 2015 in Hong Kong , is the first marine fuel control regulation for ocean going vessels in Asia. This regulation has been adopted nationally by China for its coastal ports , followed by the establishment of domestic emission control areas in its coastal waters that will come into force in 2019. This paper describes the decade-long journey where scientific research led to evidence-based policy changes. New insights and understanding arising from the research enabled cross-sectoral engagement and dialogue among the key stakeholders in government , industry and civil society , which resulted in the political consensus needed for a change in policy and legislation. Similar evidence-based policy formulation , together with public-private sectors dialogue could be useful to other jurisdictions in pursuing a `` win-win '' path to improve environmental protection and public health through regulating shipping emissions. The same combination of science-to-engagement-to-policy approach could also become part of a knowledge-and-consensus-building process for other environmental policy areas as well.
