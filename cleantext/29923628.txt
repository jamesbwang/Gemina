  The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence and consequences of technical complications in implant-supported restorative therapy. The occurrence and consequences of technical complications in implant-supported restorative therapy over a mean follow-up period of 5.3 years were assessed based on documentation in files from 2,666 patients. Risk indicators were identified by the use of survival models , considering repeated events. Results were expressed as hazard ratios ( HR) including 95 % confidence intervals. Technical complications occurred in 24.8 % of the patients. Chipping and loss of retention were the most common , affecting 11.0 % and 7.9 % of supraconstructions , respectively , while implant-related complications ( e.g. , implant fracture) were rare. More than 50 % of the affected patients experienced technical complications more than once and almost all reported complications led to interventions by a dental professional. The extent of the supraconstruction was the strongest risk indicator for both chipping ( HR < 0.2) and loss of retention ( HR > 3). Over a 5-year period , technical complications in implant-supported restorative therapy occurred frequently and their management required professional intervention.
