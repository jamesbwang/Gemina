  None We analyzed the bacterial community dynamics in the substrate during the four typical growth stages of The physicochemical properties of the substrate ( e.g. acidity , moisture , total nitrogen , total phosphorus and total potassium) changed between different growth stages. A total of 598,771 sequences from 12 samples were obtained and assigned to 22 bacterial phyla. The changes in bacterial community composition , diversity and predicted functions were most likely related to the changes in the moisture and nutrient conditions in the substrate with the growth of
