  Euglena gracilis Z and a `` sugar loving '' variant strain E. gracilis var. saccharophila were investigated as producers of paramylon , a β-1,3-glucan polysaccharide with potential medicinal and industrial applications. The strains were grown under diurnal or dark growth conditions on a glucose-yeast extract medium supporting high-level paramylon production. Both strains produced the highest paramylon yields ( 7.4-8 g · L
