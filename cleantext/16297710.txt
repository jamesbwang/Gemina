  Inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS) plays an important role in inflammation<symptom> , which has also been considered as a major driver of breast cancer disease progression. Radix Glycyrrhiza ( RG) has been broadly used for its anti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic effects. However , the mechanisms of regulation of iNOS in inflammation<symptom> and cancer have not been fully explored. Total flavonoids isolated from RG ( TFRG) exhibited anti-inflammatory activity through the regulation of ERK/NF-
