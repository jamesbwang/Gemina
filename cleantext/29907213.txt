  The protective effects of carbon monoxide against the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)- induced lung injury were attributed to maintenance of mitochondrial dynamics , but the mechanisms remain unexplored. Using a rat model of acute lung injury induced by LPS and the LPS attacking cell model , we investigated the effects of pretreatment of carbon monoxide molecule-2 ( CORM-2) on the acute lung injury and expressions of mitofusin proteins that play a critical role in mitochondrial dynamics. We found that preadministration of CORM-2 , not the inactive form of CORM-2 , significantly reduced the lung injury , levels of inflammatory cytokines , and the degree of oxidative stress caused by LPS. What was more , it increased the expressions of mitofusin proteins. Similar findings were also found in LPS-stimulating cell model. However , when the cells were treated in combination with LPS , CORM-2 , and SB203580 , it completely abolished the protection of CORM-2 , reflected by increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and malonaldehyde , decreased activities of superoxide dismutase , along with the lower expressions of mitofusin proteins and the ratio of p-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase to p38 mitogen activated protein kinase. Our observations suggest that pretreatment with CORM-2 could attenuate LPS-induced lung injury by inducing the expressions of mitofusin proteins via p38 mitogen activated protein kinase pathway.
