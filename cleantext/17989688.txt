  Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH) is a serious blood disorder characterized by dysregulated complement activation on blood cells. Eculizumab , the current standard therapy and a humanized anti-C5 mAb , relieves anemia<symptom> and thrombosis symptoms of PNH patients by preventing complement-dependent intravascular hemolysis<symptom> ( IVH). However , up to 20 % of PNH patients on long-term eculizumab treatment still suffer from significant anemia<symptom> and are transfusion dependent because of extravascular hemolysis<symptom> ( EVH) of C3-opsonized PNH erythrocytes. In this study , we show that function-blocking anti-properdin ( P) mAbs dose-dependently inhibited autologous , complement-mediated hemolysis<symptom> induced by factor H dysfunction. Furthermore , anti-human P ( hP) mAbs potently and dose-dependently inhibited acidified serum-induced hemolysis<symptom> of PNH erythrocytes ( Ham test). In contrast to erythrocytes rescued by anti-C5 mAb , nonlysed PNH erythrocytes rescued by anti-P mAb incurred no activated C3 fragment deposition on their surface. These results suggested that anti-P mAbs may prevent EVH as well as IVH of PNH erythrocytes. To test the in vivo efficacy of anti-hP mAbs in preventing EVH , we generated a P humanized mouse by transgenic expression of hP in P knockout mice ( hP-Tg/P
