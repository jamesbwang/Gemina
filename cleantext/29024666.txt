  The gut sensory vagus transmits a wide range of meal-related mechanical , chemical and gut peptide signals from gastrointestinal and hepatic tissues to the central nervous system at the level of the caudal brainstem. Results from studies using neurophysiological , behavioral physiological and metabolic approaches that challenge the integrity of this gut-brain axis support an important role for these gut signals in the negative feedback control of energy availability by limiting food intake during a meal. These experimental approaches have now been applied to identify important and unanticipated contributions of the vagal sensory gut-brain axis to the control of two additional effectors of overall energy balance<symptom>: the feedback control of endogenous energy availability through hepatic glucose production and metabolism , and the control of energy expenditure through brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Taken together , these studies reveal the pleiotropic influences of gut vagal meal-related signals on energy balance<symptom> , and encourage experimental efforts aimed at understanding how the brainstem represents , organizes and coordinates gut vagal sensory signals with these three determinants of energy homeostasis.
