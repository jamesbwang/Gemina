  Diffusion-weighted imaging is able to reflect histopathology architecture. A novel imaging approach , namely histogram analysis , is used to further characterize lesion<symptom> on MRI. To correlate histogram parameters derived from apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC) maps with histopathology parameters in muscle lymphoma. Eight patients ( mean age 64.8 years , range 45-72 years) with histopathologically confirmed muscle lymphoma were retrospectively identified. Cell count , total nucleic and average nucleic areas were estimated using ImageJ. Additionally , Ki67-index was calculated. Diffusion-weightedimaging was obtained on a 1.5 T scanner by using the b-values of 0 and 1000 s mm All ADC parameters showed a good to excellent interreader variability. Cell count correlated well with ADCmean ( ρ = -0.76 , p = 0.03) and ADCp75 ( ρ = -0.79 , p = 0.02). Kurtosis and entropy correlated with average nucleic area ( ρ = -0.81 , p = 0.02 , ρ = 0.88 , p = 0.007 , respectively). None of the analyzed ADC parameters correlated with total nucleic area and with Ki67-index. ADC histogram analysis parameters can reflect cellularity in muscle lymphoma. Advances in knowledge: Histogram parameters derived from ADC maps can reflect several different cellularity parameters in muscle lymphoma.
