  DNA replication and repair are essential biological processes needed for the survival of all organisms. Although these processes are fundamentally conserved in the three domains , archaea , bacteria and eukarya , the proteins and complexes involved differ. The genetic and biophysical tools developed for archaea in the last several years have accelerated the study of DNA replication and repair in this domain. In this review , the current knowledge of DNA replication and repair processes in archaea will be summarized , with emphasis on the contribution of genetics and other recently developed biophysical and molecular tools , including capillary gel electrophoresis , next-generation sequencing and single-molecule approaches. How these new tools will continue to drive archaeal DNA replication and repair research will also be discussed.
