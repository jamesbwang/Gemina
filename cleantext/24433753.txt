  The National Research Council ( CNR) prostate cancer monitoring project in Italy ( Pros-IT CNR) is an observational , prospective , ongoing , multicentre study aiming to monitor a sample of Italian males diagnosed as new cases of prostate cancer. The present study aims to present data on the quality of life at time prostate cancer is diagnosed. One thousand seven hundred five patients were enrolled. Quality of life is evaluated at the time cancer was diagnosed and at subsequent assessments via the Italian version of the University of California Los Angeles-Prostate Cancer Index ( UCLA-PCI) and the Short Form Health Survey ( SF-12). At diagnosis , lower scores on the physical component of the SF-12 were associated to older ages , obesity and the presence of 3 + moderate/severe comorbidities. Lower scores on the mental component were associated to younger ages , the presence of 3 + moderate/severe comorbidities and a T-score higher than one. Urinary and bowel functions according to UCLA-PCI were generally good. Almost 5 % of the sample reported using at least one safety pad daily to control urinary loss; less than 3 % reported moderate/severe problems attributable to bowel functions , and sexual function was a moderate/severe problem for 26.7 %. Diabetes , 3 + moderate/severe comorbidities , T2 or T3-T4 categories and a Gleason score of eight or more were significantly associated with lower sexual function scores at diagnosis. Data collected by the Pros-IT CNR study have clarified the baseline status of newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. A comprehensive assessment of quality of life will allow to objectively evaluate outcomes of different profile of care.
