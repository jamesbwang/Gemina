 : The influence of sex steroid hormones on periodontium can be lowered with good plaque control. The aim of the present study was to evaluate periodontal status in pre- and post-menopausal women with periodontitis<disease> following nonsurgical therapy. Interventional pre-post clinical trial. Periodontal status was measured by periodontal index ( PRI) , and oral hygiene status was measured by plaque index ( PI). Both the parameters were measured at baseline , i.e. before scaling and root planing and after 3 months intervals posttreatment. IBM SPSS version 21. The mean PRI scores in premenopausal group were 5.68 ± 0.64 and 2.53 ± 0.13 and PI scores were 1.84 ± 0.17 and 0.91 ± 0.13 , respectively , at baseline and 3 months. The mean PRI scores in postmenopausal group were 6.08 ± 0.47 and 2.54 ± 0.12 and PI scores were 1.86 ± 0.25 and 1.00 ± 0.24 , respectively , at baseline and 3 months. There was more desirable response to nonsurgical periodontal therapy in both the groups but not much variation in between two groups.
