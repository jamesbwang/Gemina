  Molybdenum disulfide has been demonstrated as a promising catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction ( HER). However , its performance is limited by fractional active edge sites and the strong dependence on hydrogen coverage. In this study , we find an enhanced HER performance in a two-dimensional substoichiometric molybdenum sulfide. Both first-principles calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the basal plane is catalytically active toward HER , as evidenced by an optimum Gibbs free energy and a low reaction overpotential. More interestingly , the HER performance is insensitive to hydrogen coverage and can be improved under compressive in-plane biaxial strains. Our results suggest not only an improved HER performance of substoichiometric molybdenum sulfide due to its chemical reactive basal plane but also a way to tune the performance.
