  We have used SWATH mass spectrometry to quantify 3648 proteins across 76 proteomes collected from genetically-diverse BXD mouse strains in two fractions ( mitochondria and total cell) from five tissues: liver , quadriceps , heart , brain , and brown adipose ( BAT). Across tissues , expression covariation between genes ' proteins and transcripts-measured in the same individuals-broadly aligned. Covariation was however far stronger in certain subsets than others: only 8 % of transcripts in the lowest expression and variance quintile covaried with their protein , in contrast to 65 % of transcripts in the highest quintiles. Key functional differences among the 3648 genes were also observed across tissues , with electron transport chain ( ETC) genes particularly investigated. ETC complex proteins covary and form strong gene networks according to tissue , but their equivalent transcripts do not. Certain physiological consequences , such as the depletion of ATP synthase in BAT , are thus obscured in transcript data. Lastly , we compared the quantitative proteomic measurements between the total cell and mitochondrial fractions for the five tissues. The resulting enrichment score highlighted several hundred proteins which were strongly enriched in mitochondria , which included several dozen proteins were not reported in literature to be mitochondrially localized. Four of these candidates were selected for biochemical validation , where we found MTAP , SOAT2 , and IMPDH2 to be localized inside the mitochondria , while ABCC6 was in the mitochondria-associated membrane. These findings demonstrate the synergies of a multi-omics approach to study complex metabolic processes , and this provides a resource for further discovery and analysis of proteoforms , modified proteins , and protein localization.
