  Recently , we have shown that the protecting layer of nanosize can be produced by means of ion beam mixing ( IBM) of a Si/C multilayer system. The corrosion resistance of the layer correlated with the SiC amount and distribution , determined by Auger electron spectroscopy depth profiling. It has also been shown that the IBM of the Si/C system can be well described by TRIDYN simulation. By combining these two findings , it is possible to design protective layers for various arrangements of layer structure and irradiation conditions. Three different multilayer structures ( with individual layer thicknesses falling in the range of 10-20 nm) have been irradiated by Ar
