  Exercise has increasingly been proposed as a healthful intervention prior to and after the onset of psychosis. There is some evidence to suggest that youth at clinical high risk ( CHR) for psychosis are less physically active and report more barriers to engaging in exercise; however , there has been relatively limited empirical work documenting this phenomenon , and to date , relationships between physical activity , barriers , and clinical phenomenology have been unclear. CHR ( N = 51) and healthy control ( N = 37) participants completed a structured clinical interview assessing attenuated psychotic symptoms and substance use , and an exercise survey that assessed current exercise practices , perceived physical fitness , and barriers related to engaging in exercise. CHR youth engaged in less physical activity , exhibited lower perception of fitness , and endorsed more barriers related to motivation for exercise. The CHR group showed significant negative correlations where lower perceptions of fitness were associated with increased negative , disorganized , and general symptoms. Decreased frequency of activity was related to more barriers of motivation. Interestingly , greater symptomatology in the CHR group was associated with more barriers of self-perception and motivation for engaging in exercise. However , findings suggested a nuanced relationship in this area; for example , increased physical activity was associated with increased substance use. The results of the current study support the notion that sedentary behavior is common in CHR youth , and more broadly , provide an impetus to target motivation through supervised exercise and fitness tracking to promote the health and well-being of CHR individuals.
