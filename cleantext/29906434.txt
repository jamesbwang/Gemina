  To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of using Prostate Health Index ( PHI) , 4Kscore , SelectMDx and ExoDx Prostate IntelliScore ( EPI) in men with an elevated PSA value to determine the need for biopsy. We developed a decision-analytic model for men with an elevated PSA values ( â‰¥ 3ng/mL) where one of the biomarker tests was to determine which hypothetical individuals required a biopsy. In the current standard of care strategy , all individuals underwent a biopsy. Model parameters were derived from a comprehensive review of the literature. Costs were calculated from a health sector perspective and converted into 2017 US dollars. The cost and QALYs of the current standard of care ( transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy) was $ 3,863 and 18.085 , respectively. The use of any of the three biomarkers improved quality-adjusted survival compared to the current standard of care. The cost of SelectMDx , PHI and EPI was lower than performing a prostate biopsy on all patients. However , PHI was more costly and less effective than the SelectMDx strategy. EPI provided the highest QALY with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $ 58,404 per QALY. The use of biomarkers could reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies by 24-34 % compared to the current standard of care. The use of biomarkers in men with an elevated PSA to determine the need for biopsy improves quality-adjusted survival by decreasing the number of biopsies performed and treatment of indolent disease. Obtaining a SelectMDx or EPI following an elevated PSA but before proceeding to a biopsy are cost-effective strategies in this setting.
