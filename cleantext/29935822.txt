  Enterococcus<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> WEFA23 is a potential probiotic strain from Chinese infants with the ability to decrease cholesterol levels. Aiming to explore the mechanism of E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> WEFA23 in lowering cholesterol in vivo , we examined the gene transcriptions related to cholesterol metabolism , the composition of bile acids in feces , the synthesis of trimethylamine N-oxide ( TMAO) in liver , and the composition of the gut microbiota of rats. We found that E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> WEFA23 enhanced the synthesis of bile acids by promoting cholesterol excretion , upregulating the genes transcript level relevant to cholesterol decomposition and transportation , and downregulating the genes involved in cholesterol synthesis. In addition , E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> WEFA23 not only downregulated the transcript levels of farnesoid X receptor and fibroblast growth factor 15 as well as flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 , but also decreased the TMAO production followed by increasing the CYP7A1 transcript level. Furthermore , when orally administered to rats for 35 d , E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> WEFA23 improved the gut microbiota diversity of rats fed a high-fat diet. Therein , the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes and the abundance of Rikenellaceae increased , whereas the number of Veillonellaceae decreased. These results suggest that reduction of cholesterol level by E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> WEFA23 might be related to the changes in the gut microbiota. Our finding provides important information on lowering cholesterol by E.<pathogen> faecium<pathogen> and reveals that Enterococcus<pathogen> spp. might have the potential to decrease the TMAO level.
