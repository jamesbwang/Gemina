  Objectives To determine if and how resident emotional health is monitored among otolaryngology training programs and to determine what wellness resources are available to otolaryngology residents. Study Design Survey. Setting Tertiary academic medical centers. Subjects and Methods An anonymous 50-item survey sent via REDCap to the 107 allopathic American otolaryngology program directors ( PDs). Results The response rate was 44 % , of whom 47.7 % regularly surveyed emotional health among their residents. A total of 33.3 % used the Maslach Burnout Inventory , and 61.9 % used another scale or did not know. Eighty-one percent of surveys were anonymous , and 45 % surveyed yearly , which was mandatory in only 33.3 % of programs. Whether surveys took place was not related to PD or program demographics. In total , 72.7 % of programs utilized faculty mentors for their residents; 88.6 % had a wellness lecture within the last year; and 74.5 % had no-cost mental health resources with extended hours as required by the American Council of Graduate Medical Education. Within the last year , 31.8 % had provided seminars in mindfulness or meditation. Seventy-five percent had financially supported social events for their residents; < 15 % supported athletic or mental wellness activities. Healthy foods were provided by 36.4 % , and 67.4 % of programs gave their residents days off in addition to vacation days for medical or dental appointments. Residents were allowed a mean 18.76 vacation days and 3.73 additional wellness days. Conclusion There is no standard practice for measuring and monitoring emotional health by otolaryngology programs. Programs struggle to offer interventions to prevent burnout , with 25 % noncompliant with the wellness requirements mandated by the American Council of Graduate Medical Education.
