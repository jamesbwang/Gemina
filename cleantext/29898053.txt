  To investigate the auditory ability of selective attention in the school population and to identify reference values to the age group from seven to ten years old through the Masking Level Difference Test , and to identify if the parents ' schooling , as well as the family income can influence the test results. Thirty-one schoolchildren who match the eligibility criteria attended the study , being 20 female and 11 male. An anamnesis was conducted to question the familiar income and the schooling of the children 's parents; we also performed visual inspection of the External Acoustic Meatus , Pure Tone Audiometry , Speech Audiometry , Acoustic Immittance Measures , Dichotic Digits Test and Masking Level Difference test. The mean age of the individuals was 8.67 years. There were no observed differences between genders and between the evaluated ages in the MLD performance. There was no relation between the parents ' schooling and the average monthly income with the performance of the children in MLD Test. The MLD mean was 7.65 dB and standard deviation of 2.51 dB. The Masking Level Difference in schoolchildren from seven to ten years old is 7.65 dB and is independent of the gender , parents ' schooling and the average monthly income of the schoolchild.
