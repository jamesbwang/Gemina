  Human siglecs are a family of 14 sialic acid binding proteins , most expressed on subsets of immune cells where they regulate immune responses. Siglec-8 is expressed selectively on human allergic inflammatory cells- primarily eosinophils and mast cells- where engagement causes eosinophil apoptosis and inhibits mast cell mediator release. Evidence supports a model in which human eosinophils and mast cells bind to Siglec-8 sialoglycan ligands on inflammatory target tissues to resolve allergic inflammation<symptom> and limit tissue damage. To identify Siglec-8-binding sialoglycans from human airways , proteins extracted from postmortem human trachea were resolved by size exclusion chromatography and composite agarose-acrylamide gel electrophoresis , blotted , and probed by Siglec-8-Fc blot overlay. Three size classes of Siglec-8 ligands were identified: 250 kDa , 600 kDa and 1 MDa , each of which was purified by affinity chromatography using a recombinant pentameric form of Siglec-8. Proteomic mass spectrometry identified all size classes as the proteoglycan aggrecan , a finding validated by immunoblotting. Glycan array studies demonstrated Siglec-8 binding to synthetic glycans with a terminal Neu5AcÎ±2-3 ( 6-sulfo)- Gal determinant , a quantitatively minor terminus on keratan sulfate ( KS) chains of aggrecan. Treating human tracheal extracts with sialidase or keratanase eliminated Siglec-8 binding , indicating sialylated KS chains as Siglec-8-binding determinants. Treating human tracheal histological sections with keratanase also completely eliminated binding of Siglec-8-Fc. Finally , Siglec-8 ligand purified from human trachea extracts induced increased apoptosis of freshly isolated human eosinophils in vitro. We conclude that sialylated keratan sulfate proteoglycans are endogenous human airway ligands that bind Siglec-8 and may regulate allergic
