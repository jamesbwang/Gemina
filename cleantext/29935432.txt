  Azole fungicides constitute an extensive group of potential emerging pollutants which can be found in natural environment. This study focuses on the biodegradation of clotrimazole and the characterization of cell surface properties of microorganisms capable of degradation of this compound. The influence of long-term contact of bacteria with clotrimazole and the impact of the addition of Saponaria officinalis extract on cell surface modification was also checked. The biodegradation of clotrimazole did not exceed 70 %. The presence of plant extract increased biodegradation of fungicide. The cells metabolic activity after one-month exposure to clotrimazole was the highest for each tested strain. Moreover , metabolic stress led to a strong modification of cell surface properties. The results are promising for determining the impact of clotrimazole on environmental microorganisms.
