  The presence of circulating tumor cells ( CTCs) has been found to correlate with colorectal cancer ( CRC) prognosis , whereas epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) in CTCs has been found to be associated with CRC metastasis. LGR5 is a known target of Wnt signaling and plays an important role in CRC development. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical relevance of EMT and LGR5 expression in CTCs from CRC patients. Sixty-six CRC patients were included in this study. The detection and expression of EMT phenotypes in CTCs from these patients were assessed using CanPatrol ™ CTC enrichment and mRNA in situ hybridization ( ISH) , respectively. LGR5 expression in the CTCs was assessed using mRNA ISH. CTCs were detected in 86.4 % ( 57/66) of the CRC patients included. Both the numbers of total CTCs and of CTCs displaying a mesenchymal phenotype ( M + CTCs) were found to significantly correlate with advanced disease stages and the occurrence of metastasis ( p < 0.05). An adjusted multivariate analysis also indicated that the number of M + CTCs significantly correlated with the occurrence of metastasis ( p = 0.031). Additionally , we found that a high LGR5 expression level significantly correlated with the occurrence of metastasis ( p < 0.05). We also found that the presence of ≥ 6 CTCs or ≥ 3 M + CTCs per 5 ml blood significantly correlated with disease progression ( p < 0.05). Patients with ≥ 6 CTCs or ≥ 3 M + CTCs per 5 ml blood were found to exhibit poorer progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) rates ( p < 0.05 in all cases). Using Cox regression analyses , we found that only total CTC numbers remained as independent prognostic factors for a worse PFS ( p = 0.043). From our data we conclude that CTC numbers and EMT phenotypes may serve as prognostic markers for disease progression and metastasis in CRC patients. In addition , we conclude that LGR5 expression in CTCs may serve as a marker for CRC metastasis.
