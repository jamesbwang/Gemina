  Inactivation of all HSV immediate early ( IE) genes to eliminate vector cytotoxicity results in rapid silencing of the viral genome , similar to the establishment of HSV latency. We recently reported that silencing of a non-viral reporter cassette could be overcome in non-neuronal cells by positioning the cassette in the viral latency ( LAT) locus between resident chromatin boundary elements. Here we tested the abilities of the chicken hypersensitive site 4 insulator and the human ubiquitous chromatin opening element A2UCOE to promote transgene expression from an IE gene-inactivated HSV vector. We found that A2UCOE was particularly active in non-neuronal cells and reduced reporter promoter occupancy by a repressive histone mark. We determined whether multiple transgenes could be expressed under different promoter control from different loci of the same virus. The results showed abundant co-expression of LAT-embedded and A2UCOE-flanked genes in non-neuronal cells. In addition , a third reporter gene without known protective elements was active in cultured rat sensory neurons. These findings indicate that cellular anti-silencing sequences can contribute to the expression of multiple genes from separate promoters in fully IE gene-disabled HSV vectors , providing an opportunity for therapeutic applications requiring mutually independent expression of different gene products from a single vector.
