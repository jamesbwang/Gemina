  Ocular near point of convergence ( NPC) has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of concussion and subconcussive impacts. To determine if NPC is also sensitive to a previous history of concussion , male contact-sport athletes either with ( n = 26) or without ( n = 16) a history of at least one previous concussion had their NPC assessed. The results showed that participants with a history of concussion displayed NPC values ( 9.4 ± 1.6 cm) indistinguishable from those with no history of concussion ( 8.4 ± 2.1 cm , t-test , p = 0.09). This was the case regardless of whether 1 , 2 , or 3 or more concussions had occurred and despite the fact participants with concussion ( mean time since last concussion: 1136 days) suffered from an increased number and severity of symptoms as assessed with the SCAT 3 ( 3.6 ± 2.2 vs. 2.13 ± 1.89 symptoms , 6.1 ± 4.1 vs. 3.19 ± 2.99 severity , t-test , p < 0.05). Taken together , these results imply that NPC may not be a suitable tool to assess the potential long-term effects of one or more concussions over a longer time frame.: Future research using larger sample sizes is warranted to evaluate the potential dose-response relationship between number of prior concussions and NPC.
