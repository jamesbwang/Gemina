  Working in conditions with daily exposure to organic solvents for many years can result in a disease known as chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy ( CSE). The aims for this study were to describe the neuropsychological course of CSE after first diagnosis and to detect prognostic factors for neuropsychological impairment after diagnosis. This prospective study follows a Dutch cohort of CSE patients who were first diagnosed between 2001 and 2011 and underwent a second neuropsychological assessment 1.5-2 years later. Cognitive subdomains were assessed and an overall cognitive impairment score was calculated. Paired t tests and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to describe the neuropsychological course and to obtain prognostic factors for the neuropsychological functioning at follow-up. There was a significant improvement on neuropsychological subdomains at follow-up , with effect sizes between small and medium ( Cohen 's d 0.27-0.54) and a significant overall improvement of neuropsychological impairment with a medium effect size ( Cohen 's d 0.56). Prognostic variables for more neuropsychological impairment at follow-up were a higher level of neuropsychological impairment at diagnosis and having a comorbid diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder at diagnosis. Results are in line with previous research on the course of CSE , stating that CSE is a non-progressive disease after cessation of exposure. However , during follow-up the percentage patients with permanent work disability pension increased from 14 to 37 %. Preventive action is needed in countries where exposure to organic solvents is still high to prevent new cases of CSE.
