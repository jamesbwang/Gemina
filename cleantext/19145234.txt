  To describe the features of 2 unrelated adults with xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group F ( XP-F) ascertained in a neurology care setting. We report the clinical , imaging , molecular , and nucleotide excision repair ( NER) capacity of 2 middle-aged women with progressive neurodegeneration ultimately diagnosed with XP-F. Both patients presented with adult-onset progressive neurologic deterioration involving chorea , ataxia<symptom> , hearing loss , cognitive deficits , profound brain atrophy , and a history of skin photosensitivity , skin freckling , and/or skin neoplasms. We identified compound heterozygous pathogenic mutations in These cases illustrate the role of NER dysfunction in neurodegeneration and how adult-onset neurodegeneration could be the major symptom bringing XP-F patients to clinical attention. XP-F should be considered by neurologists in the differential diagnosis of patients with adult-onset progressive neurodegeneration accompanied by global brain atrophy and a history of heightened sun sensitivity , excessive freckling , and skin malignancies.
