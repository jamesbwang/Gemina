  Besides smoking , low or high body mass index ( BMI) is associated with chronic lung disease ( CLD). It is unclear how CLD is associated with BMI , whether smoking interacts with this association , and how the associations differ from the patterns known for lung cancer. Our population comprised 35,212 individuals aged 14-99 , who participated in population-based surveys conducted in 1977-1993 in Switzerland ( mortality follow-up until 2014). We categorized smokers into never , former , light , and heavy; and BMI into underweight , normal weight , overweight , and obese. Hazard ratios ( HRs) were obtained with multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. CLD mortality was strongly associated with being underweight. This was mainly due to the effect in men ( HR 5.04 ( 2.63-9.66)) and also prevailed in never smokers ( HR 1.81 ( 1.11-3.00)). Obesity was also associated with CLD mortality ( HR men: 1.37 ( 1.01-1.86) , women: 1.39 ( 0.90-2.17)) , but not with lung cancer mortality. In line with lung cancer , for CLD , the BMI-mortality association followed the same shape in all smoking categories , suggesting that this association was largely independent of smoking status. The shape of the BMI-mortality association was inversely linear for lung cancer but followed a U-shape for CLD. Further research should examine the potentially protective effect of obesity on lung cancer occurrence and the possibly hazardous impact of underweight on CLD development.
