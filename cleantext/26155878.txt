  Research and development for interactive digital health interventions requires multi-disciplinary expertise in identifying user needs , and developing and evaluating each intervention. Two of the central areas of expertise required are Health ( broadly defined) and Human-Computer Interaction. Although these share some research methods and values , they traditionally have deep differences that can catch people unawares , and make interdisciplinary collaborations challenging , resulting in sub-optimal project outcomes. The most widely discussed is the contrast between formative evaluation ( emphasised in Human-Computer Interaction) and summative evaluation ( emphasised in Health research). However , the differences extend well beyond this , from the nature of accepted evidence to the culture of reporting. In this paper , we present and discuss seven lessons that we have learned about the contrasting cultures , values , assumptions and practices of Health and Human-Computer Interaction. The lessons are structured according to a research lifecycle , from establishing the state of the art for a given digital intervention , moving through the various ( iterative) stages of development , evaluation and deployment , through to reporting research results. Although our focus is on enabling people from different disciplinary backgrounds to work together with better mutual understanding , we also highlight ways in which future research in this interdisciplinary space could be better supported.
