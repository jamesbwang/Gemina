  Accumulation and oligomerization of amyloid-beta ( Aβ) peptides have been known to be a potent cause of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). To expand the possibilities of preventing AD , we investigated the effects of resveratrol dimers , gnetin C and ε-viniferin , on Aβ 1-42 ( Aβ42) production and the reduced cell viability observed after Aβ42 treatment ( monomers , 10 μM) in cultured SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Among them , addition of gnetin C ( 20 μM) into the media reduced Aβ42 production most efficiently. Gnetin C suppressed the expression of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme-1 ( BACE1 , β-secretase). Furthermore , gnetin C ameliorated the Aβ42-reduced cell viability most significantly. Concomitantly , gnetin C reduced intracellular Aβ oligomers ( ca. 15 and 130 kDa) and elevated both levels of intracellular and extracellular Aβ monomers. Under the treatment with or without Aβ42 , gnetin C upregulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-14 ( MMP-14) which is assumed to be an Aβ-decomposing enzyme. Gnetin C may thereby prevent Aβ toxicity by suppressing BACE1 and enhancing MMP-14 , together with reducing both internalization and oligomerization of exogenous Aβ monomers. The use of gnetin C may lead to the prevention of Aβ-mediated diseases , particularly AD.
