  Both cation-exchange membranes<symptom> and anion-exchange membranes<symptom> are used as ion conducting membranes<symptom> in vanadium redox flow batteries ( VRFBs). Anion-exchange membranes<symptom> ( AEMs) are applied in vanadium redox flow batteries due to the high blocking property of vanadium ions via the Donnan exclusion effect. In this study , novel anion-exchange blend membranes<symptom> ( AEBMs) were prepared , characterized , and applied in VRFBs. Bromomethylated poly ( 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) , poly ( ( 1- ( 4,4 & prime;- diphenylether) -5-oxybenzimidazole)- benzimidazole) ( PBI-OO) and sulfonated polyether sulfone polymer were combined to prepare 3-component AEBMs with 1,2,4,5-tetramethylimidazole ( TMIm) for quaternization. 3-component AEBMs showed significantly enhanced chemical and mechanical properties compared with those of 2-component AEBMs , resulting in an improved performance in VRFBs. The compositions of the anion-exchange polymers in 3-component AEBMs were systematically varied to optimize the AEBMs for the redox-flow battery application. While the 3-component AEBMs showed comparable efficiencies with Nafion
