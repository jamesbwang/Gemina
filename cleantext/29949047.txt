  Due to the rarity of BRAF V600E mutation , no randomized study has compared the combination targeted therapy dabrafenib + trametinib with other second-line treatments for advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). A network meta-analysis ( NMA) was conducted to assess the comparative efficacy of treatments among patients with previously treated advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Randomized trials of dabrafenib + trametinib , docetaxel , erlotinib , nintedanib + docetaxel , nivolumab , pemetrexed , pembrolizumab , and best supportive care as second-line or above treatments for advanced or metastatic NSCLC identified in a systematic literature review were included in the NMA. Overall response rates ( ORRs) and disease control rates ( DCRs) were compared using logit models; progression-free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS) were compared using fractional polynomial hazards models. Dabrafenib + trametinib was linked into the evidence network through a matching-adjusted indirect comparison versus nivolumab. Ten trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in the NMA. Dabrafenib + trametinib , pembrolizumab , and nivolumab were associated with the highest odds of achieving overall response ( 12.2 , 1.2 , and 0.7 times higher , respectively , compared with docetaxel). Estimated DCR was higher for dabrafenib + trametinib , nintedanib + docetaxel , and pemetrexed compared with other treatments. Patients treated with dabrafenib + trametinib , nivolumab , and pembrolizumab had the lowest hazards of disease progression or death during follow-up ( 72 , 61 , and 29 % lower hazard of progression at 6 months; 61 , 48 , and 46 % lower hazard of death at 1 year , respectively , compared with docetaxel). Dabrafenib + trametinib , pembrolizumab , and nivolumab were associated with higher ORR and prolonged PFS and OS compared with chemotherapy in previously treated advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
