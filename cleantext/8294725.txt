  The study evaluates the impact of biopsychosocial factors involved in food allergy ( FA) on the prevalence of eating disorders ( ED). For the 5-year follow-up studies , 75 participants ( aged 1-14 years) with early-onset FA and 81 healthy peers were included. Participants were diagnosed with FA using antibody/cytokine content immunoassay tests. Medical history , including BMI z-scores , was completed using data obtained in response to a validated allergic questionnaire that incorporated the SCOFF and EAT-8 screening questionnaires for ED. FA was confirmed if total IgE was elevated , specific sIgE to food allergens exceeded 0.7 kUA/L and if manifestations were observed. Screening for ED was considered positive if two or more SCOFF and EAT-8 items were confirmed. In the FA + group , 50 % of female participants and 6.7 % of their healthy female peers reported ED. An ED + result was more frequent in FA + individuals than in their healthy peers ( p = 0.046) although the association is weak. In the FA +/ ED + group , 25.3 % of the participants were underweight , and 14.7 % were overweight compared to their peers where this reached respectively 4.2 % and 2.8 % ( p < 0.005). 74 % of the FA +/ ED + individuals reported elimination diet implementation and only 15 % declared it was medically consulted. The prevalence of ED in the FA + male group was consistently correlated with lack of confidence in FA issues ( r = 0.5424) and in the FA + female group with applied medical procedures ( r = 0.7069; p < 0.005). These findings suggest that participants with FA especially struggling with lack of confidence in FA issues and those following an uncontrolled , restrictive elimination diet are more prone to food aversion and ED than their healthy peers. Applied procedures are necessary , and their neglect is associated with FA deterioration; however , the possibility of ED and biopsychosocial implications development should not be underestimated.
