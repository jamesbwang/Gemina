  An efficient protocol for the synthesis of internal aryl alkynes was achieved via Cu-catalyzed decarboxylative cross-coupling reactions , and to the best of our knowledge , this is the first example of a Cu-catalyzed decarboxylative alkynylation of benzoic acids with terminal alkynes. This approach utilizes simple Cu salt as catalyst and O
