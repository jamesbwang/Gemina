  Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) is a main cause of cancer death all over the world. Treatment and outcome of HCC based on its early diagnosis. This study was conducted to estimate the role of talin-1 and midkine in combination with total antioxidant capacity ( TAC) as tumor markers in HCC patients. Methods: Serum levels of talin-1 and midkine were measured in 90 Egyptian subjects including 44 patients with HCC , 31patients with cirrhosis and 15 healthy controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) technique. While a colorimetric method was used for measurement of TAC. Results: Serum talin-1 in HCC patients was significantly lower than that in patients with cirrhosis ( P < 0.001) and normal control ( P < 0.001). In addition , increased invasion and metastasis correlated with reduced talin-1 level. Serum midkine in HCC patients was significantly higher compared to cirrhotic patients ( P < 0.001) and normal control ( P < 0.001). Midkine at a cut off value of 1683 pg/ml showed a sensitivity of ( 81.82 %) and specificity of ( 83.87 %). While alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP) at a cut off value of 200 ng/ml had a sensitivity of ( 52.27 %) , while specificity was ( 96.77 %). Midkine was positive in 80.9 % of HCC patients with negative AFP. Serum TAC was significantly decreased in HCC patients when compared with control group ( P < 0.001). Conclusion: Talin-1 may be implicated in the carcinogenesis and metastasis of HCC and can be used as a useful tumor marker for HCC. Midkine may be a potential diagnostic marker for HCC and may be used in addition to AFP to increase the sensitivity of HCC detection.
