  A novel naphthalene-Bodipy dye ( N-Bodipy) was designed , prepared and characterized. N-Bodipy showed a selective and sensitive recognition toward Cu ( ii) ions as a fluorescent antenna group in acetonitrile/water over other metal cations. The complexation between Cu ( ii) ions and N-Bodipy gave a specific color<symptom> change<symptom> as well as caused fluorescence quenching under long-wavelength light ( 365 nm). The remarkable quenching effect in fluorescence intensity centered at 538 nm was only observed in the presence of copper ( ii) ions. Moreover , the orange color of N-Bodipy solution turned pale-yellow depending on the complexation effect in daylight. The complex stoichiometry was determined using a Job 's plot and it was found to be 2: 1 ( ligand/metal). The binding constant was calculated with the Benesi-Hildebrand equation to be 1.39 × 1010 M-1 and the detection limit was 1.28 μM ( LOD = 3α/slope , α is the standard deviation) for Cu ( ii). The data proved that the binding between N-Bodipy and Cu ( ii) is chemically reversible.
