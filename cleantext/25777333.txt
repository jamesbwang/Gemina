  Cervical spinal cord injury with the C3 neurological level may cause respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> and require long-term mechanical ventilation. Conventional weaning of spontaneous breathing trials is difficult to perform outside of intensive care or spinal cord units. An 80-year-old man presented with total tetraplegia and restrictive respiratory<symptom> failure<symptom> that required assisted ventilation after a falling accident. Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging showed cervical cord compression that was worst at the C3-C4 intervertebral level. He experienced unexpected cardiac arrest during the conventional weaning process of trials of intermittent spontaneous breathing in the intensive care unit. The automated weaning protocol utilizing a closed-loop ventilation mode ( IntelliVent An automated weaning protocol utilizing a closed-loop ventilation mode could be an optional procedure in patients with cervical cord injury on long-term mechanical ventilation , even in a ward for chronically ill patients where sufficient staff is not available. The efficacy and safety , and the cost-effectiveness of the procedure should be examined in larger spinal cord units.
