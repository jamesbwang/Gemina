  A four-year retrospective analysis of injury data was conducted on a collegiate ( NCAA Division I) women 's volleyball team. Twenty athletes ( Year 1: age = 19.4 ± 0.9 y , height = 175.2 ± 5.1 cm , body mass = 70.5 ± 10.2 kg; Year 2: age = 20.1 ± 1.0 y , height = 175.7 ± 4.7 cm , body mass = 69.5 ± 10.1 kg; Year 3: age = 20.1 ± 1.4 y , height = 173.8 ± 6.3 cm , body mass = 69.9 ± 10.8 kg; Year 4: age = 19.5 ± 1.4 y , height = 174.4 ± 8.6 cm , body mass = 72.7 ± 10.8 kg) participated in this study , accounting for 1483 total training exposures. Injury was defined as any damage to a body part , incurred during volleyball or strength and conditioning-related activities , which interfered with training and/or competition. Injury rate was normalized to the number of athletes and exposure and expressed as injuries per 1000 exposures. A total of 133 injuries were recorded. The most common injury was to the knee ( left = 7.5 % , right = 12.0 %). Injuries occurred most often in volleyball practice ( 75.2 %) , followed by competition ( 20.3 %) , and strength and conditioning-related activities ( 4.5 %). Non-contact injuries ( upper body = 26.3 % , lower body = 53.4 %) were more common than contact injuries ( upper-body = 13.5 % , lower-body = 6.8 %). An examination of injury rates relative to the training year revealed patterns in injury occurrence. Specifically , spikes in injury rate were consistently observed during periods of increased training volume that were preceded by breaks in organized training , such as the early pre-season and off-season training periods.
