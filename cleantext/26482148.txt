  Evidence suggests that flavonoids , polyphenolic compounds found in many plant-derived foods , such as berries , may allay cognitive impairment. We review recent research exploring the protective effects of flavonoids on age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders in humans and animals. We also address the mechanisms by which flavonoids may exert their effects and promising avenues of future research. Flavonoids have been found to decrease neuroinflammation , reduce oxidative stress , and mediate neuroplasticity in animal models of neurodegeneration and aging. Injecting flavonoids encased in metal nanoparticles may further enhance the efficacy of flavonoids. Animal studies also demonstrate that flavonoid supplementation may alleviate neurodegenerative cognitive and memory<symptom> impairments<symptom>. Limited human studies , however , demonstrate the need for further clinical research investigating flavonoids. Flavonoid supplementation , as well as dietary modification to include whole foods high in flavonoids , may provide therapeutic potential for aging individuals experiencing cognitive deficits resulting from neurodegeneration.
