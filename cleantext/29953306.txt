  To report long-term outcomes of topical ganciclovir ( GCV) and corticosteroids in Korean patients with cytomegalovirus ( CMV) corneal endotheliitis. This retrospective study included 13 eyes from 13 patients with CMV corneal endotheliitis , with a follow-up period of 24.5 Â± 8.2 months. The patients were consistently maintained with topical 2 % GCV and 1 % prednisolone acetate eyedrop. All patients demonstrated unilateral typical coin-shaped keratic precipitates ( KPs) or linear KP , and positive CMV polymerase chain reaction of aqueous humor. After 2 weeks of treatment , all patients showed decrease of clinical signs. During the follow-up , four patients developed mild anterior chamber inflammation<symptom> with increased intraocular pressure without typical coin-shaped KPs or edema<symptom> , started to use the initial dose , and resolved the clinical signs. One patient showed recurrence of corneal edema<symptom> twice , and was administered systemic valgancyclovir for 2 weeks upon second recurrence with resolution of clinical signs. Long-term maintenance therapy with topical GCV and corticosteroids are effective and maintain corneal endothelial function in Korean patients with CMV endotheliitis.
