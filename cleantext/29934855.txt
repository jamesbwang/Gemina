  Ghrelin , a gut-brain peptide hormone , is implicated in a multiplicity of biological functions , including energy homeostasis and reproduction. Neuronal systems that are involved in energy homeostasis as well as reproduction traverse the hypothalamus; however , the mechanism by which they control energy homeostasis is not fully understood. The present study analyzes the anatomical relationship of neurons expressing gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH) , neuropeptide Y ( NPY) and growth hormone-releasing hormone ( GHRH) in a cichlid , tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus). Additionally , we examine in vivo effects of ghrelin on these hypothalamic neurons and plasma growth hormone ( GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1) levels. Double-immunofluorescence showed neuronal fiber associations between GnRH , NPY and GHRH in the brain and pituitary. Intracerebroventricular injection of ghrelin had no effect on numbers , soma size , or optical density of GnRH and NPY neurons , whereas the number of GHRH neurons was significantly decreased in the animals injected with ghrelin when compared to controls , which may indicate administered ghrelin promoted GHRH release. Plasma GH and pituitary GH mRNA levels were significantly increased in the animals injected with ghrelin. These results suggest that central administration of ghrelin primarily act on hypothalamic GHRH neurons to stimulate GH release from the pituitary in the tilapia.
