  With the re-emergence of sodium ion batteries ( NIBs) , we discuss the reasons for the recent interests in this technology and discuss the synergies between lithium ion battery ( LIB) and NIB technologies and the potential for NIB as a `` drop-in '' technology for LIB manufacturing. The electrochemical testing of sodium materials in sodium metal anode arrangements is reviewed. The performance , stability , and polarization of the sodium in these test cells lead to alternative testing in three-electrode and alternative anode cell configurations. NIB manufacturability is also discussed , together with the impact that the material stability has upon the electrodes and coating. Finally , full-cell NIB technologies are reviewed , and literature proof-of-concept cells give an idea of some of the key differences in the testing protocols of these batteries. For more commercially relevant formats , safety , passive voltage control through cell balancing and cell formation aspects are discussed.
