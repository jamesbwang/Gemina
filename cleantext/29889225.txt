  The red fox ( Vulpes vulpes) occurs on multiple continents in diverse habitats , making it an informative system for evolutionary genomic research. However , its phylogeography remains unclear. Previously , mitochondrial DNA and small numbers of nuclear loci provided discordant views. Both markers indicated deep divergence ( ~ 0.5 million years ( MY)) between Eurasian and southern North American populations but differed in the apparent continental affinity of Alaskan red foxes , implying some degree of gene exchange during secondary contact ( ~ 0.1 MY). We assayed > 173000 nuclear genomic sites in 52 red foxes , along with 2 Rueppell 's foxes ( Vulpes rueppellii) and a gray wolf ( Canis<pathogen> lupus) using the Illumina CanineHD BeadChip. We obtained 5107 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) in the foxes. Consistent with the Afro-Eurasian origins of red foxes , genetic diversity was higher in Eurasian than North American samples. Phylogenetic trees indicated that Alaskan and southern North American red foxes formed a monophyletic group nested within the Eurasian clade. However , admixture models suggested Alaskan red foxes contained up to 40 % Eurasian ancestry. We hypothesize that North American red foxes either hybridized with Eurasian foxes in Beringia at the start of the last glaciation or merged with a Beringian population after the last glaciation. Future work is needed to test between these scenarios and assess speciation.
