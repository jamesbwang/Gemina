  In patients at high bleeding risk treated with 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy , the polymer-free , biolimus A9-coated BioFreedom stent ( BFS) was found safer and more efficacious than bare metal stents. We used sequential optical coherence tomography ( OCT) to assess the time course of strut coverage and neointimal transformation from 1 to 9 months. We randomly assigned 104 BFS recipients to 1 of 5 groups with angiography and OCT follow-up at 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 5 months , together with another follow-up for all at 9 months. The primary endpoint was the degree of OCT-detected strut coverage at 9 months. From 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 months , median neointimal strut coverage increased from 85.8 , 87.0 , 88.6 , 96.8 to 97.1 % , respectively; and at 9 months to 99.6 % ( IQR 98.2- 99.9). At 9 months , median percent neointimal volume was 13.0 % and angiographic late lumen loss was 0.21 Â± 0.30 mm. Major adverse cardiac event ( MACE) were limited to 1 non-cardiac death , 1 non-ST elevation MI not related to BFS , and 2 target lesion<symptom> revascularizations ( MACE rate 4.0 %) without stent thrombosis. Neointimal strut coverage of BFS was rapid and BRF showed clinically safe and effective.
