  Oncolytic measles<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( MV<pathogen>) is effective in xenograft models of many tumor types in immune-compromised mice. However , no murine cell line exists that is tumorigenic , grows in immune-competent mice , and is killed by MV<pathogen>. The lack of such a model prevents an examination of the effect of the immune system on MV<pathogen> oncotherapy. Cerebellar stem cells from human CD46-transgenic immunocompetent mice were transduced to express Sendai virus C-protein , murine C-Myc , and Gfi1b proteins. The resultant cells were injected into the brain of NSG mice , and a cell line , called CSCG , was prepared from the resulting tumor. CSCG cells are highly proliferative , and express stem cell markers. These cells are permissive for replication of MV<pathogen> and are killed by the virus in a dose- and time-dependent manner. CSCG cells form aggressive tumors that morphologically resemble medulloblastoma when injected into the brains of immune-competent mice. On the molecular level , CSCG tumors overexpress natriuretic peptide receptor 3 and gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor alpha 5 , markers of Group 3 medulloblastoma. A single intratumoral injection of MV<pathogen> green fluorescent protein resulted in complete tumor regression and prolonged survival of animals compared with treatments with phosphate buffered saline ( P = 0.0018) or heat-inactivated MV<pathogen> ( P = 0.0027). This immune-competent model provides the first platform to test therapeutic regimens of oncolytic MV<pathogen> for Group 3 medulloblastoma in the presence of anti-measles immunity. The strategy presented here can be used to make MV-sensitive murine models of any human tumor for which the driving mutations are known.
