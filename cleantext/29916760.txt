  Levamisole ( LVM) is a common adulterant in clandestinely manufactured cocaine ( COC) , with a range of well-documented deleterious health effects. Although the prevalence of LVM in COC has been widely noted , the subjective effects related to concomitant COC-LVM administration are poorly understood. The present study sought to compare the subjective effects of LVM alone and in combination with COC in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats trained to discriminate COC from vehicle injections. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate COC from vehicle injections using a two-lever , food-reinforced drug discrimination procedure. Subsequent dose-effect curves were generated for COC , LVM , and a variety of COC-LVM combinations. No significant difference in males and females was observed on any measure of responding. LVM alone dose-dependently decreased response rates and failed to produce substitution for COC. When LVM was administered with COC , previously ineffective doses of COC engendered COC-appropriate responding. LVM potentiates the subjective effects of COC when administered concomitantly. These findings are consistent with the popular notion that LVM is added as an adulterant to COC to amplify the subjective effects of COC administration.
