  The maximum of a muscle fiber 's force-length curve ( FLC) shifts to shorter lengths as muscle activation increases. State-of-the-art muscle models can not explain the mechanistic basis for this shift , which is therefore either omitted or added ad hoc in a descriptive manner. A more theoretical approach developed by Hatze , who had particularly modeled the process of muscle activation , does predict this shift but can be shown to consist of multiple mathematical attempts that are all inconsistent with their common assertion: to represent local volume constancy. What mechanism may underlie the experimentally well-known shift has thus remained unclear. We work out here that the simple assumption of sarcomere volume constancy can , first of all , indeed explain the shift in the activity-Ca
