  Colloid cysts<symptom> usually occur in the anterior third ventricle at the level of the foramina of Monro. Colloid cysts<symptom> may extend from the third toward the lateral ventricle. We present a rare case of multiple intraventricular colloid cysts<symptom> , two of which were in the third ventricle and one in the lateral ventricle. A 40-year-old female patient presented with three intraventricular cystic lesions<symptom>: one cyst<symptom> in the typical localization in the anterior rostral third ventricle , another cyst<symptom> behind it in the same ( third) ventricle , and a larger bulging cyst<symptom> in the right lateral ventricle. A bilateral ventriculoperitoneal shunt had been inserted 26 years before to treat hydrocephalus<symptom>. All three cysts<symptom> had different magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) signal characteristics. We removed the cysts<symptom> through an endoscopically assisted right transcortical transventricular microsurgical approach , using the right ventricular catheter as a guide to the lateral ventricle. After removal of the lateral ventricular cyst<symptom> , we observed that the foramen of Monro was greatly enlarged ( most likely as a result of the large cyst<symptom>) , which allowed us to remove the cysts<symptom> in the third ventricle. During surgery , the cysts<symptom> were found to have different consistencies. MRI 2 years following surgery showed complete removal and no hydrocephalus<symptom>. The patient had no symptoms , and the clinical examinations were normal. Colloid cysts<symptom> may become large and extend to the lateral ventricle , especially in patients treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Studying the relevant pathoanatomy of these cysts<symptom> is very important for preoperative planning including the choice of surgical approach.
