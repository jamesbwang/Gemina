  Mitochondrial fragmentation is a crucial mechanism contributing to tubular cell apoptosis during acute kidney injury ( AKI). However , the mechanism of modulating mitochondrial dynamics during AKI remains unclear. Numb is a multifunction adaptor protein that is expressed in renal tubules. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of Numb in mitochondrial dysfunction during AKI. The expression of Numb was upregulated in both ischemia-reperfusion- and cisplatin-induced AKI. Depletion of Numb from proximal tubules ( PT-Nb-KO) exacerbated AKI shown as more severe renal tubular damage and higher serum creatinine than wild-type mice. Numb depletion alone significantly increased mitochondrial fragmentation without altering mitochondrial mass and function , including adenosine triphosphate production , mitochondrial membrane potential , oxygen consumption , and reactive oxygen species production. However , mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction were significantly aggravated after cisplatin exposure in PT-Nb-KO mice. Mechanistically , Numb depletion triggered dynamin-related protein 1 ( Drp1) recruitment to mitochondria by increasing the phosphorylation of Drp1 at serine 656 residue ( human Drp1 ser
