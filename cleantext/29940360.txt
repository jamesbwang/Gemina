  Membrane technology has been widely employed for seawater desalination , water and wastewater reclamation , while membrane fouling still remains as a major challenge. The polysaccharides in extracellular polymeric substances ( EPS) have been recognized as an important foulant that causes serious membrane fouling , while the detailed structure of polysaccharides and the intermolecular interactions between them have not been adequately disclosed. In this study , two different polysaccharides and their mixtures were used to study the intermolecular cross-linking of polysaccharides as well as its effects on membrane fouling. Results demonstrated that the fouling propensities of distinct polysaccharides were completely different , which was attributed to the different intermolecular interactions lying in polysaccharides. The cross-linking among molecules of polysaccharide , regardless of the homogeneity , was found to form complex networks and determine the effective dimension of polysaccharides. Depending on the effective dimension of foulants , pore blocking and cake layer occurred subsequently during filtration processes. In light of this , it potentially gives new insights into the fouling behaviours by combining the structure-function knowledge of polysaccharides with their fouling propensity. In addition , transparent exopolymeric particles ( TEP) measurement was found to provide an intuitionistic evaluation of the complex networks formed from polysaccharides , so that may act as a good indicator of fouling during membrane filtration.
