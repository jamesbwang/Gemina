  Among children with FGFR2-associated Pfeiffer syndrome<disease> , those with the W290C pathogenic variant ( PV) are reported to have the worst clinical outcomes. Mortality is high , and severe neurocognitive impairment has been reported in all surviving patients. However , it is unclear whether these poor outcomes are an unavoidable consequence of the PV itself , or could be improved with a genotype-specific treatment approach. The purpose of this report is to describe the more intensive surgical approach used for each of the three patients with W290C PV in FGFR2 at our center , all of whom survived and have normal neurocognitive functioning. Retrospective chart review. In contrast to other patients with Pfeiffer syndrome<disease> at our center , all three patients who were subsequently found to have a W290C PV required a similar and more aggressive approach based on early cephalocranial disproportion. In contrast to previously reported W290C cases , each of our three patients survived and demonstrate normal neurocognitive functioning. While previously reported outcomes in W290C-associated Pfeiffer syndrome<disease> have been extremely poor , we present three patients who underwent an intensive surgical approach and have normal development. This suggests that a personalized and aggressive surgical approach for children with W290C PV may dramatically improve clinical outcome.
