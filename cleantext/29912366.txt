  Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) is a progressive disease. Obesity is associated with progression of AF. This study evaluates the impact of weight and risk factor management ( RFM) on progression of the AF. As described in the Long-Term Effect of Goal-Directed Weight Management in an Atrial<symptom><symptom> Fibrillation<symptom> Cohort: A Long-Term Follow-Up ( LEGACY) Study , of 1415 consecutive AF patients , 825 had body mass index ≥ 27 kg/m2 and were offered weight and RFM. After exclusion , 355 were included for analysis. Weight<symptom> loss<symptom> was categorized as: Group 1 ( < 3 %) , Group 2 ( 3-9 %) , and Group 3 ( ≥ 10 %). Change in AF type was determined by clinical review and 7-day Holter yearly. Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> type was categorized as per the Heart<symptom> Rhythm<symptom> Society consensus. There were no differences in baseline characteristic or follow-up duration between groups ( P = NS). In Group 1 , 41 % progressed from paroxysmal to persistent and 26 % from persistent to paroxysmal or no AF. In Group 2 , 32 % progressed from paroxysmal to persistent and 49 % reversed from persistent to paroxysmal or no AF. In Group 3 , 3 % progressed to persistent and 88 % reversed from persistent to paroxysmal or no AF ( P < 0.001). Increased weight<symptom> loss<symptom> was significantly associated with greater AF freedom: 45 ( 39 %) in Group 1 , 69 ( 67 %) in Group 2 , and 116 ( 86 %) in Group 3 ( P ≤ 0.001). Obesity is associated with progression of the AF disease. This study demonstrates the dynamic relationship between weight/risk factors and AF. Weight-loss management and RFM reverses the type and natural progression of AF.
