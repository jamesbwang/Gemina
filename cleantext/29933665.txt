  Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens , Zingiberis Rhizoma , ginger juice , Zingiberis Rhizoma Praeparatum and roasted ginger are derived from the rhizome of Zingiber officinale. They are commonly used herbs in clinical application , but their processing methods are completely different , leading to different properties and flavors , meridian distributions , and efficacy characteristics from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM). In order to distinguish the clinical applications of different processed gingers , it 's advisable to learn from Treatise on Febrile and Miscellaneous Diseases. Almost half of the prescriptions in the book contain Zingiber officinale , involving Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens , Zingiberis Rhizoma , ginger juice , Zingiberis Rhizoma Praeparatum and other species. In addition , many researches have confirmed that the contents of chemical compositions contained in different processed gingers were not exactly the same , and their pharmacological effects were also different , thus their applications could not be confused. However , physicians often encounter drug shortage or improper processing in clinical practice , contributing to the current chaotic use of different processed gingers. Therefore , this paper aims at sorting out the sources , processing methods , and chemical compositions , comparing their properties , flavors , meridian distributions , and pharmacological effects , and summarizing the efficacy characteristics and application rules in TCM theory of different processed products , with the hope to provide theoretical foundations for their reasonable use.
