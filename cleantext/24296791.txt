  Because specialty care accounts for half of Medicare expenditures , improving its value is critical to the success of Medicare accountable care organizations ( ACOs) in curbing spending growth. However , whether ACOs have reduced low-value specialty care without compromising use of high-value services remains unknown. Using national Medicare data , we identified 2 cohorts: beneficiaries for whom the value of coronary revascularization is lower ( those with ischemic heart disease without angina , congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , or recent admission for acute myocardial infarction) and beneficiaries for whom its value is higher ( those with recent acute myocardial infarction admission). We then determined the provider groups who cared for the cohorts , distinguishing between those participating ( n = 298) and those not participating in a Medicare ACO ( 1329). After measuring the provider groups ' use of coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention among the 2 cohorts , we fit multivariable models to test the statistical significance of rates of change in low- and high-value revascularization after ACO participation. During the pre-ACO period , participating and nonparticipating provider groups had similar rates of low- and high-value revascularization. Our multivariable model results show that rates of change for low- and high-value coronary revascularization were not altered by a provider group 's participation in a Medicare ACO ( lower value: difference , -0.04 per year; 95 % confidence interval , -0.11 to 0.03; higher value: difference , 0.96 per year; 95 % confidence interval , -0.46 to 2.4). We found no association between provider group participation in a Medicare ACO and use of low- or high-value coronary revascularization.
