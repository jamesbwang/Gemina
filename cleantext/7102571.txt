  This article presents data on genes associated with cleft palate ( CP) , retrieved through both a full-text systematic review and a mouse genome informatics ( MGI) database search. In order to group CP-associated genes according to function , pathway , biological process , and cellular component , the genes were analyzed using category enrichment bioinformatics tools , the Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG) and Gene Ontology ( GO). This approach provides invaluable opportunities for the identification of candidate pathways and genes in CP research.
