  This article presents a case study of a female patient with primary immunodeficiency , who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotripsy. The presence of a serious concomitant disease affects different aspects of preoperative and postoperative management of the patient. The choice of percutaneous nephrolithotripsy is necessitated by the need to render the patient stone free using a one-stage and the most effective surgical modality. The article describes the choice of antibacterial therapy to treat inflammatory complications in this category of patients. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used to prevent the onset of pyelonephritis<disease> , while pyelonephritis<disease> exacerbation requires administration of reserve antibiotics in combination with human immunoglobulin.
