  It is still unclear whether toll-like receptor ( TLR) signaling and serum levels of inflammatory markers in metabolically unhealthy abdominally obese ( MUAO) are due to their obesity and/or their metabolic state. We hypothesized that abdominal obesity is an important mediator of the association of metabolic state with TLR signaling and serum inflammatory markers. Therefore , in this case-control study , we compared the expression levels of TLR4 and Toll/interleukin -1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein-inducing interferon β ( TRIF) and serum concentrations of interferon β and lipoprotein-binding protein ( LBP) in metabolically healthy abdominally obese ( MHAO) and MUAO individuals. Basal blood samples from 65 abdominally obese subjects with waist circumference ( WC) of at least 95 cm were collected to determine serum metabolic parameters , IFNβ , and LBP. Those with 3 or more metabolic alterations were defined as MUAO ( n = 34) , and those having 2 or less were classified as MHAO ( n = 31). Furthermore , messenger RNA ( mRNA) was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. TLR4 and TRIF gene expression assay was performed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. There were significant differences in serum fasting blood sugar ( P = .017) , triglyceride ( P < .001) , cholesterol ( P = .002) , and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( P = .034) between the MUAO and MHAO groups , whereas no significant difference was observed in the expression ratio of TLR4 and TRIF mRNA and serum levels of IFNβ and LBP. However , a significant correlation was noticed between mRNA expression levels of TLR4 and TRIF ( r = 0.50 , P < .001) and serum IFNβ and LBP ( r = 0.70 , P < .001). It is concluded that the expression levels of TLR4 and TRIF as well as serum IFNβ and LBP are more related to abdominal obesity than to metabolic health.
