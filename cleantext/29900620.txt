  Habitat loss and fragmentation often reduce gene flow and genetic diversity in plants by disrupting the movement of pollen and seed. However , direct comparisons of the contributions of pollen vs. seed dispersal to genetic variation in fragmented landscapes are lacking. To address this knowledge gap , we partitioned the genetic diversity contributed by male gametes from pollen sources and female gametes from seed sources within established seedlings of the palm Oenocarpus bataua in forest<disease> fragments and continuous forest<disease> in northwest Ecuador. This approach allowed us to quantify the separate contributions of each of these two dispersal processes to genetic variation. Compared to continuous forest<disease> , fragments had stronger spatial genetic structure , especially among female gametes , and reduced effective population sizes. We found that within and among fragments , allelic diversity was lower and genetic structure higher for female gametes than for male gametes. Moreover , female gametic allelic diversity in fragments decreased with decreasing surrounding forest<disease> cover , while male gametic allelic diversity did not. These results indicate that limited seed dispersal within and among fragments restricts genetic diversity and strengthens genetic structure in this system. Although pollen movement may also be impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation , it nonetheless serves to promote gene flow and diversity within and among fragments. Pollen and seed dispersal play distinctive roles in determining patterns of genetic variation in fragmented landscapes , and maintaining the integrity of both dispersal processes will be critical to managing and conserving genetic variation in the face of continuing habitat loss and fragmentation in tropical landscapes.
