  The α-emitting radionuclide actinium-225 possesses nuclear properties that are highly promising for use in targeted α therapy ( TAT) , a therapeutic strategy that employs α particle emissions to destroy tumors. A key factor , however , that may hinder the clinical use of actinium-225 is the poor understanding of its coordination chemistry , which creates challenges for the development of suitable chelation strategies for this ion. In this article , we provide an overview of the known chemistry of actinium and a summary of the chelating agents that have been explored for use in actinium-225-based TAT. This overview provides a starting point for researchers in the field of TAT to gain an understanding of this valuable therapeutic radionuclide.
