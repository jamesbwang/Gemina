  Gluconobacter oxydans<pathogen> can be efficiently used to produce 3-hydroxypropionic acid ( 3-HP) from 1,3-propanediol ( 1,3-PDO). However , the enzymes involved remain unclear. In this study , transcription analysis of two mutants of strain DSM 2003 , obtained by UV-mutagenesis , revealed that membrane-bound alcohol dehydrogenase ( mADH) and membrane-bound aldehyde dehydrogenase ( mALDH) might be the main enzymes involved. Through deletion and complementation of the genes adhA and aldh , mADH and mALDH were verified as the main enzymes responsible for 3-HP production. Then mALDH was verified as the rate-limiting enzyme in 3-HP production. Since that overexpression of mADH had no effect on 3-HP production , whereas overexpression of mALDH increased 23.6 % 3-HP production. Finally , the 3-HP titer of 45.8 g/L and the highest productivity 1.86 g/L/h were achieved when the two mutants DSM 2003/adhAB and DSM 2003/aldh were mixed at a ratio of 1:2 ( cell density) and used as whole cell catalysts for 3-HP production.
