  To elucidate conditions which cause elevation of the serum ferritin , extent of the elevation in each condition , and clinical relevance of hyperferritinemia in general practice. We retrospectively studied medical records of all patients who had at least one serum ferritin measurement above 500 μg L We studied 1394 patients to identify the etiologies of hyperferritinemia. Median serum ferritin level was 1024 μg L Patients with hyperferritinemia frequently had multiple conditions. The level of the serum ferritin was determined by the underlying conditions to a certain extent; however , the variation was significant. While patients with marked hyperferritinemia mostly had multiple underlying causes , various diseases could cause hyperferritinemia by themselves. Hyperferritinemia is associated with both etiology and the number of underlying causes.
