  Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS) is a common yet under-recognised chronic<disease> inflammatory<disease> disease<disease> of the nose and paranasal sinuses that is classified according to the presence ( CRSwNP) or absence ( CRSsNP) of nasal polyps. This paper reports the methodology and descriptive results of the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network ( GALEN) rhinosinusitis cohort. We established a large CRS cohort within the GALEN consortium ( European FP6 research initiative) to identify inflammatory endotypes , the natural disease course , and its impact on health-related quality of life ( HRQoL). Detailed information on the impact of CRS on HRQoL , comorbidity incidence , objective disease measures , and medical and surgical treatments were collected. This multicentre cross-sectional case-control study recruited 935 adults ( 869 eligible for analysis: 237 CRSsNP; 445 CRSwNP; 187 controls ( reference group)). Comorbidities such as asthma , allergy , eczema<disease> , food allergy , urticaria , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were significantly more frequent in CRS patients. Nasal corticosteroids , antibiotics , and oral corticosteroids were the most common treatments. Significantly more CRSwNP patients reported previous sinonasal surgery. This study provides detailed information that facilitates studying CRS and its main phenotypes. However , patient distribution of this study does not necessarily reflect disease distribution in the general population.
