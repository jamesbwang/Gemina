  The prevalence , presentation , management , and prognosis of coronary heart disease differ according to sex. Greater understanding on the differences between men and women with acute aortic dissection ( AAD) is needed. We aimed to investigate whether sex disparities are found in patients with AAD , and to study sex differences in complications , mortality in-hospital , and long-term. We included 884 patients enrolled in our institute between June 2002 and May 2016. Considering psychosocial factors , treatments , and the outcomes in men versus those in women with AAD , we explored the association of sex with psychosocial characteristics and mortality risk. For categorical variables , significant differences between groups were assessed with the Chi-square test or Fisher 's exact test , and continuous parameters were assessed with Student 's t-test. Univariate and stratified survival statistics were computed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. A total of 884 patients ( 76.1 % male , mean age 51.4 ± 11.8 years) were included in this study. There were fewer current smokers in female compared with male ( 17.5 % vs. 67.2 % , χ In Chinese with AAD , sex is not independently associated with long-term clinical outcomes. Age , the intake of calcium-channel blockers at discharge might help to improve long-term outcomes.
