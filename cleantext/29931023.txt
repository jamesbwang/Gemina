  Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the self-assembly and friction of glycerol monooleate mixed with oleic acid , glycerol , calcium oleate , or water in n-heptane and toluene solvents. The aim is to determine how chemical degradation products of glycerol monooleate could lead to changes in structural and frictional properties. In bulk solution , almost all mixtures studied contain self-assembled reverse micelles. Under confinement between sheared mica surfaces , the reverse micelles disintegrate , but the distribution of molecules between the surfaces and the centre of the fluid layer depends sensitively on the chemical composition , with more polar mixtures showing stronger adsorption. The measured kinetic friction coefficient is correlated with the extent of surface adsorption: while degradation products lead to increases in the friction coefficient in most cases , all changes are more pronounced when there is less surface adsorption.
