  To investigate the association between domains of nutrition risk with hospitalisations and mortality for New Zealand Māori and non-Māori in advanced age. Within LiLACS NZ , 256 Māori and 399 non-Māori octogenarians were assessed for nutrition risk using the Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition ( SCREEN II) questionnaire according to three domains of risk. Sociodemographic and health characteristics were established. Five years from inception , survival analyses examined associations between nutrition risk from the three domains of SCREEN II with all-cause hospital admissions and mortality. For Māori but not non-Māori , lower nutrition risk in the Dietary Intake domain was associated with reduced hospitalisations and mortality ( Hazard Ratios ( HR) ( 95 % CI) 0.97 ( 0.95-0.99) , p = 0.009 and 0.91 ( 0.86-0.98) , p = 0.005 , respectively). The ` Factors Affecting Intake ' domain was associated with mortality ( HR , ( 95 % CI) 0.94 ( 0.89-1.00) , p = 0.048) , adjusted for age , gender , socioeconomic deprivation , education , previous hospital admissions , comorbidities and activities of daily living. Improved dietary adequacy may reduce poor outcomes for older Māori. Implications for public health: Nutrition risk among older Māori is identifiable and treatable. Effort is needed to engage relevant community and whānau ( family) support to ensure older Māori have food security and cultural food practices are met.
