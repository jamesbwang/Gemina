  Several studies show that mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) homing to tumors not only provide the microenvironment for tumor cells but also promote tumor growth and metastasis. However , the exact mechanism remains unclear. Our study aims to investigate the role of gastric cancer MSCs ( GCMSCs)- derived IL15 during GC progression. The effects of IL15 secreted by GCMSCs on GC development were evaluated by detecting the stemness , epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) , and migration abilities of GC cell lines. The expression of IL15 in serum and tissues of GC patients was also assessed. We found that IL15 derived from GCMSCs enhanced stemness , induced EMT and promoted migration of GC cell lines. The level of IL15 was higher in GC patients both in serum and tissues compared with that in healthy donors , which was associated with lymph node metastasis. In addition , the results have shown that IL15 in GC microenvironment was mainly produced by GCMSCs. Moreover , IL15 upregulated Tregs ratio through activation of STAT5 in CD4
