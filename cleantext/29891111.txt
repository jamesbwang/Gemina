  Lipoxygenases ( LOXs) are dioxygenases that catalyze the peroxidation of linoleic acid ( LA) or arachidonic acid ( AA) , in the presence of molecular oxygen. The existence of inflammatory component in the tumor microenvironment intimately links the LOXs to gastrointestinal ( GI) cancer progression. Amongst the six-different human LOX-isoforms , 5-LOX is the most vital enzyme for leukotriene ( LT) biosynthesis , which is the main inflammation<symptom> intermediaries. As recent investigations have shown the association of 5-LOX with tumor metastasis , there has also been significant progress in discovering the function of 5-LOX pathway in GI cancer. Studies on GI cancer cells using the pharmacological drugs targeting 5-LOX pathway have shown antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. Pharmacogenetic discoveries in other diseases have revealed strong heritable basis for the leukotriene pathway , which helps in exploring the mechanistic source of genetic alteration within the leukotriene pathway and offer insights into GI cancer pathogenesis and future prospects for treatment and prevention. This review recapitulates the current research status of 5-LOX activity in GI malignancies.
