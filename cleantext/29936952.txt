  Dual-energy computed tomography ( DECT) offers several advantages over conventional single-energy CT.. These advantages include improved image quality , beam hardening correction , and metal artifact reduction. Additionally , DECT allows derivation of quantitative information through material decomposition analysis. Although newer third-generation rapid-kilovolt switching and dual-source DECT scanners have significantly improved in image quality and workflow compared with initial iterations and early scanners , sources of potential image quality degradation can exist secondary to the inherent capabilities in which the image acquisition occurs.
