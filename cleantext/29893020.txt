  2D layered materials have emerged in recent years as a new platform to host novel electronic , optical , or excitonic physics and develop unprecedented nanoelectronic and energy applications. By definition , these materials are strongly anisotropic between the basal plane and cross the plane. The structural and property anisotropies inside their basal plane , however , are much less investigated. Black phosphorus , for example , is a 2D material that has such in-plane anisotropy. Here , a rare chemical form of arsenic , called black-arsenic ( b-As) , is reported as a cousin of black phosphorus , as an extremely anisotropic layered semiconductor. Systematic characterization of the structural , electronic , thermal , and electrical properties of b-As single crystals is performed , with particular focus on its anisotropies along two in-plane principle axes , armchair ( AC) and zigzag ( ZZ). The analysis shows that b-As exhibits higher or comparable electronic , thermal , and electric transport anisotropies between the AC and ZZ directions than any other known 2D crystals. Such extreme in-plane anisotropies can potentially implement novel ideas for scientific research and device applications.
