  Psycho-affective states or traits such as stress , depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> and neuroticism are known to affect sleep , cognition and mental health and well-being in aging populations and to be associated with increased risk for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). Mental training for stress reduction and emotional and attentional regulation through meditation practice might help reduce these adverse factors. So far , studies on the impact of meditation practice on brain and cognition in aging are scarce and have limitations but the findings are encouraging , showing a positive effect of meditation training on cognition , especially on attention and memory , and on brain structure and function especially in frontal and limbic structures and insula. In line with this , we showed in a pilot study that gray matter volume and/or glucose metabolism was higher in six older adult expert meditators compared to 67 age-matched controls in the prefrontal , anterior and posterior cingulate cortex , insula and temporo-parietal junction. These preliminary findings are important in the context of reserve and brain maintenance as they suggest that long-term meditation practice might help preserve brain structure and function from progressive age-related decline. Further studies are needed to confirm these results with larger samples and in randomized controlled trials and to investigate the mechanisms underlying these meditation-related effects. The European Commission-funded project Silver Santé Study will address these challenges by studying 316 older adults including 30 expert meditators and 286 meditation-naïve participants ( either cognitively normal or with subjective cognitive decline). Two randomized controlled trials will be conducted to assess the effects of 2-month and 18-month meditation , English learning or health education training programs ( versus a passive control) on behavioral , sleep , blood sampling and neuroimaging measures. This European research initiative illustrates the progressive awareness of the benefit of such non-pharmacological approaches in the prevention of dementia and the relevance of taking into account the psycho-affective dimension in endeavoring to improve mental health and well-being of older adults.
