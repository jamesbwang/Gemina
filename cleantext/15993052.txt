  This review ( with 85 refs.) summarizes the recent literature on the adsorption of common aromatic pollutants by using modified metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs). Four kinds of aromatic pollutants are discussed , namely benzene homologues , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) , organic dyes and their intermediates , and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ( PPCPs). MOFs are shown to be excellent adsorbents that can be employed to both the elimination of pollutants and to their extraction and quantitation. Adsorption mechanisms and interactions between aromatic pollutants and MOFs are discussed. Finally , the actual challenges of existence and the perspective routes towards future improvements in the field are addressed. Graphical abstract Recent advance on adsorption of common aromatic pollutants including benzene series , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , organic dyes and their intermediates , pharmaceuticals and personal care products by metal-organic frameworks.
