  In vascular tissue engineering , great attention is paid to the immobilization of biomolecules onto synthetic grafts to increase bio- and hemocompatibility-two critical milestones in the field. The surface modification field of poly ( ethylene terephthalate) ( PET) , a well-known vascular-graft material , is matured and oversaturated. Nevertheless , most developed methods are laborious multistep procedures generally accompanied by coating instability or toxicity issues. Herein , a straightforward surface modification procedure is presented engineered to simultaneously promote surface endothelialization and anticoagulation properties via the covalent immobilization of gelatin through a photoactivated azide derivative. A complete physicochemical characterization and biological study including cytotoxicity and endotoxin testing are performed. In addition , biocompatibility toward small ( diameter ≤ 6 mm) and/or large caliber ( diameter ≥ 6 mm) vessels is assessed by micro- and macrovascular endothelial cell assays. Superior bio- and hemocompatibility properties are seen for the gelatin-covalently modified PET surfaces compared to the conventional surface-modification procedures based on physisorption.
