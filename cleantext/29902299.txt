  Dual anti-HER2 blockade increased the rate of pathologic complete response ( pCR) in the Neoadjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimisation ( NeoALTTO) trial , and high immune gene expression was associated with pCR in all treatment arms. So far , no marker has been identified that is specifically associated with the benefit from dual HER2 blockade. To examine if use of the T-cell β chain variable genes adds to the potential association of immune gene signatures with response to dual HER2 blockade. In the NeoALTTO trial , HER2-positive patients recruited between January 5 , 2008 , and May 27 , 2010 , were treated with paclitaxel plus either lapatinib or trastuzumab or both as neoadjuvant therapy. In this study , RNA sequencing data from baseline tumor specimens of 245 patients in the NeoALTTO trial were analyzed and reads were aligned to TRBV gene reference sequences using a previously published Basic Local Alignment Search Tool T-cell receptor mapping pipeline. Total TRBV gene use , Shannon entropy , and gene richness were calculated for each tumor , and nonnegative matrix factorization was used to define TRBV co-use metagenes ( TMGs). The association between TRBV metrics , tumor genomic metrics , and response was assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Statistical analysis was performed from January 23 to December 2 , 2017. The association between TRBV use metrics and pCR. Among the 245 women with available data ( mean ( SD) age , 49 ( 11) years) , total TRBV use correlated positively with a gene expression signature for immune activity ( Spearman ρ = 0.93; P < .001). High use of TRBV11-3 and TMG2 , characterized by high use of TRBV4 .3 , TRBV6 .3 , and TRBV7 .2 , was associated with a higher rate of pCR to dual HER2-targeted therapy ( TRBV11-3 interaction: odds ratio , 2.63 ( 95 % CI , 1.22-6.47); P = .02; TMG2 interaction: odds ratio , 3.39 ( 95 % CI , 1.57-8.27); P = .004). Immune-rich cancers with high TMG2 levels ( n = 92) had significantly better response to dual HER2-targeted treatment compared with the single therapy arms ( rate of pCR , 68 % ( 95 % CI , 52 % -83 %) vs 21 % ( 95 % CI , 10 % -31 %); P < .001) , whereas those with low TMG2 levels did not benefit from dual therapy. High TMG2 levels were also associated with a higher rate of pCR to the combined therapy in immune-poor tumors ( n = 30; pCR , 50 % ( 95 % CI , 22 % -78 %) vs 6 % ( 95 % CI , 0 % -16 %); P = .009). Use patterns of TRBV genes potentially provide information about the association with response to dual HER2 blockade beyond immune gene signatures. High use of TRBV11 .3 or TRBV4 .3 , TRBV6 .3 , and TRBV7 .2 identifies patients who have a better response to dual HER2 targeted therapy. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00553358.
