  This study investigated the effect of telephone-supported ergonomic education on pregnancy-related low back pain. This study was performed at Trakya University Hospital in Edirne , Turkey between December 15 , 2016 and April 4 , 2017. One hundred ten pregnant women were included in the study and randomly assigned to one of two groups. Sixty pregnant women received one face-to-face session of ergonomic education followed by three weekly sessions of telephone-supported ergonomic education ( intervention group). Fifty pregnant women received only one session of standard face-to-face ergonomic education. Before and after the intervention , low back pain was evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale. Pain-related disability was evaluated with the Oswestry Disability Index , and health-related quality of life was evaluated with the SF-36. Telephone-supported ergonomic education was more effective than standard ergonomic education and can be used as an effective solution for pregnancy-related low back pain.
