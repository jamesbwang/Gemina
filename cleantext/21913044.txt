  We undertook a comparative survey of gastric emptying ( GE) kinetics after two variants of bypass surgery for upper bowel obstruction. In 10 dogs with experimental upper bowel obstruction , five were randomized to obtain gastrojejunal anastomosis ( GA) , and the other five received Roux-en-Y duodenojejunal anastomosis ( DA). Duplicate scintigraphic measurements of GE of a solid meal were accomplished in every animal before surgery and during the early ( 2-3 weeks) , medium ( 3 months) , and late ( 6 months) post-operative period. The GE curves were fitted with a power-exponential function to derive the GE half time T 1/2 , and the curve shape parameter S. Early after surgery T 1/2 slightly decreased by -18 ± 21 min in the DA group and lengthened by 91 ± 37 min in the GA group ( p = 0.042). In both groups an increase in the S parameter was found then. In either group T 1/2 gradually declined towards the basal value during the medium and late post-operative period. On the other hand , net differences relative to the basal situation in the S values appeared to be positive in the GA group ( 0.32 ± 0.11 at 3 months; 0.64 ± 0.19 at six months) , and negative in the DA group ( -0.30 ± 0.09 at 3 months; -0.01 ± 0.20 at six months). Hence a statistically significant contrast was found between those differences: p = 0.0022 at 3 months , and p = 0.045 at six months after the surgery. Roux-en-Y duodenojejunal anastomosis appears to be superior to the classical gastrojejunal anastomosis while restoring patency of the gastrointestinal passage in the case of upper bowel obstruction.
