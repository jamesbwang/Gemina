  Protein phosphorylation is an abundant molecular switch that regulates a multitude of cellular processes. In contrast to other subfamilies of phosphoprotein phosphatases , the PPEF subfamily is only poorly investigated. Drosophila retinal degeneration C ( RDGC) constitutes the founding member of the PPEF subfamily. RDGC dephosphorylates the visual pigment rhodopsin and the ion channel TRP.However , rdgC null mutant flies exhibit rhodopsin and TRP hyperphosphorylation , altered photoreceptor physiology , and retinal degeneration. Here , we report the identification of a third RDGC protein variant and show that the three RDGC isoforms harbor different N-termini that determine solubility and subcellular targeting due to fatty acylation. Taken together , solubility and subcellular targeting of RDGC splice variants are determined by their N-termini.
