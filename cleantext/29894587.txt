  Endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs) may allow accelerated and functional endothelialization of stents , theoretically reducing late stent complications as well reducing the duration of DAPT. In a pilot study of 193 patients at high risk of target vessel failure ( TVF) , the Genous EPC capturing stent ( ESC) and TAXUS Libert√© paclitaxel-eluting second-generation stent ( PES) were similar at 5-years. Events rates appear higher for ESC within the first-year followed by higher rate of complications for PES during years 2-5. A larger randomized multi-center trials powered for non-inferiority of ECS to PES is underway.
