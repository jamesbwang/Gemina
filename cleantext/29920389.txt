  Despite its growing popularity , no comparative studies have explored the minimum clinically important difference ( MCID) of health-related quality of life scores following lumbar interbody fusion ( LIF) performed on a single-level adult low-grade isthmic spondylolisthesis ( LGIS). The purpose of this study is to investigate factors related to MCID of health-related quality of life scores following instrumented LIF performed on a single-level adult LGIS. Consecutive patients who underwent instrumented LIF for single-level LGIS were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were adult patients who underwent L4-5 or L5-S1 , underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion or transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with a posterior screw fixation , and had a minimum 36-month postoperative follow-up period. MCID was defined as having an improved score of visual analog scale ( VAS) back and leg<symptom> pain<symptom> > 3 and Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI) > 12. Patients were subdivided into groups named `` achievement '' ( A) and `` nonachievement '' ( N) depending on their postoperative MCID for each health-related quality of life score category. One-hundred and five patients met the inclusion criteria. The overall achievement of MCID for VAS back , leg , and ODI was 80 % , 73.3 % , and 82.9 %. MCID-VAS leg and ODI were less achieved at the L5-S1 level than at the L4-5 level. Postoperatively , disk height was higher and segmental lordosis ( SL) was lower in group A of MCID-VAS leg. SL was lower in group A of MCID-ODI. We postulate that excessive SL does not affect lumbar lordosis; rather , it can result in lowering posterior disk height. The decrease in posterior DH may lead to a decreased foraminal height that , in turn , can lead to nerve root compression. Proper restoration of disk height and bone fusion is more important than restoration of more segmental lordosis or slip reduction for isthmic spondylolisthesis.
