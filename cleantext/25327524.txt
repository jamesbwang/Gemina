  Side effects are the second and the fourth leading causes of drug attrition and death in the US. Thus , accurate prediction of side effects and understanding their mechanism of action will significantly impact drug discovery and clinical practice. Here , we show REMAP , a neighborhood-regularized weighted and imputed one-class collaborative filtering algorithm , is effective in predicting drug-side effect associations from a drug-side effect association network , and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-target learning algorithm for predicting rare side effects. We also apply FASCINATE , an extension of REMAP for multi-layered networks , to infer associations among side effects and drug targets from drug-target-side effect networks. Then , using random permutation analysis and gene overrepresentation tests , we infer statistically significant side effect-pathway associations. The predicted drug-side effect associations and side effect-causing pathways are consistent with clinical evidences. We expect more novel drug-side effect associations and side effect-causing pathways to be identified when applying REMAP and FASCINATE to large-scale chemical-gene-side effect networks.
