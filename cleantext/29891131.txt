  A common technique for fixation of rotational fibular fractures is to use an interfragmentary compression screw with a laterally positioned neutralization plate. The objective of the present investigation was to examine the anatomic feasibility of distal fibula bicortical fixation within this plating technique. A specific screw insertion technique was performed through a laterally positioned one-third tubular plate on a consecutive series of 81 intact cadaveric ankle mortises. The most distal plate hole was drilled , aimed 10 ° posterior to the midline of the fibula. The second-most distal plate hole was drilled , aimed 25 ° superiorly. The specimens were then dissected , and the screw termini were physically examined for whether they had penetrated the articular cartilage of the ankle mortise. The length of the most distal bicortical screw measured a mean ± standard deviation of 20.44 ± 2.49 ( range 14 to 26) mm , with an extra-articular terminus in 95.06 % of specimens. The length of the second-most distal bicortical screw measured a mean ± standard deviation of 19.68 ± 3.02 ( range 12 to 28) mm , with an extra-articular terminus in 100 % of the specimens. The results of the present study provide evidence that bicortical distal fibular fixation in accordance with basic fixation principles is anatomically possible and feasible with a one-third tubular plate. This could potentially obviate the need for more expensive fixation options ( i.e. , locked plates or anatomically contoured plates) and fixation options that are biomechanically stable but potentially anatomically impeding ( i.e. , posterior antiglide plating).
