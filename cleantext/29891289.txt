  A thermo and pH dual-responsive starch ( TPDS) was successfully synthesized by etherification , in which butyl glycidyl ether ( BGE) was used as the hydrophobic reagent followed by addition of 2-chloro-4 , 6-diglycino- ( 1,3,5)- triazine ( CDT) groups. The obtained materials were characterized by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR) ,
