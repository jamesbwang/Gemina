  The aim of this study was to examine this association between maternal weight during pregnancy and the incidence of hospitalisations for infectious<disease> diseases<disease> during early childhood. A population-based cohort study. A national cohort was created by combining data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register , the National Inpatient Register , the Cause of Death Register , the Total Population Register and the Longitudinal integration database for health insurance and labour market studies. 693007 children born in Sweden between 1998 and 2006. Number of hospitalisations for infectious<disease> diseases<disease> during the first 5 years of life , overall and for categories of infectious<disease> diseases<disease> ( lower respiratory , enteric , upper respiratory , genitourinary , perinatal , skin and soft tissue , neurological and eye , digestive tract , bloodstream and other infections). Overweight ( body mass index ( BMI) 25.0-29.9) and obesity ( BMI â‰¥ 30) during pregnancy were associated with a higher overall incidence of hospitalisations for infectious<disease> diseases<disease> , adjusted incidence rate ratio ( IRR) 1.05 ( 95 % CI 1.03 to 1.06) and adjusted IRR 1.18 ( 95 % CI 1.16 to 1.21). Overweight and obesity during pregnancy were strongly associated with perinatal infections , adjusted IRR 1.34 ( 95 % CI 1.25 to 1.44) and adjusted IRR 1.72 ( 95 % CI 1.57 to 1.88). In contrast , we found no association between maternal weight during pregnancy and infections of skin and soft tissue , the nervous system , the digestive tract or the bloodstream. We observed an association between overweight and obesity during pregnancy , and hospitalisations for infectious<disease> diseases<disease> during early childhood.
