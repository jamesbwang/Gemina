  Since the extension of the St√∂ber method traditionally used in the synthesis of silica nanoparticles into the fabrication of resorcinol-formaldehyde nanospheres in 2011 , significant progresses have been achieved in this exiting area of nano-resole-enabled synthesis of elegant nanostructures with versatile compositions and promising applications in various fields. To date , there are few reviews focused on this topic. In this minireview , we aim to provide an overview on recent developments , with the emphasis on nano-resoles as an enabling strategy in the synthesis of innovative materials. The history of nano-resoles and their distinct roles classified into four functions will be introduced. Clear understanding into this research field is vital for achieving rational design and controllable synthesis of a new generation of nano-resoles and their derived nanostructures.
