  Nano-scale spatial confinement can alter chemistry at mineral-water interfaces. These nano-scale confinement effects can lead to anomalous fate and transport behavior of aqueous metal species. When a fluid resides in a nanoporous environments ( pore size under 100 nm) , the observed density , surface tension , and dielectric constant diverge from those measured in the bulk. To evaluate the impact of nano-scale confinement on the adsorption of copper ( Cu
