  Pancreatic endoscopic sphincterotomy ( PES) is an independent risk factor for short- and long-term adverse events ( AEs) of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. We sought to measure PES-specific AEs and trends in the use of PES. This was a retrospective cohort of consecutive patients who underwent first-time PES between June 2008 and June 2015. Indications for PES were dichotomized: ( 1) structural pathology ( chronic pancreatitis<disease> and local complications of acute pancreatitis<disease> and ( 2) suspected sphincter pathology ( idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis<disease> and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction). Rates of AEs and pancreatic orifice reinterventions were measured , with reintervention rates limited to those having a minimum of 12-month follow-up. Of 567 patients , 198 ( 34.9 %) underwent PES for structural and 369 ( 65.1 %) for suspected sphincter pathology. Rates of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis<disease> and unplanned hospitalization were high when PES was originally performed for suspected sphincter pathology ( 12.6 % and 14.6 % , respectively). The overall reintervention rate was 28.9 % and significantly greater for sphincter ( 41.7 %) compared with structural pathology ( 13.5 % , P = 0.005). The likelihood of reintervention after PES is high , particularly when the primary indication is suspected sphincter pathology such as idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis<disease> Further prospective studies are needed to clarify if and when this maneuver confers significant benefit to patients.
