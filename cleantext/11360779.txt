  This study is aimed at determining , through a cross-sectional study , the preferred therapeutic method in Brazil considering the approach to Gartland type II and III supracondylar humerus fractures during childhood. The research project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Plataforma Brasil and the material was collected during the 46th Brazilian Orthopedics and Traumatology Congress. A questionnaire was developed to analyze two clinical scenarios about Gartland type II and III fractures. The sample consisted of 301 questionnaires obtained from 5500 participants of the Congress who met the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria. In case 1 , the following was observed: 140 ( 46.5 %) of physicians opted for closed reduction with immobilization and 116 ( 38.5 %) selected closed reduction and osteosynthesis , of whom 82 ( 70.7 %) preferred two crossed Kirschner wires. In case 2 , 294 ( 97.7 %) considered that the treatment is urgent , and 225 ( 74.8 %) of the interviewed orthopedists answered that they perform osteosynthesis with two crossed Kirschner wires. The opinion of orthopedic surgeons in Brazil varies for Gartland type II fractures. Type III fractures have a uniform conduct and they are treated urgently ( 97.7 %). When osteosynthesis is necessary , it was observed that 82 ( 70.7 %) and 225 ( 74.8 %) of the interviewed surgeons opted for fixation with two crossed Kirschner wires.
