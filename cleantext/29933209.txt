  There is an elevated prevalence of anxiety<symptom> disorders among people with epilepsy , and the comorbidity of anxiety<symptom> in epilepsy is associated with adverse medical and psychosocial outcomes. Despite its importance , little is known about what psychosocial or epilepsy factors may be associated with the development of anxiety<symptom>. The aim of this qualitative study was to determine what factors may explain why some people with epilepsy develop anxiety<symptom> disorders and others do not. Adults with epilepsy were recruited from an outpatient epilepsy service. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 26 participants , 15 of whom reported clinically significant levels of anxiety<symptom>. Grounded theory analysis was used to develop a theoretical model of anxiety<symptom> development in the context of epilepsy. Qualitative analyses revealed a number of processes that appeared to account for the development of anxiety<symptom> in the context of epilepsy. These included inflated estimates regarding epilepsy-specific risks and excessive attempts to avoid these risks. Such excessive avoidance often resulted in greater interference with participants ' role functioning , thus risking ongoing quality of life. A number of premorbid and contextual factors also appear to be implicated in the development of anxiety<symptom>. This investigation provides a comprehensive account for the development of anxiety<symptom> in epilepsy , which is consistent with existing theories of anxiety<symptom> development and maintenance. Importantly , this model provides a foundation for future research and appropriate treatment strategies to address anxiety<symptom> in people with epilepsy.
