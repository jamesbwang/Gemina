  The genetics of individual lipid species and their relevance in disease is largely unresolved. We profiled a subset of storage , signaling , membrane , and mitochondrial liver lipids across 385 mice from 47 strains of the BXD mouse population fed chow or high-fat diet and integrated these data with complementary multi-omics datasets. We identified several lipid species and lipid clusters with specific phenotypic and molecular signatures and , in particular , cardiolipin species with signatures of healthy and fatty liver. Genetic analyses revealed quantitative trait loci for 68 % of the lipids ( lQTL). By multi-layered omics analyses , we show the reliability of lQTLs to uncover candidate genes that can regulate the levels of lipid species. Additionally , we identified lQTLs that mapped to genes associated with abnormal lipid metabolism in human GWASs. This work provides a foundation and resource for understanding the genetic regulation and physiological significance of lipid species.
