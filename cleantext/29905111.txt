  Words rated for their survival relevance are remembered better than when rated using other well-known memory mnemonics. This finding , which is known as the survival advantage effect and has been replicated in many studies , suggests that our memory systems are molded by natural selection pressures. In two experiments , the present study used a visual search task to examine whether there is likewise a survival advantage for our visual systems. Participants rated words for their survival relevance or for their pleasantness before locating that object 's picture in a search array with 8 or 16 objects. Although there was no difference in search times among the two rating scenarios when set size was 8 , survival processing reduced visual search times when set size was 16. These findings reflect a search efficiency effect and suggest that similar to our memory systems , our visual systems are also tuned toward self-preservation.
