  The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 alpha regulatory subunit 1 gene ( PIK3R1) encodes the PIK3R1 protein , which plays a direct role in insulin signaling. PIK3R1 ( p85 regulatory subunit) connects firmly with the p110 catalytic subunit , and together these proteins form the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K) protein. PI3K is a key protein in the Akt signaling pathway , which regulates cell survival , growth , differentiation , glucose trafficking , and utilization. Defects in the insulin signaling cascade play an important role in the development of insulin resistance , which shares a common genetic basis for metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes ( T2D) , obesity and cardiovascular diseases. In our study , we investigated the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) rs3756668 in 3 ` UTR region , rs706713 and rs3730089 in exons 1 and 6 , respectively , rs7713645 and rs7709243 in intron 1 , and rs1550805 in intron 6 of PIK3R1 gene on T2D. This study enrolled a total of 840 individuals , including 427 diabetic individuals ( 206 obese and 221 non-obese) and 413 nondiabetic individuals ( 138 obese and 275 non-obese). The target SNPs were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS18 .0 ( IBM Corp. , Armonk , USA). The p-values â‰¤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The SNPs rs706713 ( Tyr73Tyr) and rs3730089 ( Met326Ile) located in exons , and rs7713645 , rs7709243 and rs1550805 located in introns were determined to be significantly associated with T2D and phenotypic features such as obesity , insulin resistance and the lipid parameters. The association with SNP rs3756668 , which is located in the 3 ` UTR , was not significant. Our study supports the role of PIK3R1 , an important candidate gene due to its critical role in insulin signal transduction , in T2D development.
