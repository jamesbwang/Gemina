  Motor skill competence enables children to move with efficiency and confidence in a variety of physically challenging situations. A child who lacks motor skill competence may be less inclined to take part in physical activities in which his or her peers excel. In this regard , the development of motor competence and children & rsquo; s perception of their motor abilities may play an important role in ensuring sufficiently physically active adults. To better understand the role of motor competence in children & rsquo; s participation in physical activity , this study examined children & rsquo; s perception of their motor competence in comparison to others with their actual motor competence. Data were collected from 1031 children in grades 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 and between the ages of 8 to 12 years from elementary and junior schools. Using the Canadian Assessment of Physical Literacy ( CAPL) protocols , physical competence and perceived physical competence were obtained from the Canadian Agility and Movement Skill Assessment and the CAPL questionnaire , respectively. Results from this study support previous research as children & rsquo; s ability to accurately perceive their motor competence increased with age/grade. Still , over half of the participants in this study were not able to accurately perceive their motor competence. In addition , as grade increased from 3 to 6 , children over-estimated their abilities less and underestimated their abilities more. This lack of ability to accurately estimate their abilities may be impacting children & rsquo; s level of physical activity and should be addressed when promoting physical activity.
