  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is an anxiety<symptom> disorder with prolonged distortion of rational behavior. In this study , we report the preclinical potential of olanzapine ( OLZ) in the treatment of PTSD. Since the atypical antipsychotics have modulating effects on cell protective and destructive factors , we tested the effects of OLZ in PTSD regarding these cell modulating factors. Rats , when subjected to stress-restress ( SRS) model of PTSD , showed a derangement in cell protective factors like the decline in BDNF , ERK , and CREB. While the adversarial factors like caspase-3 were enhanced. Four weeks treatment with OLZ at doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg significantly mitigated the SRS-induced derangement related to PTSD. OLZ at doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg enhanced BDNF , ERK and CREB levels which were reduced by SRS in PTSD animals. Further , at the fore mentioned doses it also inhibited the elevation of caspase-3 a downstream apoptotic factor. Besides , OLZ also showed mitigation in behavioral alterations related to anxiety<symptom> and memory brought about by PTSD. These effects of OLZ were comparable to that of paroxetine a clinically approved drug for PTSD in terms of biochemical and behavioral assessments indicating its anti-PTSD potential.
