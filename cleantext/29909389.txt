  We report the case of a 46-year-old woman who had presented with left-sided abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> 21 days after undergoing a left-sided laparoscopic nephrectomy for donation. Initial haemoglobin and haematocrit levels were within normal range , and vital signs on admission were unremarkable. Significant intra-abdominal pathology was not suspected; however , inpatient CT scan of the abdomen showed a posterolateral subcapsular splenic haematoma with free abdominal fluid. Initial trial of conservative management was not successful as the patient became hypotensive on the third day of admission with a sudden decrease in haemoglobin and haematocrit. The patient was immediately taken to theatre for laparotomy and splenectomy. Recovery was uneventful and was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day. In this article , we aim to discuss several important clinical lessons involving iatrogenic injury of the spleen , its management , and diagnosis of acute and severe haemorrhage.
