  Exosomes , the smallest extracellular vesicle , contain various molecules and mediate cell-cell communication. A number of studies demonstrate exosomes are involved in important physiological and pathological processes. Moreover , microRNA ( miRNA) regulating hypertension development through the suppression of certain translation was recently reported. However , roles of exosomes containing various molecules including miRNA on development of essential hypertension have not been examined. We tested the hypothesis that plasma exosomes regulate systemic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR). Normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats ( WKY) and SHR ( 5-10-week-old) were intraperitoneally administrated with exosomes derived from plasma in WKY or SHR weekly for 6 weeks. Exosomes were isolated by an ultracentrifuge method. SHR-derived exosomes significantly increased systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in WKY , while WKY-derived exosomes decreased it in SHR. In WKY , SHR-derived exosomes induced modest structural changes of thoracic aorta , such as wall thickening and decreased abundance of collagen , which were similar to the changes observed in SHR. On the contrary , WKY-derived exosomes tended to reverse the changes in SHR. WKY-derived exosomes significantly suppressed the increased prostaglandin F
