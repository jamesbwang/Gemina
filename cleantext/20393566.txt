  BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of a novel long noncoding RNA ( lncRNA) , LL22NC03-N64E9.1 , and its effect on the phenotype of lung cancer cells and tissues using The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA) RNA sequencing data and other publicly available profiling data. MATERIAL AND METHODS The lung cancer dataset GSE30219 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO) repository. Differentially expressed lncRNA , LL22NC03-N64E9.1 , in 48 lung cancer tissue samples and adjacent normal lung tissues , normal lung cell lines BEAS-2B and A549 , and lung cancer cell lines , H1703 , and H292 , were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) ( qRT-PCR). Interference efficiency was performed using small interfering RNA ( siRNA). Tumor levels of lncRNA , LL22NC03-N64E9.1 , and clinicopathological parameters were statistically analyzed. RESULTS Analysis of the GSE30219 test cohort showed that lncRNA , LL22NC03-N64E9.1 expression was significantly increased in lung cancer. In clinical tissue samples , the level of LL22NC03-N64E9.1 in patients with lung cancer was significantly increased compared with adjacent normal lung tissues ( P < 0.001). The level of LL22NC03-N64E9.1 in patients with lung cancer was significantly correlated with tumor size and TNM stage ( P < 0.05) , but not with age , sex and the presence of lymph node metastasis ( P > 0.05). In the H292 cells , following knockdown of LL22NC03-N64E9.1 , cell proliferation and cloning were reduced. CONCLUSIONS Expression of lncRNA , LL22NC03-N64E9.1 , promoted proliferation of lung cancer cells in vitro , was highly expressed in lung cancer tissues and was associated with increased overall survival ( OS) , tumor size , and tumor stage in patients with lung cancer.
