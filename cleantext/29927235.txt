  The increasing incidence of infections in implantable devices has encouraged the search for biocompatible antimicrobial surfaces. To inhibit the bacterial adhesion and proliferation on biomaterials , several surface functionalization strategies have been developed. However , most of these strategies lead to bacteriostatic effect and only few of these are able to reach the bactericidal condition. In this work , bactericidal surfaces were designed through the functionalization of titanium surfaces with poly-l-lysine ( PLL) as the mediator for the incorporation of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs). This functionalization influences the adsorption of the particles on the substrate impeding the agglomeration observed when bare titanium surfaces are used , leading to a homogeneous distribution of AgNPs on the surfaces. The antimicrobial activity of this surface has been tested against two different strains , namely , Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> For both strains and different AgNPs sizes , the surface modified with PLL and AgNPs shows a much enhanced antimicrobial activity in comparison with AgNPs deposited on bare titanium. This enhanced antibacterial activity is high enough to reach bactericidal effect , a condition hard to achieve in antimicrobial surfaces. Importantly , the designed surfaces are able to decrease the bacterial viability more than 5 orders with respect to the initial bacterial inoculum. That means that a relative low load of AgNPs on the PLL-modified titanium surfaces reaches 99.999 % bacterial death after 24 h. The results of the present study are important to avoid infections in indwelling materials by reinforcing the preventive antibiotic therapy usually dosed throughout the surgical procedure and during the postoperative period.
