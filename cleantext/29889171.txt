  Electronic health records ( EHRs) provide an alternative to traditional public health surveillance surveys and administrative data for measuring the prevalence and impact of chronic health conditions in populations. As the infrastructure for secondary use of EHR data improves , many stakeholders are poised to benefit from data partnerships for regional access to information. Electronic health records can be transformed into a common data model that facilitates data sharing across multiple organizations and allows data to be used for surveillance. The Colorado Health Observation Regional Data Service , a regional distributed data network , has assembled diverse data partnerships , flexible infrastructure , and transparent governance practices to better understand the health of communities through EHR-based , public health surveillance. This article describes attributes of regional distributed data networks using EHR data and the history and design of Colorado Health Observation Regional Data Service as an emerging public health surveillance tool for chronic health conditions. Colorado Health Observation Regional Data Service and our experience may serve as a model for other regions interested in similar surveillance efforts. While benefits from EHR-based surveillance are described , a number of technology , partnership , and value proposition challenges remain.
