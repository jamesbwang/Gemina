  In this case study , we describe our experiences with a rural poor family from north India that initially contacted faith healers for treatment of their child who was having symptoms suggestive of epilepsy , but the seizures<symptom> continued even after this. The family migrated to a city , where they started allopathic treatment , but eventually they had to discontinue it as there was no apparent relief. Again , they went back to their native village and restarted the treatment from the faith healer.This case study highlights the fact that in spite of the significant development of medical science , many questions pertaining to epilepsy treatment are still unanswered. Such dissatisfaction with the allopathic treatment of epilepsy is very common. Complexity of the disease and high cost of modern medication , side effects of drugs , efficient but heavy treatment protocols and unpredictable outcome are responsible for continued practice of people consulting faith healers for treatment of epilepsy. However , these remain unnoticed and undocumented.
