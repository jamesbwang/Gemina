  To compare functional outcomes of warm ischemia RPN ( wRPN) to cold ischemia RPN ( cRPN) in `` at risk '' patients. Retrospective review of Institutional database queried for all patients who underwent cRPN/wRPN ( January 2007- December 2016). For the study purpose , patients with solitary kidney and/or history of partial nephrectomy and/or multiple tumors and/or preoperative eGFR < 60 ml/min were extracted. To reduce inherent biases , groups were matched on key variables related to renal function via a greedy matching algorithm with no replacement. Renal functional outcomes were evaluated by eGFR drops at 1-3 days , and at 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 months postoperatively. A linear mixed effects ( LME) model was used to assess eGFR at each follow-up who received either cRPN or wRPN. Follow-up was treated as a factor variable to account for non-linear time trends. Contrast analysis was used to compare cRPN vs wRPN groups at each follow-up , using Sidak-Holms p-value adjustments for multiple comparisons. Out of 19 patients cRPN and 279 wRPN patients , 14 cRPN patients were finally matched 1:1 with no replacement to 14 wRPN. There was no significant difference in Pre-operative eGRF for matched patients undergoing cRPN vs wRPN. Since the first postoperative day , cRPN patients had higher eGFR. The difference was statistically significant since the 3rd month postoperatively , ( mean difference = 18.201 , 95 % CI: 1.930-34.472) and remained at both the 6th month ( mean difference = 18.839 , 95 % CI: 2.568-35.109) and the 12th month ( mean difference = 21.277 , 95 % CI: 5.006-37.547) follow-up. Accounting for unmodifiable and modifiable factors , in a cohort of highly selected patients `` at risk '' for postoperative significant decline in renal function after RPN , renal functional outcomes appear to be superior with cold ischemia technique.
