  We assessed the applicability of giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs) for RNA detection using in vesicle reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR). We prepared GUVs that encapsulated one-pot RT-PCR reaction mixture including template RNA , primers , and Taqman probe , using water-in-oil emulsion transfer method. After thermal cycling , we analysed the GUVs that exhibited intense fluorescence signals , which represented the cDNA amplification. The detailed analysis of flow cytometry data demonstrated that rRNA and mRNA in the total RNA can be amplified from 10-100 copies in the GUVs with 5-10 Î¼m diameter , although the fraction of reactable GUV was approximately 60 % at most. Moreover , we report that the target RNA , which was directly transferred into the GUV reactors via membrane fusion , can be amplified and detected using in vesicle RT-PCR. These results suggest that the GUVs can be used as biomimetic reactors capable of performing PCR and RT-PCR , which are important in analytical and diagnostic applications with additional functions.
