  This study presents the elemental concentration obtained in two Algerian spices ( Coriandrum sativum L. and Cuminum cyminum L.) evaluated by instrumental neutron activation analysis ( INAA) , in order to highlight the importance of these spices as a potential source of micronutrients. The daily intake of micronutrients and potentially toxic elements were determined and compared with the recommended values ( RDA) and were found to be well below the tolerance limits. Twenty-two elements were assessed , eight essential chemicals were quantified with tendency K > Ca > Na > Fe > Zn > Cr > Co > Se , and three potential toxic elements were present in the descending content pattern Br > As > Sb.
