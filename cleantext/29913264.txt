  We hypothesized that preferential retropalatal as compared to retroglossal collapse in patients with obstructive sleep apnea was due to a narrower retropalatal area and a higher retropalatal compliance. Patients with a greater retropalatal compliance would exhibit a recognizable increase in negative effort dependence ( NED). Fourteen patients underwent upper airway endoscopy with simultaneous recordings of airflow and pharyngeal<symptom> pressure during natural sleep. Airway areas were obtained by manually outlining the lumen. Compliance was calculated by the change of airway area from end-expiration to a pressure swing of -5 cm H Compared to the retroglossal airway , the retropalatal airway was smaller at end-expiration ( p < 0.001) , and had greater absolute and relative compliances ( p < 0.001). NED was positively associated with retropalatal relative area change ( r = 0.47; p < 0.001). Retropalatal airway is narrower and more collapsible than retroglossal airway. Retropalatal compliance is reflected in the clinically-available NED value.
