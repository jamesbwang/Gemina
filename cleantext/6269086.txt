  The translation of engineering designs to materials sciences by means of synthetic biological tools represents a novel concept for the development of information-processing materials systems. Here , we provide data on the mathematical model-guided implementation of a biomaterials-based positive feedback loop for the detection of proteolytic activities. Furthermore , we present data on an extended system design for the detection of the antibiotic novobiocin. This work is related to the research article `` Synthetic biology-inspired design of signal-amplifying materials systems '' ( Wagner et al. , 2018) ( 1).
