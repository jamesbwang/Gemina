  This study examined the impact of residential instability and family structure transitions on the development of internalizing and externalizing problems from age 2 through 10.5. Child 's race was examined as a moderator. Caregiver reports of internalizing and externalizing behaviors were obtained on 665 children at ages 5 and 10.5. Early-childhood residential and family structure transitions predicted elevated internalizing and externalizing problems at ages 5 and 10.5 , but only for Caucasian children. These findings suggest that residential and family structure instability during early childhood independently contribute to children 's later emotional and behavioral development , but vary as a function of the child 's race. Community organizations ( e.g. , Women , Infant , and Children) can connect turbulent families with resources to attenuate effects of residential and family structure instability.
