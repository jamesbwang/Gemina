  We present a new algorithm for the analysis of whispering gallery modes ( WGMs) found in the cavity enhanced Raman spectra retrieved from optically tweezed droplets. Our algorithm improves the computational scaling when analyzing core-shell droplets ( i.e. phase-separated or biphasic droplets) in the aerosol optical tweezers ( AOT) , making it computationally practical to analyze spectra collected at a few Hz over hours-long experiments. This enables the determination of the size and refractive index of both the core and shell phases with high accuracy , at 0.5 Hz time resolution. Phase-separated core-shell droplets are common morphologies in a wide variety of biophysical , colloidal , and aerosolized chemical systems , and have recently become a major focus in understanding the atmospheric chemistry of particulate matter. Our new approach reduces the number of parameters directly searched for , decreasing computational demands. We assess the accuracy of the diameters and refractive indices retrieved from a homogeneous or core-shell droplet. We demonstrate the performance of the new algorithm using experimental data from a droplet of aqueous glycerol coated by squalane. We demonstrate that a shell formation causes adjacent WGMs to split from each other in their wavenumber position through the addition of a secondary organic aerosol shell around a NaCl ( aq) droplet. Our new algorithm paves the way for more in-depth physiochemical experiments into liquid-liquid phase separation and their consequences for interfacial chemistry-a topic with growing experimental needs for understanding the dynamics and chemistry of atmospheric aerosol particles , and in biochemical systems.
