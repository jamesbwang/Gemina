  To study the characteristics of blindness<symptom> after ocular trauma. In this retrospective descriptive study , we considered the files of patients who had consulted the service for ocular trauma between January 2008 and December 2014. Included were patients of both sexes and all ages whose monocular or binocular vision with best optical correction was strictly below 1/20. Statistical analysis was performed with EPI Info version 3.5.4 software , and the Chi Over the period from 2008 to 2014 , we found 100 cases of blindness<symptom> ( 101 eyes) resulting from 591 cases of ocular trauma , for a frequency of 16.92 %. Among them , 75 men with a median age of 35.5 Â± 19.8 years. Children younger than 15 years accounted for 11 % of the series. The blindness<symptom> was monocular in 99 % and binocular in 1 % , distributed as follows: 55 cases ( 55 %) category V , 27 ( 27 %) category IV and 18 ( 18 %) category III according to the CIM-10. In the anterior segment , cataract was responsible for category III and IV blindness<symptom> , while in the posterior segment , retinal detachment was found in all categories. In all age ranges irrespective of sex , category V blindness<symptom> was most frequent. Blindness<symptom> following ocular trauma is frequent in our context. It can be avoided. Consequently , it is essential to put in place strategies for prevention of ocular trauma via education of the population through public awareness campaigns.
