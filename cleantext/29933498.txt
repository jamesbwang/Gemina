  Due in part to the needs of the biopharmaceutical industry , there has been an increased drive to generate high quality recombinant proteins in large amounts. However , achieving high yields can be a challenge as the novelty and increased complexity of new targets often makes them ` difficult-to-express '. This study aimed to define the molecular features that restrict the production of a model ` difficult-to-express ' recombinant protein , Tissue Inhibitor Metalloproteinase-3 ( TIMP-3). Building from experimental data , computational approaches were used to rationalize the redesign of this recombinant target to generate a chimera with enhanced secretion. The results highlight the importance of early identification of unfavourable sequence attributes , enabling the generation of engineered protein forms that bypass ` secretory ' bottlenecks and result in efficient recombinant protein production.
