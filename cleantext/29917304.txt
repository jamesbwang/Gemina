  To determine whether penile blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( PBP) can be used to identify patients who can benefit from tadalafil treatment , the correlation between PBP at baseline and changes in lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS) induced by tadalafil treatment was studied prospectively. Patients with BPH who were poor responders to Î± In all , 51 patients were investigated. The IPSS in the low-PBP group decreased immediately after the start of treatment , and there was significant improvement in the IPSS from baseline at 4 and 12 weeks after the start of treatment , whilst the IPSS in the high-PBP group did not show significant changes. On multivariate analysis , PBP at baseline , anticholinergic drug use , and IPSS at baseline were significant predictors of a good IPSS response to tadalafil treatment. This study demonstrated that PBP could reliably identify patients with BPH who could benefit from tadalafil treatment. Patients with low PBP could be better responders to tadalafil.
