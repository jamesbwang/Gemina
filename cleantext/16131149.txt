  Fruits and vegetables are considered a beneficial contribution to the human diet. Especially , berries contain a great deal of bioactive compounds , such as anthocyanins , organic acids , tannins , phenols , and antioxidants. Apart from organic substances , inorganic nutrients are also present in fruits. Some metals and metalloids are essential for humans , whilst others may exhibit harmful effects. Wild grown berries , collected in so-called unpolluted areas , are considered to be free of any potentially toxic ingredients. However , due to transmission processes pollutants can also reach remote areas and , furthermore , metal uptake from the soil via roots has to be taken into account. Thus , the presented study focused on the determination of Al , Cd , Cr , Ni , and Pb in lingonberries , blueberries , and rose hips collected in a non-polluted area in Croatia. Neither Cd nor Cr could be found in any sample. Ni levels were mainly up to 25 mg/kg , in a comparable range to the literature data. No health threat is to be expected by eating these fruits and berries regarding Cd , Cr , and Ni. Rose hips , however , contain Pb beyond the stipulated limit in fruits , and also Al is present at a high level ( 8 mg/g).
