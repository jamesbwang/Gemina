  Clinical application of stem cell derivatives requires clinical-grade cells and sufficient preclinical proof of safety and efficacy , preferably in primates. We previously successfully established a clinical-grade human parthenogenetic embryonic stem cell ( hPESC) line , but the suitability of its subtype-specific progenies for therapy is not clear. Here , we compared the function of clinical-grade hPESC-derived midbrain dopaminergic ( DA) neurons in two canonical protocols in a primate Parkinson 's disease ( PD) model. We found that the grafts did not form tumors and produced variable but apparent behavioral improvement for at least 24 months in most monkeys in both groups. In addition , a slight DA increase in the striatum<pathogen> correlates with significant functional improvement. These results demonstrated that clinical-grade hPESCs can serve as a reliable source of cells for PD treatment. Our proof-of-concept findings provide preclinical data for China 's first ESC-based phase I/IIa clinical study of PD ( ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT03119636).
