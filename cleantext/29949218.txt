  Due to the spatial heterogeneity of stable isotope ratios of single elements measured in attempts to georeference bioarchaeological finds , multi-isotope fingerprints are frequently employed under the assumption that similar isotopic signatures are indicative of similar shared environments by the individuals studied. The extraction of the spatial information from multi-isotope datasets , however , is challenging. Gaussian mixture clustering of six- to seven-dimensional isotopic fingerprints measured in archaeological animal and human bones was performed. Uncremated animal bones served for an isotopic mapping of a specific reference area of eminent archaeological importance , namely the Inn-Eisack-Adige passage across the European Alps. The fingerprints consist of The bone finds were successfully decontaminated. Animal and human isotope clusters not only reflect individual similarities in the multi-isotopic fingerprints but also permit a spatial allocation of the finds. This holds also for cremated finds where the Î´ Gaussian mixture clustering is a promising method for the interpretation of multi-isotopic fingerprints aiming at detecting and quantifying migration and trade.
