  The fruit epidermal features such as the size of tubercules are important fruit quality traits for cucumber production. But the mechanisms underlying tubercule formation remain elusive. Here , tubercule size locus CsTS1 was identified by map-based cloning and was found to encode an oleosin protein. Allelic variation was identified in the promoter region of CsTS1 , resulting in low expression of CsTS1 in all 22 different small-warty or nonwarty cucumber lines. High CsTS1 expression levels were closely correlated with increased fruit tubercule size among 44 different cucumber lines. Transgenic complementation and RNAi-mediated gene silencing of CsTS1 in transgenic cucumber plants demonstrated that CsTS1 positively regulates the development of tubercules. CsTS1 is highly expressed in the peel at fruit tubercule forming and enlargement stage. Auxin content and expression of three auxin signalling pathway genes were altered in the 35S: CsTS1 and CsTS1-RNAi fruit tubercules , a result that was supported by comparing the cell size of the control and transgenic fruit tubercules.
