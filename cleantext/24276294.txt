  High-Intensity Functional Training ( HIFT) is a novel exercise intervention that may test body systems in a balanced and integrated fashion by challenging individuals ' abilities to complete mechanical work. However , research has not previously determined if physical work capacity is unique to traditional physiologic measures of fitness. Twenty-five healthy men and women completed a six-week HIFT intervention with physical work capacity and various physiologic measures of fitness assessed pre- and post-intervention. At baseline , these physiologic measures of fitness ( e.g. , aerobic capacity) were significantly associated with physical work capacity and this relationship was even stronger at post-intervention assessment. Further , there were significant improvements across these physiologic measures in response to the delivered intervention. However , the change in these physiologic measures failed to predict the change in physical work capacity induced via HIFT. These findings point to the potential utility of HIFT as a unique challenge to individuals ' physiology beyond traditional resistance or aerobic training. Elucidating the translational impact of increasing work capacity via HIFT may be of great interest to health and fitness practitioners ranging from strength/conditioning coaches to physical therapists.
