  Two strains , which formed pink colonies and produced ballistoconidia and represented a novel anamorphic yeast species , were isolated from peat ( DMKU-SPS1-2) and fern leaf ( ST-145) collected in Thailand. Analysis of the sequences of the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit ( LSU) rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer ( ITS) regions showed that the two strains were identical to the sequences of the D1/D2 domains of the LSU rRNA gene and differed by two nucleotide substitutions in the ITS regions. Phylogenetic analysis based on the combined sequences of the ITS and the D1/D2 regions confirmed that the two strains represented a single species in the genus Cryptotrichosporon that was distinct from the other known species of the genus.
