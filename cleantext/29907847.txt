  The frequency of metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) is significantly higher in schizophrenia ( SCH) patients , when compared to the general populatiotin. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether genetic variants T-786C ( rs2070744) , G894T ( rs1799983) and C774T ( rs1549758) in the endothelial nitric oxide ( NOS3) gene and/or their haplotypes could be associated with the risk of MetS in SCH patients or healthy subjects from Russian population. We performed two case-control comparisons. NOS3 polymorphisms were genotyped in 70 SCH patients with MetS , 190 normal weight SCH patients , 155 MetS patients , and 100 healthy controls. MetS was defined as per the criteria proposed by the International Diabetes Federation ( IDF). Anthropometric , clinical , biochemical parameters , and serum nitrite concentrations were measured in all samples. Haplotype frequency estimations and linkage disequilibrium measures were made using Haploview 4.2. The higher C allele ( P = 0.009) and lower TT genotype ( P = 0.008) frequencies of T-786C polymorphism were found in SCH patients with MetS compared to those in normal weight SCH patients. SCH patients with MetS who were carriers of the T-786C TT genotype had lower serum total cholesterol levels in comparison to the CC genotype ( P = 0.016). Furthermore , the 774T/894T haplotype was more frequent in non-SCH individuals with MetS compared to healthy controls ( P = 0.0004 , odds ratio = 2.18 , 95 % confidence interval 1.4-3.37). Conversely , the most common haplotype 774C/894G was less frequent in MetS patients than in healthy controls ( P = 0.013 , odds ratio = 0.61 , 95 % confidence interval 0.41-0.9). These results indicate that the NOS3 T-786C promoter polymorphism was closely associated with MetS risk in SCH patients. In addition , the haplotypes composed of G894T and C774T polymorphisms are associated with the MetS susceptibility in Russian population.
