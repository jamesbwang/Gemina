  c-Jun is a member of the early mammalian transcriptional regulators belonging to the AP-1 family , which participates in a wide range of cellular processes such as proliferation , apoptosis , tumorigenesis , and differentiation. Despite its established role in cell survival upon stress , its participation in the stress response induced by bacterial infections has been poorly investigated. To study the potential role of c-Jun in this context we choose the widely studied Î±-toxin produced by
