  Medical nutrition therapy is a mainstay of gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM) treatment. However , data are limited regarding the optimal diet for achieving euglycemia and improved perinatal outcomes. This study aims to investigate whether modified dietary interventions are associated with improved glycemia and/or improved birth weight outcomes in women with GDM when compared with control dietary interventions. Data from published randomized controlled trials that reported on dietary components , maternal glycemia , and birth weight were gathered from 12 databases. Data were extracted in duplicate using prespecified forms. From 2,269 records screened , 18 randomized controlled trials involving 1,151 women were included. Pooled analysis demonstrated that for modified dietary interventions when compared with control subjects , there was a larger decrease in fasting and postprandial glucose ( -4.07 mg/dL ( 95 % CI -7.58 , -0.57); Modified dietary interventions favorably influenced outcomes related to maternal glycemia and birth weight. This indicates that there is room for improvement in usual dietary advice for women with GDM.
