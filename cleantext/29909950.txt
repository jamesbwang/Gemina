  The management of pregnancy in patients with mitral valve stenosis disease continues to pose a challenge to the clinician. The aim of study was to evaluate the association between mitral valve stenosis and maternal and fetal out come. Eighty-three pregnant women with mitral valve disease , followed-up from 2009 to 2012 , were prospectively evaluated medical history , NYHA class assessment , ECG and echocardiography were performed during pregnancy and after delivery. Women with mitral stenosis had significantly clinical higher incidence of complications deterioration of clinical status was observed ( 44.57 % , P = 0.0001) congestive heart<symptom> failure<symptom> had observed ( 27.71 % , P = 0.0001) , hospitalization ( 33.73 % , P = 0.0001) , need of cardiac medications ( 53.75 % , P = 0.009) , arrhythmias ( 16 % , P < 0.05) , New born outcome , mitral stenosis had an effect on fetal outcome. We had increasing preterm , delivery ( 17.50 % , P = 0.018) , hypotrophy ( 20.48 % , P = 0.001) , intra-uterine growth retardation ( 12.04 % , P = 0.011) new born hospitalizations ( 13.25 % , P = 0.03) Increased maternal morbidity and unfavorable fetal outcome was seen mostly in patients with moderate and severe mitral stenosis. Pregnant with critical mitral stenosis form a high-risk groups of life-threatening complications. There is need for close maternal follow-up and fetal surveillance and repair of mitral stenosis should be performed before pregnancy.
