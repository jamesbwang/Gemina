  A trifunctional , partially fluorinated anthracene-substituted triptycene monomer was spread at an air/water interface into a monolayer , which was transformed into a long-range-ordered 2D polymer by irradiation with a standard UV lamp. The polymer was analyzed by Brewster angle microscopy , scanning tunneling microscopy measurements , and non-contact atomic force microscopy , which confirmed the generation of a network structure with lattice parameters that are virtually identical to a structural model network based on X-ray diffractometry of a closely related 2D polymer. The nc-AFM images highlight the long-range order over areas of at least 300 Ã— 300 nm
