  The amyloid precursor protein ( APP) is a key molecule in Alzheimer 's disease. The prevailing view is that APP is initially transported to the plasma membrane as a full-length protein. Its localization at the cell surface can trigger downstream signaling and APP cleavage. Our previous work has shown that Neuregulin 1 ( NRG1) has neuroprotective effects in an Alzheimer 's disease model. In the present study , we examine whether NRG1 signaling is involved in APP expression and non-amyloidogenic processing in neuronal cells. Here we show that NRG1 increased the cell surface expression of APP without changing the total amount of APP mRNA or protein expression in SH-SY5Y cells and in rat primary cortical neurons. In addition , NRG1 significantly increased the levels of the secreted form of APP , sAPPα , in the conditioned media but did not change the expression of ADAM10 on the cell surface or in the cell lysates. Furthermore , we found that the protein level of NRG1 was reduced in the hippocampus of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) patients. Our results demonstrate that NRG1 increased APP expression on the cell surface and sAPPα secretion into the media of neuronal cell cultures. Taken together , these results suggest a role for NRG1 in non-amyloidogenic processing.
