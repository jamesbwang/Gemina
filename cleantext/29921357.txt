  This study aims to examine which marker or testing protocols have been suggested for cardiovascular disease ( CVD) risk assessment in asymptomatic populations , at which CVD risk level , and how this can be implemented for CVD risk assessment in pilot populations. A systematic search was performed using Systematic Reviews Subset on PubMed; the OvidSP interface , including all EBM reviews and EMBASE databases; and the G-I-N International Guideline Library. From each recommendation , we extracted data on consideration of the use of a marker or test for cardiovascular risk assessment in asymptomatic populations. Included were 45 guidelines , systematic reviews , or meta-analyses relevant to cardiovascular risk assessment in asymptomatic populations. The majority ( 9/12) of the citations recommend coronary artery calcium score ( CACS) for CVD risk assessment in intermediate-risk ( 10-yr CVD risk score of 10-20 %) asymptomatic adults. Other cardiac and vascular tests that may also be considered include the measurements of carotid-intima media thickness , supplemented by carotid plaque , and the ankle brachial index for prevention of peripheral artery disease and stroke. Stress myocardial perfusion scan is the potential cardiac functional test to be used with pilots with 5-yr risk of â‰¥ 15 %. Among laboratory markers , only hs-CRP has a potency to be used in CVD risk assessment in intermediate-risk asymptomatic adults; however , the strength of the recommendation is not adequate. Among the cardiac and vascular testing available , CACS is the most frequently suggested test. The implications of findings for CVD risk assessment in airline pilots are highlighted in this paper.Wirawan IMA , Griffiths RF , Larsen PD.
