  A Ni-based catalyst ( Ni-PVP/PFC3R) with polyvinyl pyrrolidone ( PVP) as a dispersant supported in a pretreated fluid catalytic cracking catalyst residue ( PFC3R) was synthesized and applied to C9 petroleum resin ( C9 PR) hydrogenation. For comparison , a Ni catalyst without PVP ( Ni/PFC3R) was prepared in the same way. Ni-PVP/PFC3R exhibited higher activity and better stability. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction , scanning electron microscope , H
