  This paper reports the synthesis and structural characterisation of a series of cyclooctatetraenyl ( C8H8) complexes of calcium and strontium , most of them containing the bis ( trimethylsilyl) amido ligand. Mixing MI2 ( M = Ca , Sr) , KN ( SiMe3) 2 and K2 ( C8H8) in thf in a 2: 2: 1 ratio gave the inverse sandwich amido complexes ( ( ( ( Me3Si) 2N) M ( thf) x) 2 ( μ-C8H8)) ( M = Ca , x = 1; M = Sr , x = 2) ( 1-Ca , 1-Sr) in fair to good yields. From a 1: 1: 1 ratio , the mixed potassium calcium complex ( ( ( ( Me3Si) 2N) Ca ( thf)) ( μ-C8H8) K) ( 2) was obtained in good yield. The reaction of 2 with a 1: 1 mixture of CaI2 and KN ( SiMe3) 2 yielded 1-Ca confirming that the reaction could be carried out stepwise. Attempts at making heterobimetallic calcium strontium amido complexes from the reaction of 2 with Sr ( N ( SiMe3) 2) 2 led to redistribution reactions which afforded the potassium strontium complex ( ( K ( ( Me3Si) 2N) 2Sr) 2 ( μ-C8H8)) ( 3) among other species. Complex 3 was more conveniently synthesised in fair yield starting from a 2: 4: 1 molar mixture of SrI2 , KN ( SiMe3) 2 and K2 ( C8H8) , respectively. Treatment of 2 with PhC ( triple bond , length as m-dash) CH in benzene yielded an insoluble complex tentatively formulated as the polymeric complex ( CaK ( CCPh) ( C8H8) ( thf) x) n ( 4). Upon dissolution in thf , 4 underwent a redistribution reaction yielding the X-ray characterised ( ( Ca ( μ-C8H8) 2) K2 ( thf) 2) ( 5) and a homoleptic calcium alkynyl complex ( Ca ( CCPh) 2 ( thf) x). Several compounds were characterised by X-ray diffraction as discrete or polymeric structures where CaCπ interactions were identified in some cases. Despite identified drawbacks , such as the lability of the coordinated thf ligands and facile redistribution reactions , this study represents the first synthetic approach to cyclooctatetraenyl heavy alkaline-earth metal amido complexes.
