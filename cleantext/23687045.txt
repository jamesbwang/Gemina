  This study analyses spatially resolved estimates of mass budget and surface velocity of glaciers in the Zanskar Basin of Western Himalaya in the context of varying debris cover , glacier hypsometry and orientation. The regional glacier mass budget for the period of 1999-2014 is -0.38 ± 0.09 m w.e./ a. Individual mass budgets of 10 major glaciers in the study area varied between -0.13 ± 0.07 and -0.66 ± 0.09 m w.e./ a. Elevation changes on debris-covered ice are considerably less negative than over clean ice. At the same time , glaciers having > 20 % of their area covered by debris have more negative glacier-wide mass budgets than those with < 20 % debris cover. This paradox is likely explained by the comparatively larger ablation area of extensively debris-covered glaciers compared to clean-ice glaciers , as indicated by hypsometric analysis. Additionally , surface velocities computed for the 2013-14 period reveal near stagnant debris-covered snouts but dynamically active main trunks , with maximum recorded velocity of individual glaciers ranging between ~ 50 ± 5.58 and ~ 90 ± 5.58 m/a. The stagnant debris-covered extent , which varies from glacier-to-glacier , are also characterized by ice cliffs and melt ponds that appreciably increase the overall surface melting of debris-covered areas.
