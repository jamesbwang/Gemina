  Sleep and substance use disorders commonly co-occur. Insomnia is commonly associated with use and withdrawal from substances. Circadian rhythm abnormalities are being increasingly linked with psychoactive substance use. Other sleep disorders , such as sleep-related breathing disorder , should be considered in the differential diagnosis of insomnia , especially in those with opioid use or alcohol use disorder. Insomnia that is brief or occurs in the context of active substance use is best treated by promoting abstinence. A referral to a sleep medicine clinic should be considered for those with chronic insomnia or when another intrinsic sleep disorder is suspected.
