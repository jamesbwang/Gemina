  The reported data regarding the effects of hypomethylating agents ( HMAs) on the risk of infections seem to be poorly documented and heterogeneous. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials comparing HMA-containing regimens with any other regimen administered to patients with myeloid neoplasms. A comprehensive search was conducted until February 2018. Two reviewers appraised the quality of the trials and the extracted data. The primary outcome was grade 3/4 infections. The secondary outcomes included febrile neutropenia , fever<disease> of unknown origin , grade 3/4 neutropenia , infection-related mortality , and all-cause mortality. The relative risks ( RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were estimated and pooled. A fixed-effect model was used to pool the data unless significant heterogeneity was present , in which case a random-effects model was used. We identified 9 trials reported from 2002 to 2016 and randomizing 2184 patients. HMAs were associated with an increase in grade 3/4 infections compared with the comparator ( RR , 1.30; 95 % CI , 1.02-1.66). This was true for the subgroup of patients aged > 60 years ( RR , 1.19; 95 % CI , 1.01-1.39). In addition , HMAs resulted in an increase in the rate of fever<disease> of unknown origin and neutropenia ( RR , 1.48; 95 % CI , 1.15-1.92; RR , 1.48; 95 % CI , 1.22-1.78 , respectively). Although no difference was found in the incidence of fatal infections ( RR , 1.44; 95 % CI , 0.72 to 2.89) , treatment with HMA reduced the incidence of all-cause mortality ( RR , 0.74; 95 % CI , 0.66-0.88). Treatment with HMAs was associated with an increase in the grade 3/4 infection rate.
