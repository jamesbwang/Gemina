  The issue of overprescribing laboratory investigations is an old one in the world of medical practice and it has unfortunately seen a tremendous increase with the digitalisation of medicine , in more recent times. Phrased usually as ` defensive medicine , ' this kind of overmedicalisation steers medical practice away from the ethical , skill-refining fronts on the part of doctors and imposes an unnecessary financial burden on the patients ' pockets , adding to their suffering. Pakistan has not been able to save itself either , from the impropriety that roots out of what is now almost a norm in medical practice. The existent low literacy and awareness rates in the masses of the country , coupled with the cultural respect for doctors and lack of financial resources amongst the poor patients to stand up to doctors or the hospitals , have all made it even easier for physicians to get away with ordering whatever investigations they choose. The issue is a grave one and its rampancy demands that attention is drawn to it and efforts are made to transition into the practice of evidence-based medicine and quaternary prevention.
