  Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( AECOPD) is closely associated with airway inflammation<symptom> including monocytes , lymphocytes , and neutrophils. Monocytes play an essential role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). To elucidate the association of circulating monocyte alteration with AECOPD , we analyzed monocyte subpopulation in the peripheral blood of 16 healthy volunteers and 22 AECOPD patients at the stages of admission and remission after clinical therapy. We found a dramatic increase of a previously unreported population of large size circulating atypical monocytes ( A Mo) in AECOPD patients , characterized by higher forward scatter and lower side scatter values than the typical monocytes ( T Mo) which were observed predominantly in healthy individuals. Further analysis showed that A Mo expressed higher levels of CD16 , intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1) , and chemotactic protein-1 receptor-2 ( CCR2) than T Mo.. In contrast , the expression of class II antigen ( HLA-DR) by A Mo was lower than T Mo.. More importantly , we observed that the percentage of circulating A Mo among total monocytes correlated with the length of hospital stay ( time to remission) and disease duration. The data suggest that circulating A Mo might have the potential to serve as a biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of AECOPD.
