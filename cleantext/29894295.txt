  Protein crystallization in living cells has been observed surprisingly often as a native assembly process during the past decades , and emerging evidence indicates that this phenomenon is also accessible for recombinant proteins. But only recently the advent of high-brilliance synchrotron sources , X-ray free-electron lasers , and improved serial data collection strategies has allowed the use of these micrometer-sized crystals for structural biology. Thus , in cellulo crystallization could offer exciting new possibilities for proteins that do not crystallize applying conventional approaches. In this review , we comprehensively summarize the current knowledge of intracellular protein crystallization. This includes an overview of the cellular functions , the physical properties , and , if known , the mode of regulation of native in cellulo crystal formation , complemented with a discussion of the reported crystallization events of recombinant proteins and the current method developments to successfully collect X-ray diffraction data from in cellulo crystals. Although the intracellular protein self-assembly mechanisms are still poorly understood , regulatory differences between native in cellulo crystallization linked to a specific function and accidently crystallizing proteins , either disease associated or recombinantly introduced , become evident. These insights are important to systematically exploit living cells as protein crystallization chambers in the future.
