  Plants face numerous challenges from both aboveground and belowground stressors , and defend themselves against harmful insects and microorganisms in many ways. Because plant responses to biotic stresses are not only local but also systemic , belowground interactions can influence aboveground interactions in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> ( AMF) are soilborne organisms that form symbiotic associations with many plant roots and are thought to play a central role in plant nutrition , growth , and fitness. In the present study , we focused on the influence of AMF on rice defense against pests. We inoculated rice plants with AMF in several field and greenhouse experiments to test whether the interaction of AMF with rice roots changes the resistance of rice against two chewing insects , the rice water weevil (
