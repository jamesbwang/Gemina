  With the aim to explore the effect of luminol as a multifunctional dopant for conjugated polymers , the present study reports the ultrasound-assisted doping of polycarbazole ( PCz) and poly ( o-anisidine) ( PAnis) with luminol in basic , acidic and neutral media. The synthesized homopolymers and luminol doped polymers were characterized using FT-IR , UV-visible and XRD studies while the photo-physical properties were investigated via fluorescence spectroscopy. Density functional theory ( DFT) calculations were performed to get insights into the structural , optical , and electronic properties of homopolymers of polycarbazole ( PCz) and poly ( o-anisidine) ( PAnis). Vibrational bands B3LYP/6 -311 G ( d , p) level , UV-vis spectral bands and electronic properties such as ionization potentials ( IP) , electron affinities ( EA) and HOMO-LUMO band gap energies of the homopolymers and doped polymers were calculated and compared. Results revealed that luminol doped polymers showed different photo-physical characteristics in acidic , basic and neutral media which could be tuned to obtain near infrared ( NIR) emitting polymers.
