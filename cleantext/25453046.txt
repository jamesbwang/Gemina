  Infective endocarditis<disease> is a heterogeneous condition whose incidence is rising. Despite advances in surgery and diagnostic methods , one-year mortality has not changed and it remains at 30 %. Patients with prosthetic valve and intra-cardiac device-related endocarditis<disease> are being seen more frequently and this condition is difficult to diagnose with conventional microbiological and imaging techniques. The modified Duke criteria lack sensitivity in this group and should be supplemented with newer imaging techniques , including 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( 18F-FDG-PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT). In this article , we discuss these techniques and their role in the diagnosis of infective
