  Recent work suggests that thermally stable nanocrystallinity in metals is achievable in several binary alloys by modifying grain boundary energies via solute segregation. The remarkable thermal stability of these alloys has been demonstrated in recent reports , with many alloys exhibiting negligible grain growth during prolonged exposure to near-melting temperatures. Pt-Au , a proposed stable alloy consisting of two noble metals , is shown to exhibit extraordinary resistance to wear. Ultralow wear rates , less than a monolayer of material removed per sliding pass , are measured for Pt-Au thin films at a maximum Hertz contact stress of up to 1.1 GPa. This is the first instance of an all-metallic material exhibiting a specific wear rate on the order of 10
