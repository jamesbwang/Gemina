  Expression of microRNAs ( miRNAs) in the human placenta is dynamic across gestation , with expression of miRNAs belonging to the C14MC , C19MC and miR-371-3 clusters. Specifically , miRNAs within the C19MC cluster are exclusively expressed in primates with predominant expression in the placenta. Non-human primates can be utilized to study developmental processes of placentation in vivo that can not be assessed in the human placenta , however , miRNA expression has not been defined in the macaque placenta. Our objective was to profile miRNAs in the macaque placenta , hypothesizing that expression is conserved between the macaque and human placenta. Total RNA from first trimester and term macaque placentas ( n = 4 per group) was analyzed through RNA-sequencing and validated by quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR). A total of 607 pre-miRNAs previously annotated in the macaque reference database ( miRBase21) were detected , and 166 miRNAs were differentially expressed between first trimester and term placentas. A total of 457 unannotated sequences were detected and deemed candidate novel miRNAs by miRDeep2 software. Differential expression was confirmed for six of nine miRNAs evaluated by qRT-PCR. Comparative analysis demonstrated expression of several miRNA orthologs of human pregnancy-associated miRNA clusters in the macaque placenta. Profiling placental miRNAs of the macaque revealed conserved expression of a number of miRNAs within the C14MC , C19MC and miR-371-3 clusters between the human and macaque. These results establish non-human primates as a model for human placentation and miRNA biology , with the prediction of their functional significance in placental development and function.
