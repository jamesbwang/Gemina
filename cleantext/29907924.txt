  This work investigated the ability of a 6-day heat acclimation protocol to impart heat acclimation-mediated cross-tolerance ( HACT) in C2C12 myotubes , as indicated by changes in inflammatory and apoptotic responses to subsequent lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) challenge. Myotubes were incubated at 40 °C for 2 h/day over 6 days ( HA) or maintained for 6 days at 37 °C ( C). Following 24 h recovery , myotubes from each group received either no stimulation or 500 ng/ml LPS for 2 h ( HA + LPS and C + LPS , respectively). Cell lysates were collected and analyzed for protein markers of the heat shock<symptom> response , inflammation<symptom> , and apoptosis. As compared to C , HA exhibited an elevated heat shock<symptom> response ( HSP70 ( + 99 %); HSP60 ( + 216 %); HSP32 ( + 40 %); all p < 0.01) and reduced inflammatory and apoptotic signaling ( p-NF-ĸB: NF-ĸB (- 99 % %); p-JNK (- 49 %); all p < 0.01). When compared to C + LPS , HA + LPS also exhibited an elevated heat shock<symptom> response ( HSP70 ( + 68 %); HSP60 ( + 32 %); HSP32 ( + 38 %); all p < 0.01). However , inflammatory and apoptotic responses in HA + LPS were increased ( p-IKBa: IKBa ( + 432 %); p-NF-ĸB: NF-ĸB ( + 283 %); caspase-8p18 ( + 53 %); p-JNK ( + 41 %); all p < 0.05). This unanticipated finding may be due to increased TLR4-mediated signaling capacity in HA + LPS , as indicated by upregulation of TLR4 ( ( + 24 %); MyD88 ( + 308 %); p-NIK ( + 199 %); and p-IKKα/b ( + 81 %); all p < 0.05). Data suggest HA reduces inflammatory and apoptotic signaling in skeletal muscle cells that are maintained under basal conditions. However , HACT is selective and does not apply to TLR4 signaling in the present model.
