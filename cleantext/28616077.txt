  The economic viability of hydrodeoxygenation process using Camelina , Carinata and Jatropha feedstocks for aviation biofuel production was evaluated for two product profiles: ( i) maximum diesel production and ( ii) maximum jet fuel production ( HRJ). Deterministic analysis of Camelina and Carinata diesel facilities returned positive NPVs and IRRs of 25 and 18 % , respectively. Stochastic analysis suggested that the probabilities of positive NPVs were 75 , 59 and 15 % , respectively , for Camelina , Carinata and Jatropha diesel plants. Jet fuel facilities presented probabilities of loss of 98 , 99 and 100 % for Camelina , Carinata and Jatropha scenarios , respectively. Sensitivity analysis determined that financial performance was majorly influenced by feedstock and fuel prices. Categories of subsidies to enhance the attractiveness of the projects were studied. Camelina , Carinata and Jatropha plants targeting HRJ required incentives of 0.31 , 0.39 and 0.61 US$/ L of biofuel produced , respectively , to reduce the probabilities of loss to approximately 30 %.
