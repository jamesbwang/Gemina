  Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) is an important gene in the development of lung adenocarcinoma. However , there is controversy regarding the association between EGFR mutations and survival time of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. In the present study , tissue specimens and clinical data were collected from 219 patients with lung adenocarcinoma who had not undergone prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy. EGFR mutations were detected using a fluorescence polymerase chain reaction method , and the association between EGFR mutations and clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. Overall survival ( OS) curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the influence of clinicopathological characteristics on OS was analyzed using the Cox regression model. The EGFR mutation rate was 50.7 % , and the most common mutations were the L858R substitution mutation in exon 21 ( L858R; 54.9 %) and the deletion mutation in exon 19 ( 19-Del; 36 %). The presence of EGFR mutations varied significantly with sex , smoking history , T stage , vascular invasion and adenocarcinoma subtypes ( P < 0.05). The survival time was significantly longer for female , young ( < 60 years-old) , non-smokers or patients exhibiting EGFR mutations ( G719X , 19-Del , L858R and L861Q). The survival time was also significantly longer for patients with a 19-Del mutation , early stage tumors , tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeted therapy-treated patients , for those not exhibiting nerve or vascular invasion , and for those without disease recurrence ( P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that tumor pathological Tumor-Node-Metastasis ( pTNM) stage , nerve invasion , vascular invasion , EGFR mutation and the 19-Del mutation were independent predictors ( P < 0.05). Therefore , tumor pTNM stage , nerve invasion , vascular invasion and EGFR mutation status , particularly that of 19-Del , were independent prognostic factors for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
