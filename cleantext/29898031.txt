  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different surface treatments and polymerization protocols on the bond strength of brackets to enamel , and the degree of conversion of the bonding agents. 120 bovine crowns were embedded in acrylic resin blocks and sanded. Next , the blocks were randomly assigned into 12 groups. Metal brackets were bonded to enamel according to the `` surface treatment '' factor ( A: Phosphoric Acid; ATxt: Phosphoric Acid + Transbond XT Primer ®; Tse: Transbond Plus Self Etching Primer ®; and SBU: Scotchbond Universal ®) and `` polymerization '' factor ( R20: Radii-Cal ®/ 20 seconds; V20: Valo Cordless ®/ 20 seconds; and V3: Valo Cordless ®/ 3 seconds). All samples were stored for 6 months ( water , 37ºC) and then subjected to a shear bond strength test ( SBS). Bond failures were classified according to the Adhesive Remnant Index ( ARI) and analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests ( 5 %). Using the same factors , 120 resin discs were made to assess the degree of conversion ( DC) of the monomer. Data from the SBS ( MPa) and DC ( %) were analyzed by analysis of variance ( 2 factors) and Tukey 's test ( 5 %). For the SBS , the factors `` polymerization '' ( R20 = 8.1 B; V20 = 13.2 A; V3 = 5.2 C , p = 0.0001) and `` surface treatment '' ( A = 3.1 C; ATxt = 13.6 A; Tse = 12.3 A; SBU = 6.3 B , p = 0.0001) were statistically significant among groups. The highest adhesion value were found for the ATxt/V20 group ( 22.2 A) and the lowest value for the A/R20 group ( 1.2 E). Regarding ARI , score 2 was the most prevalent in groups A , ATxt , V20 and V3 , while score 4 was the most prevalent in the Tse , SBU and R20 groups , with no significant difference between them ( p = 1.0). Regarding DC , the factors `` polymerization '' ( R20 = 66.6 A; V20 = 58.4 B; V3 = 45.1 C , p = 0.0001) and `` surface treatment '' ( A = 52B , ATxt = 59.7 A , Tse = 51.4 B , SBU = 63.8 A , p = 0.0001) were statistically significant. Tse was more sensitive to the variations in polymerization protocols than the other surface treatments. Treatment A did not present suitable bond strength or degree of conversion.
