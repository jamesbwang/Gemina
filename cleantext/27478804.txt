  5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU)- based chemotherapy improves the overall survival rates of patients with colorectal cancer ( CRC). However , only a small proportion of patients respond to 5-FU when used as a single agent. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the anticancer property of 5-FU is potentiated by combination treatment with acriflavine ( ACF) in CRC cells. Additionally , the potential underlying molecular mechanisms of the cytotoxic effect of ACF were determined. The cytotoxic effects of ACF , 5-FU and irinotecan on different CRC cell lines with different p53 status were investigated using an MTT assay. SW480 cells that express a mutated form of p53 and two other CRC cell lines were used , HCT116 and LS174T , with wild-type p53. To determine the effect of ACF on the sensitivity of cells to 5-FU , cells were co-treated with the 30 % maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC
