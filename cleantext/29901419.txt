  Incubation of B10.MLM cells , a cell line of alveolar macrophages , with lycopene , a carotenoid , leads to an increase of lycopene content in their microsomal fraction. That increase was higher and developed faster when the cells were incubated with immune complexes formed by lycopene and mAb 6B9 ( L-6B9 mAb) , a monoclonal hapten-specific antibody raised against lycopene , as compared with dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO)- dissolved lycopene ( DMSO-L). Moreover , incubation of B10.MLM cells with L-6B9 mAb complexes was accompanied by more efficient accumulation of lipid droplets in the cultured cells and more significant inhibition of mRNA for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme ( HMG-CoA) reductase , a rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis known to be targeted by lycopene. Additionally , there was a better inhibition of Chlamydia<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> infection in B10.MLM cells infected with the pathogen and incubated thereafter with L-6B9 mAb complexes as compared with DMSO-L. Altogether , the results suggest that association with monoclonal antibody promotes intracellular delivery of lycopene in cultured cells possibly through Fc-receptor mediated uptake.
