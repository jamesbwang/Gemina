  Previous studies have demonstrated that the recombinant Schistosoma japonicum protein P40 ( rSjP40) could inhibit activation of hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs) through the TGF-β1/ Smads signaling pathway. Since multiple microRNAs could play essential roles in HSC activation and in the process of hepatic fibrosis<disease> through targeting Smads , we attempted to seek the potential microRNAs that could be involved in rSjP40-induced inhibition of HSC activation. Using the method of quantitative real-time PCR , we found that rSjP40 could induce miR-146a expression in LX-2 cells. The down-regulated expression levels of Smad4 and α-SMA in LX-2 cells induced by rSjP40 were partially restored by an miR-146a inhibitor. miR-146a can be involved in rSjP40-induced inhibition of HSC activation through targeting Smad4. These findings provide us a new idea to explore the potential mechanisms by which rSjP40 could regulate the process of hepatic
