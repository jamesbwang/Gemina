  Ionic liquids ( ILs) have been extensively studied and are considered green solvents capable of replacing traditional organic solvents. In this study , seven 1,2,3-triazolium derivative ILs have been synthesized. In order to study the effect of the cation nature on the ILs cytotoxicity , their structures were first identified by
