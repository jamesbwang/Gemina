  The major metabolic feature of diabetes is hyperglycemia which has been linked to the diabetes inflammatory processes , and diabetes-related vulnerability to infection. In the present study , we assessed how glucose affected PBMCs in type I interferon ( IFN) production and subsequent signaling. We found that the moderately elevated glucose promoted , and high glucose suppressed type I IFN production , respectively. Pre-exposure to high glucose rendered monocytes more sensitive to IFN-α stimulation with heightened signaling , whereas , instantaneous addition of high glucose did not exhibit such effect. Consistent with this finding , the mRNA levels of IFN-α-induced IRF-7 in PBMCs were positively correlated with HbA1c levels of diabetes patients. Additionally , we found that high glucose promoted the production of other proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. This study suggests that hyperglycemia may affect the inflammatory process in diabetes via promoting proinflammatory cytokines , as well as the host defense against microbial infections through impeding type I IFN production and signaling.
