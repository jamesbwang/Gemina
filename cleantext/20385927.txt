  Aortic valve-in-valve implantation for prosthetic valve dysfunction is a good alternative to reoperative valve replacement. There are some limitations to this approach including the risk of coronary occlusion , patient prosthesis mismatch , and valve malposition. The incidence of coronary occlusion is higher in aortic valve-in-valve than de novo aortic stenosis cases. Multiple factors can contribute to this complication , and the type of bioprosthesis has been implicated. We examined our experience of 80 aortic valve-in-valve cases with internally and externally mounted leaflet valves. Procedural success was achieved in 95 % of cases with an overall 30-day mortality of 1.3 %. Clinical and procedural outcomes were similar in the both cohorts. Our data suggest that aortic valve-in-valve implantation can be safely performed in carefully selected patient with internally and externally mounted leaflet bioprosthesis.
