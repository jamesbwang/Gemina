  Physical activity ( PA) protects against a wide range of diseases. Habitual PA appears to be heritable , motivating the search for specific genetic variants that may inform efforts to promote PA and target the best type of PA for each individual. We used data from the UK Biobank to perform the largest genome-wide association study of PA to date , using three measures based on self-report ( n We identified ten loci across all PA measures that were significant in both a basic and a fully adjusted model ( p < 5 Ã— 10 These results provide new insight into the genetic basis of habitual PA , and the genetic links connecting PA with other traits and diseases.
