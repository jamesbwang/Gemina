  Enhanced recovery after surgery programs may improve recovery and reduce duration of hospital stay after joint replacement surgery. However , uptake is incomplete , and the relative importance of program components is unknown. This before-and-after quality improvement study was designed to determine whether adding ` non-surgical ' components , to pre-existing ` surgical ' components , in an Australian private healthcare setting , would improve patient recovery after total hip replacement. We prospectively collected data regarding care processes and health outcomes of 115 consecutive patients undergoing hip replacement with a single surgeon in a private hospital in Melbourne , Australia. Based on this data , a multidisciplinary team ( surgeon , anesthetists , nurse unit managers , physiotherapists , perioperative physician) chose and implemented 12 ` non-surgical ' program components. Identical data were collected from a further 115 consecutive patients. The primary outcome measure was Quality of Recovery-15 score at 6 weeks postoperatively; the linear regression model was adjusted for baseline group differences. The majority of health outcomes , including the primary outcome measure , were similar in pre- and post-implementation groups ( quality of recovery score , pain rating and disability score , at time-points up to six weeks postoperatively). The proportion of patients with zero oral morphine equivalent consumption at six weeks increased from 57 to 80 % ( RR 1.34 , 95 % CI 1.13 , 1.58). Mean ( SD) length of hospital stay decreased from 5.94 ( 5.21) to 5.02 ( 2.46) days but was not statistically significant once adjusted for baseline group differences. Four of ten measurable program components were successfully implemented. Antiemetic prophylaxis increased by 53 % ( risk ratio ( RR) 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.16 , 2.02). Tranexamic acid use increased by 41 % ( RR 95 % CI 1.18 , 1.68). Postoperative physiotherapy treatment on the day of surgery increased by 87 % ( RR 95 % CI 1.36 , 2.59). Postoperative patient mobilisation â‰¥ three metres on the day of surgery increased by 151 % ( RR 95 % CI 1.27 , 4.97). Implementation of a full enhanced recovery after surgery program , and optimal choice of program components , remains a challenge. Improved implementation of non-surgical components of a program may further reduce duration of acute hospital stay , while maintaining quality of recovery.
