  To examine whether regional practice patterns impact racial/ethnic differences in intensity of end-of-life care for cancer decedents. The linked Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results ( SEER)- Medicare database. We classified hospital referral regions ( HRRs) based on mean 6-month end-of-life care expenditures , which represented regional practice patterns. Using hierarchical generalized linear models , we examined racial/ethnic differences in the intensity of end-of-life care across levels of HRR expenditures. There was greater variation in intensity of end-of-life care among Hispanics , Asians , and whites in high-expenditure HRRs than in low-expenditure HRRs. Local practice patterns may influence racial/ethnic differences in end-of-life care.
