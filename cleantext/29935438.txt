  Stem cells which defined by dual features of self-renewal and differentiation potential provide a unique source for repairing damaged tissues to treat a wide spectrum of diseases and injuries. Several recent studies suggest that Resveratrol ( RSV) , a natural polyphenol component , possesses the ability to improve either culture conditions of stem cells or their target differentiation in culture. This review covers the literature that deals with the effects of RSV and its underlying mechanisms on survival , self-renewal and lineage commitment of various stem cells. Concentration of RSV and duration of treatment with this component could exert differential effects on cellular differentiation processes and cell fate. Therefore , RSV could be accounted as an effective small molecule for a variety of cell therapies which should be implemented by a special care considering , effective concentration and duration of exposure.
