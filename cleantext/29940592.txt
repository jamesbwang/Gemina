  The SERVE-HF study has raised questions concerning the higher mortality under adaptive servoventilation. The ventilatory mode was discussed as a possible aggravating factor. We wondered if the data recorded by the adaptive servo-ventilation ( ASV)- devices in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients with CSA-CSR ± OSA are different in terms of respiratory parameters and therapeutic pressures compared to patients with CPAP-resistant/emergent-CSA with normal BNP/NT-pro-BNP. Patients were included , if ASV had normalized respiratory disturbance index in the first night of application and after at least 6 weeks. ASV-device data were analyzed in terms of respiratory rate ( RR) , min ventilation ( MV) , endexpiratory ( EEP) , peak inspiratory pressure ( Ppeak) and median pressure. Compared to CPAP-resistant/emergent-CSA with normal BNP/NT-pro-BNP ( n = 25) , CSA-CSR- ( n = 13) CSA-CSR + OSA-patients ( n = 32) with elevated BNP/NT-pro-BNP had higher RR ( p < 0.01) in the first night of ASV therapy and during follow-up ( 15.3 ± 1.3 vs. 17.3 ± 2.4/ min) with similar MV ( 6.5 ± 1.3 vs. 6.6 ± 1.3 L) , resulting in significantly lower tidal volumes. EEP ( 5.6 ± 1.1 vs. 5.5 ± 1.1 hPa) , Pmedian and Ppeak ( 9.8 ± 1.5 vs. 9.7 ± 1.2 hPa) were comparable. Ventilatory parameters were not different between LVEF < 40 , 40-49 , and ≥ 50 % , neither within the whole group nor the group of CSA-CSR ± OSA and heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and CSA-CSR ± OSA have higher RRs but similar MV under ASV-therapy than patients with CSA and normal BNP. This indicates higher dead space ventilation. EF was not found to have an influence on the ventilatory parameters.
