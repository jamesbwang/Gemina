  A new form of generator known as the triboelectric nanogenerator ( TENG) has recently been suggested as a simple and low-cost solution to scavenge ambient mechanical energy. Although there have been substantial advances in TENGs over the past few years , the power efficiency of TENGs must be enhanced further before they can be practically applied. In the present study , we report a ferromagnetic nanoparticle-embedded hybrid nanogenerator ( FHNG) which operates based on both triboelectricity and electromagnetic induction. A TENG and an electromagnetic generator ( EMG) efficiently cooperate to generate electrical energy from the same motion , i.e. , the vibration of a synthesized nanoparticle. A surface-functionalized ferric oxide nanoparticle , which has strong ferromagnetism and high triboelectricity , was produced by a simple surface-coating process. The measured electrical characteristics revealed that the output voltage of both the TENG and the EMG components increased by approximately 50 times and by twofold , respectively , after the surface functionalization step. Moreover , when constant vibration of 3 Hz is applied to the fabricated FHNG , the TENG and EMG components correspondingly generated output power of 133.2 μW at a load resistance of 100 MΩ and 6.5 μW at a load resistance of 200 Ω. The output power per unit mass from the FHNG is greater than that according to the arithmetic sum of the individual TENG and EMG components , demonstrating synergy between the two components. Furthermore , the device can generate stable output under various vibration directions , amplitudes , and frequencies due to the fluid-like characteristics of the powder. The packaged structure also securely protects the device from external humidity and dust. Connected to a rationally designed power management circuit , a digital clock was turned on solely by the fabricated FHNG.
