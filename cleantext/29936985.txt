  Medical student evaluations of faculty are increasingly incorporated into promotion and tenure decisions , making it imperative to understand learner perceptions of quality teaching. Prior work has shown that students value faculty responsiveness in the form of feedback , but faculty and students differ in their perceptions of what constitutes sufficient feedback. The innovative minute feedback system ( MFS) can quantify responsiveness to students ' feedback requests. This study assessed how feedback provision via MFS impacts teaching quality scores. This retrospective observational study compared average faculty teaching quality scores with faculty 's percentage response to student feedback requests via the MFS. The data were generated from the core surgical clerkship for third-year medical students at the University of Michigan Medical School. The relationship between average teaching quality scores and response percentage was assessed by weighted regression analysis. Two hundred thirty-seven medical students requested feedback via MFS , and 104 faculty were evaluated on teaching quality. The mean faculty feedback response percentage was 55.78 %. The mean teaching quality score was 4.27 on a scale of 1 to 5. Teaching quality score was significantly correlated with response percentage ( P < 0.001); for every 10 % increase in response percentage , average teaching quality score improved by 0.075. Average teaching quality score was not significantly associated with response time ( P = 0.158) , gender ( P = 0.407) , or surgical service ( P = 0.498). Medical students consider responsiveness to feedback requests an important component of quality teaching. Furthermore , faculty development focused on efficient and practical feedback strategies may have the added benefit of improving their teaching quality.
