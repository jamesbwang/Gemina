  Despite tremendous research efforts focused on diagnosis and treatment , pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States , with a 5-year overall survival rate of less than 5 %. Although resistance is rather complex , emerging evidence has demonstrated that epigenetic alterations ( e.g. miRNA) have important roles in PDAC progression as well as resistance to therapy. Certain miRNAs have been identified as potential prognostic biomarkers in PDAC. In this review , we summarize the recent developments in miRNA research related to PDAC therapeutic resistance mechanisms and the potential of miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers for future clinical management of PDAC.
