  To evaluate remodeling of the corneal epithelium after epithelium-off corneal cross-linking ( CXL). In this prospective single-center study , 93 eyes of 93 patients with progressive keratoconus underwent standard CXL. The maximum keratometry was assessed before and after CXL with Scheimpflug imaging , and the epithelial thickness profile across the central 5 mm of the cornea was assessed with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography anterior segment imaging. The mean patient age was 27 ± 11 years; 76 patients ( 81 %) were male and 17 ( 19 %) were female. Between baseline and 6 months after CXL , the mean corneal maximum keratometry flattened from 58.90 to 57.80 diopters ( P < .0001). The mean minimum epithelial thickness increased slightly ( from 41 ± 6 to 42 ± 7 μm , P = .12) , whereas the mean maximum epithelial thickness decreased slightly ( from 65 ± 6 to 64 ± 7 μm , P = .067) , reducing the net difference between the minimum and maximum epithelial thickness ( from 24 ± 9 to 22 ± 9 μm , P = .0023). The difference between the minimum and maximum epithelial thickness was strongly positively correlated with the maximum keratometry reading at baseline ( R Epithelium-off CXL resulted in modest regularization of the epithelial thickness profile across the central 5 mm of the cornea at 6 months. This could slightly mask flattening of the underlying stroma. ( J Refract Surg. 2018; 34 ( 6): 408-412.).
