  Percutaneous core-needle biopsy ( PCNB) is the standard of care to biopsy and diagnose suspicious breast lesions<symptom>. Dependent on histology , many patients require additional open procedures for definitive diagnosis and excision. This study estimated the payer and patient out-of-pocket ( OOP) costs , and complication risk , among those requiring at least 1 open procedure following PCNB. This retrospective study used the Truven Commercial database ( 2009-2014). Women who underwent PCNB , with continuous insurance , and no history of cancer , chemotherapy , radiation , or breast surgery in the prior year were included. Open procedures were defined as open biopsy or lumpectomy. Study follow-up ended at chemotherapy , radiation , mastectomy , or 90 days-whichever occurred first. In total , 143771 patients ( mean age 48) met selection criteria; 85.1 % underwent isolated PCNB , 12.4 % one open procedure , and 2.5 % re-excision. Incidence of complications was significantly lower among those with PCNB alone ( 9.2 %) vs 1 open procedure ( 15.6 %) or re-excision ( 25.3 % , A meaningful proportion of patients underwent open procedure ( s) following PCNB which was associated with increased complication risk and costs to both the payer and the patient. These results suggest a need for technologies to reduce the proportion of cases requiring open surgery and , in some cases , re-excision.
