  Sex determination is remarkably dynamic; many taxa display shifts in the location of sex-determining loci or the evolution of entirely new sex-determining systems. Predominant theories for why we observe such transitions generally conclude that novel sex-determining systems are favoured by selection if they equalise the sex ratio or increase linkage with a locus that experiences different selection in males versus females. We use population genetic models to extend these theories in two ways: ( 1) We consider the dynamics of loci very tightly linked to the ancestral sex-determining loci , e.g. , within the nonrecombining region of the ancestral sex chromosomes. Variation at such loci can favour the spread of new sex-determining systems in which the heterogametic sex changes ( XY to ZW or ZW to XY) and the new sex-determining region is less closely linked ( or even unlinked) to the locus under selection. ( 2) We consider selection upon haploid genotypes either during gametic competition ( e.g. , pollen competition) or meiosis ( i.e. , nonmendelian segregation) , which can cause the zygotic sex ratio to become biased. Haploid selection can drive transitions between sex-determining systems without requiring selection to act differently in diploid males versus females. With haploid selection , we find that transitions between male and female heterogamety can evolve so that linkage with the sex-determining locus is either strengthened or weakened. Furthermore , we find that sex ratio biases may increase or decrease with the spread of new sex chromosomes , which implies that transitions between sex-determining systems can not be simply predicted by selection to equalise the sex ratio. In fact , under many conditions , we find that transitions in sex determination are favoured equally strongly in cases in which the sex ratio bias increases or decreases. Overall , our models predict that sex determination systems should be highly dynamic , particularly when haploid selection is present , consistent with the evolutionary lability of this trait in many taxa.
