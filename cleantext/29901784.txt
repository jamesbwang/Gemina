  The origin of flower scents is a crucial event in biological evolution , which provides olfactory signals to attract pollinators. In this study , bioinformatic , metabolomics , biochemical and molecular methodologies were integrated to investigate the candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of volatile components ( VOCs) in two cultivars of Freesia hybrida , Red River Â® and Ambiance , which released different categories of compounds. We found that terpene synthase ( TPS) genes were the pivotal genes determining spatiotemporal release of the VOCs in both cultivars. Eight FhTPS genes were isolated and six were found to be functional: FhTPS1 was a single product enzyme catalyzing the formation of linalool , whereas the other four FhTPS proteins were multi-product enzymes , in which FhTPS4 , FhTPS6 and FhTPS7 could recognize GPP and FPP simultaneously. In brief , FhTPS enzymatic products closely matched the volatile terpenes emitted from flowers , and significant correlations were found between VOCs release and FhTPS gene expression. Based on these results , graphical models were proposed to summarize the biosynthesis of Freesia floral volatile terpenes. The characterization of FhTPS genes paves the way to decipher their roles in speciation and fitness of the Freesia species , and this knowledge could also be used to introduce or enhance scent in other plants.
