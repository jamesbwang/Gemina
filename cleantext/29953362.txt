  Eleven strains of an entomopathogenic fungus , isolated and identified as Ophiocordyceps sobolifera , were screened for activity against 5 strains of Gram-negative and 5 strains of Gram-positive bacteria. Four of the isolates , Cod-KK1634 , Cod-KK1643 , Cod-KS1601 , and Cod-SN1626 , had activity against the test strains of Grampositive bacteria. Of these 4 extracts , the Cod-KK1643 extract had the lowest minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations. The Cod-KK1643 extract exhibited both concentration- and time-dependent bactericidal activity. Moreover , the Cod-KK1643 extract induced morphological alterations in bacterial cells , including decreased cell size , a crushed appearance , and cell lysis. It is surprising to note that the extracts also inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation , with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 47.09 Â± 33.64 mg/mL after 72 hours. The extracts also inhibited MCF-7 cell migration , with the lowest percentage of relative closure achieved with Cod-KK1643. These findings represent what is to our knowledge the first information on the activities of O. sobolifera mycelial extracts against bacteria and the human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line.
