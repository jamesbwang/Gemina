  Enteral feeding via feeding tube ( FT) provides essential nutrition support to critically ill patients or those who can not intake adequate nutrition via the oral route. Unfortunately , 1 % -2 % of FTs placed blindly at bedside enter the airway undetected ( as confirmed by x-ray) , where they could result in adverse events. Misplaced FTs can cause complications including pneumothorax , vocal cord injury , bronchopleural fistula<disease> , pneumonia<disease> , and death. X-ray is typically performed to confirm FT placement before feeding , but may delay nutrition intake , may not universally identify misplacement , and adds cost and radiation exposure. A prospective case series was conducted to evaluate a novel FT with a camera to provide real-time visualization , guiding placement. The primary end point was the clinician 's ability to identify anatomical markers in the gastrointestinal tract and/or airway using the camera. The Kangaroo Feeding Tube with IRIS Technology tube was placed in 45 subjects with 1 misplaced tube; 3 placements were postpyloric , with the remainder gastric. Clinicians correctly identified the stomach in 44 of 45 placements at a median depth of 60.0 cm ( range 45.0-85.0 cm). A stomach image was obtained in 42 subjects ( 93.3 %). Agreement between camera image and radiographic confirmation of placement was 93 % ( P = .014) with small deviations in recognizing stomach vs small bowel. No device-related adverse events occurred. Direct visualization of the stomach using a camera-equipped FT can assist with FT placement , help avoid misplacements , and with further studies to evaluate the safety of eliminating confirmatory x-ray before feeding , could potentially preclude the need for radiographic confirmation.
