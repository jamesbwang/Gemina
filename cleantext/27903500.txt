  Immune checkpoint blockade therapies ( ICBTs) targeting programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1) and its ligand programmed death ligand-1 ( PD-L1/ B7-H1/ CD274) have exhibited momentous clinical benefits and durable responses in multiple tumor types. However , primary resistance is found in considerable number of cancer patients , and most responders eventually develop acquired resistance to ICBT. To tackle these challenges , it is essential to understand how PD-L1 is controlled by cancer cells to evade immune surveillance. Recent research has shed new light into the mechanisms of PD-L1 regulation at genetic , epigenetic , transcriptional , translational , and posttranslational levels. In this work , we systematically discuss the mechanisms that control the gene amplification , epigenetic alteration , transcription , subcellular transportation and posttranscriptional modification of PD-L1 in cancer cells. We further categorize posttranscriptional PD-L1 regulations by the molecular modification of PD-L1 , including glycosylation , phosphorylation , ubiquitination , deubiquitination , and lysosomal degradation. These findings may provide new routes for targeting tumor immune escape and catalyze the development of small molecular inhibitors of PD-L1 in addition to existing antibody drugs.
