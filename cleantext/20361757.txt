  Resistive pressure sensors generally employ microstructures such as pores and pyramids in the active layer or on the electrodes to reduce the Young & rsquo; s modulus and improve the sensitivity. However , such pressure sensors always exhibit complex fabrication process and have difficulties in controlling the uniformity of microstructures. In this paper , we demonstrated a highly sensitive resistive pressure sensor based on a composite comprising of low-polarity liquid crystal ( LPLC) , multi-walled carbon nanotube ( MWCNT) , and polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS) elastomer. The LPLC in the PDMS forms a polymer-dispersed liquid crystal ( PDLC) structure which can not only reduce the Young & rsquo; s modulus but also contribute to the construction of conductive paths in the active layer. By optimizing the concentration of LC in PDMS elastomer , the resistive pressure sensor shows a high sensitivity of 5.35 kPa
