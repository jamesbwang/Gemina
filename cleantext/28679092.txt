  Immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICI) have widely reshaped the treatment paradigm of advanced cancer patients. Although multiple studies are currently evaluating these drugs as monotherapies or in combination , the choice of the most accurate statistical methods , endpoints and clinical trial designs to estimate the benefit of ICI remains an unsolved methodological issue. Considering the unconventional patterns of response or progression ( i.e. , pseudoprogression , hyperprogression ( HPD)) observed with ICI , the application in clinical trials of novel response assessment tools ( i.e. , iRECIST) able to capture delayed benefit of immunotherapies and/or to quantify tumor dynamics and kinetics over time is an unmet clinical need. In addition , the proportional hazard model and the conventional measures of survival ( i.e. , median overall or progression free survival ( PFS) and hazard ratios ( HR)) might usually result inadequate in the estimation of the long-term benefit observed with ICI. For this reason , innovative methodologies such as milestone analysis , restricted mean survival time ( RMST) , parametric models ( i.e. , Weibull distribution , weighted log rank test) , should be systematically investigated in clinical trials in order to adequately quantify the fraction of patients who are `` cured '' , represented by the tails of the survival curves. Regarding predictive biomarkers , in particular PD-L1 expression , the integration and harmonization of the existing assays are urgently needed to provide clinicians with reliable diagnostic tests and to improve patient selection for immunotherapy. Finally , developing original and high-quality study designs , such as adaptive or basket biomarker enriched clinical trials , included in large collaborative platforms with multiple active sites and cross-sector collaboration , represents the successful strategy to optimally assess the benefit of ICI in the next future.
