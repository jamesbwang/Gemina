  Described herein is a clinical case report regarding successful endovascular treatment of a patient presenting with an abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> combined with occlusion of one of the iliac arteries. Cases concerning elimination of such pathology appear to be reported only sporadically in the available literature. The patient underwent reconstructive repair in two stages. The first stage comprised recanalization with stenting of the occluded iliac artery on the right and implantation of the Zenith stent graft. The findings of intraoperative check angiography showed no evidence of endoleak , with the preserved patency of both the stent graft and iliac arteries on the right. The second stage consisted of balloon angioplasty of stenosis of the external iliac artery on the left. The results of the follow-up examination at 3 years showed that the iliac arteries on both sides and the aortic endograft were free from significant stenoses , with no evidence of endoleaks.
