  During CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing , site-specific double strand breaks are introduced and repaired either unspecific by non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ) or sequence dependent by homology directed repair ( HDR). Whereas NHEJ-based generation of gene knock-out is widely performed , the HDR-based knock-in of specific mutations remains a bottleneck. Especially in primary cell lines that are essential for the generation of cell culture and animal models of inherited human<disease> diseases<disease> , knock-in efficacy is insufficient and needs significant improvement. Here , we tested two different approaches to increase the knock-in frequency of a specific point mutation into the
