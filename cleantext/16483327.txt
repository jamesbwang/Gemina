  Although cadaveric dissection has historically been the cornerstone of anatomical education , it comes at the cost of some emotional , moral , safety , and environmental concerns. Computer assisted learning ( CAL) programs are an increasingly common solution to these issues; however , research regarding the efficacy of high fidelity simulation is limited. The traditional first semester veterinary gross anatomy course curriculum at Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine ( RUSVM) was supplemented with a web based virtual anatomy program , IVALA & trade; ( www.ivalalearn.com). The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between supplementary use of the IVALA & trade; program and student examination scores , and to measure student perception surrounding IVALA & trade;. IVALA & trade; uses an interactive virtual canine specimen that enables students to identify , move , rotate , magnify , and remove individual anatomic structures while providing a text description of each selected anatomic point. Fifty-six first semester RUSVM students who supplemented their anatomic learning with the IVALA & trade; program performed significantly higher on examinations compared to students ( n = 123) that did not (
