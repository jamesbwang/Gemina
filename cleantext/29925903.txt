  Growth factor independent 1 ( Gfi1) controls myeloid differentiation by regulating gene expression and limits the activation of p53 by facilitating its de-methylation at Lysine 372. In human myeloid leukemia<disease> , low GFI1 levels correlate with an inferior prognosis. Here , we show that knockdown ( KD) of Gfi1 in mice causes a fatal myeloproliferative disease ( MPN) that could progress to leukemia<disease> after additional mutations. Both KO and KD mice accumulate myeloid cells that show signs of metabolic stress and high levels of reactive oxygen species. However , only KO cells have elevated levels of Lysine 372 methylated p53. This suggests that in contrast to absence of GFI1 , KD of GFI1 leads to the accumulation of myeloid cells because sufficient amount of GFI1 is present to impede p53-mediated cell death , leading to a fatal MPN. The combination of myeloid accumulation and the ability to counteract p53 activity under metabolic stress could explain the role of reduced GF1 expression in human myeloid
