  Negative pressure wound<disease> therapy ( NPWT) is a novel tool to reduce surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> ( SSIs). Although SSIs are a common source of morbidity in infants undergoing laparotomy , the cost of the available NPWT devices has restricted its use to adult high-risk patients. We developed a low-cost method of NPWT in infants and analyzed its impact on the incidence of SSIs in infant patients. A consecutive series of infants ( age â‰¤ 12 months) who underwent a clean-contaminated , contaminated , or dirty abdominal procedure via laparotomy from 08/2015 to 12/2016 were included. The choice of the applied dressing , either NPWT or standard surgical dressing ( SSD) , was made at the surgeon 's discretion. SSIs were documented prospectively. The Horan definition and the Clavien-Dindo classification were used. The cost of material was calculated for both groups. Ninety-three consecutive patients were included ( 65 SSD and 28 NPWT). SSI occurred in 10 patients in the SSD group , Grade I in 7 and Grade II in 3 ( Clavien-Dindo classification). No SSI occurred in patients with NPWT ( The routine use of this modified vacuum wound<disease> dressing may be an efficient and affordable technique to decrease SSIs in infants who underwent contaminated abdominal operations.
