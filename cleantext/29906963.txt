  Nematic films are thin fluid structures , ideally two dimensional , endowed with an in-plane degenerate nematic order. In this paper we examine a generalization of the classical Plateau problem to an axisymmetric nematic film bounded by two coaxial parallel rings. At equilibrium , the shape of the nematic film results from the competition between surface tension , which favors the minimization of the area , and the nematic elasticity , which instead promotes the alignment of the molecules along a common direction. We find two classes of equilibrium solutions in which the molecules are uniformly aligned along the meridians or parallels. Depending on two dimensionless parameters , one related to the geometry of the film and the other to the constitutive moduli , the Gaussian curvature of the equilibrium shape may be everywhere negative , vanishing , or positive. The stability of these equilibrium configurations is investigated.
