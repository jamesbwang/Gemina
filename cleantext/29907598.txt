  Tumors with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase ( ALK) fusion rearrangements , including non-small cell lung cancer and anaplastic large cell lymphoma , are highly sensitive to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs) , underscoring the notion that such cancers are addicted to ALK activity. While mutations in ALK are heavily implicated in childhood neuroblastoma , response to the ALK TKI crizotinib has been disappointing. Embryonal tumors in patients with DNA repair defects such as Fanconi anemia<symptom> ( FA) often have a poor prognosis , due to lack of therapeutic options. Here we report a child with underlying FA and ALK mutant high-risk neuroblastoma responding strongly to precision therapy with the ALK TKI ceritinib. Conventional chemotherapy treatment caused severe , life-threatening toxicity. Genomic analysis of the initial biopsy identified germ-line FANCA mutations as well as a novel ALK-I1171T variant. ALK-I1171T generates a potent gain-of-function mutant , as measured in PC12 cell neurite outgrowth and NIH3T3 transformation. Pharmacological inhibition profiling of ALK-I1171T in response to various ALK TKIs identified an 11-fold improved inhibition of ALK-I1171T with ceritinib when compared with crizotinib. Immunoaffinity-coupled LC-MS/MS phosphoproteomics analysis indicated a decrease in ALK signaling in response to ceritinib. Ceritinib was therefore selected for treatment in this child. Mono-therapy with ceritinib was well tolerated and resulted in normalized catecholamine markers and tumor shrinkage. After 7.5 months treatment , residual primary tumor was surgically removed and exhibited hallmarks of differentiation together with reduced Ki67 levels. Clinical follow-up after 21 months treatment revealed complete clinical remission including all metastatic sites. Therefore , ceritinib presents a viable therapeutic option for ALK-positive neuroblastoma.
