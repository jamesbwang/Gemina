  Despite the advent of cinacalcet and noncalcium-containing phosphate binders , controlling the progression of vascular calcification ( VC) is still challenging. Recent reports demonstrate that carbamylation driven by high urea concentration aggravates VC , suggesting the importance of adequate dialysis in retarding its progression. Theoretically , other promising measures include the use of iron-based phosphate binders , vitamin K , and magnesium supplements , which should be investigated in future randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) , ideally with hard outcomes. While incidence of hip fracture in patients on dialysis is decreasing in the United States and Japan ( possibly owing to better control of PTH levels by cinacalcet) it remains much higher than that in the general population. Many drugs used in the treatment of osteoporosis , including bisphosphonate , raloxifene , denosumab , and teriparatide can , under specific conditions , increase bone mineral density ( BMD) , which is associated with a lower fracture rate. However , the efficacy of these drugs in reducing the fracture rate remains to be proven in hemodialysis ( HD) patients , given their adverse effects such as severe hypocalcemia and resultant worsening of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Some clinical studies have shown that cinacalcet , lanthanum carbonate , and sevelamer reduce mortality in elderly patients on HD , suggesting the benefits of reducing PTH and serum phosphate levels. However , the target ranges of PTH and phosphate levels are based solely on observational studies. This is also the case when treating low PTH levels by decreasing vitamin D or calcium load. RCTs with hard clinical endpoints comparing different targets are necessary in the future.
