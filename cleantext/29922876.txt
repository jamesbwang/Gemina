  The aim of this work was to predict the permeability of two model drugs , sulfamerazine ( SMR) and indomethacin ( INM) , and to determine the effect on their apparent permeabilities by complexation with cyclodextrins and/or meglumine or incorporation in microemulsions. Permeation experiments were performed using two-chamber diffusion cells with a new composition of bio-mimetic membrane composed of 80 % of Lipoid ® S100 and 20 % of cholesterol in n-octanol 10 % w/w solution , at 37 ± 0.5 °C and 14,000 rpm. The predictive capacity of the permeability of passive diffusion absorbed compounds was evaluated using 20 drug standards and showed an exponential correlation between the apparent permeability coefficients ( P
