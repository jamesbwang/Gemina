  Photocatalysis directed at the removal of persistent organic pollutants , including pharmaceuticals , has been the subject of intense recent research. Bismuth oxychloride ( BiOCl) has emerged as a potential alternative to traditional photocatalysts and has shown competitive removal efficiencies. However , pathways responsible for BiOCl photodegradation have not been well characterized. The present work is the first to determine , using LC-MS/MS analysis , the pathways by which BiOCl removes ibuprofen ( IBP) from water. HPLC-DAD and LC-MS/MS analyses show that BiOCl converts IBP to two primary photochemical products , 4-isobutylacetophenone ( IBAP) and 1- ( 4-isobutylphenyl) ethanol ( IBPE). The reactivity for BiOCl is attributed to interactions of the carboxylic acid group of IBP with holes in the valence band. Hydroxylated-IBP was not detected in BiOCl photocatalytic degradation experiments which would be expected in a process driven by the formation and reactivity of reactive oxygen species. These data were used to formulate a photocatalytic degradation pathway for IBP and highlight the importance of studying both primary and secondary degradation reactions for photocatalytic studies.
