  This paper proposes a model-based family of detection and quantification statistics to evaluate response bias in item bundles of any size. Compensatory ( CDRF) and non-compensatory ( NCDRF) response bias measures are proposed , along with their sample realizations and large-sample variability when models are fitted using multiple-group estimation. Based on the underlying connection to item response theory estimation methodology , it is argued that these new statistics provide a powerful and flexible approach to studying response bias for categorical response data over and above methods that have previously appeared in the literature. To evaluate their practical utility , CDRF and NCDRF are compared to the closely related SIBTEST family of statistics and likelihood-based detection methods through a series of Monte Carlo simulations. Results indicate that the new statistics are more optimal effect size estimates of marginal response bias than the SIBTEST family , are competitive with a selection of likelihood-based methods when studying item-level bias , and are the most optimal when studying differential bundle and test bias.
