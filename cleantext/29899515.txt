  Surface layers ( S-layers) are two-dimensional , proteinaceous , porous lattices that form the outermost cell envelope component of virtually all archaea and many bacteria. Despite exceptional sequence diversity , S-layer proteins ( SLPs) share important characteristics such as their ability to form crystalline sheets punctuated with nano-scale pores , and their propensity for charged amino acids , leading to acidic or basic isoelectric points. However , the precise function of S-layers , or the role of charged SLPs and how they relate to cellular metabolism is unknown. Nano-scale lattices affect the diffusion behavior of low-concentration solutes , even if they are significantly smaller than the pore size. Here , we offer a rationale for charged S-layer proteins in the context of the structural evolution of S-layers. Using the ammonia-oxidizing archaea ( AOA) as a model for S-layer geometry , and a 2D electrodiffusion reaction computational framework to simulate diffusion and consumption of the charged solute ammonium ( NH
