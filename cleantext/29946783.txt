  Although tumorigenesis has classically been regarded as a genetic disease of uncontrolled cell growth , the importance of the tumor microenvironment ( TME) is continuously emphasized by the accumulating evidence that cancer growth is not simply dependent on the cancer cells themselves ( 1 , 2) but also dependent on angiogenesis ( 3-- 6) , inflammation<symptom> ( 7 , 8) , and the supporting roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts ( CAFs) ( 9 , 10). After the discovery that CAFs are able to remodel the tumor matrix within the TME and provide the nutrients and chemicals to promote cancer cell growth ( 11) , many studies have aimed to uncover the cross talk between cancer and CAFs. Moreover , a new paradigm in cancer metabolism shows how cancer cells act like `` metabolic parasites '' to uptake the high-energy metabolites , such as lactate , ketone bodies , free fatty acid , and glutamine from supporting cells , including CAFs and cancer-associated adipocytes ( CAAs) ( 12 , 13). This chapter provides an overview of the metabolic coupling between CAFs and cancer to further define the therapeutic options to disrupt the CAF-cancer cell interactions.
