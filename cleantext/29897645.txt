  Iron has long been implicated in many neurological and other organ diseases. It is known that over and above the normal increases in iron with age , in certain diseases there is an excessive iron accumulation in the brain and liver. MRI is a noninvasive means by which to image the various structures in the brain in three dimensions and quantify iron over the volume of the object of interest. The quantification of iron can provide information about the severity of iron-related diseases as well as quantify changes in iron for patient follow-up and treatment monitoring. This article provides an overview of current MRI-based methods for iron quantification , specifically for the brain and liver , including: signal intensity ratio , R 5 Technical Efficacy: Stage 5 J.
