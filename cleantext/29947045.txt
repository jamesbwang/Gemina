  To replicate the well-established association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus beta blockers and angioedema in the International Classification of Diseases , 10th Revision , Clinical Modification ( ICD-10-CM) era. We conducted a retrospective , inception cohort study in a large insurance database formatted to the Sentinel Common Data Model. We defined study periods spanning the ICD-9-CM era only , ICD-10-CM era only , and ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM era and conducted simple-forward mapping ( SFM) , simple-backward mapping ( SBM) , and forward-backward mapping ( FBM) referencing the General Equivalence Mappings to translate the outcome ( angioedema) and covariates from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM. We performed propensity score ( PS)- matched and PS-stratified Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios ( HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). In the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM eras spanning April 1 to September 30 of 2015 and 2016 , there were 152 017 and 145 232 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor initiators and 115 073 and 116 652 beta-blocker initiators , respectively. The PS-matched HR was 4.19 ( 95 % CI , 2.82-6.23) in the ICD-9-CM era , 4.37 ( 2.92-6.52) in the ICD-10-CM era using SFM , and 4.64 ( 3.05-7.07) in the ICD-10-CM era using SBM and FBM. The PS-matched HRs from the mixed ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM eras ranged from 3.91 ( 2.69-5.68) to 4.35 ( 3.33-5.70). The adjusted HRs across different diagnostic coding eras and the use of SFM versus SBM and FBM produced numerically different but clinically similar results. Additional investigations as ICD-10-CM data accumulate are warranted.
