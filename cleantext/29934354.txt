  Many neural networks are multitasking and receive modulatory input , which configures activity. As a result , these networks can enter a relatively persistent state in which they are biased to generate one type of output as opposed to another. A question we address is as follows: what happens to this type of state when the network is forced to task-switch? We address this question in the feeding system of the
