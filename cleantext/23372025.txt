  Aging is one of the most prominent features in recent population dynamics around the world. As populations age , the prevalence of simultaneous chronic<disease> diseases<disease> increases , which is known as multimorbidity. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of multimorbidity and associated factors in a sample of elderly Mexican subjects. A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on a convenience sample of 139 subjects aged ≥ 60 years. The dependent variable was the multimorbidity diagnosis performed by a physician , which was categorized as 0 for subjects with no chronic<disease> disease<disease> or only 1 disease and 1 for subjects with 2 or more chronic<disease> diseases<disease>. Questionnaires were used to collect the information on the different variables. A statistical analysis was performed in Stata 11.0. The mean age was 79.06 ± 9.78 years , and 69.1 % of the subjects were women. A total of 69.1 % ( 95 % confidence interval = 61.3-76.8) reported at least 1 morbidity. The mean morbidity by subject was 1.04 ± 1.90. Cardiovascular diseases ( 25.9 %) , hypertension ( 20.1 %) , musculoskeletal disorders ( 19.4 %) , and diabetes ( 13.7 %) were the most frequently reported conditions. The prevalence of multimorbidity ( 2 or more diseases) was 27.3 % ( 95 % confidence interval = 19.8-34.8). No significant differences were observed in the independent variables. In conclusion , the prevalence of multimorbidity in this sample of elderly Mexican subjects was relatively low. The distribution across the included variables was not significantly different. Interventions focused on the health care of older adults with multimorbidity should pay special attention to cardiovascular diseases , hypertension , and musculoskeletal disorders.
