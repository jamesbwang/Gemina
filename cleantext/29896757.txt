  To evaluate the safety and usability of a wearable , waterproof high-definition camera/case for acquisition of surgical images by sterile personnel. An in vitro study to test the efficacy of biodecontamination of camera cases. Usability for intraoperative image acquisition was assessed in clinical procedures. Two waterproof GoPro Hero4 Silver camera cases were inoculated by immersion in media containing Staphylococcus<pathogen> pseudointermedius or Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> at â‰¥ 5.50 E +07 colony forming units/mL. Cases were biodecontaminated by manual washing and hydrogen peroxide plasma sterilization. Cultures were obtained by swab and by immersion in enrichment broth before and after each contamination/decontamination cycle ( n = 4). The cameras were then applied by a surgeon in clinical procedures by using either a headband or handheld mode and were assessed for usability according to 5 user characteristics. Cultures of all poststerilization swabs were negative. One of 8 cultures was positive in enrichment broth , consistent with a low level of contamination in 1 sample. Usability of the camera was considered poor in headband mode , with limited battery life , inability to control camera functions , and lack of zoom function affecting image quality. Handheld operation of the camera by the primary surgeon improved usability , allowing close-up still and video intraoperative image acquisition. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide sterilization of this camera case was considered effective for biodecontamination. Handheld operation improved usability for intraoperative image acquisition. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide sterilization and thorough manual washing of a waterproof camera may provide cost effective intraoperative image acquisition for documentation purposes.
