  The exploration of novel molecular architectures is crucial for the design of high-performance ambipolar polymer semiconductors. Here , a `` triple-acceptors architecture '' strategy to design the ambipolar polymer DPP-2T-DPP-TBT is introduced. The utilization of this architecture enables DPP-2T-DPP-TBT to achieve deep-lying highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO)/ lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO) levels of -5.38/ -4.19 eV , and strong intermolecular interactions , which are favorable for hole/electron injection and intermolecular hopping through Ï€-stacking. All these factors result in excellent ambipolar transport characteristics and promising applications in complementary-like circuits for DPP-2T-DPP-TBT under ambient conditions with high hole/electron mobilities and a gain value of up to 3.01/ 3.84 cm
