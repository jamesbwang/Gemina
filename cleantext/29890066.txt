  Adsorption onto activated carbon is a promising option for removing organic micropollutants ( OMPs) from wastewater treatment plant ( WWTP) effluents. The heterogeneity of activated carbons and adsorption competition between OMPs and adsorbable compounds of the effluent organic matter ( EfOM) complicate the prediction of OMP removals. Thus , reliable and simple test systems are desirable. For this study , batch experiments with powdered activated carbon ( PAC) were carried out to examine methyl orange ( MO) as a selected surrogate competitor to simulate EfOM adsorption competition. MO solutions were spiked with carbamazepine ( CBZ) as an indicator substance for well-adsorbing OMPs. On the basis of CBZ adsorption isotherms in WWTP effluents , MO concentrations for batch test solutions with identical adsorption competition toward CBZ were calculated. The calculations were performed according to an empirical model of CBZ adsorption in the presence of MO , since predictions employing the ideal adsorbed solution theory ( IAST) proved to be inaccurate. Comparative batch tests with five different PACs were conducted with WWTP effluent and respective MO batch test solutions. Except for one PAC , the achieved CBZ removals were very similar in WWTP effluent and the test solution. Additionally , a universal correlation between MO and CBZ removals was found for four PACs.
