  We hypothesized that hypertensive patients harbor a higher risk of urinary bladder ( UB) cancer. We performed a population-based cohort study on adults using a National Health Insurance Research Database ( NHIRD) dataset. Hypertension and comparison non-hypertensive ( COMP) groups comprising 39,618 patients each were propensity score-matched by age , sex , index date , and medical comorbidities. The outcome was incident UB cancer validated using procedure codes. We constructed multivariable Cox models to derive adjusted hazard ratios ( aHRs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs). Cumulative incidence was compared using a log-rank test. During a total follow-up duration of 380,525 and 372,020 person-years in the hypertension and COMP groups , 248 and 186 patients developed UB cancer , respectively , representing a 32 % increase in the risk ( aHR , 1.32; 95 % CI , 1.09-1.60). Hypertensive women harbored a significantly increased risk of UB cancer ( aHR , 1.55; 95 % CI , 1.12-2.13) compared with non-hypertensive women , whereas men with hypertension had a statistically non-significant increased risk ( aHR , 1.22; 95 % CI , 0.96-1.55). The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the increased risk was sustained throughout different follow-up durations for the entire cohort; a statistical increase in the risk was also noted among hypertensive men. This nationwide population-based propensity score-matched cohort study supports a positive association between hypertension and subsequent UB cancer development.
