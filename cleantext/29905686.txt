  Electrically discharged plasma structures , typically several centimeters in length and sub-millimeter in diameter , have been applied to guide laser pulses in laser plasma accelerators and to focus ion and relativistic electron beams in compact , radially symmetric transport configurations. Knowledge of the on-axis plasma density is critical. Traditional density interferometry has been ineffective for these laser-machined structures , while group velocity delay ( GVD) techniques involve combining two laser paths with corresponding alignment complexities and stability sensitivities. Here the GVD technique is advanced to a common-path two-color interferometer configuration performed in the spectral domain of a broad-bandwidth femtosecond laser. Multi-shot tracking of the phase is not required , and the common path assures improved stability. This in situ technique was validated on 15 mm long plasma structures , measuring electron densities of 10
