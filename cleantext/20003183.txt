  The hypothesis was that groin hernias are hereditary. This study was undertaken to establish the degree of familial clustering of groin hernias on a nationwide scale. A register-based cohort was created consisting of all children in Denmark whose parents were born in 1970 or later by the use of the Danish Civil Registration System. Within this cohort , all groin hernia operations were identified. To establish the risk estimates associated with a positive family history of groin hernia operation , information on groin hernia operations in fathers , mothers and siblings was also assessed. In the cohort of 408381 persons , a total of 4966 were operated on for groin hernia ( incidence rate 2 · 12 per 1000 person-years at risk). A person with a mother who had undergone surgery for a groin hernia had an increased risk of 2 · 89 ( 95 per cent c.i. 2 · 48 to 3 · 34) of having a groin hernia operation; a person with a father operated on for a groin hernia had an increased risk of 1 · 75 ( 1 · 58 to 1 · 94); and a person with a sibling operated on for a groin hernia had an increased risk of 2 · 54 ( 2 · 17 to 2 · 96). The strongest association was seen between mothers who had been operated on for groin hernia and their daughters ( increased risk 6 · 01 , 95 per cent c.i. 4 · 53 to 7 · 80) , compared with the risk in girls who did not have a mother who had undergone surgery for groin hernia. Groin hernias are clustered in families , with the strongest relationship seen between mothers and their daughters.
