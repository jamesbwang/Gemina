  Inertial measurement units ( IMUs) have been demonstrated to reliably measure human joint angles-- an essential quantity in the study of biomechanics. However , most previous literature proposed IMU-based joint angle measurement systems that required manual alignment or prescribed calibration motions. This paper presents a simple , physically-intuitive method for IMU-based measurement of the knee flexion/extension angle in gait without requiring alignment or discrete calibration , based on computationally-efficient and easy-to-implement Principle Component Analysis ( PCA). The method is compared against an optical motion capture knee flexion/extension angle modeled through OpenSim. The method is evaluated using both measured and simulated IMU data in an observational study (
