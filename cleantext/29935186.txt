  Recently , we reported the presence of distinct cell clusters named acinar-like cell clusters touching Langerhans islets with thin interstitial surrounding ( ATLANTIS) in human pancreas. A morphological study in humans demonstrated that ATLANTIS and islet cell clusters are found together in the microenvironment enclosed by a common basement membrane , and ATLANTIS releases vesicles containing Regenerating gene protein ( REG Iα) to islet cell clusters. We examined 1) the presence or absence of ATLANTIS in homozygous Reg I ( mouse homologue of human REG Iα) deficient ( Reg I
