  Tetraethylammonium chloride ( TEA) induces oscillatory contractions in mouse airway smooth muscle ( ASM); however , the generation and maintenance of oscillatory contractions and their role in ASM are unclear. In this study , oscillations of ASM contraction and intracellular Ca2 + were measured using force measuring and Ca2 + imaging technique , respectively. TEA , nifedipine , niflumic acid , acetylcholine chloride , lithium chloride , KB-R7943 , ouabain , 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate , thapsigargin , tetrodotoxin , and ryanodine were used to assess the mechanism of oscillatory contractions. TEA induced depolarization , resulting in activation of L-type voltage-dependent Ca2 + channels ( LVDCCs) and voltage-dependent Na + ( VNa) channels. The former mediated Ca2 + influx to trigger a contraction and the latter mediated Na + entry to enhance the contraction via activating LVDCCs. Meanwhile , increased Ca2 +- activated Cl- channels , inducing depolarization that resulted in contraction through LVDCCs. In addition , the contraction was enhanced by intracellular Ca2 + release from Ca2 + stores mediated by inositol ( 1,4,5)- trisphosphate receptors ( IP3Rs). These pathways together produce the contractile phase of the oscillatory contractions. Furthermore , the increased Ca2 + activated the Na +- Ca2 + exchanger ( NCX) , which transferred Ca2 + out of and Na + into the cells. The former induced relaxation and the latter activated Na +/ K +- ATPase that induced hypopolarization to inactivate LVDCCs causing further relaxation. This can also explain the relaxant phase of the oscillatory contractions. Moreover , the depolarization induced by VNa channels and NCX might be greater than the hypopolarization caused by Na +/ K +- ATPase alone , inducing LVDCC activation and resulting in further contraction. These data indicate that the TEA-induced oscillatory contractions were cooperatively produced by LVDCCs , VNa channels , Ca2 +- activated Cl- channels , NCX , Na +/ K + ATPase , IP3Rs-mediated Ca2 + release , and extracellular Ca2 +.
