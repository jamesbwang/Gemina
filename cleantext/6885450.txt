  Indoor radon exposure is responsible for increased incidence of lung cancer in communities. Building construction characteristics , materials , and environmental determinants are associated with increased radon concentration at specific sites. In this study , routine data related to radon measurements available from the Apulia ( Italy) Regional Environmental Protection Agency ( ARPA) were combined with building and ground characteristics data. An algorithm was created based on the experience of miners and it was able to produce estimates of lung cancer cases attributable to radon in different municipalities with the combined data. In the province of Lecce , the sites with a higher risk of lung cancer are Campi Salentina and Minervino , with 1.18 WLM ( working level months) and 1.38 WLM , respectively , corresponding to lung cancer incidence rates of 3.34 and 3.89 per 10 & times; 10 ³ inhabitants. The sites in the province of Bari with higher risks of lung cancer are Gravina di Puglia and Locorotondo , measuring 1.89 WLM and 1.22 WLM , respectively , which correspond to an incidence rate of lung cancer of 5.36 and 3.44 per 10 & times; 10 ³ inhabitants. The main determinants of radon exposure are whether the buildings were built between 1999 and 2001 , were one-room buildings with porous masonry , and were built on soil consisting of pelvis , clayey sand , gravel and conglomerates , calcarenites , and permeable lithotypes.
