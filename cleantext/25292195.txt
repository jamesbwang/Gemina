  Ong CB , Herdt TH , Fitzgerald SD. Hyperplastic goiter in two adult dairy cows. J Vet Diagn Invest 2014; 26:810-814. ( Original doi: 10.1177/ 1040638714554441). The use of mineral supplements as a top dressing and trace mineralized salt noted by the authors was based on non-documented verbal comments and not based on direct observation. Therefore , the definitive source of the excess iodine measured in the thyroid gland of the 2 cows examined was not identified.
