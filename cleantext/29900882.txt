  The development and progression of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is the major challenge in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The androgen receptor signaling pathway remains active in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Docetaxel and cabazitaxel are the first- and second-line chemotherapy , respectively , for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. These two taxanes , in general , function by ( i) inhibiting mitosis and inducing apoptosis and ( ii) preventing microtubule-dependent cargo trafficking. In prostate cancer , taxanes have been reported to inhibit the nuclear translocation and activity of the androgen receptor. However , whether this is attainable or not clinically remains controversial. In this review , we will provide a comprehensive view of the effects of taxanes on androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer.
