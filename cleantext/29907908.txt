  This article introduces a new corpus of eye movements<symptom> in silent reading-the Russian Sentence Corpus ( RSC). Russian uses the Cyrillic script , which has not yet been investigated in cross-linguistic eye movement<symptom> research. As in every language studied so far , we confirmed the expected effects of low-level parameters , such as word length , frequency , and predictability , on the eye movements<symptom> of skilled Russian readers. These findings allow us to add Slavic languages using Cyrillic script ( exemplified by Russian) to the growing number of languages with different orthographies , ranging from the Roman-based European languages to logographic Asian ones , whose basic eye movement<symptom> benchmarks conform to the universal comparative science of reading ( Share , 2008). We additionally report basic descriptive corpus statistics and three exploratory investigations of the effects of Russian morphology on the basic eye movement<symptom> measures , which illustrate the kinds of questions that researchers can answer using the RSC. The annotated corpus is freely available from its project page at the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/x5q2r/.
