  Redislocation of the native hip is rare. An anterior fulcrum between the proximal part of the femur and the pelvis must be present for a posterior dislocation to occur. The purpose of this study is to describe the cases of 9 patients with posterior redislocation or recurrent subluxation of the native hip that was treated with hip preservation surgery. We retrospectively identified the cases of 9 patients , from 2 institutions , who had undergone hip preservation surgery for the management of posterior redislocation or recurrent subluxation of the native hip after a dislocation. The mean number of dislocations prior to surgery was 3.2 ( range , 1 to 7). Pelvic radiographs were used to classify the acetabular morphology , sufficiency of acetabular containment , and structural anatomy of the proximal part of the femur. Radiographic identification of impinging structures was used to guide surgical treatment , which involved either femoral correction alone or the combination of femoral correction and an anteverting periacetabular osteotomy. At a mean follow-up of 73.8 months ( range , 10 to 192 months) , there had been no subsequent episodes of dislocation or subluxation in any of the hips treated with correction of the anatomic pivot point. An algorithmic approach is presented. In patients who have episodes of redislocation or recurrent subluxation of the native hip , the identification of anatomic abnormalities that create a fulcrum between the proximal part of the femur and the pelvis is critical for making appropriate treatment decisions.
