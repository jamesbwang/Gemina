  Eibesfeldtphora tonhascai ( Diptera: Phoridae) is a parasitoid of leaf-cutting ants and a potential biological control agent against these insect pests. This study describes the morphology of the ovary and spermatheca of E. tonhascai. The female reproductive tract of this parasitoid has a pair of meroistic polytrophic ovaries , two lateral oviducts that open into a common oviduct , an elongated accessory gland , and two spermathecae. Young oocytes are small and spherical , and their size increases as yolk is stored in the cytoplasm. This process is followed by chorion production by follicular cells. Mature oocytes are elliptical or torpedo-shaped. The reservoir wall of the spermatheca has type III glandular cells with cytoplasm rich in free ribosomes , rough endoplasmic reticulum , and secretory vesicles. The apical surface of these cells has microvilli associated with mitochondria. The reservoir lumen is lined by a cuticle and filled with spermatozoa. This is the first report of the ovary and spermatheca morphology of E. tonhascai and contributes to the comprehension of the reproductive biology of this parasitoid of leaf-cutting ants.
