  This work firstly aimed to synthesize mono- and di- sulfonic derivatives of chitosan by reductive amination reaction using respectively 2-formyl benzene sulfonic acid and 2,4 formyl benzene sulfonic acid sodium salts. The influence of the reactants molar ratio ( R) , aryl- substituted amino groups versus chitosan free amino groups , on the degree of substitution ( DS) of both sulfonated chitosans was assessed by
