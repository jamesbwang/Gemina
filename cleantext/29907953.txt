  A SCERTS model-based intervention with different durations ( 5-month vs. 10-month) was provided to 122 children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) ( age = 53.43 Â± 9.05 months) in Hong Kong. Before and after the intervention , the children were assessed with the Chinese Psychoeducational Profile-Third Edition ( CPEP-3) and the Developmental Assessment Chart ( DAC). Educators and parents expressed their views toward the intervention in focus groups. Results showed that participating children improved significantly in their social communication and emotional behavior after the intervention , as measured by DAC and CPEP-3. Likewise , educators and parents had positive views toward the intervention and noted the children 's improvement. The results suggest that a SCERTS model-based intervention can improve social communication , emotional regulation , and other skills in children with ASD.
