  A series of organometallic dendrons containing N,O-salicylaldimine entities at the focal point were synthesised by reacting the N,O-salicylaldimine-functionalised Fréchet dendrons ( G0 , G1 and G2) with a ( Rh ( μ-Cl) ( η2: η2-COD)) 2 dimer to yield the corresponding Rh ( COD) ( COD = cyclooctadiene) complexes. These Rh ( COD) complexes were exposed to an atmosphere of CO to yield a new class of rhodium carbonyl organometallic dendrons with Rh ( CO) 2 units at the focal point. All the compounds were characterised using standard spectroscopic and analytical techniques , these include nuclear magnetic resonance , infrared spectroscopy , mass spectrometry and single-crystal X-ray diffraction for compounds 1 , 4 and 7. All of the complexes were evaluated in the hydroformylation of 1-octene , with excellent conversion and chemoselectivity towards aldehydes. The G0- ( CO) 2 catalyst precursor ( 7) was active in the hydroformylation of 1-octene , styrene , 7-tetradecene , methyl oleate , triolein , d-limonene and R-citronellal. The conversion and chemoselectivity towards aldehydes for 7-tetradecene , methyl oleate , triolein and d-limonene were promising. Across a particular dendron series , an increase in chemoselectivity was observed due to the dendritic effect. Mercury drop tests were performed for the G0-analogues and these confirm that the hydroformylation can be attributed to a combination of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.
