  The treatment for aortic stenosis is evolving rapidly with new developments in transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR). While the procedure was initially performed under general anesthesia with invasive monitoring and transesophageal echocardiography , recent trends have shifted toward less invasive strategies. Transfemoral TAVRs are frequently performed under sedation; however , TAVRs using alternative access sites , such as the subclavian artery , are typically performed under general anesthesia. This case series describes 3 patients who underwent subclavian TAVR under combined pectoralis and interscalene blocks. All patients tolerated the procedure without complication , requiring no airway manipulation and minimal postoperative analgesia.
