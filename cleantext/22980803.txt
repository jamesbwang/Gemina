  Sorghum is a source of hydroxycinnamic acids ( HCA) , which have shown antioxidant , anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative capacities. However , a high proportion of them have low bioaccessibility due the complex structural disposition of the plant 's cell wall. The effects of boiling and extrusion processes on sorghum bran and their effects on the antioxidant capacity and bioaccessibility of HCA during simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion were investigated. The bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds was significantly higher in extruded sorghum bran ( 38.4 %) than that obtained by boiling ( 29.5 %). This is consistent with the increase of the antioxidant capacity after in vitro digestion. In contrast , a low bioaccessibility of pure monomeric HCA was observed when they were exposed to in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. There were significant bioaccessibility reductions of 36.8 , 19.5 , 13.5 , 62.1 % for caffeic , œÅ-coumaric , ferulic and sinapic acids , respectively , when unproccessed sorghum bran was added. Although the bioaccessibility of monomeric HCA was low , the total phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity increased during the digestion simulation due to the thermal processes of extrusion and boiling. Extrusion and boiling could be utilized to produce food based on sorghum bran with biological potential.
