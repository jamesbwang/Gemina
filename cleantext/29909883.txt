  While the lateral arm free flap has been well described , there is a relative paucity in its use compared to other free flaps and regional flaps. The lateral arm free flap is a unique soft tissue free flap that provides several reconstructive advantages in head and neck reconstruction: excellent contour and color match to facial skin , well compartmentalized fat , donor nerves for nerve grafting , and the ability to two-team harvest and close the donor site without a skin graft. A detailed anatomic and harvest technique is described , along with indications and advantages of using lateral free flap for head and neck reconstruction. A scoping literature review was also conducted to tabulate indications , overall success and complications of the flap. The lateral arm flap is a primary option for defects requiring soft tissue reconstruction in the head and neck.
