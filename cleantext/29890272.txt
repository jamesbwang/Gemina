  Despite the progress achieved in recent years , the prognosis of patients with primary brain tumors remains poor. Research efforts have therefore focused on identifying more effective and minimally invasive treatment methods. MR guided transcranial focused ultrasound ( MRgFUS) is a consolidated minimally invasive therapeutic technique , which has recently acquired a role also in the treatment of some non-oncological intracranial pathologies. In this article , we 've reviewed the latest studies to take stock of the potential that this method can offer. The objective of the research in the last decade was to be able to apply FUS also to the treatment of intracranial neoplastic diseases , using both the thermal effects ( thermal ablation) and , above all , the ability to permeabilize Blood Brain Barrier ( BBB) and modify the tumor microenvironment. This may allow the use of drugs that are currently poorly active on the CNS or active at high doses and selectively , minimizing the side effects and substantially modifying the prognosis of patients affected by these diseases. In the future , targeted drug delivery , immunotherapy and gene therapy will probably become main players in the treatment of brain neoplasms , finding a precious aid in MRgFUS. In this way , it will be possible to directly intervene on tumor cells while preserving healthy tissue at the same time.
