  Tumour metastasis is one of the most serious challenges of cancer as it is the major cause of mortality in patients with solid tumours , including osteosarcoma ( OS). In this regard , anti-metastatic genes have potential for metastasis inhibition strategies. Recent evidence showed the importance of breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 ( BRMS1) in control of OS invasiveness , but the regulation of BRMS1 in OS remains largely unknown. Here , we used bioinformatics analyses to predict BRMS1-targeting microRNAs ( miRNAs) , and the functional binding of miRNAs to BRMS1 mRNA was evaluated using a dual luciferase reporter assay. Among all BRMS1-targeting miRNAs , only miR-151b , miR-7-5p and miR-3200-5p showed significant expression in OS specimens. Specifically , we found that only miR-3200-5p significantly inhibited protein translation of BRMS1 via pairing to the 3 '- UTR of the BRMS1 mRNA. Moreover , we detected significantly lower BRMS1 and significantly higher miR-3200-5p in the OS specimens compared to the paired adjacent non-tumour bone tissues. Furthermore , BRMS1 and miR-3200-5p levels were inversely correlated to each other. Low BRMS1 was correlated with metastasis and poor patient survival. In vitro , overexpression of miR-3200-5p significantly decreased BRMS1 levels and promoted OS cell invasion and migration , while depletion of miR-3200-5p significantly increased BRMS1 levels and inhibited OS cell invasion and migration. Thus , our study revealed that miR-3200-5p may be a critical regulator of OS cell invasiveness.
