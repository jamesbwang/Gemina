  A comprehensive understanding of host-pathogen interactions requires quantitative assessment of molecular events across a wide range of spatiotemporal scales and organizational complexities. Due to recent technical developments , this is currently only achievable with microscopy. This article is providing a general perspective on the importance of microscopy in infectious<disease> disease<disease> research , with a focus on new imaging modalities that promise to have a major impact in biomedical research in the years to come. Every major technological breakthrough in light microscopy depends on , and is supported by , advancements in computing and information technologies. Bioimage acquisition and analysis based on machine learning will pave the way toward more robust , automated and objective implementation of new imaging modalities and in biomedical research in general. The combination of novel imaging technologies with machine learning and near-physiological model systems promises to accelerate discoveries and breakthroughs in our understanding of infectious<disease> diseases<disease> , from basic research all the way to clinical applications.
