  We investigated the effects of regular leucine intake and/or resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle hypertrophy and satellite cell activity after the administration of different doses of leucine. Ten-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to six groups ( n = 7 per group): a control group ( Con) , two groups receiving either 10 % ( 0.135 g/kg. wt) ( Leu10) or 50 % ( 0.675 g/kg. wt) ( Leu50) leucine supplementation , and three exercise groups receiving 0 % ( Ex) , 10 % ( Leu10Ex) , and 50 % ( Leu50Ex) leucine supplementation. The rats performed ladder climbing exercises thrice per week for 8 weeks , and received leucine supplements at the same time daily. Muscle phenotypes were assessed by immunohistochemistry. MyoD , myogenin , and IGF1 protein levels were determined by western blot. The Leu50Ex group displayed significantly higher numbers of positive embryonic myosin fibers ( 0.35 ± 0.08 , 250 %) and myonuclei ( 3.29 ± 0.3 , 118.7 %) than all other groups. And exercise training groups increased the cross-sectional area , the number of satellite cells and protein expression of MyoD , myogenin , and IGF1alpha relative to the Control group ( P < 0.05). However , Only leucine supplementation group did not increase skeletal muscle hypertrophy and satellite cell activity , regardless of the dose ( P > 0.05). Leucine intake accompanied by regular exercise training may increase satellite cell activation in skeletal muscles , and improve muscle quality more effectively than continuous leucine ingestion alone.
