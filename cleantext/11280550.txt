  Although mucosal healing ( MH) has been considered a treatment goal for patients with ulcerative colitis<pathogen> ( UC) , the risk factors predictive of relapse in patients who achieve MH are unknown. Because the platelet count has been shown to be a marker of inflammation<pathogen> in inflammatory bowel diseases<pathogen> , this study aimed to assess whether the platelet count could predict relapse in UC patients with MH. A prospective observational study was performed. UC patients with MH were consecutively enrolled in the study and monitored for at least 2 years or until relapse. The correlation between the incidence of relapse and the platelet count at the time of study enrollment was examined. In total , 43 patients were enrolled , and 14 patients ( 33 %) relapsed. The median platelet count at the time of enrollment in the patients who relapsed significantly differed from that in the patients who did not relapse ( 27.2 × 10 ⁴/ μL vs 23.8 × 10 ⁴/ μL , respectively; p = 0.016). A platelet count ＞ 25.0 × 10 ⁴/ μL was a significant risk factor for relapse based on a multivariate analysis ( hazard ratio , 4.85; 95 % confidence interval , 1.07 to 25.28) , and according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis , this cutoff could identify patients susceptible to relapse ( p = 0.041 , log-rank test). The platelet count could be used as a predictor of relapse in UC patients with MH.
