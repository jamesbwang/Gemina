  Mast cells are major effector cells for allergic responses that act by releasing inflammatory mediators , such as histamine and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Accordingly , different strategies have been pursued to develop anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory candidates by regulating the function of mast cells. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of elaeocarpusin ( EL) on mast cell-mediated allergic inflammation<symptom>. We isolated EL from
