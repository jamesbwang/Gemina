  Biopsy of the superficial temporal artery is often used in the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis , but at traditional sites there is a risk of injury to the facial nerve. Recently the Gillies incision has been suggested as an alternative means of access for the biopsy , but the anatomical basis of this has not been fully elucidated. We therefore undertook a radiographic review of 150 patients , and examining 300 vessels , to find out. Our results indicated that there is considerable variability in the position of the bifurcation of the superficial temporal artery , and so a Gillies approach may not be reliable , particularly if access to the bifurcation is required.
