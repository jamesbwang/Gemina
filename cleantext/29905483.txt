  The photophysical properties of a series of heteroatom substituted indoles are explored to identify chemical means to control their emissive activity. In particular , we consider impacts of changes in the conjugated backbone , where the C ═ N bonds of benzoxazoles are replaced by C ═ P bonds ( benzoxaphospholes). The effects of extending the π-conjugation , incorporating various secondary heteroatoms ( X-C ═ P) , and enforcing planar rigidity are also examined. Our computational analysis explains the higher fluorescence efficiency observed with extended π-conjugation and highlights the importance of maintaining molecular planarity at both ground- and emissive-state geometries.
