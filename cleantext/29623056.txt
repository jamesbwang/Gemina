  The aim of this paper is to explore how children learn to form new relationships with nature. It draws on a longitudinal case study of children participating in a stewardship project involving the conservation of salamanders during the school day in Stockholm , Sweden. The qualitative method includes two waves of data collection: when a group of 10-year-old children participated in the project ( 2015) and 2 years after they participated ( 2017). We conducted 49 interviews with children as well as using participant observations and questionnaires. We found indications that children developed sympathy for salamanders and increased concern and care for nature , and that such relationships persisted 2 years after participation. Our rich qualitative data suggest that whole situations of sufficient unpredictability triggering free exploration of the area , direct sensory contact and significant experiences of interacting with a species were important for children 's development of
