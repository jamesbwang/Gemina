  Dopant-assisted atmospheric pressure chemical ionization ( dAPCI) is a soft ionization method rarely used for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS). The current study combines GC-dAPCI with tandem mass spectrometry ( MS/MS) for analysis of a complex mixture such as lignin pyrolysis analysis. To identify the structures of volatile lignin pyrolysis products , collision-induced dissociation ( CID) MS/MS using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer ( QTOFMS) and pseudo MS/MS through in-source collision-induced dissociation ( ISCID) using a single stage TOFMS are utilized. To overcome the lack of MS/MS database , Compound Structure Identification ( CSI): FingerID is used to interpret CID spectra and predict best matched structures from PubChem library. With this approach , a total of 59 compounds were positively identified in comparison to only 22 in NIST database search of GC-EI-MS dataset. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of GC-dAPCI-MS/MS to overcome the limitations of traditional GC-EI-MS analysis when EI-MS database is not sufficient. Graphical Abstract á…Ÿ.
