  Up to now , most strategies to build efficient 800 nm-light responsive upconversion nanoparticles ( UCNPs) have included onion-layered structures , in which Nd3 + is confined within the inorganic crystal structure of at least one layer. We report here an easy room-temperature modular preparation of core-shell UCNPs consisting of NaYF4: Yb , Er ( Tm)/ NaYF4 ( UCCS) with Nd3 + anchored at the organic capping by using cucurbituril ( 7) ( CB ( 7)) as an adhesive. Strikingly , excitation at 800 nm effectively triggers the upconversion emission of UCCS@CB ( 7) @Nd nanohybrids.
