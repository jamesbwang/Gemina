  Isolated hemimegalencephaly ( iHME) is a rare form of congenital malformation of cortical development characterized by enlargement of all or part of one cerebral hemisphere. It typically presents with intractable seizures<symptom> , developmental delay , contralateral hemiparesis<symptom> , and hemianopia. We report a case of an 18-month-old girl who presented first with focal seizures<symptom> at tenth day of life , with no other physical or behavioral abnormality. Initial EEG showed excessive sharp EEG transients more over the right hemisphere; repeated EEG showed spikes , polyspikes , sharps , and slow wave discharges predominately over the right hemisphere. MRI of the brain showed asymmetric enlargement of the right cerebral hemisphere , suggestive of hemimegalencephaly. Initial treatment with antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs) was successful in controlling her seizures<symptom> , but later on the seizures<symptom> became intractable even on polytherapy of AEDs; finally , functional hemispherectomy was performed and she became seizure<symptom> free. Identification of this and similar cases of iHME can help us to better understand this disorder and eventually to provide better treatment options for it.
