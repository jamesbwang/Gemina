  Learning precision ball throwing was mostly studied to explore the early rapid improvement of accuracy , with poor attention on possible adaptive processes occurring later when the rate of improvement is reduced. Here , we tried to demonstrate that the strategy to select angle , speed and height at ball release can be managed during the learning periods following the performance stabilization. To this aim , we used a multivariate linear model with angle , speed and height as predictors of changes in accuracy. Participants performed underarm throws of a tennis ball to hit a target on the floor , 3.42 m away. Two training sessions ( S1 , S2) and one retention test were executed. Performance accuracy increased over the S1 and stabilized during the S2 , with a rate of changes along the throwing axis slower than along the orthogonal axis. However , both the axes contributed to the performance changes over the learning and consolidation time. A stable relationship between the accuracy and the release parameters was observed only during S2 , with a good fraction of the performance variance explained by the combination of speed and height. All the variations were maintained during the retention test. Overall , accuracy improvements and reduction in throwing complexity at the ball release followed separate timing over the course of learning and consolidation.
