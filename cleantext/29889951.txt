  Blood flow-restricted resistance ( BFRR) training is effective as a means to improve muscle strength and size while enduring less mechanical stress. It is generally safe but can have adverse effects. We present a case of an active duty Soldier who developed rhabdomyolysis as a result of a single course of BFRR training. He was presented to the emergency department with bilateral lower extremity pain , was admitted for electrolyte monitoring and rehydration , and had an uncomplicated hospital course and full recovery. This is an increasingly common mode of rehabilitation in the military , and practitioners and providers should be aware of it and its possible adverse effects.
