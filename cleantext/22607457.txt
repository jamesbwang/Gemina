  A simple and effective approach for vertical alignment of liquid crystals ( LCs) over a functionalized transparent flexible substrate is described. Surface characterization of this commercially available plastic substrate through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS) and attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy ( ATR-IR) indicated that cellulose acetate is main component of the transparent substrate. This substrate was chemically functionalized with a suitable LC compound. A trimethoxysilane terminated new rod-shaped mesogen is synthesized and covalently attached to the pre-treated film through silane condensation reaction. LC functionalization of the polymer film is confirmed through contact angle ( CA) , atomic force microscopy ( AFM) , XPS and ATR-IR spectroscopy studies. Versatility of the LC modified flexible substrates for the alignment of bulk LC sample at substrate-LC interface was assessed for nematic ( N) and smectic A ( SmA) phases. Remarkably , LC functionalized cellulose acetate films were found to be highly efficient in assisting a perfect homeotropic alignment of LCs ( for both , a room temperature N and a high temperature SmA phase) over the entire area of the LC sample under observation indicating their superior aligning ability in comparison to their unmodified and octadecyltrimethoxysilane ( OTS) modified counterparts. The demonstrated method of surface modification of flexible polymer film is easy , surface modified substrates are stable for several months , retained their aligning ability intact and more importantly they are reusable with maximum delivery.
