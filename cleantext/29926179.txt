  Airway protective behaviors , like cough<symptom> and swallow , deteriorate in many populations suffering from neurologic disorders. While coordination of these behaviors has been investigated in an animal model , it has not been tested in humans. We used a novel protocol , adapted from previous work in the cat , to assess cough<symptom> and swallow independently and their coordination strategies in seven healthy males ( 26 Â± 6 years). Surface electromyograms of the submental complex and external oblique complex , spirometry , and thoracic and abdominal wall kinematics , were used to evaluate the timing of swallow , cough , and breathing as well as lung volume ( LV) during these behaviors. Unlike the cat , there was significant variability in the cough-swallow phase preference; however , there was a targeted LV range in which swallow occurred. These results give insight into the differences between the cat and human models in airway protective strategies related to the coordination of cough<symptom> and swallow behaviors , allowing for better understanding of dystussia and
