  Heart rate variability ( HRV) is an indicator of dynamic adaptability of the autonomic nervous system. Few interventions target upstream , cerebral cortex components of the heart-brain system for autonomic management. We report changes in HRV and baroreflex sensitivity ( BRS) , associated with use of a noninvasive , closed-loop , allostatic , computer-guided , acoustic stimulation neurotechnology. Over 5 years , 220 subjects with heterogeneous neurological , cardiovascular , and psychophysiological conditions consecutively enrolled in a naturalistic , single-arm study exploring clinical effects associated with use of the neurotechnology. Of those , 202 completed the study protocol and 160 had recordings adequate to analyze HRV and BRS. Mean age was 44.0 ( SD 19.4) , with 130 women. Participants received a mean of 16.1 ( 5.2) sessions , over 24.2 days ( 23.3) , with 9.5 ( 3.8) actual intervention days. Sessions included real-time analysis of brain electrical activity and software algorithm-guided translation of selected frequencies into patterns of acoustic stimulation ( audible tones<symptom> of variable pitch and timing) , to facilitate auto-calibration of neural oscillations. Outcomes including 10-min supine , at-rest recordings of blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and heart rate , and inventories for insomnia ( ISI) and depression<symptom> ( CES-D or BDI-II) , were obtained at baseline and 15.3 ( 16.7) days after the last session. Compared to baseline , significant increases ( all These findings indicate that use of a noninvasive , allostatic , closed-loop neurotechnology appears to have robust potential for public health efforts to support greater flexibility in autonomic cardiovascular regulation , through self-optimization of electrical activity at the level of the brain.
