  Circadian dysfunction perturbs the female reproductive cycle. In particular , mice lacking the clock gene Bmal1 show severe infertility<symptom> , implying that BMAL1 plays roles in ovulation and luteinization. Here , we examined temporal changes in clock gene expression in the ovary and oviduct before and during gonadotropin-induced follicular growth , ovulation , and luteinization in sexually immature mice. While the oviduct did not show a drastic change in clock gene expression , Bmal1 expression in the ovary was higher than that in control mice during the period from 4 to 16 hr after human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG) administration. Bmal1 expression reached a maximum at 16 hr after hCG administration , when follicle luteinization occurred. In an interesting manner , administration of hCG to ex vivo-cultured oviduct triggered a shorter circadian period and inevitably resulted in phase advance. Together , our present data suggest that LH surge induces continuous expression of BMAL1 in the mouse ovary and modulates circadian phase in the mouse oviduct.
