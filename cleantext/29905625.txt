  Determine if a novel inpatient mortality risk assessment tool designed to be calculated in the emergency department ( ED) setting can risk stratify patient reported functional outcomes and mortality at one year. Prospective cohort SETTING:: Academic level one trauma center PATIENTS:: 685 patients > 55 years old who were orthopaedic surgery consults or trauma surgery consults in the ED between 10/1/2014 and 9/30/2015. Calculation of validated trauma triage score ( STTGMA) using each patient 's demographics , injury severity , and functional status MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS:: mortality , EQ-5D questionnaire , and percent return to baseline function since their hospitalization at one-year post hospitalization. 45 ( 6.6 %) patients died within the year following hospitalization. Of remaining 639 patients available for follow-up , 247 ( 38.7 %) were successfully contacted. There was no observed difference between patients who were successfully contacted and those who were not. The mean STTGMA score was 2.1 ± 3.6 %. Patients reported on average a 76.4 ± 27.5 % return to baseline function. When comparing patients between risk groups , there was a significant difference in EQ-5D scores and percent return to baseline. Kaplan-Meier survival curve shows that high risk patients had pronounced decreased survival within the initial days after discharge compared to other cohorts. This study demonstrates that patients identified with the STTGMA tool as having an increased risk of inpatient mortality following trauma correlate with poorer functional outcomes at one year. The STTGMA risk score is also a valuable tool to stratify risk of mortality up to one year following discharge. Level IV , Prognostic.
