  The ridgetail white prawn<disease> Exopalaemon carinicauda is one of the major commercial mariculture species in eastern China. However , only limited molecular markers are currently available due to the lack of genome information , which hinders its genetic and breeding studies. In this study , we identified new simple sequence repeats from transcriptome sequences by Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. A total of 14273 SSR loci were identified from 130,082 assembled transcripts , with 6590 pairs of PCR primers designed. A total of 12,155 sequences containing SSR were predicted; and 2764 ( 22.74 %) transcripts had significant matches to the NCBI non redundant protein ( Nr) database. 11,563 transcripts were assigned into gene ontology ( GO) categories. A set of 200 primers selected randomly were synthesized , of which 152 ( 76.0 %) were successfully amplified. Further test with 60 pairs of polymorphic SSR primers to evaluate the genetic diversity of 30 wild populations and 43 loci were polymorphic , which had a polymorphic information content between 0.204 and 0.911. The results enriched genomic resources of E. carinicauda and provided powerful information for future conservation and breeding researches.
