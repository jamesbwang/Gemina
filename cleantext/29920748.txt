  The aim of this study was to investigate the possible influence of different dietary n6/n3 ratios and DHA/EPA addition on the testis histology , antioxidative status and lipogenesis of streptozotocin-treated rats. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin ( 55 mg/kg). The rats were divided into five groups: CON ( n6/n3 ratio , 7) , CON-DM1 ( STZ; n6/n3 ratio , 7) , N3-DM1 ( STZ; n6/n3 ratio , 1) , N6-DM1 ( STZ; n6/n3 ratio , 60) and DHA-DM1 ( STZ; n6/n3 ratio , 1; added DHA/EPA). Antioxidative status was improved in the DHA-DM1 group. Seminiferous tubule diameter , testicular pathohistological scoring and total lipid content were improved in the N6-DM1 group compared to the other streptozotocin-treated groups. Streptozotocin treatment induced changes in testis fatty acid profile depending on n6/n3 ratio. The fatty acid profile of N6-DM1 group was characterised by similar or increased values for n6 fatty acids compared to the CON group , while the DHA-DM1 group had the lowest content of n6 fatty acids. The content of n3 fatty acids was increased in the N3-DM1 and DHA-DM1 groups. These results suggest that a n6/n3 ratio could significantly influence testicular antioxidative status , histology and lipogenesis and that these effects vary depending on the supplemented fatty acid.
