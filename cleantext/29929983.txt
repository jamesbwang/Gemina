  The inflammasome is a major component of the innate immune system , and its main function is to activate caspase-1 , a cysteine protease that promotes inflammation<symptom> by inducing interleukin-1β ( IL-1β) maturation and release into the extracellular milieu. To prevent uncontrolled inflammation<symptom> , this complex is highly regulated. Once it is assembled , the inflammasome is insoluble , which has long precluded the analysis of its interactions with other proteins. Here , we used the proximity-dependent biotinylation assay ( BioID) to identify proteins associated with caspase-1 during inflammasome activation. Using the BioID in a cell-free system in which the inflammasome had been activated , we found that a caspase-1-biotin ligase fusion protein selectively labeled 111 candidates , including the p62/sequestosome -1 protein ( p62). Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments , we demonstrated that p62 interacts with caspase-1. This interaction promoted caspase-1-mediated cleavage of p62 at Asp-329. Mechanistic and functional analyses revealed that caspase-1-mediated cleavage of p62 leads to loss of its interaction with the autophagosomal protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 β ( LC3B). Strikingly , the overexpression of a p62 N-terminal fragment generated upon caspase-1 cleavage decreased IL-1β release , whereas overexpression of p62 's C-terminal portion enhanced IL-1β release , by regulating pro-IL1β levels. Overall , the overexpression of both fragments together decreased IL-1β release. Taken together , our results indicate that caspase-1-mediated p62 cleavage plays a complex role in balancing caspase-1-induced
