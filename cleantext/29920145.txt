  Little is known about how decision-making conversations occur during pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU) family conferences ( FCs). Describe the decision-making process and implementation of shared decision making ( SDM) during PICU FCs. Observational study. University-based tertiary care PICU , including 31 parents and 94 PICU healthcare professionals involved in FCs. We recorded , transcribed , and analyzed 14 PICU FCs involving decision-making discussions. We used a modified grounded theory and content analysis approach to explore the use of traditionally described stages of decision making ( DM) ( information exchange , deliberation , and determining a plan). We also identified the presence or absence of predefined SDM elements. DM involved the following modified stages: information exchange; information-oriented deliberation; plan-oriented deliberation; and determining a plan. Conversations progressed through stages in a nonlinear manner. For the main decision discussed , all conferences included a presentation of the clinical issues , treatment alternatives , and uncertainty. A minority of FCs included assessing the family 's understanding ( 21 %) , assessing the family 's need for input from others ( 28 %) , exploring the family 's desired decision-making role ( 35 %) , and eliciting the family 's opinion ( 42 %). In the FCs studied , we found that DM is a nonlinear process. We also found that several SDM elements that could provide information about parents ' perspectives and needs did not always occur , identifying areas for process improvement.
