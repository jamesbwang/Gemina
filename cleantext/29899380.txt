  Ubiquilin4 ( Ubqln4) , a member of the UbL-UBA protein family , serves as an adaptor in the degradation of specific substrates via the proteasomal pathway. However , the biological function of Ubqln4 remains largely unknown , especially in cancer. Here , we reported that Ubqln4 was downregulated in gastric cancer tissues and functioned as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting gastric cancer cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of Ubqln4-induced cellular senescence and G1-S cell cycle arrest in gastric cancer cells and activated the p53/p21 axis. Moreover , Ubqln4 regulated p21 through both p53-dependent and p53-independent manners. Ubqln4 interacted with RNF114 , an E3 ubiquitin ligase of p21 , and negatively regulated its expression level , which in turn stabilized p21 by attenuating proteasomal degradation of p21. These effects of Ubqln4 were partly abrogated in gastric cancer cells upon silencing of p21. Our findings not only establish the anti-tumor potential of Ubqln4 in gastric cancer but also reveal a role for Ubqln4 in regulation of the cell cycle and cellular senescence via stabilizing p21.
