  Various blood-derived products have been proposed for the topical treatment of ocular surface diseases. The aim of the study was to compare the different content of Growth Factors ( GFs) and Interleukins ( ILs) in peripheral blood ( PB-S) and Cord Blood ( CB-S) sera. Sera were obtained from 105 healthy adult donors ( PB-S) and 107 umbilical/placental veins at the time of delivery ( CB-S). The levels of epithelial-GF ( EGF) , fibroblast-GF ( FGF) , platelet-derived-GF ( PDGF) , insulin-GF ( IGF) , transforming-GF alpha ( TGF-α ,) and beta 1-2-3 ( TGF-β1-β2-β3) , vascular endothelial-GF ( VEGF) , nerve-GF ( NGF) , Interleukin ( IL) -1 β,IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-10 , and IL-13 were assessed by Bio-Plex Protein Array System ( Bio-Rad Laboratories , CA , USA). The Mann-Whitney test for unpaired data was applied to compare GFs and ILs levels in the two sources. The associations among each GF/IL level and the obstetric data for CB-S and hematological characteristics for PB-S were also investigated. The levels of EGF , TGF-α , TGF-β2 , FGF , PDGF , VEGF , NGF , IL-1B , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-10 , and IL-13 were significantly higher in CB-S compared to PB-S. Conversely , the levels of IGF-1 , IGF-2 , and TGF-β1 were significantly higher in PB-S. The female sex and the weight of the child showed a significant association in predicting EGF and PDGF levels. A significantly different content in those GFs and ILs was demonstrated in the two blood sources. Since each GF/IL selectively regulates different cellular processes involved in corneal healing , the use of PB-S or CB-S should be chosen on the basis of the cellular mechanism to be promoted in each clinical case.
