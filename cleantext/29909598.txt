  Giant pituitary adenomas comprise about 6-10 % of all pituitary tumors. They are mostly clinically non-functioning adenomas and occur predominantly in males. The presenting symptoms are usually secondary to compression of neighboring structures , but also due to partial or total hypopituitarism. Functioning adenomas give rise to specific symptoms of hormonal hypersecretion. The use of dopamine agonists is considered a first-line treatment in patients with giant macroprolactinomas. Somatostatin analogs can also be used as primary treatment in cases of growth hormone and thyrotropin producing giant adenomas , although remission of the disease is not achieved in the vast majority of these patients. Neurosurgical treatment , either through transsphenoidal or transcranial surgery , continues to be the treatment of choice in the majority of patients with giant pituitary adenomas. The intrinsic complexity of these tumors requires the use of different therapies in a combined or sequential way. A multimodal approach and a therapeutic strategy involving a multidisciplinary team of expert professionals form the basis of the therapeutic success in these patients.
