  Recently , thousands of long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) involved in development and metastasis of malignant tumors have been identified. Long non-coding RNA ( lncRNA) breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 4 ( BCAR4) has been proved to promote proliferation and metastasis in multiple tumors. However , the function and significance of BCAR4 in cervical cancer are still unclear. In this study , we concentrated on the biological function and clinical significance of BCAR4 in cervical cancer. More specifically , BCAR4 expression was evaluated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines by qRT-PCR. Moreover , the prognostic factors were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. Additionally , functional assays were conducted and the potential mechanism was explored. Our study showed that BCAR4 expression was significantly up-regulated in cervical cancer tissue and cell lines. Moreover , patients with high BCAR4 expression showed worse survival outcomes and overexpression of BCAR4 might be an independent prognostic factor in cervical cancer. Furthermore , overexpression of BCAR4 remarkably promoted the proliferation , motility of cervical cancer cells and silencing BCAR4 significantly suppressed the proliferation , migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Additionally , overexpression of BCAR4 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) process and silencing BCAR4 suppressed EMT process in cervical cancer cells. The results indicated that BCAR4 might play a crucial role in cervical cancer progression and act as an underlying biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of cervical cancer.
