  Buccal fat pad ( BFP) is a singular structure between the facial muscles. Its removal may enhance the zygomatic prominences resulting in an inverted triangle of beauty. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of literature about BFP removal for facial aesthetic improvement. In order to answer the following research question: What are the indications , complication types and rates , surgical techniques and outcomes of the technique? The initial search in Pubmed , Scopus , and Cochrane databases recognized 220 articles. The final review included eight of them. None of the included studies were clinical trials. BPF removal was performed by intraoral incision or associated with the face lift procedure. In 71 patients submitted to the procedure and evaluated about complications , only 8.45 % presented minor complications. Parotid duct and facial nerve injuries were not found. No study evaluated facial aging and long-term effects , therefore the harmless effect of the procedure to those features is not clear. Although it is not a novel procedure , there is a lack of information about long-term outcomes. Thus , controlled clinical studies should be performed to achieve adequate clinical evidence of those aspects.
