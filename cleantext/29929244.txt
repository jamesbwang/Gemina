  This study focuses on the quantification of the impact of potentially eroded topsoil particles on the available watercourse P concentration. We used 56 topsoil samples for determining the relation existing between the molar ratio of sorption-active Fe- and Al- ( hydr) oxides to plant available P , as determined by the commonly used oxalate and Mehlich 3 extractions ( P
