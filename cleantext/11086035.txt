  Dendritic cells ( DCs) play a critical role in activation of T cell responses. Induction of type1 T helper ( Th Two cationic liposomal formulations consisting of DOTAP and DSPC/DOTAP were prepared and contained soluble DCs which were encountered to liposomes consisting of DSPC showed significantly more expression of co-stimulatory molecules in cells from both human and C57BL/6 mice but not in cells from BALB/c mice. It is concluded that cationic liposomes consisting of DSPC are an effective adjuvant for antigen delivery in case of MoDCs and BMDCs from C57BL/6 mice. Moreover , DCs from different origins act differently in uptake of liposomes.
