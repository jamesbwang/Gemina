  Constant vigilance to manage severe food allergies ( FAs) can lead to high stress. Additional stress may develop during life-course transitions , such as the transition to college. However , few studies have evaluated everyday and FA-related stress in college students with FA and their parents. This analysis examined experiences of 26 college students with FA and their parents. Students and parents completed online surveys in a mixed-methods exploratory study of everyday and FA-related stressors , potential contributing factors , and FA management. FA affected nearly all areas of students ' lives. Management required constant vigilance because of issues of trust in others. However , nearly 40 % of students did not consistently carry emergency medication to counteract reactions. Parents worried from a distance while learning to trust their child 's FA management capabilities. Additional preparation and support for college students with severe FA and their parents may help improve stress and FA management.
