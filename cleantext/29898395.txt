  Fetal globin genes are transcriptionally silenced during embryogenesis through hemoglobin switching. Strategies to derepress fetal globin expression in the adult could alleviate symptoms in sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia. We identified a zinc-finger protein , pogo transposable element with zinc-finger domain ( POGZ) , expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Targeted deletion of Pogz in adult hematopoietic cells in vivo results in persistence of embryonic β-like globin expression without affecting erythroid development. POGZ binds to the Bcl11a promoter and erythroid-specific intragenic regulatory regions. Pogz
