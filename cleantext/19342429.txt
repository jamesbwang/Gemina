  Complex<pathogen> plant-microbe interactions<pathogen> have been established throughout evolutionary time<pathogen> , many of them with beneficial effects<pathogen> on the host<pathogen> in terms<pathogen> of plant<pathogen> growth<pathogen> , nutrition<pathogen> , or health<pathogen>. Some of the corresponding modes<pathogen> of action<pathogen> involve a modulation<pathogen> of plant<pathogen> hormonal balance<pathogen> , such as the deamination<pathogen> of the ethylene<pathogen> precursor<pathogen> 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate ( ACC<pathogen>). Despite its ecological importance<pathogen> , our understanding<pathogen> of ACC<pathogen> deamination<pathogen> is impaired by a lack<pathogen> of direct molecular tools<pathogen>. Here , we developed PCR<pathogen> primers<pathogen> to quantify the ACC<pathogen> deaminase<pathogen> gene<pathogen> acdS<pathogen> and its mRNA<pathogen> in soil<pathogen> communities<pathogen> and assessed acdS<pathogen> Effective acdS<pathogen> primers<pathogen> suitable for soil<pathogen> microbial communities<pathogen> were obtained , enabling recovery<pathogen> of bona<pathogen> fida<pathogen> acdS<pathogen> genes<pathogen> and transcripts<pathogen> of diverse genetic backgrounds<pathogen>. High numbers<pathogen> of acdS<pathogen> genes<pathogen> and transcripts<pathogen> were evidenced in the rhizosphere<pathogen> of Poaceae<pathogen> , and numbers<pathogen> fluctuated according to plant<pathogen> genotype<pathogen>. Illumina sequencing<pathogen> revealed taxonomic specificities<pathogen> of acdS<pathogen> The development<pathogen> of acdS<pathogen> primers<pathogen> enabled the first direct analysis<pathogen> of ACC deaminase<pathogen> functional group<pathogen> in soil<pathogen> and showed that plant<pathogen> ability<pathogen> to interact with soil-inhabiting
