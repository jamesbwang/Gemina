  Daily torpor is used by small mammals to reduce daily energy expenditure in response to energetic challenges. Optimizing the timing of daily torpor allows mammals to maximize its energetic benefits and , accordingly , torpor typically occurs in the late night and early morning in most species. The regulatory mechanisms underlying such temporal regulation have however not been elucidated. Direct control by the circadian clock and indirect control through the timing of food intake have both been suggested as possible mechanisms. Here , feeding cycles outside of the circadian range and brain-specific mutations of circadian clock genes (
