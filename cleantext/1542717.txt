  Although the most commonly recommended treatment for melanoma and extramammary Paget 's disease ( EMPD) of the genital region is wide surgical excision of the lesion<symptom> , the procedure is highly invasive and can lead to functional and sexual problems. Alternative treatments have been used for local control when wide local excision was not feasible. Here , we describe four patients with genital malignancies who were treated with boron neutron capture therapy ( BNCT). The four patients included one patient with vulvar melanoma ( VM) and three with genital EMPD. They underwent BNCT at the Kyoto University Research Reactor between 2005 and 2014 using para-boronophenylalanine as the boron delivery agent. They were irradiated with an epithermal neutron beam between the curative tumor dose and the tolerable skin/mucosal doses. All patients showed similar tumor and normal tissue responses following BNCT and achieved complete responses within 6 months. The most severe normal tissue response was moderate skin erosion during the first 2 months , which diminished gradually thereafter. Dysuria or contact pain persisted for 2 months and resolved completely by 4 months. Treating VM and EMPD with BNCT resulted in complete local tumor control. Based on our clinical experience , we conclude that BNCT is a promising treatment for primary VM and EMPD of the genital region. Trial registration numbers UMIN000005124.
