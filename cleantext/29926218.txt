  Pectin degrading enzyme has been increasing interest in an industrial application as biocatalysts , such as juice , textile , and wine industry. Bacillus<pathogen> paralicheniformis CBS3 , isolated from popular traditional Korean food ( kimchi) , produced a novel extracellular thermostable alkaline endopolygalacturonase ( BPN3). In this study , BPN3 was purified to 22.04-fold with a recovery yield of 18.93 % and specific activity of 2216.41 U/mg by gel filtration and anion exchange column chromatography. The molecular mass of BPN3 was approximately 53 kDa as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and pectic zymography. The N-terminal sequence of BPN3 was AIPVILAX. BPN3 was stable over a broad pH range ( 8.14-11.47) , was thermally stable at 50-60 °C , and functioned optimally in pH 9.1 at 60 °C. BPN3 had K
