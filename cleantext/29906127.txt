  The reaction of 2,2 ''- ( 1,2-ethynediyl) bis-1,1 '- biphenyl under homogeneous ( heterogeneous) catalysis with Pd/C/TMS-Cl results in a dimerization and the additional formation of five- and six-membered rings. The steric demand of the acetylene prevents a ( 2 + 2 + 2) cycloaddition , but paves the way toward an alternative reaction. By the formation of an unexpected planar acephenanthrylene , the system avoids steric stain. The synthetic scope and requirements are explored , and a reaction mechanism is proposed.
