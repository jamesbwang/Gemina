  Aircraft noise causes endothelial dysfunction , oxidative stress , and inflammation<symptom>. Transportation noise increases the incidence of coronary artery disease , hypertension , and stroke. The underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Herein , we investigated effects of phagocyte-type NADPH oxidase ( Nox2) knockout and different noise protocols ( around-the-clock , sleep/awake phase noise) on vascular and cerebral complications in mice. C57BL/6j and Nox2-/- ( gp91phox-/-) mice were exposed to aircraft noise ( maximum sound<symptom> level of 85 dB ( A) , average sound pressure level of 72 dB ( A)) around-the-clock or during sleep/awake phases for 1 , 2 , and 4 days. Adverse effects of around-the-clock noise on the vasculature and brain were mostly prevented by Nox2 deficiency. Around-the-clock aircraft noise of the mice caused the most pronounced vascular effects and dysregulation of Foxo3/circadian clock as revealed by next generation sequencing ( NGS) , suggesting impaired sleep quality in exposed mice. Accordingly , sleep but not awake phase noise caused increased blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , endothelial dysfunction , increased markers of vascular/systemic oxidative stress , and inflammation<symptom>. Noise also caused cerebral oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom> , endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( e/nNOS) uncoupling , nNOS mRNA and protein down-regulation , and Nox2 activation. NGS revealed similarities in adverse gene regulation between around-the-clock and sleep phase noise. In patients with established coronary artery disease , night-time aircraft noise increased oxidative stress , and inflammation<symptom> biomarkers in serum. Aircraft noise increases vascular and cerebral oxidative stress via Nox2. Sleep deprivation and/or fragmentation caused by noise triggers vascular dysfunction. Thus , preventive measures that reduce night-time aircraft noise are warranted.
