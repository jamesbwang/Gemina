  Hypophasis is one of the most frequently observed sequelae of patients with Bell 's palsy , who have not recovered completely , creating a clinical difficulty for physicians. Acupuncture therapy has been widely used to treat Bell 's palsy as a reasonable resolution for management of symptoms such as hypophasis. The number of acupuncture points ( acu-points) is frequently selected in the approach of acupuncture therapy; however , whether these had high efficiency has not been proved. According to the literature review , Bi ` nao was useful for treating eye and eye lipid diseases , which could be proved only by some successful cases. Thus , a randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the efficiency of the acu-point Bi ` nao. Participants with hypophasis as the major symptom are selected among patients with Bell 's palsy and randomly allocated into one of the three groups at a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. All participants receive conventional acupuncture therapy; however , those assigned to the real acupuncture group will be given added acupuncture therapy on the acu-point Bi ` nao , while those assigned to the sham acupuncture group were given extra acupuncture therapy on the sham Bi ` nao as a placebo. The efficacy of the acupuncture therapy on the acu-point Bi ` nao for hypophasis will be evaluated by Eye Crack Width Measurement ( ECWM) and Eyelid Strength Assessment ( ESA) before and after therapy. This is the first study assessing the safety and efficiency of Bi ` nao in treating the hypophasis of patients with Bell 's palsy that might support the application of this acupuncture therapy. However , evaluating hypophasis is challenging , and , thus , ECWM and ESA were applied to measure the eyelid movement. Chinese Clinical Trials Registry , ChiCTR-INR-17012955.
