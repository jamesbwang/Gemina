  UL13 proteins are serine/threonine protein kinases encoded by herpes<disease> simplex<disease> virus HSV-1 and HSV-2. Although the downstream effects of the HSV protein kinases , mostly those of HSV-1 UL13 , have been reported , there is a lack of information on how these viral protein kinases are regulated in HSV-infected cells. In this study , we used a large-scale phosphoproteomic analysis of HSV-2-infected cells to identify a physiological phosphorylation site in HSV-2 UL13 ( i.e. , Ser-18) , and investigated the significance of phosphorylation of this site in HSV-2-infected cell cultures and mice. Our results were as follows. ( i) An alanine substitution at UL13 Ser-18 ( S18A) significantly reduced HSV-2 replication and cell-cell spread in U2OS cells to a level similar to the UL13 null and kinase-dead mutations. ( ii) The UL13 S18A mutation significantly impaired phosphorylation of a cellular substrate of this viral protein kinase in HSV-2-infected U2OS cells. ( iii) Following vaginal infection of mice , the UL13 S18A mutation significantly reduced mortality , HSV-2 replication in the vagina and development of vaginal disease to levels similar to the UL13 null and the kinase-dead mutations. ( iv) A phosphomimetic substitution at UL13 Ser-18 significantly restored the phenotype observed with the UL13 S18A mutation in U2OS cells and mice. Collectively , our results suggested that phosphorylation of UL13 Ser-18 regulated UL13 function in HSV-2-infected cells and this regulation was critical for the functional activity of HSV-2 UL13 in vitro and in vivo , and also for HSV-2 replication and pathogenesis.
