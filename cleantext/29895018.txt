  Metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) and hypogonadism ( HG) are frequently comorbid. In this review , we summarize interconnections between the construct of MetS and the presence of HG , as well as the effect of specific treatments for each condition on this association. Data from meta-analytic studies suggest a bidirectional pathogenic relationship. In fact , reduced T ( -2.21 ( -2.43 to -1.98) nmol/L) at baseline predicts incident MetS. On the other hand , MetS at study entry increases the risk of developing HG ( OR 2.46 ( 1.77-3.42)). The bidirectional pathogenic link between MetS and HG is further confirmed by the fact that treating MetS with insulin sensitizer is associated with an increase in T. In addition , a huge effect on increasing T is found in obese men undergoing procedures for losing weight , with more dramatic results obtained after bariatric surgery than after low calorie diet ( increase in T 8.73 ( 6.51-10.95) nmol/L and 2.87 ( 1.68-4.07) nmol/L , respectively , according to a recent meta-analysis). On the other hand , there is evidence of an improvement in several metabolic derangements characterizing MetS in subjects treated with T. However , the latter results are still not conclusive and need further evidence from randomized clinical trials.
