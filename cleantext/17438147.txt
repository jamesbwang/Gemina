  Harmonized Assessment by Randomized Multicentre Study of OrbusNEich 's Combo StEnt ( HARMONEE) ( NCT02073565) was a randomized pivotal registration trial of the Combo stent , which combined sirolimus and an abluminal bioabsorbable polymer with a novel endoluminal anti-CD34 + antibody coating designed to capture endothelial progenitor cells ( EPC) and promote percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) site healing. Clinically stabilized PCI subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive Combo or everolimus-eluting stents ( EES). Between February 2014 and June 2016 , 572 subjects with 675 coronary lesions<symptom> underwent 1-year angiography and fractional flow reserve , with optical coherence tomography ( OCT) in the first 140 patients. The primary clinical endpoint was non-inferior 1-year target vessel failure ( TVF). The primary mechanistic endpoint of EPC capture activity was superior strut coverage by OCT.. Target vessel failure occurred in 7.0 % Combo ( 20/287) vs. 4.2 % EES ( 12/285) , a 2.8 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI) -1.0 % , 6.5 %) difference , meeting the non-inferiority hypothesis ( P = 0.02). There were no cardiac deaths , with one stent thrombosis observed in the EES group. Quantitative coronary angiography late loss with Combo was equivalent to EES. Optical coherence tomography strut coverage at 1 year was superior with Combo vs. EES ( 91.3 % ( 95 % CI 88.7 % , 93.8 %) vs. 74.8 % ( 95 % CI 70.0 % , 79.6 %) , P < 0.001) , with homogeneous tissue in 81.2 % vs. 68.8 % , respectively. Combo stent demonstrated non-inferior 1-year TVF and late loss in a randomized comparison to EES , with superior strut-based tissue coverage by OCT as a surrogate of EPC capture technology activity.
