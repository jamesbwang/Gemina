  Magnetic domain walls are objects whose dynamics is inseparably connected to their structure. In this Letter , we investigate magnetic bilayers , which are engineered such that a coupled pair of domain walls , one in each layer , is stabilized by a cooperation of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and flux-closing mechanism. The dipolar field mediating the interaction between the two domain walls links not only their position but also their structure. We show that this link has a direct impact on their magnetic-field-induced dynamics. We demonstrate that in such a system the coupling leads to an increased domain wall velocity with respect to single domain walls. Since the domain wall dynamics is observed in a precessional regime , the dynamics involves the synchronization between the two walls to preserve the flux closure during motion. Properties of these coupled oscillating walls can be tuned by an additional in-plane magnetic field enabling a rich variety of states , from perfect synchronization to complete detuning.
