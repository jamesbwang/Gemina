  Fragmented QRS reflects disturbances in the myocardium predisposing the heart<symptom> to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Recent studies suggest that fragmented QRS ( fQRS) is associated with mortality in ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). However , a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature has not been done. We assessed the association between fQRS and overall mortality in STEMI patients who subsequently underwent PCI by a systematic review and meta-analysis. We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to September 2017. Studies included in our analysis were published cohort ( prospective or retrospective) and case-control studies that compared overall mortality among STEMI patient with and without fQRS who underwent PCI. Data from each study were combined using the random-effects , generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian , and Laird to calculate risk ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. Six studies from 2014 to 2017 were included in this meta-analysis involving 2,516 subjects with STEMI who underwent PCI ( 888 fQRS and 1,628 non-fQRS). Fragmented QRS was associated with overall mortality in STEMI patients who underwent PCI ( pooled risk ratio = 3.87; 95 % CI 1.96-7.66 , I Fragmented QRS was associated with increased overall mortality up to threefold. Our study suggests that fQRS could be an important tool for risk assessment in STEMI patients who underwent PCI.
