  A magnetic impurity coupled to a superconductor gives rise to a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov ( YSR) state inside the superconducting energy gap. With increasing exchange coupling the excitation energy of this state eventually crosses zero and the system switches to a YSR ground state with bound quasiparticles screening the impurity spin by Ä§/2. Here we explore indium arsenide ( InAs) nanowire double quantum dots tunnel coupled to a superconductor and demonstrate YSR screening of spin-1/ 2 and spin-1 states. Gating the double dot through nine different charge states , we show that the honeycomb pattern of zero-bias conductance peaks , archetypal of double dots coupled to normal leads , is replaced by lines of zero-energy YSR states. These enclose regions of YSR-screened dot spins displaying distinctive spectral features , and their characteristic shape and topology change markedly with tunnel coupling strengths. We find excellent agreement with a simple zero-bandwidth approximation , and with numerical renormalization group calculations for the two-orbital Anderson model.
