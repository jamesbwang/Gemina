  Chromosome congression , the process of positioning chromosomes in the midspindle , promotes the stable transmission of the genome to daughter cells during cell division. Congression is typically facilitated by DNA-associated , microtubule ( MT) plus end-directed motors<symptom> called chromokinesins. The
