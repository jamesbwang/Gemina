  Determining the functionality of CYP4G11 , the only CYP4G in the genome of the western honeybee Apis mellifera , can provide insight into its reduced CYP4 inventory. Toward this objective , CYP4G11 transcripts were quantified , and CYP4G11 was expressed as a fusion protein with housefly CPR in Sf9 cells. Transcript levels varied with age , task , and tissue type in a manner consistent with the need for cuticular hydrocarbon production to prevent desiccation or with comb wax production. Young larvae , with minimal need for desiccation protection , expressed CYP4G11 at very low levels. Higher levels were observed in nurses , and even higher levels in wax producers and foragers , the latter of which risk desiccation upon leaving the hive<disease>. Recombinant CYP4G11 readily converted octadecanal to n-heptadecane in a time-dependent manner , demonstrating its functions as an oxidative decarbonylase. CYP4G11 expression levels are high in antennae; heterologously expressed CYP4G11 converted tetradecanal to n-tridecane , demonstrating that it metabolizes shorter-chain aldehydes. Together , these findings confirm the involvement of CYP4G11 in cuticular hydrocarbon production and suggest a possible role in clearing pheromonal and phytochemical compounds from antennae. This possible dual functionality of CYP4G11 , i.e. , cuticular hydrocarbon and comb wax production and antennal odorant clearance , may explain how honeybees function with a reduced CYP4G inventory.
