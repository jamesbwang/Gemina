  The movement of the forearm follows a complex interplay of three main components: the proximal and distal radioulnar joint and the interosseous membrane. Injuries to one or even all components have a huge impact on the integrity of this system. The Essex-Lopresti lesion<symptom> presented a high challenge in clinical diagnostics as well as therapy. Reconstructions of the length and stability are essential for a satisfactory postoperative outcome. If a reconstruction of the radial head by osteosynthesis is not possible , a radial head prosthesis should be implanted in the case of longitudinal instability- avoiding overlapping and/or oversizing. The reconstruction of the interosseous membrane should be considered , as well as the assessment of the distal radioulnar joint and/or the triangular fibrocartilage complex. Various reconstruction options are available in this regard.
