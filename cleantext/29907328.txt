  Glucose regulated protein 78 kDa ( GRP78) is a recently emerged target for cancer therapy and a biomarker for cancer prognosis. Overexpression of GRP78 is observed in many types of cancers , with the cell-surface GRP78 being preferentially present in cancer cells and cancer blood vessel endothelial cells. Isthmin ( ISM) is a secreted high-affinity proapoptotic protein ligand of cell-surface GRP78 that suppresses angiogenesis and tumor growth in mice. The C-terminal AMOP ( adhesion-associated domain in MUC4 and other proteins) domain of ISM is critical in mediating its interaction with human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs). In this work , we report novel cyclic peptides harboring the RKD motif in the ISM AMOP domain that function as proapoptotic ligands of cell-surface GRP78. The most potent peptide , BC71 , binds to GRP78 and converge to tumor in mice. Intravenous administration of BC71 suppressed xenograft tumor growth in mice as a single agent , with significant reduction in tumor angiogenesis and upsurge in apoptosis. Fluorescent-labeled BC71 accumulates in tumor in mice by targeting cell-surface GRP78. We show that BC71 triggers apoptosis via cell-surface GRP78 and activates caspase-8 and p53 signaling pathways in HUVECs. Using amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry ( HDXMS) , we identified that BC71 preferentially binds to ATP-bound GRP78 via amino acid residues 244-257 of GRP78. Hence , BC71 serves as a valuable prototype for further development of peptidomimetic anticancer drugs targeting cell-surface GRP78 as well as PET imaging agents for cancer prognosis.
