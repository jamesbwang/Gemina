  The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of transforming growth factor β ( TGF-β) in the different stages of Barrett 's esophagus ( BE). Paired endoscopic esophageal biopsy samples were obtained from patients with BE prospectively. Subjects were classified into three groups: BE , BE with dysplasia , and adenocarcinoma ( AC) arising from BE. Biopsy specimens over normal esophageal epithelium and gastric cardiac epithelium of limited cases were done. Four cell lines , HETA1 ( human esophageal epithelium) , CA-A and CP-C ( non-dysplastic metaplasia) , and OE33 ( AC) were analyzed for quantitative mRNA and Western blotting of TGF-β. All 30 subjects with BE were enrolled. Expression of TGF-β mRNA in BE were significantly ( P < 0.01) lower than that in the normal esophagus and cardiac epithelium. The BE tissue showed a lower positive ratio of TGF-β immunohistochemical ( IHC) stain than the cardiac epithelium. The expression of TGF-β mRNA in the cell lines CA-A , CP-3 , OE-33 , was significantly ( P < 0.05) lower than that in the cell line HETA-1. The Western blotting result showed lower TGF-β protein expression of the cell lines CA-A , CP-3 , and OE-33. The expression of TGF-β was lower in the tissue of BE.
