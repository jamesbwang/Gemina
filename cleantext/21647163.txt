  The primary study design was a pretest and posttest study performed in a single session with subjects as their own control. We summarize three integrated and sequential studies. The objective of this study was to investigate whether commercially available cushioned shorts would add skin protection when used in adaptive sports equipment ( AE). Community in Tacoma Washington , USA. TekScan Pressure Mapping System for recording average ( AP) and peak ( PP) seating pressures. None Athletes who are static in their AE may be at greater risk of tissue breakdown than those actively playing. Cushioned shorts had highly variable effects on seated pressure in adaptive equipment. Pressure mapping is recommended prior to using any cushioning in AE by the SCI population.
