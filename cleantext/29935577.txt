  Selfhood is linked to brain processes that enable the experience of a person as a distinct entity , capable of agency. This framework naturally incorporates a continuum of both non-conscious and conscious self-related information processing , and includes a hierarchy of components , such as awareness of existence ( core self) , embodied self ( sentience) , executive self ( agency/volition) , and various other higher-order cognitive processes. Consciousness<symptom> relates to , but is not congruent , with selfhood; understanding the processes required for selfhood can explain the partial consciousness<symptom> seen in anaesthesia. Functional-brain-imaging and electroencephalographic studies in sleep and general anaesthesia have shown differential effects of anaesthetic drugs on various specific self-related functional brain networks. In particular , drug-induced selective impairment of anterior insula function suggests there might be a crucial difference between anaesthesia and natural sleep when it comes to the salience network. With increasing concentrations of anaesthetics , it is not uncommon for patients to become depersonalised ( i.e. to lose sentience and agency) , but retain many higher-order functions and a disembodied self-awareness , until quite high concentrations are reached. In this respect , general anaesthesia differs significantly from physiological sleep , where it appears that loss of agency and sentience parallels , or lags behind , the decrease in self-awareness. Interestingly , connectivity within the posterior brain regions is maintained even to quite high concentrations of anaesthetics , potentially representing a pathognomonic marker of the core self that possibly is involved in maintaining a reduced energy state of homeostasis.
