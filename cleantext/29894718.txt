  Blindsight , the residual abilities of patients with cortical blindness<symptom> to respond proficiently to stimuli they do not consciously acknowledge , offers a unique opportunity to study the functional and anatomical mechanisms sustaining visual awareness. Over decades , the phenomenon has been documented in a wide number of different patients , across independent laboratories , and for a variety of tasks and stimulus properties. Nevertheless , the functional neuroanatomy of blindsight remains elusive and alternative proposals have been put forth. To tackle this issue from a novel perspective , we performed a quantitative Activation Likelihood Estimation ( ALE) meta-analysis on the neuroimaging literature available on blindsight. Significant activity was reported in subcortical structures , such as the superior colliculus , pulvinar and amygdala , as well as in cortical extrastriate areas along the dorsal and ventral visual stream. This data-driven functional network collectively defines the extant neural fingerprint of blindsight. To further characterize the unique combination of segregation and integration in brain networks engaged in blindsight , we measured the relationship between active areas and experimental features in the original studies , their clustering and hierarchical organization. Results support a network-based organization in the functional neuroanatomy of blindsight , which likely reflects the intersection of different stimulus properties and behavioural tasks examined. We suggest that the conceptualization of blindsight as a constellation of multiple nonconscious visual abilities is better apt as a summary of present-day wisdom , thereby mirroring the variety of existing V1-independent pathway and their different functional roles.
