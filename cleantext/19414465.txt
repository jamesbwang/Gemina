  Predictions on population responses to perturbations are often derived from trait-based approaches like integral projection models ( IPMs) , but are rarely tested. IPMs are constructed from functions that describe survival , growth and reproduction in relation to the traits of individuals and their environment. Although these functions comprise biologically non-informative statistical coefficients within standard IPMs , model parameters of the recently developed dynamic energy budget IPM ( DEB-IPM) are life-history traits like `` length at maturation '' and `` maximum reproduction rate ''. Testing predictions from mechanistic IPMs against empirical observations can therefore provide functional insights into the links between individual life history , the environment and population dynamics. Here , we compared the population dynamics of the bulb mite ( Rhizoglyphus robini) predicted by a DEB-IPM with those observed in an experiment where populations experienced daily food rations that were either positively correlated over time ( red noise) , negatively ( blue noise) or uncorrelated ( white noise). We also selectively harvested large adults in half of these populations. The model failed to generate detailed predictions of population structure as juvenile numbers were overestimated; likely because juvenile-adult interference competition was underestimated. The model performed well at the population level as , for both harvested and unharvested populations , simulations matched the observed , long-term stochastic growth rate Î»
