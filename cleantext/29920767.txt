  Conventional dendritic cells ( cDCs) are continuously replenished by bone marrow-derived precursors called pre-DCs , which traffic through the blood<symptom> to peripheral tissues. Pre-DCs are a heterogeneous population that includes cDC subset-committed progenitors , namely pre-cDC1 and pre-cDC2 , which give rise to mature cDC1 and cDC2 , respectively. Regulation of pre-DC subset trafficking is thought to aid the host response to immune challenge. However , the molecular cues regulating pre-cDC1 versus pre-cDC2 trafficking toward peripheral sites during homeostasis and disease remain elusive. Here , we report that pre-cDC1 but not pre-cDC2 express the T helper type 1-associated chemokine receptor CXCR3. Moreover , we identify a cell-intrinsic role for CXCR3 in the trafficking of pre-cDC1 to melanoma tumors but not to non-inflamed organs. We also show that tumor cDC1 numbers can be increased pharmacologically by targeting dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( CD26) , a negative regulator of CXCR3 ligands. Our findings demonstrate that pre-cDC1 trafficking is regulated distinctly from pre-cDC2 , which is relevant for our understanding of the DC lineage in the context of cancer and
