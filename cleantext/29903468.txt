  Aptamers , due to the inherently high selectivity towards target analytes , are promising candidate for surface modification of the nanoparticles. Therefore , aptamer-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles ( AMNPs) was prepared and used to develop a magnetic solid-phase extraction procedure for clean-up of milk and dairy products samples before measuring the aflatoxin M1 ( AFM1) contents by the high-performance liquid chromatography. The prepared sorbent was characterized by different instrumental methods such as FT-IR , FESEM , TEM , EDX and AGFM. The AMNPs was used in extraction and pre-concentration of ultratrace amounts AFM1 from local milk samples. The amount of sorbent , elution volume , extraction time , and salt addition were optimized. Based on the results , calibration plot is linear over the 0.3 to 1 ng Â· L
