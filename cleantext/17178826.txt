  ( Purpose) This study aimed to determine the awareness amongst healthcare staff of post-stroke cognitive impairment in a university teaching hospital and supporting stroke rehabilitation unit. ( Subjects and Methods) A cross sectional study was employed to collect data from 20 healthcare staff about post-stroke cognitive impairment. This study was conducted in Ireland at two sites , the Acute Stroke unit in Cork University Hospital , and the Stroke Rehabilitation unit and Assessment and Treatment Centre in St. Finbarr 's Hospital. ( Results) Approximately 75 % of participants felt that they had knowledge about post-stroke cognitive deficits , with around 50 % of them having patients with persistent cognitive decline between 40 % and 60 %. Most participants ( 70 %) agreed that cognitive function should be routinely assessed and the majority ( 85 %) discussed the potential impact of post-stroke cognitive deficits with patients and their families. However , some participants need to be aware of post-stroke cognitive deterioration. ( Conclusion) Although there was evidence of good practice , a small number of healthcare staff felt that they did not have sufficient knowledge about post-stroke cognitive deficits. Thus , further professional education should be provided to improve the knowledge of healthcare staff about potential cognitive impairments after stroke.
