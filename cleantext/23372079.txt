  We construct and analyze piecewise approximations of functional data on arbitrary 2D bounded domains using generalized barycentric finite elements , and particularly quadratic serendipity elements for planar polygons. We compare approximation qualities ( precision/convergence) of these partition-of-unity finite elements through numerical experiments , using Wachspress coordinates , natural neighbor coordinates , Poisson coordinates , mean value coordinates , and quadratic serendipity bases over polygonal meshes on the domain. For a convex
