  This review examined validation studies of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression<symptom> Scale ( EPDS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( PHQ-9) to identify an appropriate postpartum depression<symptom> ( PPD) screening tool for American Indian and Alaska Native ( AI/AN) women in the U.S. Databases were searched using: EPDS paired with psychometric properties or validation and PHQ-9 paired with PPD and psychometric properties or validation , yielding a final sample of 58 articles. Both tools have good internal consistency , but discriminative validity for detecting PPD in women from non-Western cultures is low. Positive predictive values in these women are low and diverse ( EPDS ( n = 21) median 67 % , range 21.1-90 %; PHQ-9 ( n = 1) median 26 %). The low predictive accuracy of both tools suggests the tools may be culturally biased.
