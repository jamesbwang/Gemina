  The wavelength used during photochemical grafting of alkene onto silicon related surfaces influences molecular surface coverage. Ultraviolet light leads to apparent highly dense layers on UV absorbing materials due to the side reaction between alkenes resulting in strongly physisorbed dimers whereas higher wavelengths lead to dense and well-controlled layers.
