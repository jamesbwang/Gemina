  This paper aims to investigate the influence of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 ( Lp-PLA2) inhibitor , darapladib , on insulin resistance ( IR) in streptozotocin ( STZ)- induced diabetic pregnant rats. The rat models were divided into Control ( normal pregnancy) , STZ + saline ( STZ-induced diabetic pregnant rats) , STZ + Low-dose and STZ + High-dose darapladib ( STZ-induced diabetic pregnant rats treated with low-/ high-dose darapladib) groups. Pathological changes were observed by Hematoxylin-eosin ( HE) and Immunohistochemistry staining. Lp-PLA2 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). An automatic biochemical analyzer was used to measure the serum levels of biochemical indicators , and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR) and insulin sensitivity index ( ISI) were calculated. Western blot was applied to determine levels of inflammatory cytokines. Compared with Control group , rats in the STZ + saline group were significantly decreased in body<symptom> weight , the number of embryo implantation , the number of insulin positive cells and pancreatic islet size as well as the islet endocrine cells , and high-density lipoprotein ( HDL-C) level , but substantially increased in Lp-PLA2 , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL-C) , fatty acids ( FFA) , serum total cholesterol ( TC) , triglyceride ( TG) levels. Moreover , the increased fasting plasma glucose ( FPG) and HOMA-IR and inflammatory cytokines but decreased fasting insulin ( FINS) and ISI were also found in diabetic pregnant rats. On the contrary , rats in the darapladib-treated groups were just opposite to the STZ + saline group , and STZ + High-dose group improved better than STZ + Low-dose group. Thus , darapladib can improve lipid metabolism , and enhance insulin sensitivity of diabetic pregnant rats by regulating inflammatory cytokines.
