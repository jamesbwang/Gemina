  Essentials Patients with hemophilia A and inhibitors receiving emicizumab experience breakthrough bleeding. Safety concerns may exist when combining emicizumab with bypassing agents. Combined bypassing agent and bispecific antibody increased thrombin generation up to 17-fold. Thrombotic effects should be considered when combining emicizumab with plasma bypassing agent. Background Investigational non-factor products such as emicizumab offer a treatment option for patients with hemophilia and inhibitors. However , their mechanism of action raises questions regarding safety when they are combined with treatments for breakthrough bleeding. Objectives To evaluate in vitro thrombin generation ( TG) and clot formation for combinations of activated prothrombin complex concentrate ( aPCC) , recombinant activated factor VII ( rFVIIa) , and a sequence-identical analog of emicizumab ( SIA). Methods Therapeutic concentrations of SIA ( 20-600 nm) alone or with aPCC ( 0.05-1 U mL
