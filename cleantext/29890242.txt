  Polyamines are ubiquitous positively charged amines found in all organisms. These molecules play a crucial role in many biological functions including cell growth , gene regulation and differentiation. The three major polyamines produced in all mammalian cells are putrescine , spermidine and spermine. The intracellular levels of these polyamines depend on the interplay of the biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes of the polyamine and methionine salvage pathway , as well as the involvement of polyamine transporters. Polyamine levels are observed to be high in cancer cells , which contributes to malignant transformation , cell proliferation and poor patient prognosis. Considering the critical roles of polyamines in cancer cell proliferation , numerous anti-polyaminergic compounds have been developed as anti-tumor agents , which seek to suppress polyamine levels by specifically inhibiting polyamine biosynthesis , activating polyamine catabolism , or blocking polyamine transporters. However , in terms of the development of effective anti-cancer therapeutics targeting the polyamine system , these efforts have unfortunately resulted in little success. Recently , several studies using the iron chelators , O-trensox and ICL670A ( Deferasirox) , have demonstrated a decline in both iron and polyamine levels. Since iron levels are also high in cancer cells , and like polyamines , are required for proliferation , these latter findings suggest a biochemically integrated link between iron and polyamine metabolism.
