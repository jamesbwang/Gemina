  The purpose of this study was to identify and report demographic data of patients with severe-to-profound hearing loss , assess participation in audiological rehabilitation and analyze the benefits of various rehabilitation methods. Data on 4286 patients with severe-to-profound hearing impairments registered in the Swedish Quality Register of Otorhinolaryngology over a period from 2006-2015 were studied. Demographic data , gender differences , audiological rehabilitation and benefits of the rehabilitation were analyzed. Group rehabilitation and visits to a hearing rehabilitation educator provided the most benefits in audiological rehabilitation. Only 40.5 % of the patients received extended audiological rehabilitation , of which 54.5 % were women. A total of 9.5 % of patients participated in group rehabilitation , with 59.5 % being women. Women also visited technicians , welfare officers , hearing rehabilitation educators , psychologists and physicians and received communication rehabilitation in a group and fit with cochlea implants significantly more often than did men. The study emphasizes the importance of being given the opportunity to participate in group rehabilitation and meet a hearing rehabilitation educator to experience the benefits of hearing rehabilitation. There is a need to offer extended audiological rehabilitation , especially in terms of gender differences , to provide the same impact for women and men. Implications for Rehabilitation Significantly more women than men with severe-to-profound hearing impairment receive audiological rehabilitation. Hearing impairment appears to have a significantly more negative impact on women 's quality of life than men 's. It is important to offer extended audiological rehabilitation to all patients with severe-to-profound hearing loss to obtain an equal hearing health care regardless of gender.
