  Immunology and immunotherapy of cancer is an expanding field in oncology , with recent great achievements obtained through the new successful approaches implemented to circumvent immune evasion , which is undoubtedly considered a novel hallmark of cancer. Translational research in this topic has revealed targets that can be modulated in the clinical setting with new compounds and strategies. Like most of the tumors , breast cancer is considered a complex and heterogeneous disease in which host immune responses have been also recently demonstrated of critical relevance. T infiltrating lymphocyte<symptom> measurement is suggested as a powerful new tool necessary to predict early breast cancer evolution , especially for the her2-positive and triple-negative subtypes. Other biomarkers in tissue and peripheral blood are under intense scrutiny to ascertain their eventual role as prognostic and/or predictive factors. This background has fueled the interest in developing clinical research strategies to test activity of modern immunotherapy in breast cancer , which constitutes the main focus of this review.
