  Quercetin ( Que) has consistently been reported to be useful cytotoxic compound in vivo and in vitro , but little is known on its metabolites. Here , we examined and compared the cytotoxic effects of Que and its water-soluble metabolites , isorhamnetin ( IS) and isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide ( I3G) , in human breast-cancer MCF-7 cells to uncover their tumor-inhibitory mechanisms and structure-function relationships. The results showed that Que , IS , and I3G could dose-dependently inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells , and the cytotoxic effect was ranked as Que > IS > I3G. Furthermore , Que , IS , and I3G mediated cell-cycle arrest principally in S phase , followed by a decrease in the number of cells in G0/G1 and G2/M; moreover , 70.8 , 68.9 , and 49.8 % of MCF-7 tumor cells entered early-phase apoptosis when treated with 100 Î¼M Que , IS , and I3G for 48 h , respectively. Moreover , induction of apoptosis by Que , IS , and I3G was accompanied by the marginal generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS). Given these results , Que , IS , and I3G possess strong cytotoxic effects through an ROS-dependent apoptosis pathway in MCF-7 cells.
