  Study reported an extremely rare case of trigeminal neuralgia , vestibular paroxysmia , and hemifacial spasm successively occurring in a patient with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia ( VBD). A 66-year-old female patient presented with episodic vertigo<symptom> for 20 days before she was admitted to our hospital. Vertigo<symptom> suddenly occurred when the patient rotated her head 20 days ago , the symptoms of vertigo<symptom> were improved after continuous 1 to 3 seconds , and similar symptoms were repeated in sleep and rest , with a frequency of 30 to 40 times per day. The patient had a history of hypertension with poor blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control for more than 20 years. The final diagnosis was vertebrobasilar dolichectasia , right trigeminal neuralgia , and vestibular paroxysmia. Vitamin B1 ( 10 mg) , methylcobalamin ( 0.5 mg) , and carbamazepine ( 0.1 g) were given orally 3 times a day to relieve the symptoms. On the seventh day of drug treatment , the symptoms of paroxysmal vertigo<symptom> and trigeminal neuralgia were completely relieved , but occasional episodes occurred during the follow-up period. Five months after discharge , right hemifacial spasm appeared in the patient , which did not affect the quality of life of the patient , so the patient did not choose further treatment. Six months after discharge , the patient was lost to follow-up. Comprehensive treatment to control VBD risk factors , delay the progression of VBD , and improve clinical symptoms may have a better effect on such patients. However , further research is needed.
