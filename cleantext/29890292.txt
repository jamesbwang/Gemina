  A large number of studies have demonstrated costly punishment to unfair events across human societies. However , individuals exhibit a large heterogeneity in costly punishment decisions , whereas the neuropsychological substrates underlying the heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Here , we addressed this issue by applying a multivariate machine-learning approach to compare topological properties of resting-state brain networks as a potential neuromarker between individuals exhibiting different punishment propensities. A linear support vector machine classifier obtained an accuracy of 74.19 % employing the features derived from resting-state brain networks to distinguish two groups of individuals with different punishment tendencies. Importantly , the most discriminative features that contributed to the classification were those regions frequently implicated in costly punishment decisions , including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( dACC) and putamen ( salience network) , dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ( dmPFC) and temporoparietal junction ( mentalizing network) , and lateral prefrontal cortex ( central-executive network). These networks are previously implicated in encoding norm violation and intentions of others and integrating this information for punishment decisions. Our findings thus demonstrated that resting-state functional connectivity ( RSFC) provides a promising neuromarker of social preferences , and bolster the assertion that human costly punishment behaviors emerge from interactions among multiple neural systems.
