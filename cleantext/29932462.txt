  In metazoans , U6 small nuclear RNA ( snRNA) gene promoters utilize a proximal sequence element ( PSE) recognized by the small nuclear RNA-activating protein complex ( SNAPc). SNAPc interacts with the transcription factor TFIIIB , which consists of the subunits TBP , Brf1 ( Brf2 in vertebrates) , and Bdp1. Here , we show that , in Drosophila melanogaster , DmSNAPc directly recruits Bdp1 to the U6 promoter , and we identify an 87-residue region of Bdp1 involved in this interaction. Importantly , Bdp1 recruitment requires that DmSNAPc be bound to a U6 PSE rather than a U1 PSE. This is consistent with the concept that DmSNAPc adopts different conformations on U6 and U1 PSEs , which lead to the subsequent recruitment of distinct general transcription factors and RNA polymerases for U6 and U1 gene transcription.
