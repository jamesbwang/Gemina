  Wheat cultivars were treated by four different treatments and their flours were obtained after milling. The quality of the obtained wheat flours was determined using various quality parameters and it was observed that premilling treatments significantly affect the gluten content , wet and dry gluten yield , gluten index , and water absorption capacity of gluten , respectively. Acid-treated wheat flours of all the four wheat varieties ( C-306 , Raj-3765 , PBW-343 , and KW-11) showed lower gluten content and quality , whereas conditioning and yeast treatment improve gluten quality as well as its content. Flours obtained after premilling treatments were also utilized for noodle preparation and their sensory and quality parameters were also determined. Also , it was observed that yeast treatment and conditioning improved the noodle quality , whereas acid treatment deteriorates the noodle quality in comparison to tempering. The cultivar PBW-343 produced the best quality noodle among four wheat cultivars. In different milling treatments acid-treated flours of all cultivars showed lowest sensory and quality characteristics , while yeast treatment showed highest.
