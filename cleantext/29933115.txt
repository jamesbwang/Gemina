  In vitro experiments with cultured cells are essential for studying their growth and migration pattern and thus , for gaining a better understanding of cancer progression and its treatment. Recent progress in lens-free microscopy ( LFM) has rendered it an inexpensive tool for label-free , continuous live cell imaging , yet there is only little work on analysing such time-lapse image sequences. We propose ( 1) a cell detector for LFM images based on fully convolutional networks and residual learning , and ( 2) a probabilistic model based on moral lineage tracing that explicitly handles multiple detections and temporal successor hypotheses by clustering and tracking simultaneously. ( 3) We benchmark our method in terms of detection and tracking scores on a dataset of three annotated sequences of several hours of LFM , where we demonstrate our method to produce high quality lineages. ( 4) We evaluate its performance on a somewhat more challenging problem: estimating cell lineages from the LFM sequence as would be possible from a corresponding fluorescence microscopy sequence. We present experiments on 16 LFM sequences for which we acquired fluorescence microscopy in parallel and generated annotations from them. Finally , ( 5) we showcase our methods effectiveness for quantifying cell dynamics in an experiment with skin cancer cells.
