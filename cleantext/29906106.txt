  Using the formalism of the conditional amplitude , we study the response part of the exchange-correlation potential in the strong-coupling limit of density functional theory , analyzing its peculiar features and comparing it with the response potential averaged over the coupling constant for small atoms and for the hydrogen molecule. We also use a simple one-dimensional model of a stretched heteronuclear molecule to derive exact properties of the response potential in the strong-coupling limit. The simplicity of the model allows us to unveil relevant features also of the exact Kohn-Sham potential and its different components , namely the appearance of a second peak in the correlation kinetic potential on the side of the most electronegative atom.
