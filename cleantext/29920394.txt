  The cognitive impairments after treatment of ruptured aneurysms<disease> have often been underestimated. This study sought to assess their prevalence and analyze various associated factors. Patients who were operated on for ruptured anterior circulation aneurysms<disease> and discharged with a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 4-5 were studied at 3 months for various cognitive impairments. Continuous scales of memory ( recent , remote , verbal , visual , and overall memory) , verbal fluency ( phonemic and category fluency) , and others were studied in relation to various factors. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS version 21. A total of 87 patients were included in our study. Phonemic fluency was the most affected , noted in 66 % of patients. Although 56 % had some memory-related impairments , 13 ( 15 %) and 6 ( 7 %) had moderate and severe deficits in recent memory and 19 ( 22 %) and 12 ( 14 %) had moderate and severe deficits in remote memory , respectively. Patients operated on for anterior cerebral artery ( ACA) aneurysms<disease> had significantly greater impairments in recent ( 34 % vs. 8 %) and remote memory ( 43 % vs. 28 %) compared with the rest , both in univariate ( P = 0.01 and 0.002 , respectively) and multivariate analyses ( P = 0.01 and 0.03 , respectively). ACA-related aneurysms<disease> also had significantly greater independent impairments in phonemic fluency ( P = 0.04) , compared with others. The clinical grade had a significant independent impact only on remote memory ( P = 0.01). Cognitive impairments are frequent after treatment of ruptured anterior circulation aneurysms<disease>. Impairments in recent memory , remote memory , and phonemic fluency are significantly greater after treatment of ACA-related aneurysms<disease> , compared with others , independent of other factors.
