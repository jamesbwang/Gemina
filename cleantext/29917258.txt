  The present work evaluated preventive effect of curcumin on cisplatin-induced bladder cystopathy. Fifteen female rats were divided into ( i) Control group administered with physiological saline solution for 5 days; ( ii) Cis-P group injected with cisplatin ( 6 mg/kg); and ( iii) Cis-Cur group given cisplatin ( 6 mg/kg) with curcumin for 5 consecutive days. The function of bladder was measured by means of urodynamic analysis. Furthermore , hematoxylin-eosin staining and Masson trichrome staining were performed for morphological analysis. The cell apoptosis was evaluated through terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling ( TUNEL) assay and flow cytometry. The expression of nerve growth factor ( NGF) , NF-E2-related factor 2 , and hemeoxygenase-1 ( HO-1) levels were measured through Western blotting. Urodynamic assay and histopathological manifestations revealed that curcumin ameliorated the bladder dysfunction induced by cisplatin. The level of cisplatin-induced apoptosis in the bladder decreased following curcumin treatment. Also , the increased protein expression of NGF indicated that the curcumin could offer neuroprotection for bladder against cisplatin. Curcumin also activated NRF2 , and elevated the expression of HO-1 , but curcumin could not rescue cisplatin-induced apoptosis in the cell lines with knockdown of NRF2. Taken together , the results of this paper showed that curcumin could ameliorate cisplatin-induced cystopathy and inhibit the apoptosis of bladder cell in cisplatin-treated rats. This may be attributed to curcumin 's broad biological functions , particularly antioxidant effect , and to its ability to activate the NRF2 protein.
