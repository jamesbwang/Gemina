  Kinesin is a molecular motor that transports cargo along microtubules. The results of many in vitro experiments on kinesin-1 are described by kinetic models in which one transition corresponds to the forward motion and subsequent binding of the tethered motor<symptom> head. We argue that in a viscoelastic medium like the cytosol of a cell this step is not Markov and has to be described by a nonexponential waiting time distribution. We introduce a semi-Markov kinetic model for kinesin that takes this effect into account. We calculate , for arbitrary waiting time distributions , the moment generating function of the number of steps made , and determine from this the average velocity and the diffusion constant of the motor. We illustrate our results for the case of a waiting time distribution that is Weibull. We find that for realistic parameter values , viscoelasticity decreases the velocity and the diffusion constant , but increases the randomness ( or Fano factor).
