  Triclosan ( TCS) , the antibacterial agent commonly used in personal care products is highly toxic to aquatic lives particularly algae , zooplankton and fish. It is bio-accumulative and has endocrine disruptive properties. In this present study , we monitored the occurrence of TCS in water , sediment and fish samples collected from stretch of about 450 km of River Gomti , a major tributary of River Ganga , in India. An isocratic reversed-phase HPLC method was standardized for determination of TCS in samples. In water , TCS was detected in the range of 1.1-9.65 μg/l while in sediments the level was 5.11-50.36 μg/kg. It was also found in fishes of different species in concentrations ranging from 13 to 1040 μg/kg on wet weight basis. However , estimated daily intake of TCS through contaminated fish was much below the acceptable daily intake ( 50 μg/kg body wt/day) and thus safe from human health hazard point of view.
