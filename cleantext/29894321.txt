  To investigate the possibility of an association between serum levels of zinc ( Zn) , calcium ( Ca) , magnesium ( Mg) , iron ( Fe) , copper ( Cu) , and selenium ( Se) and advanced keratoconus ( KCN). In this study , 50 patients with advanced KCN and 50 control subjects were included. Plasma levels of Zn , Ca , Mg , Fe , Cu , and Se were compared between the groups. Mean ± SD age of the patients in the case and control groups was 29.3 ± 3.5 and 28.9 ± 5.9 years , respectively ( P = 0.669). Among serum parameters , there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in serum levels of Ca , Mg , and Fe ( P > 0.05) , whereas serum levels of Zn and Cu were significantly lower in the case group than the control group ( 65.92 ± 7.90 vs. 87.36 ± 13.64 μg/dL and 78.48 ± 11.96 vs. 116.34 ± 20.87 μg/dL , respectively ( both P < 0.001)) as well as the serum level of Se ( 79.76 ± 19.16 vs. 87.41 ± 15.91 μg/dL ( P = 0.032)). The lower serum levels of Zn , Cu , and Se in patients with advanced KCN compared with healthy controls indicate the possible role of antioxidants in the etiopathogenesis of KCN , which points to early treatment of this progressive degenerative disease with supplementation therapy , rather than keratoplasty techniques.
