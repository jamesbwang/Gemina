  Hundreds of planarian species exist worldwide , representing a rich phenotypic diversity. This chapter presents an overview of the morphology and anatomy of various taxonomic groups of planarian flatworms , focusing on features enabling recognition and identification of the animals. The most recent view on the phylogenetic relationships of the planarians is presented , together with geographic distribution patterns of major groups of triclads. The chapter concludes with a brief methodological section outlining species identification on basis of anatomical features. In conjunction with the established laboratory model species , the phenotypic diversity of planarians provides rich opportunities for comparative studies , which this chapter aims to inspire.
