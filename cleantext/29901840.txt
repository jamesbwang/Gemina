  Biotechnology provides a means for the rapid genetic improvement of plants. Although single genes have been important in engineering herbicide and pest tolerance traits in crops , future improvements of complex traits like yield and nutritional quality will likely require the introduction of multiple genes. This research reports a system ( GAANTRY; Gene Assembly in Agrobacterium<pathogen> by Nucleic acid Transfer using Recombinase technologY) for the flexible , in vivo stacking of multiple genes within an Agrobacterium<pathogen> virulence plasmid Transfer-DNA ( T-DNA). The GAANTRY system utilizes in vivo transient expression of unidirectional site-specific recombinases and an alternating selection scheme to sequentially assemble multiple genes into a single transformation construct. To demonstrate GAANTRY 's capabilities , 10 cargo sequences were sequentially stacked together to produce a 28.5-kbp T-DNA , which was used to generate hundreds of transgenic events. Approximately 90 % of the events identified using a dual antibiotic selection screen exhibited all of the introduced traits. A total of 68 % of the tested lines carried a single copy of the selection marker transgene located near the T-DNA left border , and only 8 % contained sequence from outside the T-DNA. The GAANTRY system can be modified to easily accommodate any method of DNA assembly and generate high-quality transgenic plants , making it a powerful , yet simple to use tool for plant genetic engineering.
