  Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women in Uganda , despite the potential for prevention through organised screening. Community-based self-collected human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) testing has been proposed to reduce barriers to screening. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Advances in Screening and Prevention of Reproductive Cancers ( ASPIRE) trial , conducted in Kisenyi , Uganda in April 2014 ( n = 500). The trial compared screening uptake and compliance with follow-up in two arms: ( 1) community-based ( ie , home or workplace) self-collected HPV<pathogen> testing ( facilitated by community health workers) with clinic-based visual inspection with acetic acid ( VIA) triage of HPV-positive women ( ` HPV-VIA ') and ( 2) clinic-based VIA ( ` VIA '). In both arms , VIA was performed at the local health unit by midwives with VIA-positive women receiving immediate treatment with cryotherapy. We informed a Monte Carlo simulation model of HPV<pathogen> infection and cervical cancer with screening uptake , compliance and retrospective cost data from the ASPIRE trial; additional cost , test performance and treatment effectiveness data were drawn from observational studies. The model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of each arm of ASPIRE , as well as an HPV<pathogen> screen-and-treat strategy ( ` HPV-ST ') involving community-based self-collected HPV<pathogen> testing followed by treatment for all HPV-positive women at the clinic. The primary outcomes were reductions in cervical cancer risk and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ( ICERs) , expressed in dollars per year of life saved ( YLS). HPV-ST was the most effective and cost-effective screening strategy , reducing the lifetime absolute risk of cervical cancer from 4.2 % ( range: 3.8 % -4.7 %) to 3.5 % ( range: 3.2 % -4 %) , 2.8 % ( range: 2.4 % -3.1 %) and 2.4 % ( range: 2.1 % -2.7 %) with ICERs of US$ 130 ( US$ 110-US $ 150) per YLS , US$ 240 ( US$ 210-US $ 280) per YLS , and US$ 470 ( US$ 410-US $ 550) per YLS when performed one , three and five times per lifetime , respectively. Findings were robust across sensitivity analyses , unless HPV<pathogen> costs were more than quadrupled. Community-based self-collected HPV<pathogen> testing followed by treatment for HPV-positive women has the potential to be an effective and cost-effective screening strategy.
