  Objective- to assess how rCBV maps correlate with irradiation treatment plans in patients with recurrent tumor in order to identify potential differences and optimize treatment planning. 11 patients with brain HGG have taken participation in this study. Study was conducted in Radiation Medicine Center and Scientific Research Institute of Clinical Medicine. All patients underwent DSC-MRI and routine MRI imaging prior to re-irradiation treatment planning , and underwent treatment as per routine clinical protocol. After therapy , rCBV and radiation dose maps were overlaid on conventional MR to identify correlation between them. Of 11 patients in four cases , rCBV images showed a tumor outside the irradiation field. In the case of four patients , the tumor was completely irradiated , but with a large volume of healthy brain tissue. In the remaining three patients , the volume of irradiation and rCBV maps practically coincided. DSC-MR research has demonstrated better tumor identification in patients with high grade glioma compared to conventional MRI and can be used to improve radiotherapy treatment planning.
