  Lymphoedema can result in debilitating physical and psychosocial morbidity and when combined with other chronic comorbidity , often requires holistic , specialist management that encompasses all the complex and compounding problems. Self-care is an integral component of any treatment strategy , however , the patient must be fully prepared and ongoing support should be provided. Self-care consists of managing the symptoms of lymphoedema but should include other fundamental aspects of healthy living , for example , maintaining a healthy weight and activity levels. To improve self-care , compression manufacturers have been instrumental in designing new ways of applying compression. Mobiderm Autofit armsleeves have been designed to improve the donning and wearing of compression sleeves in all patients. This product is especially useful for night-time wear and in the presence of fragile skin , or for those who only require reduced compression. The benefits of this garment are demonstrated in three case studies.
