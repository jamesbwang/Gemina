  Bacterial poly ( 3-hydroxybutyrate) ( P3HB) is a perfectly isotactic , crystalline material possessing properties suitable for substituting petroleum plastics , but high costs and low volumes of its production are impractical for commodity applications. The chemical synthesis of P3HB via ring-opening polymerization ( ROP) of racemic Î²-butyrolactone has attracted intensive efforts since the 1960s , but not yet produced P3HB with high isotacticity and molecular weight. Here , we report a route utilizing racemic cyclic diolide ( rac-DL) derived from bio-sourced succinate. With stereoselective racemic catalysts , the ROP of rac-DL under ambient conditions produces rapidly P3HB with perfect isotacticity ( ( mm) > 99 %) , high melting temperature ( T
