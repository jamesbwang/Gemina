  Despite an increasing number of studies on pharmaceuticals and personal care products ( PPCPs) , data on their concentrations in the environment are still scant. This is due to many factors , including great variability in usage and physicochemical properties of these compounds , which contribute to their widespread presence and complex behaviour , particularly in the aquatic environment. The main pathway for their discharge into the waterways is through wastewater treatment plants ( WWTPs) , which are inefficient in removing many of PPCP compounds. Therefore , aiming to contribute to a better understanding of the role that WWTPs play in the presence of PPCPs in the environment , this paper proposes a new method for estimating the expected concentrations of these compounds in WWTP influents , effluents and sludge , as well as their expected discharge and related concentrations in freshwaters. The proposed method can assist with future eco-toxicological and environmental risk assessments as well as the development of policies and regulation related to PPCP compounds.
