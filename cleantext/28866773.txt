  The purpose of this study was to develop a candidate symptom index for men with an established diagnosis of chronic orchialgia. Based on interviews with patients and providers , we developed a 70-item questionnaire that focused on seven areas of orchialgia symptoms: pain , location , urinary<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , sexual dysfunction , medical history and quality of life ( QOL) impact. The questionnaire was completed by patients at two medical centers. Cluster analysis was performed with the software package R ( 3.2.1). A total of 113 men completed the survey. Median symptom duration was 12 months ( range , 3-336 months). Outside the testicle , pain was felt in the spermatic cord ( 66 %) , groin ( 66 %) , penis ( 24 %) , suprapubic region ( 38 %) , flank ( 31 %) , thigh ( 32 %) , abdomen ( 36 %) and perineum ( 35 %). Bother scores were high only for testicle and spermatic cord pain. Urinary frequency was common ( 54 %) but not bothersome. Sexual dysfunction was common: 55 % had erectile dysfunction , 56 % had decreased libido and 39 % had painful ejaculation with high bother for all. By cluster analysis , QOL parameters clustered tightly with minimal pain level , pain at night , burning pain , distribution to spermatic cord and groin , erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. Men with chronic orchialgia have a high incidence of associated symptoms. Most bothersome symptoms with highest QOL impact include burning pain , pain at night , radiation to groin and spermatic cord , erectile dysfunction and low libido. Based on these findings , we have created a candidate orchialgia symptom index with domains of pain , sexual symptoms and QOL that will undergo prospective validation.
