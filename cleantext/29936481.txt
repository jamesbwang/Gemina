  Several risk scores can stratify patients with acute<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( AHF) at the Emergency Department ( ED). Registration of vital signs , such as blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) , heart rate ( HR) and respiratory rate ( RR) upon admission is mandatory. Nevertheless , measurement of RR remains neglected worldwide. The predictive value of RR in classifying patients with AHF was investigated by processing several vital signs recorded in the ED. HR and RR individually did not discriminate patients according to hospitalization length , Intensive Care Unit ( ICU) admittance , mechanical respiratory support or death. The derivative indices , HR: RR and Respiratory Efficacy Index ( REFI) ( = RR Ã— 100/SatO The RR and its derivative indices are easily accessible vital signs monitored at the ED which merit ` revitalization '.
