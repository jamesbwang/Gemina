  Concerns regarding the release of microplastics ( MPs) into the environment led us to explore the relationship between the different environmental factors and physicochemical properties of MPs , as well as the change of interaction between MPs and organic pollutants. In this study , the effects of environmental factors ( ageing conditions) , such as pH , temperature , ionic strength , ageing time , and humic acid ( HA) concentration , on the characteristics of MPs and their adsorption toward tetracycline ( TC) were systematically investigated. The results showed that ageing factors such as pH , ionic strength , and temperature were found to have little impact on the adsorptive capacity of MPs for TC. However , MPs aged in HA solution exhibited a significant decreased adsorptive capacity for TC. HA , which has numerous functional groups , can cover the surface of MPs and change their hydrophobicity , thereby reducing the adsorption affinity to TC. The electrostatic repulsion between adsorbed HA and TC molecules may also decrease the adsorption of TC. In addition , the competing effect of HA for adsorption sites on the surface of MPs further reduces the adsorption of TC. The data presented in this work provide useful information for understanding the transfer of antibiotics by aged MPs , which is of fundamental importance to assess the environmental impact of MPs.
