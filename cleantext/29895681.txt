  Studies in temperate fishes provide evidence that cardiac mitochondrial function and the capacity to fuel cardiac work contributes to thermal tolerance. Here we tested the hypothesis that decreased cardiac aerobic metabolic capacity contributes to the lower thermal tolerance of the haemoglobinless Antarctic icefish ,
