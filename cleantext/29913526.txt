  Ipragliflozin is a new antidiabetic agent that works through enhancing renal glucose excretion. We aim to synthesize evidence from published randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) on the safety and efficacy of ipragliflozin in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM). We searched PubMed , Scopus , Web of Science , and Cochrane Central register of clinical trials using relevant keywords. Records were screened for eligible studies and data were extracted and synthesized using Review Manager Version 5.3 for windows. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted. We included 13 RCTs ( N = 2535 patients) in the final analysis. The overall effect estimates favoured ipragliflozin 50 mg monotherapy group over placebo in terms of: HbA1c ( Standardized mean difference ( SMD) = -1.20 % , 95 % Confidence interval ( 95 % CI) =[ -1.47 , -0.93); p < 0.001) , fasting plasma glucose ( SMD = -1.30 mg/dL , 95 % CI ( -1.93 , -0.67); p < 0.001) , fasting serum insulin ( SMD = -1.64 Î¼U/mL , 95 % CI ( -2.70 , -0.59); p = 0.002) , and body<symptom> weight ( SMD = -0.85 kg , 95 % CI ( -1.19 , -0.51); p < 0.001). Similarly , better glycemic control and significant body<symptom> weight reduction compared to placebo were attained in ipragliflozin 50 mg combination with metformin , insulin with/without dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor , sulfonylurea , and pioglitazone. Ipragliflozin , either alone or in combination , exhibits acceptable safety profile. The presented meta-analysis provides class one evidence that ipragliflozin is safe and effective in the management of T2DM either as monotherapy or an add-on.
