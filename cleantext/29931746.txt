  Neurological , psychological , and cognitive disorders in chronic kidney disease may contribute to poor quality of life in these patients. The aim of this study was to assess the electroencephalographic , psychological , and cognitive changes before and after hemodialysis ( HD) compared with healthy controls ( HC). Sixteen HD patients and 15 HC were enrolled. Electroencephalogram ( EEG) , Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory ( MMPI-2) Satisfaction profile ( SAT-P) , and Neuropsychological test Global z-scores ( NPZ5) were performed before ( T0) and after ( T1) HD treatment and in HC. Renal function , inflammatory markers and mineral metabolism indexes were also evaluated. Patients did not show significant differences before and after HD in the absolute and relative power of band of EEG , except in Theta/Alpha index ( P < 0.001). At T1 , HD patients showed significant differences in Beta , Delta and Theta band , in addition to Theta/alpha index , with respect to HC. Moreover , HD patients showed significant differences in specific MMPI-2 clinical and content scales , SAT-P domains and NPZ5 tests of memory and concentration with respect to HC. We also observed significant correlations between renal function , mineral metabolism , inflammatory markers and psychocognitive alterations. In our sample EEG abnormalities tend to reduce , but not significantly , after HD treatment and differences remain present with respect to HC. In HD patients cognitive and psychological alterations were associated with reduced quality of life and correlated with mineral metabolism and inflammation<symptom>. Modification in EEG and in psychological and cognitive parameters should be assessed in a larger HD population to confirm our observation.
