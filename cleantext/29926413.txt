  Structure , conformation , and dynamics of sphingolipids can provide substantial help in better understanding sphingolipid-ligand interaction mechanisms. Both the oligosaccharide structure and the ceramide moiety of native glycosphingolipid can be established directly by NMR spectroscopic analysis without the necessity to resort to any other chemical or spectroscopic methods. NMR is a powerful technique to investigate interaction between small ligand , such as ganglioside , and membrane protein.
