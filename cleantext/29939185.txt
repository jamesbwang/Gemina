  There are many techniques that can be employed in the characterization of synthetic homopolymers , but few provide as useful of information for end group analysis as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI-TOF MS). This tutorial demonstrates methods for optimization of the sample preparation , spectral acquisition , and data analysis of synthetic polymers using MALDI-TOF MS. Critical parameters during sample preparation include the selection of the matrix , identification of an appropriate cationization salt , and tuning the relative proportions of the matrix , cation , and analyte. The acquisition parameters , such as mode ( linear or reflector) , polarization ( positive or negative) , acceleration voltage , and delay time , are also important. Given some knowledge of the chemistry involved to synthesize the polymer and optimizing both the data acquisition parameters and the sample preparation conditions , spectra should be obtained with sufficient resolution and mass accuracy to enable the unambiguous determination of the end groups of most homopolymers ( masses below 10,000) in addition to the repeat unit mass and the overall molecular weight distribution. Though demonstrated on a limited set of polymers , these general techniques are applicable to a much wider range of synthetic polymers for determining mass distributions , though end group determination is only possible for homopolymers with narrow dispersity.
