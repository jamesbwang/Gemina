  β-amyloid ( Aβ) is a hydrophobic peptide with an intrinsic tendency to self-assemble into aggregates. Among various aggregates , Aβ oligomer is widely accepted as the leading neurotoxin in the progress of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) and is considered to be the crucial event in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore , Aβ oligomer inhibitors might prevent neurodegeneration and have the potential to be developed as disease-modifying treatments of AD. However , different formation protocols of Aβ oligomer might lead to oligomers with different characteristics. Moreover , there are not many methods to effectively screen Aβ1-42 oligomer inhibitors. An A11 antibody can react with a subset of toxic Aβ1-42 oligomer with anti-parallel β-sheet structures. In this protocol , we describe how to prepare an A11-positive Aβ1-42 oligomer-rich sample from a synthetic Aβ1-42 peptide in vitro and to evaluate relative amounts of A11-positive Aβ1-42 oligomer in samples by a dot blotting analysis using A11 and Aβ1-42-specific 6E10 antibodies. Using this protocol , inhibitors of A11-positive Aβ1-42 oligomer can also be screened from semi-quantitative experimental results.
