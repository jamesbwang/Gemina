  Lignin provides structural support in perennial woody plants and is a complex phenolic polymer derived from phenylpropanoid pathway. Lignin biosynthesis is regulated by coordinated networks involving transcription factors ( TFs) , microRNAs ( miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs). However , the genetic networks underlying the lignin biosynthesis pathway for tree growth and wood properties remain unknown. Here , we used association genetics ( additive , dominant and epistasis) and expression quantitative trait nucleotide ( eQTN) mapping to decipher the genetic networks for tree growth and wood properties in 435 unrelated individuals of Populus tomentosa. We detected 124 significant associations ( P â‰¤ 6.89E-05) for 10 growth and wood property traits using 30 265 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 203 lignin biosynthetic genes , 81 TF genes , 36 miRNA genes and 71 lncRNA loci , implying their common roles in wood formation. Epistasis analysis uncovered 745 significant pairwise interactions , which helped to construct proposed genetic networks of lignin biosynthesis pathway and found that these regulators might affect phenotypes by linking two lignin biosynthetic genes. eQTNs were used to interpret how causal genes contributed to phenotypes. Lastly , we investigated the possible functions of the genes encoding 4-coumarate: CoA ligase and cinnamate-4-hydroxylase in wood traits using epistasis , eQTN mapping and enzymatic activity assays. Our study provides new insights into the lignin biosynthesis pathway in poplar and enables the novel genetic factors as biomarkers for facilitating genetic improvement of trees.
