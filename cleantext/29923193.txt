  Folate supplementation is recommended before and during early pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects , but the effect of red blood cell ( RBC) folate on large for gestational age ( LGA) is still unknown. We performed a nested case-control study including 542 LGA cases and 1,084 appropriate for gestational age ( AGA) controls to examine the association of RBC folate concentrations with risk of LGA. Then , male offspring of dams fed basic folic acid ( 2 mg/kg , control) or 10-fold folic acid ( 20 mg/kg , HFol) diet before and during pregnancy were used to explore the effect of high folate intake on birth weight and long-term effects. We observed higher RBC folate concentrations in the cases compared to controls ( p = 0.039). After adjustment for maternal age , BMI at enrollment , gestational weeks at enrollment , gestational weeks at delivery and infant gender , higher RBC folate levels were significantly associated with increased risk of LGA ( P
