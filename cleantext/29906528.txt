  Basophils express high-affinity IgE receptors ( FcεRI) , which play an essential role in allergic diseases. To design promising immunomodulatory therapies , it is important to characterize new cell surface receptors that modulate immunoglobulin ( Ig) E-mediated basophil activation threshold. To analyze the expression of CD300 receptors on human basophils and their implication in IgE-mediated basophil activation processes. Blood samples from healthy and cow 's milk allergic patients were collected through the Basque Biobank under an institutional review board-approved protocol. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs) were obtained by density centrifugation , basophils were purified using a specific isolation kit , and phenotypical and functional studies were performed by flow cytometry. We demonstrate that basophils express the activating receptor CD300c , which is specifically up-regulated in response to interleukin ( IL) -3. CD300c works as a co-stimulatory molecule during IgE-mediated basophil activation , as shown by a significant increase in degranulation and cytokine production when basophils are activated in the presence of CD300c cross-linking compared with the activation through the IgE/FcεRI axis alone. Co-ligation of FcεRI and CD300c increased intracellular calcium mobilization and phosphorylation of signalling intermediates evoked only by FcεRI ligation. We show that the natural ligands of CD300c , phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine , modulate IgE-mediated basophils activation. Furthermore , we have observed that the expression of CD300c in cow 's milk allergic children is increased compared to healthy controls , and that the intensity of expression correlates with the severity of the hypersensitivity<disease> symptoms. CD300c could be considered as a biomarker and therapeutic target in IgE-mediated allergic diseases as it seems to be involved in the modulation of IgE-mediated basophils activation.
