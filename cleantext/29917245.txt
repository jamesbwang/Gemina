  Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that the neuropeptide oxytocin may be of value in treating alcohol use disorder , by either reducing the rewarding effects of alcohol or reducing negative affect induced by alcohol withdrawal. However , the effect of a single dose of oxytocin on subjective and psychomotor responses to alcohol in social drinkers is not known. This study examined the effect of intranasal oxytocin on subjective , behavioral , and physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> to a moderate dose of alcohol ( 0.8 g/kg) in young adult social drinkers. Participants ( N = 35) completed 2 study sessions at which they consumed beverages containing alcohol ( ALC; N = 20) or placebo ( NoALC; N = 15) in combination with intranasal oxytocin ( 40 IU with a 20 IU booster) or placebo. They received oxytocin at one session and placebo at the other session ( order counterbalanced) 20 minutes before consuming beverages. Subjective mood and drug effects ratings , heart rate and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and 4 behavioral tasks ( flanker task , digit span , go/no-go , and pursuit rotor) were the primary outcome measures. ALC produced its expected subjective and behavioral effects; including feeling intoxicated and impaired performance on the digit span and go/no-go tasks. Oxytocin alone had no significant subjective or physiological effects , and it did not affect responses to alcohol on any measure. We can conclude that , under these conditions , a single dose of intranasal oxytocin does not alter the effects of acute alcohol in healthy young adult social drinkers. Further research is needed to determine whether oxytocin alters responses to alcohol under different conditions , and to determine its potential as an aid in treatment for substance use disorders.
