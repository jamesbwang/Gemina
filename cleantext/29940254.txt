  The nucleus reuniens ( Re) of the ventral midline thalamus is known to be a critical anatomical link between the hippocampus ( HPC) and the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC). Consistent with this anatomical connectivity , the Re has been shown to be crucial for HPC-mPFC oscillatory synchrony. Moreover , Re inhibition consistently results in spatial working memory ( SWM) deficits. Together , these results suggest that SWM requires HPC-mPFC synchrony via the Re. In spite of these findings , an understanding of how the Re contributes to the encoding , maintenance , and retrieval of spatial information during a SWM task is lacking. To address this issue , we trained rats to perform a SWM-dependent delayed-non-match-to-position ( DNMP) task in a T-maze. Using optogenetic inhibition of Re activity , we demonstrated that Re suppression during the sample phase , but not the delay or choice phase , significantly decreased choice accuracy. We conclude that the Re contributes to the encoding of spatial information during working memory.
