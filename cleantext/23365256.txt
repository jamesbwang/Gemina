  Mild therapeutic hypothermia<symptom> , a robust neuroprotectant , reduces neuronal apoptosis , but the precise mechanism is not well understood. Our previous study showed that a novel inhibitor of an apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 ( iASPP) might be involved in neuronal death after stroke. The aim of this study was to confirm the role of iASPP after stroke treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia<symptom>. To address this , we mimicked ischemia/reperfusion injury in vitro by using oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion ( OGD/R) in primary rat neurons. In our in vivo approach , we induced middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO) for 60 min in C57/B6 mice. From the beginning of ischemia , focal mild hypothermia<symptom> was applied for two hours. To evaluate the role of iASPP , small interfering RNA ( siRNA) was injected intracerebroventricularly. Our results showed that mild therapeutic hypothermia<symptom> increased the expression of iASPP and decreased the expression of its targets , Puma and Bax , and an apoptosis marker , cleaved caspase-3 , in primary neurons under OGD/R. Increased iASPP expression and decreased ASPP1/2 expression were observed under hypothermia<symptom> treatment in MCAO mice. iASPP siRNA ( iASPPi) or hypothermia<symptom> plus iASPPi application increased infarct volume , apoptosis and aggravated the neurological deficits in MCAO mice. Furthermore , iASPPi downregulated iASPP expression , and upregulated the expression of proapoptotic effectors , Puma , Bax and cleaved caspase-3 , in mice after stroke treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia<symptom>. In conclusion , mild therapeutic hypothermia<symptom> protects against ischemia/reperfusion brain injury in mice by upregulating iASPP and thus attenuating apoptosis. iASPP may be a potential target in the therapy of stroke.
