  Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) is a chronic condition characterized by occlusion of the upper airway during sleep resulting in daytime sleepiness. Drivers with OSA are at a two- to sevenfold increase in risk of motor vehicle crashes ( MVCs). Approximately , 13 % to 28 % of commercial motor vehicle drivers ( CMVDs) are thought to have OSA. Obstructive sleep apnea is a significant issue in the transportation industry. Currently , The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association ( FMCSA) does not mandate OSA screening. Federal regulations only specify that CMVDs be free of `` respiratory<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> '' that would impair driving. Untreated OSA is a public safety concern. The purpose of this article is to use Bardach 's eightfold policy analysis approach to examine policy options related to OSA screening in the trucking industry.
