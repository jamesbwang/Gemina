  To evaluate left atrial<symptom> ( LA) deformation parameters strain ( S)/ strain rate ( SR) and time to peak S/SR obtained by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography ( 2D-STE) in patients with hypertension for three LA mechanical phases and to compare them with the same indices in the control subjects. Fifty-five patients with hypertension ( HT) and 29 healthy controls were included in the study. All patients had normal LA poster-anterior diameter , LA and left ventricular ejection fractions ( LVEF > 50 %) in two-dimensional echocardiography ( 2-DE). The peak S/SR values ( PS/PSR) , the time to peak S/SR ( TPS/TPSR) were measured using the 12-segment model for the left atrium during contractile ( CP) reservoir ( RP) and conduit period ( COP) of the LA cycle. For two periods ( RP and COP) , all of the PS and PSR values were significantly lower in hypertensive patients with preserved LAEF and LVEF compared to those in the controls , except for the CP. Similarly , hypertensive patients had significantly higher TPS and TPSR than those in the controls for the RP and COP in the LA wall , except for the CP. LA mechanical function was impaired in hypertensive patients with preserved LA and LV ejection fraction compared to the controls. Although the PS and PSR were decreased for the RP and COP of LA mechanical phases , the TPS/TPSR were prolonged in the HT patients compared to the controls. This might be additional diagnosis criteria to detect the LA myocardial dysfunction and might be a predisposing factor for atrial arrhythmia formation in the hypertensive patients.
