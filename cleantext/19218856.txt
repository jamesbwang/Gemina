  In the prehospital situation , the diagnostic armamentarium available to the rescue physician is limited. Emergency ultrasound has proven to be a useful diagnostic tool , providing crucial information for the management of critically ill and injured patients. The proportion of performed ultrasound scans in all patients attended to by the rescue service team , the quality of the findings and the ultrasound-related changes in management approach and patient transport were evaluated. In this prospective 18-month observational study , we documented all missions performed by rescue physicians with special training in emergency ultrasound ( expert standard). These data were than analysed with regard to the ultrasound examinations. The ultrasound protocols used comprised Focussed Assessment with Sonography for Trauma ( FAST) , Prehospital Lung Ultrasound ( PLUS) and Focused Echocardiography in Emergency Life support ( FEEL). The quality of prehospital examinations was assessed by comparing the findings and diagnoses at the emergency site with those established in hospital. The changes in patient management and transport were documented using a standardized protocol. A total of 99 ( 18.1 %) emergency ultrasound examinations were performed during 546 callouts. The most common indications for prehospital emergency ultrasound were dyspnoea ( n = 38; 38.4 %) , during cardiac arrest ( n = 17/17 .2 %) , fall ( n = 12/12 .1 %) and high-speed trauma ( n = 11/11 .1 %). The combinations of ultrasound examination protocols in the trauma group ( n = 31; 31.3 %) were: 1. FAST+FEEL+PLUS ( n = 17; 54.8 %). 2. FAST+PLUS ( n = 11; 35.5 %) 3. FAST alone ( n = 3; 9.7 %). In the non-trauma group ( n = 68; 68.7 %) , the following combinations were used: 1. FEEL+PLUS ( n = 36; 52.9 %) , 2. FEEL alone ( n = 21/30 .9 %). 3. PLUS alone ( n = 6/8 .8 %) 4. FAST alone ( n = 2; 2.9 %) 5. FAST+FEEL+PLUS ( n = 2; 2.9 %). 6. FAST+FEEL ( n = 1/1 .5 %). The emergency ultrasound findings impaired left ventricular contractile function ( sensitivity 89.4 %) , right ventricular stress ( 85.7 %) , lung interstitial syndrome<disease> ( 100 %) , ruling out pneumothorax ( specificity 100 %) , ruling out intraabdominal fluid ( 97,1 %) were verified at the receiving hospital using ultrasonography , CT scan or x-rays; the prehospital diagnosis was confirmed in 90.8 % of cases , the difference between the prehospital and in-hospital findings were not significant ( p-values from p = 0.688 to p = 0,99). Ultrasound-related changes in patient management occurred in 49.5 % of patients; in 33.3 % , these were transported-related. Emergency ultrasound was as often used in the prehospital situation as it is in hospital. The ultrasound findings correlated well with in-hospital diagnostic results. Significant pathology changed patient-management , without prolonging the mission time.
