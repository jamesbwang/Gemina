  MicroRNAs have recently been proposed as non-invasive biomarkers in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( OSCC). The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of a panel of miRNAs in epithelial cells collected by oral brushing from OSCCs from regenerative areas after OSCC surgical resection and from their respective normal distant mucosa. Oral brushing specimens were collected from 24 healthy donors , 14 OSCC patients with specimens from tumour and normal distant mucosa , and from 13 patients who had OSCC resection , with samples from regenerative areas after OSCC resection and normal distant mucosa. Expression levels of eight targets ( miR-21 , miR-375 , miR-345 , miR-181b , miR-146a , miR-649 , miR-518b , and miR-191) were evaluated by real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR). A highly significant between-group difference was found for miR-21 ( F = 6.58 , Oral brushing could be proposed as a noninvasive method to study microRNA expression in oral mucosa in OSCC patients.
