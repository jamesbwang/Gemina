  The parasitic mite Varroa destructor is regarded as the most important parasite of honey bees and plays a fundamental role in the decline of bee colonies observed in the last decade in the Northern hemisphere. Parasitization has a number of detrimental effects on bees , including reduced nursing , which can have important impacts on colony balance<symptom>. In this work we investigated at the individual level the causes of this abnormal<symptom> behavior<symptom> and found that the reduced nursing activity in mite-infested workers is associated with impaired learning performance and a series of physiological traits that are typical of foragers , including reduced response to brood pheromone , limited development of hypopharyngeal glands and higher juvenile hormone titre in the haemolymph. Altogether our data confirm the premature transition to foraging already postulated based on previous genomics studies , from a physiological point of view.
