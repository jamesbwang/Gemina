  To solve the intractable problems of optimal rank truncation threshold and dominant modes selection strategy of the standard dynamic mode decomposition ( DMD) , an improved DMD algorithm is introduced in this paper. Distinct from the conventional methods , a convex optimization framework is introduced by applying a parameterized non-convex penalty function to obtain the optimal rank truncation number. This method is inspirited by the performance that it is more perfectible than other rank truncation methods in inhibiting noise disturbance. A hierarchical and multiresolution application similar to the process of wavelet packet decomposition in modes selection is presented so as to improve the algorithm 's performance. With the modes selection strategy , the frequency spectrum of the reconstruction signal is more readable and interference-free. The improved DMD algorithm successfully extracts the fault characteristics of rolling bearing fault signals when it is utilized for mechanical signal feature extraction. Results demonstrated that the proposed method has good application prospects in denoising and fault feature extraction for mechanical signals.
