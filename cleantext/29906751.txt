  Damages to the enteric nervous system caused by diabetes mellitus ( DM) are frequently attributed to oxidative and nitrosative stress. We aimed to investigate the effect of Resveratrol ( RSV) ( 10 mg/kg) on oxidative and nitrosative stress in the intestinal wall and morphoquantitative aspects of the myenteric plexus of the duodenum , jejunum<symptom> and ileum in diabetic rats. Twenty-four rats were distributed into four groups ( n = 6/group): control ( C group) , control treated with RSV ( CR group) , diabetic ( D group) , and diabetic treated with RSV ( DR group) for 120 days. Immunohistochemical staining techniques for the general neuronal population , nitrergic and calretinin neuronal subpopulations , enteric glial cells and glial fibrillary acid protein were performed in the myenteric plexus. Furthermore , parameters of oxidative and nitrosative stress were analyzed in the intestinal wall. RSV attenuated oxidative and nitrosative stress and prevented neuronal loss and hypertrophy of the HuC/D-IR , nNOS-IR and CALR-IR neuronal subpopulations in the DR group compared with the D group ( P < 0.05). In addition , RSV prevented the increase in glial fibrillary acid protein fluorescence in the DR group compared with the D ( P < 0.05). These results suggest that RSV has antioxidant and neuroprotective effects in myenteric plexus in rats with experimental DM.
