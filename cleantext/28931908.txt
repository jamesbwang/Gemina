  Nanoparticles are particles that range in size from about 1 ‚Åª 1000 nanometers in diameter , about one thousand times smaller than the average cell in a human body. Their small size , flexible fabrication , and high surface-area-to-volume ratio make them ideal systems for drug delivery. Nanoparticles can be made from a variety of materials including metals , polysaccharides , and proteins. Biological protein-based nanoparticles such as silk , keratin , collagen , elastin , corn zein , and soy protein-based nanoparticles are advantageous in having biodegradability , bioavailability , and relatively low cost. Many protein nanoparticles are easy to process and can be modified to achieve desired specifications such as size , morphology , and weight. Protein nanoparticles are used in a variety of settings and are replacing many materials that are not biocompatible and have a negative impact on the environment. Here we attempt to review the literature pertaining to protein-based nanoparticles with a focus on their application in drug delivery and biomedical fields. Additional detail on governing nanoparticle parameters , specific protein nanoparticle applications , and fabrication methods are also provided.
