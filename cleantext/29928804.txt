  We present a linear-response formulation of density cumulant theory ( DCT) that provides a balanced and accurate description of many electronic states simultaneously. In the original DCT formulation , only information about a single electronic state ( usually , the ground state) is obtained. We discuss the derivation of linear-response DCT , present its implementation for the ODC-12 method ( LR-ODC-12) , and benchmark its performance for excitation energies in small molecules ( N
