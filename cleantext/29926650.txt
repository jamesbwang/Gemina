  To investigate the effects of deficiency of CHL1 in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD). Dextran Sulfate Sodium ( DSS)- induced colitis<disease> model was used to study the effects of deficiency of CHL1 on the development of IBD. Ten CHL1 ( +/ +) mice in C57/BL6 background were randomly divided into CHL1 ( +/ +) group and DSS-induced CHL1 ( +/ +) group. Ten CHL1 (-/-) mice in C57/BL6 background were randomly divided into CHL1 (-/-) group and DSS-induced CHL1 (-/-) group. DSS-induced CHL1 ( +/ +) group and DSS-induced CHL1 (-/-) group were fed with 1.5 % DSS for 7 days , and then drinking distilled water for 2 days. CHL1 ( +/ +) group and CHL1 (-/-) group as control group were fed with distilled water for 9 days. The changes of weight , survival , fecal blood and the change of colon length in this study were observed. On the 7 The loss of CHL1 aggravates the development of IBD.
