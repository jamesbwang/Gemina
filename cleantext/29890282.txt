  Angina is an important clinical symptom indicating underlying coronary artery disease ( CAD). Its characteristics are important for the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with CAD. Currently , we aimed to investigate the association of chest<symptom> pain<symptom> characteristics with the presence of obstructive CAD in a contemporary cohort of patients undergoing coronary angiography for suspected stable CAD. Consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography for suspected stable CAD ( n = 686) in a single university hospital cardiology department were enrolled. Chest<symptom> pain<symptom> was classified as typical angina , atypical angina , nonangina chest<symptom> pain<symptom> , and lack of symptoms. The presence of significant angiographic CAD was diagnosed by standard coronary angiography. Typical angina symptoms were associated with a higher prevalence of CAD ( odds ratio ( OR) , 3.47 , p < 0.001) , whereas atypical angina symptoms were associated with a lower prevalence of CAD ( OR , 0.49 , p = 0.003) than the nonangina symptoms/or asymptomatic status. In multivariate analysis , typical angina symptoms remained an independent predictor of CAD ( OR , 2.54 , p < 0.001) , with a greater predictive accuracy than other clinical risk factors ( area under the curve ( AUC) , 0.715 , p < 0.001) and similar to the accuracy of the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( AUC , 0.712 , p < 0.001). In a multivariate model , the combination of all studied factors further improved the predictive accuracy ( AUC , 0.81 , p < 0.001). In a contemporary cohort of patients referred for coronary angiography for stable CAD , the presence of typical angina symptoms was the most important independent predictor of obstructive CAD. The association of atypical angina symptoms with low CAD prevalence compared to nonangina chest<symptom> pain<symptom> or absence of significant symptoms probably reflects different management and referral strategies in these groups of patients.
