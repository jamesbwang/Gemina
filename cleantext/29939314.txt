  Moxifloxacin is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for pediatric use. Although its use might be indicated under certain conditions , data regarding its safety and tolerability in pediatric patients are limited. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of systemic moxifloxacin therapy in children. We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients aged < 18 years who received oral or intravenous moxifloxacin at our institution between January 2011 and July 2016. Patient demographics , clinical characteristics , indication for moxifloxacin use , and adverse events ( AEs) were extracted via chart review. The attribution of AEs to moxifloxacin use was adjudicated in consultation with a pediatric infectious<disease> disease<disease> ( ID) pharmacist. We identified 221 patients who received 300 courses of moxifloxacin. The average age at moxifloxacin initiation was 10.4 years. One or more AEs occurred during 195 ( 65 %) of the courses. Of the 463 distinct AEs , 46 ( 9.9 %) were attributed to moxifloxacin. AEs attributed to moxifloxacin included corrected QT interval ( QTc) prolongation ( 18 ( 6 %) courses) , transaminase level elevation ( 7 ( 2.3 %) courses) , and increased bilirubin level ( 3 ( 1 %) courses). AEs led to moxifloxacin discontinuation in 18 ( 6 %) courses. ID consultation was associated with QTc ( P < .001) and transaminase ( P = .002) monitoring. AEs that occur during pediatric moxifloxacin therapy are relatively common but rarely serious enough to require premature discontinuation. The drug might be used safely in most children with monitoring , including evaluation for QTc prolongation , and guidance from ID specialists.
