  miRNA ( microRNA) is a kind of important endogenous non-coding small RNA , which mainly regulates the expression of target gene at the post-transcriptional level by splicing and translation inhibition and it plays an important role in the synthesis of plant secondary metabolites , especially for medicinal plants , the secondary metabolites are mostly active ingredients , which are the basis of medicinal effects. It is of great significance to study the biosynthetic pathways and complex regulatory networks of secondary metabolites of medicinal plants.This review introduces the miRNAs related to the synthesis of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants , which focuses on effects of miRNAs on biosynthesis of terpenoids , alkaloids and flavonoids , aiming to provide new ideas for biosynthesis and regulation of secondary metabolites of medicinal plants.
