  Lower extremity chronic exertional compartment syndrome<disease> ( CECS) can negatively affect exercise and activity and may require operative intervention to release the fascia. Few studies have evaluated or compared patient-reported outcomes for bilateral versus single-leg staged fasciotomy and number of compartments released. A total of 27 eligible patients who underwent a fasciotomy procedure for CECS at a single institution were identified. A retrospective review of the medical record was performed , and individuals were contacted by phone to collect patient-reported outcomes , including ability to return to desired exercise level , postoperative expectation assessment , European Quality of Life-Five Dimensions , and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure sports subscale. A total of 21 patients were available for follow-up ( average follow-up 36.9 months). The average single numeric assessment evaluation of lower-extremity function in sport was 87.5 % in those who underwent a simultaneous bilateral fasciotomy ( n = 10) , 94 % in those who had a staged unilateral fasciotomy ( n = 5) , and 74 % in those who underwent an isolated single-leg fasciotomy. In all , 91 % ( n = 10) of patients who had all 4 compartments released intra-operatively were able to return to their desired exercise level versus 66.7 % ( n = 6) of those who did not have all 4 compartments released. The patient-reported outcomes of a staged unilateral fasciotomy and simultaneous bilateral fasciotomy for CECS are similar. Those who did not have all 4 compartments released reported worse outcomes. Further research should be conducted on the short-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a bilateral versus staged fasciotomy procedure. Level IV: Case series.
