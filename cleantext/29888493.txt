  Research on the development of memory has a long history and constitutes one of the most active research areas in the field of cognitive development. In this article , we first describe major historical developments in the literature on children 's memory , focusing on systematic research that began in the late 1960s. We then examine new developments in the field , describing four important lines of inquiry: ( a) the development of implicit memory , ( b) short- and long-term memory development in infancy , ( c) longitudinal research on memory strategies and metamemory , and ( d) developmental cognitive neuroscience of memory. Finally , promising lines of future research on memory development are briefly discussed.
