  The Isonzo River has been demonstrated to be a continuing point source of mercury ( Hg) in the Gulf of Trieste although the Idrija mine was last active in 1996. The present study aims to investigate the role of the suspended particulate matter ( SPM) associated with tidal fluxes to disperse particulate Hg ( PHg) into the Grado coastal lagoon system. PHg concentrations ( avg. 3.11 ± 2.62 μg/g , d.w.) , notwithstanding the ebb or flood tides , were significantly higher than the local sediment background ( 0.13 μg/g). The relative affinity of Hg for the particulate phase in surface waters was confirmed by higher average distribution coefficient ( K
