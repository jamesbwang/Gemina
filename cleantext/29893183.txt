  This study aims to explore the perceptions and attitudes toward Public Communication of Science and Technology of the researchers of the National Council of Science and Technology ( Conacyt) , in order to provide a diagnosis about the ways the Mexican scientists are involved in public communication and to contribute to the visibility of researchers ' needs in being able to popularize science. The results show significant differences among the researchers ' opinions with respect to their perceptions about science communication , the ways they participate in PUS activities and their identified needs. In general , the researchers of Conacyt perceived public communication as very important. However , lack of time and of academic recognition stood out as determining factors in their low contribution to science popularization. We conclude that , to achieve a culture of Public Engagement in public communication of science and technology among R&D institutions , the Mexican Administration should address the above-mentioned unfavorable professional circumstances.
