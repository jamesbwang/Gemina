  To identify potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of HIV-1 progression. 19 subjects , diagnosed with HIV-1 infection in the follow-up , prospective , clinical cohort more than 6000 subjects from 2006 , were incorporated into our study. The subjects included ten non-progressors and nine rapid progressors. The plasmas of subjects before HIV-1 seroconversion and after seroconversion were collected and analyzed with nontargeted metabolomics. 20:0-Glc-Campesterol and A-norgorgostanol could significantly distinguished after HIV-1 seroconversion from before HIV-1 seroconversion. PG ( O-18:0/ 18:0) could totally distinguish the plasma of rapid progressor before seroconversion from that of nonprogressor before seroconversion. 20:0-Glc-Campesterol , A-norgorgostanol and PG ( O-18:0/ 18:0) could be potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of HIV-1 progression.
