  The placement of implants into fresh extraction sockets was introduced in 1970. This approach has been reviewed extensively during the past decade. Immediate postextraction implant placement is a well-accepted protocol. The concept of placement of dental implants soon after the removal of a tooth in smokers , however , is still a matter of controversy. ( i) To access failure rate of dental implant in smokers ( ii) To evaluate added advantage of plasma rich in growth factors ( PRGFs) in immediate placement of dental implants in smokers. The sample of 30 patients was obtained from the different Outpatient Department of Faculty of Dental Sciences; King George 's Medical University , Lucknow , who had visited for rehabilitation of missing teeth by implants between April 2013 and July 2015. They were randomly divided into two groups ( without use of PRGF and with use of PRGF) of 15 each. Pre- and postoperative assessment included a thorough history and clinical examination , regression of pain and swelling , implant stability by resonance frequency analysis ( RFA) , and implant stability according to the bone type as well as radiographic interpretation for measurement of bone loss on the mesial and distal surfaces of the implant. In this study , pain and swelling were significantly ( The immediate placement of dental implants in smokers with use of PRGF is shown to be efficient in relation to postoperative pain and swelling , stability , stability according to bone type , as well as bone loss.
