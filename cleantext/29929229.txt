  The genus Arcobacter<pathogen> comprises Campylobacter-related species , considered zoonotic emergent pathogens , the presence of which in water has been associated with fecal pollution. Discharges of fecal polluted water into the sea have been considered as one of the main reasons for the presence of Arcobacter<pathogen> in shellfish , and this may represent a risk for public health. In this study , the European Union shellfish food safety criteria based on levels of Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> were studied in relation to their capacity to predict the presence of Arcobacter<pathogen> species. In addition , the accumulation factor ( AF) that measures the concentration ratio between the microbes present in the shellfish and in the water , was also studied for both bacteria. The results show that the presence of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> correlated with the presence of the potentially pathogenic species A.<pathogen> butzleri<pathogen> and A.<pathogen> cryaerophilus<pathogen>. However , in 26.1 % of the shellfish samples ( corresponding to those taken during summer months) E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> failed to predict the presence of , for instance A.<pathogen> butzleri<pathogen> and A. skirrowii , among other species. In the rest of the samples a significant correlation between the concentration of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and Arcobacter<pathogen> spp. ( mussels and oyster; R
