  Laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors ( SBR) were used to examine the effects of adding dosage and ways of adding betaine on nitrogen and phosphorus removal from simulated pickled vegetables wastewater under two different concentrations of salt. The activated sludge was pre-acclimated in a salt environment prior to the experiment. Adding 0.5-2.0 mM betaine to the synthetic wastewater , all the levels were found to be effective at improving the ammonium nitrogen ( NH
