  Despite the broad antitumor spectrum of cisplatin , its therapeutic efficacy in cancer treatment is compromised by the development of drug resistance in tumor cells and systemic side effects. A close correlation has been drawn between cisplatin resistance in tumor cells and increased levels of intracellular thiol-containing species , especially glutathione ( GSH). The construction of a unique nanoparticle ( NP) platform composed of poly ( disulfide amide) polymers with a high disulfide density for the effective delivery of Pt ( IV) prodrugs capable of reversing cisplatin resistance through the disulfide-group-based GSH-scavenging process , as described herein , is a promising route by which to overcome limitations associated with tumor resistance. Following systematic screening , the optimized NPs ( referred to as CP5 NPs) showed a small particle size ( 76.2 nm) , high loading of Pt ( IV) prodrugs ( 15.50 % Pt) , a sharp response to GSH , the rapid release of platinum ( Pt) ions , and notable apoptosis of cisplatin-resistant A2780cis cells. CP5 NPs also exhibited long blood circulation and high tumor accumulation after intravenous injection. Moreover , in vivo efficacy and safety results showed that CP5 NPs effectively inhibited the growth of cisplatin-resistant xenograft tumors with an inhibition rate of 83.32 % while alleviating serious side effects associated with cisplatin. The GSH-scavenging nanoplatform is therefore a promising route by which to enhance the therapeutic index of Pt drugs used currently in cancer treatment.
