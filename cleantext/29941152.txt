  Glioblastoma ( GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor , with patients exhibiting poor survival ( median survival time: 15 months). Difficulties in treating GBM include not only the inability to resect the diffusively-invading tumor cells , but also therapeutic resistance. The perivascular niche ( PVN) within the GBM tumor microenvironment contributes significantly to tumor cell invasion , cancer stem cell maintenance , and has been shown to protect tumor cells from radiation and chemotherapy. In this study , we examine how the inclusion of non-tumor cells in culture with tumor cells within a hydrogel impacts the overall gene expression profile of an in vitro artificial perivascular niche ( PVN) comprised of endothelial and stromal cells directly cultured with GBM tumor cells within a methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin hydrogel. Using RNA-seq , we demonstrate that genes related to angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling are upregulated in the PVN model compared to hydrogels containing only tumor or perivascular niche cells , while downregulated genes are related to cell cycle and DNA damage repair. Signaling pathways and genes commonly implicated in GBM malignancy , such as MGMT , EGFR , PI3K-Akt signaling , and Ras/MAPK signaling are also upregulated in the PVN model. We describe the kinetics of gene expression within the PVN hydrogels over a course of 14 days , observing the patterns associated with tumor cell-mediated endothelial network co-option and regression. We finally examine the effect of temozolomide , a frontline chemotherapy used clinically against GBM , on the PVN culture. Notably , the PVN model is less responsive to TMZ compared to hydrogels containing only tumor cells. Overall , these results demonstrate that inclusion of cellular and matrix-associated elements of the PVN within an in vitro model of GBM allows for the development of gene expression patterns and therapeutic response relevant to GBM.
