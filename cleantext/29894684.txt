  Dysregulation of gene expression at RNA and protein level is a hallmark of Huntington 's disease ( HD). Altered levels of microRNAs and beta catenin in HD were studied earlier; however , any direct involvement of full length , basally-expressing mutant huntingtin ( Htt) remained to be elusive. Here we reported that the gain-of-function mutation of full-length basally-expressing Htt in HD cell Q111 ( STHdhQ111/HdhQ111) upregulated microRNA-214 and decreased beta catenin & its transcriptional activity in an aggregate-independent manner. The result was quite opposite of the function of aggregate-forming mutant Htt fragment 83Q-DsRed. Here , we also reported an elevated level of beta catenin phosphorylation in Q111 cell compared to Q7 cell ( SThdhQ7/HdhQ7). We showed that in Q111 cell ( compared to Q7) , beta catenin was more localized in the cytosol than that of the plasma membrane. This is significant as Gsk3beta phosphorylates beta catenin in the cytosol. Hence , for the first time , our study identified beta catenin localization and mutant Htt status as two key factors of beta catenin regulation in HD.
