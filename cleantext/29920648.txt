  The use of botanicals , often in the form of multi-ingredient herbal dietary supplements ( HDS) , has grown tremendously in the past three decades despite their unproven efficacy. This is paralleled by an increase in dietary supplement-related health complications , notably hepatotoxicity. This article reviews the demographics and motivations of dietary supplement ( DS) consumers and the regulatory framework for DS in the US and other developed countries. It examines in detail three groups of multi-ingredient HDS associated with hepatotoxicity: OxyElite Pro ( two formulations) , green tea extract-based DS , and `` designer anabolic steroids. '' These examples illustrate the difficulties in identifying and adjudicating causality of suspect compound ( s) of multi-ingredient HDS-associated liver injury in the clinical setting. The article outlines future directions for further study of HDS-associated hepatotoxicity as well as measures to safeguard the consumer against it.
