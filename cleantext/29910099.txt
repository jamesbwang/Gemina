  We have recently demonstrated that T cell-mediated nasal hyperresponsiveness ( NHR) is a representative pathophysiological feature of allergic rhinitis ( AR). Although several anti-allergic drugs are used for the treatment of AR , the efficacy of these drugs on T cell-mediated NHR have not been elucidated. In these studies we investigated the effects of dexamethasone ( Dex) , montelukast ( Mk) , and chlorpheniramine ( Chl) on NHR in antigen-immunized and antigen-specific Th2 cell-transferred mice. OVA-immunized BALB/c mice were treated with Dex , Mk , or Chl and challenged intranasally with OVA. We then assessed NHR , the number of inflammatory cells in the nasal lavage fluid ( NALF) , mRNA expression of Th2 cytokines in the nasal tissue , the population of CD3 Dex significantly suppressed antigen-induced NHR , inflammatory cell infiltration , and IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , and IL-13 expression in immunized mice. Chl was completely ineffective , and only IL-13 expression was suppressed by Mk. None of these drugs affected IgE and IgG production. Antigen-induced NHR and the increase in antigen-specific T cells in the NALT of Th2 cell-transferred mice were inhibited by Dex , but not by Mk or Chl. Steroids are effective for the reduction of NHR in AR by suppressing the accumulation of inflammatory cells , especially antigen-specific T cells.
