  Growing evidence indicates a potential role for miR‑490‑3p in tumorigenesis. However , its function in colorectal carcinoma ( CRC) remains undefined. In this study , miR‑490‑3p was markedly downregulated in fifty colorectal cancer tissue samples compared with the corresponding adjacent non‑cancerous specimens , by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR). The expression levels of miR‑490‑3p were closely associated with tumor differentiation and distant metastasis. In addition , both Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analyses indicated CRC patients with elevated miR‑490‑3p amounts had prolonged overall survival. Overexpression of miR‑490‑3p markedly reduced proliferation , colony formation and invasion in CRC cells by enhancing apoptosis and promoting G2/M phase arrest. Furthermore , ectopic expression of miR‑490‑3p resulted in decreased expression of RAB14 , which was directly targeted by miR‑490‑3p , as shown by the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Finally , in a nude mouse model , miR‑490‑3p overexpression significantly suppressed the growth of CRC cells. The above results indicated that miR‑490‑3p might constitute a prognostic indicator and a novel molecular target for miRNA-based CRC therapy.
