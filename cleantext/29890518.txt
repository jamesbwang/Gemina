  Tectal plate low-grade gliomas ( LGGs) most often present with increased intracranial pressure and sometimes as incidental findings from brain imaging. Prognostic factors predicting outcome are largely unknown. From 2004 until 2012 , 71 patients with tectal plate LGG from Germany and Switzerland were followed within the SIOP-LGG 2004 study. Median age at diagnosis was 9.7 ( range: 0.1-17.5) years , and median follow-up time of surviving patients was 6.3 ( interquartile range: 4.9-8.3) years. A total of 41 out of 71 patients received no tumor treatment ( 12 with and 29 without biopsy). The 10-year event-free survival ( EFS) rate ( ± standard error) for patients with an initial tumor volume of ≤ 3 cm More than half of patients were managed without tumor treatment. Favorable prognostic factors for EFS were small initial tumor volume ( ≤ 3 cm
