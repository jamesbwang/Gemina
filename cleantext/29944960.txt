  Imaging Genetics ( IG) integrates neuroimaging and genomic data from the same individual , deepening our knowledge of the biological mechanisms behind neurodevelopmental domains and neurological disorders. Although the literature on IG has exponentially grown over the past years , the majority of studies have mainly analyzed associations between candidate brain regions and individual genetic variants. However , this strategy is not designed to deal with the complexity of neurobiological mechanisms underlying behavioral and neurodevelopmental domains. Moreover , larger sample sizes and increased multidimensionality of this type of data represents a challenge for standardizing modeling procedures in IG research. This review provides a systematic update of the methods and strategies currently used in IG studies , and serves as an analytical framework for researchers working in this field. To complement the functionalities of the Neuroconductor framework , we also describe existing R packages that implement these methodologies. In addition , we present an overview of how these methodological approaches are applied in integrating neuroimaging and genetic data.
