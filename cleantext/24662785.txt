  Whey protein concentrate ( WPC) is characterized by powerful antioxidant properties , but its effect on redox homeostasis of salivary glands of aging organisms is still unknown. In this study , we are the first to evaluate the antioxidant barrier of salivary glands of 14-month Wistar rats fed WPC-80. Total antioxidant status ( TAS) , total oxidant status ( TOS) , oxidative stress index ( OSI) , activities of glutathione peroxidase ( GPx) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , catalase ( CAT) as well as concentrations of reduced glutathione ( GSH) are estimated in the submandibular and parotid glands of rats administered WPC-80 intragastrically for a period of 7 and 14 days. We demonstrate a significant increase in GSH , GPx and SOD in the salivary glands of rats fed WPC-80 for 14 days and a significant increase in TAS , GPx and SOD in the parotid glands of rats fed WPC-80 for 7 days compared to control rats. The beneficial effects of WPC-80 on salivary glands are also demonstrated by lower TOS and OSI in the parotid glands of rats fed WPC-80 compared to the submandibular glands. In summary , we demonstrate that WPC-80 improves redox homeostasis in salivary glands , particularly in the parotid glands of old rats.
