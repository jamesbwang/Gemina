  Raman spectra of the different ecotoxicants such as perfluorooctane sulfonate acid , organotin compounds of different families tributyl- , and triphenyl- , as well as chemically close compounds belonging to the same family- such as mono- , di- , and tributyl organotin compounds were analyzed. The comprehensive Raman spectra analysis allowed suggesting the identification scheme for clear recognition of the toxins family and the following intra-group specification. Possibility of unambiguous toxins detection and identification was demonstrated also for complex mixtures of various toxins on a base of control of characteristic peak groups , which can be considered as Raman fingerprints of the listed environmentally hazardous substances.
