  Stroke is devastating and a major cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. The innate immune response plays an important role in various brain injuries , including stroke , and targeting it for therapeutic interventions would likely prove beneficial. The panoply of inflammatory cells , which induce various cellular , hormonal , and biochemical alterations , mediates the rapid progression of injury in stroke. The inflammasome , a multiprotein oligomer and a key component of specific innate immune responses , contributes toward the worsening of stroke outcomes by activating inflammatory cytokines. Acidotoxicity , mediated by acid-sensing ion channels ( ASICs) , also contributes toward exacerbating the condition. A role for ASICs in stroke , through the activation of the inflammasome , is emerging , which opens new avenues for understanding and intervening in stroke. In this review , we describe the various types of inflammasomes and their mechanisms of activation in stroke. Furthermore , therapeutic approaches targeting the inflammasome and that may be helpful in improving stroke outcome are discussed.
