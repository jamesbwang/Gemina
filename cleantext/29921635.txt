  The phrase ` termination of pregnancy ' has recently been adopted by a number of British medical institutions as a preferred descriptor of induced abortion<disease> How it is used by abortion<disease> care providers is unclear , although the ongoing stigmatisation of abortion<disease> may play a role. A mixed methods study of the views of abortion<disease> care providers in Scotland , UK. Self-administered anonymous questionnaires were distributed to abortion<disease> care providers at a national conference ( Scottish Abortion<disease> Care Providers). The main outcomes measured were the proportion of respondents reporting that they found the terms ` abortion<disease> ' and ` termination of pregnancy ' to be distressing , and their preferred terminology for use in consultations with women. In-depth interviews were conducted with 19 providers from a single clinic in Scotland to contextualise use of the terminology. The questionnaire was completed by 90/118 delegates ( 76 %). More respondents indicated they found the term ` abortion<disease> ' distressing ( 28 %) , compared with those who found ` termination of pregnancy ' distressing ( 6 %; P < 0.0001). Interview participants reported that ` termination of pregnancy ' was the default phrase used in consultations. Some respondents stated that they occasionally purposely used ` abortion<disease> ' in consultations to emphasise the seriousness of the procedure ( morally , physically and/or emotionally). ` Termination of pregnancy ' is the most commonly used term to describe induced abortion<disease> in patient consultations in Scotland. This and the term ` abortion<disease> ' appear to play different roles , with the former being used euphemistically , and the latter as a more emphatic term. Further research is warranted to investigate how this interacts with patient care , service provision , and abortion<disease> stigma.
