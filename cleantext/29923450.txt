  Sacral insufficiency fractures ( SIFs) can cause severe lower back pain and immobility , which have limited therapeutic options. No previous studies have compared clinical outcomes and radiographic findings of sacroplasty with or without balloon assistance for the treatment of SIFs. Forty-five patients with SIFs were divided into two groups. One group had 18 patients treated using sacroplasty with balloon assistance , and the other had 27 patients treated without balloon assistance. The operation time and cement injection volume were compared between these two groups. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using visual analog scale ( VAS) , Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI) , and Odom 's criteria. Cement leakage rate was examined by postoperative radiography and computed tomography. Sacroplasty with balloon assistance was associated with significantly longer operative time ( p = 0.003) and larger cement injection volume ( p = 0.038). Cement leakages were found in 4 of 18 patients ( 22.2 %) with balloon assistance and 15 of 27 patients ( 55.6 %) without balloon assistance , which showed significant difference ( p = 0.027). No significant differences were observed between sacroplasty with and without balloon assistance with regard to clinical outcomes including improvement in VAS , ODI , and Odom 's criteria. Sacroplasty with balloon assistance was shown to achieve greater cement injection with longer operation time and can decrease the risk of cement leakage. Both sacroplasty with and without balloon assistance showed good-to-excellent clinical outcomes for the treatment of SIFs.
