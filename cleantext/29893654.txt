  Antibiotic use varies widely between hospitals , but the influence of antimicrobial stewardship programs ( ASPs) on this variability is not known. We aimed to determine the key structural and strategic aspects of ASPs associated with differences in risk-adjusted antibiotic utilization across facilities. Observational study of acute-care hospitals in Ontario , Canada METHODS: A survey was sent to hospitals asking about both structural ( 8 elements) and strategic ( 32 elements) components of their ASP. Antibiotic use from hospital purchasing data was acquired for January 1 to December 31 , 2014. Crude and adjusted defined daily doses per 1,000 patient days , accounting for hospital and aggregate patient characteristics , were calculated across facilities. Rate ratios ( RR) of defined daily doses per 1,000 patient days were compared for hospitals with and without each antimicrobial stewardship element of interest. Of 127 eligible hospitals , 73 ( 57 %) participated in the study. There was a 7-fold range in antibiotic use across these facilities ( min , 253 defined daily doses per 1,000 patient days; max , 1,872 defined daily doses per 1,000 patient days). The presence of designated funding or resources for the ASP ( RRadjusted , 0 · 87; 95 % CI , 0 · 75-0 · 99) , prospective audit and feedback ( RRadjusted , 0 · 80; 95 % CI , 0 · 67-0 · 96) , and intravenous-to-oral conversion policies ( RRadjusted , 0 · 79; 95 % CI , 0 · 64-0 · 99) were associated with lower risk-adjusted antibiotic use. Wide variability in antibiotic use across hospitals may be partially explained by both structural and strategic ASP elements. The presence of funding and resources , prospective audit and feedback , and intravenous-to-oral conversion should be considered priority elements of a robust ASP.
