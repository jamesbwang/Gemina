  A previous post-term pregnancy is thought to influence the gestation of a subsequent pregnancy. Adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes are associated with post-term pregnancy and routine induction of labour by 42 To determine the recurrence rate of a post-term pregnancy and the need for repeat induction of labour. This observational cohort study featured women with a first and second singleton pregnancy , based on data recorded in the Aberdeen Maternity and Neonatal Databank ( 1986-2012). Term and post-term pregnancies were defined as â‰¥ 37 The study population consisted of 25,669 women with 33 % of the women delivering post-term in their first pregnancy. In these women , the rate of a subsequent post-term pregnancy was 35.7 % compared to 18.6 % for women with an initial term pregnancy ( adjusted odds ratio ( aOR) 2.27 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 2.11-2.44). Compared to women who had spontaneous term deliveries in both pregnancies , women who were induced post-term in the second pregnancy had increased odds of having been induced post-term in their first pregnancy. The adjusted odds ratio was found to be 6.08 ( 95 % CI 5.30-6.98). Women with a first post-term pregnancy are less likely to labour spontaneously and more likely to have a second post-term pregnancy with a higher risk of repeat induction of labour , than women who have previously delivered at term. These findings could be useful in the counselling of women with a previous post-term pregnancy. Given that these women are less likely to labour spontaneously , the offer of an elective induction could also be considered to potentially improve maternal and perinatal outcomes.
