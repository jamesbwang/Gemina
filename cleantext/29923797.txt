  PARP1 inhibitors are approved therapeutic agents in ovarian carcinomas , and have clinical activity in some breast cancers. As a single agent , niraparib killed ovarian and mammary tumor cells via an ATM-AMPK-ULK1 pathway which resulted in mTOR inactivation and the formation of autophagosomes , temporally followed by autolysosome formation. In parallel , niraparib activated a CD95-FADD-caspase 8 pathway , and collectively these signals caused tumor cell death that was suppressed by knock down of Beclin1 , ATG5 , CD95 , FADD or AIF; or by expression of c-FLIP-s , BCL-XL or dominant negative caspase 9. The HDAC inhibitors AR42 and sodium valproate enhanced niraparib lethality in a greater than additive fashion. HDAC inhibitors enhanced niraparib lethality by increasing activation of the ATM-AMPK-ULK1-autophagy and CD95-FADD-caspase 8 pathways. Knock down of eIF2α , ATM , AMPKα , ULK1 , Beclin1 or ATG5 reduced tumor cell killing by the niraparib plus HDAC inhibitor combination. Blockade of either caspase 9 function or that of cathepsin B partially prevented cell death. As a single agent niraparib delayed tumor growth , but did not significantly alter the tumor control rate. Tumors previously exposed to niraparib had activated the ERK1/2 and AKT-mTOR pathways that correlated with increased plasma levels of IL-8 , MIF , EGF , uPA and IL-12. Collectively our findings argue that the addition of HDAC inhibitors to niraparib enhances the anti-cancer activity of the PARP1 inhibitor niraparib.
