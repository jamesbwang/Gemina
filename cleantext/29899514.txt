  Short timescale observations are valuable for understanding microbial ecological processes. We assessed dynamics in relative abundance and potential activities by sequencing the small sub-unit ribosomal RNA gene ( rRNA gene) and rRNA molecules ( rRNA) of Bacteria , Archaea , and Eukaryota once to twice daily between March 2014 and May 2014 from the surface ocean off Catalina Island , California. Typically Ostreococcus , Braarudosphaera , Teleaulax , and Synechococcus dominated phytoplankton sequences ( including chloroplasts) while SAR11 , Sulfitobacter , and Fluviicola dominated non-phytoplankton Bacteria and Archaea. We observed short-lived increases of diatoms , mostly Pseudo-nitzschia and Chaetoceros , with quickly responding Bacteria and Archaea including Flavobacteriaceae ( Polaribacter & Formosa) , Roseovarius , and Euryarchaeota ( MGII) , notably the exact amplicon sequence variants we observed responding similarly to another diatom bloom nearby , 3 years prior. We observed correlations representing known interactions among abundant phytoplankton rRNA sequences , demonstrating the biogeochemical and ecological relevance of such interactions: ( 1) The kleptochloroplastidic ciliate Mesodinium 18S rRNA gene sequences and a single Teleaulax taxon ( via 16S rRNA gene sequences) were correlated ( Spearman r = 0.83) yet uncorrelated to a Teleaulax 18S rRNA gene OTU , or any other taxon ( consistent with a kleptochloroplastidic or karyokleptic relationship) and ( 2) the photosynthetic prymnesiophyte Braarudosphaera bigelowii and two strains of diazotrophic cyanobacterium UCYN-A were correlated and each taxon was also correlated to other taxa , including B. bigelowii to a verrucomicrobium and a dictyochophyte phytoplankter ( all r > 0.8). We also report strong correlations ( r > 0.7) between various ciliates , bacteria , and phytoplankton , suggesting interactions via currently unknown mechanisms. These data reiterate the utility of high-frequency time series to show rapid microbial reactions to stimuli , and provide new information about in situ dynamics of previously recognized and hypothesized interactions.
