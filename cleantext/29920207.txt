  Solid polymer electrolytes ( SPEs) have shown extraordinary promise for all-solid-state lithium metal batteries with high energy density and flexibility but are mainly limited by low ionic conductivity and their poor stability with lithium metal anodes. In this work , we propose a highly ordered porous electrolyte additive derived from SSZ-13 for high-rate all-solid-state lithium metal batteries. The nanoporous adsorption effect provided by the highly ordered porous nanoparticles in the poly ( ethylene oxide) ( PEO) electrolyte is found to significantly improve the Li
