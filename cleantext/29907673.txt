  T-lymphocyte apoptosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE). However , the underlying regulatory mechanisms of apoptosis in SLE remain unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the role of miR-98 in SLE and its underlying mechanisms. Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription PCR ( qRT-PCR) were used to analyze miR-98 and Fas expression. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to identify miR-98 targets. To modify miRNA levels , miR-98 mimics and inhibitor were transfected into cells. A lentiviral construct was used to overexpress the level of Fas in SLE CD4 + T cells. Gene and protein expression were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Apoptosis levels were evaluated by annexin V staining and flow cytometry. Compared to those of healthy donors , miR-98 was downregulated in SLE CD4 + T cells , whereas Fas mRNA and protein expression were upregulated. Upregulation of miR-98 by mimic transfection protected Jurkat cells against Fas-mediated apoptosis at both mRNA and protein levels , while miR-98 inhibitor induced the completely opposite effect. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-98 directly targeted Fas mRNA. Further , miR-98 inhibitor induced apoptosis in primary healthy CD4 + T cells through the Fas-caspase axis , while upregulation of miR-98 in SLE CD4 + T cells led to the opposite effect. The current study revealed that downregulation of miR-98 induces apoptosis by modulating the Fas-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway in SLE CD4 + T cells. These results suggest that miR-98 might serve as a potential target for SLE treatment.
