  Neurosyphilis remains a diagnostic challenge in current psychiatric practice because of its pleomorphic psychiatric manifestations. Although neurosyphilis can present with a wide range of psychiatric symptoms , psychotic mania as its solitary manifestation is an unusual phenomenon. A 46-year-old man , with no history of any psychiatric disorder , exhibited abruptly developed symptoms of psychotic mania. He was admitted to a psychiatric ward for further evaluation and treatment. Upon admission , his cognitive function was unimpaired , and the hyperactivity was not severe. Also , no abnormalities were found upon neurological examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging. He was initially diagnosed as bipolar disorder with psychotic features. On the 3rd day after admission , he was confirmed as having neurosyphilis by analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and treated with intravenous penicillin-in combination with blonanserin-an atypical antipsychotic drug. After 2 weeks of treatment , most of the symptoms had abated. The present case emphasizes that patients presenting with atypical psychiatric manifestation should be screened for possible syphilis<disease> , particularly in the absence of previous psychiatric history , and suggests that combination of blonanserin with antibiotic therapy may be effective in the treatment of the manic and psychotic symptoms secondary to neurosyphilis.
