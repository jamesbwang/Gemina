  A chiral auxiliary-based diastereoselective transformation that entirely avoids the stereochemically mismatched pairing , providing equally high levels of asymmetric induction in the formation of each diastereomer is described. In particular , we show that chiral nonracemic methyl ketones undergo α,α-bisalkylation using phenylalanine-derived N-amino cyclic carbamate ( ACC) auxiliaries with essentially perfect diastereoselectivity , as well as excellent yield and regioselectivity. Significantly , with the use of a single enantiomer of the auxiliary , either diastereomeric product can be synthesized with an equally high level of asymmetric induction.
