  The industry of nanotechnology has had a rapid development in the last decades. In particular , silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs) have unique properties so they can be used in different industrial applications , mainly in areas such as electronics , environment , medicine , biosensors and biotechnology; as well as household and healthcare-related products , like cosmetics , due to their antimicrobial properties. These beneficial effects are also offset by the higher chemical reactivity of these NPs due to their surface area to volume ratio , leading to the increased formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) within cells. AgNPs , however , have a dark side: they increase the formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS). With increased human exposure to AgNPs , the risk and safety standards have attracted much attention. This review highlights the beneficial and toxicological effects of AgNPs in terms of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity.
