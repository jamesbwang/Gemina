  Osteoporotic fractures cause significant morbidity and mortality. To update the evidence on screening and treatment to prevent osteoporotic fractures for the US Preventive Services Task Force. PubMed , the Cochrane Library , EMBASE , and trial registries ( November 1 , 2009 , through October 1 , 2016) and surveillance of the literature ( through March 23 , 2018); bibliographies from articles. Adults 40 years and older; screening cohorts without prevalent low-trauma fractures or treatment cohorts with increased fracture risk; studies assessing screening , bone measurement tests or clinical risk assessments , pharmacologic treatment. Dual , independent review of titles/abstracts and full-text articles; study quality rating; random-effects meta-analysis. Incident fractures and related morbidity and mortality , diagnostic and predictive accuracy , harms of screening or treatment. One hundred sixty-eight fair- or good-quality articles were included. One randomized clinical trial ( RCT) ( n = 12483) comparing screening with no screening reported fewer hip fractures ( 2.6 % vs 3.5 %; hazard ratio ( HR) , 0.72 ( 95 % CI , 0.59-0.89)) but no other statistically significant benefits or harms. The accuracy of bone measurement tests to identify osteoporosis varied ( area under the curve ( AUC) , 0.32-0.89). The pooled accuracy of clinical risk assessments for identifying osteoporosis ranged from AUC of 0.65 to 0.76 in women and from 0.76 to 0.80 in men; the accuracy for predicting fractures was similar. For women , bisphosphonates , parathyroid hormone , raloxifene , and denosumab were associated with a lower risk of vertebral fractures ( 9 trials ( n = 23690); relative risks ( RRs) from 0.32-0.64). Bisphosphonates ( 8 RCTs ( n = 16438); pooled RR , 0.84 ( 95 % CI , 0.76-0.92)) and denosumab ( 1 RCT ( n = 7868); RR , 0.80 ( 95 % CI , 0.67-0.95)) were associated with a lower risk of nonvertebral fractures. Denosumab reduced the risk of hip fracture ( 1 RCT ( n = 7868); RR , 0.60 ( 95 % CI , 0.37-0.97)) , but bisphosphonates did not have a statistically significant association ( 3 RCTs ( n = 8988); pooled RR , 0.70 ( 95 % CI , 0.44-1.11)). Evidence was limited for men: zoledronic acid reduced the risk of radiographic vertebral fractures ( 1 RCT ( n = 1199); RR , 0.33 ( 95 % CI , 0.16-0.70)); no studies demonstrated reductions in clinical or hip fractures. Bisphosphonates were not consistently associated with reported harms other than deep vein thrombosis ( raloxifene vs placebo; 3 RCTs ( n = 5839); RR , 2.14 ( 95 % CI , 0.99-4.66)). In women , screening to prevent osteoporotic fractures may reduce hip fractures , and treatment reduced the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures; there was not consistent evidence of treatment harms. The accuracy of bone measurement tests or clinical risk assessments for identifying osteoporosis or predicting fractures varied from very poor to good.
