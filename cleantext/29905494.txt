  Physical activity is important to reduce mortality , morbidity and risk factors in patients with coronary heart disease. This report evaluates to what extent patients are still physically active following an exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programme 12-14 months post-myocardial infarction and factors predicting why not. Data from the National Quality Registry Swedeheart with post-myocardial infarction patients ( n = 368) admitted from July 2012 to November 2014 were collected with outcomes of physical activity after 12-14 months. Baseline data included demographics , clinical variables , participation in exercise programmes , prescribed physical activity , health-related quality of life and self-reported health ( EQ-5D-3L/ EQ-VAS). A direct binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify indicators of low physical activity. Physical activity frequency per week ( PA/week) was low , i.e. zero to three times , in older patients over 64 years ( P = 0.00) and in those having problems with pain/discomfort ( 138 PA/week vs. 195) ( P = 0.01) , problems with mobility ( 60 PA/week vs. 273) ( P = 0.04) and anxiety/depression ( 128 PA/week vs. 205) ( P = 0.04). Indicators predicting low physical activity can be used targeting improved post-myocardial infarction care outlining person-centred rehabilitation programmes and specialist nursing-led programmes.
