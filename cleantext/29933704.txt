  Herbal supplements are widely used during pregnancy , although there are insufficient data regarding their efficacy and safety. Some of them have been associated with hypertension , including licorice , which induces the so called mineralocorticoid-excess syndrome<disease> , a clinical picture resembling to pseudohyperaldosteronism. This action is mediated via inhibition of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 ( 11-HSD2) , leading to impaired inactivation of cortisol to cortisone , accumulation of cortisol , and finally to excessive mineralocorticoid activity , especially in the distal and cumulative tubule of kidneys. This syndrome<disease> is characterized by hypertension and hypokalemia. Herein , we report a case of a 37-year-old pregnant woman , who was referred from obstetrics department to our department due to persistent hypertension and hypokalemia. She consumed a herbal supplement called `` mumijo '' during the last 6 months. After a thorough diagnostic work-up , the diagnosis of a `` licorice-like syndrome<disease> '' due to mumijo consumption was made. Potassium supplementation at the acute phase and discontinuation of mumijo were the treatment of choice. This is the first report of pseudohyperaldosteronism due to mumijo consumption in literature. Clinicians should be aware of this side effect and this agent should be included in those causing pseudohyperaldosteronism. Besides all , our case highlights the undeniable value of a detailed medical history.
