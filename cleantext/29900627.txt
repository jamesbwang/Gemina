  Through the construction of an organic photocatalysis system , photoredox catalyst ( PC)/ additive , where PC stands for photoredox catalyst , an organocatalyzed step transfer-addition and radical-termination ( O-START) polymerization irradiated by blue LED light at room temperature is realized. Different types of α,ω-diiodoperfluoroalkane A and α,ω-unconjugated diene B are copolymerized through O-START efficiently , and generate various kinds of functional semifluorinated polymers , including polyolefins and polyesters. The process is affected by several factors; solvents , additives , and feed ratio of A to B. After optimization of all these components , the polymerization efficiency is greatly improved , generating polymers with both relatively high yield and molecular weight. Considering the mild reaction condition , easy operation process , and free-of-metal-catalyst residues in the polymer product , the organocatalytic polymerization strategy provides a simple and efficient approach to functional semifluorinated polymer materials and hopefully opens up their application in high-tech fields.
