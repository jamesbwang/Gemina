  The emergence of symbiotic interactions has been studied using population genomics in nature and experimental evolution in the laboratory , but the parallels between these processes remain unknown. Here we compare the emergence of rhizobia after the horizontal transfer of a symbiotic plasmid in natural populations of Cupriavidus<pathogen> taiwanensis<pathogen> , over 10 MY ago , with the experimental evolution of symbiotic Ralstonia<pathogen> solanacearum for a few hundred generations. In spite of major differences in terms of time span , environment , genetic background , and phenotypic achievement , both processes resulted in rapid genetic diversification dominated by purifying selection. We observe no adaptation in the plasmid carrying the genes responsible for the ecological transition. Instead , adaptation was associated with positive selection in a set of genes that led to the co-option of the same quorum-sensing system in both processes. Our results provide evidence for similarities in experimental and natural evolutionary transitions and highlight the potential of comparisons between both processes to understand symbiogenesis.
