  Alcohol 's harms to others ( AHTO) may cause substantial distress , particularly when harms are perpetrated by close others. One challenge to identifying causal impacts is that people harmed by drinkers differ in many ways from those not so harmed , so our aim was to assess mental health in relation to two serious types of AHTO , financial harm and assault by someone who had been drinking , using propensity score ( PS) weighting to adjust for potentially confounding differences. Cross-sectional , nationally representative , random sample of adults. United States. Seventy-six respondents reporting financial harm compared with 4625 with no past-year AHTO; 192 respondents reporting assault compared with 4623 with no past-year AHTO. Predictors were reported exposure to financial problems due to someone 's drinking and assault by someone who had been drinking. Mental health outcomes were quality of life , distress and positive affect. Confounders included family history of alcohol problems , child physical/sexual abuse , substance use/dependence , impacts of recent economic recession , racial/ethnic discrimination , poverty and other demographics. In double-robust PS weighted models for financial harm , there were associations with reduced quality of life ( B = -0.28 , P = 0.02) and increased distress ( adjusted odds ratio ( aOR) = 4.69 , P < 0.001) , and for assault by a partner or family member , there were associations with increased distress ( aOR = 2.23 , P = 0.09). For assault by a friend or stranger , none of the associations are statistically significant after PS weighting ( all P > 0.10). Financial troubles due to someone else 's drinking and assaults perpetrated by drinking intimates ( spouses , other partners or family members) are associated with reduced mental health.
