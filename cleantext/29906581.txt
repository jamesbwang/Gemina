  Lumboperitoneal shunt ( LPS) has been demonstrated an effective method for the treatment of communicating hydrocephalus<symptom> in the presence of frequent shunt failure. The objective of the present study was to determine whether establishing a preoperative evaluation system could benefit patients , thus attenuating the risk of LPS failure. In this 3-year study , treated by LPS , patients undergoing preoperative evaluation were included into the study group and other individuals without preoperative evaluation were included into the control group. Perioperative conditions , including Keifer 's hydrocephalus score , symptomatic control rate , Evans index , complications , long-term shunt revision rate , and quality of life , were synchronously investigated. A total of 93 eligible patients were included in the study ( study group , 51; control group , 42). The baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were basically similar. The results showed that patients in the study group had better short-term improvement in symptoms and imageology , including higher symptomatic control rate ( median , 62.5 % vs. 50 %; P = 0.001) , more reduction in Evans index ( 0.08 ± 0.05 vs. 0.05 ± 0.04; P = 0.002) , and lower incidence of postoperative complications ( median , 35.3 % vs. 57.1 %; P = 0.04). Similarly , the incidence of shunt revision in the study group was dramatically lower than in the control group ( median , 15.7 % vs. 40.9 %; P = 0.006) in line with the revision-free curve ( P = 0.002) , which suggested that most of patients received revision , if needed , within 3 months. In addition , patients in the study group had better quality of life. In conclusion , patients who underwent evaluation before LPS had better short-term and long-term outcomes , suggesting that it would be a promising strategy to correctly select patients for LPS with prolonged favorable shunt outcomes.
