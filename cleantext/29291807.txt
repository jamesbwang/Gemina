  In this work , a sensitive electrochemical immunosensor has been reported for the determination of norfloxacin in animal-derived foods. The poly ( amidoamine) dendrimer encapsulated gold nanoparticles ( PAMAM-Au) played dual roles in the proposed sensing platform which not only accelerated the electron transfer process of sensing , but also increased the efficiency of the immobilized antibody. The HRP-labeled antigen , as the signal labels in the immunosensor , was introduced to catalyze the following reaction of the substrate hydroquinone with the aid of H ₂ O ₂ in the competitive reaction. On the basis of the signal amplification of PAMAM-Au , the signal intensity was linearly related to the concentration of norfloxacin in the range of 1 & mu; g & middot; L
