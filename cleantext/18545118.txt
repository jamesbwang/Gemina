  Surgical stabilization of displaced midshaft clavicle fracture can be achieved by an intramedullary nail or plate. When intramedullary nail is used , one of the dreaded complications is the migration of nail. We have used a screw intramedullary device with screw mechanism at one end which can get hold in the medial cancellous bone , thus preventing chances of nail migration. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical outcome following elastic stable screw intramedullary nailing for the fixation of midshaft clavicle fractures. 36 patients of midshaft clavicular fractures , who met inclusion criteria , were included in this retrospective study. There were 28 males and 8 females. The mean age was 36.6 years. Twenty one patients were managed by close reduction and fixation with screw intramedullary nail. Fifteen patients required mini-open reduction. Followup examination was done at 1 month , 3 months , and 6 months using patient 's subjective evaluation , functional outcome , radiographic assessment , and other complications. Union was achieved at average of 11.6 weeks in 31 cases and five patients went to delayed union. The average followup was 6 months. The average constant score was 90 %. Three patients had medial nail protrusion which required early removal after union. Screw intramedullary nail is a safe , minimally invasive surgical technique with a lower complication rate , faster return to daily activities , excellent cosmetic and good functional results , and can be used as an equally effective alternative to plate fixation in displaced midshaft clavicle fractures.
