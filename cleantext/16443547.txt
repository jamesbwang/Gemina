  Tumor necrosis<symptom> factor superfamily member 4 ( TNFSF4) , also known as Ox40 ligand ( Ox40l) , plays an important role in atherosclerosis development. Several studies reported the association between the rs3850641 polymorphism of the TNFSF4 gene and the risk of myocardial infarction ( MI). However , the results are inconsistent. In order to explore the relationship between the rs3850641 polymorphism of the TNFSF4 gene and MI , we conducted a case-control study including 454 cases and 512 controls in a Chinese Han population. Genotyping was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The present study found that AA genotype ( AA vs. GG: odds ratio ( OR) & 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 2.00 ( 1.04,3.86) ,
