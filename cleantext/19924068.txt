  Reversible amorphous-crystalline phase transitions are studied using complementary ultrafast differential scanning calorimetry and transmission electron microscopy techniques , which together allow a wealth of thermal and structural properties to be determined. The SeTe ( As) system is investigated because these chalcogenide based materials have favorable properties as a phase-change memory material and in optical systems. Using calorimetry , we find that the addition of 10 at. % As to SeTe alloys strongly increases their glass forming ability , increasing both glass transition and crystallization temperatures while reducing critical quench rate. Ex situ investigation of Se
