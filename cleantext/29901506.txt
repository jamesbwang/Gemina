  This study aimed to evaluate the performance of an automated workflow of volumetric liver proton density fat fraction ( PDFFvol) and R2 * quantification with automated inline liver volume ( LV) segmentation. Dual-echo and multiecho Dixon magnetic resonance images were evaluated in 74 consecutive patients ( group A , PDFF < 10 %; B , PDFF ≥ 10 %; C , R2 * ≥ 100 s; D , post-hemihepatectomy). The values of PDFFvol and R2 * vol measurements across the LV were generated on multiecho images in an automated fashion based on inline liver segmentation on dual-echo images. Similar measurements were performed manually. Using the inline algorithm , the mis-segmented LV was highest in group D ( 80 %). There were no significant differences between automated and manual measurements of PDFFvol. Automated R2 * vol was significantly lower than manual R2 * vol in group A ( P = 0.004). Inline LV segmentation performed well in patients without and with hepatic steatosis. In cases with iron overload and post-hemihepatectomy , extrahepatic areas were erroneously included to a greater extent , with a tendency toward overestimation of PDFFvol.
