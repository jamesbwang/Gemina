  We report here a case of intraventricular schwannoma. This location is rare. Our patient was a 68-year-old female with a large intraventricular lesion<symptom> of the body of the lateral ventricle on the right side. Brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) revealed this lesion<symptom>. After a right parietotemporal craniotomy , microsurgical excision using neuronavigation was performed to completely remove the tumor. Histological and immunohistochemical examination confirmed the diagnosis of intraventricular schwannoma devoid of atypical features. Postoperative MRI showed macroscopically complete tumor removal with no recurrence after 12 months of follow-up. A review of the literature identified 32 such cases published to date.
