  Kidd blood group alloimmunisation , though extremely rare , may produce considerable morbidity , and even mortality. Severe anaemia and impending high-output cardiac failure requiring blood transfusion should be weighed against the risk of severe transfusion reactions even with fully cross-matched blood. Kidd antibodies are a common cause of delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction ( DHTR) since they have a tendency remain undetectable in plasma. A low- grade DHTR ( second hit) was grossly amplified by a second DHTR ( third hit) superimposed on it in our patient leading to severe haemolysis with serum bilirubin reaching 68 mg %. Indirect antiglobulin test ( indirect Coombs reaction) should ideally be performed in all patients ( scheduled for major surgery requiring blood transfusion) who have experienced a previous pregnancy or blood transfusion. Non-invasive continuous haemoglobin monitoring and non-invasive cardiac output monitoring can prove invaluable tools in management.
