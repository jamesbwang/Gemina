  Current acute<symptom> pain<symptom> intensity assessment tools are mainly based on self-reporting by patients , which is impractical for non-communicative , sedated or critically ill patients. In previous studies , various physiological signals have been observed qualitatively as a potential pain intensity index. On the basis of that , this study aims at developing a continuous<symptom> pain<symptom> monitoring method with the classification of multiple physiological parameters. Heart rate ( HR) , breath rate ( BR) , galvanic skin<symptom> response<symptom> ( GSR) and facial surface electromyogram were collected from 30 healthy volunteers under thermal and electrical pain stimuli. The collected samples were labelled as no pain , mild<symptom> pain<symptom> or moderate/severe pain based on a self-reported visual analogue scale. The patterns of these three classes were first observed from the distribution of the 13 processed physiological parameters. Then , artificial neural network classifiers were trained , validated and tested with the physiological parameters. The average classification accuracy was 70.6 %. The same method was applied to the medians of each class in each test and accuracy was improved to 83.3 %. With facial electromyogram , the adaptivity of this method to a new subject was improved as the recognition accuracy of moderate/severe pain in leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was promoted from 74.9 ± 21.0 to 76.3 ± 18.1 %. Among healthy volunteers , GSR , HR and BR were better correlated to pain intensity variations than facial muscle activities. The classification of multiple accessible physiological parameters can potentially provide a way to differentiate among no , mild and moderate/severe acute experimental pain.
