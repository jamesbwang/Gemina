  Although numerous studies have indicated the significance of parental support and parent-child communication in alleviating the adverse effects of parental departure on left-behind children , researchers have rarely addressed the impact of parent education on migrant parents. On the basis of the results of a pilot randomized controlled trial , the study reported here involved examining the possible outcomes and feasibility of a parent education program for rural-to-urban migrant mothers of left-behind children in China. Informed by an existential-narrative approach to parent education , the program was composed of six 2.5-hour sessions. The sample included 56 migrant mothers recruited from a social service center in Shenzhen , China , who were randomly assigned to either the immediate group ( n = 28 , M = 34.82 years , SD = 4.12 , aged 23-43) or the waitlist control group ( n = 28 , M = 34.68 years , SD = 4.53 , aged 28-43). The hypotheses of the trial were twofold: that the program would positively affect participants ' parental identity and that it would improve mother-child relationships and parenting practices. The results revealed no significant difference in parental identity between the intervention group and the waitlist control group at the post-test assessment after ruling out the effects of pretest survey scores. However , significant differences did emerge in parent-child relationships and parenting practices. Overall , the results corroborate the feasibility of examining the current program for migrant mothers in China in a full trial. The findings also offer insights into developing empirically supported parent education programs for migrant parents.
