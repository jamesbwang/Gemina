  Thioxanthone ( TX) , an aromatic ketone , exhibits significant solvent-dependent photophysical properties. Herein , we employed time-resolved ultrafast Raman loss spectroscopy ( URLS) to decipher the solvent-dependent structural dynamics in entangled singlet and triplet states of photoexcited TX. The evolution of the vibrational spectrum reveals structural changes that occur during the intersystem-crossing ( ISC) process and the subsequent energy dissipation to the surrounding solvent.
