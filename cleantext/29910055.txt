  Hypertension is common in patients with coarctation of the aorta ( CoA) , even after successful repair. Increased aortic stiffness has been implicated in the pathology of CoA-associated hypertension. This study aimed to investigate aortic vascular function and its relationship with hypertension in well-repaired CoA-patients at long-term follow-up. Furthermore , we assessed the additive effect of hypertension to adverse arterioventricular coupling associated with increased aortic stiffness. Twenty-two CoA-patients ( age 30 ± 10.6 years) with successful surgical repair ( n = 12) or balloon angioplasty ( BA) ( n = 10) between 3 months and 16 years of age with a follow-up of > 10 years and 22 healthy controls underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR) , at mean follow-up of 29.3 years , to study aortic pulse wave velocity ( PWV) , aortic distensibility , global left ventricular ( LV) function , LV dimensions , and LV myocardial deformation. CoA-patients had significantly increased aortic arch PWV ( 5.6 ± 1.9 m/s vs. 4.5 ± 1.0 m/s , P = .02) and decreased distensibility ( 4.5 ± 1.8 × 10-3 mmHg Central aortic stiffness is significantly increased in well-repaired CoA-patients long-term after repair , and is associated with hypertension. Global LV function , myocardial deformation indices and LV dimensions are however preserved.
