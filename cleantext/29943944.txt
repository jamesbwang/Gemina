  The aim of the study was to explore the reasons why people do not always wait to receive treatment after registering in emergency departments ( EDs). Patients who attended the ED at a general hospital in the south of England and left without being seen ( LWBS) were recorded between 1 June and 31 August 2016 and 597 patient records were analysed. Six patients participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were manually coded. The most common presenting complaint for people who LWBS was limb problems , however some had potentially more serious conditions such as chest<symptom> pain<symptom>. The six interviewees accessed the ED because of a perceived urgent need , and reasons for leaving before being seen included long waiting time , other commitments , non-availability of specialty services , perceiving their problem as less urgent , resolution of condition and discomfort in the waiting area. People who LWBS may not have trivial health problems , which is a risk for them and hospital trusts. Although many of the people who LWBS did so because of the lengthy waiting time , there may be other factors involved some of which could be prevented.
