  A ruthenium-catalyzed carbocyclization of 2-alkynylstyrenes that involves a very rare 1,2-carbon migration of internal alkynes is reported. Various 1,2-di- and 1,4,7-trisubstituted naphthalenes are synthesized. Mechanistic studies revealed that this reaction proceeds via a disubstituted vinylidene complex as the key intermediate by 1,2-carbon migration of the 2-alkynylstyrenes.
