  We sought factors associated with the development of brain metastases after treatment of small cell lung cancer ( SCLC) in patients without brain involvement at diagnosis. We analyzed 293 patients with SCLC without brain metastases who received chemotherapy , thoracic radiation therapy ( TRT) , or both in 2001-2015. Pretreatment hematologic markers ( platelet count , neutrophil count , lymphocyte<symptom> count , neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio , platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio , and lactate dehydrogenase) and other clinical characteristics were evaluated for correlation with brain metastases-free survival ( BMFS). Cutoffs were established with receiver operating characteristics curves. Factors significant in univariate analysis were used to build a multivariate Cox model for BMFS. Median follow-up time was 14.3 months. Brain metastases developed in 115 patients ( 39 %) -32 % of those with low pretreatment platelet counts ( PPC) ( ≤ 270 × 10 High PPC was associated with increased rates of brain metastasis in patients with SCLC with no evidence of brain disease at diagnosis.
