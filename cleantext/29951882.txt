  This study aimed to assess their characteristics and clinical course of each histologic type of the behavior of phyllodes tumor ( PT). We retrospectively reviewed 124 patients with PTs who underwent surgical treatment from 2003 to 2011. PTs were classified as benign , borderline , and malignant using surgical specimens. The clinicopathological characteristics according to solitary and multiple lesions<symptom> on ipsilateral breast and histological change after local recurrence were examined. The median patient age was 42 years ( range 12-72 years). The final pathologic diagnosis was benign PTs in 95 patients ( 76.6 %) , borderline PTs in 21 ( 16.9 %) , and malignant PTs in 8 ( 6.5 %). The size of benign PTs ( median 4.2 cm ( range 1-21 cm)) was significantly smaller than that of malignant PTs ( median 11.3 cm ( range 6-27 cm)) ( p < 0.001). Eight of the 95 benign PTs ( 8.4 %) had multiple lesions<symptom> , while all malignant PTs had solitary lesion<symptom>. With a median follow-up period of 45 months , five patients with malignant PTs ( 62.5 %) developed distant metastases while 13 patients with benign PTs ( 13.5 %) and 6 patients with borderline PTs ( 28.6 %) had local recurrence only without malignant transition. The median overall survival period of those with malignant PTs was 22.5 months ( range 5-109 months). Histologically benign and borderline PTs had a good prognosis without malignant transition even after developing repeat recurrence in contrast with malignant PTs that might be a solitary
