  We reviewed the most recent literature examining the associations between the Mediterranean-style diet ( MD) , neurodegenerative diseases , and markers and mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Most , but not all , epidemiologic studies report a protective association between MD adherence , cognitive impairment , and brain health. Data from clinical trials supporting these observational findings are also emerging. Limited evidence suggests that MD adherence may be protective for Parkinson 's disease risk. Mechanistically , plant polyphenols may activate similar molecular pathways as caloric restriction diets , which helps explain the neuroprotective properties of the MD.. Evidence for cognitive disorders is abundant , but there is a dearth of literature for other neurodegenerative disorders and for markers of neurodegeneration. Further research is needed to elucidate the protective role of MD on neurodegeneration , the most salient components of the MD , and the most sensitive time periods over the lifecourse at which the MD may exert its effects.
