  Smoking in pregnancy remains a global public health issue due to foetal health risks and potential maternal complications. The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to explore: ( 1) whether digital interventions for pregnancy smoking cessation are effective , ( 2) the impact of intervention platform on smoking cessation , ( 3) the associations between specific Behaviour Change Techniques ( BCTs) delivered within interventions and smoking cessation and ( 4) the association between the total number of BCTs delivered and smoking cessation. Systematic searches of 9 databases resulted in the inclusion of 12 published articles ( n = 2970). The primary meta-analysis produced a sample-weighted odds ratio ( OR) of 1.44 ( 95 % CI 1.04-2.00 , p = .03) in favour of digital interventions compared with comparison groups. Computer-based ( OR = 3.06 , 95 % CI 1.28-7.33) and text-message interventions ( OR = 1.59 , 95 % CI 1.07-2.38) were the most effective digital platform. Moderator analyses revealed seven BCTs associated with smoking cessation: information about antecedents; action planning; problem solving; goal setting ( behaviour); review behaviour goals; social support ( unspecified); and pros and cons. A meta-regression suggested that interventions using larger numbers of BCTs produced the greatest effects. This paper highlights the potential for digital interventions to improve rates of smoking cessation in pregnancy.
