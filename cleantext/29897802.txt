  Models are universal in science , both as theoretical formulations of reality and as model systems , representatives of other organisms. A recent paper on how scientists view the world divides our work into the mind , the lab , and the field and suggests that models must not be conflated with reality. But in practice , these distinctions are blurred. For example , are flour beetles a model system for other insects when their natural habitat is the same as the way they live in the lab? In addition , models can become restrictive when they are viewed as archetypes , making us overgeneralize about the world and ignoring meaningful variation. The study of sexual conflict in insects illustrates some of the pitfalls of relying on Drosophila as a model system for sexual selection. Microbes can be used as models for populations and communities and are essential parts of larger biological systems. Finally , some models are not meant to replicate the world but are worlds unto themselves in which diverse possibilities can be directly observed.
