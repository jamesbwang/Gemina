  The effectiveness of using a face mask with a small diffuser for oxygen delivery ( OxyMask) was compared to use of a high-flow nasal cannula ( HFNC) in patients with moderate or severe bronchiolitis.The study population in this open , phase 4 , randomized controlled trial consisted of 60 patients aged 1-24 months diagnosed with moderate or severe bronchiolitis<disease> and admitted to an intensive care unit ( ICU) for oxygen therapy. The patients were randomized into two groups according to the method of oxygen delivery: a diffuser mask group and an HFNC group.There were seven failures in the mask group and none in the HFNC group. The survival probability differed significantly between the two treatment methods ( p = 0.009). Time to weaning off oxygen therapy was 56 h in the HFNC group and 96 h in the mask group ( p < 0.001). HFNC use decreased the treatment failure rate and the duration of both oxygen therapy and ICU treatment compared to the diffuser mask , which implies that an HFNC should be the first choice for treating patients admitted to the ICU with severe bronchiolitis<disease> What is known: • A high-flow nasal cannula ( HFNC) does not significantly reduce the time on oxygen compared to standard therapy in children with moderate to severe bronchiolitis<disease> Observational studies show that , since the introduction of HFNC , fewer children with bronchiolitis<disease> need intubation. For children with moderate to severe bronchiolitis<disease> there is no proof of its benefit. What Is New: • In children with moderate to severe bronchiolitis<disease> , HFNC provides faster and more effective improvement than can be achieved with a diffuser mask.
