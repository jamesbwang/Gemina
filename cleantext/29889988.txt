  We surveyed whether clinicians used the WhatsApp messaging application to view neonatal chest radiographs and asked a sub-sample to compare them with computer screen viewings. The study was conducted at three university-affiliated medical centres in Israel from June-December 2016. Questionnaires on using smartphones for professional purposes were completed by 68/71 paediatric residents and 20/28 neonatologists. In addition , 11 neonatologists viewed 20 chest radiographs on a computer screen followed by a smartphone and 10 viewed the same radiographs in the opposite order , separated by a washout period of 2 months. After another 2 months , five from each group viewed the same radiographs on a computer screen. Different interpretations between viewing modes were assessed. Most respondents used WhatsApp to send chest radiographs for consultation: 82 % of the paediatric residents and 80 % of the neonatologists. The mean number of inconsistencies in diagnosis was 3.7/ 20 between two computer views and 2.9/ 20 between computer and smartphone views ( p = 0.88) and the disease severity means were 3.7/ 20 and 2.85/ 20 , respectively ( p = 0.94). Neonatologists using WhatsApp only determined umbilical line placement in 80 % of cases. WhatsApp was reliable for preliminary interpretation of neonatal chest radiographs , but caution was needed when assessing umbilical lines.
