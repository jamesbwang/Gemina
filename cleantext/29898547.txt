  The application of innovation in agriculture technologies is very important for increasing the efficiency of agricultural production , ensuring the high productivity of plants , production quality , farm profitability , the positive balance<symptom> of used energy , and the requirements of environmental protection. Therefore , it is a scientific problem that solid and soil surfaces covered with plant residue have a negative impact on the work , traction resistance , energy consumption , and environmental pollution of tillage machines. The objective of this work was to determine the dependence of the reduction of energy consumption and CO
