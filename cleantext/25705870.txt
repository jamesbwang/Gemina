  Metasurfaces enable manipulation of light propagation at an unprecedented level , benefitting from a number of merits unavailable to conventional optical elements , such as ultracompactness , precise phase and polarization control at deep subwavelength scale , and multifunctionalities. Recent progress in this field has witnessed a plethora of functional metasurfaces , ranging from lenses and vortex beam generation to holography. However , research endeavors have been mainly devoted to static devices , exploiting only a glimpse of opportunities that metasurfaces can offer. We demonstrate a dynamic metasurface platform , which allows independent manipulation of addressable subwavelength pixels at visible frequencies through controlled chemical reactions. In particular , we create dynamic metasurface holograms for advanced optical information processing and encryption. Plasmonic nanorods tailored to exhibit hierarchical reaction kinetics upon hydrogenation/dehydrogenation constitute addressable pixels in multiplexed metasurfaces. The helicity of light , hydrogen , oxygen , and reaction duration serve as multiple keys to encrypt the metasurfaces. One single metasurface can be deciphered into manifold messages with customized keys , featuring a compact data storage scheme as well as a high level of information security. Our work suggests a novel route to protect and transmit classified data , where highly restricted access of information is imposed.
