  Objective- to access seasonal variation of microvolt T-wave alternans of ECG dispersion mapping in patients with cardiovascular disease and healthy subjects. ECG data of the three groups of healthy subjects have been compared: inhabitants of Beirut , Lebanon ( n = 51) , inhabitants of Moscow , Russia ( n = 94) and ECG data of healthy subjects ( n = 44) from the testing ECG database of the PTB- The National Metrology Institute of Germany as well as a group of patients with cardiovascular disease ( n = 138) , inhabitants of Beirut , Lebanon. Microvolt T-wave alternans of ECG dispersion mapping was evaluated in three points- Tbeginning , Tmaximum , Tend. In healthy subjects , the seasonal variation of ECG dispersion mapping microvolt T-wave alternans was nonexistent. Myocardial lesion<symptom> is characterized by an increase in Tbeg , Tmax , Tend in relation to the healthy individuals. Tbeg values are minimal in winter and summer and increase in spring and autumn. Tend values were reversed- they were maximal in winter and summer , decreasing in spring-autumn period. Seasonal variation of Tmax- Tbeg , and Tmax- Tend was detected: Tmax- Tbeg increased in the winter-summer period and decreased in spring and autumn , Tmax-Tend- increased in the spring-autumn period in relation to the winter-summer period. In patients with cardiovascular disease , in contrast to the healthy , there is a seasonal variation in microvolt T-wave alternans of ECG dispersion mapping , with the maximum differences in the winter and spring seasons , which should be taken into account when applying the method in clinical practice.
