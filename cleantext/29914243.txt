  Background/aim: This study was designed to develop a Behçet 's disease ( BD) symptom assessment scale based on the theory of unpleasant symptoms , which deals with understanding symptom experiences in a disease. Materials and methods: The BD Symptom Assessment Scale has two sections: the factors influencing symptoms and the situations influenced by symptoms. Both of these sections were developed through an initial item pool , and expert opinions were consulted during a pilot test performed with 30 patients with BD. We then tested the validity and reliability of this scale on 218 different patients with BD fulfilling the ISG criteria. Finally , we scored this scale. Results: The validity and reliability study of the first section found that the scale had favorable fit indices ( X ² = 525.86 , X ²/ SD = 3.15 , GFI = 0.90 , CFI = 0.89 , IFI = 0.89) , constituting three dimensions and 20 items. The validity and reliability study of the second section found that the scale had favorable fit indices ( X ² = 579.14 , X ²/ SD = 3.48 , GFI = 0.91 , CFI = 0.89 , IFI = 0.89) and constituted three dimensions and 20 items. Conclusion: This novel symptom assessment scale for BD is a valid and reliable tool for evaluating patients with BD.
