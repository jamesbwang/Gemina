  Gyrodactylus medaka n. sp. ( Monogenea: Gyrodactylidae) is described from the skin , fins , and gills of medaka Oryzias latipes ( Beloniformes: Adrianichthyidae) from Japan. This new species was collected from wild medaka in Hiroshima , Aichi , Saga , and Kumamoto prefectures , and laboratory-reared medaka in Chiba and Aichi prefectures. The small marginal hook sickle ( ≤ 4 μm) and the length of the marginal hook of the new species are the diagnostic morphological characters differentiated from other gyrodactylids reported from Asia. The pairwise sequence divergences for the interspecific variation in ITS regions and the phylogenetic analysis suggest that the populations of G. medaka n. sp. may have a similar genetic variation as the medaka populations in Japan. Gyrodactylus medaka n. sp. and Dactylogyrus oryziasi ( Monogenea: Dactylogyridae) can maintain their populations in laboratory aquaria using medaka as their hosts , and these monogeneans and medaka have the potential as experimental model animals for clarifying various aspects of their host-parasite relationships. In addition , we report the composition of modified ammonium picrate-glycerin ( APG) and show it is advantageous for monogenean taxonomy.
