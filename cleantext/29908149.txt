  Overexpression of hexokinase 2 ( HK2) , and its binding to VDAC1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane of cancer cells , is key to their metabolic reprogramming to aerobic glycolysis , which enables them to proliferate. We describe Comp-1 , an allosteric small molecule that selectively detaches HK2 from the mitochondria. Detachment of HK2 reduces glycolysis and triggers apoptosis in cancer cells , without affecting HK1 expressing normal cells. The anti-cancer activity of Comp-1 was demonstrated in the UVB-damaged skin model in SKH-1 mice. Topical treatment with Comp-1 led to 70 % reduction in lesion<symptom> number and area. This in vivo efficacy was obtained without local skin reactions or other safety findings. Mechanism-related pharmacodynamic markers , including HK2 and cleaved Caspase 3 levels , are affected by Comp-1 treatment in vivo. GLP toxicology studies in minipigs for 28-days and 13-weeks established no systemic toxicities and minimal dermal reaction for once-daily application of up to 20 % and 15 % ointment strengths , respectively. Thus Comp-1 may address a significant unmet medical need for a non-irritating efficacious topical AK treatment.
