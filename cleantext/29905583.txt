  This article will examine the current literature , as it relates to contact lens discomfort ( CLD) secondary to contact lens solutions. The reader will better understand the characteristics of contact lenses , as they uniquely interact with each type of contact lens solution and also gain a better comprehension of the components of contact lens solution such as preservatives , surfactants , and chelating agents , which may contribute to discomfort. By investigating corneal staining theory and the mechanisms that contribute to its presence , the reader will gain insight into this clinical finding , which relates to selection of contact lens solutions. The FDA standards for testing solutions and how this relates to contact lens keratitis<disease> will also be appraised in regards to current ISO recommendations. Finally , better selection of multipurpose contact lens solution ( MPS) and hydrogen peroxide-based solutions for patients should be accessible to the clinician based on this review and preexisting clinical findings or diagnoses. A review of current published literature from peer reviewed journals and online journals was conducted to gain an understanding of contact lens solution 's impact on contact lens discomfort. Many studies have been conducted comparing comfort between various types of contact lens solutions. It is challenging to decipher this information and apply it clinically when selecting solutions for patients. By comparing solution components , how contact lens solutions interact with different types of lenses , keratitis<disease> related to contact lenses , and preexisting ocular conditions , this review will improve a clinician 's ability to eliminate CLD.
