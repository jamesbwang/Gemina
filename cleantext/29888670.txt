  Brassinosteroids ( BRs) are considered to possess protective activity in plants exposed to various stresses. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of 24-epibrassinolide ( EBL) on salt stressed summer squash cv. Eskandrani seedlings , whether it can alleviate the deleterious effects of salt stress in growing seedlings or not. For this , summer squash seeds were germinated in solidified half strength MS ( Murashige and Skoog) medium<pathogen> supplemented with different concentrations and combinations of EBL ( 0 , 5 , 10 and 20 μM) and NaCl ( 0 , 50 , 100 and 150 mM). The different concentrations ( 5 , 10 , 20 μM) of EBL significantly increased germination percentage and seedling growth capacity and the greatest increase was observed at 10 μM EBL. EBL application significantly increased the contents of photosynthetic pigments , the relative water content and the uptake of K and Ca. However , the different concentrations ( 50 , 100 and 150 mM) of NaCl significantly decreased the above-mentioned attributes. The different concentrations ( 50 , 100 and 150 mM) of NaCl significantly increased the electrolyte leakage , the lipid peroxidation and the Na uptake , but the interaction between EBL and NaCl significantly decreased these parameters. The results of this study proved that the application of 24-epibrassinolide to growing squash seedlings under salt stress conditions reduced the deleterious effects of salt stress and increased the tolerance of seedlings to its detrimental effects.
