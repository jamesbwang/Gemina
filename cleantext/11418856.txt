  Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT) , a mechanism that shares genetic material between the host and donor from separated offspring branches , has been described as a means of producing novel and beneficial phenotypes for the host organisms. In the present study , 12 HGT genes were identified from California two-spot octopus
