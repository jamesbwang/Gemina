  To investigate the association between high-fluorescence lymphocyte<symptom> cell ( HFLC) and atypical lymphocyte<symptom> ( AL) counts , and to determine the clinical significance of HFLC. We compared automated HFLC and microscopic AL counts and analyzed the findings. Patient clinical data for each specimen were reviewed. A total of 320 blood specimens were included. The correlation between HFLC and microscopic AL counts was 0.865 and 0.893 for absolute and percentage counts , respectively. Sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy of HFLC at the cutoff value of 0.1 Ã— 109 per L for detection of AL were 0.8 , 0.77 , and 0.8 , respectively. Studied patients were classified into 4 groups: infection , immunological disorders , malignant neoplasms , and others. Patients with infections had the highest HFLC. Most of those patients ( 67.7 %) had dengue infection. HFLC counts were well-correlated with AL counts with the acceptable test characteristics. Applying HFLC flagging may alert laboratory staff to be aware of ALs.
