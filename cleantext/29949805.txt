  <br> Background: 18F-FDOPA positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT) is a sensitive nuclear imaging for the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas ( PHEO). However , its utility as a predictive factor of the secretion of catecholamines remains poorly studied. Thirty-nine histologically-confirmed PHEO were included in this retrospective monocentric study. Patients underwent 18F-FDOPA PET/CT before surgery with evaluation of several uptake parameters ( SUVmax , SUVmean and the metabolic burden ( MB) calculated as follows: MB = SUVmean x tumor volume) and measurement of plasma and/or urinary metanephrine ( MN) , normetanephrine ( NM) and chromogranin A ( CGA). Thirty-five patients were screened for germline mutations in RET , SDHx and VHL genes. Once resected , primary cultures of 5 PHEO were used for real time measurement of catecholamines release by carbon fiber amperometry. The MB of the PHEO positively correlated with 24-h urinary excretion of NM ( r = 0.64 , p < 0.0001) , MN ( r = 0.49 , p = 0.002) , combined MN and NM ( r = 0.75 , p < 0,0001) and eventually plasma free levels of NM ( r = 0.55 p = 0.006). In mutated-patients ( 3 SDHD , 2 SDHB , 3 NF1 , 1 VHL and 3 RET) , a similar correlation was observed between the MB and the 24h-urinary combined MN and NM ( r = 0.86 , p = 0.0012). For the first time , we demonstrate a positive correlation between the PHEO-to-liver SUVmax ratio and the mean number of secretory granule fusion events of the corresponding PHEO cells revealed by amperometric spikes ( p = 0.01). While the 18F-FDOPA PET/CT metabolic burden of PHEO strongly correlates with the concentration of metanephrines , amperometric recordings suggest that the 18F-FDOPA uptake could be enhanced by the overactivity of the catecholamines exocytosis. <br>.
