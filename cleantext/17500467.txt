  The weighted CT dose index ( CTDI The CTDIfreeair , for multiple nTs up to 160 mm , was calculated from ( 1) high-resolution air kerma profiles from a step-and-shoot translation of a liquid ionization chamber ( LIC) ( considered to be a dosimetric reference) , ( 2) pencil ionization chamber ( PIC) measurements at multiple contiguous positions , and ( 3) air kerma profiles obtained through the continuous translation of a solid-state detector. The resulting CTDIfreeair was used to calculate the CTDI The LIC indicated that a 40 mm nT should not be excluded from the extension of the CTDI The CTDI
