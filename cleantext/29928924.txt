  Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS) is common and sometimes complicated by nasal polyps ( NP). Corticosteroid nasal sprays are often unsatisfactory because they are ineffective at delivering medication to high/deep sites of inflammation<symptom>. Assess whether an exhalation delivery system with fluticasone ( EDS-FLU) , capable of high/deep drug deposition , improves outcomes. Patients ( N = 323) ≥ 18 years with moderate-to-severe congestion<symptom> and NP were randomized to twice-daily EDS-FLU ( 93 , 186 , or 372μg) or EDS-placebo for 24 weeks ( 16 double-blind ( DB) plus 8 open-label ( OL) when all received 372μg). Coprimary endpoints were change in nasal congestion/obstruction at 4 weeks and summed bilateral polyp grade at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included symptoms , polyp elimination , and functioning. EDS-FLU was superior on both co-primary endpoints ( P < .001 vs EDS-placebo , all doses). Mean polyp grade improved continuously through week 24 ( P < .009 , all comparisons) , with polyps eliminated on at least 1 side in ∼ 25 % of patients at week 24 vs 8.7 % with EDS-placebo ( P ≤ 0.014 , all comparisons). Sino-nasal Outcomes Test ( SNOT-22) scores also improved significantly versus EDS-placebo ( -21.1 to -21.4 vs. -11.7 at week 16; P < 0.05 all doses). At the end of DB , EDS-FLU ( all doses) significantly improved all 4 defining disease symptoms. Most EDS-FLU patients ( 68 %) reported `` much '' or `` very much '' improvement. The number of patients eligible for surgery decreased 62 % -67 %. The safety profile was similar to that reported in prior trials evaluating conventional corticosteroid nasal sprays in comparable populations. EDS-FLU produces clinically and statistically significant improvement in all 4 diagnostically defining disease symptoms , polyp grade , and quality of life in CRSwNP.
