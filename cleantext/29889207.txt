  FM dyes are used to study the synaptic vesicle ( SV) cycle. These amphipathic probes have a hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail , making them water-soluble with the ability to reversibly enter and exit membrane lipid bilayers. These styryl dyes are relatively non-fluorescent in aqueous medium , but insertion into the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane causes a > 40X increase in fluorescence. In neuronal synapses , FM dyes are internalized during SV endocytosis , trafficked both within and between SV pools , and released with SV exocytosis , providing a powerful tool to visualize presynaptic stages of neurotransmission. A primary genetic model of glutamatergic synapse development and function is the Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ) , where FM dye imaging has been used extensively to quantify SV dynamics in a wide range of mutant conditions. The NMJ synaptic terminal is easily accessible , with a beautiful array of large synaptic boutons ideal for imaging applications. Here , we compare and contrast the three ways to stimulate the Drosophila NMJ to drive activity-dependent FM1-43 dye uptake/release: 1) bath application of high ( K
