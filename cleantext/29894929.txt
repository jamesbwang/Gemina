  Antibiotics and hormones are among the most concerning trace contaminants in the environment. Therefore , the present work aimed to identify anaerobic microorganisms with the ability to remove pharmaceutical products ( PhPs) belonging to these two classes ( ciprofloxacin , 17β-estradiol and sulfamethoxazole) under different anaerobic conditions , and to elucidate the bio-removal mechanisms involved. Ciprofloxacin was efficiently biodegraded under both nitrate- and sulfate-reducing conditions reaching a PhP removal superior to 80 % , whereas 17β-estradiol was only biodegraded under nitrate-reducing conditions reaching a removal of 84 %. No biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole was observed. In nitrate-reducing conditions the ciprofloxacin-degrading community was composed of Comamonas , Arcobacter<pathogen> , Dysgonomonas , Macellibacteroides and Actinomyces<pathogen> , genera while Comamonas and Castellaniella were the main bacteria present in the 17β-estradiol-degrading community. In sulfate-reducing conditions the community was mainly composed by bacteria affiliated to Desulfovibrio , Enterococcus<pathogen> and Peptostreeptococcus. Interestingly , the PhP under study were biodegraded even in the absence of additional carbon source , with 85 % of ciprofloxacin removed under sulfate-reducing conditions and 62 % and 83 % of ciprofloxacin and estradiol removed , respectively , under nitrate-reducing conditions. This work provides new insights into anaerobic bioremediation of PhP and novel PhP-degrading bacteria.
