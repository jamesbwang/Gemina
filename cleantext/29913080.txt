  Post-glacial origins of Woodland caribou ( Rangifer tarandus ssp) on the island<disease> of Newfoundland and their relationship to mainland populations have been uncertain. Sequence analysis of 2,223 bp of the mitochondrial DNA Control Region and Cytochrome b gene from 233 Newfoundland caribou identified 32 haplotypes in four major clades. Comparison with other Nearctic caribou confirms a closer affinity of the basal Clade A with animals from the mainland , and as an outgroup to Clades B , C , & D that are endemic to the island<disease>. This indicates re-entry of caribou to post-glacial Newfoundland across the Strait of Belle Isle from Labrador , rather than from southern coastal refugia. Newfoundland caribou are a distinct subspecies , Rangifer tarandus terranovae ( Bangs , 1896). Hierarchical AMOVA shows significant clinal differentiation of the major clades from northwest to southeast across the island<disease>. The isolated Avalon peninsula population in the extreme southeast is genetically depauperate. Founder effects are evident in herds introduced to previously unoccupied areas by wildlife managers over the past 40 ~ 50 years. Reindeer introduced in the early 20th century have not contributed to mtDNA diversity in Newfoundland caribou.
