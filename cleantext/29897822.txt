  Weight<symptom> loss<symptom> from exercise is often less than expected. Putative compensatory mechanisms may limit exercise-induced reductions in body fat and might be proportional to exercise energy expenditure. To determine compensation ( difference between accumulated exercise energy expenditure and changes in body tissue energy stores) and compensatory responses to 1500 or 3000 kcal/week of exercise energy expenditure. Overweight to obese ( n = 36) sedentary men and women were randomized to groups expending 300 or 600 kcal/exercise session , 5 days/week , for 12 weeks. 14 participants in the 300 kcal group and 15 in the 600 kcal group completed the study. The primary outcome was energy compensation assessed through changes in body tissue energy stores. Secondary outcomes were putative compensatory responses of resting metabolic rate ( RMR) , food reinforcement , dietary intake , and serum acylated ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1). All measures were determined pre- and post-training. The 3000 kcal/week group decreased ( < 0.01) percentage and kg body fat while the 1500 kcal/week group did not. The 1500 and 3000 kcal/week groups compensated 943 ( -164 to 2050) and 1007 ( 32 to 1982) kcal/week ( mean , 95 % CI , P > 0.93) , or 62.9 % and 33.6 % of exercise energy expenditure , respectively. RMR and energy intake did not change. Food reinforcement and GLP-1 decreased ( P < 0.02) , while acylated ghrelin increased ( P < 0.02). Compensation is not proportional to exercise energy expenditure. Similar energy compensation occurred in response to1500 kcal/week and 3000 kcal/week of exercise energy expenditure. Exercise energy expenditure of 3000 kcal/week is great enough to exceed compensatory responses and reduce fat mass.
