  To evaluate the effectiveness of circular keratotomy combined with wedge resection for the management of high astigmatism after penetrating keratoplasty ( PK). The study included seven eyes of seven patients with previous PK who underwent circular keratotomy combined with wedge resection. The uncorrected visual acuity ( UCVA) and best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA) , spherical equivalent ( SE) refraction , and keratometric powers obtained by corneal topography were evaluated. The power vector method was used to analyze the astigmatic change postoperatively. The mean follow-up period was 18.42 ± 8.56 months ( range 12-33 months). Uncorrected visual acuity , BCVA , and SE were improved in all eyes postoperatively. The mean preoperative astigmatism reduced from 15.11 ± 5.48 D ( range , 10.0-24.4 D) to 4.98 ± 3.01 D ( range , 2.2-9.6 D) , postoperatively. According to the vector analysis , the overall mean surgically induced astigmatism at last visit was 12.87 ± 6.20 D. The most common complication was the loosening of sutures occurred in five eyes within 2 months. Circular keratotomy combined with corneal wedge resection is a favorable option for the management of high astigmatism after PK.
