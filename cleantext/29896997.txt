  We assessed the quantity , quality and trends of randomized controlled trials comparing hand surgical interventions. Study characteristics were collected for 125 randomized controlled trials comparing hand surgical interventions. The Jadad scale ( 0-5) , which assesses methodological quality of trials , was calculated. Logistic regressions were conducted to determine associations with the Jadad score. The studies were published between 1981 and 2015 , with an increase over time , most often in Journal of Hand Surgery ( European). Mean study size was 68 patients. Mean Jadad score was 2.1 , without improvement over time. Thirty percent conducted a power analysis and 8 % an intention-to-treat analysis. Studies conducted in the United Kingdom and with smaller sample sizes , power analysis and intention-to-treat analysis were associated with a higher Jadad score. The quantity of trials has increased over time while methodological quality has remained low , indicating a need to improve quality of trials in hand surgery literature.
