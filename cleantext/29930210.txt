  We report a rare case of an unruptured cerebral aneurysm<disease> in the left distal middle cerebral artery ( MCA). A 76-year-old woman was referred to our department for unruptured cerebral aneurysms<disease> detected incidentally by magnetic resonance angiography. A left carotid angiogram revealed a saccular aneurysm<disease> arising in an arterial trunk unrelated to the branching zone of the distal MCA. The patient underwent an operation for trapping and excision of the saccular aneurysm<disease> in the distal MCA followed by end-to-end anastomosis. Histological analysis revealed an aneurysmally-dilated artery exhibiting thickened fibrous intima with foci of calcification and fragmented internal elastic lamina. Neither dissection nor infection were observed. The histological findings suggested that the aneurysm<disease> in this case was associated with arteriosclerotic change. Considering the medical history of the patient , we conclude that aging and hypertension are factors of the development of the cerebral aneurysm<disease> in our case , although the aneurysm<disease> is located in the distal MCA in which it is considered to low hemodynamic stress. We report this extremely rare case with a literature review.
