  Lewis basic substrates , such as vinylphosphines and enamines , can be problematic for transition-metal catalysed hydrofunctionalization reactions due to their propensity to ligate and deactivate transition-metal catalysts as well as form direct Lewis adducts with reaction partners. While exploring rhodium-catalyzed hydroboration of diphenylvinylphosphine with pinacolborane , we found that a high degree of regiocontrol could be achieved without the need to diminish the Lewis basicity of the phosphine by oxidation or prior-protection. At slightly elevated temperature , a high yield of the previously unreported branched regioisomer , 1-pinacolatoborono-1-diphenylphosphinoethane , was achieved with regioselectivity greater than 10: 1 using ( Rh ( COD) Cl) 2 as the catalyst and AgOTf as a catalytic additive. Inversion of regioselectivity occurred at low temperature and high yield of the linear regioisomer was observed. Subsequent functionalization of the new branched phosphine-boronic ester and its coordination to rhodium were also investigated.
