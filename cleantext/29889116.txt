  The aim of this study was to determine changes in clinical and biomechanical measures of spasticity after administering galvanic vestibular stimulation in patients with a complete spinal cord injury ( SCI). The spasticity in the lower limbs was assessed using the Modified Ashworth Scale and the pendulum test in seven SCI patients ( grade A on the ASIA Impairment Scale) before ( 0) , immediately after ( 0) , and at 5 and 30 min after the real versus sham galvanic vestibular stimulation ( 15 s each , anode over the right mastoid). Overall , the changes in spasticity were not significantly different between the real and sham galvanic vestibular stimulation. However , the Modified Ashworth Scale and the pendulum test indicated a reduction in spasticity in two out of seven patients. The results suggest that galvanic vestibular stimulation may modify spasticity in some patients with complete SCI , presumably through the residual vestibulospinal influences. Future studies should determine clinical and neurophysiological profiles of responders versus nonresponders and optimize parameters of galvanic vestibular stimulation.
