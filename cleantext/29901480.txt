  A 23-year-old woman with injury-induced acetabular dysplasia developed subacute recurrent dislocation of the right hip following closed reduction of a traumatic dislocation. The initial dislocation had been associated with small posterior wall and femoral head fractures. The recurrent dislocation was addressed with an acute periacetabular osteotomy ( PAO) for hip stabilization and femoral head fragment excision. An acute PAO is an unusual yet viable treatment strategy for addressing recurrent dislocation following traumatic fracture-dislocation in patients with posterior wall deficiency and injury-induced hip dysplasia. In the patient described herein , the procedure resulted in early stability , but she developed posttraumatic osteoarthritis at 1 year and 4 months after the injury.
