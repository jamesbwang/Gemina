  The growing number of older adults is changing the demographic landscape. Occupational therapy can better serve the older adult population by helping them maintain their functional ability , which is the ability to engage in occupations. This special issue includes both studies of interventions to evaluate and support functional ability in community-dwelling older adults and systematic reviews of such studies. This editorial highlights the six systematic reviews , which were completed in collaboration with the American Occupational Therapy Association 's Evidence-Based Practice Project. These reviews compile evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice to promote occupational performance in community-dwelling older adults. The distinct value of occupational therapy in supporting the functional ability of community-dwelling older adults with stable or declining health is discussed using the World Health Organization 's framework for healthy aging.
