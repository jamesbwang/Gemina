  Both synthetic and bioprosthetic meshes play important roles in surgical procedures such as ventral hernia repair. Although sometimes used interchangeably , these devices have inherently different properties. We therefore sought to better understand how these materials interact with the host environment to optimize surgical techniques and to improve outcomes. Synthetic mesh ( polypropylene , Prolene) or bioprosthetic mesh ( acellular fetal/neonatal bovine dermis , SurgiMend) was implanted intraperitoneally into rats lateral to a ventral incision in a novel intra-abdominal implant model. Two variables were modified with each material: ( 1) tight or loose tissue apposition , altered by modifying suture placement; and ( 2) abdominal wall injury , altered by selective abrasion of the peritoneal lining. After 5 weeks , the meshes and abdominal wall were evaluated grossly and histologically. The analysis focused on the degree of inflammatory response , neovascularization , and mesh adherence to the surrounding tissues. Synthetic mesh adhered to the abdominal wall and visceral organs , regardless of the degree of apposition or tissue injury , due to a foreign body-mediated inflammatory reaction. In areas of noninjured peritoneal lining , SurgiMend was adherent peri-suture. Neovascularization entered the mesh from these apposition points and spread outward. In areas of denuded peritoneal lining , the adherent and vascularized areas were significantly greater and not merely coincident with suture placement. The inflammatory and wound<disease> healing responses with bioprosthetic mesh seem fundamentally different from synthetic mesh. Understanding these differences may lead to varied outcomes in adherence and vascularization of the materials , and ultimately the efficacy of hernia repair. Additionally , these differences highlight the need for further basic research to optimize mesh selection for surgical technique.
