  In England and Wales , replacement of childhood 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV7) with a 13-valent vaccine ( PCV13) in 2010 was associated with a significant reduction in PCV13-serotype invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD) , with a small increase in IPD due to non-vaccine serotypes. Here , we describe the clinical presentation , comorbidity prevalence , serotype distribution and outcomes of childhood IPD during the first 6 years after PCV13 introduction. Public Health England conducts enhanced IPD surveillance in England and Wales , with detailed information requested from general practitioners for all cases in children < 5 years of age. Invasive isolates are routinely serotyped at the Public Health England reference laboratory. From April 2010 to March 2016 , 1280 IPD episodes were confirmed in 1255 children 3-59 months of age; 84.3 % ( 1059/1255) isolates were serotyped. Clinical presentation with meningitis<disease> was most prevalent in 3- to 11-month olds ( 45.8 % , 209/456) and lower respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infection<disease> in 24- to 59-month olds ( 46.7 % , 133/285). Overall , 259 ( 20.6 %) children had 292 comorbidities , particularly immunosuppression ( 31.6 % , 92/292). Twenty-one children ( 1.8 %) had recurrent IPD. The case fatality rate was 5.1 % ( 64/1255; 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 3.9 % -6.5 %) and independently associated with meningitis<disease> ( aOR 3.53; 95 % CI: 1.62-7.70) and presence of comorbidity ( aOR , 2.41; 95 % CI: 1.25-4.64). In 2015/2016 , PCV13 serotypes were responsible for 10.8 % ( 25/232) of serotyped cases; the most prevalent non-PCV13 serotypes were 12F ( 18 %) , 10A ( 12 %) , 23B ( 10 %) , 33F ( 10 %) , 15B/C ( 10 %) and 8 ( 8 %). Most childhood IPD cases are now due to non-PCV13 serotypes. A higher proportion of children with IPD have underlying comorbidity , but , reassuringly , the risk of recurrent IPD or death remains low.
