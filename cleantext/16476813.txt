  Cerebral small-vessel disease ( SVD) represents the most frequent type of vascular brain lesions<symptom> , often coexisting with Alzheimer disease ( AD). By quantifying white matter hyperintensities ( WMH) and hippocampal and parietal atrophy , we aimed to describe the prevalence and severity of SVD among older adults with normal cognition ( NC) , mild cognitive impairment ( MCI) , and probable AD and to describe associated risk factors. This study included 105 older adults evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging and clinical and neuropsychological tests. We used the Fazekas scale ( FS) for quantification of WMH , the Scheltens scale ( SS) for hippocampal atrophy , and the Koedam scale ( KS) for parietal atrophy. Logistic regression models were performed to determine the association between FS , SS , and KS scores and the presence of NC , MCI , or probable AD. Compared to NC subjects , SVD was more prevalent in MCI and probable AD subjects. After adjusting for confounding factors , logistic regression showed a positive association between higher scores on the FS and probable AD ( OR = 7.6 , 95 % CI 2.7-20 , These results suggest an association between severity of vascular brain lesions<symptom> and neurodegeneration.
