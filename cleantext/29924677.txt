  Since its introduction , the placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG) has been increasing in the Western countries. Nevertheless , it is not always possible to perform this operation. Laparoscopic-assisted endoscopic gastrostomy ( LAPEG) is an effective alternative solution. Indication to PEG placement was established only for people who required a nutritional support of > 4 weeks and without metastatic carcinoma. Sixteen patients underwent LAPEG after the failure of the original PEG operation. Two trocars of 5 mm and one of 12 mm were used , and a fourth trocar of 5 mm was placed when necessary to lift the liver. In four cases a gastrotomy was performed , in seven patients it was not necessary. When PEG was placed , the stomach was not fixed with stitches to the abdominal wall. Sixteen patients were selected for LAPEG and were all successful; in one case it was necessary to replace the PEG , and the same procedure was performed again. Median age was 73 years. Placement of laparoscopic PEG was not associated with other surgical procedures. Nutritional feeding started the day after for patients with sutureless technique and 2 days after in patients with gastrotomy. LAPEG is a safe technique with a low complication rate. It should be considered a minimal alternative in all cases where the placement of PEG is not possible.
