  Chest radiographs are obtained as a standard part of clinical care. Rapid advancements in medical technology have resulted in a myriad of new medical devices , and familiarity with their imaging appearance is a critical yet increasingly difficult endeavor. Many modern thoracic medical devices are new renditions of old designs and are often smaller than older versions. In addition , multiple device designs serving the same purpose may have varying morphologies and positions within the chest. The radiologist must be able to recognize and correctly identify the proper positioning of state-of-the-art medical devices and identify any potential complications that could impact patient care and management. To familiarize radiologists with the arsenal of newer thoracic medical devices , this review describes the indications , radiologic appearance , complications , and magnetic resonance imaging safety of each device.
