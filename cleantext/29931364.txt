  Muscimol is a gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist that selectively and temporarily inhibits neurons. Local bolus injection of muscimol has been used experimentally to inhibit neuronal populations within discrete anatomical structures and discern their physiological function. To determine the safety and behavioral effects of convection-enhanced delivery of muscimol into the bilateral subthalamic nuclei ( STN) of nonhuman primate rhesus macaques ( NHPs). Six awake NHPs underwent co-infusion of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid ( Gd-DTPA) , a surrogate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) tracer , with increasing concentrations of muscimol for behavioral and histological assessment. Three other NHPs were co-infused with Gd-DTPA and 3H-muscimol into the STN to determine muscimol distribution by MRI and autoradiography. Two NHPs underwent microcatheter implantation without muscimol infusion for control comparison. MRI revealed selective and complete perfusion of the bilateral STN in animals infused with Gd-DTPA and muscimol. No abnormal<symptom> movements<symptom> occurred at 0.125 mM. Muscimol doses between 0.25 and 4.4 mM resulted in transient , dose-dependent hyperkinesia. Muscimol ( 8.8 mM) resulted in severe bilateral dyskinesias , ballistic movements , and sedation. An 88.8 mM dose produced unresponsiveness in 1 animal. Infusion-related pathological abnormities or toxicity was not present on histological examination. MRI distribution of co-infused Gd-DTPA was similar to autoradiographic distribution of 3H-muscimol ( Vd; R = 0.94). Mean Vd of infused animals was 37.9 mm3 ± 11.7 mm3 and mean Vd: Vi 7.6 ± 2.3. Bilateral convection-enhanced delivery of muscimol into the primate STN resulted in dose-related hyperkinetic movements that resolved after stopping the infusion. Muscimol was not toxic to brain tissue. Gd-DTPA accurately tracked muscimol distribution.
