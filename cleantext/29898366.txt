  The notorious lithium ( Li) dendrites and the low Coulombic efficiency ( CE) of Li anode are two major obstacles to the practical utilization of Li metal batteries ( LMBs). Introducing a dendrite-suppressing additive into nonaqueous electrolytes is one of the facile and effective solutions to promote the commercialization of LMBs. Herein , Li difluorophosphate ( LiPO
