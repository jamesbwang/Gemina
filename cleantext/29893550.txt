  Comprehensive metabolomic data can be achieved using multiple orthogonal separation and mass spectrometry ( MS) analytical techniques. However , drawing biologically relevant conclusions from this data and combining it with additional layers of information collected by other omic technologies present a significant bioinformatic challenge. To address this , a data processing approach was designed to automate the comprehensive prediction of dysregulated metabolic pathways/networks from multiple data sources. The platform autonomously integrates multiple MS-based metabolomics data types without constraints due to different sample preparation/extraction , chromatographic separation , or MS detection method. This multimodal analysis streamlines the extraction of biological information from the metabolomics data as well as the contextualization within proteomics and transcriptomics data sets. As a proof of concept , this multimodal analysis approach was applied to a colorectal cancer ( CRC) study , in which complementary liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ( LC-MS) data were combined with proteomic and transcriptomic data. Our approach provided a highly resolved overview of colon cancer metabolic dysregulation , with an average 17 % increase of detected dysregulated metabolites per pathway and an increase in metabolic pathway prediction confidence. Moreover , 95 % of the altered metabolic pathways matched with the dysregulated genes and proteins , providing additional validation at a systems level. The analysis platform is currently available via the XCMS Online ( XCMSOnline.scripps.edu).
