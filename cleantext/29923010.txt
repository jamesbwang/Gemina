  Oxidative kidney injury was compared in newborn and adult rats under conditions of ischemia/reperfusion and in experimental model of systemic inflammation<symptom> induced by endotoxin ( LPS of bacterial cell wall) administration. Oxidative stress in the kidney accompanied both experimental models , but despite similar oxidative tissue damage , kidney dysfunction in neonates was less pronounced than in adult animals. It was found that neonatal kidney has a more potent regenerative potential with higher level of cell proliferation than adult kidney , where the level proliferating cell antigen ( PCNA) increased only on day 2 after ischemia/reperfusion. The pathological process in the neonatal kidney developed against the background of active cell proliferation , and , as a result , proliferating cells could almost immediately replace the damaged structures. In the adult kidney , regeneration of the renal tissue was activated only after significant loss of functional nephrons and impairment of renal function.
