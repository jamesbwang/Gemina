  The risk of malaria<disease> infection displays spatial and temporal variability that is likely due to interaction between the physical environment and the human population. In this study , we performed a spatial analysis at three different time points , corresponding to three cross-sectional surveys conducted as part of an insecticide-treated bed nets efficacy study , to reveal patterns of malaria<disease> incidence distribution in an area of Northern Guatemala characterized by low malaria<disease> endemicity. A thorough understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of malaria<disease> distribution is essential for targeted malaria<disease> control programs. Two methods , the local Moran 's I and the Getis-Ord G
