  Scald injuries caused by hair braiding have become increasingly common in our pediatric burn center 's African-American population. This injury mechanism has received little attention in the medical literature. To guide prevention , the present study aims to characterize this novel mechanism of injury and identify patterns underlying its frequency. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed on all cases of scald injury due to hair braiding in African-American girls treated at our burn center from 2000 to 2016. Data were gathered from the patient 's medical records to determine demographics , details of the injury , and treatment rendered. Patterns of injury frequency were identified and statistically analyzed. Thirty-four patients suffered scald injuries associated with hair braiding. The mean patient age was 8.4 years ( SD Â± 5 years). The majority of injuries ( 90 %) occurred in the home. The frequency of injuries significantly increased starting in the year 2012 , rising from less than 3 % to more than 10 % of evaluated injuries in African-American girls ( P = .0015). Injuries were significantly more frequent in summer months. Injuries resulted in considerable usage of medical resources , including ambulance transport , hospital admission , clinic visits , prolonged wound<disease> care , and surgery. Complications developed in 41 % of injured children; the most frequent complication was scarring. Pediatric scald injuries caused by braiding practices are morbid , have recently become increasingly frequent , tend to occur in the summer , and may be related to a new do-it-yourself style trend among African-American girls.
