  Histone deacetylases ( HDACs) represent a family of enzymes that are targets for epigenetic modulation of genomic activity and may be beneficial in the treatment of many diseases , including cancer and central nervous system disorders. In animal models , HDAC inhibitors have neuroprotective , antiepileptogenic , and antidepressant effects. Assaying HDAC activity provides a robust method for identifying HDAC inhibitors and for assessing their effects under various physiological conditions or after pathological insults. In this unit , a simple and sensitive assay for measuring HDAC activity is described. HDAC activity in tissue lysates can be assessed fluorometrically using a Boc-Lys ( Ac) HDAC activity kit. HDACs catalyze the deacetylation of the substrate Boc-Lys ( Ac)- AMC. Addition of a trypsin-containing developer converts the deacetylated product to a quantifiable fluorophore that can be used both as a screening method to identify putative HDAC inhibitors and to assess the effects of these inhibitors on tissue and animal epigenetic-modulated phenotypes.
