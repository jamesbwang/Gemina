  microRNAs ( miRNAs) are important regulators in the development and progression of human gastric cancer ( GC). However , the expression and biological function of miR-449c in GC remains unknown. In the present study , miR-449c was demonstrated to be downregulated in GC tissues and cell lines compared with normal. Decreased miR-449c levels were associated with poor prognosis in GC patients. Overexpression of miR-449c inhibited migration and invasion in SGC-7901 cells , while inhibition of miR-449c enhanced migration and invasion in MGC-803 cells. Furthermore , 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase ( PFKFB3) was identified to be a downstream target of miR-449c in GC cells. miR-449c directly regulated the expression of PFKFB3 in GC cells. Overexpression of PFKFB3 abrogated the inhibitory effect of miR-449c on the migration and invasion of GC cells. In conclusion , the present study suggests that miR-449c may be a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target in GC.
