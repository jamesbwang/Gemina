  Biliary tract cancer , carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts , carcinoma of the gall bladder , ampullary carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are often identified at an advanced stage and have poor prognoses. Although effective chemotherapy regimens are needed , their development remains unsatisfactory. From the results of a phase III clinical trial ( ABC-02 trial) , gemcitabine plus cisplatin is the standard first-line chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced biliary tract cancer. A phase III trial of gemcitabine plus cisplatin vs. gemcitabine plus S-1 therapy ( FUGA-BT) demonstrated the non-inferiority of gemcitabine plus S-1 to gemcitabine plus cisplatin. A phase III trial of gemcitabine plus cisplatin vs. gemcitabine plus cisplatin plus S-1 ( MITSUBA) was conducted , and the report on the results of the final analysis is being awaited. A standard second-line chemotherapeutic regimen has not yet been established. Fluoropyrimidines are frequently used in clinical practice. Despite many clinical trials being conducted with molecular targeted agents including erlotinib , cetuximab , panitumumab , bevacizumab , sorafenib , cediranib , trametinib and vandetanib , no agent has shown to be effective for advanced biliary tract cancer. Next-generation sequencing shows great promise by allowing rapid mutational analysis of multiple genes in human cancers , and attractive driver genetic alterations have been reported in biliary tract cancer. FGFR2 fusion gene , mutations of IDH1/2 , BRAF , BRCA1/2 , ATM , PIK3CA and overexpression of c-MET and HER2/neu are reported relatively frequently and are interesting targets. Therefore , future development in precision medicine utilizing next-generation sequencing is expected. Although the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors , such as anti-PD-1 , anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies , remains unknown at present , basic data and results of ongoing clinical trials are anticipated.
