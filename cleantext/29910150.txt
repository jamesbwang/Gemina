  In injured tissues , regeneration is often associated with cell fate plasticity , in that cells deviate from their normal lineage paths. It is becoming increasingly clear that this plasticity often creates alternative strategies to restore damaged or lost cells. Alternatively , cell fate plasticity is also part and parcel of pathologic tissue transformations that accompany disease. In this Perspective , we summarize a few illustrative examples of physiologic and aberrant cellular plasticity. Then , we speculate on how one could enhance endogenous plasticity to promote regeneration and reverse pathologic plasticity , perhaps inspiring interest in a new class of therapies targeting cell fate modulation.
