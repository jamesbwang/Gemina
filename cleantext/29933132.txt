  The knowledge on the mode of action , biocompatibility and ecological tolerance of silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs) is gradually accumulating over the years with contradictory findings. Most of the studies indicated the toxic impact of AgNPs on plant growth and development , where induction of oxidative stress was considered to be one of the causal factors. The present study demonstrates the phytostimulatory effect of bio-synthesized silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs) during seed germination and seedling growth of rice ( Oryza sativa L. , cv. Swarna) under in vitro condition. All the tested concentrations of AgNPs ( 10 , 20 , 40 ppm) promote both the shoot and root growth which was evident from the increased length and biomass of the seedlings. Exposure to AgNPs also significantly increased the chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents. The content and the pattern of distribution of phenolic metabolites among the different treatments are indicative of non-toxic impact of AgNP mimicking mild or no stress to the seedlings. Growth stimulation of rice seedlings by AgNPs was further supported by a low level of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) concomitant with decreased amount of lipid peroxidation and H
