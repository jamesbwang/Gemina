  The goal of this study was to evaluate the stress distribution in a tooth/restoration system according to the factors `` amount of dental remnant '' ( 3 levels) and `` restorative material '' ( 2 levels). Three endodontically treated maxillary molars were modeled with CAD software for conducting non-linear finite element analysis ( FEA) , each with a determined amount of dental remnant of 1.5 , 3 , or 4.5 mm. Models were duplicated , and half received restorations in lithium disilicate ( IPS e.max CAD) , while the other half received leucite ceramic restorations ( IPS Empress CAD) , both from Ivoclar Vivadent ( Schaan , Liechtenstein). The solids were imported to analysis software ( ANSYS 17.2 , ANSYS Inc. , Houston , TX , USA) in STEP format. All contacts involving the resin cement were considered no-separation , whereas between teeth and fixation cylinder , the contact was considered perfectly bonded. The mechanical properties of each structure were reported , and the materials were considered isotropic , linearly elastic , and homogeneous. An axial load ( 300N) was applied at the occlusal surface ( triploidism area). Results were determined by colorimetric graphs of maximum principal stress ( MPS) on tooth remnant , cement line , and restoration. MPS revealed that both factors influenced the stress distribution for all structures; the higher the material 's elastic modulus , the higher the stress concentration on the restoration and the lower the stress concentration on the cement line. Moreover , the greater the dental crown remnant , the higher the stress concentration on the restoration. Thus , the remaining dental tissue should always be preserved. In situations in which few dental remnants are available , the thicker the restoration , the higher the concentration of stresses in its structure , protecting the adhesive interface from potential adhesive failures. Results are more promising when the endocrown is fabricated with lithium disilicate ceramic.
