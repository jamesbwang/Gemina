  In the field of nanomechanics , parametric excitations are of interest since they can greatly enhance sensing capabilities and eliminate cross-talk. Above a certain threshold of the parametric pump , the mechanical resonator can be brought into parametric resonance. Here we demonstrate parametric resonance of suspended single-layer graphene membranes<symptom> by an efficient opto-thermal drive that modulates the intrinsic spring constant. With a large amplitude of the optical drive , a record number of 14 mechanical modes can be brought into parametric resonance by modulating a single parameter: the pre-tension. A detailed analysis of the parametric resonance allows us to study nonlinear dynamics and the loss tangent of graphene resonators. It is found that nonlinear damping , of the van der Pol type , is essential to describe the high amplitude parametric resonance response in atomically thin
