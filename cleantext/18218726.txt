  Puberty onset is a milestone in sexual development. A tumor suppress gene ( TSG) network had been reported to be involved in the regulation of female puberty onset. The observations in rodents and primates showed a potential link between microRNAs and puberty onset. To figure out what miRNAs play roles in this important biological process , profilings of microRNAs in the hypothalamus of female mice from three different pubertal stages , juvenile ( postnatal day ( P10)) , early pubertal ( P25) and pubertal ( P30) were performed on the Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 3.0 Arrays , the cerebral cortex ( CTX) was used as a control tissue. 20 miRNAs were shown to be differentially expressed in hypothalamus ( fold change > 1.5 , P < 0.05) , but not in CTX during the transition from juvenile to pubertal. Four of them were validated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR ( qRT-PCR) method. 1018 genes were predicted as the targets of these miRNAs. Further bioinformatics analysis suggested that these target genes were involved in many important signaling pathways , especially in the cancer related pathways. We also found that about 90 % of these target genes were expressed in the hypothalamus , as well as in the immortalized GnRH-producing GT1-7 cells , which provided additional evidence that these miRNAs could be female puberty onset related. Here we present a novel comprehensive data set of miRNA gene expression during the puberty onset; and it provides an important recourse for the future functional characterization of individual miRNAs and their targets in mouse hypothalamus and in GT1-7 cells.
