  ARL11 is a tumor suppressor gene with established pro-apoptotic properties , but its function beyond this role is poorly understood. A new analysis of macrophage activation has identified ARL11 as a novel regulator of a mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK). These findings expand on the function of ARL11 beyond its tumor suppressor activity and highlight a novel role as a regulator of macrophage activation and inflammatory response.
