  Thyroid hormones ( THs) influence multiple processes in the developing and adult central nervous system , and their local availability needs to be maintained at levels that are tailored to the requirements of their biological targets. The local complement of TH transporters , deiodinase enzymes , and receptors is critical to ensure specific levels of TH action in neural cells. The type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase ( DIO3) inactivates THs and is highly present in the developing and adult brain , where it limits their availability and action. DIO3 deficiency in mice results in a host of neurodevelopmental and behavioral abnormalities , demonstrating the deleterious effects of TH excess , and revealing the critical role of DIO3 in the regulation of TH action in the brain. The fact the
