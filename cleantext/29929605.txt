  Chronic pruritus is a common condition that has a detrimental impact on quality of life. As the molecular pathogenesis of itch is elucidated , novel therapies that disrupt itch pathways are being investigated. Emerging treatments include drugs targeting the neural system , drugs targeting the immune system , antihistamines , bile acid transport inhibitors , and topical drugs that work through a variety of mechanisms such as phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition or targeting of nerve ion channels. Many of these therapies show promising results in the treatment of chronic itch of various etiologies , such as atopic dermatitis<disease> , psoriasis , uremic pruritus , and cholestatic pruritus.
