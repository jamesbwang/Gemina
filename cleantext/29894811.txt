  Health information exchanges ( HIEs) are multisided platforms that facilitate the sharing of patient health information ( PHI) between providers and payers across organizations within a region , community or hospital system. The benefits of HIEs to payers and providers include lower cost , faster services , and better health outcome. However , most HIEs have configured the patient healthcare consent process to give all providers who sign up with the exchange access to PHI for all consenting patients , leaving no control to patients in customized what information to share and with who. This research investigates the impact of granting greater control to patients in sharing their personal health information on consent rates and making them active participants in the HIEs system. This research utilizes a randomized experimental survey design study. The study uses responses from 388 participants and structural equation modeling ( SEM) to test the conceptual model. The main findings of this research include that patients consent rate increases significantly when greater control in sharing PHI is offered to the patient. In addition , greater control reduces the negative impact of privacy concern on the intention to consent. Similarly , trust in healthcare professionals leads to higher consent when greater control is offered to the patient. Thus , greater control empowers the role of trust in engaging patients and sustaining HIEs. The paper makes a theoretical contribution to research by extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology ( UTAUT) model. The findings impact practice by providing insights that will help sustain HIEs.
