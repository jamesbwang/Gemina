  Human telomeric DNA is transcribed into telomeric RNA in cells. Telomeric RNA performs the fundamental biological functions such as regulation and protection of chromosome ends. This digest highlights the human telomere RNA G-quadruplex structures , telomere RNA functions , G-quadruplex-binding small molecules , and future prospects.
