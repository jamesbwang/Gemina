  To assess the clinical value of biomarkers to identify TAVI-patients at high risk for ad-verse outcome , to assess whether these provide prognostic information beyond that of estab-lished clinical risk scores , and to assess whether a combined multi-marker strategy can im-prove clinical decision-making. In 683 TAVI-patients , biomarkers reflecting various pathophysiologic systems were measured before TAVI. The primary endpoint was all-cause 1-year mortality. Other outcomes were recorded according to the VARC-2 criteria. 30-day and 1-year mortality were 2.9 % and 12.0 % , respectively. Non-survivors at 1 year had higher risk scores and increased median biomarker-levels. Logistic EuroSCORE in combina-tion with hs-CRP had the highest predictive value for 30-day ( AUC 0.740 ( 95 %- CI: 0.667-0.812) , p = 0.1117) and 1-year mortality ( AUC 0.631 ( 95 %- CI: 0.569-0.693) , p = 0.0403). In multivariate regression analysis , logistic EuroSCORE in combination with hs-CRP showed the strongest association with 1-year mortality. Combinations of increasing medians of logistic EuroSCORE results and hs-CRP-levels allowed the stratification of the TAVI-patient into sub-groups with 1-year mortality rates ranging from 6.6 % up to 18.2 %. Hs-CRP besides the logistic EuroSCORE was an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality in TAVI-patients. A combination of both might help to better predict procedural risk and outcome.
