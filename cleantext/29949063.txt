  There are both secretory and absorptive pathways working in tandem to support ionic movement driving fluid secretion across epithelia. The mechanisms exerting control of fluid secretion in the oviduct is yet to be fully determined. This study explored the role of apical or luminal extracellular ATP ( ATPe)- stimulated ion transport in an oviduct epithelium model , using the Ussing chamber short-circuit current ( Isc) technique. Basal Isc in oviduct epithelium in response to apical ATPe comprises both chloride secretion and sodium absorption and has distinct temporal phases. A rapid transient peak followed by a sustained small increase above baseline. Both phases of the apical ATPe Isc response are sensitive to anion ( HCO
