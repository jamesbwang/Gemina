  We investigated the correlation between eating-related pathology and the Superwoman ideal among ultra-Orthodox ( Haredi) and National-Religious women in Israel using self-figure drawings and related narratives. A sample of 55 women filled out self-report eating attitudes questionnaire ( EAT-26) , the Superwoman Ideal questionnaire , and a self-drawing followed by a narrative. No significant difference in eating pathology was found between the ultra-Orthodox and NationalReligious women. A gap was found between the selfdrawings and the narratives , which was greater among the ultra-Orthodox women. Exposed body parts were more significant than sexual signs , which are almost completely covered in these societies. There was no significant difference in the eating disorders ' level among ultra-Orthodox and NationalReligious women. The percentage of risk of developing eating problems was similar to that of the secular population. The self-drawings with narratives was found to be an effective tool for researching these societies.
