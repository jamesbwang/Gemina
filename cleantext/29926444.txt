  Here we describe novel enzymatic procedures for the production of long ( from tens of nanometers to microns) double-stranded poly ( dG)- poly ( dC) , triple-helical poly ( dG)- poly ( dG)- poly ( dC) , and quadruple-helical G4 DNA. All these molecules are uniform in size and possess improved mechanical and electrical properties with respect to a canonical random sequence double-stranded DNA. They can potentially be used as elements in nanoelectronic devices and circuits.
