  The purpose of this study is to examine the correlation between leg power and balance<symptom> performance in elite wrestlers and injury history. In the research group , there are 18 elite freestyle male wrestlers at the ages of 24.27 ± 3.18 years , with a height of 171.86 ± 5.44 cm and a body<symptom> weight of 79.27 ± 11.16 kg.
