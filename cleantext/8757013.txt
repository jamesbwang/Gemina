  In this article , we review illustrative case descriptions of both primary and secondary visual snow from our clinic. We discuss recently proposed criteria for visual snow syndrome<disease> and offer a slight modification of these criteria. We also discuss the theories on the pathophysiological mechanisms of visual snow , as well as the current approach to treatment. Visual snow is a condition where patients see constant , innumerable flickering dots throughout the visual field , similar to `` TV static. '' Though visual snow was originally described in 1995 , there were still fewer than 10 cases in the literature prior to 2014. In the last 4 years , this has grown to approximately 200 cases and there has been a concentrated effort to better understand and characterize this condition. It has become apparent that patients who see visual snow frequently have additional visual and non-visual symptoms , and the consistency of these symptoms has led to proposed criteria for visual snow syndrome<disease>. When seeing a patient with visual snow , it is important to rule out a possible underlying secondary etiology. Patients with visual snow syndrome<disease> frequently have comorbid migraine , but visual snow appears to be a separate entity from persistent migraine aura. The pathophysiology of this syndrome<disease> is not clear , but recent neurophysiologic and neuroimaging studies have helped advance our understanding.
