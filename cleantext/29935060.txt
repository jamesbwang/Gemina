  The aim of this study was to determine how the Banff antibody-mediated rejection ( ABMR) classification for kidney transplantation is interpreted in practice and affects therapy. The Banff Antibody-Mediated Injury Workgroup electronically surveyed clinicians and pathologists worldwide regarding diagnosis and treatment for 6 case-based scenarios. The participants ' ( 95 clinicians and 72 renal pathologists) assigned diagnoses were compared to the Banff intended diagnoses ( reference standard). The assigned diagnoses and reference standard differed by 26.1 % ( SD 28.1 %) for pathologists and 34.5 % ( SD 23.3 %) for clinicians. The greatest discordance between the reference standard and clinicians ' diagnosis was when histologic features of ABMR were present but donor-specific antibody was undetected ( 49.4 % ( 43/87)). For pathologists , the greatest discordance was in the case of acute/active ABMR C4d staining negative in a positive crossmatch transplant recipient ( 33.8 % ( 23/68)). Treatment approaches were heterogeneous but linked to the assigned diagnosis. When acute/active ABMR was diagnosed by the clinician , treatment was recommended 95.3 % ( SD 18.4 %) of the time vs only 77.7 % ( SD 39.2 %) of the time when chronic active ABMR was diagnosed ( P < .0001). In conclusion , the Banff ABMR classification is vulnerable to misinterpretation , which potentially has patient management implications. Continued efforts are needed to improve the understanding and standardized application of ABMR classification in the transplant community.
