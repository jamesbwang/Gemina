  Long standing vitamin D deficiency in children causes rickets with growth impairment. We investigated whether sub-ischial leg length ( SLL) is shorter , and cephalo-caudal length: length ( CCL: L) ratio and sitting height: height ( SH: H) ratio larger , with lower cord s-25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD) in the population-based prospective Odense Child Cohort , Denmark. We included healthy singletons born to term with available measures of cord 25OHD and anthropometrics up to three years ' age. Linear regression was stratified by sex a priori and adjusted for maternal ethnicity , pre-pregnancy body mass index and smoking during pregnancy , season of blood sampling and child age. Median ( IQR) cord 25OHD was 48.0 ( 34.0-62.4) nmol/L. At mean age 19.1 months , n = 504 , mean ( SD) SLL was 31.7 ( 1.7) cm; CCL: L-ratio 0.62 ( 0.01). At 36.3 months , n = 956 , mean SLL was 42.9 ( 2.0) cm; SH: H-ratio 0.56 ( 0.01). No participants had rickets. In adjusted analyses , 19-months-old boys had 0.1 cm shorter SLL ( p = 0.009) and 0.1 % higher CCL: L-ratio ( p = 0.04) with every 10 nmol/L increase in cord 25OHD. Similar findings were seen for late pregnancy 25OHD. In the highest cord 25OHD quartile ( > 60.7 nmol/L) , SLL was 0.8 cm shorter ( 95 % C.I.: 1.36; -0.29 , linear trend , p = 0.004) , and CCL: L-ratio 0.8 % higher ( 95 % C.I. 8.0x10-05; 0.01 , linear trend , p = 0.01) , compared to lowest quartile ( < 30.7 nmol/L). Similar associations with cord 25OHD were observed in 3-year-old boys. No consistent associations between 25OHD and anthropometrics were seen in girls at either age. No leg shortening was found with decreasing cord s-25OHD in a healthy population of infants. A small , yet significant inverse association between cord 25OHD and SLL in boys 1 1/2 -3 years warrants further investigations.
