  To compare the clinical outcomes of wavefront-optimized ( WFO) transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy ( trans-PRK) and corneal wavefront-guided ( CWFG) trans-PRK for myopic eyes with moderate to high astigmatism. One hundred ninety-six eyes ( 196 patients) with moderate to high astigmatism ( ≥ 1.75 D) treated with WFO or CWFG trans-PRK ( 101 and 95 eyes , respectively) were retrospectively registered. Safety , efficacy , predictability , vector analysis , and corneal aberrations were compared between groups preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively. At postoperative 6 months , the mean logMAR uncorrected distance visual acuity was similar in the WFO (- 0.07 ± 0.08) and CWFG (- 0.07 ± 0.07) groups. Safety , efficacy , and predictability of refractive and visual outcomes were also similar. The correction indices were 1.02 ± 0.14 and 1.03 ± 0.13 in the WFO and CWFG groups , respectively , with no significant difference. The absolute values of the angle of error were significantly higher in the WFO group ( 2.28 ± 2.44 vs. 1.40 ± 1.40; P = 0.002). Corneal total root mean square higher-order aberrations and corneal spherical aberrations increased postoperatively in both groups; however , the change was smaller in the CWFG group. Corneal coma<symptom> showed a significant increase postoperatively only in the WFO group. WFO and CWFG trans-PRK are safe and effective for correcting moderate to high astigmatism. However , CWFG trans-PRK provides a more predictable astigmatism correction axis and fewer induced corneal aberrations.
