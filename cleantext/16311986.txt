  Many patients with cancer use electronic cigarettes ( e-cigarettes) , yet little is known about patterns and reasons for use. Using cross-sectional baseline data from a randomized controlled trial , we aimed to describe prevalence and correlates of e-cigarette use , frequency of use , and reasons for use among smokers recently diagnosed with cancer. Participants ( n = 302) included adults ( age ≥ 18 years) recently diagnosed with varied cancer types who smoked ≥ 1 cigarette within the past 30-d from two US academic medical centers. Participants reported ever and current e-cigarette use , and current e-cigarette users reported days of e-cigarette use and the main reason for use. We compared current , former , and never e-cigarette users by sociodemographics , cancer type , medical comorbidities , smoking behaviors , attitudes , and emotional symptoms , and described use among current e-cigarette users. Of smokers recently diagnosed with cancer , 49 % ( n = 149) reported ever e-cigarette use and 19 % ( n = 56) reported current use. Of current e-cigarette users , 29 % ( n = 16) reported daily use. Current e-cigarette users did not differ from former and never e-cigarette users by cancer type , smoking behaviors , or emotional symptoms. Women were more likely to be current users than never users , and current e-cigarette users had less education than former users. Most current e-cigarette users reported using them to help quit smoking ( 75 %). One in five smokers with cancer report current e-cigarette use , but most are not using e-cigarettes daily. The majority report using e-cigarettes to quit smoking. E-cigarette use by patients with cancer appears to reflect a desire to quit smoking.
