  Lung cancer is the second most common malignant tumor and the leading cause of cancer death. Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR)- mutant non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) is a distinct subtype of lung cancer comprising approximately 15-40 % of non-squamous tumors. The development of first- and second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs) has been a significant step forward in the treatment of patients with EGFR-mutant tumors , and over the last few years has been the therapy of choice in the initial management of patients with activating mutations in EGFR , with some differences in efficacy and toxicity profile. Up to 50 % of patients treated with first- and second-generation TKIs develop an EGFR exon 20 T790M mutation at the time of progression. In this context , osimertinib has shown a great benefit in terms of progression-free survival ( PFS) in the second-line setting , including central nervous system metastasis control. The FLAURA trial , which compared osimertinib to first-generation inhibitors as first-line therapy , showed a clear PFS advantage for osimertinib and a trend towards an increased overall survival ( OS) assessed by investigator review. Although T790M mutation is the most common mechanism of resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs , other EGFR-dependent and- independent mechanisms have been described , such as HER2 and MET amplifications or BRAF and MEK mutations. Some mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib and other third-generation TKIs have also been described. Several fourth-generation TKIs , targeted drug combinations and immunotherapy strategies are under investigation to overcome resistance to EGFR TKIs in order to improve EGFR-mutant NSCLC patient outcomes.
