  β-glucan extracted from raw and germinated foxtail and kodo millets were evaluated for its functional , rheological and in vitro antioxidant characteristics. The in vitro activity determined in terms of diphenyl-p-picryl hydrazy ( DPPH) radical scavenging activity and Ferric reducing antioxidant power ( FRAP) activity was found higher in germinated kodo millet ( 78.74 % , 48.98 %) compared to foxtail millet ( 34.96 % , 38.67 %) , respectively. Water binding capacity and swelling power of β-glucan extract of foxtail millet increased from 2.88 g/g to 3.06 g/g and 1.32 g/g to 1.67 g/g and that of kodo millet from 3.45 to 3.99 g/g and 2.54 to 2.99 g/g , respectively , after germination. There was a significant improvement in foaming capacity and stability of β-glucan after germination. The 'n' values were less than unity indicated that β-glucan extracts behaved pseudo-plastic like material. The storage modus ( G ') of β-glucan extracts of germinated kodo millet was higher than foxtail millets , as well as overall higher than the loss modulus ( G ″) indicating a dominantly viscoelastic behaviour and stability. Peak tanδ was lower for germinated foxtail millet compared to kodo millet indicating more stable gel of the former. Therefore , improvements in the functional as well rheological properties of β-glucan could be exploited in food and pharmaceutical industries.
