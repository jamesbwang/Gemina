  Precoital , on-demand topical microbicides to reduce a woman 's risk of sexually transmitted infections have been in development for nearly 3 decades , but no product has been approved due to acceptability issues and poor adherence in clinical trials. We set out to develop a self-administered vaginal fast-dissolving insert ( FDI) produced by freeze-drying that would deliver safe and effective amounts of the antiviral agents griffithsin ( GRFT) and carrageenan ( CG) and would have properties women and their partners find acceptable. We evaluated FDI physical criteria , attributes of the gel produced upon dissolving , and GRFT stability. The lead formulation , FDI-024 , was selected from 13 candidates and contains 4 mg of GRFT , 15 mg of CG , and excipients ( the cryoprotectant sucrose and bulking agents dextran 40 and mannitol). The FDI exhibits good friability and hardness and is stable for at least 6 months at up to 40 °C/ 75 % relative humidity. It disintegrates in less than 60 s in a physiologically relevant volume ( ∼ 1 mL) of simulated vaginal fluid , forming a viscous semi-solid gel with favorable mucoadhesive and spreading properties. The formulation retains the antiviral activity of GRFT and CG against HIV<pathogen> type 1 and human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> , respectively , in cell-based assays.
