  Arsenic methylation is regarded as an effective way of arsenic detoxification. Current knowledge about arsenic biomethylation in high arsenic groundwater remains limited. In the present study , 16 high arsenic groundwater samples from deep wells of the Hetao Plain were investigated using clone library and quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR) analyses of arsM genes as well as geochemical analysis. The concentrations of methylated arsenic ( including monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA)) varied from 2.40 to 16.85 μg/L. Both bacterial and archaeal arsenic methylating populations were detected in the high arsenic aquifer. They were dominated by Proteobacteria , Firmicutes , Gemmatimonadetes , Nitrospirae , Methanomicrobia and a large unidentified group. The abundances of predominant populations were correlated positively to either total organic carbon or total arsenic and arsenite concentrations. The arsM gene abundances in high arsenic groundwater ranged from below detection to 5.71 × 10
