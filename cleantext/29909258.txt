  In the present study , reflective seminars were integrated during a three-year nursing programme in Sweden. The specific characteristics of the reflective seminars are built upon a foundation in lifeworld theory and caring science. As teaching in higher education demands an academic degree but not necessarily formal pedagogical education , lecturers involved in reflective seminars are often left without guidance concerning what constitutes a reflective learning activity in nursing education. The aim of the present study is to describe the lived experience of guiding reflective seminars during nursing education from the lecturers ' perspective. Eight university lecturers were interviewed. To capture humans ' lived experiences , the present study is imbued with the principles of reflective lifeworld research. The result indicates that the reflective seminar includes the need for activity , balance<symptom> and safety , which is further developed through the following constituents: a foundation in caring science contributes to security; guiding the reflection requires continual vigilance; a lack of trust in oneself inhibits the ability to guide reflection and closeness to the students. In summary , the result indicates that guiding a reflective seminar is an exhausting mission in which the lecturer has to balance the moment according to a multifaceted level. Further development of mentoring and introduction to the assignment are needed.
