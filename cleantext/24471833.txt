  Photosystem II ( PSII) , a multisubunit protein complex of the photosynthetic electron transport chain , functions as a water-plastoquinone oxidoreductase , which is vital to the initiation of photosynthesis and electron transport. Although the structure , composition , and function of PSII are well understood , the mechanism of PSII biogenesis remains largely elusive. Here , we identified a nuclear-encoded pentatricopeptide repeat ( PPR) protein LOW PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY 1 ( LPE1; encoded by At3g46610) in
