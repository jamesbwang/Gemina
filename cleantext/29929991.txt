  Adipokines mediate cardiometabolic risk associated with obesity but their role in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated heart<symptom> failure<symptom> remains uncertain. We investigated the associations between circulating adipokine concentrations and echocardiographic measures in a community-based sample. We evaluated 3514 Framingham Heart Study participants ( mean age 40 years , 53.8 % women) who underwent routine echocardiography and had select circulating adipokines measured , ie , leptin , soluble leptin receptor , fatty acid-binding protein 4 , retinol-binding protein 4 , fetuin-A , and adiponectin. We used multivariable linear regression , adjusting for known correlates ( including weight) , to relate adipokine concentrations ( independent variables) to the following echocardiographic measures ( dependent variables): left ventricular mass index , left atrial diameter in end systole , fractional shortening , and E/e '. In multivariable-adjusted analysis , left ventricular mass index was inversely related to circulating leptin and fatty acid-binding protein 4 concentrations but positively related to retinol-binding protein 4 and leptin receptor levels ( In our cross-sectional study of a large , young to middle-aged , relatively healthy community-based sample , key indices of subclinical cardiac remodeling were associated with higher or lower circulating concentrations of prohypertrophic and antihypertrophic adipokines in a context-specific manner. These observations may offer insights into the pathogenesis of the cardiomyopathy of obesity.
