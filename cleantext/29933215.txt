  The use of saline in preserving bone specimens may affect the mechanical properties of specimens. Yet , the reported effects varied and contradicted to each other , with a lack of investigating constitutive material parameters. Therefore , we quantified the effects of preservation time on the constitutive properties of cortical bone. We collected 120 specimens from the mid-diaphysis of six male bovine femora , which were assigned to five groups , including fresh-frozen for 60 days ( -20 °C) , storage in saline for 3 , 10 , 36 and 60 days ( 25 °C). All specimens underwent quasi-static three-point bending tests with a loading rate of 0.02 mm/s. Using the optimization method combined with specimen-specific finite element models , the Young 's modulus , tangent modulus , yield stress , effective plastic strain , yield strain , ultimate stress , and toughness were calculated. Saline preservation resulted in a significant decrease of Young 's modulus , yield stress , ultimate stress and pre-yield toughness ( P < 0.001) , and a significant increase of effective plastic strain ( P = 0.034). After 10 days of preservation , yield stress and pre-yield toughness decreased -14.9 % and -21.4 % , respectively , and they continued to decrease with longer preservation time. After 36 days of preservation , Young 's modulus and ultimate stress decreased -19.2 % and -17.3 % , respectively , and continued to decrease with longer preservation time. Our data also showed changes of material properties collected after 3-day saline preservation , while the low statistical power must be considered for this group. Saline preservation impacts on mechanical properties of cortical bone tissue and the effect is already observable after 3 days.
