  Short-term outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) has improved dramatically , but the association between clinical or angiographic characteristics and long-term outcome remains less well described. The SYNTAX ( Synergy Between PCI With TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery) II score has been designed to overcome the limitations of the purely angiographic SYNTAX I score by including clinical parameters and comorbidities. It has not been tested extensively in `` real-world '' PCI patients , outside of randomized clinical studies. We identified unique patients undergoing PCI between January 1 , 2011 and January 24 , 2013 and followed for at least 60 days. We calculated the SYNTAX I and II scores for each patient and collected data at longest follow-up available for vital status , recurrent PCI , systolic heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , stroke , or Q-wave myocardial infarction. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess independent predictors of mortality. There were 831 patients followed for a mean of 4 years. The average age was 66 ± 10 years. Nearly 40 % were women and 50 % had diabetes mellitus. The mean follow-up interval was 4 years , during which 42 patients died ( Kaplan-Meier rate , 4.3 % ( IQR , 3.0-6.2 %)). The PCI-SYNTAX II score was significantly higher in patients who died than in survivors ( 43 ± 12 vs 32 ± 12 , respectively; P < .001). The SYNTAX II score was the only variable associated with death at a mean follow-up of 4 years ( hazard ratio per 1 point , 1.05 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.03-1.08); P < .001). The SYNTAX II score , incorporating angiographic and clinical parameters , is a useful tool for risk stratification and prediction of 4-year mortality in `` real-world '' patients.
