  The objective of the present study is to improve iron bioavailability using high-density gastroretentive pellets of zero valent iron nanoparticles ( ZVINPs). ZVINPs were prepared by the chemical reduction method and were characterized for surface morphology , surface charge , and thermal properties. High-density gastroretentive pellets of iron nanoparticles were prepared using spheronization technique. Pellets were characterized for its micromeritic properties , in vitro drug release , and ex vivo permeability. The pharmacokinetic parameters , organ distribution , and toxicity of the optimized pellets were investigated in Wistar rats. In vivo results revealed more than 2-fold increases in oral bioavailability of iron by pellets compared to plane ferrous sulfate. Toxicological studies of the carriers indicated no evidence of liver damage in acute treatment; however , few complications were observed in chronic treatment groups. These results indicated that ZVINPs pellets successfully improve the oral iron bioavailability but need to obtain more information on repeated dose toxicity to initiate the clinical evaluation of investigational products.
