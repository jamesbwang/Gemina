  Chronic kidney disease is characterized by structural and/or functional impairment of one or both kidneys persisting for more than 3 months. In cats , chronic kidney disease can frequently occur in animals aged over 9 years with an incidence of approximately 10 %. Thirty-four client-owned , neutered cats , suffering from stage II-III chronic kidney disease and diagnosed according to the International Renal Interest Society guidelines were randomly assigned to receive either a control diet ( n = 17) or a nutraceutical diet ( ND; n = 17) for 90 days. Both diets were commercialized for management of CKD symptoms. The diets were identical except that the ND contained tablets that consisted of 60-80 % hydrolysed proteins , 20-40 % minerals and active substances , that are , Lespedeza spp. 0.0588 % , Vaccinium macrocarpom 0.0371 % , and Taraxacum officinale 0.0231 %. No adverse effects were reported during this study. Both diets resulted in an improvement in CKD symptoms. After a 90-day evaluation , creatinine , blood urea nitrogen , total proteins , and aspartate aminotransferase significantly decreased in cats that received the ND. A significant decrease was also observed in urine turbidity score , color score , and total proteins in cats that received the ND. We have found that a ND based on Lespedeza spp. , Vaccinium macrocarpon , and Taraxacum officinale improves key indicators of renal<symptom> failure<symptom> in cats affected by chronic kidney disease.
