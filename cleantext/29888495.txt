  In the present work , gelatin type B is modified with highly reactive norbornene functionalities ( Gel-NB) following a one-pot synthesis approach to enable subsequent thiol-ene photo-click crosslinking. The modification strategy displays close control over the amount of introduced functionalities. Additionally , Gel-NB exhibits considerably improved processing capabilities in terms of two-photon polymerization when benchmarked to earlier-reported crosslinkable gelatin derivatives ( e.g. , gelatin-methacrylamide ( Gel-MOD) and gelatin-methacrylamide-aminoethylmethacrylate ( Gel-MOD-AEMA)). The improvement is especially apparent in terms of minimally required laser power ( 20 mW vs ≥ 60 mW ( Gel-MOD) vs ≥ 40 mW ( Gel-MOD-AEMA) at 100 mm s
