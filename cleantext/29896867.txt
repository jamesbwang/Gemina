  The presence of synthetic dyes in wastewaters generated by the textile industry constitutes a serious environmental and health problem that urges the scientific community on an appropriate action. As a proof-of-concept , we have developed a novel approach to design enzymatic bioreactors with the ability to decolorize dye solutions through the immobilization of the bacterial CueO laccase-like multicopper oxidase from Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> on polyhydroxybutyrate ( PHB) beads by making use of the BioF affinity tag. The decolorization efficiency of the system was characterized by a series of parameters , namely maximum enzyme adsorption capacity , pH profile , kinetic constants , substrate range , temperature and bioreactor recycling. Depending on the tested dye , immobilization increased the catalytic activity of CueO by up to 40-fold with respect to the soluble enzyme , reaching decolorization efficiencies of 45-90 %. Our results indicate that oxidase bioreactors based on polyhydroxyalkanoates are a promising alternative for the treatment of coloured industrial wastewaters.
