  A cylinder phantom positioned at a slightly oblique angle with respect to the z-axis of a PET scanner , allows for very fine sampling of the edge spread function. We show how this technique can be used to measure the spatial resolution that can be expected with clinical PET protocols , potentially providing more relevant estimates than are typically obtained with established experimental procedures.
