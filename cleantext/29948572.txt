  The skin is the largest organ of the body , at the boundary with the outside environment. Primarily , it provides a physical and chemical barrier against external insults , but it can act also as immune organ because it contains a whole host of immune-competent cells of both the innate and the adaptive immune systems , which cooperate in eliminating invading pathogens following tissue injury. On the other hand , improper skin immune responses lead to autoimmune skin diseases ( AISD) , such as pemphigus , bullous pemphigoid , vitiligo , and alopecia. Although the interplay among genetic , epigenetic , and environmental factors has been shown to play a major role in AISD etiology and progression , the molecular mechanisms underlying disease development are far from being fully elucidated. In this context , epidemiological studies aimed at defining the association of different AISD with other autoimmune pathologies revealed possible shared molecular mechanism ( s) responsible for disease progression. In particular , over the last decades , a number of reports have highlighted a significant association between thyroid diseases ( TD) , mainly autoimmune ones ( AITD) , and AISD. Here , we will recapitulate the epidemiology , clinical manifestations , and pathogenesis of the main AISD , and we will summarize the epidemiological evidence showing the associations with TD as well as possible molecular mechanism ( s) underlying TD and AISD pathological manifestations.
