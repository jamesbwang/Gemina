  Liquid biopsies represent a potential revolution in cancer diagnostics as a noninvasive method for detecting and monitoring diseases , complementary to or even replacing current tissue biopsy approaches. Several blood-based biosources and biomolecules , such as cell-free DNA and RNA , proteins , circulating tumor cells , and extracellular vesicles , have been explored for molecular test development. We recently discovered the potential of tumor-educated blood platelets ( TEP) as a noninvasive biomarker trove for RNA biomarker panels. TEPs are involved in the progression and spread of several solid tumors , and spliced TEP RNA surrogate signatures can provide specific information on the presence , location , and molecular characteristics of cancers. So far , TEP samples from patients with different tumor types , including lung , brain , and breast cancers , have been tested , and it has been shown that TEPs from patients with cancer are distinct from those with inflammatory and other noncancerous diseases. It remains to be investigated how platelets are `` educated , '' which mechanisms cause intraplatelet RNA splicing , and whether the relative contribution of specific platelet subpopulations changes in patients with cancer. Ultimately , TEP RNA may complement currently used biosources and biomolecules employed for liquid biopsy diagnosis , potentially enhancing the detection of cancer in an early stage and facilitating noninvasive disease monitoring.
