  To examine associations between socioeconomic status and the extent to which patients with cancer of the head and neck expressed concerns to surgeons during routine follow-up clinics , we analysed audio recordings of 110 consultations with one consultant. We used the Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequences ( VRCoDES) to measure communication between the doctor and the patient , and grouped the English indices of multiple deprivation ( IMD) 2015 scores into deciles to compare the VRCoDES with socioeconomic status. There were no significant correlations between IMD decile and the number and type of cues and concerns , or the type of response by the consultant , but there was a positive correlation between IMD decile and duration of appointment ( r = 0.288 , p < 0.01). When the duration of appointment was controlled for , there was a negative correlation between IMD decile and number of cues and concerns ( r = -0.221 , p < 0.05). These findings question the assumption that socioeconomic status is associated with a patient 's willingness to express concerns. Shorter consultations suggest that less time is spent responding to their concerns or building a rapport. Clinicians might find it advantageous to adopt strategies that will improve their understanding of these patients and help them to communicate more effectively.
