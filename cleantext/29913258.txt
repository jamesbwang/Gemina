  Punch grafting for vitiligo has been time-consuming and may result in cobblestone-like appearances. We devised a motorized 0.8 mm micro-punch grafting procedure to overcome these limitations. To assess the therapeutic effectiveness and adverse events associated with micro-punch grafting in refractory vitiligo. We retrospectively reviewed 230 lesions<symptom> in 208 patients with stable vitiligo who underwent motorized 0.8 mm micro-punch grafting between January 2015 and August 2017. Treatment success was defined as â‰¥ 75 % repigmentation , and factors associated with the outcome were assessed. Overall , 181 of 230 lesions<symptom> ( 78.7 %) achieved treatment success after a median of 6 months with postoperative excimer therapy. Segmental vitiligo and the location of the lesions<symptom> on the face and neck were independent prognostic factors. Common adverse events were color mismatch ( 24.8 %) and a cobblestone appearance ( 18.3 %). Overall , the treatment was tolerable. This was a retrospective study. Micro-punch grafting using a motorized 0.8 mm punch can successfully treat refractory vitiligo with short procedure times and excellent outcomes. This technique could be a rapid and convenient surgical option with acceptable adverse events and is promising for treating refractory vitiligo on an outpatient basis , particularly in patients who are unlikely to tolerate prolonged surgery.
