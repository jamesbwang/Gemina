  The central nervous system involvement , in terms of a maladaptive sensory-motor plasticity , is well known in patients with dystrophic myotonias ( DMs). To date , there are no data suggesting a central nervous system involvement in non-dystrophic myotonias ( NDMs). To investigate sensory-motor plasticity in patients with Myotonia Congenita ( MC) and Paramyotonia Congenita ( PMC) with or without mexiletine. Twelve patients with a clinical , genetic , and electromyographic evidence of MC , fifteen with PMC , and 25 healthy controls ( HC) were included in the study. TMS on both primary motor cortices ( M1) and a rapid paired associative stimulation ( rPAS) paradigm were carried out to assess M1 excitability and sensory-motor plasticity. patients showed a higher cortical excitability and a deterioration of the topographic specificity of rPAS aftereffects , as compared to HCs. There was no correlation among neurophysiological and clinical-demographic characteristics. Noteworthy , the patients who were under mexiletine showed a minor impairment of the topographic specificity of rPAS aftereffects as compared to those who did not take the drug. our findings could suggest the deterioration of cortical sensory-motor plasticity in patients with NDMs as a trait of the disease.
