  The hypothesis of this study was that arginine supplementation would overcome negative effects of restricted maternal feed intake during the last two-thirds of gestation on ewe performance and positively affect postnatal lamb growth and development. Multiparous , Rambouillet ewes ( n = 32) were allocated to 3 treatments in a completely random design at 54 ± 3.9 d of gestation. Dietary treatments were 100 % of nutrient requirements ( control , CON) , 60 % of control ( restricted , RES) , or RES plus a rumen-protected arginine supplement dosed at 180 mg/kg BW once daily ( RES-ARG). Ewes were penned individually in a temperature-controlled facility. At parturition , lambs were immediately removed from dams and reared independently. At day 54 ± 3 of age , lambs were stunned using captive bolt , exsanguinated , and organs were collected and weighed. Ewe BW from day 68 of gestation through parturition was greater ( P ≤ 0.03) in CON compared with RES or RES-ARG. Similarly , ewe BCS from day 68 of gestation through parturition was greater ( P ≤ 0.03) in CON than either RES or RES-ARG. Total ewe colostrum mass ( g) at 3 h after parturition was greater ( P ≤ 0.001) in CON than RES or RES-ARG. Lamb birth weight was greater ( P = 0.04) in CON than RES ewes and tended ( P = 0.10) to be greater in CON vs. RES-ARG. Lambs born to CON ewes had greater ( P ≤ 0.03) BW than lambs from RES ewes at 7 , 14 , and 33 d postpartum. On day 19 , lambs from CON and RES-ARG ewes both had greater ( P ≤ 0.04) BW than lambs from RES ewes ( 12.0 and 11.5 vs. 10.3 ± 0.41 kg , respectively). Lambs born to CON and RES-ARG ewes had greater ( P ≤ 0.04) ADG than lambs from RES ewes on day 19 ( 355.0 and 354.0 vs. 306.4 ± 15.77 g , respectively). Lambs from CON and RES-ARG ewes also had greater ( P ≤ 0.02) girth circumference than lambs from RES ewes on day 19 ( 55.4 and 54.6 vs. 51.3 ± 0.97 cm , respectively). On day 54 , lambs from RES-ARG ewes had greater ( P = 0.003) curved crown rump length than lambs from RES ewes ( 99.8 vs. 93.9 ± 1.28 cm , respectively). Adrenal glands in lambs from CON dams had greater ( P = 0.01) mass than adrenal glands in lambs from RES dams. Livers from lambs born to RES-ARG ewes weighed more ( P = 0.05) than livers from lambs born to RES ewes. These results confirm our hypothesis that arginine supplementation during the last two-thirds of gestation can mitigate offspring , but not maternal negative consequences associated with restricted maternal nutrition.
