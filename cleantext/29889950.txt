  Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death among American Indians and Alaska Natives ( AI/AN). Utilizing narratives from members of a Pacific Northwest tribe , this paper explores perceptions about behaviors affecting cardiovascular health through tribal members ' lived experiences related to place-based environmental historical trauma. Findings from narrative analysis indicate that ambivalence is an effect of historical trauma and complicates the adoption of protective cardiovascular health behaviors. Tribal narratives indicate a path to overcome this ambivalence stemming from historical environmental trauma through revitalization , adaptation , and re-integration of traditional cultural practices to contemporary contexts. By creating their own health promotion response , one that is not imposed or colonizing , tribal members are re-generating cultural practices and health behaviors associated with lowered risks of cardiovascular disease.
