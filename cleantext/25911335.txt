  Mac-2-binding protein glycosylation isomer ( M2BPGi) , a novel serum marker for liver fibrosis<disease> , was seldom studied in chronic hepatitis<disease> B<disease> ( CHB). We aimed to evaluate its role on diagnosing significant fibrosis<disease> and cirrhosis in treated CHB patients. CHB patients treated with nucleos ( t) ide analogues ( NAs) with baseline liver biopsies and retrievable serum samples were recruited. Paired liver biopsies were performed in patient subgroups at 1 and 3 years. In total , 327 NA-treated CHB patients ( M: F = 229:98; median age 38.1 years) were recruited. The median M2BPGi values were 0.26 , 0.34 , 0.57 and 1.21 cutoff index ( COI) , in liver histology with Ishak F0-1 , F2 , F3 and F4 , respectively ( p < 0.01). M2BPGi levels correlated with the Ishak scores ( ρ = 0.312 , p < 0.001). Using the cutoff values of 0.25 , 0.45 and 0.96 COI for ≥ F2 , ≥ F3 and F4 , the AUROCs were 0.653 , 0.795 and 0.914 , respectively. Multivariate analysis with several other serum indices showed that M2BPGi was the most significant independent factor for ≥ F3 ( OR: 8.197 , 95 % CI: 2.699-24.897 , p < 0.001). In patient subgroups with serial liver biopsies , both the proportion of F3/F4 and M2BPGi decreased at 1 year ( 8.3 % vs. 2.8 % and 0.32 vs. 0.21 COI , respectively; both p < 0.001). Histological fibrosis<disease> progression after ≥ 3 years of NA therapy accompanied with an increase in M2BPGi level , compared to patients without progression ( +0.14 vs -0.03 COI , p = 0.045). Serum M2BPGi is a reliable non-invasive marker for diagnosing ≥ F2 , ≥ F3 and F4. It is the only significant marker for ≥ F3 among several other indices. NA produced concordant dynamic changes in M2BPGi levels and histological
