  In a consensus process with four sessions in 2017 , the working group `` upper cervical spine '' of the German Society for Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery ( DGOU) formulated `` Therapeutic Recommendations for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Upper<symptom> Cervical Fractures '' , taking their own experience and the current literature into consideration. The following article describes the recommendations for axis ring fractures ( traumatic spondylolysis C2). About 19 to 49 % of all cervical spine injuries include the axis vertebra. Traumatic spondylolysis of C2 may include potential discoligamentous instability C2/3. The primary aim of the diagnostic process is to detect the injury and to determine potential disco-ligamentous instability C2/3. For classification purposes , the Josten classification or the modified Effendi classification may be used. The Canadian C-spine rule is recommended for clinical screening for C-spine injuries. CT is the preferred imaging modality and an MRI is needed to determine the integrity of the discoligamentous complex C2/3. Conservative treatment is appropriate in case of stable fractures with intact C2/3 motion segment ( Josten type 2 and 2). Patients should be closely monitored , in order to detect secondary dislocation as early as possible. Surgical treatment is recommended in cases of primary severe fracture dislocation or discoligamentous instability C2/3 ( Josten 3 and 4) and/or secondary fracture dislocation. Anterior cervical decompression and fusion ( ACDF) C2/3 is the treatment of choice. However , in case of facet joint luxation C2/3 with looked facet ( Josten 4) , a primary posterior approach may be necessary.
