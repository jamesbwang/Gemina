  Preoperative low skeletal muscle mass and density are associated with increased postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing curative colorectal cancer ( CRC) surgery. However , the long-term effects of low skeletal muscle mass and density remain uncertain. Patients with stage I-III CRC undergoing surgery , enrolled in a prospective observational cohort study , were included. Skeletal muscle mass and density were measured on CT.. Patients with high and low skeletal muscle mass and density were compared regarding postoperative complications , disease-free survival ( DFS) , overall survival ( OS) , and cancer-specific survival ( CSS). In total , 816 patients ( 53.9 % males , median age 70) were included; 50.4 % had low skeletal muscle mass and 64.1 % low density. The severe postoperative complication rate was significantly higher in patients with low versus high skeletal muscle and density ( 20.9 % versus 13.6 % , p = 0.006; 20.0 % versus 11.8 % , p = 0.003). Low skeletal muscle mass ( OR 1.91 , p = 0.018) and density ( OR 1.87 , p = 0.045) were independently associated with severe postoperative complications. Ninety-day mortality was higher in patients with low skeletal muscle mass and density compared with patients with high skeletal muscle mass and density ( 3.6 % versus 1.7 % , p = 0.091; 3.4 % versus 1.0 % , p = 0.038). No differences in DFS were observed. After adjustment for covariates such as age and comorbidity , univariate differences in OS and CSS diminished. Low skeletal muscle mass and density are associated with short-term , but not long-term , outcome in patients undergoing CRC surgery. These findings recommend putting more emphasis on preoperative management of patients at risk for surgical complications , but do not support benefit for long-term outcome.
