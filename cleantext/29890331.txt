  Over the last decades , poultry industry faced to the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria as a global concern. Antimicrobial peptide ( AMPs) known as potential antibiotic alternative and were considered as a new antimicrobial agent. Current methods of production and purification of AMPs have several limitations such as: costly , time-consuming and killing the producing host cells in recombinant form. In the present study , a chimeric peptide derived from camel lactoferrin was produced in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> periplasmic space using a pET-based expression system and its antibacterial activity was determined on some avian pathogens in vitro. A carboxy-terminal polyhistidine tag was used for purification by Ni
