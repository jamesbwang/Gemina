  Parental gender expectations , which may be egalitarian or not , may vary by nativity and socioeconomic status. Parental gender expectations provide a model for children 's gender role attitudes and could also have effects on reproductive health over the life course , including women 's contraceptive choices. Yet , parental gender expectations are not often studied quantitatively. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health , we examine how parental gender expectations in the United States vary by immigrant generation and socioeconomic status , whether parental gender expectations in adolescence are associated with young women 's contraceptive use , and if nativity moderates that relationship. Results show that parental gender expectations vary significantly by immigrant generation and parental socioeconomic status. Both first and second generation women are significantly less likely to have lived in households with equal gender expectations compared to the third generation. Higher socioeconomic status is associated with equal gender expectations. Among participants from households with equal gender expectations , the second generation is more likely than the third generation is to use a male-controlled contraceptive method versus no method. Using a nationally representative sample , our study demonstrates that parental gender expectations vary by nativity and by the socioeconomic context of the family in which they are embedded as well as have a unique effect on the contraceptive behavior of second generation women.
