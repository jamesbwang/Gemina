  The results of a study comparing model calibration techniques for Ogden 's constitutive model that describes the hyperelastic behavior of brain tissue are presented. One and two-term Ogden models are fit to two different sets of stress-strain experimental data for brain tissue using both least squares optimization and Bayesian estimation. For the Bayesian estimation , the joint posterior distribution of the constitutive parameters is calculated by employing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ( HMC) sampling , a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The HMC method is enriched in this work to intrinsically enforce the Drucker stability criterion by formulating a nonlinear parameter constraint function , which ensures the constitutive model produces physically meaningful results. Through application of the nested sampling technique , 95 % confidence bounds on the constitutive model parameters are identified , and these bounds are then propagated through the constitutive model to produce the resultant bounds on the stress-strain response. The behavior of the model calibration procedures and the effect of the characteristics of the experimental data are extensively evaluated. It is demonstrated that increasing model complexity ( i.e. , adding an additional term in the Ogden model) improves the accuracy of the best-fit set of parameters while also increasing the uncertainty via the widening of the confidence bounds of the calibrated parameters. Despite some similarity between the two data sets , the resulting distributions are noticeably different , highlighting the sensitivity of the calibration procedures to the characteristics of the data. For example , the amount of uncertainty reported on the experimental data plays an essential role in how data points are weighted during the calibration , and this significantly affects how the parameters are calibrated when combining experimental data sets from disparate sources.
