  To understand the knowledge , attitude , and practice of healthcare practitioners in Saudi Arabia , with regard to vitamin D supplementation. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among healthcare practitioners in the Tabuk region of Saudi Arabia between January 2015 and December 2016. A questionnaire assessing knowledge , attitude and practice with regard to prevention of vitamin D deficiency was distributed to 100 healthcare practitioners. There was a good understanding of the importance of vitamin D deficiency; and overall practices were good. The average knowledge score was 4.75/ 8 ( range 2-7) , largely due to 85 % of recipients identifying sun exposure between 6-7 am as the optimal time. There was a lack of understanding also , that as little as 10 minutes exposure is of benefit. This study highlights the need for distribution of the recommendations for vitamin D supplementation in KSA , as widely as possible. This study suggests that healthcare practitioners understand the importance of correction of vitamin D deficiency. Deficiencies in knowledge with regard to sun exposure were identified. Dissemination of this information is , therefore , likely to impact significantly on the practice of a receptive clinical population.
