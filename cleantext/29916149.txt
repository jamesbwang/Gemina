  Arsenic ( As) contamination in drinking water is a global public health risk. The present study highlighted the geological and anthropogenic causes of As contamination in groundwater ( GW) and surface water ( SW) and assessment of their potential health risks in Sindh province of Pakistan. Upon analyzing 720 GW and SW samples from 18 different sites , the estimates of As in groundwater and surface water was observed in the range of 0 to 125 and 0 to 35 μg/L with mean values of 46.8 and 15.43 μg/L respectively. Majority of the samples exceeded WHO permissible limit of As ( 10 μg/L) with higher concentration detected in groundwater samples compared to surface water. Moreover , both of these sample sources were found not potable based on physicochemical characteristics. The results of statistical analysis ( correlation analysis , principal component analysis ( PCA) , and hierarchy cluster analysis ( HCA)) indicate that natural mobilization of As in groundwater is believed to be enhanced by the pH-based reductive dissolution of iron hydroxide ( FeOH) and competitive sorption of bicarbonate minerals in the presence of microorganisms along with evaporative enrichment while water logging , coal mining , and excessive use of pesticides are believed to be the anthropogenic causes of As enrichment. Furthermore , enormous health risk was associated with As in terms of chronic daily intake ( CRI) , hazard quotient ( HQ) , and cancer risk probability ( CR) in GW and SW. Mean HQ values in GW were 4.47 mg/kg/day in adults and 3.89 mg/kg/day in children ( standard HQ ≤ 1) and was 1.43 and 1.28 mg/kg/day in SW. Mean CR value in both GW and SW was found higher than the safe limit ( 10
