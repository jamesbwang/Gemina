  The aim was to study follow-up care attendance in adolescent and young adult ( AYA) cancer survivors to investigate: ( 1) correlates of the intention to attend follow-up care and ( 2) whether the intention is associated with the actual attendance , applying the theory of planned behavior ( TPB). We conducted a questionnaire survey in AYA cancer survivors diagnosed 1990-2005 at age 16-25 years , registered in the Cancer Registry Zurich and Zug , Switzerland , who had survived at least 5 years. Structural equation modeling was applied to investigate TPB-related correlates ( attitudes , subjective norms , and perceived behavioral control) of intention to attend follow-up care. Logistic regression analysis was used to study the association between intention and actual attendance. We included 160 AYA cancer survivors in the study ( mean age at study: 34.0 years , mean age at diagnosis: 21.6 years , 98 ( 61.3 %) male). Positive attitudes toward follow-up care ( coefficient = 0.32 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 0.05 to 0.60) and supportive subjective norms ( coefficient = 0.59 , 95 % CI: 0.41 to 0.78) were associated with higher intention to attend follow-up care. Perceived behavioral control was not associated with intention to attend ( coefficient = -0.13 , 95 % CI: -0.36 to 0.10) , but with actual attendance ( odds ratio ( OR) = 4.55 , 95 % CI: 1.83 to 11.31). Higher intention was associated with actual follow-up care attendance ( OR = 14.29 , 95 % CI: 5.80 to 35.21). Positive attitudes and supportive social norms were associated with higher intention to attend follow-up care , and higher intention was associated with actual follow-up care attendance. Increasing awareness of the importance and benefits of follow-up care not only among survivors but also family , friends and healthcare professionals may help increase follow-up care attendance among AYA cancer survivors.
