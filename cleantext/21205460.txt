  This study aims to investigate the relationship between smoking and structural damage , autoimmune antibodies , and disability in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> ( RA) patients. This cross-sectional study included 165 RA patients ( 36 males , 129 females; mean age 52.4 ± 12.8 years; range 21 to 82 years). Disease duration , age at disease onset , smoking habits , rheumatoid factor ( RF) , and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide levels were recorded. Morning stiffness , pain with visual analog scale , Health Assessment Questionnaire Scores And Disease Activity Score 28 were calculated. Patients ' standard hand radiographs were evaluated. Patients were divided into three groups according to their smoking habits. Ninety-nine patients ( 60 %) were never smokers , 45 patients ( 27.3 %) were long-term smokers and 21 patients ( 12.7 %) were new smokers. Three groups were compared for disease activity. Disease activity score 28 scores were 3.2 ± 1.2 , 3.2 ± 1.3 , and 3.2 ± 1.4 , respectively ( p > 0.05). The erosion score ( 2.6 ± 5.8 , 7.1 ± 10.9 , and 11.1 ± 19.2 , respectively) and joint space narrowing score ( 9.9 ± 7.3 , 18.6 ± 14.9 , and 17.3 ± 12.3 , respectively) according to modified Sharp method were significantly lower in never smokers group than other groups ( p < 0.05). RF titrations were 55.2 ± 58.9 , 60.5 ± 63.1 , and 84.9 ± 71.5 , respectively , and levels of long-term smokers group were significantly higher than the other groups ( p < 0.05). Joint space narrowing score was 16.2 ± 11.9 and 6.4 ± 10.4 in RF ( +) and RF (-) patients , respectively ( p < 0.05). There was no significant relationship between anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide levels and others parameters. Although smoking is known as a poor prognostic factor in RA , there was no correlation between disease activity and smoking in our study. However , less radiographic damage was found in never smokers. Smoking does not appear to correlate with RA disease activity but it may be effective in the long-term joint damage.
