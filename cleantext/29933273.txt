  Although endogenous analgesia plays an important role in controlling pain states , chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> patients exhibit decreased endogenous analgesia compared to healthy individuals. In rats , noxious stimulus-induced analgesia ( NSIA) , which is an indicator of endogenous analgesia , diminished 6 weeks after spinal nerve ligation ( SNL6W). A recent study in rats with deleted noradrenergic fibers demonstrated that the noradrenergic fibers were essential to NSIA. It has also been reported that brain-derived neurotrophic factor increased spinal noradrenergic fibers. Therefore , this study examined the effect of TrkB activation , which is the receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor , on impaired NSIA in SNL6W rats. In addition , we also examined the effect of endogenous analgesia on acute incisional pain. After 5 daily intraperitoneal injections of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone ( 7,8-DHF , TrkB agonist , 5 mg/kg) , NSIA was examined by measuring the withdrawal threshold increment in the left ( contralateral to nerve ligation) hindpaw at 30 minutes after capsaicin injection ( 250 μg) in the forepaw. K252a ( TrkB antagonist , 2 μg) was administrated intrathecally for 5 days. Idazoxan ( α2 adrenoceptor antagonist , 30 μg) , atropine ( muscarinic antagonist , 30 μg) , and propranolol ( nonselective β adrenoceptor antagonist , 30 μg) were administered intrathecally for 15 minutes before capsaicin injection. Microdialysis and immunohistochemistry were performed to examine the noradrenergic plasticity in the spinal dorsal horn. A hindpaw incision was performed on the left ( contralateral to nerve ligation) hindpaw. Data were analyzed by 1-way analyses of variance or 2-way repeated-measures 1-way analysis of variance followed by a Student t test with Bonferroni correction. Five daily intraperitoneal injections of 7,8-DHF restored the attenuated NSIA in SNL6W rats ( n = 7 , P = .002; estimated treatment effect ( 95 % CI): 62.9 ( 27.0-98.7) g) , with this effect blocked by 5 daily intrathecal coadministrations of K252a ( n = 6 , P < .001; -57.8 ( -78.3 to -37.2) g). This effect was also inhibited by a single intrathecal administration of idazoxan ( n = 8 , P < .001; -61.6 ( -92.4 to -30.9) g) and atropine ( n = 8 , P = .003; -52.6 ( -73.3 to -31.9) g) , but not by propranolol. Furthermore , 7,8-DHF increased the noradrenergic fiber in the spinal dorsal horn and the noradrenaline release in response to the capsaicin injection in the forepaw in SNL6W rats. In addition , repeated injections of 7,8-DHF prevented delayed recovery from incisional pain in SNL6W rats. Spinal activation of TrkB may recover the attenuated endogenous analgesia by improving the adrenergic plasticity , thereby leading to prevention of pain prolongation after surgery.
