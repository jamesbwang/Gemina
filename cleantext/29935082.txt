  The aim of this study was to clarify the additional effect of a concomitant elemental diet ( ED) for patients with Crohn 's disease on maintenance anti-tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-Î± antibody ( anti-TNF). Crohn 's disease patients who received anti-TNF induction therapy were enrolled. Patients who achieved clinical response ( defined as delta Crohn 's disease activity index ( CDAI) > 70 and CDAI < 200) at 10-14 weeks after the start of infliximab or adalimumab were included. Eligible patients took a tolerability test of ED ( 900 kcal/day) for 3 days. Then , patients who preferred concomitant ED and whose ED tolerance was confirmed were allocated to the ED group and given Elental 900 kcal/day or more. Other patients were allocated to the non-ED group. The primary endpoint was the cumulative remission rate at 2 years after baseline. Clinical relapse was defined as CDAI > 200 and/or need for additional treatment. Adherence to the ED was confirmed at each visit. Seventy-two patients were included. Thirty-seven were allocated to the ED group , and 35 were allocated to the non-ED group. The cumulative remission rate at 2 years was not significantly different between the two groups ( 60.9 % vs 56.7 % , P = 0.98). Adherence to the ED in the ED group was relatively low , and only 11 patients were maintained on an ED of 900 kcal/day. The addition of ED for Crohn 's disease patients who responded to initial anti-TNF induction therapy was not found to improve outcomes. The efficacy of concomitant ED in other clinical settings , such as loss of response , needs to be clarified in the future ( UMIN000009789).
