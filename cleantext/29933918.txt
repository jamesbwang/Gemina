  This study aims to determine the incidence of pain in childbirth and postpartum on depressive and post-traumatic symptomatology 6weeks after delivery. One hundred and nine women who gave birth in maternity hospitals of type 2 $ participated in the study. Two to four days after delivery they have completed five self-administered questionnaires to assess pain of childbirth ( QDSA) , dramatization of pain ( PCS-CF) , satisfaction of childbirth ( CEQ) , peri-traumatic distress ( IDP) and depressive symptoms ( EPDS) and visual analogue scales to measure immediate postnatal pain. Six weeks after birth they have again completed questionnaires to measure pain ( QDSA and visual analogue scales) and depressive symptoms ( EPDS) and a scale measuring posttraumatic symptomatology ( IES-R). The pain of childbirth and immediate postpartum was associated with depressive ( r = 0.27 and r = 0.31 respectively) and traumatic symptomatology ( r = 0.30 and r = 0.34 respectively) in postpartum. Regression analysis , however , revealed that only the depressive symptomatology and the affective dimension of postpartum pain at six weeks post-partum was related to post-traumatic stress. The results of this study highlight the importance to support the pain of childbirth but also the pain occurring in the postpartum period.
