  To develop and validate a clinically applicable and easy-to-use accelerometry-based device to measure arm use in people after stroke; the Activ8 arm use monitor ( Activ8-AUM). Development and validation study. A total of 25 people at different stages of rehabilitation after stroke were included in this study. The Activ8-AUM consists of 3 single-sensor Activ8s: one on the unaffected thigh and one on each wrist. Arm use was calculated by combining movement intensity of the arms with data from body posture<symptom> and movements on the leg sensor. Data were divided into 2 sets: one for determining situation-specific movement intensity thresholds for arm use , and the other to validate the Activ8-AUM using video recordings. Overall agreement between the Activ8-AUM and video recordings was 75 % , sensitivity was 73 % and specificity was 77 %. Agreement between the different categories of arm use ranged from 42 % to 93 % for the affected arm and from 24 % to 82 % for the unaffected arm. By combining the movement intensity threshold with body posture<symptom> and movements , good agreement was reached between the Activ8-AUM and video recordings. This result , together with the easy-to-use configuration , makes the Activ8-AUM a promising device to measure arm use in people after stroke.
