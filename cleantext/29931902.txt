  To prospectively clarify the predictive value of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP) on the risk for recurrent atrial arrhythmia in paroxysmal atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( PAF) population who accepted radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA) of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF). There were 57 consecutive patients ( 53.32 Â± 9.98 years; 42 males) with drug-refractory PAF who underwent RFCA were included. Plasma levels of hsCRP and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T ( hs-cTnT) were measured on admission and first five days after RFCA. Twenty-five patients ( 43.86 %) had early recurrence of atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( ERAF). Compared to patients without ERAF ( no-AF-recurrence group) , baseline hsCRP levels had no significant difference in patients with ERAF ( AF recurrence group). There were no significant differences in the peak hsCRP and hs-cTnT levels between no-AF-recurrence group and AF recurrence group. However , change of hsCRP level was significantly correlated with change in hs-cTnT level in patients undergoing RFCA ( Among those AF patients undergoing ablation , change of hsCRP level could be for the myocardial injury related to RFCA procedure , which may not be a risk factor to predict ERAF. The variety of hsCRP level may be related to the degree of myocardial injury induced by RFCA.
