  Optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters are devices that , when stimulated with light , emit light in proportion to the integrated ionizing radiation dose. The stimulation of optically stimulated luminescent material results in the loss of a small fraction of signal stored within the dosimetric traps. Previous studies have investigated the signal loss due to readout stimulation and the optical annealing of optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters. This study builds on former research by examining the behavior of optically stimulated luminescent signals after annealing , exploring the functionality of a previously developed signal loss model , and comparing uncertainties for dosimeters reused with or without annealing. For a completely annealed dosimeter , the minimum signal level was 56 ± 8 counts , and readings followed a Gaussian distribution. For dosimeters above this signal level , the fractional signal loss due to the reading process has a linear relationship with the calculated signal. At low signal levels ( below 20,000 counts) in this optically stimulated luminescent dosimeter system , calculated signal percent errors increase significantly but otherwise are on average 0.72 ± 0.27 % , 0.40 ± 0.19 % , 0.33 ± 0.12 % , and 0.24 ± 0.07 % for 30 , 75 , 150 , and 300 readings , respectively. Theoretical calculations of uncertainties showed that annealing before reusing dosimeters allows for dose errors below 1 % with as few as 30 readings. Reusing dosimeters multiple times increases the dose errors especially with low numbers of readouts , so theoretically around 300 readings would be necessary to achieve errors around 1 % or below in most scenarios. Note that these dose errors do not include the error associated with the signal-to-dose conversion factor.
