  Concurrence of both endometrial adenocarcinoma and ovarian adult granulosa<pathogen> cell tumor ( aGCT) is believed to be related to high estrogen milieu , but genomic alterations of the concurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma and aGCT are not known. For this , we analyzed an uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma and an ovarian aGCT in a same patient by a targeted next generation sequencing ( NGS). We found a germline mutation in STK11 ( p.L113fs). The endometrial adenocarcinoma harbored FGFR2 and TP53 mutations and the aGCT harbored a FOXL2 ( p.C134 W) mutation. These germline and somatic mutations have been reported in non-concurrent tumors. These two tumors harbored 20 CNAs but only one CNA was exactly overlapped in the tumors. Our findings indicate that the concurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma and aGCT in this patient might not be genetically related to each other at germline or somatic level and suggest that such concurrence might be originated from non-genetic backgrounds including stimulated estrogen milieu.
