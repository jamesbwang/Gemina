  To summarize recent literature on the use of left atrial strain in the diagnosis and management of patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Left atrial dysfunction is a hallmark of diastolic dysfunction and heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , in particular , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF). Recently , myocardial deformation analysis via strain and strain rate measurements have been applied to the left atrium. These measurements have been shown to aid in the diagnosis of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> and be accurate predictors of cardiac pressures , diastolic dysfunction , exercise performance , and clinical outcomes such as cardiac hospitalizations and mortality. However , limitations related to the technical aspect of accurately imaging and tracking the thin-walled left atrium and the current lack of consensus on ` normal ' reference values remain. Left atrial strain represents a novel , noninvasive technique to aid in the diagnosis , prognosis , and management of patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Although it is not yet a part of routine clinical practice , the measurement has significant promise within this population pending further validation.
