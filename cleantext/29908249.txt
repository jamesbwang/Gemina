  Axonal projection is controlled by discrete regions localized at the neuroepithelium , guiding the neurite growth during embryonic development. These regions exert their effect through the expression of a family of chemotropic molecules , which actively participate in the formation of neuronal connections of the central nervous system in vertebrates. Previous studies describe prosomere 1 ( P1) as a possible organizer of axonal growth of the rostral rhombencephalon , contributing to the caudal projection of reticulospinal rhombencephalic neurons. This work studies the contribution of chemotropic signals from P1 or pretectal medial longitudinal fascicle ( MLF) neurons upon the caudal projection of the interstitial nuclei of Cajal ( INC). By using in ovo surgeries , retrograde axonal labeling , and immunohistochemical techniques , we were able to determine that the absence of P1 generates a failure in the INC caudal projection , while drastically diminishing the reticulospinal rhombencephalic neurons projections. The lack of INC projection significantly decreases the number of reticulospinal neurons projecting to the MLF. We found a 48.6 % decrease in the projections to the MLF from the rostral and bulbar areas. Similarly , the observed decrease at prosomere 2 was 51.5 % , with 61.8 % and 32.4 % for prosomeres 3 and 4 , respectively; thus , constituting the most affected rostral regions. These results suggest the following possibilities: i , that the axons of the reticulospinal neurons employ the INC projection as a scaffold , fasciculating with this pioneer projection; and ii , that the P1 region , including pretectal MLF neurons , exerts a chemotropic effect upon the INC caudal projection. Nonetheless the identification of these chemotropic signals is still a pending task.
