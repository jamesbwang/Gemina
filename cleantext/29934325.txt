  The development of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKI) specific for epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGFR) with activating mutations has led to a new paradigm in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) patients. However , most patients eventually develop resistance. Hypoxia is a key microenvironmental stress in solid tumors that is associated with poor prognosis due , in part , to acquired resistance to conventional therapy. This study documents that long-term , moderate hypoxia promotes resistance to the EGFR TKI , gefitinib , in the NSCLC cell line HCC827 , which harbors an activating EGFR mutation. Following hypoxic growth conditions , HCC827 cells treated with gefitinib upregulated N-cadherin , fibronectin , and vimentin expression and downregulated E-cadherin , characteristic of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) , which prior studies have linked to EGFR TKI resistance. Mechanistically , knockdown of the histone demethylases , LSD1 and PLU-1 , prevented and reversed hypoxia-induced gefitinib resistance , with inhibition of the associated EMT , suggesting that LSD1 and PLU-1 play key roles in hypoxia-induced gefitinib resistance and EMT. Moreover , hypoxia-treated HCC827 cells demonstrated more aggressive tumor growth
