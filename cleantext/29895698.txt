  The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCB4/MDR3 is critical for biliary phosphatidylcholine ( PC) excretion at the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. Defective ABCB4 gene expression and protein function result in various cholestatic liver and bile duct injuries. Thyroid hormone receptor ( THR) is a major regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism; we explored its potential role in ABCB4 regulation. Thyroid hormone T3 stimulation to human hepatocyte models showed direct transcriptional activation of ABCB4 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. To determine whether THRβ1 ( the main THR isoform of the liver) is involved in regulation , we tested THRβ1-specific agonists ( e.g. , GC-1 , KB-141); these agonists resulted in greater stimulation than the native hormone. KB-141 activated hepatic ABCB44 expression in mice , which enhanced biliary PC secretion in vivo. We also identified THR response elements 6 kb upstream of the ABCB4 locus that were conserved in humans and mice. Thus , T3-via THRβ1 as a novel transcriptional activator-regulates ABCB4 to increase ABCB4 protein levels at the canalicular membrane and promote PC secretion into bile. These findings may have important implication for understanding thyroid hormone function as a potential modifier of bile duct homeostasis and provide pharmacologic opportunities to improve liver function in hepatobiliary diseases caused by low ABCB4 expression.
