  Leksell GammaPlan was specifically designed for Gamma Knife ( GK) radiosurgery planning , but it has limited accuracy for estimating the dose distribution in inhomogeneous areas , such as the embolization of arteriovenous malformations. We aimed to develop an independent patient dose validation system based on a patient-specific model , constructed using a DICOM-RT interface and the Geant4 toolkit. Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion was designed in Geant4 .10.00 and includes a DICOM-RT interface. Output factors for each collimator in a sector and dose distributions in a spherical water phantom calculated using a Monte Carlo ( MC) algorithm were compared with the output factors calculated by the tissue maximum ratio ( TMR) 10 algorithm and dose distributions measured using film , respectively. Studies using two types of water phantom and two patient simulation cases were evaluated by comparing the dose distributions calculated by the MC , the TMR and the convolution algorithms. The water phantom studies showed that if the beam size is small and the target is located in heterogeneous media , the dose difference could be up to 11 %. In the two patient simulations , the TMR algorithm overestimated the dose by about 4 % of the maximum dose if a complex and large bony structure was located on the beam path , whereas the convolution algorithm showed similar results to those of the MC algorithm. This study demonstrated that the in-house system could accurately verify the patient dose based on full MC simulation and so would be useful for patient cases where the dose differences are suspected.
