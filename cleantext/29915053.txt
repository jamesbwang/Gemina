  Learning the location of relevant places in the environment is crucial for survival. Such capacity is supported by a distributed network comprising the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus , yet it is not fully understood how these structures cooperate during spatial reference memory formation. Hence , we examined neural activity in the prefrontal-hippocampal circuit in mice during acquisition of spatial reference memory. We found that interregional oscillatory coupling increased with learning , specifically in the slow-gamma frequency ( 20 to 40 Hz) band during spatial navigation. In addition , mice used both spatial and nonspatial strategies to navigate and solve the task , yet prefrontal neuronal spiking and oscillatory phase coupling were selectively enhanced in the spatial navigation strategy. Lastly , a representation of the behavioral goal emerged in prefrontal spiking patterns exclusively in the spatial navigation strategy. These results suggest that reference memory formation is supported by enhanced cortical connectivity and evolving prefrontal spiking representations of behavioral goals.
