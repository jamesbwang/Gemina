  By the end of 2017 , 32 ( 68 %) of 47 countries in the World Health Organization 's African Region had introduced rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine into their national immunization programs , including 27 countries that received financial support from the Gavi , the Vaccine Alliance. Several early introducing African countries previously evaluated the impact , vaccine effectiveness , and/or cost effectiveness of their routine rotavirus<pathogen> vaccination programs and found that rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine was effective and resulted in substantial declines in hospitalizations due to rotavirus<pathogen>. This Special Issue of Vaccine provides additional rotavirus<pathogen> vaccine effectiveness and impact data from a broader range of African countries , describes the longer term impact and potential indirect benefits of rotavirus<pathogen> vaccination programs , describes trends in circulating genotypes in the pre- and post-vaccine introduction eras , and evaluates the cost-effectiveness of a rotavirus<pathogen> vaccination program in a post-introduction setting. As countries begin transitioning from Gavi support , the findings of these studies provide evidence of the impact and effectiveness of rotavirus<pathogen> vaccination programs under conditions of routine use.
