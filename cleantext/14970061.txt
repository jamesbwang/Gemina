  The immune system plays a major role in cancer surveillance. Harnessing its power to treat many cancers is now a reality that has led to cures in hopeless situations where no other solutions were available from traditional anticancer drugs. These spectacular achievements rekindled the oncology community 's interest in extending the benefits to all cancers including breast cancer. The first section of this article reviews the biological foundations of the immune response to different subtypes of breast cancer and the ways cancer may overcome the immune attack leading to cancer disease. The second section is dedicated to the actual immune treatments including breast cancer vaccines , checkpoint inhibitors , monoclonal antibodies , and the `` unconventional '' immune role of chemotherapy.
