  Pericardial diseases are relatively common in clinical practice and encountered in various clinical settings with consequent significant morbidity and mortality. However , the diagnosis as well as management can be complex and challenging , as the clinical presentation is usually non-specific. Therefore , there is an increasing role for cardiac magnetic resonance Imaging ( CMR) as an imaging tool to facilitate the diagnosis of pericardial diseases. Herein we describe conventional and unique CMR approaches to provide an increased non-invasive understanding of the pericardium in health and disease including a novel method to diagnose constrictive pericarditis<disease> via radio-frequency tissue tagging by defining unique visceral-parietal adherence patterns easily learned by the cardiologist and radiologist.
