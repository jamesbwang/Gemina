  The Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling of phenyl esters and alkyl boranes is disclosed. Two reaction modes are rendered accessible in a selective fashion by interchange of the catalyst. With a Pd-NHC system , alkyl ketones can be prepared in good yields via a Suzuki-Miyaura reaction proceeding by activation of the C ( acyl)- O bond. Use of a Pd-dcype catalyst enables alkylated arenes to be synthesized by a modified pathway with extrusion of CO.. Applications of this divergent coupling strategy and the origin of the switchable selectivity are discussed.
