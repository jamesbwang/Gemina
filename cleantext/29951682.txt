  Three similar Mannich base ligands viz.. N,N-bis ( 3,5-dimethyl-2-hydroxybenzyl)- N ' , N '- dimethyl-1,3-diaminopropane ( H2L1) , N,N-bis ( 3,5-dimethyl-2-hydroxybenzyl)- N ' , N '- dimethyl-1,2-diaminoethane ( H2L2) and N,N-bis ( 3,5-dimethyl-2-hydroxybenzyl)- N ' , N '- diethyl-1,2-diaminoethane ( H2L3) upon reaction with Cu ( CH3COO) 2 · H2O produced dinuclear complexes ( Cu2L21-3). The reaction of each of these isolated dimeric species with Cu ( ClO4) 2 · 6H2O and NaN3 resulted in three new trinuclear complexes , ( ( CuL1) 2 ( μ1,1-N3) 2Cu ( H2O)) · CH3OH ( 1) , ( ( CuL2) 2 ( μ1,1-N3) 2Cu ( H2O)) · CH3OH ( 2) and ( ( CuL3) 2 ( μ1,1-N3) 2Cu ( H2O)) · 2CH3OH ( 3) , respectively. The complexes ( 1-3) have been characterized by elemental analysis and single crystal X-ray diffraction. In all three complexes , the central Cu ( ii) ion is coordinated by two terminal ( CuL) units through a phenoxido and an azido bridge. These are the first trinuclear Cu ( ii) complexes of this type of Mannich base ligands. Magnetic susceptibility measurements showed intramolecular antiferromagnetic interactions with J = -64.42 , -9.60 and -4.54 cm-1 for 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively. All three complexes exhibited catecholase-like and phenoxazinone synthase-like activities towards the aerobic oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol and o-aminophenol , respectively. The turnover numbers ( kcat) for the aerobic oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol are 568.8 , 542.1 and 500.4 h-1 and those of o-aminophenol are 125.83 , 118.9 and 114.7 h-1 for complexes 1-3 , respectively. The X-band EPR spectroscopy and estimation of the produced hydrogen peroxide indicated that the aerobic oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol proceeded through the formation of a semiquinonate radical. The mechanism of phenoxazinone synthase-like activities is also proposed for trinuclear Cu ( ii) catalysts with the help of mass spectral analysis.
