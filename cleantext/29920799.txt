  Thin-film photovoltaics ( PV) have emerged as a technology that can meet the growing demands for efficient and low-cost large-scale cells. However , the photoabsorbers currently in use contain expensive or toxic elements , and the difficulty in bipolar doping , particularly in a device structure , requires elaborate optimization of the heterostructures for improving the efficiency. This study shows that bipolar doping with high hole and electron mobilities in copper nitride ( Cu
