  Immunomodulator ( IM)- based monotherapy with thiopurines or methotrexate is being increasingly supplanted in the management of moderate-to-severe IBD by more efficacious biologic agents. However , given their low cost , IMs may still have a selective role in this setting. We used a Canadian population-based dataset of persons with IBD spanning from 1996 until 2014 to assess the initiation and continued use of IM monotherapy , the incidence of outcomes associated with ineffectiveness ( defined as IBD-related hospitalization , IBD-resective surgery , systemic corticosteroid ( CS) use , or the need for biologic therapy) , and the demographic and disease-related characteristics associated with persistence on IM monotherapy and IBD-associated adverse outcomes. There were 3312 persons diagnosed with IBD ( 1480 CD , 1832 ulcerative colitis<disease> ( UC)) in the study period. The cumulative incidence of IM monotherapy use at 5 years was 46 % for CD and 24.9 % for UC. Approximately one-third remained on IM monotherapy continuously for 5 years or more. Roughly three-quarters of IM users with a history of corticosteroid use had at least a 50 % reduction in corticosteroid exposure in the year following IM initiation. Thirty-five percent of those with CD and 30 % with UC had not developed evidence of therapeutic ineffectiveness within 5 years of IM initiation; people with no history of prior corticosteroid use , no IBD hospitalizations , and persons with CD initiating IM therapy after age 40 were less likely to have an episode of therapeutic ineffectiveness while on IM monotherapy CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of persons who are initiated on IM monotherapy discontinue medications and/or have evidence of therapeutic ineffectiveness a significant minority remain free of these outcomes over many years of therapy.
