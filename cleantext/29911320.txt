  Previously published studies evaluating a recombinant Der f 2-based immunotherapy have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of dogs experimentally and naturally sensitized to house dust mites ( HDM). Der f 2 sensitization is thought to play a minor role in European atopic dogs sensitized to HDM. The study evaluated the short-term efficacy of a recombinant Der f 2 product in the treatment of naturally sensitized atopic dogs in Switzerland and Hungary. Fifteen atopic dogs with positive test reactions to Dermatophagoides farinae ( Df). Recombinant Der f 2 allergens were injected subcutaneously at increasing doses once weekly for 6 weeks. Canine Atopic Dermatitis<disease> Extent and Severity Index ( CADESI-04) , pruritus Visual Analog Scale ( pVAS) and medication scores were assessed at days 0 and 42. Efficacy was recorded as excellent , good , fair or poor , depending on the number of scores decreasing by more than 50 %. Mean CADESI , pVAS and medication scores at inclusion were 35 , 6 and 15 ( SD = 30 , 2 , 7) , respectively. At Day 42 the scores decreased to 8 , 3 and 5 , respectively ( Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank tests P = 0.0002 , 0.002 and 0.001). Four dogs were classified as excellent responders with a reduction of > 50 % in all three scores. Nine dogs were classified as good ( five) or fair ( four) responders and scores deteriorated in two dogs. These data suggest that recombinant Der f2 allergens may be as effective and show benefit faster than traditional allergen immunotherapy in European dogs sensitized to Df.
