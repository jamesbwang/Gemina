  Durable polymer drug-eluting stents ( DP DES) may contribute to persistent inflammation<symptom> , delayed endothelial healing and subsequent late DES thrombosis. The aim of this Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT) sub-study was to compare healing and neointimal coverage of a novel bioabsorbable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent ( FIREHAWK ®) ( BP DES) versus the DP DES ( XIENCE) at 90 days in an all comers patient population. The TARGET All Comers study is a prospective multicenter randomised post-market trial of 1656 patients randomised 1:1 to FIREHAWK or XIENCE at 21 centers in 10 European countries. The TARGET OCT sub-study enrolled 36 consecutive patients with 52 lesions<symptom> at 6 centers proficient in OCT.. Follow-up OCT was performed at 3 months or prior to revascularisation when occurring before the 3-month window. The substudy was designed for non-inferiority of the primary endpoint of neointimal thickness. At follow-up , the mean neointimal thickness by OCT ( 52 lesions<symptom> , Firehawk , n = 24; Xience , n = 28) , was not significantly different between groups ( Firehawk 75.5 μm vs Xience V 82.3 μm) meeting the primary endpoint of non-inferiority ( Pnoninferiority < 0.001). The percentage of stent strut coverage was high in both groups ( strut level: 99.9 % ± 0.3 vs 100 % ± 0.1 , p = 0.26) , and the proportion of malapposed struts ( 1.0 ± 1.6 % vs. 1.2 ± 2.0 % , p = 0.51) was low in both groups. Based on OCT , the FIREHAWK BP DES has a similar healing response 3 months after implantation compared to the DP DES , with near complete strut coverage , moderate neointima formation and minimal strut malapposition.
