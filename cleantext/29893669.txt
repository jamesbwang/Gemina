  The mitral valve plasty ( MVP) technique for degenerative disease is typically leaflet resection and suturing. However , this technique is time consuming and unreproducible. To overcome this disadvantage , we developed a nonresectional folding technique , which is fast and reproducible. In this report , we examine our new folding technique in robotic MVP. The new folding technique was performed in 10 patients ( age 56 ± 15 years) , and the conventional resection and suturing ( RS) technique was performed in 22 patients ( age 53 ± 8 years). In our new folding technique , we used two sutures to fold the prolapsed leaflet to the left ventricle side. The first folding suture line is a land mark , and the second line adjusts the height of the posterior leaflet to the anterior leaflet so that sufficient coaptation depth can be obtained. MVP was successful in all patients. In the folding technique group , the operation time , cardiopulmonary bypass time , and cross clamp time was faster than the conventional RS technique group ( 188 ± 31 , 97 ± 32 , and 55 ± 3 min , versus 242 ± 51 , 137 ± 25 , and 70 ± 15 min; P < .05). Hospital stays were significantly shorter in the folding technique group ( 13 ± 2 days versus 17 ± 7 days; P < .05). All patients were discharged without complications. The post-echocardiography revealed no mitral valve regurgitation in any patient. The new folding technique facilitated efficient MVP for posterior leaflet prolapse in mitral valve regurgitation , without the need for the resection of the leaflet.
