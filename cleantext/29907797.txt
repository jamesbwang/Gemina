  Sixty to seventy-five percent of individuals with rare and undiagnosed phenotypes remain undiagnosed after exome sequencing ( ES). With standard ES reanalysis resolving 10-15 % of the ES negatives , further approaches are necessary to maximize diagnoses in these individuals. In 38 ES negative patients an individualized genomic-phenotypic approach was employed utilizing ( 1) phenotyping; ( 2) reanalyses of FASTQ files , with innovative bioinformatics; ( 3) targeted molecular testing; ( 4) genome sequencing ( GS); and ( 5) conferring of clinical diagnoses when pathognomonic clinical findings occurred. Certain and highly likely diagnoses were made in 18/38 ( 47 %) individuals , including identifying two new developmental disorders. The majority of diagnoses ( > 70 %) were due to our bioinformatics , phenotyping , and targeted testing identifying variants that were undetected or not prioritized on prior ES. GS diagnosed 3/18 individuals with structural variants not amenable to ES. Additionally , tentative diagnoses were made in 3 ( 8 %) , and in 5 individuals ( 13 %) candidate genes were identified. Overall , diagnoses/potential leads were identified in 26/38 ( 68 %). Our comprehensive approach to ES negatives maximizes the ES and clinical data for both diagnoses and candidate gene identification , without GS in the majority. This iterative approach is cost-effective and is pertinent to the current conundrum of ES negatives.
