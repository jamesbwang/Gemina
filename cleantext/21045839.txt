  Food quality control is a mandatory task in the food industry and relies on the availability of simple , cost-effective and stable sensing platforms. In the present work , the applicability of bare glassy carbon electrodes for routine analysis of food samples was evaluated as a valid alternative to chromatographic techniques , using caffeine as test analyte. A number of experimental parameters were optimized and a differential pulse voltammetry was applied for quantification experiments. The detection limit was found to be 2 Ã— 10
