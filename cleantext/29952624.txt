  The `` law of practice ''- a simple nonlinear function describing the relationship between mean response time ( RT) and practice-has provided a practically and theoretically useful way of quantifying the speed-up that characterizes skill acquisition. Early work favored a power law , but this was shown to be an artifact of biases caused by averaging over participants who are individually better described by an exponential law. However , both power and exponential functions make the strong assumption that the speedup always proceeds at a steadily decreasing rate , even though there are sometimes clear exceptions. We propose a new law that can both accommodate an initial delay resulting in a slower-faster-slower rate of learning , with either power or exponential forms as limiting cases , and which can account for not only mean RT but also the effect of practice on the entire distribution of RT.. We evaluate this proposal with data from a broad array of tasks using hierarchical Bayesian modeling , which pools data across participants while minimizing averaging artifacts , and using inference procedures that take into account differences in flexibility among laws. In a clear majority of paradigms our results supported a delayed exponential law. ( PsycINFO Database Record
