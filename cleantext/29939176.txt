  Screening for protein-protein interactions using the yeast 2-hybrid assay has long been an effective tool , but its use has largely been limited to the discovery of high-affinity interactors that are highly enriched in the library of interacting candidates. In a traditional format , the yeast 2-hybrid assay can yield too many colonies to analyze when conducted at low stringency where low affinity interactors might be found. Moreover , without a comprehensive and complete interrogation of the same library against different bait plasmids , a comparative analysis can not be achieved. Although some of these problems can be addressed using arrayed prey libraries , the cost and infrastructure required to operate such screens can be prohibitive. As an alternative , we have adapted the yeast 2-hybrid assay to simultaneously uncover dozens of transient and static protein interactions within a single screen utilizing a strategy termed DEEPN ( Dynamic Enrichment for Evaluation of Protein Networks) , which incorporates high-throughput DNA sequencing and computation to follow the evolution of a population of plasmids that encode interacting partners. Here , we describe customized reagents and protocols that allow a DEEPN screen to be executed easily and cost-effectively.
