  Although prenatal alcohol exposure ( PAE) reduces offspring growth , it may increase obesity risk at adolescence. Animal models of PAE display glucose intolerance and increased adiposity , suggesting that PAE causes metabolic reprogramming. We tested this hypothesis in a mouse model of binge PAE , wherein pregnant C57Bl/6J females received 3 g/kg alcohol ( ETOH) daily from gestational day 12.5 to 17.5; maltodextrin ( MD) and medium chain triglycerides ( MCT) served as isocaloric nutritional controls , and sham ( H2O) treatment controlled for gavage stress. Our comprehensive assessment quantified body composition , energy expenditure , glucose tolerance , and cardiovascular function in offspring at age 17 weeks. Although ETOH pups were initially lighter than all other groups , they did not have a unique obesogenic phenotype. Instead , a similar obesogenic phenotype emerged in all three caloric groups ( MCT , MD , ETOH) , such that caloric groups had greater post-weaning weight gain ( both sexes) , reduced gonadal fat weight ( males) , and reduced glucose clearance ( males) compared against H2O offspring. PAE did not affect body composition , respiratory exchange ratio , metabolic adaption to high-fat or low-fat diet , eating behavior , and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , and ETOH values did not differ from those obtained from isocaloric controls. Exposure to a higher alcohol dose ( 4.5 g/kg) or a high-fat ( 60 %) diet did not exacerbate differences in body composition or glucose tolerance. `` PAE-specific '' effects on postnatal growth , glucose tolerance , adiposity , or hypertension only emerged when PAE offspring were compared just against H2O controls , or against MD controls. We conclude that prior reports of obesity and glucose intolerance in adult PAE offspring reflect the contribution of added gestational calories , and not alcohol 's pharmacologic action. Results suggest that the increased adiposity risk in FASD is not caused by metabolic reprogramming , and instead originates from behavioral , medication , and/or dietary practices. This study highlights the importance of appropriate dietary controls in nutritional studies of PAE.
