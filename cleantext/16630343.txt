  Factor modeling is an essential tool for exploring intrinsic dependence structures among high-dimensional random variables. Much progress has been made for estimating the covariance matrix from a high-dimensional factor model. However , the blessing of dimensionality has not yet been fully embraced in the literature: much of the available data are often ignored in constructing covariance matrix estimates. If our goal is to accurately estimate a covariance matrix of a set of targeted variables , shall we employ additional data , which are beyond the variables of interest , in the estimation? In this article , we provide sufficient conditions for an affirmative answer , and further quantify its gain in terms of Fisher information and convergence rate. In fact , even an oracle-like result ( as if all the factors were known) can be achieved when a sufficiently large number of variables is used. The idea of using data as much as possible brings computational challenges. A divide-and-conquer algorithm is thus proposed to alleviate the computational burden , and also shown not to sacrifice any statistical accuracy in comparison with a pooled analysis. Simulation studies further confirm our advocacy for the use of full data , and demonstrate the effectiveness of the above algorithm. Our proposal is applied to a microarray data example that shows empirical benefits of using more data. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.
