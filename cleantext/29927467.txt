  To report the association of angioid streaks in patients with Pseudoxanthoma elasticum ( PXE) with reticular pseudodrusen ( RPD) , thin choroid , and retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE) atrophy using swept-source optical coherence tomography ( SS-OCT) and short-wave autofluorescence ( SWAF). Retrospective cross-sectional study. Records of consecutive patients with angioid streaks due to PXE , who presented with a decrease of vision due to choroidal neovascularization ( CNV) , were reviewed for best-corrected visual acuity , color fundus photographs , SS-OCT , SWAF , and red-free images with special emphasis on presence or absence of RPD , subfoveal choroidal thickness ( SFCT) , and RPE atrophy. Sixteen eyes of eight patients with a mean age of 45.5 years ± 9.4 years were enrolled in the study. RPD were seen in 10 of the 16 eyes and were seen commonly along the superotemporal quadrant<symptom>. Mean subfoveal thickness in study eyes ( 175.7 μm ± 37.2 μm) was significantly reduced when compared to controls ( 286.4 μm ± 40.8 μm). The mean SFCT was similar between the eyes with and without CNV. Four eyes had RPE atrophy in the macular area , whereas four eyes had peripapillary RPE atrophy. Angioid streaks in PXE are associated with RPD , thin choroid , and RPE atrophy. These features occur at a younger age as compared to age-related macular degeneration and appear to be interrelated because of single pathophysiological mechanism.
