  In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM) aging has proved protective against sudden death ( SD) risk and aggressive recommendations for prophylactic ICDs are uncommon in patients ≥ 60 years. Nevertheless , we present a patient with an unexpected but aborted sudden death event at the advanced age of 71 years due to a left ventricular apical aneurysm<disease> ( LVAA) which has emerged as a novel SD marker. Subsequent reappraisal of the Tufts HCM database , specifically the 118 LVAA patients , showed that 36 % of SD events occurred at ≥ 60 years. Of HCM patients ≥ 60 years , SD was 8-fold more common with aneurysm<disease> than without aneurysms<disease> ( 16 % vs 2 %; P < 0.001). Risk in HCM with LVAA persists throughout life and senior LVAA patients should also be considered for primary prevention of SD with the ICD.
