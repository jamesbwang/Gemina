  Reverse turns are solvent-exposed motifs in proteins that are crucial in nucleating β-sheets and drive the protein folding. The solvent-exposed nature makes reverse turns more amenable to chemical modifications than α-helices or β-sheets towards modulating the stability of re-engineered proteins. Here , we utilize van der Waals repulsive forces in tuning the steric restraint at the reverse turn. The steric restraint induced upon
