  We present here a numerical study dedicated to the fluidization of a submerged granular medium induced by a localized fluid injection. To this end , a two-dimensional ( 2D) model is used , coupling the lattice Boltzmann method ( LBM) with the discrete element method ( DEM) for a relevant description of fluid-grains interaction. An extensive investigation has been carried out to analyze the respective influences of the different parameters of our configuration , both geometrical ( bed height , grain diameter , injection width) and physical ( fluid viscosity , buoyancy). Compared to previous experimental works , the same qualitative features are recovered as regards the general phenomenology including transitory phase , stationary states , and hysteretic behavior. We also present quantitative findings about transient fluidization , for which several dimensionless quantities and scaling laws are proposed , and about the influence of the injection width , from localized to homogeneous fluidization. Finally , the impact of the present 2D geometry is discussed , by comparison to the real three-dimensional ( 3D) experiments , as well as the crucial role of the prevailing hydrodynamic regime within the expanding cavity , quantified through a cavity Reynolds number , that can presumably explain some substantial differences observed regarding upward expansion process of the fluidized zone when the fluid viscosity is changed.
