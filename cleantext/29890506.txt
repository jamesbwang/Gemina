  New findings identified the MORC1 gene as a link between early life stress and major depression<symptom> In this study , MORC1 methylation was investigated in 60 healthy human adults ( 30 women , 30 men) between 19 and 33 years of age. For analysis , DNA was isolated from buccal cells. The results show that DNA methylation in the MORC1 promoter region significantly correlates with the Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory score in the examined non-clinical population. Sum score of birth complications , however , seems to correlate negatively with methylation. These findings further confirm that MORC1 is a stress sensitive gene and a possible biomarker for
