  Lanthanide ( Ln3 +)- doped NaREF4 ( RE = rare earth) nanocrystals ( NCs) are one of the most widely studied upconversion and downshifting luminescent nanoprobes. However , the size and optical performance of the Ln3 +- doped NaREF4 NCs produced by the available lab-scale synthesis may vary from batch to batch , which inevitably limits their practical bioapplications. Herein , we report the synthesis of uniform Ln3 +- doped NaREF4 NCs via a facile solid-liquid-thermal-decomposition ( SLTD) method by directly employing NaHF2 powder as a fluoride and sodium precursor. The proposed SLTD strategy is easy to perform , time-saving and cost-effective , making it ideal for scale-up syntheses. Particularly , over 63 g of Î²-NaGdF4: Yb , Er@NaYF4 core/shell NCs with narrow size variation ( < 7 %) were synthesized via a one-pot reaction. By virtue of their superior upconversion and downshifting luminescence , we employed the synthesized core/shell nanoprobes for the in vitro detection of prostate-specific antigen with a limit of detection down to 1.8 ng mL-1 , and for in vivo near-infrared imaging with a high signal-to-noise ratio of 12. These findings may pave the way for the commercialization of Ln3 +- doped nanoprobes in bioassay kits for versatile clinical applications.
