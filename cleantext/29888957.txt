  Analysis of Lamiaceae essential oils ( EOs) by GC-FID-MS revealed the presence as the major constituents of linalool ( 16.8 %) , linalyl acetate ( 15.7 %) in Lavandula angustifolia , menthol ( 29.0 %) , menthone ( 22.7 %) , menthyl acetate ( 19.2 %) in Mentha x piperita , terpinen-4-ol ( 27.1 %) , ( E)- sabinene hydrate ( 12.1 %) , γ-terpinene ( 10.0 %) in Origanum majorana , α-thujone ( 19.5 %) , camphor ( 19.0 %) , viridiflorol ( 13.5 %) in Salvia officinalis , thymol ( 61.9 %) , p-cymene ( 10.0 %) , γ-terpinene ( 10.0 %) in Thymus vulgaris<pathogen>. Based on the MIC and MBC values ( 0.09-0.78 mg/mL) and ratio MBC/MIC showed that EO from T. vulgaris<pathogen> ( TO) had the strong inhibitory and bactericidal effect against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> The bacterial cells were total killed by TO at 2MIC concentration after 6 h. The higher concentrations of other EOs were needed to achieve bactericidal effects. The strong bactericidal effect of TO against these bacteria indicates the possibility of topical use of TO but it requires research under clinical conditions.
