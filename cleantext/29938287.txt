  Inspired by nature , scientists have been engaged in developing deformable artificial systems. Here , we propose an innovative method to realize controllable deformations using asymmetric bubble hydrogel microfibers produced by microfluidic cascaded coaxial devices. Asymmetric geometries , coupled with the mismatched shrinkage ratio , contribute to deformations upon dehydration<symptom> The dynamic process can be controlled by regulating bubble sizes , distances and packing modes. Various 4D structures have been constructed. Combined with the 3D printing technique , this proof-of-concept study may open new avenues for bio-engineering and beyond.
