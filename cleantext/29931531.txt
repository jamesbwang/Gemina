  The sternalis muscle is an infrequent , non-pathological anatomical variant typically misrepresented in a clinical context. It presents with 3-8 % prevalence , according to cadaveric studies. The muscles were identified during routine cadaver prosection at the School of Anatomical Sciences , University of the Witwatersrand. Here , we report two cases of the sternalis muscle in two South African White cadavers. Analysis of the sternalis muscles revealed unilaterally present , distinctly defined muscle masses on the right ( case number 1 , female) and left ( case number 2 , male) hemithorax , lateral to the sternum. The muscles occurred with a prevalence of 2.25 % within the cadaveric population examined. The prevalence of the sternalis muscle is generally low , especially in the European population. Their presence represents the remnants of the cutaneous muscles in the ventral thorax of lower animals. Clinically , the sternalis muscle may be misinterpreted as a pathological mass or lesion<symptom> , thus accurate knowledge regarding its variations and prevalence is of importance.
