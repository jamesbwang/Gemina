  To investigate the relationship between SLC22A12 gene rs1529909 and rs7929627 polymorphism and hyperuricemia of residents in Yinchuan , Ningxia province. Through retrospective analysis in healthy subjects from April to November in 2014 , 365 patients with hyperuricemia were selected. 1 ∶ 1 matched casecontrol study was carried out , matched with age ( ± 5 years old) , gender , race , and selected 365 people with normal serum uric acid levels as the control group. All subjects were investigated by questionnaire , had a physical examination , and collected fastingvenous blood for biochemical markers and gene polymorphism detection. Paired t test was used to compare the mean of two samples , and the influencing factors were analyzed by conditional logistic regression. The interaction of two sites on hyperuricemia was analyzed by MDR software. The body mass index , blood uric acid , creatinine , total cholesterol and triglyceride in the case group were higher than those in the control group , the difference was statistically significant ( P < 0. 05). There was a significant differences between male cases and control group in the allele frequency of rs1529909 ( χ ~ 2 = 4. 887 , P = 0. 027). There had a significant difference in the frequency of rs7929627 between the Hui case and control group ( χ ~ 2 = 14. 906 , P = 0. 002) , also a significant difference between the male case and control group ( χ ~ 2 = 9. 749 , P = 0. 021). Additionally , theresult of interaction analysis showed that the distribution of high risk and low risk genotype had a statistically significant difference ( χ ~ 2 = 8. 338 , P = 0. 004). The risk of hyperuricemia with high genotype was 1. 536 times of those who had low-risk genotypes ( OR = 1. 536 , 95 % CI1. 147-2. 057). rs1529909 and rs7929627 were associated with hyperuricemia among men. rs7929627 was related to it in the Hui. There may be a strong antagonistic effect on hyperuricemia between rs1529909 and rs7929627.
