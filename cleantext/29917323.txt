  Scheffersomyces stipitis , renowned for its native xylose-utilizing capacity , has recently demonstrated its potential in producing health-promoting shikimate pathway derivatives. However , its broader application is hampered by the low transformation efficiency and the lack of genetic engineering tools to enable sophisticated genomic manipulations. S. stipitis employs the predominant non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ) mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks ( DSB) , which is less desired due to its incompetence in achieving precise genome editing. Using CRISPR technology , here a ku70Δku80Δ deficient strain in which homologous recombination ( HR)- based genome editing appeared dominant for the first time in S. stipitis is constructed. To build all essential tools for efficiently manipulating this highly promising nonconventional microbial host , the gene knockdown tool is also established , and repression efficiency is improved by incorporating a transcriptional repressor Mxi1 into the CRISPR-dCas9 platform. All these results are obtained with the improved transformation efficiency , which is 191-fold higher than that obtained with the traditional parameters used in yeast transformation. This work paves the way for advancing a new microbial chassis and provides a guideline for developing efficient CRISPR tools in other nonconventional yeasts.
