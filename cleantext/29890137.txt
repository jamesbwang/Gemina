  Pluripotent embryonic stem cells are one of the best modalities for the disease treatment due to their potential for self-renewal and differentiation into various cell types. Induction of stem cell differentiation into specific cell lineages has been investigated for decades , especially in vitro neuronal differentiation of embryonic stem cells. However , in vitro differentiation methods do not yield sufficient amounts of neurons for use in the therapeutic treatment of neurological disorders. Here , we provide an improved neuronal differentiation method based on a combination of small regulatory molecules for specific signaling pathways ( FGF4 for FGF signaling , SB431542 for Nodal/Smad signaling , and XAV939 and BIO for Wnt signaling) in N2B27 media. We found that FGF4 was required for neural induction , SB431542 accelerated neural precursor differentiation , and treatment with XAV939 and BIO at different periods enhanced neuronal differentiation. These optimized neuronal differentiation conditions may allow a greater neuron cell yield within a shorter time than current methods and be the basis for treatment of neurological<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> using stem cells.
