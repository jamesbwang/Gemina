  To identify the role of a subpopulation of neurons in behavior , it is essential to test the consequences of blocking its activity in living animals. Laser ablation of neurons is an effective method for this purpose when neurons are selectively labeled with fluorescent probes. In the present study , protocols for laser ablating a subpopulation of neurons using a two-photon microscope and testing of its functional and behavioral consequences are described. In this study , prey capture behavior in zebrafish larvae is used as a study model. The pretecto-hypothalamic circuit is known to underlie this visually-driven prey catching behavior. Zebrafish pretectum were laser-ablated , and neuronal activity in the inferior lobe of the hypothalamus ( ILH; the target of the pretectal projection) was examined. Prey capture behavior after pretectal ablation was also tested.
