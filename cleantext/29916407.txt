  Many studies have described perfectionism and low self-esteem as traits associated with eating disorders ( ED). More recently , research has shown the role played by worry , rumination , control and metacognitive beliefs. This paper investigates the role played by cognitive and metacognitive variables in the psychopathological mechanism of eating disorders , assuming that not only perfectionism and low selfesteem but also metacognitive beliefs and processes can discriminate between controls and EDs. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM , the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale , the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale , the Anxiety<symptom> Control Questionnaire , the Penn State Worry and the Metacognition Questionnaire were administered to the samples. Results suggested that metacognitive factors like negative beliefs about worry , uncontrollability and danger , need for control , and worry should be added to the body of cognitive factors underlying ED composed by the classical couple of cognitive factors including perfectionism and low self-esteem. It is possible that an individual with ED assumes that metacognitive processes like worry and rumination are a further proof of his or her lack of value , capacity to control , and self-control. Such appraisals may reinforce the painful sense of low self-esteem so typical in ED and , in turn , the perfectionistic striving for excellence.
