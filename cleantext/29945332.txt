  Our previous studies revealed that concentrations of circulating antibodies to annexin A1 ( ANXA1) were increased in non-small lung cancer ( NSCLC). This study was thus designed to replicate this initial finding with an independent sample set. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) was developed in-house to examine plasma antiANXA1 IgG levels in 220 patients with NSCLC and 200 control subjects. Mann-Whitney U test showed that patients with NSCLC had significantly higher anti-ANXA1 IgG levels than control subjects ( Z = -4.02 , p < 0.001); male patients appeared to mainly contribute to the increased antibody level ( Z = -3.09 , p = 0.002). Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis showed an overall area under the ROC curve ( AUC) of 0.61 ( 95 % CI: 0.56- 0.67) , with sensitivity of 8 % against a specificity of 95.0 %. Spearman 's correlation analysis failed to show a significant correlation between the anti-ANXA1 IgG levels and the expression of three tumor-associated antigens including p53 ( r = 0.156 , p = 0.027) , Ki67 ( r = -0.048 , p = 0.489) , and EGFR ( r = 0.02 , p = 0.782). Increased levels of circulating anti-ANXA1 IgG antibody may have a prognostic value for NSCLC.
