  Soft tissue sarcomas<disease> represent a heterogeneous group of rare malignancies exhibiting mesenchymal differentiation with an overall incidence of around 5/100 ,000/ year. Rarity and morphologic heterogeneity significantly affect diagnostic accuracy; therefore , expertise can be achieved only through access to large number of cases. Soft tissue sarcomas<disease> are currently classified on the basis of the 2013 WHO classification of soft tissue tumors that integrate conventional morphology with immunohistochemistry and molecular genetics. The morphologic diagnosis of sarcoma<disease> relies on the evaluation as well as the integration of four main features: the shape of the neoplastic cells; the pattern of growth; the quality of the background; the architecture of the vascular network. Immunohistochemical characterization plays a key role in the diagnostic workup of soft tissue sarcomas<disease>. The majority of classic differentiation markers tend to show good sensitivity , however , associated with rather limited specificity , making interpretation in context with morphology mandatory. Molecular genetics is increasingly used for diagnostic purposes to distinguish specific subtypes of sarcomas<disease> , to support diagnosis in non-canonical clinical presentations and also to distinguish true sarcomas<disease> from benign mimickers. With many exceptions , histologic typing does not provide sufficient information for predicting the clinical course of the disease and , therefore , grading systems based on histological parameters were introduced to provide a more accurate estimation of the degree of malignancy of tumors. The three-tiered system devised by the French Federation of Cancer Centers Sarcoma Group ( FNCLCC) systems is widely adopted; however , several limitations exist that have led to the development of prognostic nomograms that incorporate the specific histotype as one of the relevant parameters.
