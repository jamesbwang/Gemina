  Introduction Breast cancer has a high prevalence in the community and places very high demands on resources. Digital mammography provides a good quality image with reduced radiation dose and can detect breast carcinoma in its earlier stages , resulting in good prognosis and improved patient survival. Objective To calculate the diagnostic accuracy of digital mammography in the detection of breast cancer , using histopathology as a gold standard in women aged over 30 years , who are undergoing mammography for screening and diagnostic purposes. Materials and methods This was a cross-sectional analytical study , conducted in the department of radiology , for a total duration of 10 months. A total of 122 patients of age above 30 years , referred for digital mammography for the evaluation of different symptoms related to breast diseases , followed by biopsy/surgery and histopathology , were included in the study. Result Our data confirmed that digital mammography is a highly accurate tool for breast cancer detection having a sensitivity of 97 % , a specificity of 64.5 % , a positive predictive value of 89 % , and a negative predictive value of 90.9 % , with a diagnostic accuracy of 89.3 %. Conclusion Considering our results , we recommend that digital mammography should replace screen-film mammography as a basic tool to detect breast cancer for both screening and diagnostic purposes.
