  We assessed short- and mid-long-term clinical efficacy of transanal irrigation ( TAI) and its effect on the quality of life of children with spina bifida ( SB) and anorectal malformations ( ARM). Seventy-four pediatric patients ( age 6-17 years) with SB and ARM with neurogenic bowel dysfunction were enrolled for a prospective and multicentric study. Patients were evaluated before the beginning of TAI ( T0) , after 3 months ( T1) and after at least 2 years ( range 24-32 months) ( T2) using a questionnaire assessing bowel function , the Bristol scale , and two validated questionnaires on quality of life: the CHQ-PF50 questionnaire for the parents of patients aged 6-11 years and the SF36 questionnaires for patients aged between 12 and 18 years. Seventy-two patients completed TAI program in T1 , and 67 continued into T2. Bowel outcomes ( constipation<symptom> and fecal incontinence) improved in both the SB and the ARM groups in the short and mid-long term. In both groups at T1 and T2 , parents and children reported an improvement in quality of life and there was a significant increase of stool<symptom> form types 4 and 5 as described by the Bristol scale. Common adverse effects during the study were similar at T1 and T2 without serious complications. We observed a sustained improvement in bowel management and quality of life in SB and ARM children during the study , more significant in the short term than in mid-long term. To maintain success rates in the mid-long term and to reduce the dropout rate , we propose patient training and careful follow-ups.
