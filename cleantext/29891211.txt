  To evaluate clinical and physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> in moose to thiafentanil administration for immobilization. Cross-sectional clinical study. Eleven ( six males and five females) free-ranging adult moose ( Alces alces). Each moose was darted from a helicopter with 7.5 mg thiafentanil during March 2014 in northern Sweden. Physiological evaluation included vital signs and blood gases. Arterial blood was collected after induction and again after 10 minutes of intranasal oxygen administration and analyzed immediately with an i-STAT analyzer. A total of 10 mg naltrexone per milligram of thiafentanil was administered to all animals for reversal. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. All moose were sufficiently immobilized with a single dart injection. Induction occurred within 3 minutes in 10 of 11 moose. One individual became recumbent while crossing a river and naltrexone was immediately administered. Animals maintained sternal recumbency<symptom> with their head raised and vital signs were stable. Nine of 10 moose were hypoxemic before oxygen administration , with seven becoming markedly hypoxemic ( partial pressure of arterial oxygen ( PaO Thiafentanil provided rapid and sufficient immobilization of moose and its effects were rapidly reversed with naltrexone. As with other opioids , moose showed hypoxemia<symptom> and varying degrees of respiratory and metabolic acidosis. Arterial oxygenation of moose improved following intranasal oxygen , but hypoxemia<symptom> was not fully resolved despite therapy. Thiafentanil ( 7.5 mg per adult is effective for immobilization of free-ranging moose. Supplemental oxygen may be of benefit when using this regimen; however , further investigation is required to confirm these results.
