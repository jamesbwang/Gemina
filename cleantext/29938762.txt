  Thanks to the introduction of new methods to induce massive damage under controlled conditions , much information about regeneration in Drosophila imaginal discs has accumulated in recent years. In this review , we discuss results concerning primarily the wing disc , putting emphasis on the different regenerative responses of the wing appendage , which exhibits a robust regenerative potential , and the trunk region , the notum , which regenerates very poorly. The wing disc may be a paradigm of a tissue in which a common original lineage generates cells with distinct regenerative potential. We argue that a key factor in those differences is the activity of the Jun N-terminal Kinase ( JNK) pathway , which functions differently in the appendage and the body trunk.
