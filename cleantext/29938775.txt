  The incidence of basal cell carcinoma ( BCC) is increasing and the costs for care rising. Therefore the need of simplified and cost-effective treatment choices is substantial. Aberrant signalling in several pathways , induced by UV-radiation , is of importance in the development of BCC. Alterations in tumour metabolic activity are part of general carcinogenesis , however only partially recognized in skin cancer. To study expression profiles in BCCs compared to individually matched non-tumour skin , with focus on finding differences associated to tumour metabolism. Gene expression in biopsies from BCC ( n = 14) compared to biopsies from non- tumour gluteal skin was analysed with microarray ( n = 4 + 4) and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR , n = 14 + 14). Protein expression and localisation was assessed using immunohistochemistry ( IHC) in formalin fixed and paraffin embedded BCC. Microarray analysis revealed increased expression of the amino acid transporters SLC7A5 , SLC7A7 and SLC7A8 as well as the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase ( TDO) 2 in BCC. Higher expression of SLC7A5 ( P < 0.0001) , SLC7A8 ( P < 0.0001) and TDO2 ( P = 0.0017) , but not SLC7A7 ( P = 0.50) , wasconfirmed by qPCR and IHC demonstrated correlating tumour cell protein expression of SLC7A5 and SLC7A8. Protein expression of SLC7A7 was observed in stratum granulosum<pathogen> and TDO2 in immune cells. This study highlights the upregulation of SLC7A5 , SLC7A8 and TDO2 in BCC compared to non-tumour skin. Our findings imply that amino acid transporters may be further explored as potential targets for future medical treatment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
