  Light-emitting electrochemical cells ( LEECs) from ionic transition-metal complexes ( iTMCs) offer the potential for high-efficiency electroluminescence in a simple , single-layer device. However , LEECs typically rely on the use of rare metal complexes. This has limited their cost effectiveness and put constraints on their applicability. With a view to leveraging the efficient emission of these complexes while mitigating costs , we describe here a host/guest LEEC strategy that relies on the use of carbazole ( Cz)- based organic small-molecule hosts and iTMC guests. Three cationic host molecules were prepared via the coupling of 1- ( 4-bromophenyl) -2-phenylbenzimidazole ( PBI-Br) with Cz. This has allowed a comparison between the hosts bearing methoxy ( PBI-CzOMe) and tert-butyl ( PBI-Cz tBu) substituents , as well as an unsubstituted analogue ( PBI-CzH). Cyclic voltammetry and UV-visible absorption revealed that all three host materials have wide band gaps characterized by reversible oxidation and irreversible reduction events. On the basis of electronic structure calculations , the host highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO) resides primarily on the Cz moiety , whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( LUMO) is located primarily on the phenyl-benzimidazolium unit. Photoluminescence analysis of thin-film blends of PBI-CzH with iTMC guests confirmed that the emission was blue-shifted relative to pristine iTMC films , which is consistent with what was seen in dilute dichloromethane solution. LEEC devices were prepared based on thin films of the pristine hosts , pristine guests , and 90 %/ 10 % ( w/w) host/guest blends. Among these host/guest blends , LEECs based on PBI-CzH displayed the best performance , particularly when an iridium complex was used as the guest. The system in question yielded a luminance maximum of 624 cd/m
