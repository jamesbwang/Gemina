  For maltose fermentation , budding yeast Saccharomyces<pathogen> cerevisiae<pathogen> operates a mechanism that involves transporters ( MALT) , maltases ( MALS) and regulators ( MALR) collectively known as MAL genes. However , functional relevance of MAL genes during sake brewing process remains largely elusive , since sake yeast is cultured under glucose-rich condition achieved by the co-culture partner Aspergillus<pathogen> spp.. Here we isolated an ethyl methane sulfonate ( EMS)- mutagenized sake yeast strain exhibiting enhanced maltose fermentation compared to the parental strain. The mutant carried a single nucleotide insertion that leads to the extension of the C-terminal region of a previously uncharacterized MALR gene YPR196W-2 , which was renamed as MAL73. Introduction of the mutant allele MAL73L with extended C-terminal region into the parental or other sake yeast strains enhanced the growth rate when fed with maltose as the sole carbon source. In contrast , disruption of endogenous MAL73 in the sake yeasts decreased the maltose fermentation ability of sake yeast , confirming that the original MAL73 functions as a MALR. Importantly , the MAL73L-expressing strain fermented more maltose in practical condition compared to the parental strain during sake brewing process. Our data show that MAL73 ( L) is a novel MALR gene that regulates maltose fermentation , and has been functionally attenuated in sake yeast by single nucleotide deletion during breeding history. Since the MAL73L-expressing strain showed enhanced ability of maltose fermentation , MAL73L might also be a valuable tool for enhancing maltose fermentation in yeast in general.
