  Integrity in the pursuit of discovery through application of the scientific method and reporting the results is an obligation for each of us as scientists. We can not let the value of science be diminished because discovering knowledge is vital to understand ourselves and our impacts on the earth. We support the value of science by our stewardship of integrity in the conduct , training , reporting , and proposing of scientific investigation. The players who have these responsibilities are authors , reviewers , editors , and readers. Each role has to be played with vigilance for ethical behavior , including compliance with regulations for protections of study subjects , use of select agents and biohazards , regulations of use of stem cells , resource sharing , posting datasets to public repositories , etc.. The positive take-home message is that the scientific community is taking steps in behavior to protect the integrity of science. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
