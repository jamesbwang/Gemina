  Two novel wide-band gap donor-acceptor-type conjugated copolymers , PTzBI-S and PTzBI-Ph , are designed and synthesized , based on alkylthio-thienyl- or alkylphenyl-substituted benzodithiophene ( BDT) derivatives as the electron-donating unit and pyrrolo ( 3,4- f) benzotriazole-5,7 ( 6 H)- dione as the electron-withdrawing unit. The as-generated copolymers show the comparable optical and electrochemical properties. The alkylthio-thienyl-substituted BDT unit facilities a benign decrease of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( HOMO) levels. This consequently enhances open-circuit voltages ( V
