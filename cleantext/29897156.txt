  To investigate the impact of continent urinary diversion on readmissions and hospital costs in a nationally representative sample of radical cystectomies ( RCs) performed in the USA. The 2010-2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried for patients with a diagnosis of bladder cancer who underwent RC. We identified patients undergoing continent ( neobladder or continent cutaneous reservoir) or incontinent ( ileal conduit) diversions. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of 90-day readmission , prolonged length of stay , and total hospital costs. Amongst 21 126 patients identified , 19 437 ( 92.0 %) underwent incontinent diversion and 1 689 ( 8.0 %) had a continent diversion created. Continent diversion patients were younger , healthier , and treated at high-volume metropolitan centres. Continent diversions resulted in fewer in-hospital complications ( 37.3 % vs 42.5 % , P = 0.02) but led to more 90-day readmissions ( 46.5 % vs 39.6 % , P = 0.004). In addition , continent diversion patients were more often readmitted for infectious complications ( 38.7 % vs 29.4 % , P = 0.004) and genitourinary complications ( 18.5 % vs 13.0 % , P = 0.01). On multivariable logistic regression , patients with a continent diversion were more likely to be readmitted within 90 days ( odds ratio ( OR) 1.55 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI): 1.28 , 1.88) and have increased hospital costs during initial hospitalisation ( OR 1.99 , 95 % CI: 1.52 , 2.61). Continent diversion led to a $ 4 617 ( American dollars) increase in initial hospital costs ( $ 36 640 vs $ 32 023 , P < 0.001) , which was maintained at 30 days ( $ 48 621 vs $ 44 231 , P < 0.001) and at 90 days ( $ 56 380 vs $ 52 820 , P < 0.001). In a nationally representative sample of RCs performed in the USA , continent urinary diversion led to more frequent readmissions and increased hospital costs. Interventions designed to address specific outpatient issues with continent diversions can potentially lead to a significant decrease in readmissions and associated hospital costs.
