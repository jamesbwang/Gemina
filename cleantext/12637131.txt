  Biomarkers improving risk prediction for elderly populations with chronic kidney disease ( CKD) , an independent predictor of mortality , could be particularly useful. We previously observed that interleukin-6 ( IL-6) , D-dimer and soluble vascular adhesion molecule ( s-VCAM) were independent biomarkers of mortality in elderly individuals. Therefore , we investigated whether these established biomarkers were independently associated with both estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) and mortality. The Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly ( EPESE) is a longitudinal cohort of community-dwelling elderly individuals. We investigated the association among eGFR , the biomarkers ( IL-6 , D-dimer and s-VCAM) and 4-year all-cause mortality using restricted cubic splines within Cox proportional hazards models. Among 1907 participants in EPESE , 1342 had available creatinine and biomarker measures. Incidence of all-cause mortality was 21.6 %. eGFR was associated with all-cause mortality ( P < 0.01); individuals at the lowest ( < 30 mL/min/1 .73 m In community-dwelling elderly individuals , we observed an association among eGFR , 4-year mortality and IL-6 , D-dimer and s-VCAM. eGFR was independently associated with mortality , and the relation between eGFR and mortality was modified by IL-6 , D-dimer and s-VCAM , which was most notable in individuals with severely reduced eGFR. These findings suggest that IL-6 , D-dimer and s-VCAM may be useful biomarkers for improving risk prediction , but further studies are needed examining the role of these biomarkers in elderly individuals with CKD.
