  Erosive tooth wear is defined as irreversible loss of dental tissues due to intrinsic or extrinsic acids , exacerbated by mechanical forces. Recent studies have suggested a higher prevalence of erosive tooth wear in males , as well as a genetic contribution to susceptibility to erosive tooth wear. Our aim was to examine erosive tooth wear by performing a genome-wide association study ( GWAS) in a sample of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 ( n = 1,962). Erosive tooth wear was assessed clinically using the basic erosive wear examination. A GWAS was performed for the whole sample as well as separately for males and females. We identified one genome-wide significant signal ( rs11681214) in the GWAS of the whole sample near the genes PXDN and MYT1L. When the sample was stratified by sex , the strongest genome-wide significant signals were observed in or near the genes FGFR1 , C8orf86 , CDH4 , SCD5 , F2R , and ING1. Additionally , multiple suggestive association signals were detected in all GWASs performed. Many of the signals were in or near the genes putatively related to oral environment or tooth development , and some were near the regions considered to be associated with dental<disease> caries<disease> , such as 2p24 , 4q21 , and 13q33. Replications of these associations in other samples , as well as experimental studies to determine the biological functions of associated genetic variants , are needed.
