  Central diabetes insipidus ( CDI) is a rare disorder in children. The aetiology of CDI in childhood is heterogeneous. The aim of this study is to illustrate the importance of a careful clinical and neuro-radiological follow-up of the pituitary and hypothalamus region in order to identify the aetiology and the development of associated hormonal deficiencies. Clinical and auxological variables of 15 children diagnosed with CDI were retrospectively analysed in a paediatric hospital. Evaluations of adenohypophyseal function and cranial MRI were performed periodically. The mean age at diagnosis of CDI was 9.6 years ( range: 1.32-15.9). The aetiological diagnosis could be established initially in 9 of the 15 patients , as 7 with a germinoma and 2 with a histiocytosis. After a mean follow-up of 5.5 years ( range: 1.6-11.8) , the number of idiopathic cases was reduced by half. At the end of the follow-up , the aetiological diagnoses were: 9 germinoma ( 60 %) , 3 histiocytosis ( 20 %) , and 3 idiopathic CDI ( 20 %). There is a statistically significant association between stalk thickening and tumour aetiology. At least one adenohypophyseal hormonal deficiency was found in 67 % of cases , with the majority developing in the first two years of follow-up. Growth hormone deficiency ( 60 %) was the most prevalent. The follow-up of CDI should include hormone evaluation with special attention , due to its frequency , to GH deficiency. In addition , a biannual MRI in an idiopathic CDI should be performed , at least during the first 2-3 years after diagnosis , as 50 % of them were diagnosed with a germinoma or histiocytosis during this period.
