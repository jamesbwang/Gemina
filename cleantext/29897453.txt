  Serum concentrations of liver enzymes and the hepatokine fetuin-A have been linked to the risk of type 2 diabetes , but their longitudinal impact on insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction is unclear. To evaluate the impact of changes over 2 years in fetuin-A and the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) , and γ-glutamyltransferase ( GGT) on changes in insulin sensitivity , β-cell function , and glycemia in women with varying degrees of previous gestational dysglycemia , reflecting a range of future diabetic risk. In total , 336 women underwent glucose challenge test ( GCT) and oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT) in pregnancy , followed by repeat OGTT and measurement of ALT/AST/GGT/ fetuin-A at both 1 year and 3 years postpartum. The antepartum GCT/OGTT identified four gestational glucose tolerance groups: gestational diabetes ( n = 104) , gestational impaired glucose tolerance ( n = 59) , abnormal GCT with normal OGTT ( n = 98) , and normal GCT/OGTT ( n = 75). At 1 and 3 years postpartum , ALT , AST , GGT , and fetuin-A did not differ across the four groups , but the intervening change in ALT/AST ratio was greater in the gestational dysglycemia groups ( P = 0.05). Higher baseline ALT/AST ( t = -1.99 , P = 0.05) and fetuin-A ( t = -3.17 , P = 0.002) predicted lower insulin sensitivity ( Matsuda) at 3 years , as did their respective changes from 1 to 3 years ( ALT/AST: t = -5.47 , P < 0.0001; fetuin-A: t = -3.56 , P = 0.0004). Change in ALT/AST predicted lower β-cell function ( t = -2.33 , P = 0.02) and higher fasting glucose at 3 years ( t = 2.55 , P = 0.01). Moreover , baseline fetuin-A predicted prediabetes/diabetes at 3 years ( OR , 1.38; 95 % CI , 1.01 to 1.88). Circulating hepatic markers , particularly ALT/AST ratio and fetuin-A , track with changes in insulin sensitivity and β-cell function , supporting a pathophysiologic basis in their prediction of diabetic risk.
