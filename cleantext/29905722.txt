  We demonstrate the integration of paper fluidics with mid-infrared ( MIR) chalcogenide waveguides to introduce liquid samples to the waveguide evanescent field for analysis. Spectroscopy of model analytes ( water and isopropyl alcohol) having well-defined mid-IR absorptions , on a ZnSe rib waveguide fabricated on silicon , is demonstrated in the wavelength range of 2.6-3.7 Âµm , showing their O-H and C-H stretching absorptions. The results are compared with a theoretical waveguide model , achieving good agreement. It is concluded that the presence of paper in the evanescent field does not interfere with the waveguide measurements , opening up opportunities to combine low-cost paper-based fluidics and integrated photonic technologies.
