  Cardiac myxomas are benign tumors of endocardial origin that usually occur in the left atrium. Trans-thoracic echocardiography is the diagnostic method of choice , and early surgical removal is the preferred method of treatment. We present a patient whose history of cerebral emboli and central retinal artery occlusion ( CRAO) led to a diagnosis of cardiac myxoma. Neuroimaging studies showed multiple infarcts in the region of the left middle and anterior cerebral arteries. Ophthalmic examination showed gross retinal pallor compatible with left central retinal artery occlusion ( CRAO). The etiology of stroke was investigated by performing trans-thoracic echocardiography , which showed a mass in the left atrium compatible with cardiac myxoma. Complete removal of the cardiac tumor was performed by open-heart surgery. Fortunately , after a period of rehabilitation , the patient 's hemiparesis<symptom> almost completely resolved , but the loss of vision OS remained unchanged. Many cases of myxoma are accompanied by constitutional symptoms , such as anemia<symptom> , fever<symptom> and weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , which allow for a diagnosis to made before serious complications such as embolism occur. Unfortunately , in some patients , such as ours , the absence of signs and symptoms allows the myxoma to pass completely unnoticed until the first embolic event occurs.
