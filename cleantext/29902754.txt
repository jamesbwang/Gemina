  A dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction ( DLLME) method , combined with HPLC-UV detection , was developed for the extraction and preconcentration of δ-tocopherol from bovine milk. This method was used to study the effect of supplementing cow feed with the seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum on vitamin content in milk. The optimal experimental conditions were determined: 200 μL of chloroform ( extraction solvent) , 1.0 mL of ethanol ( dispersive solvent) , 5 mL of water ( aqueous phase). Under these optimal conditions the DLLME method provided linearity in the range 0.01 μg/mL to 8 μg/mL with R
