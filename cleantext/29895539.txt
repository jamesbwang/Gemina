  Blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) control in the early phase of stroke is controversial to reduce the risk of poststroke cognitive impairment ( PSCI). This study was to investigate the impact of BP levels in the early phase of ischemic stroke and stroke subtype on PSCI. Seven hundred and ninety-six patients with acute ischemic stroke were included. Cognitive function was assessed after stroke onset using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Patients were divided into quintiles according to systolic BP and diastolic BP levels in the early phase. Subtype analyses were according to Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification ( infarct cause) and Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification ( infarct location). After adjusting for multiple variables , the quintiles with the lowest systolic BP ( Q1 , 102-127 mm Hg) and with the highest systolic BP ( Q5 , 171-215 mm Hg) were associated with increased PSCI risk ( odds ratio , 1.83; 95 % confidence interval , 1.64-2.28; Lower or higher BP in the early phase of ischemic stroke was correlated with increased PSCI risk at 3 months. Maintaining systolic/diastolic BP in the levels of 143 to 158/93 to 102 mm Hg might be beneficial to reduce the occurrence of PSCI. Moreover , large artery atherosclerosis subtype and total anterior circulation infarct subtype were correlated with increased PSCI risk at 3 months. URL: https://www.chictr.org.
