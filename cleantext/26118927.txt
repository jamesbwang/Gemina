  Nephronophthisis ( NPH) is an autosomal recessive form of cystic kidney disease and the leading cause of hereditary kidney failure in children and young adults. Like other NPH proteins , the NPHP16/Anks6-interacting protein Anks3 has been identified to cause laterality defects in humans. However , the cellular functions of Anks3 remain enigmatic. We investigated the metabolic impact of Anks3 depletion in cultured murine inner medullary collecting duct cells via GC-MS profiling and LC-MS/MS analysis. Combined metabolomics successfully identified 155 metabolites; 48 metabolites were identified to be significantly altered by decreasing Anks3 levels. Especially , amino acid and purine/pyrimidine metabolism were affected by loss of Anks3. Branched-chain amino acids were identified to be significantly downregulated suggesting disrupted nutrient signalling. Tryptophan and 1-ribosyl-imidazolenicotinamide accumulated whereas NAD
