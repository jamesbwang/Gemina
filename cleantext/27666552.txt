  LC-3 and P62 , two of important autophagy-related proteins , were reported highly expressed in many kinds of human malignancies and associated with outcomes of the patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression status of LC-3 and P62 in non-small cell lung cancer patients and define the clinical-pathologic features. 66 cases of non-small cell lung cancer patients were employed. The expression of LC-3 and P62 were detected by immunohistochemistry. LC-3 was positive stained in 27 out of 66 cases ( 40.9 %) and P62 was positive stained in 43 out of 66 cases ( 65.2 %). LC-3 positive staining was more frequently in squamous cell carcinoma patients ( P < 0.05); while P62 positive staining was more frequently in late-stage adenocarcinoma patients with metastasis ( P < 0.05). There was a significant negative correlation between LC-3 and P62 expressions in non-small cell lung cancer tissues ( rs = -0.065 , P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with positive LC-3 expression had favorable clinical outcomes compared with the patients with negative LC-3 expression ( P < 0.05). LC-3 and P62 showed abnormal expression in non-small cell lung cancer tissues , suggesting that autophagy is involved in the occurrence and development of NSCLC.
