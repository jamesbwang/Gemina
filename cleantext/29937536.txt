  Allicin is considered responsible for most of the pharmacological activity of crushed raw garlic cloves. However , when garlic supplements and garlic foods are consumed , allicin bioavailability or bioequivalence ( ABB) has been unknown and in question because allicin formation from alliin and garlic alliinase usually occurs after consumption , under enzyme-inhibiting gastrointestinal conditions. The ABB from 13 garlic supplements and 9 garlic foods was determined by bioassay for 13 subjects by comparing the area under the 32-h concentration curve of breath allyl methyl sulfide ( AMS) , the main breath metabolite of allicin , to the area found after consuming a control ( 100 % ABB) of known allicin content: homogenized raw garlic. For enteric tablets , ABB varied from 36 ⁻ 104 % , but it was reduced to 22 ⁻ 57 % when consumed with a high-protein meal , due to slower gastric emptying. Independent of meal type , non-enteric tablets gave high ABB ( 80 ⁻ 111 %) , while garlic powder capsules gave 26 ⁻ 109 %. Kwai garlic powder tablets , which have been used in a large number of clinical trials , gave 80 % ABB , validating it as representing raw garlic in those trials. ABB did not vary with alliinase activity , indicating that only a minimum level of activity is required. Enteric tablets ( high-protein meal) disintegrated slower in women than men. The ABB of supplements was compared to that predicted in vitro by the dissolution test in the United States Pharmacopeia ( USP); only partial agreement was found. Cooked or acidified garlic foods , which have no alliinase activity , gave higher ABB than expected: boiled ( 16 %) , roasted ( 30 %) , pickled ( 19 %) , and acid-minced ( 66 %). Black garlic gave 5 %. The mechanism for the higher than expected ABB for alliinase-inhibited garlic was explored; the results for an alliin-free/allicin-free extract indicate a partial role for the enhanced metabolism of & gamma;- glutamyl
