  Humans are the only natural host of both Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV) and Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus<pathogen> ( KSHV) , and this strict host tropism has hampered the development of animal models of these human gammaherpesviruses. To overcome this difficulty and develop useful models for these viruses , three main approaches have been employed: first , experimental infection of laboratory animals ( mainly new-world non-human primates ( NHPs)) with EBV or KSHV; second , experimental infection of NHPs ( mainly old-world NHPs) with EBV- or KSHV-related gammaherpesviruses inherent to respective NHPs; and third , experimental infection of humanized mice , i.e. , immunodeficient mice engrafted with functional human cells or tissues ( mainly human immune system components) with EBV or KSHV. These models have recapitulated diseases caused by human gammaherpesviruses , their asymptomatic persistent infections , as well as both innate and adaptive immune responses to them , facilitating the development of novel therapeutic and prophylactic measures against these viruses.
