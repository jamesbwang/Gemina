  Wideband excitation and control of Fano resonance and electromagnetically induced transparency ( EIT) , both of which rely on coherent interaction between two excitation paths , is challenging. It requires precise control and tuning of interacting resonances or coupling between different resonant structures over a wide frequency range. Gain ( Stokes) and absorption ( anti-Stokes) resonances associated with the stimulated Brillouin scattering ( SBS) process can be excited and controlled over a wide frequency range by tuning the pump frequency , its power and profile. We exploit coherent interaction between the Brillouin Stokes and anti-Stokes resonance , in radio frequency domain , to demonstrate Fano and EIT-like resonance over a wide frequency range and control their shape and strength optically and electrically. For the Fano resonance , the asymmetry and polarity are electrically controlled over an unprecedented frequency range ( 100 MHz-43 GHz) by varying the bias to the intensity modulator whereas , the strength is varied by tuning the Brillouin pump power and/or the bias. The depth and 3 dB linewidth of the transparency window in the EIT-like resonance are controlled using pump and probe parameters. The flexibility of the SBS process that allows wideband electrical and optical control of Fano and EIT-like resonance opens up the potential for applications that range from low-power switching , sensing to tunable RF delay.
