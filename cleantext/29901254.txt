  A wait and see approach for desmoid tumors ( DT) has become part of the routine treatment strategy. However , predictive factors to select the risk of progressive disease are still lacking. A translational project was run in order to identify genomic signatures in patients enrolled within an Italian prospective observational study. Among 12 DT patients ( ten CTNNB1-mutated and two WT) enrolled from our Institution only two patients ( 17 %) showed a progressive disease. Tumor biopsies were collected for whole exome sequencing. Overall , DT exhibited low somatic sequence mutation rate and no additional recurrent mutation was found. In the two WT cases , two novel alterations were detected: a complex deletion of APC and a pathogenic mutation of LAMTOR2. Focusing on WT DT subtype , deep sequencing of CTNNB1 , APC and LAMTOR2 was conducted on a retrospective series of 11 WT DT using a targeted approach. No other mutation of LAMTOR2 was detected , while APC was mutated in two cases. Low-frequency ( mean reads of 16 %) CTNNB1 mutations were discovered in five samples ( 45 %) and two novel intra-genic deletions in CTNNB1 were detected in two cases. Both deletions and low frequency mutations of CTNNB1 were highly expressed. In conclusion , a minority of DT is WT for either CTNNB1 , APC or any other gene involved in the WNT pathway. In this subgroup novel and hard to be detected molecular alterations in APC and CTNNB1 were discovered , contributing to explain a portion of the allegedly WT DT cases.
