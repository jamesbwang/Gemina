  There is a paucity of robust evidence on prevention and management of diabetic foot ulcers<disease> ( DFUs) to inform treatment. This study appraises the current quality of the evidence addressing diagnosis , prognosis , and management of peripheral artery disease ( PAD) in patients with DFUs using a newly devised 21 point scoring ( TOPS) disease specific research appraisal tool published by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot ( IWGDF) and European Wound Management Association. The 2015 IWGDF guidance on diagnosis , prognosis , and management of PAD in patients with DFUs was used to identify studies pertaining to prevention and management. Two reviewers assessed these articles against TOPS , which examines study design , conduct , and outcome reporting. The overall median score was 8 ( 3-12/21). The median design total score was 2 ( 0-4/11). The median conduct total score was 2 ( 1-4/6). The median outcomes total score was 3 ( 1-4/4). There was improvement with time in overall total ( Spearman Rho 0.39 , p = .0005) , design total ( 0.35 , p = .0023) , and outcomes total ( 0.35 , p = .0002) , but not conduct total ( -0.03 , p = .8132) scores. Although this analysis revealed an improvement over time in the overall calibre of studies , the present quality remains poor on which to inform the diagnosis , management , and prognosis of patients with PAD and diabetic foot ulceration.
