  The overproduction of MMPs ( matrix metalloproteinases) and members of the ADAMTS ( a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) protein family plays an important role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis ( OA). The potential of selective MMPs or ADAMTS inhibitors as chemopreventive agents for OA has been demonstrated in several studies. In this study , we investigated the protective effects of emodin ( 1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthaquinone) , isolated from the root of Rheum palmatum L. , in the inhibition of MMP and ADAMTS expression in both rat chondrocytes and an animal model of OA. The expression of MMP-3 , MMP-13 , ADAMTS-4 , ADAMTS-5 , aggrecan , and collagen II mRNA and protein in interleukin-1beta ( IL-1β)- induced rat chondrocytes was followed by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. The activation of the NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin pathways by IL-1β was assessed by western blot. The in vivo effects of emodin were evaluated by intra-articular injection in rats in an experimental model of OA induced by anterior cruciate ligament transection. Emodin dose-dependently down-regulated the expression of MMP-3 , MMP-13 , ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 at both the mRNA and protein level in IL-1β-stimulated rat chondrocytes. In addition , the IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB and Wnt signals was attenuated by emodin , as determined by western blotting. The intra-articular injection of emodin in a rat OA model ameliorated OA progression , as determined in morphological and histological analyses in vivo. Taken together , our findings demonstrate that emodin is a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of OA.
