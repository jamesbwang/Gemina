  Long intergenic noncoding RNAs ( lincRNAs) have been recognized in recent years as key regulators of biological processes. However , lincRNAs in goat remain poorly characterized both across various tissues and during different developmental stages in goat ( Capra hircus). We performed the genome-wide discovery of the lincRNAs in goat by combining the RNA-seq dataset that were generated from 28 cashmere goat skin samples and the 12 datasets of goat tissues downloaded from the NCBI database. We identified a total of 5546 potential lincRNA transcripts that overlapped 3641 lincRNA genes. These lincRNAs exhibited a tissue-specific pattern. Specifically , there are 584 lincRNAs expressed exclusively in only one tissue , and 91 were highly expressed in hair follicle ( HF). In addition , 2350 protein-coding genes and 492 lincRNAs were differentially expressed in the skin of goat. The majority exhibited the remarkable differential expression during the transition of the goat skin from the May-June to August-October time point , which covered the different seasons. Fundamental biological processes , such as skin development , were significantly enriched in these genes. Furthermore , we identified several lincRNAs highly expressed in the HF , which exhibited not only the co-expression pattern with the key factors to the HF development but also the activated expression in the August to October time point. Intriguingly , one of spatiotemporal lincRNAs , linc-chig1598 could be a potential regulator of distal-less homeobox 3 expression during the secondary hair follicle growth. This study will facilitate future studies aimed at unravelling the function of lincRNAs in hair follicle development.
