  This study examines the relationship between social support ( from parents and peers) and cigarette use , through the mediating effect of smartphone dependence , among adolescents. Prospective cohort study. A survey , conducted among 472 adolescents ( average age = 16.2 years) attending classes in 3 schools in Lille , France , provides the data. The theoretical model features social support ( parental and peer) and cigarette use , with smartphone dependence as a mediator , such that the authors simultaneously examine direct ( support → cigarette use) and indirect ( eg , peer support → smartphone dependence → cigarette use) paths. The results illustrate that both parental support and peer support discourage cigarette use , but the indirect effect through smartphone dependence is positive. That is , smartphone dependence mediates the relationship between peer support and cigarette use. Parental support and peer support shape adolescents ' cigarette use and smartphone dependence differently , depending on the adolescents ' gender. Policy makers should acknowledge the positive effects of social support , the negative effect of smartphone dependence , and the importance of gender when developing anti-smoking policies and campaigns.
