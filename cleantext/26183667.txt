  Parasites of fishes have been shown to be effective bioindicators of the aquatic environment. Few investigations have been conducted on ectoparasite models and therefore little is known about the fate of trace elements and metals which they accumulate. In this study trace element sequestration was observed in the carapace of the fish louse , Argulus japonicus<pathogen> and found to relate to the sex of the parasite , as well as , the degree of sclerotization of the carapace. Adults of A.<pathogen> japonicus<pathogen> were collected from cyprinid hosts in the Vaal Dam , South Africa. Parasites were removed and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen before being sectioned with a cryomicrotome. Sections and whole mounts of parasites were prepared and treated with Phen-Green TM FL cell-permeant diacetate. Cryosections were assessed for trace elements and metals using a scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy. Results indicated that in both male and female parasites , trace elements become bound to the carapace and produce more intense fluorescence than in soft tissues. Sexual dimorphic differences were further observed between male and female parasites. The intensity of the fluorescence signals was greater in the carapace of male parasites than in females , particularly when comparing the carapace of the ventral side of the thorax. In females , an amorphous layer of material surrounding the eggs was observed and produced an intense fluorescent signal. Levels of trace elements and metals detected were not significantly different between male and female parasites. Results observed serve as a demonstration for the first time of trace element sequestration in a freshwater crustacean parasite and possible mechanisms employed to reduce body burdens of trace elements and metals.
