  The World Health Organization estimates that diabetes prevalence has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 , with type 2 diabetes accounting for more than 90 % of these cases. Furthermore , the prevalence of prediabetes ( impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) is more than 40 % in some countries and is associated with a global rise in obesity. Therefore it is imperative that we develop new approaches to reduce the development of prediabetes and progression to type 2 diabetes. In this review , we explore the gains made over the past decade by focused efforts to improve insulin secretion by the beta cell or insulin sensitivity of target tissues. We also describe multitasking candidates , which could improve both beta cell dysfunction and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Moreover , we highlight provocative findings indicating that additional glucose regulatory tissues , such as the brain , may be key therapeutic targets. Taken together , the promise of these new multi-faceted approaches reinforces the importance of understanding and tackling type 2 diabetes pathogenesis from a multi-tissue perspective.
