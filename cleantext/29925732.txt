  FCP-COMPLEX is a newly developed solution containing fluoride , calcium , and phosphoric acid that has the potential to reinforce caries-affected dentin. This study evaluated the effect of FCP-COMPLEX on micro-tensile bond strength ( µTBS) and acid-challenge at the dentin-adhesive interface. FCP-COMPLEX , 2 % NaF , and distilled water were applied to artificial caries-affected dentin ( ACAD) and the effect on acid-induced damage after resin composite restoration was observed. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure ( XAFS) were used to evaluate tooth morphology. The µTBS test revealed no effect of FCP-COMPLEX either immediately or after 3 months ' storage. The area of acid damage in caries-affected dentin was reduced by FCP-COMPLEX. XAFS analysis revealed that absorbed fluorine on the surface would form CaF
