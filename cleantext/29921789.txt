  Fatty acid ( FA)- stimulated insulin secretion ( FASIS) is reviewed here in contrast to type 2 diabetes etiology , resulting from FA overload , oxidative stress , intermediate hyperinsulinemia , and inflammation<symptom> , all converging into insulin resistance. Focusing on pancreatic islet & beta;- cells , we compare the physiological FA roles with the pathological ones. Considering FAs not as mere amplifiers of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ( GSIS) , but as parallel insulin granule exocytosis inductors , partly independent of the K
