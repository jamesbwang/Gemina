  It is widely accepted that quality improvement ( QI) education should be experiential. Many training programs believe that making QI learning `` hands-on '' through project-based learning will translate into successful learning about QI. However , this pervasive and overly simplistic interpretation of experiential QI learning , and the general lack of empirical exploration of the factors that influence experiential learning processes , may limit the overall impact of project-based learning on educational outcomes.In this Perspective , the authors explore the opportunities afforded by a theoretically informed approach , to deepen understanding of the diverse factors that affect experiential QI learning processes in the clinical learning environment. The authors introduce the theoretical underpinnings of experiential learning more generally , and then draw upon their experiences and data , obtained in organizing and studying QI education activities , to illuminate how sociocultural theories such as Billett 's workplace learning theory , and sociomaterial perspectives such as actor-network theory , can provide valuable lenses for increasing our understanding of the varied individuals , objects , contexts , and their relationships that influence project-based experiential learning. The two theoretically informed approaches that the authors describe are amongst numerous others that can inform a QI education research agenda aimed at optimizing educational processes and outcomes. The authors conclude by highlighting how a theoretically informed QI education research agenda can advance the field of QI education; they then describe strategies for achieving this goal.
