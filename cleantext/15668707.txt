  Colorectal cancer ( CRC) results from the progressive accumulation of multiple genetic and epigenetic aberrations within cells. The progression from colorectal adenoma to carcinoma is caused by three major pathways: Microsatellite instability , chromosomal instability and CpG island<disease> methylator phenotype. A growing body of scientific evidences suggests that CRC is a heterogeneous disease , and genetic characteristics of the tumors determine their prognostic outcome and response to targeted therapies. Early diagnosis and effective targeted therapies based on a current knowledge of the molecular characteristics of CRC are essential to the successful treatment of CRC. Therefore , the present review summarized the current understanding of the molecular characteristics of CRC , and discussed its implications for diagnosis and targeted therapy.
