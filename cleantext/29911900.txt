  Evaluate healthcare costs and utilization of treated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma ( FL) patients. Adults with newly diagnosed DLBCL and FL between 1 January 2008 and 31 October 2015 were identified in the Optum â„¢ claims database. Healthcare costs and utilization were assessed from diagnosis date until end of follow-up. A total of 1267 DLBCL- and 1595 FL-treated patients were identified. Mean per-patient , per-month cost during follow-up was US$ 11,890 for DLBCL and US$ 10,460 for FL.. Healthcare costs and utilization decreased from year 1 to 2 following diagnosis , due to a decrease in chemotherapy services , inpatient admissions and other outpatient services. The economic burden of treated DLBCL and FL is considerable , especially in the first year following diagnosis.
