  Seed dormancy and germination are regulated by complex mechanisms controlled by diverse hormones and environmental cues. Abscisic acid ( ABA) promotes seed dormancy and inhibits seed germination and post-germination growth. Calmodulin ( CaM) signals are involved with the inhibition of ABA during seed germination and seedling growth. In this study , we showed that
