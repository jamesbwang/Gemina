  The neuropeptides orexins are important in regulating the neurobiological systems that respond to stressful stimuli. Furthermore , orexins are known to play a role many of the phenotypes associated with stress-related mental illness such as changes in cognition , sleep-wake states , and appetite<symptom>. Interestingly , orexins are altered in stress-related psychiatric disorders such as Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety<symptom> Disorders. Thus , orexins may be a potential target for treatment of these disorders. In this review , we will focus on what is known about the role of orexins in acute and repeated stress , in stress-induced phenotypes relevant to psychiatric illness in preclinical models , and in stress-related psychiatric illness in humans. We will also briefly discuss how orexins may contribute to sex differences in the stress response and subsequent phenotypes relevant to mental health , as many stress-related psychiatric disorders are twice as prevalent in women.
