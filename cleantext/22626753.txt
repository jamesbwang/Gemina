  Primary cardiac tumors are rare lesions<symptom> with different histological type. We reviewed our 17 years of experience in the surgical treatment and clinical results of primary non-myxoma cardiac tumors. Between July 2000 and February 2017 , 21 patients with primary cardiac tumor were surgically treated in our institution. The tumors were categorized as benign non-myxomas and malignants. Data including the demographic characteristics , details of the tumor histology and grading , cardiac medical and surgical history , surgical procedure of the patients were obtained from the hospital database. Eleven patients were diagnosed with benign non-myxoma tumor ( male/female: 7/4) , ranging in age from 10 days to 74 years ( mean age 30.9 ± 26.5 years). Papillary ﬁbroelastoma was the most frequent type ( 63.6 %). There were two early deaths in benign group ( all were rhabdomyoma) , and mortality rate was 18 %. The mean follow-up period was 69.3 ± 58.7 months ( range , 3 to 178 months). All survivals in benign group were free of tumor-related symptoms and tumor relapses. Ten patients were diagnosed with malignant tumor ( sarcoma/lymphoma: 8/2 , male/female: 3/7) , ranging in age from 14 years to 73 years ( mean age 44.7 ± 18.9 years). Total resection could be done in only three ( 30 %) patients. The mean follow-up period was 18.7 ± 24.8 months ( range , 0-78 months). Six patients died in the first 10 months. Complete resection of the cardiac tumors , whenever possible , is the main goal of surgery. Surgical resection of benign cardiac tumors is safe , usually curative and provides excellent long-term prognosis. On the contrary , malignant cardiac tumors still remain highly lethal.
