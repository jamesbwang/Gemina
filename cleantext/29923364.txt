  The Southeast Asia ( SEA) haze is an annual problem and at its worst could produce respirable particles of concentrations up to 500 μg/m Data from all respiratory admissions in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre ( UKMMC) from 1st January 2014 to 31st December 2015 were collected retrospectively from chart and electronic database. A total of 16 weeks of haze period had been formally dated by the Department of Environment using the definition of weather phenomenon leading to atmospheric visibility of less than 10 km. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to estimate rate ratios and 95 % CI. There were 1968 subjects admitted for respiratory admissions in UKMMC during the study period. Incidence rates per week were significantly different between the two groups with 27.6 ± 9.2 cases per week during the haze versus 15.7 ± 6.7 cases per week during the non-haze period ( P < 0.01). A total of 4 % versus 2 % was admitted to the intensive care unit in the haze and the non-haze groups , respectively ( P = 0.02). The mean ± SD lengths of stay was 12.1 ± 5.2 days; the haze group had a longer stay ( 18.2 ± 9.7 days) compared to the non-haze groups ( 9.7 ± 3.9) ( P < 0.001). The annual SEA haze is associated with increased respiratory admissions.
