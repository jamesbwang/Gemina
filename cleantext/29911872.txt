  A readily accessible and bench-stable water-soluble hypervalent iodine ( III) reagent ( phenyl iodonio) sulfam ate ( PISA) with an I-N bond was synthesized , and its structure was characterized by X-ray crystallography. With PISA , various indoles were synthesized via C-H amination of 2-alkenylanilines involving an aryl migration/intramolecular cyclization cascade with excellent regioselectivity in aqueous CH
