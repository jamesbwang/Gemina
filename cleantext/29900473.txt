  The most limiting factor for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells is the lack of long-term stability under operating conditions. To examine the intrinsic stability of the perovskite film , we investigated the chemical and electronic properties of methylammonium lead triiodide ( CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS). In particular , XPS data were collected under dark conditions , at applied voltage , under illumination , at open circuit , and under operating conditions. In addition , operation in ambient air atmosphere was analysed by XPS. It was observed that the chemical properties of methylammonium lead triiodide change upon illumination under open-circuit condition by formation of metallic lead species and then by conversion into PbI2 due to evaporation of the organic compounds. These changes , however , can be restricted by applying an extraction voltage to the device contacts that will extract the photogenerated charges from the absorber. As these results were obtained in vacuum , i.e. , in an inert atmosphere , experiments prove that the photogenerated charge carriers intrinsically induce changes in chemical and electronic properties if they are not extracted from the absorber. By illuminating CH3NH3PbI3 in ambient air , the metallic lead species react with oxygen and form lead oxides and lead complexes , which passivate the film and remove the in-gap states.
