  Cell migration is strongly influenced by the organization of the surrounding 3-D extracellular matrix. In particular , within fibrous solid tumors , carcinoma cell invasion may be directed by patterns of aligned collagen in the extra-epithelial space. Thus , studying the interactions of heterogeneous populations of cancer cells that include the stem/progenitor-like cancer stem cell subpopulation and aligned collagen networks is critical to our understanding of carcinoma dissemination. Here , we describe a robust method to generate aligned collagen matrices in vitro that mimic in vivo fiber organization. Subsequently , a protocol is presented for seeding aligned matrices with distinct carcinoma cell subpopulations and performing live cell imaging and quantitative analysis of cell migration. Together , the engineered constructs and the imaging techniques laid out here provide a platform to study cancer stem cell migration in 3-D anisotropic collagen with real-time visualization of cellular interactions with the fibrous matrix.
