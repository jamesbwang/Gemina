  Pharmacovigilance education is essential since adverse drug reactions ( ADRs) are a serious health problem and contribute to unnecessary patient burden and hospital admissions. Healthcare professionals have little awareness of pharmacovigilance and ADR reporting , and only few educational interventions had durable effects on this awareness. Our future healthcare providers should therefore acquire an adequate set of pharmacovigilance competencies to rationally prescribe , distribute , and monitor drugs. We investigated the pharmacovigilance and ADR-reporting competencies of healthcare students to identify educational interventions that are effective in promoting pharmacovigilance. The PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane , CINAHL , PsycINFO , and ERIC databases were searched using the terms `` pharmacovigilance , '' `` students , '' and `` education. ''. Twenty-five cross-sectional and 14 intervention studies describing mostly medical and pharmacy students were included. Intentions and attitudes on ADR reporting were overall positive , although most students felt inadequately prepared , missed the training on this topic , and lacked basic knowledge. Although nearly all students observed ADRs during clinical rounds , only a few had actually been involved in reporting an ADR. Educational interventions were predominately lectures , sometimes accompanied by small interactive working groups. Most interventions resulted in a direct increase in knowledge with an unknown long-term effect. Real-life learning initiatives have shown that healthcare students are capable of contributing to patient care while increasing their ADR-reporting skills and knowledge. There is an urgent need to improve and innovate current pharmacovigilance education for undergraduate healthcare students. By offering real-life pharmacovigilance training , students will increase their knowledge and awareness but can also assist current healthcare professionals to meet their pharmacovigilance obligations.
