  Sterol sulfates are widely occurring molecules in marine organisms. Their importance has been so far underestimated although many of these compounds are crucial mediators of physiological and ecological functions in other organisms. Biosynthesis of sterol sulfates is controlled by cytosolic sulfotransferases ( SULTs) , a varied family of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a sulfo residue (- SO
