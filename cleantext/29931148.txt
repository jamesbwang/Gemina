  Anti-pcsk9 ( proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9) monoclonal antibodies ( Mab) are novel , potent lipid-lowering drugs. They demonstrated to improve the lipid profile in high cardiovascular risk patients. Anti-pcsk9 Mab inhibit the targeted LDL-receptor degradation induced by pcsk9 protein and are able to reduce LDL cholesterol ( LDL-C) levels on top of conventional lipid-lowering therapy.Though these drugs proved to be very safe in the short term , little is known about the possible long term effects , due to the short period of their marketing. The genetic low-cholesterol syndromes<disease> ( LCS) represent the natural models of the lipid-lowering anti-PCSK9 therapy , and a valuable opportunity to predict the long term effects of these drugs. By looking at the clinical features of such models we could be able to foresee possible drug-induced side effects. In the present review the correspondences and discordances between the side effects of anti-pcsk9 therapy and the corresponding LCS models will be examined in the attempt to forecast possible long term consequences of these novel lipid lowering agents.
