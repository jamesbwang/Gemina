  A 6-year-old domestic short-haired cat was presented with an acute onset of right cortical encephalopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) performed 4 days after the onset of clinical signs revealed a lesion<symptom> originating from the right frontal sinus with intracranial extension and compression of the right frontal lobe. The lesion<symptom> was T1-weighted hypointense and T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense. Signal voids within the lesion<symptom> were observed on T2 * images , consistent with hemorrhage<symptom>. Peripheral ring enhancement was visible on postcontrast sequences. These features were consistent with a giant hemorrhagic mucocele. To the authors ' knowledge , this is the first report of MRI characteristics of this lesion<symptom> in a cat.
