  The relationship between the HeartMate II left ventricular assist device ( LVAD) position and pump thrombosis has been reported. However , further clinical implications of device position are unknown. This study aimed to investigate optimal device position for better left ventricular ( LV) unloading and patient prognosis. Patients undergoing a ramp test with right heart catheterization after HeartMate II LVAD implantation were enrolled to this study. Device position was quantified from the chest X-ray obtained at the time of the ramp test: ( 1) inflow cannula angle relative to horizontal line , ( 2) pump angle relative to spine , ( 3) pump depth , ( 4) angle between inflow cannula and pump , and ( 5) angle between pump and outflow graft. LV unloading was assessed by pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at set LVAD speed. Fifty-four patients ( 60 years old and 34 male ( 63 %)) were enrolled. Nobody experienced device malfunction during the study period. Increased LV unloading ( i.e. , lower pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) was associated with a narrower inflow cannula angle relative to horizontal line. Inflow cannula angle < 75 Â° was associated with higher 1 year heart<symptom> failure<symptom> readmission-free survival rate ( p < 0.05 , hazards ratio 7.56 ( 95 % confidence interval 2.32-24.7)). In conclusion , HeartMate II LVAD inflow cannula position was associated with LV unloading and patient prognosis. Prospective studies to ensure optimal device positioning and target better clinical outcomes are warranted.
