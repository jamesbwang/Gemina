  A recent report has found that glucose oxidation and the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase ( PDH) are reduced in the chronic stage of the pilocarpine mouse epilepsy model. This is likely caused by increased phosphorylation by PDH kinase of the E1Î± subunit of PDH , downregulating its activity. Inhibition of this phosphorylation has not yet been explored as a possible approach to treat epilepsy. Chronic dichloroacetate ( DCA , 50 and 100 mg/kg/day) treatment was tested in acute<symptom> seizure<symptom> and the chronic pilocarpine models. We also determined the effects on phosphorylation state , activity and protein levels of PDH in the chronic stage of the pilocarpine model. DCA treatment did not increase latencies to seizures<symptom> in the acute flurothyl seizure<symptom> test and was slightly proconvulsant in the 6 Hz test. The latencies to seizures<symptom> in a second-hit flurothyl test were decreased in SE vs. No SE mice in the chronic stage , but were not restored by DCA. In mice that had experienced pilocarpine-induced SE and were in the chronic `` epileptic '' stage of the model , PDH activity was reduced by 65 % compared to `` healthy '' No SE mice. This was partially alleviated with DCA treatment. Also , PDH protein levels were decreased by 37 % and phosphorylation at Ser
