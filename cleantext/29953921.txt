  Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites of the host cells. A commonly accepted view is the requirement of internal membranous structures for various aspects of viral life cycle. Organelles enable favourable intracellular environment for several viruses. However , studies reporting organelle dynamics upon viral<disease> infections<disease> are scant. In this review , we aim to summarize and highlight modulations caused to various organelles upon viral<disease> infection<disease> or expression of its proteins.
