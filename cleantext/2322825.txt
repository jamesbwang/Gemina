  Primary motor ( M1) , primary somatosensory ( S1) and dorsal premotor ( PMd) cortical areas of rhesus monkeys previously have been associated only with sensorimotor control of limb<symptom> movements<symptom>. Here we show that a significant number of neurons in these areas also represent body position and orientation in space. Two rhesus monkeys ( K and M) used a wheelchair controlled by a brain-machine interface ( BMI) to navigate in a room. During this whole-body navigation , the discharge rates of M1 , S1 , and PMd neurons correlated with the two-dimensional ( 2D) room position and the direction of the wheelchair and the monkey head. This place cell-like activity was observed in both monkeys , with 44.6 % and 33.3 % of neurons encoding room position in monkeys K and M , respectively , and the overlapping populations of 41.0 % and 16.0 % neurons encoding head direction. These observations suggest that primary sensorimotor and premotor cortical areas in primates are likely involved in allocentrically representing body position in space during whole-body navigation , which is an unexpected finding given the classical hierarchical model of cortical processing that attributes functional specialization for spatial processing to the hippocampal formation.
