  Aberrant uterine myometrial activities in humans are major health issues. However , the cellular and tissue mechanism ( s) that maintain the uterine myometrium at rest during gestation , and that initiate and maintain long-lasting uterine contractions during delivery are incompletely understood. In this study we construct a computational model for describing the electrical activity ( simple and complex action potentials) , intracellular calcium dynamics and mechanical contractions of isolated uterine myocytes from the pregnant rat. The model reproduces variant types of action potentials- from spikes with a smooth plateau , to spikes with an oscillatory plateau , to bursts of spikes- that are seen during late gestation under different physiological conditions. The effects of the hormones oestradiol ( via reductions in calcium and potassium selective channel conductance) , oxytocin ( via an increase in intracellular calcium release) and the tocolytic nifedipine ( via a block of L-type calcium channels currents) on action potentials and contractions are also reproduced , which quantitatively match to experimental data. All of these results validated the cell model development. In conclusion , the developed model provides a computational platform for further investigations of the ionic mechanism underlying the genesis and control of electrical and mechanical activities in the rat uterine myocytes.
