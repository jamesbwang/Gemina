  During the last decade , improvements in high-throughput sequencing have generated a wealth of genomic data. Functionally interpreting these sequences and finding the biological signals that are hallmarks of gene function and regulation is currently mostly done using automated genome annotation platforms , which mainly rely on integrated machine learning frameworks to identify different functional sites of interest , including splice sites. Splicing is an essential step in the gene regulation process , and the correct identification of splice sites is a major cornerstone in a genome annotation system. In this paper , we present SpliceRover , a predictive deep learning approach that outperforms the state-of-the-art in splice site prediction. SpliceRover uses convolutional neural networks ( CNNs) , which have been shown to obtain cutting edge performance on a wide variety of prediction tasks. We adapted this approach to deal with genomic sequence inputs , and show it consistently outperforms already existing approaches , with relative improvements in prediction effectiveness of up to 80.9 % when measured in terms of false discovery rate. However , a major criticism of CNNs concerns their `` black box '' nature , as mechanisms to obtain insight into their reasoning processes are limited. To facilitate interpretability of the SpliceRover models , we introduce an approach to visualize the biologically relevant information learnt. We show that our visualization approach is able to recover features known to be important for splice site prediction ( binding motifs around the splice site , presence of polypyrimidine tracts and branch points) , as well as reveal new features ( e.g. , several types of exclusion patterns near splice sites). SpliceRover is available as a web service. The prediction tool and instructions can be found at http://bioit2.irc.ugent.be/splicerover/. Supplementary materials are available at Bioinformatics online.
