  To inform measurement-based care , practice guidelines suggest routine symptom monitoring , often on a weekly or monthly basis. Increasingly , patient-provider contacts occur remotely ( eg , by telephone and Web-based portals) , and mobile health tools can now monitor depressed mood daily or more frequently. However , the reliability and utility of daily ratings are unclear. This study aimed to examine the association between a daily depressive symptom measure and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( PHQ-9) , the most widely adopted depression<symptom> self-report measure , and compare how well these 2 assessment methods predict patient outcomes. A total of 547 individuals completed smartphone-based measures , including the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 ( PHQ-2) modified for daily administration , the PHQ-9 , and the Sheehan Disability Scale. Multilevel factor analyses evaluated the reliability of latent depression<symptom> based on the PHQ-2 ( for repeated measures) between weeks 2 and 4 and its correlation with the PHQ-9 at week 4. Regression models predicted week 8 depressive symptoms and disability ratings with daily PHQ-2 and PHQ-9. The daily PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 are highly reliable ( range: 0.80-0.88) and highly correlated ( r = .80). Findings were robust across demographic groups ( age , gender , and ethnic minority status). Daily PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 were comparable in predicting week 8 disability and were independent predictors of week 8 depressive symptoms and disability , though the unique contribution of the PHQ-2 was small in magnitude. Daily completion of the PHQ-2 is a reasonable proxy for the PHQ-9 and is comparable to the PHQ-9 in predicting future outcomes. Mobile assessment methods offer researchers and clinicians reliable and valid new methods for depression<symptom> assessment that may be leveraged for measurement-based depression<symptom> care.
