  The vertebrate fossil record of the earliest Carboniferous is notoriously poorly sampled , obscuring a critical interval in vertebrate evolution and diversity. Recent studies of diversity across the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary have proposed a vertebrate mass extinction at the end-Devonian , and recent phylogenies suggest that the origin of the actinopterygian crown may have occurred in the earliest Carboniferous , as part of a broader recovery fauna. However , the data necessary to test this are limited. Here , we describe a partial actinopterygian skull , including diagnostic elements of the posterior braincase , from the Tournaisian Horton Bluff Formation of Blue Beach , Nova Scotia. The braincase surprisingly shows a confluence of characters common in Devonian taxa but absent in Mississippian forms , such as an open spiracular groove; lateral dorsal aortae that pass through open broadly separated , parallel grooves in the ventral otoccipital region , posterior to the articulation of the first infrapharyngobranchial and an intertemporal-supratemporal complex. Phylogenetic analysis places it deep within the actinopterygian stem , among Devonian moythomasiids and mimiids , suggesting more phylogenetically inclusive survivorship of stem group actinopterygians across the end-Devonian mass extinction. With a high lineage survivorship in tetrapods and lungfish across the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary and high vertebrate diversity at Tournaisian localities , this hints at a more gradual turnover between Devonian and Carboniferous vertebrate faunas.
