  Innate lymphoid cells ( ILCs) and natural killer ( NK) cells have garnered considerable interest due to their unique functional properties in immune defense and tissue homeostasis. Our current understanding of how these cells develop has been greatly facilitated by knowledge of T cell biology. Models of T cell differentiation provided the basis for a conceptual classification of these innate effectors and inspired a scheme of their activation and regulation. In this review , we discuss NK cell and ILC development from a `` T cell standpoint '' in an attempt to extend the analogy between adaptive T cells and their innate ILC and NK cell counterparts.
