  To translate and adapt culturally to Brazilian Portuguese the Forgotten Joint Score ( FJS) patient-reported outcome questionnaire. Forty-five patients in the postoperative period ( 3-12 months) of total knee and hip arthroplasty were asked to answer the Br FJS questionnaire , translated into Portuguese based on the guidelines of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research ( ISPOR). Twenty-three patients completed the questionnaire correctly , suggesting changes when pertinent. In the first round of answers , it was observed that 20 % had difficulty in understanding the expression `` joint awareness. '' In further harmonization of the questionnaire , it was decided to change the term `` awareness '' for `` remember. '' After this change no difficulty was observed in understanding for more than 85 % of patients. The FJS questionnaire was translated and culturally adapted to Brazilian Portuguese. Additional studies are underway to compare the reproducibility and validity of the Brazilian translation to other questionnaires already established for the same outcome.
