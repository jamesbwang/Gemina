  Women living with HIV<pathogen> ( WLWH) have elevated risk of human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) related cancers. To assess prevalence , distribution and concordance of cervical , oral , and anal HPV<pathogen> infection , and predictors of oral and anal HPV<pathogen> in WLWH in Denmark. WLWH followed in the Study on HIV<pathogen> , cervical Abnormalities and infections in women in Denmark ( SHADE) were enrolled and examined for cervical , oral , and anal HPV<pathogen> infection. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of anal and oral HPV<pathogen>. A total of 214 of 334 WLWH had sufficient DNA for analysis at all three anatomical sites and were included in analyses. Cervical , oral , and anal high-risk ( hr) HPV<pathogen> prevalence were 28.0 % , 3.7 % and 39.3 %. Most frequent i) cervical , ii) oral and iii) anal hrHPV genotypes were i) hrHPV58 ( 8.4 %) , 52 ( 5.1 %) , 16 ( 5.1 %) and 51 ( 5.1 %); ii) 52 ( 1.4 %) and iii) 51 ( 9.3 %) , 58 ( 8.9 %) , 16 ( 7.0 %) and 18 ( 7.0 %). Among present cervical , oral , and anal hrHPV genotypes , 6.7 % , 12.5 % and 17.9 % were targeted by the 2-or 4-valent HPV<pathogen> vaccines , whereas 50.0 % , 50.0 % and 42.9 % of hrHPV genotypes were covered by the 9-valent HPV<pathogen> vaccine. Anal HPV<pathogen> infection was predicted by cervical HPV<pathogen> infection ( adjusted OR 4.47 ( 95 % CI 2.25-8.89)). Cervical and anal HPV<pathogen> infection were highly prevalent in WLWH. Non-16/ 18 hrHPV genotypes were predominant at all anatomical sites. Almost half of all hrHPV infections at the three anatomical sites could have been prevented by childhood/adolescent vaccination with the 9-valent HPV<pathogen> vaccine.
