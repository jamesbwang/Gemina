  Patients suffering dental trauma are unprepared for the disability challenge and necessary rehabilitation , while a traumatic event places an expanded demand on the dentist who is focused on treating disease. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of traumatic dental injuries ( TDI) on patients , and to compare patients ' and dentists ' perceptions of the event. TDI patients ( aged â‰¥ 21 years) attending a tertiary dental hospital from 2011 - 2013 and their dentists were recruited with informed consent. An exploratory sequential mixed methods design was adopted. The Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP-14) quantitatively identified patients with `` very often '' , `` fairly often '' or `` occasionally '' in at least one of the OHIP-14 questions ( Phase 1) , to participate in the qualitative phase of the study through focus group discussions ( FGD) ( Phase 2). FGD for dentists was conducted separately. Quantitative analysis showed 28-55 % of TDI patients had `` occasional '' to `` very often '' discomfort during eating , increased self-consciousness and embarrassment. Qualitative analysis showed patients were concerned with aesthetic disability , treatment cost and potential tooth loss but overcame their negative outlook and accepted prescribed protective measures. Dentists appreciated patients ' concerns about aesthetics and functional disruptions but were less attuned to patients ' sense of guilt and fear of judgement. TDI exert functional , psychological and social impacts on patients. Patients ' and dentists ' perspectives were useful for understanding the need for continuity of care and the findings could contribute to effective TDI management.
