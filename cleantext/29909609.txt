  Following the wild-spread of Ebola<disease> virus in some part of Africa and outbreak in Nigeria in 2013 , a study was conducted to evaluate bushmeat dealer 's knowledge , attitude about zoonotic wildlife pathogens and the risk of transmission to humans. A cross-sectional survey was done in a community in Nsukka , southeast Nigeria. Hunters ( n = 34) and bushmeat traders ( n = 42) were interviewed. A semi structured questionnaire were used to generate the data. Fisher exact test was used to evaluate significant differences. 12.0 % of the hunters compared to 71 % traders had no knowledge on possible cause of zoonotic infections P < 0.05. 65.0 % of hunters compared to 38 % traders were ignorant regarding the responsibility of public health personnel and veterinarian P < 0.05. 76 % of hunters compared to 43 % of traders were ignorant regarding the existence of zoonosis in Nigeria P < 0.05. There was also statistical association between the group and risk of contacting infection from ectoparasites P < 0.05. Zoonotic disease attitude of respondents did not differ significantly between the groups P > 0.05. The level of the zoonotic awareness was low in the area and therefore , stresses the need for intervention.
