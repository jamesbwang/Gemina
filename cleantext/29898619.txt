  Obinutuzumab ( GA101 , G) was approved in February 2016 by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat follicular lymphoma ( FL) patients who relapsed after , or are refractory to ( R/R) , a rituximab-containing regimen ( R/R-rituximab). In the GADOLIN trial , R/R-rituximab patients who received G plus bendamustine ( B) followed by G-monotherapy ( G + B) for up to 2 years had significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared to patients receiving B-monotherapy. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of G + B vs B-monotherapy for R/R-rituximab FL patients from a US payer perspective. Patient outcomes were simulated using a 3-state area under the curve model including progression-free survival , progressive disease , and death. This study used R/R-rituximab data from the National LymphoCare Study to extrapolate the GADOLIN trial 's refractory FL progression-free and overall survival data to a R/R-rituximab FL population. Drug utilization and adverse events were based on trial data , and costs were based on Medicare reimbursements and drug wholesale acquisition costs in 2016. Utility estimates were derived from published literature. Post-progression treatment costs were based on observed post-progression therapies in GADOLIN. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess model uncertainty. G + B resulted in an increase in quality-adjusted life years relative to B-monotherapy of 1.24 ( 95 % CR = 0.61-1.87); the incremental total cost was $ 58,100 ( 95 % CR = $ 54,500- $ 61,500). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $ 47,000 per QALY gained , and , based on probabilistic simulations , there was a 98 % probability that G + B was cost-effective at the $ 100,000 per QALY threshold. This US-based analysis suggests that treatment with G + B compared to B-monotherapy is likely cost-effective in R/R-rituximab FL patients. Modeling a R/R-rituximab population based on a synthesis of GADOLIN and the National LymphoCare Study data introduces uncertainty in the analysis. However , the findings were robust to sensitivity analyses.
