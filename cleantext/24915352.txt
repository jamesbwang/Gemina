  Kinnow fruit juice was clarified with ultrafiltration hollow fiber membrane module with cross flow. The surface modified polysulfone based membrane having MWCO 10 , 30 and 44 kDa ( three cartridges) were used in these studies. The transmembrane pressure drop , cross flow rate and operating condition effects on the quality of the juice have been analyzed. The quality of clarified kinnow fruit juice were evaluated in terms of pH , viscosity , vitamin C , conductivity , total sugar , titratable acidity , TSS , protein , polyphenol , naringin , pectin , pulp content and organoleptic test. The results showed that the membrane with molecular weight cut off 30 kDa was best membrane among the three membranes<symptom>. The juice could be stored for at least 60 days without any additive.
