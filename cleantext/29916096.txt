  The biotransformation of hexachlorocyclohexane isomers ( HCH) by two Dehalococcoides mccartyi strains ( 195 and BTF08) and an enrichment culture was investigated and compared to conversion by the obligate anaerobic strain Clostridium<pathogen> pasteurianum strain DSMZ 525. The D. mccartyi strains preferentially transformed γ-HCH over α-HCH and δ-HCH isomers while β-HCH biotransformation was not significant. In case of the enrichment culture , γ-HCH was preferentially transformed over the δ-HCH , β-HCH and α-HCH isomers. Major observed metabolites in both cases were tetrachlorocyclohexene and as end products monochlorobenzene ( MCB) and benzene. Dechlorination of the γ-HCH isomer was linked to an increase in cell numbers for strain 195. γ-HCH transformation was linked to considerable carbon stable isotope fractionation with the enrichment factor ε
