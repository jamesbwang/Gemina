  The clinical relevance of diabetes-distress is increasingly recognized , but little is known about the efficacy of interventions specifically targeted to treat elevated diabetes-distress. Therefore , this systematic review sought to determine the efficacy of psychological interventions aimed at treating elevated diabetes-distress in people with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. We systematically searched literature from five databases. Randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) with an English abstract , describing the results of a psychological intervention in adults with diabetes were included. Articles were eligible for inclusion if the primary outcome was diabetes-distress measured by the Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale ( PAID-5/ PAID-20) or the Diabetes Distress Scale ( DDS-17). Only mean group diabetes-distress values above cut-off at baseline or the results of a subgroup above cut-off ( PAID-5 ≥ 8 , PAID-20 ≥ 40 or DDS-17 ≥ 3) were included. The search yielded 8907 articles. After removing 2800 duplicates , 6107 articles remained. Titles and abstracts were screened , leaving 394 potential articles of interest , nine of which were RCTs. In a random-effects meta-analysis , the pooled effect size for diabetes-distress was 0.48 ( Cohen 's d) , Z = 3.91 , P < 0.0001. Statistical heterogeneity was I ² = 46.67 % ( confidence intervals 45.06 % to 48.28 %). Diabetes-tailored psychological interventions reduced HbA This systematic review shows that specifically diabetes-tailored psychological interventions are effective in reducing elevated diabetes-distress and HbA
