  The palatal defect and abnormal dentition in cleft palate make mask ventilation and laryngoscopy difficult. This study aimed to assess the effect of feeding obturator on laryngeal view in unilateral complete cleft palate. Ninety non-syndromic infants scheduled for the first stage correction of complete unilateral cleft palate were randomised to Group A ( no feeding obturator) or Group B ( obturator used for induction and intubation). The primary objective was to assess effect of the feeding obturator on the Cormack-Lehane grade on laryngoscopy. Effects on face mask ventilation , easiness of laryngoscopy and intubation and the side effects were also measured. Ninety patients completed the study. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding the CL grade ( Use of a pre-sized obturator in infants with complete unilateral cleft palate does not improve the laryngoscopic view. However , it results in better face mask ventilation and easier and faster laryngoscopy and intubation.
