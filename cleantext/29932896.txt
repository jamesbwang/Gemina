  The phenomenal migratory and differentiation capacity of neural crest cells has been well established across model organisms. While the earliest stages of neural crest development have been investigated in non-mammalian model systems such as Xenopus and Aves , the early specification of this cell population has not been evaluated in mammalian embryos , of which the murine model is the most prevalent. Towards a more comprehensive understanding of mammalian neural crest formation and human comparative studies , we have used the rabbit as a mammalian system for the study of early neural crest specification and development. We examine the expression profile of well-characterized neural crest markers in rabbit embryos across developmental time from early gastrula to later neurula stages , and provide a comparison to markers of migratory neural crest in the chick. Importantly , we apply explant specification assays to address the pivotal question of mammalian neural crest ontogeny , and provide the first evidence that a specified population of neural crest cells exists in the rabbit gastrula prior to the overt expression of neural crest markers. Finally , we demonstrate that FGF signaling is necessary for early rabbit neural crest formation , as SU5402 treatment strongly represses neural crest marker expression in explant assays. This study pioneers the rabbit as a model for neural crest development , and provides the first demonstration of mammalian neural crest specification and the requirement of FGF signaling in this process.
