 : The management of soft-tissue defects following surgery for chronic osteomyelitis<disease> of the tibia is challenging. It often requires complex reconstructive procedures , especially when the distal third of the tibia is involved. We present a relatively simple method of addressing these defects.: This study aims to report our experience with the use of the sural Island musculo fasciocutaneous flap in the management of osteomyelitis<disease> of the tibia.: Consecutive patients with osteomyelitis<disease> of the tibia requiring soft-tissue cover were managed using the sural Island<disease> musculo fasciocutaneous flap , and the outcome was analyzed. The study was prospective in nature.: There were 21 patients , 15 males and 6 females. Their ages ranged from 21 years to 62 years. Most ( 71 %) were in the 3 The sural Island musculo fasciocutaneous flap is a reliable source of richly vascularized soft tissue for the management of dead space and soft-tissue defects in chronic osteomyelitis<disease> of the tibia. It has the added advantage of providing sizeable tissue , with good reach to all segments of the tibia.
