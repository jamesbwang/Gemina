  Root-knot nematode ( Meloidogyne spp. , RKN) causes a disease that significantly reduces the yield of greenhouse cucumber crops year after year. Chemical control based on a single pesticide is now unreliable mainly due to pest resistance. Fumigant and non-fumigant pesticide combinations can potentially result in effective and economic RKN control. Combining the insecticide abamectin ( ABM) with fumigants dazomet ( DZ) or chloropicrin ( CP) significantly extended the half-life of ABM by an average of about 1.68 and 1.56 times respectively in laboratory trials , and by an average of about 2.02 and 1.69 times respectively in greenhouse trials. Laboratory experiments indicated that all the low rate ABM combination treatments controlled RKN through a synergistic effect. ABM diffused into the nematode epidermis more rapidly when ABM was combined with DZ and CP , giving effective nematode control and an increase cucumber total yield , compared to the use of these products alone. ABM combined with CP or DZ produced significantly higher total cucumber yield than when these products were used alone. A low concentration of ABM combined with DZ in preference to CP would be an economic and practical way to control nematode and soilborne fungi<pathogen> in a greenhouse producing cucumbers.
