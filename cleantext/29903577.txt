  Central nervous system ( CNS) related injuries and exsanguination have been the most common causes of death in trauma for decades. Despite improvements in haemorrhage control in recent years exsanguination is still a major cause of death. We conducted a prospective database study to investigate the current incidence of haemorrhage related mortality. A prospective database study of all trauma patients admitted to an urban major trauma centre between January 2007 and December 2016 was conducted. All in-hospital trauma deaths were included. Cause of death was reviewed by a panel of trauma surgeons. Patients who were dead on arrival were excluded. Trends in demographics and outcome were analysed per year. Further , 2 time periods ( 2007-2012 and 2013-2016) were selected representing periods before and after implementation of haemostatic resuscitation and damage control procedures in our hospital to analyse cause of death into detail. 11,553 trauma patients were admitted , 596 patients ( 5.2 %) died. Mean age of deceased patients was 61 years and 61 % were male. Mechanism of injury ( MOI) was blunt in 98 % of cases. Mean ISS was 28 with head injury the most predominant injury ( mean AIS head 3.4). There was no statistically significant difference in sex and MOI over time. Even though deceased patients were older in 2016 compared to 2007 ( 67 vs. 46 years , p < 0.001) , mortality was lower in later years ( p = 0.02). CNS related injury was the main cause of death in the whole decade; 58 % of patients died of CNS in 2007-2012 compared to 76 % of patients in 2013-2016 ( p = 0.001). In 2007-2012 9 % died of exsanguination compared to 3 % in 2013-2016 ( p = 0.001). In this cohort in a major trauma centre death by exsanguination has decreased to 3 % of trauma deaths. The proportion of traumatic brain injury has increased over time and has become the most common cause of death in blunt trauma. Besides on-going prevention of brain injury future studies should focus on treatment strategies preventing secondary damage of the brain once the injury has occurred.
