  The possibility of directed stimulation of intramolecular electron transfer between a metal and a redox-active ligand in a molecular coordination compound is the key to its application in molecular catalysis and other research themes. Although the stimulation by a substitution reaction of the co-ligands is often postulated as key step in catalytic cycles using redox-active ligands as electron reservoirs , there are only a few explicit examples for such reactions. Herein we report the synthesis of the first dicationic and dinuclear CuI complexes featuring the oxidized form of a redox-active tetrakisguanidine ligand ( 1,2,4,5-tetrakis ( tetramethylguanidino) benzene 1) as a bridging ligand and two neutral co-ligands L ( acetonitrile or pyridine) , ( 1 ( Cu ( Cl) L) 2) 2 +. An intramolecular electron transfer between the copper atom and the tetrakisguanidine ligand 1 , leading to a dinuclear CuII complex with the reduced form of the tetrakisguanidine ligand 1 , is triggered by substitution of the neutral co-ligands L.
