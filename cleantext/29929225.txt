  Long-term nitrogen ( N) fertilization affects soil aggregation and localizations of soil organic carbon ( SOC) , N and microbial parameters within aggregates. The mechanisms of these N effects are poorly understood. We studied these processes in a loamy soil from a 23-year repeated N addition field experiment under a rice-barley rotation. Nitrogen fertilization increased plant productivity and the portion of large macroaggregates ( > 2 mm). However , SOC contents in macro- and micro-aggregates remained constant despite an N-induced increase of 27 % in root C input into soil. Therefore , N fertilization accelerated SOC turnover. Nitrogen addition increased total N ( TN) content in bulk soil and two macroaggregates ( > 2 , and 1-2mm) , but not in microaggregates ( < 0.25 mm). Also , N fertilization increased the phospholipid fatty acids ( PLFAs) contents of fungi<pathogen> in the large macroaggregates , but not in the microaggregates. In contrast , the effect of N addition on contents of bacterial and total microbial PLFAs was not apparent. Nitrogen fertilization increased N-acetyl-Î²-D-glucosaminidase ( NAG) activities in the two larger macroaggregate size classes ( > 2 , and 1-2mm) , but not in the aggregates ( < 1 mm). In both control and N fertilization , the large macroaggregates localized more TN , microbial PLFAs , and NAG activities than the microaggregates. In conclusion , long-term N fertilization not only directly promotes soil N resource but also indirectly improves soil structure by forming large macroaggregates , accelerates SOC turnover , and shiftes localization of microorganisms to the macroaggregates.
