  Chironomids , a major invertebrate taxon in many standing freshwaters , rely on adult flight to reach new suitable sites , yet the impact of weather conditions on their flight activity is little understood. We investigated diel and seasonal flight activity patterns of aquatic and terrestrial chironomids in a reclaimed sandpit area and analysed how weather conditions and seasonality influenced their total abundance and species composition. Air temperature , relative humidity , wind speed , and air pressure significantly affected total flight activity of both groups , but not in the same way. We identified an intermediate temperature and humidity optimum for the flight activity of terrestrial chironomids , which contrasted with weaker , timescale-dependent relationships in aquatic species. Flight activity of both groups further declined with wind speed and increased with air pressure. Observed flight patterns also varied in time on both daily and seasonal scale. Flight activity of both groups peaked in the evenings after accounting for weather conditions but , surprisingly , aquatic and terrestrial chironomids used partly alternating time windows for dispersal during the season. This may be driven by different seasonal trends of key environmental variables in larval habitats and hence implies that species phenologies and conditions experienced by chironomid larvae ( and probably other aquatic insects with short-lived adults) influence adult flight patterns more than weather conditions. Our results provide detailed insights into the drivers of chironomid flight activity and highlight the methodological challenges arising from the inherent collinearity of weather characteristics and their diurnal and seasonal cycles.
