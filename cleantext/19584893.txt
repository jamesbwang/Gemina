  Spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA) results from insufficient levels of the survival motor neuron ( SMN) protein. Drosophila is conducive to large-scale genetic-modifier screens which can reveal novel pathways underpinning the disease mechanism. We tested the ability of a large collection of genomic deletions to enhance SMN-dependent lethality. To test our design , we asked whether our study can identify loci containing genes identified in previous genetic screens. Our objective was to find a common link between genes flagged in independent screens , which would allow us to expose novel functions for SMN in vivo. Out of 128 chromosome deficiency lines , 12 ( 9.4 %) were found to consistently depress adult viability when crossed to SMN loss-of-function heterozygotes. In their majority , the enhancing deletions harboured genes that were previously identified as genetic modifiers , hence , validating the design of the screen. Importantly , gene overlap allowed us to flag genes with a role in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs that are crucial for determining the axes of the oocyte and future embryo. We find that SMN is also required for the correct localisation of gurken and oskar mRNAs in oocytes. These findings extend the role of SMN in oogenesis by identifying a key requirement for mRNA trafficking.
