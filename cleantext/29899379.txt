  The balance<symptom> between stem cell maintenance and differentiation has been proposed to depend on antagonizing ubiquitination and deubiquitination reactions of key stem cell transcription factors ( SCTFs) mediated by pairs of E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes. Accordingly , increased ubiquitination results in proteasomal degradation of the SCTF , thereby inducing cellular differentiation , whereas increased deubiquitination stabilizes the SCTF , leading to maintenance of the stem cell fate. In neural stem cells , one of the key SCTFs is c-Myc. Previously , it has been shown that c-Myc is ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase TRIM32 , thereby targeting c-Myc for proteasomal degradation and inducing neuronal differentiation. Accordingly , TRIM32 becomes upregulated during adult neurogenesis. This upregulation is accompanied by subcellular translocation of TRIM32 from the cytoplasm of neuroblasts to the nucleus of neurons. However , we observed that a subpopulation of proliferative type C cells already contains nuclear TRIM32. As these cells do not undergo neuronal differentiation , despite containing TRIM32 in the nucleus , where it can ubiquitinate c-Myc , we hypothesize that antagonizing factors , specifically deubiquitinating enzymes , are present in these particular cells. Here we show that TRIM32 associates with the deubiquitination enzyme USP7 , which previously has been implicated in neural stem cell maintenance. USP7 and TRIM32 were found to exhibit a dynamic and partially overlapping expression pattern during neuronal differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly , we are able to demonstrate that USP7 deubiquitinates and thereby stabilizes c-Myc and that this function is required to maintain neural stem cell fate. Accordingly , we propose the balanced ubiquitination and deubiquitination of c-Myc by TRIM32 and USP7 as a novel mechanism for stem cell fate determination.
