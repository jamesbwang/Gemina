  To explore the molecular mechanism of a case of ABO discrepancies based on the results of blood group serology. Five cases of the two-generation pedigrees were analyzed. ABO genotypes were determined using serological tests. DNA sequence analysis was performed on exon 6 , exon 7 and intron 3 of the 5 cases to confirm the genotypes of a proband with B subgroup and 4 family members. There were 3 cases of subgroup AB3 and 1 case of subgroup B3 among the 5 family members. The genotypes were identified as A102/B303 and O02/B303 , respectively. B303 differed from B101 by intron 3 point mutation ( intron3 + 5G > A). The point mutation of intron 3 ( intron 3 +5 G > A) is specific in B303.
