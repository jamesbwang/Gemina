  Adenoma detection rate ( ADR) and serrated polyp detection rate ( SDR) vary significantly among colonoscopists. Colonoscopy inspection quality ( CIQ) is the quality with which a colonoscopist inspects for polyps and may explain some of this variation. We aimed to determine the relationship between CIQ and historical ADRs and SDRs in a cohort of colonoscopists and assess whether there is variation in CIQ components ( fold examination , cleaning , and luminal distension) among colonoscopists with similar ADRs and SDRs. We conducted a prospective observational study to assess CIQ among 17 high-volume colonoscopists at an academic medical center. Over 6 weeks , we video-recorded > 28 colonoscopies per colonoscopist and randomly selected 7 colonoscopies per colonoscopist for evaluation. Six raters graded CIQ using an established scale , with a maximum whole colon score of 75. We evaluated 119 colonoscopies. The median whole-colon CIQ score was 50.1/ 75. Whole-colon CIQ score ( r = 0.71; P < .01) and component scores ( fold examination r = 0.74; cleaning r = 0.67; distension r = 0.77; all P < .01) correlated with ADR. Proximal colon CIQ score ( r = 0.67; P < .01) and component scores ( fold examination r = 0.71; cleaning r = 0.62; distension r = 0.65; all P < .05) correlated with SDR. CIQ component scores differed significantly between colonoscopists with similar ADRs and SDRs for most of the CIQ skills. In a prospective observational study , we found CIQ and CIQ components to correlate with ADR and SDR. Colonoscopists with similar ADRs and SDRs differ in their performance of the 3 CIQ components-specific , actionable feedback might improve colonoscopy technique.
