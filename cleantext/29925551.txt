  To explore cross-sectional and longitudinal gray matter ( GM) volume changes in patients with migraine and their association with patients ' clinical characteristics and disease activity. Brain T2-weighted and 3-dimensional T1-weighted scans were acquired from 73 episodic migraineurs and 46 age- and sex-matched nonmigraine controls at baseline. Twenty-four migraineurs and 25 controls agreed to be reexamined after a mean follow-up of 4 years. Using a general linear model and SPM12 , a whole-brain analysis was performed to assess GM volume modifications. At baseline , compared to controls , patients with migraine showed lower cerebellar GM volume and higher volume of regions of the frontotemporal lobes. At follow-up , migraineurs were significantly older than controls. Over the follow-up , migraineurs developed an increased volume of frontotemporoparietal regions , which was more prominent in patients with a higher baseline disease activity: long disease duration and high attack frequency. Migraineurs also developed decreased GM volume of visual areas , which was related to higher pain severity. Patients with an increased attack frequency at follow-up experienced both increased and decreased volume of nociceptive regions. In migraineurs , reduced GM volume of extrastriate visual areas during the follow-up was significantly correlated to baseline disease activity: shorter disease duration and lower attack frequency. In this cohort , the migraine brain changes dynamically over time , and different pathophysiologic mechanisms can occur in response to patients ' disease severity. The interaction between predisposing brain traits and experience-dependent responses might vary across different nociceptive and visual areas , thus leading to distinct patterns of longitudinal GM volume changes.
