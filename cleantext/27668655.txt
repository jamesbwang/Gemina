  The recent emergence of cancer immunotherapies initiated a significant shift in the clinical management of metastatic melanoma. Prior to 2011 , melanoma patients only had palliative treatment solutions which offered little to no survival benefit. In 2018 , with immunotherapy , melanoma patients can now contemplate durable or even complete remission. Treatment with novel immune checkpoint inhibitors , anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 , clearly result in superior median and long-term survivals compared to standard chemotherapy; however , more than half of the patients do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade. Currently , clinicians do not have any effective way to stratify melanoma patients for immunotherapies. Research is now focusing on identifying biomarkers which could predict a patient 's response prior treatment initiation ( or very early during treatment course) , in order to maximize therapeutic efficacy , avoid unnecessary costs , and undesirable heavy side effects for the patient. Given the rapid developments in this field and the translational potential for some of the biomarkers , we will summarize the current state of biomarker research for immunotherapy in melanoma , with an emphasis on omics technologies such as next-generation sequencing and mass cytometry ( CyTOF).
