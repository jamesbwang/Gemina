  Smooth emergence or cough<symptom> prevention is a clinically important concern in patients undergoing laryngomicroscopic surgery ( LMS). The purpose of this study was to estimate the effective concentration of remifentanil in 95 % of patients ( EC95) for the prevention of emergence cough<symptom> after LMS under propofol anesthesia using the biased coin design ( BCD) up-down method.A total of 40 adult patients scheduled to undergo elective LMS were enrolled. Anesthesia induction and maintenance were performed with target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. Effective effect-site concentration ( Ce) of remifentanil in 95 % of patients for preventing emergence cough<symptom> was estimated using a BCD method ( starting from 1 ng/mL with a step size of 0.4 ng/mL). Hemodynamic and recovery profiles were observed after anesthesia.According to the study protocol , 20 patients were allocated to receive remifentanil Ce of 3.0 ng/mL , and 20 patients were assigned to receive lower concentrations of remifentanil , from 1.0 to 2.6 ng/mL. Based on isotonic regression with a bootstrapping method , EC95 ( 95 % CI) of remifentanil Ce for the prevention of emergence cough<symptom> from LMS was found to be 2.92 ng/mL ( 2.72-2.97 ng/mL). Compared with patients receiving lower concentrations of remifentanil , the incidence of hypoventilation before extubation and extubation time were significantly higher in those receiving remifentanil Ce of 3.0 ng/mL. However , hypoventilation incidence after extubation and staying time in the recovery room were comparable between the 2 groups.Using a BCD method , the EC95 of remifentanil Ce for the prevention of emergence cough<symptom> was estimated to be 2.92 ng/mL ( 95 % CI: 2.72-2.97 ng/mL) after LMS under propofol anesthesia.
