  To evaluate potential of a semiquantitative method using standardized uptake value ( SUV) in First , we performed a phantom study to validate the accuracy of measuring SUV. 52 patients ( 25 male , 27 female; mean age of 75.1-year-old; 40 and 12 patients with neurodegenerative diseases with or without presynaptic dopaminergic deficits , respectively) were enrolled in a retrospective study. We measured SBR , maximum SUV , peak SUV , mean SUV , and striatum-to-background ratio of SUV ( SUV The phantom study revealed errors of < 10 % between theoretical and actual SUVs. Although there were significant correlations between SBR and all SUV-based parameters , SUV SBR is a promising parameter to aid differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases with or without presynaptic dopaminergic deficit. Although technically acceptable , SUV may not be superior to SBR when clinically applied in
