  Skeletal muscle atrophy is a common feature of numerous chronic pathologies and is correlated with patient mortality. The REDD1 protein is currently recognized as a negative regulator of muscle mass through inhibition of the Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway. REDD1 expression is notably induced following glucocorticoid secretion , which is a component of energy stress responses. Unexpectedly , we show here that REDD1 instead limits muscle<symptom> loss<symptom> during energetic stresses such as hypoxia and fasting by reducing glycogen depletion and AMPK activation. Indeed , we demonstrate that REDD1 is required to decrease O Therefore , REDD1 is a crucial negative regulator of energy expenditure that is necessary for muscle adaptation during energetic stresses. This present study could shed new light on the role of REDD1 in several pathologies associated with energetic metabolism alteration , such as cancer , diabetes , and Parkinson 's disease.
