  This study analyses the difference in 25OH-vitamin D values between two groups of patients both affected by severe osteoporosis with fragility fractures , but one group has vertebral fractures and the other one has hip fractures. Patients with hip fractures have vitamin D values lower than patients with vertebral fractures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 25OHD levels in patients with fragility vertebral fractures ( VF) and hip fractures ( HF) and make a comparison between the groups. In the first group were enrolled ambulatory patients with 3 or more moderate to severe VF; in the second group were enrolled patients hospitalized in the Department of Orthogeriatrics undergoing surgery for HF. For all patients , we collected values of 25OHD and PTH. The group of patients with VF was further subdivided into pre-existing VF or recent VF treated within 30 days with vertebroplasty. The sample consists of 180 subjects divided into two groups: 90 with VF and 90 with HF. The average value of 25OHD in the total sample was 13.2 ± 9.6 ng/ml , Vitamin D was significantly lower in the HF group than the VF group ( p < 0.001) ( VF 18.6 ± 9.7 ng/ml , HF 7.9 ± 5.7 ng/ml). The mean PTH value in the total sample was 67.5 ± 54.9 pg/ml and PTH was significantly higher in the HF group compared to the group with VF ( p < 0.001) ( VF 55.6 ± 27.2 pg/ml , HF 78.7 ± 70.2 pg/ml). The mean 25OHD value in the recent VF group is 16.0 ± 6.6 ng/ml while in the pre-existing VF group is 19.5 ± 10.4 ng/ml with a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.001). Patients of the same age with severe osteoporosis have a lower 25OHD value when the fracture occur at the hip and is recent , probably this is due to the inflammation<symptom> caused by fracture and/or surgical intervention.
