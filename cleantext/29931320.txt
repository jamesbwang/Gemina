  Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH) agonists replaced estrogens for endocrine treatment of advanced prostate cancer ( PC) because of cardiovascular side effects. The fetal estrogen estetrol ( E4) may be safer for PC treatment and is expected to decrease testosterone ( T) and prevent estrogen deficiency. To investigate the safety and T suppressive effect of E4 in healthy males. Double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , dose-escalating study. The study was conducted at a phase I clinical unit ( QPS , The Netherlands). Healthy male volunteers aged 40-70 years. Three treatment cohorts of 15 volunteers with placebo ( n = 5) and E4 ( n = 10). Estetrol doses tested were 20 mg , 40 mg and 60 mg per day. Subjects were treated for 4 weeks. Subjective side effects , pharmacodynamic effects on hemostatic variables , lipids , glucose , bone parameters and endocrine parameters related to T metabolism. Total and free T decreased dose-dependently and significantly. Nipple tenderness<symptom> occurred in 40 % and decrease of libido in 30 % of E4 treated men. The unwanted estrogenic effects on hemostasis were small , dose-dependent and in some cases significant. Lipid and bone parameters showed a favorable trend. The effect of E4 on testosterone levels is insufficient for stand-alone PC treatment. Taking all clinical and pharmacodynamic variables into consideration , a daily dose of 40 mg E4 seems safe for further evaluation of endocrine PC treatment in combination with LHRH analogues.
