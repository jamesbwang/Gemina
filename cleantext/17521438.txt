  Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated ( Cas) proteins provide acquired genetic immunity against the entry of mobile genetic elements ( MGEs). The immune defense provided by various subtypes of the CRISPR-Cas system has been confirmed and is closely associated with the formation of immunological memory in CRISPR arrays , called CRISPR adaptation or spacer acquisition. However , whether type II-C CRISPR-Cas systems are also involved in spacer acquisition remains largely unknown. This study explores and provides some definitive evidence regarding spacer acquisition of the type II-C CRISPR-Cas system from
