  The aim of this study is to compare the incidence of postoperative pain using the ProTaper Next ( PTN) , WaveOne Gold ( WOG) , and Self-Adjusting File ( SAF) systems. Two hundred and fourteen patients with irreversible pulpitis were selected for single-visit endodontics. The teeth were blindly assigned to three groups based on the instrumentation system used: Group A ( PTN) , Group B ( WOG) , and Group C ( SAF). Participants were asked to note the incidence of the pre- and postoperative pain on a visual analog scale at different time intervals. Paired The greatest mean pain in Group A ( PTN) and Group B ( WOG) was found to be maximum in the first 24 h with a significant reduction in pain at the subsequent observation time points of 48 h , 72 h , and 7 days. Group C ( SAF) showed minimum pain followed by Group B followed by Group A which showed comparatively higher pain scores even at the end of 7 days. In single-visit endodontics , SAF system may prove to be a better system compared with PTN and WOG as it produces minimal postoperative pain , thus improving the overall acceptance of endodontic treatment.
