  To investigate the effect of an SGLT-2 inhibitor on diabetic nephropathy and serum oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( ox-LDL) levels. We randomly divided 126 patients with diabetic nephropathy into the treatment group and control group. The 63 patients in the treatment group received an SGLT-2 inhibitor in addition to routine insulin therapy , while the control group received only insulin to control blood glucose. All laboratory indexes were recorded before and after treatment with the SGLT-2 inhibitor. The prognosis of patients was followed-up. Simultaneously , 63 healthy and BMI-matched in-patients were selected as the healthy control group. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all groups , and the levels of ROS were measured by ELISA. Renal function indexes such as urinary protein , creatinine , blood urea nitrogen , and glomerular filtration rate ( GFR) were significantly higher with SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment compared with the control group ( p < 0.05). The fasting blood glucose level was not significantly increased before or after treatment ( p > 0.05). The levels of ROS in peripheral blood were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group ( p < 0.05). Observation at the 1-year follow-up showed that the average GFR was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the control group. Furthermore , the proportion of patients with stage 1-3 chronic kidney disease was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the control group ( p < 0.05). The SGLT-2 inhibitor had a good therapeutic effect on renal function in patients with diabetic nephropathy , without having effects on fasting blood glucose. Additionally , it significantly delayed the progression of nephropathy. It is therefore worth clinical promotion.
