  To investigate the learning factor during a perceptual-auditory analysis of an unusual task in three different groups. 269 listeners , divided into three groups: 73 voice specialists Speech Language Pathologists ( EG) , 84 voice specialists Speech Language Pathologists ( NEG); and 112 non-speech pathologists in the Naive Group ( NG). They all completed a listening session that included 18 synthesized and 18 human voices with different types and degrees of deviation ( 50 % of repetition for intra-rater consistency analysis). The task was to classify the voices as human or synthesized. We analyzed the learning factor by comparing the initial error percentage , first 18 voices , with the final , last 18 voices. EG presented less error towards the end of the task ( 25.5 %) than at the beginning ( 28.6 %) with statistical difference ( p = 0.024). The error percentage of the beginning and the end of the task did not differ for the NEG and the NG ( NEG beginning = 36.5 % , end = 35.3 %; NG beginning = 38.3 % , end = 37.7 %). The EG was the only group to present evidence of learning factor. Therefore , it seems that professional experience positively influences the perceptual-auditory analysis , which reinforces the impact of its training to become a voice specialist. Moreover , the voice specialists seem to be more prepared and more susceptible to use learning strategies to improve their performance during a perceptual-auditory analysis task , even if unusual.
