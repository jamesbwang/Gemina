  Graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT). In this study , monocyte subtypes were characterized regarding cytokine expression pattern and development in the context of GvHD. Using inflammatory S100 proteins for monocyte stimulation , it could be demonstrated that intermediate monocytes are the main producers of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFα known to be involved in the development of Th17 cells pointing towards an inflammatory phenotype of this monocyte subtype. Furthermore , novel aspects regarding monocyte subtype development were found. Our data reveal that prednisolone promotes the induction of intermediate monocytes from classical monocytes which correlates with HSP70 expression levels. However , 1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment results in the abrogation of the prednisolone-mediated induction of this inflammatory monocyte subset and low HSP70 expression levels. Treatment of classical monocytes with pifithrin-μ , a specific HSP70 inhibitor , also leads to an inhibited induction of intermediate monocytes in the presence of prednisolone. These data point towards a predominant role of HSP70 in the development of intermediate monocytes. Thus , HSP70 might be a promising target for GvHD therapy , especially in combination with glucocorticoids , in order to decrease intermediate monocyte subset levels.
