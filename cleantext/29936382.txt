  Antitumor efficacy of ursolic acid ( UA) is seriously limited due to its low hydrophilicity and needy bioavailability. To overcome these obstacles , chemosensitive polyspermine ( CPSP) conjugated with UA and folic acid ( FA) as a novel targeted prodrug was designed and successfully synthesized in this investigation. This prodrug not only showed high aqueous solubility , GSH-triggered degradation and good biocompatibility , but also exhibited better inhibition effect on the tumor cells proliferation in comparison with free UA. FA-CPSP-UA could down-regulate the generation of GSH and manifest excellent ability in enhancing antitumor efficacy. In addition , FA-CPSP-UA could inhibit the expression of MMP-9 , which led to restricting MCF-7 cells migration. Taken together , the results indicated that FA-CPSP-UA , as a carrier , can efficiently deliver UA to folate receptor positive cancer cells and improve tumor therapy of UA by Chemosensitive effect.
