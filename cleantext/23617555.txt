  Falls are a common concern for wheeled mobility device users with multiple sclerosis ( MS); however , no evidence-based fall prevention programs have been developed to meet the specific needs of the population. We examine the preliminary feasibility of a fall management intervention in wheeled mobility device users with MS. Study participants were exposed to an intervention program targeting risk factors for falls , including transfer skills and seated postural control. The feasibility of the program was evaluated by assessing participant perspectives , cost , recruitment rates , study adherence , participant retention , safety , and the ability to collect primary and secondary outcomes , including fall frequency , concerns about falling , transfer quality , and seated postural control. 16 wheeled mobility device users completed the program , which was found to be feasible and was positively evaluated by participants. No adverse events were experienced. After exposure to the intervention , fall frequency significantly decreased ( P < .001) and transfer quality ( P = .001) and seated postural control ( P = .002) significantly improved. No significant differences were found regarding concerns about falling ( P = .728). This study examined the feasibility of an intervention program to manage fall risk in wheeled mobility device users with MS. The program was found to be feasible , and preliminary results showed the intervention to be effective in decreasing fall frequency. Additional testing is needed to further examine the efficacy and long-term impact of the intervention.
