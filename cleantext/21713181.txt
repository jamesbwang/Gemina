  Perceiving an external stimulus depends not only on the physical features of the stimulus , but also fundamentally on the current state of neuronal excitability , indexed by the power of ongoing alpha-band and beta-band oscillations ( 8-30 Hz). Recent studies suggest that heightened excitability does not improve perceptual precision , but biases observers to report the presence of a stimulus regardless of its physical presence. It is unknown whether this bias is due to changes in observers ' subjective perceptual experience ( perceptual bias) or their perception-independent decision-making strategy ( decision bias). We tested these alternative interpretations in an EEG experiment in which male and female human participants performed two-interval forced choice ( 2IFC) detection and discrimination. According to signal detection theory , perceptual bias only affects 2IFC detection , but not discrimination , while interval decision bias should be task independent. We found that correct detection was more likely when excitability before the stimulus-present interval exceeded that before the stimulus-absent interval ( i.e. , 8-17 Hz power was weaker before the stimulus-present interval) , consistent with an effect of excitability on perceptual bias. By contrast , discrimination accuracy was unaffected by excitability fluctuations between intervals , ruling out an effect on interval decision bias. We conclude that the current state of neuronal excitability biases the perceptual experience itself , rather than the decision process.
