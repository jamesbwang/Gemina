  Many care workers at elderly care facilities in Japan suffer occupational low back pain ( LBP) despite the utilization of welfare equipment. When introducing welfare equipment such as hoists and sliding boards , education on appropriate care methods using welfare equipment is usually conducted , but the effect of education diminishes with time. This intervention study aimed to examine the effect of re-education on appropriate care methods using welfare equipment on the prevention of care workers ' LBP at an elderly care facility. At the intervention facility , 49 care workers were enrolled in ergonomic education program for 1.5 years in order to improve care methods using welfare equipment. At the non-intervention facility , 33 care workers were not enrolled in the program. Rates of severe LBP were not significantly different between the facilities. However , during the study period , the rate of severe LBP among care workers did not increase at the intervention facility , while it doubled among care workers at the non-intervention facility. The care workers at the intervention facility showed improvement in care methods using welfare equipment during the study period. Hence , we think that re-education regarding appropriate care methods using welfare equipment has the potential to prevent exacerbation of LBP.
