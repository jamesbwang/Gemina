  Pseudoaneurysms adjacent to exostoses have been commonly reported in the femoral and popliteal arteries and only rarely in the upper extremity. We describe a case of an 18-year-old man with multiple hereditary exostoses who developed a brachial artery pseudoaneurysm after minor trauma to his right upper arm , adjacent to a known lesion<symptom>. He was referred to a vascular surgeon who removed the pseudoaneurysm and repaired the artery with a saphenous vein graft. We encourage a high suspicion of vascular injury even after minor trauma when an osteochondroma is adjacent to a vascular structure.
