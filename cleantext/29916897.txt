  Long noncoding RNA ( lncRNA) metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 ( MALAT1) functions as a crucial regulator of metastasis in lung cancer. The aim of this study is to unravel the underlying mechanisms of lncRNA MALAT1 in non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). A cohort of 36 NSCLC tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues was collected postoperatively from patients with NSCLC. qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of MALAT1 in both NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Cell migration and invasion were monitored by wound<disease> healing assay and transwell invasion assay. Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition proteins and Akt/mTOR key components after treatment. Dual luciferase reporter assay coupled with qRT-PCR was used to verify the direct interaction between MALAT1 and miR-206. MALAT1 was significantly up-regulated in both NSCLC tissues and cell lines. High expression of MALAT1 correlated positively with tumor size and lymphatic metastasis in NSCLC , whereas no correlation was found between MALAT1 expression and sex , age , clinical stage , and histological grade. We also showed that MALAT1 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition , cell migration , and invasion by activating Akt/mTOR signaling in A549 and H1299 cells. miR-206 was a direct downstream target of MALAT1 in NSCLC. MALAT1 promoted cell migration and invasion by sponging miR-206 in NSCLC cells. In addition , miR-206 inhibited MALAT1-mediated activation of Akt/mTOR signaling in A549 and H1299 cells. lncRNA MALAT1 promotes migration and invasion of NSCLC by targeting miR-206 and activating Akt/mTOR signaling.
