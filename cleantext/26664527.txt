  It is possible to prevent deaths due to cervical cancer through screening and treatment. Cervical cytology which is a standard screening tool in developed countries fails as a screening method in low-resource countries due to financial and technical constraints. To determine the prevalence of pre-malignant lesions<symptom> of the cervix by VIA and Pap smear test among rural married women and to find out association of socio demographic factors with positive screening test results. A community based cross-sectional study was carried out among rural married women in the field practice area of a tertiary health care center. A pre-designed questionnaire was administered to collect information on socio-demographic characteristics from 550 women. They were tested for the presence of pre-malignant lesions<symptom> of the cervix using VIA and Pap smear as screening tools. Out of 550 study participants , total 37 patients were found positive , out of which 7 , 17 & 13 patients were found positive by Pap smear alone , VIA test alone , and by both these tests respectively. Moderate agreement ( k = 0.498) was found between these two tests by applying Kappa statistics at 95 % confidence interval. The VIA and Pap smear tests were positive among 5.5 % and 3.6 % study subjects respectively. The positivity rate was found to be more in the age group of > 50 years , Hindu , SC/ST caste , joint family , professional and , upper class. The prevalence of pre-malignant lesions<symptom> of the cervix by VIA test was 5.5 % while 3.6 % pre-malignant lesion<symptom> was detected by Pap smear method. VIA and Pap smear positivity rates among rural married women.
