  The goal of this retrospective investigation was to provide evidence of the longevity of machine-surfaced implants placed in native bone and treated with the original two-stage surgical protocol. The observation times of this study covered periods of 13 to 32 years. Consecutive cases were impossible; the patients ' ages when treated reduced the number of available people as a result of death , relocation , being impossible to find , or refusal to cooperate. Mean marginal bone loss after 13 to 32 years was 1.9 Â± 0.9 mm , survival rate was 97.7 % , and success rate was 92.7 %. Peri-implantitis occurred in a limited number of cases , with a prevalence of 1.8 %. This study demonstrates long-term reliability of machined implants as a therapeutic choice.
