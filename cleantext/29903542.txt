  To report the results of radial nerve grafting in 7 children who sustained a radial nerve injury following a distal humeral fracture. Seven children , mean age 6 years ( range , 4-11 years) , underwent nerve grafting for radial nerve injuries following distal humeral fractures. The mean interval between injury and surgery was 6.7 months ( range , 6-9 months). In all cases , 3 sural nerve graft cables were used , of mean length 8.6 cm ( range , 6-12 cm). Mean follow-up was 19.9 months ( range , 12-24 months). Wrist , finger , and thumb extension range of motion and strength were evaluated at final follow-up , using the British Medical Research Council ( BMRC) rating scale. The radial nerve was entrapped within the fracture site in 2 patients , and in 5 , it was completely interrupted without entrapment. All patients obtained full active wrist extension with grade M4 BMRC strength. For finger extension , all patients were graded as M4 , obtaining full metacarpophalangeal finger and thumb extension , with the wrist in neutral in 3 patients and fully extended in 4. During the thumbs-up test , 4 patients achieved complete extension of all thumb joints , and 3 exhibited metacarpophalangeal extension lag , averaging 30 Â°. Nerve grafting of radial nerve injuries at the level of the distal humerus in children can yield excellent outcomes. Therapeutic V.
