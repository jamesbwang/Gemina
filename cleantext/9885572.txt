  Endometrial cancer is one of the most common cancers of the female reproductive system. CHD4 , a core subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation ( NuRD) complex<pathogen> , is frequently mutated in these patients. However the role it plays in promoting endometrial tumorigenesis is poorly understood. Here , we use genetic engineering approaches to modulate CHD4 expression levels and functionally evaluate hot spot mutations R975H and R1162W. We find that CHD4 depletion induces up-regulation of the cancer stem cell ( CSC) marker CD133. This CSC phenotype was verified functionally by invasion ability , spheroid formation , and tumorigenicity
