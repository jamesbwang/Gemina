  The aim of the study was to determine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH) content in different forest<disease> humus types. The investigation was carried out in Chrzan√≥w Forest District in southern Poland. Twenty research plots with different humus types ( mor and mull) were selected. The samples for analysis were taken after litter horizons removing from a depth of 0-10 cm ( from the Of- and Oh-horizon total or A-horizon). pH , organic carbon and total nitrogen content , base cations , acidity , and heavy metal content were determined. In the natural moisture state , the activity of dehydrogenase was determined. The study included the determination of PAH content. The conducted research confirms strong contamination of study soil by PAHs and heavy metals. Our experiment provided evidence that different forest<disease> humus types accumulate different PAH amounts. The highest content of PAHs and heavy metals was recorded in mor humus type. The content of PAHs in forest<disease> humus horizon depends on the content and quality of soil organic matter. Weaker degradation of hydrocarbons is associated with lower biological activity of soils. The mull humus type showed lower content of PAHs and at the same time the highest biological activity confirmed by high dehydrogenase activity.
