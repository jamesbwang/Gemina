  Cardiac tamponade is a vital emergency. It occurs when the accumulation of intra-pericardial fluid exceeds the pericardial adaptation capacity. Pericardial pressure is equalized with that of cardiac cavities and severe heart<symptom> failure<symptom> occurs , most often rapidly. Several clinical presentations are possible. The diagnosis is based on the assessment of pericardial<symptom> effusion<symptom> and its impact on the heart by echocardiography. Supportive treatments have limited effectiveness. The only emergency treatment is drainage of the pericardium by direct puncture or by surgical approach.
