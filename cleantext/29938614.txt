  Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between Kinesin like protein 6 ( KIF6) gene Trp719Arg and major cardiovascular events ( MACEs) risk in subjects who received statin therapy. Methods PubMed , EmBase , and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception through September 2017. The selected studies evaluated the association of Trp719Arg with MACEs in individuals who received statins. Relative risk ( RR) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI) were used to evaluate the effect of statin therapy on MACEs in subjects carrying polymorphisms , and the odds ratio ( OR) and 95 % CI were used to evaluate the relationship between Trp719Arg and MACE risk in individuals who received statins , using the random-effects model. Results Seven studies were included ( N = 48,885). Overall , we found that statin therapy significantly reduced the risk for MACEs in subjects carrying ArgArg ( RR: 0.79; 95 % CI: 0.69-0.90; P = 0.001) , ArgTrp ( RR: 0.71; 95 % CI: 0.60 -0.83; P < 0.001) , ArgArg + ArgTrp ( RR: 0.71; 95 % CI: 0.63 -0.81; P < 0.001) , and TrpTrp ( RR: 0.79; 95 % CI: 0.73-0.85; P < 0.001). Furthermore , there was no significant difference between subjects carrying ArgArg and those carrying TrpTrp ( OR: 1.11; 95 % CI: 0.92-1.34; P = 0.265). However , ArgTrp ( OR: 1.29; 95 % CI: 1.07-1.55; P = 0.007) and ArgArg + ArgTrp ( OR: 1.26; 95 % CI: 1.05-1.51; P = 0.012) were associated with an increased risk for MACEs when compared with TrpTrp. Conclusions Statin therapy significantly reduced the risk for MACEs in subjects carrier specific KIF6 gene Trp719Arg polymorphisms. Further , subjects carrying ArgTrp or ArgArg + ArgTrp had a greater incidence of MACEs as compared with TrpTrp when they received statins.
