  Wound management , in addition to presenting a significant burden to patients and their families , also contributes significantly to a country & rsquo; s healthcare costs. Treatment strategies are numerous , but in most cases not ideal. Hydrogels , three-dimensional polymeric materials that can withstand a great degree of swelling without losing structural integrity , are drawing great attention for their use as topical wound<disease> management solutions in the form of films and as vehicles for drug delivery , due to their unique properties of high water content , biocompatibility , and flexibility. Hydrogels , both naturally and synthetically derived , can be tuned to respond to specific stimuli such as pH , temperature and light and they are ideally suited as drug delivery vehicles. Here we provide a brief overview of the history and characteristics of hydrogels , assess their uses in wound<disease> management and drug delivery , and compare them with other types of common drug delivery vehicle.
