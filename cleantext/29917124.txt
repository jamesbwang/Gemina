  Socioeconomic disparities have been established for conventional cigarette use , but not for electronic cigarettes. This study estimates socioeconomic gradients in exclusive use of conventional cigarettes , electronic cigarettes , and dual use ( i.e. , use of both products) among adults in the United States. Analyses consider nationally representative data on 25 to 54 year old respondents to the 2014-2016 National Health Interview Surveys ( N = 50,306). Demographically-adjusted seemingly unrelated regression models estimate how two socioeconomic status measures- respondent education and household income- relate to current exclusive use of conventional cigarettes , electronic cigarettes , and dual use. Conventional cigarette use exhibits negative education and income gradients , consistent with existing research: -12.8 percentage points ( CI: -13.9 , -11.7) if college educated , and -9.4 percentage points ( CI: -10.8 , -7.9) if household income exceeds 400 % of the federal poverty level. These gradients are flatter for dual use ( -1.3 ( CI: -1.8 , -0.8) and -1.8 ( CI: -2.4 , -1.2)) , and statistically insignificant for electronic cigarette use ( -0.03 ( CI: -0.5 , 0.4) and -0.3 ( CI: -0.8 , -0.2)). Limiting the sample to ever-smokers , higher education is associated with a 0.9 percentage point increase in likelihood of exclusive electronic cigarette use ( CI: 0.0 , 1.9). Education and income gradients in exclusive electronic cigarette use are small and statistically insignificant , contrasting with strong negative gradients in exclusive conventional cigarette use. Furthermore , more educated smokers are more likely to switch to exclusive e-cigarette use than less educated smokers. Such differential switching may exacerbate socioeconomic disparities in smoking-related morbidity and mortality , but lower the burden of tobacco-related disease.
