  In nearly all cases of general anaesthesia with a volatile agent , the anaesthetic concentration has to be increased. Since the anaesthetic affects both the factors determining intracranial homeostasis and the systemic circulation , it is crucial that cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP) is protected. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of gradually increased concentrations of desflurane on the cerebral and systemic circulations based on CPP , mean arterial pressure ( MAP) , intracranial pressure ( ICP) and their correlations. The study was carried out on 25 rabbits of the same gender ( male) randomly assigned to two groups: control ( n = 10) and group I ( n = 15). Over three 15-minute periods , the animals were exposed to increase concentrations of desflurane so as to achieve 1/3 , 2/3 and 1 MAC Minimal Alveolar Concentration ( 3 , 6 , 9 vol %) of the effective end-tidal concentration of desflurane ( Et) at the end of each period , respectively. Intragroup analysis of CPP changes demonstrated decreases in its successive values from minute 18 , compared with baseline values. The mean values of ICP did not differ throughout the experiment. From minute 19 on , all successive values of MAP decreased compared with baseline values. A weak correlation ( r = -0.2179) was found between ICP and CPP and a strong correlation between MAP and CPP ( r = 0.98829). Moreover , there was a strong correlation between Etdesflurane vs. CPP ( r = -0.8769) and MAP ( r = -0.8224) and a weak correlation versus ICP ( r = 0.15755). A decrease in CPP induced by desflurane was associated with a decrease in MAP but not an increase in ICP. The depressive effect of desflurane on the cerebral and systemic circulations is a consequence of its effector site concentration.
