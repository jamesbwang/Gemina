  The males of different species of Bactrocera and Zeugodacus fruit flies are commonly attracted to plant-derived phenylpropanoids ( e.g. methyl eugenol ( ME)) or phenylbutanoids ( e.g. raspberry ketone ( RK)) but almost never to both. However , one particular plant-derived phenylbutanoid , zingerone ( ZN) , which possesses an intermediate chemical structure between ME and RK , weakly attracts both ME- and RK-responding fruit fly species. Bactrocera jarvisi , an Australian fruit fly species , is weakly attracted to cue lure ( an analogue of RK) but strongly attracted to ZN. Here , we investigated the minimum olfactory threshold and optimum sensitivity of B. jarvisi males to ZN and RK as a function of dose , time and sexual maturation. Our results show that B. jarvisi males had a marked preferential response to ZN , with a much lower olfactory threshold and faster response time to ZN than RK. Probit analysis demonstrated that ZN was at least > 1600 Ã— more potent than RK as a male attractant to B. jarvisi. Although fruit fly male attraction to the phytochemicals is generally associated with sexual maturity , in B. jarvisi immature males were also attracted to ZN. Our results suggest that B. jarvisi males have a fine-tuned olfactory response to ZN , which appears to play a central role in the chemical ecology of this species.
