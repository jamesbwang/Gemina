  Orofacial pain and temporomandibular dysfunction may cause chronic facial<symptom> pain<symptom> , which may interfere with the emotional state and food intake of patients with eating disorders ( ED) , such as anorexia<symptom> nervosa ( AN) and bulimia nervosa ( BN). Sixty-four patients were assigned to four groups: Group A ( AN- restricting subtype): 07; Group B ( AN- purging subtype): 19; Group C ( BN): 16; and Group D ( control): 22. Complaints of pain are more prevalent in individuals with eating disorders ( p < 0.004). There are differences between the presence of myofascial pain and the number of hospitalizations ( p = 0.046) and the presence of sore<symptom> throat<symptom> ( p = 0.05). There was a higher prevalence of masticatory myofascial pain and complaints of pain in other parts of the body in ED patients; however , there was no difference between ED subgroups. There was no difference in the number of self-induced vomiting<symptom> between ED patients with and without myofascial pain.
