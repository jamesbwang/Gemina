  The effectiveness of bariatric surgery among Medicaid beneficiaries , a population with a disproportionately high burden of obesity , remains unclear. We sought to determine if weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and regain following bariatric surgery differed in Medicaid patients compared to commercial insurance. Data from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery , a ten-site observational cohort of adults undergoing bariatric surgery ( 2006-2009) were examined for patients who underwent Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass ( RYGB) , Laparoscopic Adjustable Band ( LAGB) , or Sleeve Gastrectomy ( SG). Using piecewise spline linear mixed-effect models , weight change over 5 years was modeled as a function of insurance type ( Medicaid , N = 190; commercially insured , N = 1448) , time , procedure type , and sociodemographic characteristics; additionally , interactions between all time , insurance , and procedure type indicators allowed time- and procedure-specific associations with insurance type. For each time-spline , mean ( kg) difference in weight change in commercially insured versus Medicaid patients was calculated. Medicaid patients had higher mean weight at baseline ( 138.3 kg vs. 131.2 kg). From 0 to 1 year post-operatively , Medicaid patients lost similar amounts of weight<symptom> to commercial patients following all procedure types ( mean weight Δ difference ( 95 % CI): RYGB: -0.9 ( -3.2 , 1.4); LAGB: -1.5 ( -6.7 , 3.8); SG: 5.1 ( -4.0 , 14.2)). From 1 to 3 years post-operatively Medicaid and commercial patients continued to experience minimal weight<symptom> loss<symptom> or began to slowly regain weight ( mean weight Δ difference ( 95 % CI): RYGB: 0.9 ( 0.0 , 2.0); LAGB: -2.1 ( -4.2 , 0.1); SG: 0.7 ( -3.0 , 4.3)). From 3 to 5 years post-operatively , the rate of regain tended to be faster among commercial patients compared to Medicaid patients ( mean weight Δ difference ( 95 % CI): RYGB: 1.1 ( 0.1 , 2.0); LAGB: 1.5 ( -0.5 , 3.5); SG: 1.0 ( -2.5 , 4.5)). Although Medicaid patients had a higher baseline weight , they achieved similar amounts of weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and tended to regain weight at a slower rate than commercial patients.
