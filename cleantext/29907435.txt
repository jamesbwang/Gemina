  The objective of the study was to compare the deep subfascial approach to subfascial approach in terms of facial nerve injury and quality of life. A randomized study was performed from August 2013 to March 2017 on 24 patients with unilateral TMJ ankylosis. The subjects were randomly allotted to either Group I ( 12 , Deep Subfascial) or Group II ( 12 , Subfascial). All patients were evaluated objectively for facial nerve injury post-operatively and subjectively for quality of life in the form of a questionnaire post-operatively for 6 months. The data were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics , mean standard deviation , Wilcoxon paired t test , Friedman 's test , and Mann Whitney U test. The comparison of the difference between the groups for postoperative facial nerve function at various time intervals did not give any significant differences ( p > 0.05). In terms of quality of life there was a significant difference at 1 month post-operatively ( p < 0.05) amidst the two approaches , however , 6-month follow-up revealed that there is no significant difference between the two approaches ( p > 0.05). The study reveals that both the approaches are safe in terms of facial nerve injury and quality of life long term.
