  We show that the application of a spin-polarized current to a double p domain wall system with a variable distance between the walls results in an interaction between the two domain walls. The transmission spectrum changes from that of a spin-dependent resonant double barrier to one like a ( Formula: see text) wall. In addition , the spin torque on each individual wall creates coupled motion in the domain walls. The walls move independently with a fast speed at large separations , but slow considerably at small separations.
