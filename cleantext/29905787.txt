  Status epilepticus ( SE) is an abnormally prolonged seizure<symptom> that results from either a failure of mechanisms that terminate seizures<symptom> or from initiating mechanisms that inherently lead to prolonged seizures<symptom>. Here we report that mice experiencing a 3 hours of SE caused by pilocarpine exhibit a rapid increase in expression of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase gene ( Dio2) and a decrease in the expression of type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase gene in hippocampus , amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase in hippocampal sections was seen concentrated in the neuronal nuclei , typical of ischemic injury of the brain. An unbiased analysis of the hippocampal transcriptome of mice undergoing 3 hours of SE revealed a number of genes , including those involved with response to oxidative stress , cellular homeostasis , cell signaling , and mitochondrial structure. In contrast , in mice with targeted disruption of Dio2 in astrocytes ( Astro D2KO mouse) , the highly induced genes in the hippocampus were related to inflammation<symptom> , apoptosis , and cell death. We propose that Dio2 induction caused by SE accelerates production of T3 in different areas of the central nervous system and modifies the hippocampal gene expression profile , affecting the balance<symptom> between adaptive and maladaptive mechanisms.
