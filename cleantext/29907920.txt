  Previous research suggests that individuals with developmental dyslexia perform below typical readers on non-linguistic cognitive tasks involving the learning and encoding of statistical-sequential patterns. However , the neural mechanisms underlying such a deficit have not been well examined. The aim of the present study was to investigate the event-related potential ( ERP) correlates of sequence processing in a sample of children diagnosed with dyslexia using a non-linguistic visual statistical learning paradigm. Whereas the response time data suggested that both typical and atypical readers learned the statistical patterns embedded in the task , the ERP data suggested otherwise. Specifically , ERPs of the typically developing children ( n = 12) showed a P300-like response indicative of learning , whereas the children diagnosed with a reading disorder ( n = 8) showed no such ERP effects. These results may be due to intact implicit motor learning in the children with dyslexia but delayed attention-dependent predictive processing. These findings are consistent with other evidence suggesting that differences in statistical learning ability might underlie some of the reading deficits observed in developmental dyslexia.
