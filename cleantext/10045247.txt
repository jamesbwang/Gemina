  We report on electronic structure measurements of the interface between hematite nanoparticles ( 6 nm diameter) and aqueous solutions. Using soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy from a liquid microjet we detect valence and core-level photoelectrons as well as Auger electrons from liquid water , from the nanoparticle-water interface , and from the interior of the aqueous-phase nanoparticles. Most noteworthy , the method is shown to be sufficiently sensitive for the detection of adsorbed hydroxyl species , resulting from H
