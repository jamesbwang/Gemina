  The mechanism of oxygen activation at a dicobalt bis-Î¼-hydroxo core is probed by the implementation of synthetic methods to isolate reaction intermediates. Reduction of a dicobalt ( iii , iii) core ligated by the polypyridyl ligand dipyridylethane naphthyridine ( DPEN) by two electrons and subsequent protonation result in the release of one water moiety to furnish a dicobalt ( ii , ii) center with an open binding site. This reduced core may be independently isolated by chemical reduction. Variable-temperature 1H NMR and SQUID magnetometry reveal the reduced dicobalt ( ii , ii) intermediate to consist of two low spin Co ( ii) centers coupled antiferromagnetically. Binding of O2 to the open coordination site of the dicobalt ( ii , ii) core results in the production of an oxygen adduct , which is proposed to be a dicobalt ( iii , iii) peroxo. Electrochemical studies show that the addition of two electrons results in cleavage of the O-O bond.
