  To investigate whether the protective effects of L-carnitine ( LC) against hydrogen peroxide ( H_2O_2)- induced injury in hepatocytes were related to nuclear factor-kappa B ( NF-κB). CCK-8 and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) methods were used to detect the influences of NF-κB inhibitors on the cell damage induced by H_2O_2. The effects of LC on the NF-κB expressions in H_2O_2-treated HL7702 cells were determined by Western blot. The translocation of NF-κB was observed by immunofluorescence staining. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA) was used to evaluate NF-κB-DNA binding activities. Compared with H_2O_2 group , NF-κB inhibitor groups showed increased cell activities and decreased LDH release ( P < 0. 05 , P < 0. 01). Western blot and immunofluorescence staining both demonstrated that the nucleus NF-κB expressions elevated in H_2O_2 group and LC had inhibitory effect on them ( P < 0. 01). LC also inhibited H_2O_2-induced increase of NF-κB-DNA binding activity inHL7702 cells. LC protects against H_2O_2-induced injury in HL7702 cells by inhibiting NF-κB activities.
