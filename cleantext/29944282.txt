  Pancreatic cancer is the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. It is a very lethal and aggressive tumor , with a 5-year overall survival rate under 5 % for confirmed ductal adenocarcinoma. Even though many genes have been identified as possible treatment targets , surgery remains the only curative treatment. Imaging is essential to the initial workup and is mostly based on CT-scan and MRI studies. Resectability is based on the absence of distant metastases and arterial vasculature infiltration. 3D imaging reconstruction could add precision to the surgical evaluation. Many phase II non randomized studies have shown that neo-adjuvant chemotherapy had a positive effect on pancreatic cancer. Nevertheless this approach is only reserved for cases with locally advanced tumors.
