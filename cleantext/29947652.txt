  The objective was to examine the mediation hypothesis of body dissatisfaction and analyze their association with weight-teasing and body satisfaction. A total of 253 girls who attended 10 schools from SÃ£o Paulo , Brazil , participated in this study. Data collection was carried out through a validated and self-reported questionnaire. Study variables were weight-teasing ( independent) , body satisfaction ( mediation) , and weight control behavior ( outcome). Effect mediation analyses showed a significance level of 5 % ( p < 0.05). Prevalence of family and peers weight-teasing were 38.5 % and 40.6 % , respectively. Body dissatisfaction was associated with unhealthy weight control behaviors when controlled by family and peer weight-teasing. Data indicate that family and peers teasing are important aspects that interfere in body satisfaction and weight control behaviors.
