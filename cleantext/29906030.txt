To examine the effect of Buddhist mindfulness meditation combined with standard treatment on depression<symptom> and quality of life in major depressive patient compared to the control group. It was a quasi experimental study. The subjects with age ranged 20-70 years old and had Thai Hamilton rating scale for depression<symptom> 13-29 scores were divided in two groups , each group contained 30 persons. The intervention was Buddhist mindfulness meditation which meditated everyday at least 5 days/week , 15 minutes each time , for six weeks. Both groups were treated with standard treatment.

The difference between the average of Thai Hamilton rating scale for depression<symptom> ( 17.33 +5.22 in meditation group and 17.67 +6.33 in control group) and WHOQOL-BREF-THAI questionnaire ( 29.97 +15.95 in meditation group and 31.33 +12.12 in control group) before and after meditation was not statistically significantly among the two groups ( p > 0.05). However , it found that at the 6th week , 28 patients from the meditation group ( 93.3 %) and 22 patients ( 73.3 %) from the nonmeditating group improved from depression<symptom> When examining by the Chi-square , the meditating group had a statistically significantly different in the number of patients that improved from depression<symptom> ( p-value = 0.04).
