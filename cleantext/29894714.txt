  Peripheral nerve injury is one of the most common clinical diseases. Although the regeneration of the peripheral nerve is better than that of the nerves of the central nervous system , because of its growth rate restrictions after damage. Hence , the outcome of repair after injury is not favorable. Small RNA , a type of non-coding RNA , has recently been gaining attention in neural injury. It is widely distributed in the nervous system in vivo and a significant change in the expression of small RNAs has been observed in a neural injury model. This suggests that MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) may serve as a potential target for resolving the challenges of peripheral nerve repair. This review summarizes the current challenges in peripheral nerve injury repair , systematically expounds the mechanism of miRNAs in the process of nerve injury and repair and attempts to determine the possible treatment of peripheral nerve injury.
