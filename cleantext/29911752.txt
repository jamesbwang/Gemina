  One-stage direct-to-implant post-mastectomy breast reconstruction has been gaining popularity over the traditional two-stage/tissue-expander approach. To evaluate the outcome of the two post-mastectomy breast reconstruction procedures in terms of patient satisfaction. Clinical data were collected by file review for patients who underwent mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction at two tertiary medical centers in 2010-2013. Patients were asked to complete the BREAST-Q instrument , sent to them by post with a self-addressed , stamped , return envelope. Scores were compared by type of reconstruction performed. Of the 92 patients who received the questionnaire , 59 responded: 39 had one-stage breast reconstruction and 20 underwent two-stage reconstruction. The two-stage reconstruction group was significantly older , had more background diseases , and were followed for a longer period. The one-stage reconstruction group had a higher proportion of BRCA mutation carriers. There was no significant between-group difference in postoperative complications. Mean BREAST-Q scores were similar in the two groups for all dimensions except satisfaction with information , which was higher in the patients after one-stage reconstruction. Women with more background diseases had better sexual well-being , and married women had better psychological well-being. Breast satisfaction was lower among patients treated with radiation and higher among patients with bilateral reconstruction; the latter subgroup also had higher physical well-being. Complications did not affect satisfaction. Patients were equally satisfied with the outcome of one- and two-stage breast reconstruction. The choice of technique should be made on a case-by-case basis. Cost analyses are needed to construct a decision-making algorithm.
