  Despite mounting evidence on the association between work stress and burnout , there is limited knowledge about the extent to which workers ' age and gender are associated with burnout. To evaluate the relationship between age , gender and their interaction with burnout in a sample of Canadian workers. Data were collected in 2009-12 from a sample of 2073 Canadian workers from 63 workplaces in the province of Quebec. Data were analysed with multilevel regression models to test for linear and non-linear relationships between age and burnout. Analyses adjusted for marital status , parental status , educational level and number of working hours were conducted on the total sample and stratified by gender. Data were collected from a sample of 2073 Canadian workers ( response rate 73 %). Age followed a non-linear relationship with emotional exhaustion<symptom> and total burnout , while it was linearly related to cynicism and reduced professional efficacy. Burnout level reduced with increasing age in men , but the association was bimodal in women , with women aged between 20-35 and over 55 years showing the highest burnout level. These results suggest that burnout symptoms varied greatly according to different life stages of working men and women. Younger men , and women aged between 20-35 and 55 years and over are particularly susceptible and should be targeted for programmes to reduce risk of burnout.
