  To study the effect of different data standardization methods on the spectrum-effect relationship for anticoagulant effect of Trichosanthis Fructus dropping pills. The spectrum-effect relationship was studied by using grey correlation degree method between three doses of Trichosanthis Fructus dropping pills and prothrombintime ( PT) in mice. The effect of 10 data standardization methods , namely minimization method , maximum method , data extreme difference method , standard deviation standardization method , initialization transformation method , mean transformation method , ratio of each chromatographic peak area to the total peak area , ratio of each chromatographic peak area to the common peak area , logarithmic standardization method and tangent normalization method on the spectrum-effect relationship between Trichosanthis Fructus dropping pills and PT in mice was evaluated by using relative correlation degree as the index. The results of spectrum-effect relationship can be expressed by the minimization method , the data extreme difference method , the standard deviation standardization method , the initialization method and the mean transformation method , with highest relative correlation degree by the mean transformation method. As compared with the mean transformation method , there were significant differences between the high dose group and the medium dose group in the minimization method and the data extreme difference method (
