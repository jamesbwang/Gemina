  The acute phase response ( APR) is the first line of defense of the vertebrate immune system against pathogens. Mounting an immune response is believed to be energetically costly but direct measures of metabolic rate during immune challenges contradict this assumption. The energetic cost of APR for birds is higher than for rodents , suggesting that this response is less expensive for mammals. However , the particularly large increase in metabolic rate after APR activation for a piscivorous bat (
