  Mandatory fortification of staple grains with folic acid and/or vitamin B12 ( B12) is under debate in many countries including Ireland , which has a liberal , but voluntary , fortification policy. Older adults can be at risk of both deficiency and high folate status , although little is known on the actual prevalence and the major predictors. Population prevalence estimates from older adults ( n 5290 ≥ 50 years) from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing ( TILDA) ( Wave 1) are presented here. Measures included plasma total vitamin B12 and folate , whereas predictors included detailed demographic , socio-economic , geographic , seasonal and health/lifestyle data. The prevalence of deficient or low B12 status ( 45 nmol/l) was observed in 8 · 9 % , whereas high B12 status was observed in 3 · 1 % ( > 601 pmol/l). The largest positive predictor of B12 concentration was self-reported B12 injection and/or supplement use ( coefficient 51 · 5 pmol/; 95 % CI 9 · 4 , 93 · 6; P = 0 · 016) followed by sex and geographic location. The largest negative predictor was metformin use ( -33 · 6; 95 % CI -51 · 9 , -15 · 4; P < 0 · 0001). The largest positive predictor of folate concentration was folic acid supplement use ( 6 · 0; 95 % CI 3 · 0 , 9 · 0 nmol/l; P < 0 · 001) followed by being female and statin medications. The largest negative predictor was geographic location ( -5 · 7; 95 % CI -6 · 7 , -4 · 6; P < 0 · 0001) followed by seasonality and smoking. B-vitamin status in older adults is affected by health and lifestyle , medication , sampling period and geographic location. We observed a high prevalence of low B12 and folate status , indicating that the current policy of voluntary fortification is ineffective for older adults.
