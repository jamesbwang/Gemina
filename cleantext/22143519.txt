  Gram-negative bacteria represent the most relevant reservoir of resistance to antibiotics in the environment. The natural selection of resistant clones of bacteria in the environment by antimicrobial selective pressure is a relevant mechanism for spreading antibiotic resistance traits in both the community and hospital environment. This is in scenarios where antimicrobials are used irrationally , and even in the propagation of livestock , poultry birds , and for other veterinary purposes. This study sought to detect the prevalence of FOX-1 AmpC β-lactamase genes from abattoir samples. The isolation of Forty-eight Abattoirs could represent a major reservoir of resistance genes especially AmpC β-lactamase , and this could serve as a route for the dissemination of multidrug-resistant bacteria in the community. Thus , the molecular identification of drug-resistant genes is vital for a reliable epidemiological investigation and the forestalling of the emergence and spread of these organisms through the food chain in this region.
