  Antipsychotic drugs are frequently prescribed to older adults , but they may be associated with serious adverse effects. The objective was to investigate the association between use of antipsychotics in older adults and the risk of urinary<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> ( UTIs<disease>). This study was designed as a cohort study.Data were obtained from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink from January 1 , 2000 , to September 29 , 2016. Primary care patients 65 years or older in the United Kingdom with a first prescription for an oral antipsychotic were included in the study.Incidence of UTIs<disease> was calculated for periods with and without exposure to antipsychotic drugs in one cohort. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis with Andersen-Gill extension for recurrent events was used to calculate hazard ratios ( HRs) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI). During the study period , 191,827 individuals with a first prescription for an oral antipsychotic drug were identified. Current use of antipsychotics was associated with an increased risk of UTI compared with past use ( adjusted HR , 1.31; 95 % CI , 1.28-1.34). This effect was strongest in the first 14 days of use ( adjusted HR , 1.83; 95 % CI , 1.73-1.95) and in individuals who used more than one antipsychotic drug concomitantly ( adjusted HR , 1.64; 95 % CI , 1.45-1.87). The risk was slightly higher for typical antipsychotics than for atypical antipsychotics. Stratification by sex showed that risk estimates were slightly higher in men than in women.Use of antipsychotics was associated with an increased risk of UTIs<disease> in both men and women , particularly in the first weeks after the start of treatment.
