  The Bayesian literature has shown that the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ( HMC) algorithm is powerful and efficient for statistical model estimation , especially for complicated models. Stan , a software program built upon HMC , has been introduced as a means of psychometric modeling estimation. However , there are no systemic guidelines for implementing Stan with the log-linear cognitive diagnosis model ( LCDM) , which is the saturated version of many cognitive diagnostic model ( CDM) variants. This article bridges the gap between Stan application and Bayesian LCDM estimation: Both the modeling procedures and Stan code are demonstrated in detail , such that this strategy can be extended to other CDMs straightforwardly.
