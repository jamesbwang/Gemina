  The kori bustard ( Ardeotis kori) is one of the largest extant flighted birds and is displayed in zoos primarily in North<pathogen> America and Europe. In captivity , kori bustard diets are primarily based on animal proteins , whereas in the wild these birds eat a wide variety of plants , insects , and small vertebrate prey. The purpose of this study was to compare circulating iron , total iron binding capacity , and percent transferrin saturation levels in apparently healthy wild and captive kori bustards. Adult captive kori bustards had slightly higher percent transferrin saturation levels than juvenile captive birds , although this finding was not statistically significant. This information can be referenced as a guide for the assessment of nutrition and health in captive birds.
