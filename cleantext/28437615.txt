  The progress in the field of neural computation hinges on the use of hardware more efficient than the conventional microprocessors. Recent works have shown that mixed-signal integrated memristive circuits , especially their passive ( 0T1R) variety , may increase the neuromorphic network performance dramatically , leaving far behind their digital counterparts. The major obstacle , however , is immature memristor technology so that only limited functionality has been reported. Here we demonstrate operation of one-hidden layer perceptron classifier entirely in the mixed-signal integrated hardware , comprised of two passive 20 × 20 metal-oxide memristive crossbar arrays , board-integrated with discrete conventional components. The demonstrated network , whose hardware complexity is almost 10 × higher as compared to previously reported functional classifier circuits based on passive memristive crossbars , achieves classification fidelity within 3 % of that obtained in simulations , when using ex-situ training. The successful demonstration was facilitated by improvements in fabrication technology of memristors , specifically by lowering variations in their I-V characteristics.
