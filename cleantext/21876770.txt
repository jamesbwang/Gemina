  Soils support terrestrial ecosystem function and therefore are critical urban infrastructure for generating ecosystem services. Urbanization processes modify ecosystem function by changing the layers of soils identified as soil horizons. Soil horizons are integrative proxies for suites of soil properties and as such can be used as an observable unit to track modifications within soil profiles. Here , in an analysis of 11 cities representing 10 of the 12 soil orders , we show that urban soils have âˆ¼ 50 % fewer soil horizons than preurban soils. Specifically , B horizons were much less common in urban soils and were replaced by a deepening of A horizons and a shallowing of C horizons. This shift is likely due to two processes: (
