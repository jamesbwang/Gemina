  The detection of human rhinoviruses ( HRV) is highly prevalent in children with pneumonia<disease> , bronchiolitis<disease> , acute asthma and croup; however , there is also evidence that HRV is common in asymptomatic individuals. The majority of studies on the role of different HRV serotypes during acute<disease> respiratory<disease> tract<disease> infections<disease> episodes have limited sample size to fully characterize the epidemiology of HRV infection , including those from low-middle income countries , where the burden of childhood respiratory<disease> disease<disease> is greatest. We systematically reviewed HRV clinical and molecular epidemiology in low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Southeast Asia before November 2015. We identified 31 studies , which included data from 13 African and 6 Southeast Asian countries , emphasizing the gaps in knowledge surrounding HRV infections. HRV was one of the most prevalent respiratory viruses detected during childhood respiratory<disease> disease<disease> ( 13 % -59 %); however , many studies could not determine the attributable role of HRV in the pathogenesis of acute<disease> respiratory<disease> infections<disease> due to high prevalence of detection among asymptomatic individuals ( 6 % -50 %). A meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the prevalence of HRV identification between children of different age groups; or between children with severe disease compared with asymptomatic children. These data highlight the need for large-scale surveillance projects to determine the attributable etiologic role of HRV in
