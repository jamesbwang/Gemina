  The aim of the present study is to examine the heterogeneity of attenuated psychotic symptoms ( PS) and related personality factors using a cluster analytic approach. A large sample of participants from the general population was evaluated in terms of attenuated symptomatology ( psychotic and affective) and two personality factors: encoding style and impulsivity traits. Cluster analysis emphasized the existence of five independent clusters: High Psychosis , High Positive , High Negative , High Impulsive-Low Psychosis , and Low Psychosis. Cluster comparisons demonstrated that the personality factors and PS are differentially involved in the clusters. The present study demonstrated that reliable and relatively distinct clusters of individuals from the general population can be identified based on established PS and related personality factors. The fact that a variety of profiles was observed contributes to a better understanding of the nature of the heterogeneity characterizing PS and has clear theoretical and clinical implications.
