  Transcutaneous osseointegrated prostheses provide stable connections to the skeleton while eliminating skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> experienced with socket prosthetics. Additive manufacturing can create custom textured implants capable of interfacing with amputees ' residual bones. Our objective was to compare osseointegration of textured surface implants made by electron beam melting ( EBM) , an additive manufacturing process , to machine threaded implants. Whole body vibration was investigated to accelerate osseointegration. Two cohorts of Sprague-Dawley rats received bilateral , titanium implants ( EBM vs. threaded) in their tibiae. One cohort comprising five groups vibrated at 45 Hz: 0.0 ( control) , 0.15 , 0.3 , 0.6 or 1.2 g was followed for six weeks. Osseointegration was evaluated through torsional testing and bone volume fraction ( BV/TV). A second cohort , divided into two groups ( control and 0.6 g) , was followed for 24 days and evaluated for resonant frequency , bone-implant contact ( BIC) and fluorochrome labeling. The EBM textured implants exhibited significantly improved mechanical stability independent of vibration , highlighting the benefits of using EBM to produce custom textured surfaces. Bone formation on and around the EBM textured implants increased compared to machined implants , as seen by BIC and fluorescence. No difference in torque , BIC or fluorescence among vibration levels was detected. BV/TV significantly increased at 0.6 g compared to control for both implant types.
