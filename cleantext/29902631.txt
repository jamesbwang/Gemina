  Hereditary antithrombin deficiency is associated with a high incidence of venous thromboembolism ( VTE) , but VTE risk differs between families. Beta-antithrombin is reported to be the most active isoform of antithrombin in vivo. Whether β-antithrombin activity and subtypes in antithrombin deficiency have impact on VTE risk has not been investigated outside the proband setting. We performed a retrospective family cohort study to investigate whether subtypes of antithrombin deficiency or β-antithrombin levels are associated with the risk of first or recurrent VTE. Eighty-one subjects from 21 families were included , of which 52 were antithrombin deficient. Βeta-antithrombin levels were decreased in most type I and type IIPE subjects , but normal levels were found in all subtypes of antithrombin deficiency. The annual incidence of VTE in antithrombin-deficient family members was 1.24 % , 95 % CI: 0.72-1.99 % , in low β-antithrombin 1.36 % ( 95 % CI: 0.76-2.25 %) and in normal β-antithrombin 0.79 % ( 95 % CI: 0.10-2.77). The annual incidence of recurrence in family members was 3.1 % ( 95 % CI: 0.9-7.1 %). Duration of anticoagulation had an impact on recurrence risk: In family members annual recurrence with fixed duration was 10 % ( 95 % CI: 2.1-29.2 %) , with indefinite duration 1.5 % ( 95 % CI: 0.2-5.4 %) , p < 0.05. Beta-antithrombin levels were not associated with the risk for first or recurrent VTE in antithrombin deficient subjects. In this high-risk antithrombin-deficient population , both subjects with low and normal plasma β-antithrombin activity had high risks of first and recurrent VTE. This puts the importance of β-antithrombin into question. Long-term anticoagulation is warranted in antithrombin-deficient VTE patients.
