  Nutrient transporters have attracted significant attention for their promising application in biomimetic delivery. Due to the active consumption of nutrients , cancer cells generally overexpress nutrient transporters to meet their increased need for energy and materials. For example , albumin-binding proteins ( ABPs) are highly overexpressed in malignant cells , stromal cells , and tumor vessel endothelial cells responsible for albumin uptake. ABP ( e.g. , SPARC) is a promising target for tumor-specific drug delivery , and albumin has been widely used as a biomimetic delivery carrier. Apart from the transportation function , ABPs are closely associated with neoplasia , invasion , and metastasis. Herein , a summary of the roles of ABP in cancer progression and the application of albumin-based biomimetic tumor-targeted delivery through the ABP pathway is presented.
