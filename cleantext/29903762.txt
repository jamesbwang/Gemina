  Graft-versus-host disease assessment has been shown to be a challenge for healthcare professionals , leading to the development of the eGVHD App ( www.uzleuven.be/egvhd). In this study , we formally evaluated the accuracy of using the App compared to traditional assessment methods to assess graft-versus-host disease. Our national multicenter randomized controlled trial involved seven Belgian transplantation centers and 78 healthcare professionals selected using a two-stage convenience sampling approach between January and April 2017. Using a 1:1 randomization stratified by profession , healthcare professionals were assigned to use either the App ( `` APP & '') or their usual graft-versus-host disease assessment aids ( `` No APP '') to assess the diagnosis and severity score of ten expert-validated clinical vignettes. Our main outcome measure was the difference in accuracy for graft-versus-host disease severity scoring between both groups. The odds of being correct were 6.14 ( 95 % CI: 2.83-13.34) and 6.29 ( 95 % CI: 4.32-9.15) times higher in favor of the `` APP '' group for diagnosis and scoring , respectively ( p < 0.001). App-assisted graft-versus-host disease severity scoring was significantly superior for both acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease , with an Odds Ratio of 17.89 and 4.34 respectively ( p < 0.001) and showed a significantly increased inter-observer agreement compared to standard practice. Despite a mean increase of 24 minutes ( 95 % CI: 20.45-26.97) in time needed to score the whole graft-versus-host disease test package in the `` APP '' group ( p < 0.001) , usability feedback was positive. The eGVHD App showed superior graft-versus-host disease assessment accuracy compared to standard practice and has the potential to improve the quality of outcome data registration in allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
