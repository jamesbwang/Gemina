  We present the rank-reduced full configuration interaction ( RR-FCI) method , a variational approach for the calculation of extremely large full configuration interaction ( FCI) wave functions. In this report , we show that RR-FCI can provide ground state singlet and triplet energies within kcal/mol accuracy of full CI ( FCI) with computational effort scaling as the square root of the number of determinants in the CI space ( compared to conventional FCI methods which scale linearly with the number of determinants). Fast graphical processing unit ( GPU) accelerated projected σ = Hc matrix-vector product formation enables calculations with configuration spaces as large as 30 electrons in 30 orbitals , corresponding to an FCI calculation with over 2.4 × 10
