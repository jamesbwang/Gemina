  To investigate the contamination of zearalenone in food in Shaanxi Province , and to assess the dietary zearalenone exposure and the health risk of intaking zearalenone from corn products for Shaanxi residents. In 2013-2016 , samples of five kinds of food including grains , vegetable oil , liquor and infants ' food were collected randomly from ten cities , and determined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Dietary intake assessment of human exposure to zearalenone was carried out in combination of food consumption data with concentration of zearalenone. 1193 samples were detected zearalenone and the total detection rate was 17. 27 % , with the mean value of 13. 5 Î¼g/kg. Among all food samples , oil products were more seriously polluted than other kinds of foods , its detection rate was 79. 37 %. And 12 samples of grain products exceed the standard , the exceeding standard rate was 1. 64 % , which were all corn products. The level of zearalenone detected in wheat flour , rice , millet , beer and bakery products was low. The overall level of zearalenone contamination inmarket food is common , but corn products may be the severely contaminated foods with zearalenone in Shaanxi Province. The risk assessmentresult suggests that the current dietary intake of zearalenone from corn products in Shaanxi Province has no appreciable effect on health , however , the concentrations of zearalenone in corn products are relatively high , and need to be monitored in the future.
