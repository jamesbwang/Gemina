  Emerging trends in neurosciences are providing converging evidence that cortical networks in predominantly motor areas are activated in several contexts related to ` action ' that do not cause any overt movement. Indeed for any complex body , human or embodied robot inhabiting unstructured environments , the dual processes of shaping motor output during action execution and providing the self with information related to feasibility , consequence and understanding of potential actions ( of oneself/others) must seamlessly alternate during goal-oriented behaviors , social interactions. While prominent approaches like Optimal Control , Active Inference converge on the role of forward models , they diverge on the underlying computational basis. In this context , revisiting older ideas from motor control like the Equilibrium Point Hypothesis and synergy formation , this article offers an alternative perspective emphasizing the functional role of a ` plastic , configurable ' internal representation of the body ( body-schema) as a critical link enabling the seamless continuum between motor control and imagery. With the central proposition that both `` real and imagined '' actions are consequences of an internal simulation process achieved though passive goal-oriented animation of the body schema , the computational/neural basis of muscleless motor synergies ( and ensuing simulated actions without movements) is explored. The rationale behind this perspective is articulated in the context of several interdisciplinary studies in motor neurosciences ( for example , intracranial depth recordings from the parietal cortex , FMRI studies highlighting a shared cortical basis for action ` execution , imagination and understanding ') , animal cognition ( in particular , tool-use and neuro-rehabilitation experiments , revealing how coordinated tools are incorporated as an extension to the body schema) and pertinent challenges towards building cognitive robots that can seamlessly `` act , interact , anticipate and understand '' in unstructured natural living spaces.
