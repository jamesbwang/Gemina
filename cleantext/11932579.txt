  The aim of this study was to compare the actual deadlift one repetition maximum ( 1RM) and the deadlift 1RM predicted from individualised load-velocity profiles. Twelve moderately resistance-trained men participated in three deadlift sessions. During the first , 1RM was assessed; during the second , load-velocity profiles were recorded with six loads ( 65 % to 90 % 1RM) using a linear position transducer recording at 1000 Hz; and during the third , minimal velocity thresholds ( MVT) were recorded from the velocity of the last repetition during sets to volitional fatigue<symptom> with 70 % and 80 % 1RM with a linear position transducer recording at 1000 Hz. Regression was then used to generate individualised load-velocity profiles and the MVT was used as a cut-off value from which to predict deadlift 1RM. In general , velocity reliability was poor to moderate. More importantly , predicted deadlift 1RMs were significantly and meaningfully less than actual deadlift 1RMs (
