  It has been shown that nuclear expression of S100A4 is significantly correlated with increased metastasis and reduced survival in patients with gastric cancer and many other cancers. However , the factors which could influence the nuclear contents of S100A4 in cancer cells are not clear. It has also been reported that Interleukin-1β ( IL-1β) promotes the nuclear translocation of S100A4 in chondrocytes. Previous studies have shown that IL-1β promotes the stemness of colon cancer cells , and S100A4 is also involved in maintaining cancer-initiating cells in head and neck cancers. We speculate that IL-1β might promote the nuclear translocation of S100A4 protein in MGC803 gastric cancer cells and therefore enhance their stem-like properties. The results from Western-blot and qRT-PCR analysis showed that IL-1β increased the nuclear and total cellular content of S100A4 protein and S100A4 mRNA level in MGC803 cells. LY294002 , a pharmacological inhibitor of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K) reversed the above effects. Functional studies indicated that IL-1β promoted the colony-forming and spheroid-forming capabilities of the cells and the expression of SOX2 and NANOG gene. PI3K or S100A4 inhibition reversed the IL-1β-mediated increase in colony and spheroid-forming capabilities of the cells. LY294002 also reversed the elevated SOX2 and NANOG expression induced by IL-1β. Our study demonstrated that IL-1β promote the nuclear translocation of S100A4 protein in gastric cancer cells MGC803 , which are PI3K dependent , suggesting the existence of IL-1β-PI3K-S100A4 pathway for the first time. The study also showed that IL-1β promoted stem-like properties of the cells through the new pathway.
