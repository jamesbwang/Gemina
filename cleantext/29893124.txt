  The electrochemical behavior of a synthetic oligonucleotide , thrombin-binding aptamer ( TBA , 15-mer) , was explored at a liquid-organogel microinterface array. TBA did not display any response when only background electrolytes were present in both phases. On the basis of literature reports that surfactants can influence nucleic acid detection , the response in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium ( CTA
