  The autologous , synthetic , and animal-derived grafts currently used as scaffolds for tissue replacement have limitations due to low availability , poor biocompatibility , and cost. Plant tissues have favorable characteristics that make them uniquely suited for use as scaffolds , such as high surface area , excellent water transport and retention , interconnected porosity , preexisting vascular networks , and a wide range of mechanical properties. Two successful methods of plant decellularization for tissue engineering applications are described here. The first method is based on detergent baths to remove cellular matter , which is similar to previously established methods used to clear mammalian tissues. The second is a detergent-free method adapted from a protocol that isolates leaf vasculature and involves the use of a heated bleach and salt bath to clear the leaves and stems. Both methods yield scaffolds with comparable mechanical properties and low cellular metabolic impact , thus allowing the user to select the protocol which better suits their intended application.
