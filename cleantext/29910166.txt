  To investigate the impact of random survival forest<disease> ( RSF) classifier trained by radiomics features over the prediction of the overall survival of patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC). The dynamic computed tomography data of 127 patients ( 97 men , 30 women; mean age , 68 years) newly diagnosed with resectable HCC were retrospectively analyzed. After manually setting the region of interest to include the tumor within the slice at its maximum diameter , texture analyses were performed with or without a Laplacian of Gaussian filter. Using the extracted 96 histogram based texture features , RSFs were trained using 5-fold cross-validation to predict the individual risk for each patient on disease free survival ( DFS) and overall survival ( OS). The associations between individual risk and DFS or OS were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The effects of the predicted individual risk and clinical variables upon OS were analyzed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Among the 96 histogram based texture features , RSF extracted 8 of high importance for DFS and 15 for OS. The RSF trained by these features distinguished two patient groups with high and low predicted individual risk ( P = 1.1 Ã— 10 The combination of radiomics analysis and RSF might be useful in predicting the prognosis of patients with resectable HCC.
