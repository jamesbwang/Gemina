  BACKGROUND Lidocaine is widely used as a general and local anesthetic in minor or major surgeries. The objective of the study was to compare postoperative pain relief and adverse events using different forms of lidocaine administration in patients following closed nasal bone reduction surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 381 patients with a solitary nasal fracture that could be managed with closed reduction were included in this study and divided into 3 groups of 127 patients in each group. Patients had received 1 % lidocaine HCl with epinephrine ( LL group) , inserted a mesh impregnated with lidocaine spray ( TL group) , or 1 mg/kg/h lidocaine infusion ( GL group) before surgeries. Patients also received morphine when the pain was not controlled. The postoperative pain was assessed at 6 hours and 48 hours after surgery. Postoperative vomiting<symptom> and nausea<symptom> were evaluated. Repeated ANOVA/Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test was performed at 95 % confidence level. RESULTS At 6 hours after surgery , patients in the general lidocaine ( GL) group reported decreased postoperative pain compared with those in the topical lidocaine ( TL) group ( P < 0.001 , q = 6.633) and LL group ( P < 0.001 , q = 8.056). The morphine consumption within 48 hours was least in GL group than TL group ( P < 0.001 , q = 172.9) and LL group ( P < 0.001 , q = 226.42). Lidocaine infusion caused nausea<symptom> ( P < 0.001 , q = 6.742) and vomiting<symptom> ( P < 0.001 , q = 4.306). CONCLUSIONS Topical lidocaine anesthesia had the same postoperative pain relief and the least adverse events as local and general lidocaine anesthesia.
