  Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> infection stimulates a type I interferon ( IFN) response in host cells , which suppresses viral replication. Type I IFNs exert antiviral effects by inducing the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes ( ISGs). To screen for antiviral ISGs that restricted Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> replication , we individually knocked out 21 ISGs in A549 lung cancer cells and identified PARP12 as a strong inhibitor of Zika<pathogen> virus<pathogen> replication. Our findings suggest that PARP12 mediated the ADP-ribosylation of NS1 and NS3 , nonstructural viral proteins that are involved in viral replication and modulating host defense responses. This modification of NS1 and NS3 triggered their proteasome-mediated degradation. These data increase our understanding of the antiviral activity of PARP12 and suggest a molecular basis for the potential development of therapeutics against
