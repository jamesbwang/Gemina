  Herein , we present a novel ( 3 + 2) cycloaddition reaction of β-keto esters with nitrile oxides , which were generated in situ from copper carbene and tert-butyl nitrite. This three-component reaction provides new methodology for the direct synthesis of fully substituted isoxazole derivatives , featuring mild reaction conditions , readily accessible starting materials and simple operation. The experimental studies and DFT calculations suggest that the reaction starts with the generation of the key intermediate nitrile oxides , followed by a ( 3 + 2) cycloaddition reaction of β-keto esters to give the final isoxazole products.
