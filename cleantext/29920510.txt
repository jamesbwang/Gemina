  Although breakthrough dyspnea<symptom> is very frequent in cancer patients , there are no precise recommendations for treating it. The main objective of this study was to analyze what treatments are used in clinical practice for the management of breakthrough dyspnea<symptom> in cancer patients in Spain and the secondary objectives were to describe the characteristics of cancer patients with breakthrough dyspnea<symptom> and the attributes of the disorder. Cancer patients over 18 years of age , with breakthrough dyspnea<symptom> and a Karnofsky performance score of â‰¥ 30 , who were treated at departments of oncology in institutes across Spain were included in this cross-sectional observational study. The characteristics of breakthrough dyspnea<symptom> , history of treatment , anthropometric variables , Mahler dyspnea<symptom> index , Borg scale , Edmonton Symptoms Assessment Scale , and patient satisfaction with current breakthrough dyspnea<symptom> treatment were assessed. The mean age of the 149 included patients was 66 years ( 95 % confidence interval: 64.3 to 67.9) , and 53 were females ( 35.6 %). The mean breakthrough dyspnea<symptom> intensity was 5.85 ( 95 % confidence interval 5.48 to 6.22 , Borg scale). A total of 55.1 % of the first-choice treatments consisted of opioids , followed by oxygen ( 17.3 %). A total of 119 patients ( 79.9 %) received monotherapy for breakthrough dyspnea<symptom>. Patients presenting with basal dyspnea<symptom> received oxygen in a greater proportion of cases ( 21.1 % vs 7.4 %; p = 0.07). Patients with predictable dyspnea<symptom> received a greater proportion of opioids ( 70.9 % vs 44.4 %; p = 0.01). Opioids constitute first-line therapy for breakthrough dyspnea<symptom> in routine clinical practice , though the scientific evidence supporting their use is scarce. Further information derived from controlled clinical trials is needed regarding the comparative efficacy of the different treatments in order to justify their use.
