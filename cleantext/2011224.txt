  Decompression of an anomalous vertebral artery ( VA) may effectively treat cervical myelopathy/radiculopathy due to resultant spinal cord or nerve compression. Here we report a case of C2 radiculopathy induced by neck flexion due to cord compression of the C2 segmental type VA relieved by microvascular decompression. A 30-year-old female presented with left occipitalgia , sensory abnormalities in the left upper and lower extremities , and neck<symptom> pain<symptom> induced by neck flexion. The magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) revealed an abnormal flow void , confirming that the VA was compressing the spinal cord at the C1 level. Three-dimensional computed tomography ( 3D-CT) showed an anomalous course of the left VA , which entered the spinal canal between the axis and atlas. Microvascular decompression was performed by transposing the artery ( e.g. , anchoring it to the dura using PTEF): this effectively relieved cord compression. An anomalous VA rarely causes cervical radiculopathy induced by neck flexion. When it occurs , microvascular decompression effectively relieves pressure resulting in a resolution of symptoms.
