  In recent years , there has been a growing , widespread interest in tissue regeneration , with all its medical and social implications , such as , for example , the recovery from illness and wellbeing of humans. Yet , some of the most noticeable features of regeneration were discovered using a purely biological perspective with experimental biology on animal models. We are proud to introduce this Special Issue of The International Journal of Developmental Biology ( Int. J. Dev. Biol.) on Regeneration Biology , which is devoted to the different animal models currently used to study regeneration. We also have tailored this Special Issue to include the different achievements that are today the state-of-the art in tissue and organ regeneration. The animal model perspective allows us to identify common and specific traits , summarize the most relevant advances , establish knowledge for the new `` kids-on-the-block '' and provide a framework to explore the open questions that researchers in the field are pursuing.
