  To predict the occurrence of inactive disease in JIA in the first 2 years of disease. An inception cohort of 152 treatment-na√Øve JIA patients with disease duration < 6 months was analysed. Potential predictors were baseline clinical variables , joint US , gut microbiota composition and a panel of inflammation-related compounds in blood plasma. Various algorithms were employed to predict inactive disease according to Wallace criteria at 6-month intervals in the first 2 years. Performance of the models was evaluated using the split-cohort technique. The cohort was analysed in its entirety , and separate models were developed for oligoarticular patients , polyarticular RF negative patients and ANA positive patients. All models analysing the cohort as a whole showed poor performance in test data ( area under the curve ( AUC): < 0.65). The subgroup models performed better. Inactive disease was predicted by lower baseline juvenile arthritis<disease> DAS ( JADAS) -71 and lower relative abundance of the operational taxonomic unit Mogibacteriaceae for oligoarticular patients ( AUC in test data: 0.69); shorter duration of morning stiffness , higher haemoglobin and lower CXCL-9 levels at baseline for polyarticular RF negative patients ( AUC in test data: 0.69); and shorter duration of morning stiffness and higher baseline haemoglobin for ANA positive patients ( AUC in test data: 0.72). Inactive disease could not be predicted with satisfactory accuracy in the whole cohort , likely due to disease heterogeneity. Interesting predictors were found in more homogeneous subgroups. These need to be validated in future studies.
