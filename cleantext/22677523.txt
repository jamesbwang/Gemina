  TiO ₂- SnS ₂ composite semiconducting photocatalysts with different building component ratios were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis ( TiO ₂- SnS ₂- HT) and by immobilization of commercial TiO ₂ and SnS ₂ particles ( TiO ₂- SnS ₂- COMM). The band gap values , which determine the catalysts & rsquo; photoactivity , were examined by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and Kubelka ⁻ Munk transformations. The catalysts & rsquo; surface properties: specific surface area , charge and adsorption capacitance at the solid ⁻ solution interface were characterized using BET analysis , potentiometric titration and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy , respectively. The electronic band structure of TiO ₂- SnS ₂ photocatalyst , as the key property for the solar-driven photocatalysis , was deduced from the thermodynamic data and the semiconducting parameters ( type of semiconductivity , concentration of the charge carriers , flat band potential) obtained by Mott ⁻ Schottky analysis. The photoactivity of both composites was studied in photocatalytic treatment of diclofenac ( DCF) under simulated solar irradiation and was compared to the benchmark photocatalyst ( TiO ₂ P25) activity. The influence of process parameters , such as pH , H ₂ O ₂ , and composite formulation on the effectiveness of DCF removal and conversion was investigated and discussed by employing response surface modeling ( RSM) approach. The photocatalytic efficiency of both composite materials was discussed on the basis of the hetereojunction formation that facilitated the photoelectron transfer , promoting more efficient photocatalytic degradation of DCF.
