  We investigated whether trimers of serine , threonine , tyrosine , and phenylalanine which may interact with water molecules and ice , show anti-ice nucleation activity. Only tyrosine trimer had high levels of anti-ice nucleation activity ( 10.10 ± 0.74 ℃) at a final concentration of 0.2 mM. This was constant at an activity of 2.0 ℃ between the 0.01-0.1 mM concentrations , and rapidly increased at 0.1 mM or more. At the final concentration of 0.2 mM or more , the activity of the tyrosine trimer was almost constant ( from 9.2 ℃ to 10.2 ℃). Although it is lower than the activity against silver iodide , the tyrosine trimer showed an effect on the activity of the ice nucleating bacteria. This is the first report that revealed that trimer of amino acid , especially tyrosine has the supercooling-facilitating activity.
