  Coenzyme A ( CoA) esters of short fatty acids ( acyl-CoAs) function as key precursors for the biosynthesis of various natural products and the dominant donors for lysine acylation. Herein , we investigated the functional interplay between beneficial and adverse effects of acyl-CoA supplements on the production of acyl-CoA-derived natural products in microorganisms by using erythromycin-biosynthesized Saccharopolyspora erythraea as a model: accumulation of propionyl-CoA benefited erythromycin biosynthesis , but lysine propionylation inhibited the activities of important enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways of erythromycin. The results showed that the overexpression of NAD
