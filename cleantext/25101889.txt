  Central tolerance checkpoints are critical for the elimination of autoreactive B cells and the prevention of autoimmunity. When autoreactive B cells encounter their Ag at the immature B cell stage , BCR cross-linking induces receptor editing , followed by apoptosis if edited cells remain autoreactive. Although the transcription factor Foxo1 is known to promote receptor editing , the role of the related factor Foxo3 in central B cell tolerance is poorly understood. We find that BCR-stimulated immature B cells from Foxo3-deficient mice demonstrate reduced apoptosis compared with wild type cells. Despite this , Foxo3
