  High intensity interval training ( HIIT) is known to be an effective exercise training regimen to improve energy substrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity. However , the underlying mechanisms of improvement in insulin sensitivity due to HIIT have not yet been fully clarified. C1q/TNF-related protein ( CTRP) 1 and CTRP9 , which are adiponectin paralogs and novel adipokines , have favorable effects on energy substrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a single bout of HIIT on CTRP1 and CTRP9 secretions in healthy men. Eight healthy male subjects ( mean ± standard error: age , 23.4 ± 1.1 years; height , 172.1 ± 1.7 cm; body mass , 68.0 ± 2.0 kg; BMI , 22.9 ± 0.5 kg/m2) participated in this study. They performed a single bout of HIIT consisted of four 30-s maximal cycling bouts with 4-min rest between bouts using a cycle ergometer. Blood samples were collected before the exercise , at 0 ( immediately after the exercise) , 15 , 30 , and 120 min after the single bout of HIIT. Serum CTRP1 , CTRP9 , and high-molecular-weight ( HMW) adiponectin concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosolvent assay kits. CTRP1 concentration significantly increased at 120 min after the HIIT. CTRP9 concentration also significantly increased immediately after the single bout of HIIT. In contrast , there were no significant differences in HMW adiponectin concentration before and after the acute HIIT. These findings suggest that a single bout of HIIT may stimulate CTRP1 and CTRP9 secretions in healthy men.
