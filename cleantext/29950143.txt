  Bone-regulating hormones and nutrients play an important role in influencing metabolic health. The aim of this study was to determine whether bone-regulating hormones and nutrients , such as parathyroid hormone ( PTH) , 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD) , and magnesium ( Mg) could be used to characterize the metabolically healthy obese ( MHO) phenotype. This study included 27 overweight or obese participants ( 14 men/13 women) classified as MHO ( n = 14) or metabolically unhealthy obese ( MUO) ( n = 13) based on the presence or absence of metabolic abnormalities , determined by percentage body fat , percentage trunk fat , and waist circumference. Biochemical ( serum concentrations of hormones and cytokines such as PTH , 25OHD , ionized Mg ( iMg) , cytokines , lipids , glycemic indices) , physiological ( percentage body fat , percentage trunk fat , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP)) , and dietary intake ( Mg intake , calcium intake) measurements were obtained. Serum PTH concentrations were significantly lower ( p = 0.005) in the MHO group ( 39.68 ± 11.06 pg/mL) compared with the MUO group ( 63.78 ± 25.82 pg/mL). Serum iMg concentrations were higher ( p = 0.052) in the MHO group ( 0.565 ± 0.41 mmol/L) than in the MUO group ( 0.528 ± 0.050 mmol/L). Serum concentrations of osteocalcin were also higher ( 10.37 ± 3.70 ng/mL) in the MHO compared with the MUO ( 6.51 ± 4.14 ng/mL) group ( p = 0.017). The MHO group had significantly lower serum insulin concentrations ( p = 0.006) and diastolic BP ( p = 0.035). Concentrations of serum 25OHD , total triglycerides , C-reactive protein and systolic BP did not differ between groups. These findings suggest that bone-regulating hormones and nutrients , especially serum PTH , osteocalcin concentrations , and dietary Mg intakes , can help to characterize the MHO phenotype.
