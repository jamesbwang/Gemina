  Store-operated channels activated in response to intracellular calcium store depletion represent the main pathway of calcium entry from the extracellular space in nonelectroexcitable cells. Adapter proteins organize the components of this system into integral complex. We studied the influence of adapter proteins of the Homer family on endogenous store-operated calcium Imin channels in A431 cells. Monomeric Homer 1a proteins increase activity of Imin channels , but did not modulate their electrophysiological properties. Recombinant Homer 1c protein did not block the induced calcium currents.
