  The extensive heterogeneity both between and within the medulloblastoma ( MB) subgroups underscores a critical need for variant-specific biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. We previously identified a role for the CD271/p75 neurotrophin receptor ( p75NTR) in regulating stem/progenitor cells in the SHH MB subgroup. Here we demonstrate the utility of CD271 as a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker for SHH MB using immunohistochemical analysis and transcriptome data across 763 primary tumors. RNA sequencing of CD271 + and CD271- cells revealed molecularly distinct , co-existing cellular subsets both in vitro and in vivo. MAPK/ERK signaling was upregulated in the CD271 + population , and inhibiting this pathway reduced endogenous CD271 levels , stem/progenitor cell proliferation , and cell survival as well as cell migration in vitro. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib extended survival and reduced CD271 levels in vivo; whereas , treatment with vismodegib , a well-known smoothened ( SMO) inhibitor currently in clinical trials for the treatment of recurrent SHH medulloblastoma , had no significant effect in our models. Our study demonstrates the clinical utility of CD271 as both a diagnostic and prognostic tool for SHH MB tumors and reveals a novel role for MEK inhibitors in targeting CD271 + SHH MB cells.
