  MIS416 is a microparticulate formulation derived from propionibacterium<pathogen> acnes cell wall skeletons with intrinsic adjuvant activity. Conjugates of MIS416-SS-peptide containing a disulfide linkage facilitate the cytoplasmic delivery and release of peptides in antigen-presenting cells ( APCs). We hypothesized that MIS416-siRNA ( small interfering RNA) conjugates , containing a disulfide linkage between MIS416 and the siRNA , would allow cytoplasmic release of siRNA in APCs. MIS416-SS-siStat3 conjugates added to cell culture medium of monolayers of DCs in culture flasks successfully targeted Stat3 mRNA in DCs in vitro without transfection , downregulating Stat3 mRNA and protein levels. These results suggest that MIS416-SS-siRNA conjugates can be used as a novel siRNA delivery system for the knockdown of mRNA levels in APCs.
