  It has been postulated that catheter-based renal denervation ( RDN) may lower blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) and improve severity of obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA) in resistant hypertensive patients. The aim of our study ( NCT01366625) was to investigate in a prospective randomized trial the effect of RDN on BP and clinical course of OSA. Sixty patients with true resistant hypertension coexisting with moderate-to-severe OSA ( apnea/hypopnea index , â‰¥ 15) were randomly allocated to RDN group ( 30 patients) and to control group ( 30 patients). The primary end point was reduction in office systolic BP at 3 months. Secondary end points included reduction in diastolic office and ambulatory BP , change in apnea/hypopnea index and biochemical measurements at 3 months , and change in echocardiographic measurements at 6 months. There were no differences in clinical characteristics between the groups. At 3 months in the RDN group , both office and ambulatory BP were significantly reduced , and a significant decrease in OSA severity ( apnea/hypopnea index , 39.4 versus 31.2 events per hour; URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.
