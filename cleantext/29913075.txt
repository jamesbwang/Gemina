  Circadian and circannual rhythms influence not only the environment , but also human physiology. In times of increasing numbers of couples struggling with infertility<symptom> , and thus increasing demand for successful assisted reproduction , the aim of our study was to evaluate circadian and circannual rhythms and their association with semen quality. A total of 12 245 semen samples from 7068 men , collected at the andrology laboratory of the Department of Reproductive Endocrinology , University Hospital Zurich , between 1994 and 2015 , were uniformly analysed in terms of sperm concentration , total sperm count , progressive<symptom> motility<symptom> and normal morphology. On the basis of these four parameters , we retrospectively examined the circadian and circannual changes of semen quality. The Mann-Whitney U test and multiple linear regression analysis were used for the statistical evaluation. The semen samples collected in the early morning before 7:30 a.m. showed the highest levels in sperm concentration , total sperm count and normal morphology , all with statistical significance. Progressive<symptom> motility<symptom> did not show any significant alterations based on circadian rhythm. Furthermore , a significant increase in sperm concentration and total sperm count was found in spring , with significant decreases in the summer. The highest percentage of normal morphology was found in summer. For progressive<symptom> motility<symptom> , no significant seasonal variation could be demonstrated. Male semen quality varies with both circadian and circannual rhythms. Collection of semen in the early morning , where semen quality was highest , can be used to improve natural fertility as well as fertility resulting from assisted reproduction.
