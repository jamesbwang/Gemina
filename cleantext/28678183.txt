  Various measurement monitoring techniques are investigated to mitigate the effect of global navigation satellite systems ( GNSS) code multipath through error correction , stochastic weighting of measurements and detection and exclusion ( or de-weighting) of affected measurements. Following a comprehensive review of each approach , the paper focuses on detection/exclusion and detection/de-weighting techniques where several single and dual-frequency monitoring metrics are employed in a combination with time-averaging and the
