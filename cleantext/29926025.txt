  Humans have been exposed to solar UV radiation since their appearance on Earth and evolution has enabled most individuals to adapt to this exposure , to some degree. UV radiation produces several deleterious effects in human skin and light-skinned individuals are at greatest risk for both acute and long-term negative effects such as DNA damage , sunburn , immune suppression and skin cancer. The benefits of photoadaptation , which leads to a decreased response after acclimatization , are that humans who have skin that is capable of photoadaptation can work and play in the sun with reduced fear of painful sunburn. However , the effects of photoadaptation on DNA damage and development of skin cancer are quite complex and less well-understood. In this article , we have reviewed the current state of knowledge of UVR photoadaptation in human skin. However , more studies are needed to explore the use of UVR photoadaptation to protect against critical endpoints , such as skin cancer.
