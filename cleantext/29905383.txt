  Previous global studies of guselkumab have demonstrated clinical benefits in patients with psoriasis. The aim of this 52-week , phase 3 study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of guselkumab in Japanese patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis. Patients randomly received guselkumab 50 mg or 100 mg at weeks 0 , 4 and every 8 weeks , or placebo with cross-over to guselkumab 50 mg or 100 mg at week 16. Co-primary end-points were the proportion of patients achieving Investigator 's Global Assessment ( IGA) cleared/minimal ( 0/1) and 90 % or more improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI-90) at week 16. Overall , 192 patients were randomized to placebo , guselkumab 50 mg or 100 mg. At week 16 , patients in the placebo group were crossed over to guselkumab 50 mg or 100 mg. At week 16 , a significantly ( P < 0.001) higher proportion of patients receiving guselkumab 50 mg and 100 mg versus placebo achieved IGA 0/1 ( 92.3 % and 88.9 % vs 7.8 %) and PASI-90 ( 70.8 % and 69.8 % vs 0 %). Patients in guselkumab 50 mg and 100 mg groups achieved significant improvement versus placebo in PASI-75 ( 89.2 % and 84.1 % vs 6.3 % , P < 0.001) at week 16; improvement was maintained through week 52. Incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events were comparable among the groups through week 16; the most commonly reported was nasopharyngitis. No new safety concerns were observed until week 52. In conclusion , guselkumab treatment demonstrated superior efficacy over placebo and was well tolerated in Japanese patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis.
