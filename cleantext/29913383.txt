  A series of carbazole-triazole conjugates were designed , synthesized and characterized by IR , NMR , and HRMS spectra. Biological assay showed that most of the synthesized compounds exhibited moderate and even strong antifungal activities , especially 3,6-dibromocarbazolyl triazole 5d displayed excellent inhibitory efficacy against most of the tested fungal strains ( MIC = 2-32 μg/mL) and effectively fungicidal ability towards C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> , C. tropicals and C.<pathogen> parapsilosis<pathogen> ATCC 22019 ( MFC = 4-8 μg/mL). Its combination use with fluconazole could enhance the antifungal efficacy , and compound 5d also did not obviously trigger the development of resistance in C.<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> even after 10 passages. Preliminary mechanism study revealed that the active molecule 5d could depolarize fungal membrane potential and intercalate into DNA to possibly block DNA replication , thus possibly exhibiting its powerful antifungal abilities. Conjugate 5d could interact with HSA , which was constructive for the further design , modification and screening of drug molecules. Docking investigation demonstrated a non-covalent binding of 5d with CYP51 through hydrogen bond and hydrophobicity. These results strongly suggested that compound 5d could act as a potential template for the development of promising antifungal drugs.
