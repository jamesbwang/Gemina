  Compared to traditional morphological identification , DNA barcoding-molecular identification based on sequencing of a segment of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ( COI)- provides a shortcut to authenticating chelonian identifications. Here , we selected 63 government-seized chelonian specimens deposited at Taipei Zoo for DNA barcoding analysis. DNA barcoding and subsequent phylogenetic analysis successfully authenticated 36 chelonian species , including five that are listed in CITES Appendix I. Approximately 90 % ( 57/63) of the specimens were successfully authenticated by our molecular approach , but lack or error of BOLD reference sequences , biological processes such as hybridization , and uncertain species delimitation all reduced the accuracy of DNA barcoding. In order to increase the accuracy of DNA barcoding , Taipei Zoo will continue to enrich the BOLD database and also establish a genetic database , to include additional genetic markers , by using government-seized chelonian specimens. A fast and accurate method to authenticate seized samples could assist law enforcement agencies to prosecute criminals and restrict illegal exploitation of wild chelonian resources.
