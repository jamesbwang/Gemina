  Multiple myeloma ( MM) is characterized by the decreased osteogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs). Communication between cancer cells and cancer stromal cells is a driving factor in tumor progression. Understanding the myeloma-stroma interactions is critical to the development of effective strategies that can reverse bone diseases. Here we identified that bioactive lncRNA RUNX2-AS1 in myeloma cells could be packed into exosomes and transmitted to MSCs , thus repressing the osteogenesis of MSCs. RUNX2-AS1 , which arises from the antisense strand of RUNX2 , was enriched in MSCs derived from MM patients ( MM-MSCs). RUNX2-AS1 was capable of forming an RNA duplex with RUNX2 pre-mRNA at overlapping regions and this duplex transcriptionally repressed RUNX2 expression by reducing the splicing efficiency , resulting in decreased osteogenic potential of MSCs. In vivo mouse models , administered an inhibitor of exosome secretion , GW4869 , was found to be effective in preventing bone loss , sustained by both bone formation and anticatabolic activities. Therefore , exosomal lncRNA RUNX2-AS1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for bone lesions<symptom> in MM. In summary , our results indicated a key role of exosomal lncRUNX2-AS1 in transferring from MM cells to MSCs in osteogenic differentiation , through a unique exosomal lncRUNX2-AS1/ RUNX2 pathway.
