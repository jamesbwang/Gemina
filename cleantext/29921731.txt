  Cancer-associated fibroblasts ( CAFs) in the tumor microenvironment ( TME) play a central role in tumor progression. We investigated whether CAFs can regulate tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs) and their role in tumor immunosuppression. 140 cases of esophageal cancer were analyzed for CAFs and CD8 CD8 CAFs regulate immunosuppressive TIL populations in the TME via IL-6. IL-6 blockade , or targeting CAFs , may improve pre-existing tumor immunity and enhance the efficacy of conventional immunotherapies.
