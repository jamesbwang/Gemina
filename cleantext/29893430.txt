  The diagnosis of cutaneous γδ T-cell lymphoma ( GDTCL) requires the identification of γδ chains of the T-cell receptor ( TCR). Our aim in this study was , by using a new monoclonal antibody ( mAb) against TCRδ , to evaluate TCRδ expression in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE) skin tissue from TCRγ + cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL) , and to assess TCRδ expression within a spectrum of other cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders ( CLPDs). Twelve cases ( 10 patients) with TCRγ + CTCL and 132 additional CLPD cases ( 127 patients) were examined , including mycosis<disease> fungoides ( MF) ( n = 60) , cutaneous GDTCL ( n = 15) , subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma ( SPTCL) ( n = 11) , and CD30 mAb H-41 against TCRδ matches TCRγ in immunostaining FFPE tissues from GDTCL , supporting H-41 as a replacement for mAb γ3 .20. TCRδ expression in our study suggests that the true occurrence of γδ + non-GDTCL CTCL/CLPD may be lower than suggested by the recent literature.
