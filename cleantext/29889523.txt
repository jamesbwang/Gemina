  We prepared a pair with a visible-absorbing donor dye and a near-infrared fluorescing acceptor dye. The donor and the acceptor were covalently linked close enough for FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer to occur. Under cryogenic conditions at 1.7 K , we observed the fluorescence excitation spectra of the individual pairs in a water matrix. We tested one rhodamine , two Bodipy , and one carbopyronine derivatives as the donor. Among these donors , Bodipy derivatives show the narrowest spectral width of the individuals with respect to the ensemble width. Thus , Bodipy dyes were favorable as the donor for the spectral selection of individual pairs. At 1.7 K , from the several Bodipy-acceptor pairs in the diffraction-limited volume , an individual pair was selected by the fluorescence excitation spectrum of the donor. The spectrally selected pair was localized using the near-infrared fluorescence of the acceptor.
