  The experience of psychological distress is prevalent in people with multiple sclerosis ( MS) , including high levels of stress , anxiety<symptom> , and depression<symptom> It has been shown that people with MS use less adaptive coping compared with healthy individuals. This study examined the ability of coping strategies to predict maladaptive and adaptive psychosocial outcomes across areas of stress , depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , and quality of life ( QOL) in people with MS. 107 people with MS completed measures of depression<symptom> ( Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory-II) , anxiety<symptom> ( State-Trait Anxiety<symptom> Inventory) , QOL ( Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54) , stress ( Daily Hassles Scale) , and coping ( COPE inventory). Consistent with expectations , depression<symptom> , frequency of stress , trait anxiety<symptom> , and mental health QOL were predicted by adaptive and maladaptive coping styles. Severity of stressful events was predicted by maladaptive , but not adaptive , coping styles. Depression<symptom> and mental health QOL were most prominently connected to coping use. Emotional preoccupation and venting showed the strongest relationship with poorer psychosocial outcomes , whereas positive reinterpretation and growth seemed to be most beneficial. The results of this study highlight the importance of intervention programs targeting specific coping strategies to enhance psychosocial adjustment for people with MS.
