  PDMS-PU ( polydimethylsiloxane-polyurethane) sponge decorated with In ( OH) 3 ( indium hydroxide) and BCP ( bromocresol purple) particles is shown to be a room-temperature ammonia<pathogen> sensor with high sensitivity and excellent reproducibility; it can accomplish real-time detection and monitoring of ammonia<pathogen> in the surrounding environment. The superhydrophobic and yellowish In ( OH) 3-BCP-TiO2-based ammonia-responsive ( IBT-AR) sponge changes to a purple superhydrophilic one when exposed to ammonia<pathogen> Notably , after reacting with ammonia<pathogen> , the sponge can recover its original wettability and color after heating in air. The wettability , color and absorption signal of IBT-AR sponge have been measured for sensing ammonia<pathogen> using the water contact angle , macroscopic observation and UV-vis absorption spectrometry , respectively. The minimum ammonia<pathogen> concentrations that can be detected by the sponge wettability , color and absorption signal are 0.5 % , 1.4 ppm and 50 ppb , respectively. This kind of sponge with smart wettability and color is a promising new ammonia<pathogen> detector.
