  Nitric oxide ( NO) has been shown to play an important role in renal physiology and pathophysiology partly through its influence on various transport systems in the kidney proximal tubule. The role of NO in kidney dysfunction associated with lysosomal storage disorder , cystinosis , is largely unknown. In the present study , the effects of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS)- specific inhibitor , 1400W , on Na
