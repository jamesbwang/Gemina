  In Italy , the National Health Service offers specialized evidence-based support to smokers who would like to quit through smoking cessation ( SC) services. We conducted a two-year prospective study , involving all 288 subjects treated for smoking cessation at the SC service of Reggio Emilia , to assess the association of referral sources and waiting times with the risk of treatment failure , by following participants up to one year after the quit date. We performed Cox-regression analysis , including demographic and smoking-related characteristics as confounding variables. The treatment failure rate at 12 months was 59.4 % ( 171/288) , including only 12 subjects lost to follow-up. The main mode of entry was self-referral ( 42.4 %) , followed by 32.6 % from general practice , 17.4 % from hospital and 7.6 % from other sources. Only 27.8 % participants were involved in the SC-program within 60 days of the first contact , as the guidelines suggest. The risk of treatment failure at 12 months showed little association with the type of referral source , while it correlated with waiting times & ge; 60 days ( hazard ratio = 1.59; 95 % confidence interval 1.10 ‚Åª 2.29). This study provides evidence of long-term high quit rates from a SC service , with few subjects lost to follow-up and biochemical verification of almost all abstinent subjects. Timeliness in care provision could further improve the outcome.
