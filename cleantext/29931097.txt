  While the majority of DNA is enclosed within the nucleus , the mitochondria also contain their own , separate DNA , the mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA). Mutations in mtDNA are associated with various<disease> human<disease> diseases<disease> , demonstrating the importance of mtDNA. Intensive studies over the last 18 years have demonstrated the presence of two distinct classes of mtDNA replication intermediates in mammals. One involves leading-strand DNA synthesis in the absence of synchronous lagging-strand DNA synthesis. Currently there are competing models in which the lagging-strand template is either systematically hybridized to processed mitochondrial transcripts , or coated with protein , until the lagging-strand DNA synthesis takes place. The other class of mtDNA replication intermediates has many properties of conventional , coupled leading- and lagging-strand DNA synthesis. Additionally , the highly unusual arrangement of DNA in human heart mitochondria suggests a third mechanism of replication. These findings indicate that the mtDNA replication systems of humans and other mammals are far more complex than previously thought , and thereby will require further research to understand the full picture of mtDNA replication.
