  Although neglected by classic niche theory , individual variation is now recognized as a prevalent phenomenon in nature with evolutionary and ecological relevance. Recent theory suggests that differences in individual variation across competitors can affect species coexistence and community patterns. However , the degree of individual variation is flexible across wild populations and we still know little about the ecological drivers of this variation across populations of single species and , especially , across coexisting species. Here , we aimed to ( a) elucidate the major drivers of individual niche variation in natural communities and ( b) to determine how consistent this variation is across coexisting species and communities. We analysed natural patterns of individual-level niche variation in four species of coexisting generalist frogs across a wide range of tropical communities. Specifically , we used gut contents and stable isotopes ( Î´
