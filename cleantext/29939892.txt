  The aim of the study was to evaluate knowledge about menopause and hormone therapy ( HT) among middle-aged Brazilian women and identify the factors associated with the level of knowledge. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 749 women aged 45 to 60 years , residing in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas , Brazil. The dependent variable was knowledge about menopause and HT evaluated using a numerical score based on the answers given to three questions that had several response options. The independent variables were sociodemographic characteristics , personal habits , and health conditions. Statistical analysis was carried out by Mann-Whitney , Kruskal-Wallis , and a generalized linear model. The mean age was 52.5 ( ± 4.4) years. Most of the women were postmenopausal ( 68 %) and 19.5 % had a history of current or previous use of HT. The final score for knowledge about menopause ranged from +1 to +11 , with a mean of 4.59 ( ± 1.86) and a median of 4. Women with higher levels of schooling ( coefficient = 0.64 , P < 0.001); with higher socioeconomic status ( coefficient = 0.47 , P < 0.002); with vaginal dryness ( coefficient = 0.47 , P = 0.003); who consumed alcohol ( coefficient = 0.61 , P = 0.006); who use or had ever used any type of treatment to counteract menopausal symptoms ( coefficient = 0.41 , P = 0.008); with anxiety<symptom> ( coefficient = 0.35 , P = 0.037); and with depression<symptom> ( coefficient = 0.31 , P = 0.043) possessed greater knowledge about menopause and HT. Women with a higher number ( ≥ 3) of vaginal deliveries ( coefficient = -0.61 , P < 0.001) and a higher body mass index ( coefficient = -0.02 , P = 0.046) possessed less knowledge about menopause and HT. The knowledge about menopause and HT demonstrated by the interviewees was low and possibly related to the time of exposure to qualified information.
