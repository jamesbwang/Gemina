  This study aimed to evaluate the effect of equine chorionic gonadotrophin ( eCG) stimulation prior to ovum pick-up ( OPU) on follicular development , number and quality of recovered oocytes , fertilization rate , and early embryo development in vitro. There were four OPU sessions ( cross over) conducted on 16 Braford cows to evaluate the effect of various eCG doses. The timing of the wave of ovarian follicular development was synchronized , and three days after , the respective eCG dose was administrated ( 0 , 200 , 400 , or 800 IU). The OPU was performed on Day 6 , and viable oocytes were used for IVM and IVF according to the respective treatment. After IVF treatment , the fertilization and cleavage rates , time of cleavage , and the cell number at 48 h were evaluated. There was no difference in the number of follicles , oocyte quantity , and morphological quality of oocytes among treatments ( P > 0.05). The oocyte recovery rate was similar among the eCG-treated groups , but was less than in the control group ( P < 0.01). The eCG800 group , however , had a greater recovery rate of follicles > 6 mm in diameter ( P < 0.01). In addition , the eCG800 group had a greater rate of normal fertilization ( P < 0.01) and lesser rate of polyspermy ( P < 0.02). The cleavage rate of the eCG800 group was greater than the other treatment groups but similar to that of the control. In conclusion , the use of eCG800 increased the proportion of follicles > 6 mm , with improved rate of normal fertilization and reduced occurrence of polyspermy , without affecting early embryonic development in vitro.
