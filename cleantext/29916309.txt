  Marginal structural models are causal models designed to adjust for time-dependent confounders in observational studies with dynamically adjusted treatments. They are robust tools to assess causality in complex longitudinal data. In this paper , a marginal structural model is proposed with an innovative dose-delay joint-exposure model for Inverse-Probability-of-Treatment Weighted estimation of the causal effect of alterations to the therapy intensity. The model is motivated by a precise clinical question concerning the possibility of reducing dosages in a regimen. It is applied to data from a randomised trial of chemotherapy in osteosarcoma , an aggressive primary bone-tumour. Chemotherapy data are complex because their longitudinal nature encompasses many clinical details like composition and organisation of multi-drug regimens , or dynamical therapy adjustments. This manuscript focuses on the clinical dynamical process of adjusting the therapy according to the patient 's toxicity history , and the causal effect on the outcome of interest of such therapy modifications. Depending on patients ' toxicity levels , variations to therapy intensity may be achieved by physicians through the allocation of either a reduction or a delay of the next planned dose. Thus , a negative feedback is present between exposure to cytotoxic agents and toxicity levels , which acts as time-dependent confounders. The construction of the model is illustrated highlighting the high complexity and entanglement of chemotherapy data. Built to address dosage reductions , the model also shows that delays in therapy administration should be avoided. The last aspect makes sense from the cytological point of view , but it is seldom addressed in the literature.
