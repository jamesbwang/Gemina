  A method for the determination of 5 kinds of phthalate monoesters in urine by solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was developed. After urine enzymatic hydrolysis by β-glucuronidase , the sample was pretreated by SPE. Phthalate monoesters were eluted by boron trifluoridemethanol complex , and determined by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer with DB-5 ms Phenomenex ( 30 m × 0. 25 mm , 0. 25 μm). Within the concentration range of25. 0-1000 μg/L , the relationship between peak area and concentration of 5 kinds of phthalate monoesters presented linear relation. The correlation coefficient was 0. 9989-0. 9996 , and the determination limit was 10. 0-15. 0 μg/L. The recoveries of phthalate monoesters were in the range of 80. 2 % -97. 8 % when set at 15. 0 , 200 and 500 μg/L concentration levels , and the relative standard deviation was in the range of 4. 2 % -10. 2 % ( n = 6). A total of 81 pregnant women were detected by this method and thedetection rate was 98. 7 %. This method could be used in the simultaneous determination of 5 kinds of phthalate monoesters.
