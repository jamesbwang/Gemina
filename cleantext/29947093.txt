  Light-induced release systems can be triggered remotely and are of interest for many controlled release applications due to the possibility for spatio-temporal release control. In this study a biotin-functionalized photocleavable macromer is incorporated with an o-nitrobenzyl moiety into gelatin methacryloyl (- acetyl) hydrogels via radical cross-linking. Stronger immobilization of streptavidin-coupled horseradish peroxidase occurs in linker-functionalized hydrogels compared to pure gelatin methacryloyl (- acetyl) hydrogels , and a controlled release of the streptavidin conjugate upon UV-irradiation is possible. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ( LC-MS) analysis of aqueous linker solutions allows the identification of the main cleavage products and the cleavage kinetics. Thus , it is shown that a significant hydrolysis of the linker occurs at 37 Â°C. Nevertheless the system reported here is a promising controlled release scaffold for proteins and application in tissue engineering , if background releases of the immobilized drug are tolerable.
