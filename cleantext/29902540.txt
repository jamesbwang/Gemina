  Preparations of palytoxin ( PLTX , derived from Japanese Palythoa tuberculosa) and the congeners 42-OH-PLTX ( from Hawaiian P. toxica) and ovatoxin-a ( isolated from a Japanese strain of Ostreopsis ovata) , as well as a 50:50 mixture of PLTX and 42-OH-PLTX derived from Hawaiian P. tuberculosa were characterized as to their concentration , composition , in-vitro potency and interaction with an anti-PLTX monoclonal antibody ( mAb) , after which they were evaluated for lethality and tissue histopathology after intraperitoneal ( IP) and aerosol administration to rats. Once each preparation was characterized as to its toxin composition by LC-HRMS and normalized to a total PLTX/OVTX concentration using HPLC-UV , all four preparations showed similar potency towards mouse erythrocytes in the erythrocyte hemolysis<symptom> assay and interactions with the anti-PLTX mAb.
