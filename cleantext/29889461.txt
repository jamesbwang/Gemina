  Psychosocial condition and life quality of epileptic patients are greatly determined by the existence of the disease-related comorbid disorders , like depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , and the subjective disease perception , as well as the neuropsychological consequences of the seizures.It has been examined in patients living with epilepsy how subjective disease perception and coping strategies influence life quality , comorbid depression<symptom> and the condition of anxiety<symptom>. Study patients were asked to fill in a self-completion questionnaire , which examined their psychosocial condition ( HADS , Beck Depression<symptom> Scale) , life quality ( Qolie-31) , coping strategies ( FKV-LIS) , and subjective disease perception ( IPQ-R) , as well as sociodemographic and disease variables. The subjects of the study: the data of epileptic patients between the age of 18 to 70 was recorded. Patients were selected from the adult outpatients of a national centre , a regional hospital and two private health care centres located in Budapest. Based on the multiple regression analysis. Beck 's depression<symptom> ( b coefficient = -0.351 , t = -4.703 , p < 0.001 **). Depressive coping strategy ( FKV Dep) ( b coefficient = -0.235 , t = -3.123 , p = 0.002 **). Subjective health perception ( b coefficient = 0.232. t = 3.643 , p < 0.001 **). Sex ( women; b coefficient = -0.162 , t = -3.008 , p = 0.003 **). IPQ consequences ( b coefficient = -0.161 , t = -2.572 , p = 0.012 *). Active coping strategy ( FKV Act; b coefficient = 0.146 , t = 2.572 , p = 0.012 *). Type of seizure<symptom> ( b coefficient = -0.138 , t = -2.527 , p = 0.013 *) , and Sleep quality ( b coefficient = -0.125 , t = -1.995 , p = 0.049) explain some 75.6 % of the variance of life quality 's total score ( model3: F = 33.333 , p < 0.001 **. adjusted R2 = 0.733). Among the factors of the subjective disease perception ( IPQ-R) , the physical , mental and social consequences play the most important role. Similarly , the impact of negative emotional representation , as well as the erratic nature of the seizures<symptom> are decisive. Emotional representation , cyclicity and disease coherence have an important role in coping with disease-related negative emotions.
