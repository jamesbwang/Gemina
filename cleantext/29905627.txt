  Improving healthcare safety is a worthwhile and important endeavor. Simulation-based activities can help with such a goal through research and training. In this manner , it can focus on education and training , assessment and metrics , process improvement , and culture change to help move forward both patient safety and quality of care.This article will address the following three main topics: ( 1) designing simulation-based activities to promote high reliability in healthcare , ( 2) developing simulation-based activities to foster resilience in healthcare systems , and ( 3) evaluating the impact of adverse events in healthcare and how simulation-based activities can be used to determine and potentially to prevent their cause. These topics will be treated sequentially , providing synopses of concepts and giving examples of research currently being undertaken. It will then highlight current priorities for simulation-based research in this domain by drawing from insights obtained and a targeted literature review.
