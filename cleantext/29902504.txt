  During mobile phone conversations , the temporal lobe neural networks involved in processing auditory information are exposed to electromagnetic fields ( EMF) such as pulse-modulated GSM-1800 MHz radiofrequencies that convey wireless communications. The effects of these EMF on the brain affected by a pathological condition remain little investigated. In this study , rats injected with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) to induce neuroinflammation were exposed `` head-only '' to GSM-1800 MHz signals for two hours at a specific absorption rate ( SAR) that reached an average value of 1.55 W/kg in the auditory cortex ( ACx). Immunodetection of Iba1 , a microglial marker , and electrophysiological recordings in the ACx three to six hours after global system for communication ( GSM) exposure , or sham-exposure , showed that exposure to GSM-1800 MHz resulted in a growth of microglial processes and a reduction in spontaneous firing rate. More importantly , there was a significant reduction in evoked responses to artificial and natural stimuli and an increase in response duration. The response latency and the bandwidth of the frequency tuning were unchanged , but the GSM exposure led to a higher proportion of cortical sites exhibiting abnormally high acoustic thresholds. These modifications were not observed in rats exposed to GSM-1800 MHz without pretreatment with LPS. Together our data provide evidence that in neuroinflammatory conditions , acute exposure to GSM-1800 MHz can significantly affect microglia and neuronal activity underling auditory perception.
