  In the growing list of 2D semiconductors as potential successors to silicon in future devices , metal-halide perovskites have recently joined the family. Unlike other conversional 2D covalent semiconductors such as graphene , transition metal dichalcogenides , black phosphorus , etc. , 2D perovskites are ionic materials , affording many distinct properties of their own , including high photoluminescence quantum efficiency , balanced large exciton binding energy and oscillator strength , and long carrier diffusion length. These unique properties make 2D perovskites potential candidates for optoelectronic and photonic devices such as solar cells , light-emitting diodes , photodetectors , nanolasers , waveguides , modulators , and so on , which represent a relatively new but exciting and rapidly expanding area of research. In this Review , the recent advances in emerging 2D metal-halide perovskites and their applications in the fields of optoelectronics and photonics are summarized and insights into the future direction of these fields are offered.
