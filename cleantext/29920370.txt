  Surface acylation of microcrystalline cellulose ( MCC) was performed using rice bran oil ( RBO). The resultant acylated MCC ( RAMCC) exhibited reduced polarity as compared with MCC. Attenuated Total Reflection ( ATR)- Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed hydrophobic MCC modification. RAMCC and MCC were incorporated into PLA matrix and their influence on morphological , mechanical , thermal and barrier properties of the PLA based biocomposite were analyzed. PLA/RAMCC biocomposite ( with 2 wt % loading) exhibited lower water sorption compared to PLA film and PLA/MCC. X-ray Diffraction ( XRD) analysis result showed an increase in crystallinity of PLA/RAMCC and reduction in water vapour permeability as compared to PLA film and PLA/MCC composite. PLA/RAMCC exhibited the best mechanical , thermal and UV barrier properties. The fractured surfaces of the composites showed an even distribution of RAMCC throughout PLA matrix. Biodegradability of samples was characterized using soil buried method. The cytotoxicity of the developed PLA-based films was evaluated on human dermal fibroblast ( HDF) monolayer culture by the MTT method and it has shown that the films were non-cytotoxic thus indicating their biocompatibility and non-toxicity. These biodegradable composite films can be a sustainable utilization of RBO and MCC in the packaging application.
