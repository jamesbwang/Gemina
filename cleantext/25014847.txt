  To determine the choroidal thickness ( CT) profile in keratoconus ( KC) patients using swept-source optical coherence tomography ( SS-OCT). This was a prospective , cross-sectional study. One hundred two eyes of 52 KC patients were studied using Pentacam and SS-OCT. The macular CT profile was created by manually measuring the distance between the retinal pigment epithelium and the choroid-sclera junction on horizontal b-scans at nine different macular locations. The results were compared to 93 eyes of 93 healthy controls. Mean age of the KC group was 34.9 ± 13.5 years and mean axial length ( AL) was 24.1 ± 1.3 mm. Mean topographic KC classification ( TKC) was 2.0; 39 eyes were classified as early KC ( TKC < 1-2) , 34 eyes as moderate ( TKC 2 , 2-3) , and 29 as advanced ( TKC 3 +). Mean subfoveal CT was 383.2 μm in KC patients and 280.5 μm in control group ( CT in KC patients is statistically thicker than in healthy population. After age 45 , CT decreases approaching control group values. This study describes changes in the CT profile of KC patients , a disease that was considered purely corneal. These choroidal changes argue that KC is a disease that likely involves several ocular structures other than the cornea , and could open new research lines related to the pathophysiology of KC.
