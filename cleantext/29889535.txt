  Macroscopic single-wall carbon nanotube ( SWCNT) films of nanoscale thickness have significant potential for an array of applications that demand thin , transparent , conductive coatings. Using macroscopic micrometer thick polystyrene sheets as a reference , we characterize the elastic response of freestanding multifunctional SWCNT nanosheets possessing both exceptionally high Young 's modulus and good durability. Thin SWCNT films ( 20-200 nm thick) asymmetrically `` doped '' with dilute concentrations of superparamagnetic colloids were suspended in ethanol as freestanding nanosheets. Through repeated and controlled deformation in an external magnetic field , we measure the temporal relaxation of nanosheet curvature back to equilibrium. From the relaxation time and its dependence on nanosheet thickness and length , we extract the SWCNT nanosheet modulus through a simple viscoelastic model. Our results are consistent with nearly ideal SWCNT rigidity percolation with moduli approaching 200 GPa and limited plasticity for sufficiently thick sheets , which we attribute to the screening of van der Waals interactions by the surrounding solvent and the macroscopic nature of the deformation.
