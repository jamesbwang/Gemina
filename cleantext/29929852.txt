  The validation in an interlaboratory study of the International Standards Organization standard method for the enumeration of Campylobacter<pathogen> in foods ( ISO 10272-2) was performed after preparation of the revised Standard based on scientifically sound and validated methods of analysis. The matrices selected for testing in the collaborative trial were frozen spinach , minced meat , raw milk , chicken skin , and broiler caecal material. Each matrix was artificially inoculated with a different Campylobacter<pathogen> strain. Fifteen laboratories participated in the interlaboratory study. As a general indication of repeatability limit ( r) , the following overall values can be used when testing chicken skin samples: As a general indication of reproducibility limit ( R) , the following overall values can be used when testing chicken skin samples: The validation data for all matrices were incorporated in the newly published ISO standard EN ISO 10272-2:2017- Microbiology of the food chain- Horizontal method for detection and enumeration of Campylobacter<pathogen>- Part 2: colony-count technique.
