  Analysis of secretomes critically underpins the capacity to understand the mechanisms determining interactions between cells and between cells and their environment. In the context of cancer cell micro-environments , the relevant interactions are recognised to be an important determinant of tumor progression. Global proteomic analyses of secretomes are often performed at a single time point and frequently identify both classical secreted proteins ( possessing an N-terminal signal sequence) , as well as many intracellular proteins , the release of which is of uncertain biological significance. Here , we describe a mass spectrometry-based method for stable isotope dynamic labeling of secretomes ( SIDLS) that , by dynamic SILAC , discriminates the secretion kinetics of classical secretory proteins and intracellular proteins released from cancer and stromal cells in culture. SIDLS is a robust classifier of the different cellular origins of proteins within the secretome and should be broadly applicable to non-proliferating cells and cells grown in short term culture.
