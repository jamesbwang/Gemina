  Although previous reports suggest sex-specific differences in the antidepressant actions of ( R , S)- ketamine , these differences in the antidepressant actions of ( R)- ketamine , which is more potent than ( S)- ketamine , are unknown. Saline or ( R)- ketamine was administered 23 hours post lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) administration to adult male or female mice. Subsequently , antidepressant effects were assessed using a forced swimming test ( FST). Furthermore , the concentration of ( R)- ketamine and its two major metabolites , ( R)- norketamine and ( 2R ,6 R)- hydroxynorketamine ( HNK) , was measured in the plasma and brain after the administration of ( R)- ketamine in the mice. ( R)- ketamine ( 10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the increased immobility time of FST in the LPS-treated mice. There were no sex-specific differences in the concentrations of ( R)- ketamine and its two metabolites in the plasma and brain. These findings showed no sex-specific differences in terms of the acute antidepressant effects and pharmacokinetic profile of ( R)- ketamine.
