  In bronchiectasis , exacerbations are believed to be triggered by infectious<disease> agents<disease> , but often no pathogen can be identified. We hypothesised that acute air pollution exposure may be associated with bronchiectasis exacerbations.We combined a case-crossover design with distributed lag models in an observational record linkage study. Patients were recruited from a specialist bronchiectasis clinic at Ninewells Hospital , Dundee , UK.We recruited 432 patients with clinically confirmed bronchiectasis , as diagnosed by high-resolution computed tomography. After excluding days with missing air pollution data , the final model for particles with a 50 % cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 Âµm ( PM
