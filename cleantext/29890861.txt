  A novel dimeric flavonol glycoside , Cynanflavoside A ( 1) , together with six analogues , kaempferol-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl- ( 1 → 2)- β-D-glucopyranoside ( 2) , quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl- ( 1 → 2)- β-D-glucopyranoside ( 3) , kaempferol-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl- ( 1 → 2)- β-D-xylopyranoside ( 4) , quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl- ( 1 → 2)- β-D-xylopyranoside ( 5) , kaempferol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-7-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside ( 6) , and quercetin-3-O-galactoside ( 7) were isolated from the n-butyl alcohol extract of Cynanchum acutum subsp. sibiricum. Their structures were determined spectroscopically and compared with previously reported spectral data. All compounds were evaluated for their anti-complementary activity in vitro , and only compound 5 exhibited anti-complement effects with CH
