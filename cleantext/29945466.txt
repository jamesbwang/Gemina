  Prior to the sequencing of the human genome , it was presumed that most of the DNA coded for proteins. However , with the advent of next-generation sequencing , it has now been recognized that most complex eukaryotic genomes are in fact transcribed into noncoding RNAs ( ncRNAs) , including a family of transcripts referred to as long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs). LncRNAs have been implicated in many biological processes ranging from housekeeping functions such as transcription to more specialized functions such as dosage compensation or genomic imprinting , among others. Interestingly , lncRNAs are not limited to a defined set of functions but can regulate varied activities such as messenger RNA degradation , translation , and protein kinetics or function as RNA decoys or scaffolds. Although still in its infancy , research into the biology of lncRNAs has demonstrated the importance of lncRNAs in development and disease. However , the specific mechanisms through which these lncRNAs act remain poorly defined. Focused research into a small number of these lncRNAs has provided important clues into the heterogeneous nature of this family of ncRNAs. Due to the complex diversity of lncRNA function , in this review , we provide an update on the platforms available for investigators to aid in the identification of lncRNA function.
