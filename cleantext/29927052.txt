  Classifying indolent prostate cancer represents a significant clinical challenge. We investigated whether integrating data from different omic platforms could identify a biomarker panel with improved performance compared to individual platforms alone. DNA methylation , transcripts , protein , and glycosylation biomarkers were assessed in a single cohort of patients treated by radical prostatectomy. Novel multi-block statistical data integration approaches were used to deal with missing data and modelled via stepwise multinomial logistic regression , or LASSO. After applying leave-one-out cross-validation to each model , the probabilistic predictions of disease type for each individual panel were aggregated to improve prediction accuracy by using all available information for a given patient. Through assessment of three performance parameters of area under the curve ( AUC) values , calibration , and decision curve analysis , the study identified an integrated biomarker panel which predicts disease type with a high-level of accuracy , with Multi AUC value of 0.91 ( 0.89,0.94) and ordinal C-index ( ORC) value of 0.94 ( 0.91,0.96) which was significantly improved compared to the values for the clinical panel alone of 0.67 ( 0.62,0.72) Multi AUC and 0.72 ( 0.67,0.78) ORC. Biomarker integration across different omic platforms significantly improves prediction accuracy. We provide a novel multi-platform approach for the analysis , determination , and performance assessment of novel panels which can be applied to other diseases. With further refinement and validation , this panel could form a tool to help inform appropriate treatment strategies impacting on patient outcome in early stage prostate cancer.
