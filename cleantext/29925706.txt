  Regeneration of tissue , including bone , using mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) has been progressing rapidly. Regeneration of bone requires the presence of an appropriate environment and efficient chemotaxis of cells to the target site. Differentiation of MSCs into mesenchymal cells has received considerable attention , but the effect of MSCs on chemotaxis is not well understood. In this study , we investigated the effect of MSCs on chemotaxis of RAW264 cells via C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 ( CCL2). Balb/c mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs and RAW264 cells , which are osteoclast precursor cells , were co-cultured without cell contact. The gene expression of CCL2 in MSCs and CC-chemokine receptor 2 ( CCR2) in RAW264 cells was determined using quantitative real-time PCR. Analysis of RAW264 cell chemotaxis was performed using the Boyden chamber assay. mRNAs for CCL2 and CCR2 were significantly upregulated upon co-culture in comparison to culture of either cell type alone , and the number of chemotactic RAW264 cells was significantly increased by co-culture. MSCs enhanced the chemotaxis of RAW264 cells , possibly via CCL2-CCR2 interaction , suggesting the potential utility of MSCs for tissue regeneration.
