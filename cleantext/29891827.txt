  The growing interest in mobile devices is transforming wireless identification technologies. Mobile and battery-powered Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID) readers , such as hand readers and smart phones , are are becoming increasingly attractive. These RFID readers require energy-efficient anti-collision protocols to minimize the tag collisions and to expand the reader 's battery life. Furthermore , there is an increasing interest in RFID sensor networks with a growing number of RFID sensor tags. Thus , RFID application developers must be mindful of tag anti-collision protocols. Energy-efficient protocols involve a low reader energy consumption per tag. This work presents a thorough study of the reader energy consumption per tag and analyzes the main factor that affects this metric: the frame size update strategy. Using the conclusion of this analysis , the anti-collision protocol Energy-Aware Slotted Aloha ( EASA) is presented to decrease the energy consumption per tag. The frame size update strategy of EASA is configured to minimize the energy consumption per tag. As a result , EASA presents an energy-aware frame. The performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated and compared with several state of the art Aloha-based anti-collision protocols based on the current RFID standard. Simulation results show that EASA , with an average of 15 mJ consumed per tag identified , achieves a 6 % average improvement in the energy consumption per tag in relation to the strategies of the comparison.
