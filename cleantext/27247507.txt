  Citrate is an old metabolite which is best known for the role in the Krebs cycle. Citrate is widely used in many branches of medicine. In ophthalmology citrate is considered as a therapeutic agent and an useful diagnostic tool-biomarker. To summarize the published literature on citrate usage in the leading causes of blindness<symptom> and highlight the new possibilities for this old metabolite. We conducted a systematic search of the scientific literature about citrate usage in ophthalmology up to January 2018. The reference lists of identified articles were searched for providing in-depth information. This systematic review included 30 articles. The role of citrate in the leading causes of blindness<symptom> is presented. Citrate might help inhibit cataract progression , in case of questions confirm glaucoma diagnosis or improve cornea repair treatment as adjuvant agent ( therapy of ulcerating cornea after alkali injury , crosslinking procedure). However , the knowledge about possible citrate usage in ophthalmology is not widely known. Promoting recent scientific knowledge about citrate usage in ophthalmology may not only benefit of medical improvement but may also limit economic costs caused by leading causes of blindness<symptom>. Further studies on citrate usage in ophthalmology should continuously be the field of scientific interest.
