  Protein folding and receptor-ligand recognition are fundamental processes for any living organism. Although folding and ligand recognition are based on the same chemistry , the existing empirical scoring functions target just one problem: predicting the correct fold or the correct binding pose. We here introduce a statistical potential which considers moieties as fundamental units. The scoring function is able to deal with both folding and ligand pocket recognition problems with a performance comparable to the scoring functions specifically tailored for one of the two tasks. We foresee that the capability of the new scoring function to tackle both problems in a unified framework will be a key to deal with the induced fit phenomena , in which a target protein changes significantly its conformation upon binding. Moreover , the new scoring function might be useful in docking protocols towards intrinsically disordered proteins , whose flexibility can not be handled with the available docking software.
