  Ischemia-reperfusion injury ( IRI) is a severe problem patients diagnosed with acute limb ischemia. Recently , microRNAs ( miR) have emerged as regulators of IRI as well as ischemic preconditioning and ischemic postconditioning. Therefore , using rat models , this study aims to explore all of the possible mechanisms that miR-19 exhibits with its relation to the transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-β1)/ Smad signaling pathway in the lower limb IRI. An immunofluorescence staining method was used to identify the Krueppel-like factor 10 ( KLF10) positive expression and the location of KLF10 expression. The targeting relationship that miR-19 has with KLF10 was verified by the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Vascular endothelial cells ( VECs) were treated with elevated or suppressed miR-19 or KLF10 knockdown. A 3- ( 4 , 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2 , 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was used to test cell proliferation , and flow cytometry was employed to detect both cell cycle and apoptosis. The KLF10-positive expression in the VECs ( both in cytoplasm and nucleus) was found to be elevated in the IRI rats. We found that miR-19 was downregulated , KLF10 upregulated , and the TGF-β1/ Smad signaling pathway activated in the vascular epithelial tissues of IRI rats. KLF10 is a target gene of miR-19. Overexpression of miR-19 decreased the expression of KLF10 , TGF-β1 , and Smad2/3. Decreased miR-19 inhibited VEC proliferation , arrested VECs at the G1 phase , and promoted the apoptosis of VECs following their lower limb I/R injury. These results indicate miR-19 as being an inhibitor in the VEC injury of IRI via the TGF-β1/ Smad signaling pathway by suppression of KLF10.
