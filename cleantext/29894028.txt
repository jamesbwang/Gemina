  As patients with diabetes continue to have greater problems with obesity , the need for more medications and higher doses of insulin has increased. Some patients are so insulin resistant that they require U-500 insulin. All insulins carry the risk of hypoglycemia. Despite being the most potent insulin available , the methodology for describing U-500 insulin administration varies. This paper examines the properties of U-500 insulin and suggests a unified method of defining how it is administered. A literature search for English language articles that reference U-500 insulin was performed. The 51 articles , and additional websites as applicable , were independently reviewed. Now that U-500 insulin has a specific syringe and a pen , all patients who use this should be converted to one of these two devices. The insulin dose should be described as the number of units administered. U-500 insulin is a potent formulation and carries the risk of hypoglycemia. A unified method of administration is now available , and the description of its use should reflect the number of units administered.
