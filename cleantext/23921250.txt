  Recent hypotheses have posited that orbital frontal cortex ( OFC) is important for using inferred consequences to guide behavior. Less clear is OFC 's contribution to goal-directed or model-based behavior , where the decision to act is controlled by previous experience with the consequence or outcome. Investigating OFC 's role in learning about changed outcomes separate from decision-making is not trivial and often the two are confounded. Here we adapted an incentive learning task to mice , where we investigated processes controlling experience-based outcome updating independent from inferred action control. We found chemogenetic OFC attenuation did not alter the ability to perceive motivational state-induced changes in outcome value but did prevent the experience-based updating of this change. Optogenetic inhibition of OFC excitatory neuron activity selectively when experiencing an outcome change disrupted the ability to update , leaving mice unable to infer the appropriate behavior. Our findings support a role for OFC in learning that controls decision-making.
