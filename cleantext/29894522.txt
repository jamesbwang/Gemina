  Treatment of digital skin cancers is challenging due to various functional and cosmetic implications. Traditionally , routine treatment includes radical amputation , but digital skin cancers are increasingly being treated with more conservative , tissue-sparing methods such as Mohs micrographic surgery ( MMS) , which provides excellent tissue conservation and margin control when used to treat melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers ( NMSCs). In this study , we conducted a retrospective chart review to evaluate clinical outcomes following MMS for treatment of digital melanoma and NMSCs.
