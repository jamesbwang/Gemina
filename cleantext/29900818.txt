  The Moses technology of the holmium laser has been shown to decrease retropulsion in the ureter and procedural time in kidney stones during laser lithotripsy. Theoretically , these improvements could lead to cost savings for the patient. All patients with total laser energy data recorded who underwent ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy by a single surgeon at a tertiary care center were included. Total lasing time was calculated from the total laser energy. Sub-analyses were done on stone size and stone composition. The procedure time using Moses technology was projected to be approximately 35 % less than procedure time without the Moses technology based on prior in vitro studies. The projected cost savings was then utilized to predict cost-effectiveness of the Moses technology. Forty patients underwent ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy. Mean stones size was 10.2 mm and mean lasing time was 3.02 minutes. Linear regression showed a positive association between stone size and laser time , p = 0.01. There was no significant correlation between stone composition or stone Hounsfield units and lasing time. On cost analyses , for stones of all sizes the Moses system has a price differential of an increase in $ 292.36 when compared to the standard Holmium TracTip system. Specifically for stones larger than 10 mm , the price differential is an increase in $ 253.16 for the Moses technology. The decrease in lasing time achieved by the Moses system does not translate into sufficient cost savings to off-set the higher cost of the laser fiber and software.
