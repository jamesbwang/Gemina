  To characterize a population of pediatric patients visiting an infusion center for acute migraine and determine predictors of first-line treatment success in this population. Though migraine is common in the pediatric emergency department and specialized infusion centers , little is known about this patient population and whether or not clinical data can be used to predict treatment response. This was an observational study involving a retrospective analysis of data from visits to the Cincinnati Children 's Hospital infusion center for treatment of an acute migraine. Data were extracted from a database and chart reviews were completed for missing or outlying data. Descriptive statistics were used to outline patient: sex , age , race , primary ICHD-III diagnosis , chronic migraine , medication overuse headache<symptom> ( MOH) , headache<symptom> frequency , month of treatment , headache<symptom> severity , headache<symptom> duration , use of acute medication at home in the past 24 hours and treatment received ( metoclopramide vs prochlorperazine and dexamethasone vs no dexamethasone). The odds of success of first-line intervention were modeled using simple logistic regression with the above characteristics used as predictors. Predictors with a P value < .05 in the multiple logistic regression model with progressive backwards selection were entered into a final multiple logistic regression model controlling for age , sex and diagnosis , where a P value < .05 was considered statistically significant. Data from 837 visits ( n = 837) were included in this analysis. Visits were significantly more frequent in the academic year as compared to the summer ( Z = 10.716 , P < .0001). In the multiple logistic regression model , the odds of first-line treatment success decreased as headache<symptom> frequency increased ( OR = 0.951 , 95 % CI = 0.934-0.969 , P < .0001) , were higher for patients without MOH ( OR = 1.528 , 95 % CI = 1.097-3.714 , P = .0469) , and were higher for patients who did not receive dexamethasone ( OR = 1.528 , 95 % CI = 1.097-3.714 , P = .0469). Higher baseline headache<symptom> frequency and presence of MOH may predict lower odds of treatment success after first-line intervention for pediatric migraine in the acute setting. These predictors may be useful in stratifying patients for treatment protocols and for planning future intervention studies.
