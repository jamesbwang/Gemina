  Some diatoms are able to colonize as epibionts on their potential zooplankton predators. Here , we report Pseudohimantidium pacificum living on the copepod Corycaeus giesbrechti and as a new finding on Oithona nana<pathogen> , Protoraphis atlantica living on the copepod Pontellopsis brevis , Protoraphis hustedtiana on the cypris larvae of barnacles , and Falcula hyalina on the copepod Acartia lilljeborgii. The epizoic diatoms were able to grow as free-living forms under culture conditions. Pseudohimantidium pacificum and P. atlantica appeared as the most derived species from their benthic diatom ancestors. The mucilage pad or stalk of the strains of these species showed important morphological distinction when compared with their epizoic forms. Barnacle larvae explore benthic habitats before settlement , and epibiosis on them is an example where P. hustedtiana profits from the host behavior for dispersal of its benthic populations. Molecular phylogenies based on the SSU rRNA and RuBisCO large subunit ( rbcL) gene sequences revealed F. hyalina as an independent lineage within the Fragilariales ( Tabularia , Catacombas , and others) , consistent with its morphological distinction in the low number of rows ( â‰¤ 6) in the ocellulimbus , among other features. We propose the transfer of F. hyalina to the genus Pseudofalcula gen. nov.. Molecular phylogeny suggests a single order for the members of the Cyclophorales and the Protoraphidales , and that the epibioses of araphid diatoms on marine zooplankton have been independently acquired several times. These clades are constituted of both epizoic and epiphytic/epilithic forms that evidence a recent acquisition of the epizoic modus vivendi.
