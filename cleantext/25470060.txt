  The La and the La-related protein ( LARP) superfamily is a diverse class of RNA binding proteins involved in RNA processing , folding , and function. Larp7 binds to the abundant long noncoding 7SK RNA and is required for 7SK ribonucleoprotein ( RNP) assembly and function. The 7SK RNP sequesters a pool of the positive transcription elongation factor b ( P-TEFb) in an inactive state; on release , P-TEFb phosphorylates RNA Polymerase II to stimulate transcription elongation. Despite its essential role in transcription , limited structural information is available for the 7SK RNP , particularly for protein-RNA interactions. Larp7 contains an N-terminal La module that binds UUU-3 ` OH and a C-terminal atypical RNA recognition motif ( xRRM) required for specific binding to 7SK and P-TEFb assembly. Deletion of the xRRM is linked to gastric cancer in humans. We report the 2.2-Ã… X-ray crystal structure of the human La-related protein group 7 ( hLarp7) xRRM bound to the 7SK stem-loop 4 , revealing a unique binding interface. Contributions of observed interactions to binding affinity were investigated by mutagenesis and isothermal titration calorimetry. NMR
