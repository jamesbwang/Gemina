  An animal 's phenotype may be shaped by its genes , but also reflects its own environment and often that of its parents. Nongenetic parental effects are often mediated by steroid hormones , and operate between parents and offspring through mechanisms that are well described in vertebrate and model systems. However , less is understood about the strength and frequency of hormone mediated nongenetic parental effects across more than one generation of descendants , and in nonmodel systems. Here we show that the concentration of active ecdysteroid hormones provided by a female house cricket ( Acheta domesticus) affects the growth rate of her offspring. We also reveal that variation in the active ecdysteroid hormones provided by a female house cricket to her eggs derives primarily from the quality of nutrition available to her maternal grandmother , regardless of genetic background. This finding is in stark contrast to most previous work that documents a decline in the strength of environmentally based parental effects with each passing generation. Strong grandparental effects may be adaptive under predictable , cyclical changes in the environment. Our results also suggest that hormone-mediated grand-maternal effects represent an important potential mechanism by which organisms can respond to environmental variability , and that further study of hormone-mediated carryover effects in this context could be profitable.
