  Labeled gangliosides are invaluable tools to study their transport and metabolism within cells as well as to determine their distribution in membranes<symptom> , and their interaction with membrane lipids and proteins. Here I describe established procedures to synthesize ganglioside derivatives with a fluorescent tag either attached to its sialooligosaccharide or ceramide portion. These procedures are chosen as to minimize the integrity of the ganglioside molecule and hence , to leave their native skeleton formally intact. The Î±-position of the stearic acid residue is favorable for the attachment both of hydrophilic and of lipophilic dyes. In some other cases , and starting from lyso-gangliosides , procedures are described by which a fluorescent tag bound to a short acyl chain replaces the native acyl chain of gangliosides.
