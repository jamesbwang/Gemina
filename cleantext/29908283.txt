  MicroRNA ( miRNA) is a sort of endogenous ~ 20-25 nt non-coding RNAs , and it can regulate a variety of biological events. We found the miR-378 may involve in regulating the muscle development of sheep during our previous research. However , the molecular mechanism of miR-378 regulating myoblast proliferation is still unclear. In this research , we predicted that BMP2 ( Bone morphogenetic protein 2) was the target gene of miR-378 and the BMP-Smad signal pathway that BMP2 participated in playing an important role in the muscle development. Therefore , we tried to determine whether miR-378 influence myoblast proliferation of sheep through the BMP-Smad signal pathway. The results indicated that inhibit BMP-Smad signal pathway by interfering Smad4 to promote proliferation of sheep myoblasts; promote BMP-Smad signal pathway by interfering Smad7 to inhibit proliferation of sheep myoblasts; over-expression miR-378 promotes BMP-Smad signal pathway and myoblast proliferation in sheep; interfering miR-378 inhibits BMP-Smad signal pathway and myoblast proliferation in sheep. However , when both of which functioned at the myoblast , miR-378 could not fully depend on BMP-Smad signal pathway to regulate myoblast proliferation. In sum , both miR-378 and BMP-Smad can influence the proliferation of myoblast , but miR-378 does not target the 3 ' UTR of sheep BMP2.
