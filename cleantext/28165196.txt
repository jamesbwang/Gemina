  It is still a grand challenge to develop a highly efficient nonprecious-metal electrocatalyst to replace the Pt-based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR). Here , we propose a surfactant-assisted method to synthesize single-atom iron catalysts ( SA-Fe/NG). The half-wave potential of SA-Fe/NG is only 30 mV less than 20 % Pt/C in acidic medium , while it is 30 mV superior to 20 % Pt/C in alkaline medium. Moreover , SA-Fe/NG shows extremely high stability with only 12 mV and 15 mV negative shifts after 5,000 cycles in acidic and alkaline media , respectively. Impressively , the SA-Fe/NG-based acidic proton exchange membrane fuel cell ( PEMFC) exhibits a high power density of 823 mW cm
