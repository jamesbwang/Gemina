  The unique effects of gastric resection after vertical sleeve gastrectomy ( VSG) on type 2 diabetes mellitus remain unclear. This work aimed to investigate the effects of VSG on gastric leptin expression and intestinal glucose absorption in high-fat diet-induced obesity. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet ( HFD) to induce obesity. HFD mice were randomized into VSG and sham-operation groups , and the relevant parameters were measured at 8 weeks postoperation. Higher gastric leptin expression and increased intestinal glucose transport were observed in the HFD mice. Furthermore , VSG reduced gastric leptin expression and the intestinal absorption of alimentary glucose. Both exogenous leptin replenishment during the oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT) and the addition of leptin into the everted isolated jejunum<symptom> loops in vitro restored the glucose transport capacity in VSG-operated mice , and this effect was abolished when the glucose transporter GLUT2 was blocked with phloretin. Moreover , phloretin almost completely suppressed glucose transport in the HFD mice. Intestinal immunohistochemistry in the obese mice showed increased GLUT2 and diminished sodium glucose co-transporter 1 ( SGLT-1) in the apical membrane of enterocytes. Decreased GLUT2 and enhanced SGLT1 were observed following VSG. VSG also reduced the phosphorylation status of protein kinase C isoenzyme β II ( PKCβ II) in the jejunum<symptom> , which was stimulated by the combination of leptin and glucose. Our data demonstrated that the decreased secretion of gastric leptin in VSG results in a decrease in intestinal glucose absorption via modulation of GLUT2 translocation.
