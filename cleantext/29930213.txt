  We describe an adult case of radiation-induced meningioma ( RIM) that was identified within a short interval from the initial treatment for brain tumor. A 45-year-old woman , who had tumor resection followed by radiation therapy for right frontal oligodendroglioma , showed a small enhanced lesion<symptom> on the right frontal region 3 years and 6 months after the initial radiation therapy. The pathological diagnosis was meningioma ( World Health Organization ( WHO) grade I) and the Ki-67 labeling index was 3.2 %. Most RIMs occur after a long period of time ( 18.7-24.0 years on average) following radiation therapy. Several studies have suggested that the period before the occurrence of RIM is correlated with both the age of a patient and the radiation dose at the time of radiation therapy. A patient that receives a higher dose of radiation at a younger age has a higher risk of RIM occurrence. In this case , the patient was middle aged; however , she was exposed to a high dose of radiation ( 54 Gy). High-dose radiation might induce the early onset of RIM. Recently , treatments for glioma have been developed , thus resulting in an increased long-term survival rate among patients. Physicians must pay attention not only to the recurrence of gliomas but also to the occurrence of RIMs.
