  Identifying molecules that are differentially expressed in encephalitogenic T cells is critical to the development of novel and specific therapies for multiple sclerosis ( MS). In this study , IL-3 was identified as a molecule highly expressed in encephalitogenic Th1 and Th17 cells , but not in myelin-specific non-encephalitogenic Th1 and Th17 cells. However , B10.PL IL-3-deficient mice remained susceptible to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis<disease> ( EAE) , a mouse model of MS. Furthermore , B10.PL myelin-specific T cell receptor transgenic IL-3
