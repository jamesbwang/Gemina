  To evaluate the blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) effects of a yearlong e-health solution designed to interrupt prolonged occupational sitting time. BP data of 228 desk-based employees ( 45.1 ± 10.5 years) were analyzed at baseline , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months. Systolic BP significantly reduced from baseline for the first 9 months ( 1.0 to 3.4 mmHg; P < 0.01) while diastolic and mean arterial pressure decreased for the full 12-months ( 4 to 5 mmHg for diastolic pressure and 3.6 to 4.2 mmHg for MAP; all P < 0.01). Participants used the e-health solution 5.5 ± 2.0 times/day in the first 3 months which reduced to 4.2 ± 2.5 times/day by the end of the study ( P < 0.05). An e-health solution designed to increase non-exercise physical activity by interrupting sitting time in the workplace is feasible and produced long-term reductions in
