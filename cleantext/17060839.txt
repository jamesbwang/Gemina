  The prevalence of mobile phone use across the world has increased greatly over the past two decades. Problematic Mobile Phone Use ( PMPU) has been studied in relation to public health and comprises various behaviours , including dangerous , prohibited , and dependent use. These types of problematic mobile phone behaviours are typically assessed with the short version of the Problematic Mobile Phone Use Questionnaire ( PMPUQ ⁻ SV). However , to date , no study has ever examined the degree to which the PMPU scale assesses the same construct across different languages. The aims of the present study were to ( i) determine an optimal factor structure for the PMPUQ ⁻ SV among university populations using eight versions of the scale ( i.e. , French , German , Hungarian , English , Finnish , Italian , Polish , and Spanish); and ( ii) simultaneously examine the measurement invariance ( MI) of the PMPUQ ⁻ SV across all languages. The whole study sample comprised 3038 participants. Descriptive statistics , correlations , and Cronbach 's alpha coefficients were extracted from the demographic and PMPUQ-SV items. Individual and multigroup confirmatory factor analyses alongside MI analyses were conducted. Results showed a similar pattern of PMPU across the translated scales. A three-factor model of the PMPUQ-SV fitted the data well and presented with good psychometric properties. Six languages were validated independently , and five were compared via measurement invariance for future cross-cultural comparisons. The present paper contributes to the assessment of problematic mobile phone use because it is the first study to provide a cross-cultural psychometric analysis of the PMPUQ-SV.
