  This review provides updates in gender disparities in the symptom profile , risk factors , quality and timeliness of guideline-based medical care , and clinical outcomes , including mortality , bleeding , and vascular complications , in patients with acute myocardial infarction ( AMI). While AMI continues to be a leading cause of mortality in both men and women , significant gender differences exist in presentation , management , and outcomes. Women with AMI are older , suffer atypical symptoms , and more often present with HF and cardiogenic shock<symptom>. Delays in medical care and hence longer ischemic times exist in women , partly due to decreased awareness and lack of symptom recognition. Women continue to be less likely to receive guideline-based pharmacological therapies and revascularization than men with AMI. While women suffer from significantly higher risk-adjusted rates of bleeding , vascular complications , and short-term mortality , the risk-adjusted rates of long-term mortality remain similar between men and women. Further investigations and efforts are needed to aggressively modify risk factors , reduce delays in care , and address the higher rates of adverse events seen in women with AMI. Significant sex disparities are prevalent in presentation , management , and outcomes of adults with AMI. Further investigations and efforts are needed to aggressively modify risk factors , reduce delays in care , and address the higher rates of adverse events seen in women with AMI.
