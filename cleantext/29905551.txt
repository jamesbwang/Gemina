  This review is devoted to the urgent problem of cardiology and oncology- the cardiotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs- anthracyclines , which are considered to be one of the most cardiotoxic and cause a variety of cardiotoxic effects. The review also examines the diagnosis , treatment or preventive treatment of this pathology. The urgency of the problem is associated with the possibility of early or late manifestations of cardiotoxicity , manifestations of cardiotoxicity against the background of cross treatment , manifestations of cardiotoxicity against the background of various concomitant diseases. The review identified 9 main categories of cardiovascular complications during chemotherapeutic treatment and presents the types of cardiotoxicity caused by the use of anthracyclines. The issue of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> as a manifestation of anthracycline cardiotoxicity and the approaches to early diagnosis of cardiac insufficiency were examined in detail. The recommendations of the European Society of Medical Oncology ( ESMO) ( 2012) , the recommendations the European Society of Cardiology ( ESC) in 2016 regarding the diagnosis and treatment of these patients are reviewed. An overview of the literature on the treatment and diagnosis of this category of patients is presented , especially with concomitant diseases. Examination of the patients , the timing of the initiation of therapy , preventive treatment , medication correction of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , the doses , the combinations of chemotherapeutic drugs are issues that are recommended for the multidisciplinary team to successfully manage these patients.
