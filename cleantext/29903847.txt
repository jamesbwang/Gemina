  In the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results ( LEADER) cardiovascular ( CV) outcomes trial ( NCT01179048) , liraglutide significantly reduced the risk of CV events ( by 13 %) and hypoglycemia versus placebo. This post hoc analysis examines the associations between hypoglycemia and CV outcomes and death. Patients with type 2 diabetes and high risk for CV disease ( A total of 267 patients experienced severe hypoglycemia ( liraglutide Patients experiencing severe hypoglycemia were at greater risk of CV events and death , particularly shortly after the hypoglycemic episode. While causality remains unclear , reducing hypoglycemia remains an important goal in diabetes management.
