  Neurotropin ( NTP) is a Japanese analgesic agent for treating neuropathic pain; however , its method of action remains unclear. This study examined the effects of NTP on the activity of small dorsal root ganglion ( DRG) neurons using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. After 3 days of treatment , NTP decreased current injection-induced firing activity of cultured DRG neurons by raising the current threshold for action potential generation. Additionally , NTP increased the sustained component of voltage-gated potassium ( K
