  Neurenteric cysts<symptom> ( NC) are rare , benign , congenital lesions<symptom> , caused by abnormal or persistent communications between neuroectodermal structures , the notochord and endodermal tissue. They present mainly in the pediatric population or young adults , coexisting with spinal , gastrointestinal or respiratory malformations. They are typically intradural extramedullary tumors , with intramedullary lesions<symptom> the exception. The objective of this paper is to report the case of a cervical intramedullary neuroenteric cyst<symptom> in a young adult , without coexisting malformations. According to the literature , surgical treatment is elective though , considering the high recurrence rate , radical resection should be the surgical goal. Follow-up with magnetic resonance imaging is recommended for subtotal surgical resections.
