  Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion ( MI/R) injury is a leading factor responsible for damage in myocardial infarction , resulting in additional injury to cardiac tissues involved in oxidative stress , inflammation<symptom> , and apoptosis. Thymoquinone ( TQ) , the main constituent of Nigella sativa L. seeds , has been reported to possess various biological activities. However , few reports regarding myocardial protection are available at present. Therefore , this study was conducted aiming to investigate the protective effect of TQ against MI/R injury and to clarify its potential mechanism. MI/R injury models of isolated rat hearts and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were established. The Langendorff isolated perfused heart system , triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining , gene transfection , TransLaser scanning confocal microscopy , and western blotting were employed to evaluate the cardioprotection effect of TQ against MI/R injury. Compared with the MI/R group , TQ treatment could remarkably improve left ventricular function , decrease myocardial infarct size and production of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) , and attenuate mitochondrial oxidative damage by elevating superoxide dismutase ( SOD) activity and reducing production of hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2) and malonaldehyde ( MDA). Moreover , the cardioprotective effect of TQ was accompanied by up-regulated expression of SIRT1 and inhibition of p53 acetylation. Additionally , TQ treatment could also enhance mitochondrial function and reduce the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes. Nonetheless , the cardioprotective effect of TQ could be mitigated by SIRT1 inhibitor sirtinol and SIRT1 siRNA , respectively , which was achieved through inhibition of the SIRT1 signaling pathway. The findings in this study demonstrate that TQ is efficient in attenuating MI/R injury through activation of the SIRT1 signaling pathway , which can thus reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress damage and cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
