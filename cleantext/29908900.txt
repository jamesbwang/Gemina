  Classical studies have described in detail the complex and regionalized morphology of the Malpighian tubule ( MT) in larval Lepidoptera. Recent studies revealed unusual aspects of ion transport in the Malpighian tubules of the larva of the cabbage looper , Trichoplusia ni. These included: cation reabsorption via secondary cells ( SC); coupling of SCs to neighbouring PCs via gap junctions to enable reabsorption; and a reversal from cation secretion to reabsorption by the principal cells in the distal ileac plexus region of the in situ tubule in response to dietary ion loading. The current paper aimed to identify molecular components of ion transport in the MTs of T. ni and to describe their role in the recently reported reversal of ion transport in ion-loaded animals. Using a combination of molecular , immunohistochemical and electrophysiological techniques , we assigned roles to Na
