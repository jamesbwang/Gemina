  To assess preadolescents ' emotional reactions and intended use of refusal responses to tobacco and ecstasy. A total of 333 students from two junior schools in Baise City were recruited with cluster-sampling method , filled the questionnaire to assess a respondent 's emotional reactions and refusal skills in response to an offer of tobacco and MDMA from Feb to Jul 2014. 88. 89 % -93. 39 % of preadolescents would more likely to use `` say no `` and `` tell them you do n't want it ''. A series of 2 ( type of drug) × 2 ( offerer) × 2 ( sex) ANOVAs showed there were main effects for sex in `` explicit refusal scale '' ( F = 8. 391 , P = 0. 004) , `` excuse scale '' ( F = 156. 560 , P < 0. 001) , `` implicit refusal scale '' ( F = 84. 498 , P < 0. 001) , `` aggression scale '' ( F = 31. 911 , P < 0. 001). For the excuse scale , there were main effects for drug ( F = 12. 009 , P = 0. 001). A series of χ ~ 2-tests showed that participants were more `` curious `` to MDMA offers than tobacco offers from close friends and acquaintances ( χ ~ 2 = 13. 76 , P = 0. 0003; χ ~ 2 = 10. 24 , P = 0. 002). For the close friends offers , participants were more `` pleasure '' to tobacco offers than MDMA offers ( χ ~ 2 = 8. 33 , P = 0. 006). There were significant effects of sex and offers in refusal style for drug offers. Preadolescents would show different emotional reaction to type of drug supplier or provider.
