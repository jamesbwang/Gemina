  Closed flexor tendon rupture after a malunited distal radius fracture is rare and usually becomes apparent early after the fracture. Most cases are accompanied by a severe distal radio-ulnar joint capsule injury , wherein bone protrusion ( as a spur) directly stresses the tendons. We experienced a nonspecific flexor tendon rupture associated with an old fracture and the presence of collagen disease. A 63-year-old woman presented with delayed complete rupture of the flexor digitorum profundus ( FDP) of the fifth digit. Her history included closed fracture on the left wrist at age 13 years. At 27 years , she was diagnosed with Behçet syndrome<disease> and commenced oral prednisolone 10 mg/day. At the current admission , physical examination revealed that she was incapable of fifth finger flexion after minor passive extension. The fifth digit FDP rupture appeared to be due to damage at the wrist-level fracture site. A tiny capsule rupture was seen on the volar side of the distal radio-ulnar joint. We resected ulnar head osteophytes protruding from the capsule hole and transferred tendon from the fifth FDP to the fourth FDP. Reportedly , metalloproteases weaken tendon structure by acting as a collagenase in patients with Behçet syndrome<disease>. Also , vasculitis next to a tendon and steroid intake are considered to impede the tendon repair process. Hence , even minor trauma may lead to complete tendon rupture. Although an injury seems slight , we should take into account the possible history of bone and joint trauma.
