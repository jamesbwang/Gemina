  Local hybrid functionals , that is , functionals with local dependence on the exact exchange energy density , generalize the popular class of global hybrid functionals and extend the applicability of density functional theory to electronic structures that require an accurate description of static correlation. However , the higher computational cost compared to conventional Kohn-Sham density functional theory restrained their widespread application. Here , we present a low-prefactor , linear-scaling method to evaluate the local hybrid exchange-correlation potential as well as the corresponding nuclear forces by employing a seminumerical integration scheme. In the seminumerical scheme , one integration in the electron repulsion integrals is carried out analytically and the other one is carried out numerically , employing an integration grid. A high computational efficiency is achieved by combining the preLinK method ( J. Kussmann and C. Ochsenfeld , J. Chem. Phys. 2013 138 , 134114) with explicit screening of integrals for batches of grid points to minimize the screening overhead. This new method , denoted as preLinX , provides an 8-fold performance increase for a DNA fragment containing four base pairs as compared to existing S- and P-junction-based methods. In this way , our method allows for the evaluation of local hybrid functionals at a cost similar to that of global hybrid functionals. The linear-scaling behavior , efficiency , accuracy , and multinode parallelization of the presented method is demonstrated for large systems containing more than 1000 atoms.
