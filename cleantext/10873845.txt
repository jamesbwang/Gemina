  Terrestrial tri-trophic interactions account for a large part of biodiversity , with approximately 75 % represented in plant-insect-parasitoid interactions. Herbivore diet breadth is an important factor mediating these tri-trophic interactions , as specialisation can influence how herbivore fitness is affected by plant traits. We investigated how phytochemistry , herbivore immunity , and herbivore diet breadth mediate plant-caterpillar-parasitoid interactions on the tropical plant genus
