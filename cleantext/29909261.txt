  Growth hormone ( GH) and insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-I) exert essential functions to maintain an adequate metabolic activity for correct placental and fetal development. Although fructosamine ( FRUCT) is used in clinical evaluation to assess the glycaemic state , the relationships between GH , IGF-I and FRUCT remain unknown in the mare. Therefore , the objectives of this study were to evaluate the relationships among these parameters in pregnant mares. A total of 30 healthy Spanish Purebred mares , with an age range of 9.33 Â± 3.31 years , were studied during the 11 months of gestation. Serum concentrations of GH , IGF-I and FRUCT were analyzed by EIA , competition ELISA and spectrophotometry , respectively. GH showed a biphasic pattern , the first occurred during 4th and 5th month and the second which was higher than the 1st one during the 7th , 8th and 9th month ( P < 0.05). Compared to the 1st month , the IGF-I concentrations increased in the 2nd month ( P < 0.05) , decreased in the 3rd and 4th month and increased to reach the maximum average value in the 5th month ( P < 0.05); after slight oscillations between the 6th and 8th month , IGF-I concentrations increased in the 9th month ( P < 0.05) , decreasing until the end of gestation. FRUCT increased progressively and significantly from the 6th month of gestation , reaching the maximum values in the last month of gestation ( P < 0.05). These results suggest that alternative mechanisms other than GH and IGF-I could be involved in the regulation of glycaemic metabolism in pregnant mare.
