  The development of a nitric oxide ( NO)- generating surface with long-term , stable and controllable NO release improves the therapeutic efficacy of cardiovascular stents. In this work , we developed a `` one-pot '' method inspired by mussel adhesive proteins for copolymerization of selenocystamine ( SeCA) and dopamine ( Dopa) to form a NO-generating coating on a 316 L stainless steel ( SS) stent. This `` one-pot '' method is environmentally friendly and easy to popularize , with many advantages including simple manufacturing procedure , high stability and no involvement of organic solvents. Such SeCA/Dopa coatings also enabled us to develop a catalytic surface for local NO-generation by reaction of endogenously existing S-nitrothiol species from fresh blood. We found that the developed SeCA/Dopa coatings could release NO in a controllable and stable manner for more than 60 days. Additionally , the released NO significantly inhibited smooth muscle cell ( SMC) proliferation and migration , as well as platelet activation and aggregation through the up-regulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate synthesis. Moreover , such NO generation enhanced the adhesion , proliferation and migration of endothelial cells ( ECs) , and achieved rapid in vivo re-endothelialization , effectively reducing in-stent restenosis and neointimal hyperplasia<disease>. We envision that the SeCA/Dopa-coated 316 L SS stent could be a promising platform for treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
