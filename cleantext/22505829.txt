  Sperm counts have rapidly declined in Western males over the past four decades. This rapid decline remains largely unexplained , but exposure to environmental toxicants provides one potential explanation for this decline. Flame retardants are highly prevalent and persistent in the environment , but many have not been assessed for their effects on human spermatogenesis. Using a human stem cell-based model of spermatogenesis , we evaluated two major flame retardants , hexabromocyclododecane ( HBCDD) and tetrabromobisphenol A ( TBBPA) , under acute conditions simulating occupational-level exposures. Here we show that HBCDD and TBBPA are human male reproductive toxicants
