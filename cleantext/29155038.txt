  Investigation of the internal tissues and organs of a macroscopic organism usually requires destructive processes , such as dissection or sectioning. These processes are inevitably associated with the loss of some spatial information. Recently , aqueous-based tissue clearing techniques , which allow whole-organ or even whole-body clearing of small rodents , have been developed and opened a new method of three-dimensional histology. It is expected that these techniques will be useful tools in the field of zoology , in which organisms with highly diverse morphology are investigated and compared. However , most of these new methods are optimized for soft , non-pigmented organs in small rodents , especially the brain , and their applicability to non-model organisms with hard exoskeletons and stronger pigmentation has not been tested. We explored the possible application of an aqueous-based tissue clearing technique , advanced CUBIC , on small crustaceans. The original CUBIC procedure did not clear the terrestrial isopod , In this study , we developed a method to clear whole tissues of crustaceans. To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of whole-mount clearing applied to crustaceans using an aqueous-based technique. This technique could facilitate morphological studies of crustaceans and other organisms with calcified exoskeletons and pigmentation.
