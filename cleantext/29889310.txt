  To investigate the effects of antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs; oxcarbazepine ( OXC) , levetiracetam ( LEV) , and lamotrigine ( LTG)) on semen quality , sexual function , and sex hormones in male adults with epilepsy. Individual treatment with OXC , LEV , or LTG was randomly assigned to 38 newly diagnosed male adult patients with epilepsy. Semen quality and sex hormones were measured before treatment and 6 months after taking the medicine. A questionnaire was administered using the International Index of Erectile Function Scale-5 and the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool Self-Assessment Scale to evaluate sexual function , followed by an analysis of the comparison between the treated patients and healthy volunteers ( healthy controls) as well as the changes and differences between the patients themselves before and after treatment. The total sperm count , fast forward movement rate ( FFMR) , survival rate , and normal sperm rate in the group with epilepsy were lower than those in healthy controls ( P < .05). The FFMR and survival rate of sperm after OXC treatment were significantly higher than before treatment ( P < .05). All semen parameters after LEV and LTG showed a possible trend for improvement , but no significant statistical difference. There was no significant difference in sexual function between patients and the control group , as well as before and after treatment with the 3 different AEDs. There was no significant difference in sex hormone levels in the epilepsy group before treatment compared with the healthy controls , or when compared after treatment with the 3 different AEDs. The marital rate and fertility rate of patients with epilepsy were significantly lower than those of healthy controls ( P < .05). The semen quality of males with epilepsy is decreased even before treatment. The AEDs ( OXC , LEV , and LTG) have no significant effect on sexual function and sex hormones , and OXC can improve the sperm FFMR and survival rate.
