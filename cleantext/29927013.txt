  The objective of the study is to investigate the relation between pretreatment depressive symptoms ( DS) and the course of DS during the first year after cancer diagnosis , and overall survival among people with head and neck cancer ( HNC). Data from the Head and Neck 5000 prospective clinical cohort study were used. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale ( HADS) pretreatment , at 4 and 12-month follow-up. Also , socio-demographic , clinical , lifestyle , and mortality data were collected. The association between before start of treatment DS ( HADS-depression > 7) and course ( never DS , recovered from DS , or persistent/recurrent/late DS at 12-month follow-up) and survival was investigated using Cox regression. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed. In total , 384 of the 2144 persons ( 18 %) reported pretreatment DS. Regarding DS course , 63 % never had DS , 16 % recovered , and 20 % had persistent/recurrent/late DS. People with pretreatment DS had a higher risk of earlier death than people without DS ( hazard ratio ( HR) = 1.65; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.33-2.05) , but this decreased after correcting for socio-demographic , clinical , and lifestyle-related factors ( HR = 1.21; 95 % CI 0.97-1.52). Regarding the course of DS , people with persistent/recurrent/late DS had a higher risk of earlier death ( HR = 2.04; 95 % CI 1.36-3.05) , while people who recovered had a comparable risk ( HR = 1.12; 95 % CI 0.66-1.90) as the reference group who never experienced DS. After correcting for socio-demographic and clinical factors , people with persistent/recurrent/late DS still had a higher risk of earlier death ( HR = 1.66; 95 % CI 1.09-2.53). Pretreatment DS and persistent/recurrent/late DS were associated with worse survival among people with HNC.
