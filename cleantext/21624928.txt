  Magnetic femoral nerve stimulation to test muscle function has been largely unexplored in older people. We assessed acceptability , feasibility , along with reproducibility and correlation with other physical function measures. Study 1 recruited older people with sarcopenia. Stimulation was performed at baseline and 2 weeks along with six minute walk ( 6MW) , maximum voluntary quadriceps contraction , short physical performance battery and grip strength. Acceptability was measured using visual analog scales. Study 2 used baseline data from a trial of older people. We correlated stimulation results with 6MW , maximal voluntary contraction and muscle mass. Maximum quadriceps twitch tension was measured in both studies , evoked using biphasic magnetic stimulation of the femoral nerve. In study 1 ( n = 12) , magnetic stimulation was well tolerated with mean discomfort rating of 9 % ( range 0-40 %) on a visual analog scale. Reproducibility was poor ( intraclass correlation coefficient 0.06; p = 0.44). Study 2 ( n = 64) showed only weak to moderate correlations for maximum quadriceps twitch tension with other measures of physical function ( 6 minute walk test r = 0.24 , p = 0.06; maximal voluntary contraction r = 0.26; p = 0.04). We conclude that magnetic femoral nerve stimulation is acceptable and feasible but poorly reproducible in older , functionally impaired people.
