  Permethrin is a Type I ( non-cyano) pyrethroid that induces tremors<symptom> at high concentrations and increases acoustic startle responses ( ASR) in adult rodents , however its effects in young rats have been investigated to a limited extent. ASR and tremor<symptom> were assessed in adult and postnatal day ( P) 15 Sprague-Dawley rats at oral doses of 60 , 90 , or 120 mg/kg over an 8 h period. Permethrin increased ASR in adults , regardless of dose , and 20 % of the high-dose rats showed tremor<symptom> at later time points. For the P15 rats all doses induced tremor<symptom> at all time points , and ASR was increased at 2 h in the 90 and 120 mg/kg groups with a trend in the 60 mg/kg group compared with controls. The 60 mg/kg group showed increased ASR at 4 and 6 h , whereas the 90 mg/kg group showed no differences from the controls at these times. The 120 mg/kg group showed decreased ASR from 4-8 h post-treatment. P15 and adult rats both showed plasma and brain cis- and trans-permethrin increases after dosing. After the same dose of permethrin , P15 rats had greater cis- and trans-permethrin in brain and plasma compared with adults. P15 rats had an increased tremor<symptom> response<symptom> compared with adults even at comparable brain permethrin concentrations. For ASR , P15 rats responded sooner and showed a biphasic pattern ranging from increased to decreased response as a function of dose and time , unlike adults that only showed increases. Overall , young rats showed greater effects from permethrin compared with adults.
