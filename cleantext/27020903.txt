  Synchronization based state estimation tries to synchronize a model with the true evolution of a system via the observations. In practice , an extra term is added to the model equations which hampers growth of instabilities transversal to the synchronization manifold. Therefore , there is a very close connection between synchronization and data assimilation. Recently , synchronization with time-delayed observations has been proposed , in which observations at future times are used to help synchronize a system that does not synchronize using only present observations , with remarkable successes. Unfortunately , these schemes are limited to small-dimensional problems. In this article , we lift that restriction by proposing an ensemble-based synchronization scheme. Tests were performed using the Lorenz '96 model for 20- , 100- and 1000-dimension systems. Results show global synchronization errors stabilizing at values of at least an order of magnitude lower than the observation errors , suggesting that the scheme is a promising tool to steer model states to the truth. While this framework is not a complete data assimilation method , we develop this methodology as a potential choice for a proposal density in a more comprehensive data assimilation method , like a fully nonlinear particle filter.
