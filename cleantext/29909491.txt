  Some trace elements may participate in the pathogenesis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD). This study aimed to investigate the trace element status of zinc ( Zn) , copper ( Cu) , iron ( Fe) , magnesium ( Mg) , and lead ( Pb) in children with ADHD , and to compare them with normal controls. Associations between examined elements and SNAP-IV rating scores of ADHD symptoms were also assessed. Four hundred nineteen children with ADHD ( 8.8 ± 2.1 years) and 395 matched normal controls ( 8.9 ± 1.7 years) were recruited in the study. The concentrations of Zn , Fe , Cu , Mg , and Pb in the whole blood were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. Lower zinc levels ( P < 0.001) and the number out of normal ranges ( P = 0.015) were found in children with ADHD when compared with the normal control group. The difference remained when adjusting the factor of BMI z-score. No significant between-group differences were found in levels of other elements. Zinc levels were negatively correlated with parent-rated scores of inattentive subscale of SNAP-IV ( r =- 0.40) as well as with total score of SNAP-IV ( r =- 0.24). Other significant associations were not observed. The present results indicated that there were alterations in blood levels of zinc , which was associated with the symptom scores of ADHD.
