  Magnetic resonance neurography is a technique for identifying anatomy and pathologic lesions<symptom> of nerves , and has emerged as a helpful technique for localizing lesions<symptom> and elucidating the underlying etiology. Ganglioneuromas are highly differentiated benign tumors. This lesion<symptom> is rare and exhibits undetermined symptoms , the features of using the magnetic resonance neurography are a great ally to determine its diagnosis. The authors illustrate a case of retroperitoneal ganglioneuroma emphasizing its image characteristics using magnetic resonance neurography with the diagnosis confirmed by histopathological examination.
