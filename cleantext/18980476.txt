  Schwann cell ( SC) transplantation has been comprehensively studied as a strategy for spinal cord injury ( SCI) repair. SCs are neuroprotective and promote axon regeneration and myelination. Nonetheless , substantial SC death occurs post-implantation , which limits therapeutic efficacy. The use of extracellular matrix ( ECM)- derived matrices , such as Matrigel , supports transplanted SC survival and axon growth , resulting in improved motor function. Because appropriate matrices are needed for clinical translation , we test here the use of an acellular injectable peripheral nerve ( iPN) matrix. Implantation of SCs in iPN into a contusion lesion<symptom> did not alter immune cell infiltration compared to injury only controls. iPN implants were larger and contained twice as many SC-myelinated axons as Matrigel grafts. SC/iPN animals performed as well as the SC/Matrigel group in the BBB locomotor test , and made fewer errors on the grid walk at 4 weeks , equalizing at 8 weeks. The fact that this clinically relevant iPN matrix is immunologically tolerated and supports SC survival and axon growth within the graft offers a highly translational possibility for improving efficacy of SC treatment after SCI. To our knowledge , it is the first time that an injectable PN matrix is being evaluated to improve the efficacy of SC transplantation in SCI repair.
