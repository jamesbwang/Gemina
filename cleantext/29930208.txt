  Here we report our treatment results of low back and leg<symptom> pain<symptom> ( LBLP) considering para-lumbar spine disease ( PLSD) and peripheral nerve neuropathy ( PNN). We enrolled 103 patients who were admitted to our institute for LBLP treatment between January and December in 2014. For the treatment , we preferentially performed intensive block therapy for PLSD. Among 103 patients , 89 patients had PLSD. In 85 patients , we performed intensive block therapy and 82 patients experienced short-term improvement of symptoms. In 35 of these 82 patients , lumbar spine and/or PNN surgical treatment was required as the effect of block therapy was transient. Intensive block therapy was effective in 47 of 103 patients ( 45.6 %) , and the remaining patients required surgical treatment ( PLSD and/or PNN: 31 cases , lumbar spine: 13 cases , both: 8 cases). Among 103 patients with LBLP , intensive block therapy for PLSD and PNN was useful for short-term symptom improvement in 82 patients ( 79.6 %) , and for long-term symptom improvement in 47 patients ( 45.6 %) as evaluated at the final follow-up. Surgical treatment of PLSD and/or PNN was required in 39 patients ( 37.9 %). These results suggested that treatment of PLSD and PNN might yield good results for patients with LBLP.
