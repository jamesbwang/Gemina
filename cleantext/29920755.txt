  Anthropogenic activity is increasing the presence of contaminants that enter waterways through wastewater effluent and urban and/or agricultural runoff , generally in complex mixtures. Depending on the mode of action of the individual contaminant within the mixture , toxicity can occur due to contaminants having similar or dissimilar modes of action. However , it is unknown how the metabolome responds to sublethal contaminant mixtures in the keystone genus Daphnia. In the present study we examined D. magna<pathogen> metabolic responses to acute sublethal exposure of propranolol , carbamazepine , and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid ( PFOS) as well as in binary ( propranolol-carbamazepine , propranolol-PFOS , carbamazepine-PFOS) and tertiary mixtures ( carbamazepine-propranolol-PFOS) , all at 10 % of the median lethal concentration of the population ( LC50). The metabolome was measured using
