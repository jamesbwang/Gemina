  Diabetes mellitus ( DM) has been proven to be a key risk factor for cognitive impairment. Previous studies have implicated hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in diabetes-related cognitive impairment. However , the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1) is a protein deacetylase depended on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Furthermore , it is indispensable in normal learning and memory. Whether SIRT1 is taken part in diabetes-induced neuronal apoptosis and thus involve in the development of diabetic cognitive impairment is still not clear. To address this issue , we examined the possible role of SIRT1 in hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in streptozotocin
