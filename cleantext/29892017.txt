  High sensitivity , fast response time and strong light absorption are the most important metrics for infrared sensing and imaging. The trade-off between these characteristics remains the primary challenge in bolometry. Graphene with its unique combination of a record small electronic heat capacity and a weak electron-phonon coupling has emerged as a sensitive bolometric medium that allows for high intrinsic bandwidths
