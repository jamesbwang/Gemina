  Solar ultraviolet ( sUV) irradiation is a major environmental carcinogen that can cause inflammation<symptom> and skin cancer. The costs and morbidity associated with skin cancer are increasing , and therefore identifying molecules that can help prevent skin carcinogenesis is important. In this study , we identified the p53-related protein kinase ( PRPK) as a novel oncogenic protein that is phosphorylated by the T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase ( TOPK). Knockdown of TOPK inhibited PRPK phosphorylation and conferred resistance to solar-simulated light ( SSL)- induced skin carcinogenesis in mouse models. In the clinic , acute SSL irradiation significantly increased epidermal thickness as well as total protein and phosphorylation levels of TOPK and PRPK in human skin tissues. We identified two PRPK inhibitors , FDA-approved rocuronium bromide ( Zemuron
