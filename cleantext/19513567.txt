  Osteosarcoma , the most common malignant bone tumor with recurring disease or lung metastases , has become one of the leading causes of death in humans. In the current study , we made an investigation on the anticancer effect of glaucocalyxin A , a bioactive ent-kauranoid diterpenoid isolated from Rabdosia japonica<pathogen> var. , and unraveled the underlying mechanisms. Here , we found that Glaucocalyxin A inhibited the cell viability of numerous osteosarcoma cells. Our results showed that Glaucocalyxin A exerted the pro-apoptotic effect on human osteosarcoma cells , MG-63 and HOS cells. Glaucocalyxin A induced apoptosis by mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through several steps including increasing the Bax/Bcl -2 ratio , triggering the intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS) generation , reducing mitochondrial membrane potential ( MMP) , and inducing cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3. We demonstrated that Glaucocalyxin A induced apoptosis via inhibiting Five-zinc finger Glis 1 ( GLI1) activation by overexpression and knockdown of GLI1 in vitro. We also found that Glaucocalyxin A inhibited GLI1 activation via regulating phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B ( PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway. We further confirmed our findings by using PI3K activator and inhibitor to verify the inhibitory effect of Glaucocalyxin A on PI3K/Akt/GLI1 pathway. Moreover , our in vivo study revealed that glaucocalyxin A possessed a remarkable antitumor effect with no toxicity in the xenograft model inoculated with HOS tumor through the same mechanisms as in vitro. In conclusion , our results suggested that Glaucocalyxin A induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma by inhibiting nuclear translocation of GLI1 via regulating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Thus , Glaucocalyxin A might be a potential candidate for human osteosarcoma in the future.
