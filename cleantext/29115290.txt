  Stainless steel 316 L prepared by laser melting consisted of a hierarchical austenitic microstructure with micrometre-sized ( 10-25 µm) grains containing fine 1 µm subgrains with a cellular structure. At high-temperature thermal treatments ( greater than or equal to 1100 °C) , merging and growth of the 1 µm subgrains into bigger subgrains restricted the rapid grain growth and microstructure coarsening. Partial phase transformation of austenite to ferrite at temperatures greater than or equal to 1100 °C , in combination with gradual and steady growth of subgrains inside the micrometre-sized grains and nucleation of the sigma phase , has promoted the tensile strength of stainless steel 316 L to 300 MPa at 1100 °C compared with that of conventionally made 316 L counterparts ( approx. 40 MPa). The grain growth mechanism of the laser-melted microstructure can change the application criteria for 316 L and expand the application fields for 316 L.
