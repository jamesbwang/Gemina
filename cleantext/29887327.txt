  Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( ANCA) directed to proteinase 3 ( PR3) used to be considered the serologic marker for granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( GPA). However , patients with myeloperoxidase ( MPO)- ANCA positive GPA have been increasingly reported. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and pathological characteristics and outcome of Chinese patients with MPO-ANCA positive GPA. The clinical and renal histology data , renal outcomes , response to treatment , relapse and mortality were compared between patients with MPO-ANCA positive GPA and MPO-ANCA positive microscopic polyangiitis ( MPA) as well as proteinase 3 ( PR3)- ANCA positive GPA. 455 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis ( AAV) were recruited in this study. 276/455 patients were classified as MPO-ANCA positive MPA , 4/455 patients were classified as PR3-ANCA positive MPA , 124/455 were MPO-ANCA positive GPA and 51/455 were PR3-ANCA positive GPA. Compared with MPO-ANCA positive MPA patients , MPO-ANCA positive GPA patients had significantly higher level of BVAS and milder renal lesion<symptom> at diagnosis. The probability of developing ESRD was significantly higher in patients with MPO-ANCA positive MPA than MPO-ANCA positive GPA. MPO-ANCA positive GPA patients were likely to have relapse than MPO-ANCA positive MPA patients. Compared with PR3-ANCA positive GPA patients , MPO-ANCA positive GPA patients had significantly higher proportion of female , less constitutional symptoms and milder renal lesion<symptom> at diagnosis. Patients with MPO-ANCA positive GPA should be regarded as a unique subset of AAV. This subset of AAV patients had relatively milder renal injury. Although ANCA specificities play an important role in differentiating AAV , taking the disease type together to classify AAV may be more rational.
