  A proposed California law will require student health centers at public universities to provide medication abortion<disease> To understand its potential impact , we sought to describe current travel time , costs , and wait times to access care at the nearest abortion<disease> facilities. We projected total medication abortion<disease> use based on campus enrollment figures and age- and state-adjusted abortion<disease> rates. We calculated distance and public transit time from campuses to the nearest abortion<disease> facility. We contacted existing abortion-providing facilities to determine costs , insurance acceptance , and wait times. We estimate 322 to 519 California public university students seek medication abortions<disease> each month. As many as 62 % of students at these universities were more than 30 minutes from the closest abortion<disease> facility via public transportation. Average cost of medication abortion<disease> was $ 604 , and average wait time to the first available appointment was one week. College students face cost , scheduling , and travel barriers to abortion<disease> care. Offering medication abortion<disease> on campus could reduce these barriers.
