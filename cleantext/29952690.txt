  Testicular atrophy and testesterone insufficiency have been commonly reported associated with chronic liver diseases. Though testosterone dependent , the epididymal changes induced by liver disease have never been studied before. Thus , this study aimed to assess the ultrastructural events in the epididymis of rats with chronic obstructive jaundice. Chronic cholestasis induced many epididymal structural alterations manifested by the reduced tubular diameters , thickening of the tubular basement membrane , and regression of the principal cells. This was accompanied with reduction of principal cell organelles , cytoplasmic vacuolations , nuclear alterations , and stereovilli loss. The results establish that chronic cholestasis causes epididymal structural changes due to androgen deficiency.
