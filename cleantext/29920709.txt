  Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis<disease> ( AHO) , often occurring in young children , is the most frequently diagnosed type of osteomyelitis<disease> in pediatric patients. Optimizing antibiotics is essential as delays to receipt of appropriate therapy can lead to chronic osteomyelitis<disease> , as well as impairments in bone growth and development. Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs ( ASPs) are in a key position to help improve the care of patients with AHO as they contain a pharmacist with expertise in antibiotic drug selection , optimization of dosing , and microbiologic test review. A literature search of the Medline database was conducted from initiation through January 2018. Articles selected for the review focus on pathogen identification , pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics , efficacy and safety in children , transition from intravenous to oral therapy , duration of treatment , and antimicrobial stewardship interventions. This review will highlight the potential roles ASPs can have in improving the management of AHO in pediatric patients. These roles include the creation of clinical pathways , improving testing algorithms , antibiotic choice and dosing , intravenous to oral transitions , duration of treatment , and therapy monitoring. Overall , patients are most effectively treated by focusing treatments on age , presentation , local sensitivities , and directed therapy with pathogen identification.
