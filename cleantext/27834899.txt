  This study explores how emergency shelters can adapt to a multi-hazard environment by geographic information system ( GIS) and takes Guangzhou as a case for analysis. The physical suitability of the overall urban resources was first assessed by aiming to select the suitable resources and safe locations for emergency shelters in the context of multiple disasters. Afterward , by analyzing the scale and spatial distribution of affected areas and populations under different types of disaster scenarios , the demand for different kinds of shelters were predicted. Lastly , taking into account the coverage of the affected people , shelters were allocated according to different conditions in the districts. This work will hopefully provide a reference for the construction of emergency shelters and help form emergency operations in order to mitigate the impact of hazards. The issues identified in the study need to be further studied in medium or small-scale cities.
