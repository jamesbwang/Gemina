  In this work , the bio-nanohybrids of magnesium-aluminum layered double hydroxide intercalated with zwitterionic histidine ( His-LDH) was synthesized. The crystal phase , morphology , and nanostructure of the as-prepared His-LDH were characterized by X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR) , and nitrogen adsorption-desorption methods. The His-LDHs were used to remove anionic dyes , including Congo red ( CR) , indigo carmine ( IC) and sunset yellow FCF ( SY) from aqueous solutions. The detailed investigation of the kinetics and the adsorption isotherms of CR , IC and SY from aqueous solutions showed that the dyes adsorb rapidly , in accordance with a pseudo-second-order kinetics and a Freundlich adsorption isotherm model. The remarkably high adsorption capacity of the dyes on the His-LDH ( efficiency of CR removal , 99.98 %; maximum specific removal q
