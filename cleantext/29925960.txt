  Lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs) have been by far the most prevalent cell type used to study the genetics underlying normal and disease-relevant human phenotypic variation , across personal to epidemiological scales. In contrast , only few studies have explored the use of LCLs in functional genomics and mechanistic studies. Two major reasons are technical , as ( 1) interrogating the sub-cellular spatial information of LCLs is challenged by their non-adherent nature , and ( 2) LCLs are refractory to gene transfection. Methodological details relating to techniques that overcome these limitations are scarce , largely inadequate ( without additional knowledge and expertise) , and optimisation has never been described. Here we compare , optimise , and convey such methods in-depth. We provide a robust method to adhere LCLs to coverslips , which maintained cellular integrity , morphology , and permitted visualisation of sub-cellular structures and protein localisation. Next , we developed the use of lentiviral-based gene delivery to LCLs. Through empirical and combinatorial testing of multiple transduction conditions , we improved transduction efficiency from 3 % up to 48 %. Furthermore , we established strategies to purify transduced cells , to achieve sustainable cultures containing > 85 % transduced cells. Collectively , our methodologies provide a vital resource that enables the use of LCLs in functional cell and molecular biology experiments. Potential applications include the characterisation of genetic variants of unknown significance , the interrogation of cellular disease pathways and mechanisms , and high-throughput discovery of genetic modifiers of disease states among others.
