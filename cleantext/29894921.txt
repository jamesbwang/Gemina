  Up to 20 % of patients presenting at an emergency room ( ER) after a stressful event will for several months suffer from very diverse long-lasting symptoms and a potentially significant decline in quality of life , often described as post concussion-like symptoms ( PCLS). The objectives of our randomized open-label single-center study were to assess the feasibility of psychologist-led interventions in the context of the ER and to compare the effect of eye movement<symptom> desensitization and reprocessing ( EMDR) with reassurance and usual care. Conducted in the ER of Bordeaux University Hospital , the study included patients with a high risk of PCLS randomized in three groups: a 15-min reassurance session , a 60-min session of EMDR , and usual care. Main outcomes were the proportion of interventions that could be carried out and the prevalence of PCSL and post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD) three months after the ER visit. One hundred and thirty patients with a high risk of PCLS were randomized. No logistic problem or patient refusal was observed. In the EMDR , reassurance and control groups , proportions of patients with PCLS at three months were 18 % , 37 % and 65 % and those with PTSD were 3 % , 16 % and 19 % respectively. The risk ratio for PCLS adjusted for the type of event ( injury , non-injury) for the comparison between EMDR and control was 0.36 ( 95 % CI 0.20-0.66). This is the first randomized controlled trial that shows that a short EMDR intervention is feasible and potentially effective in the context of the ER. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT03194386).
