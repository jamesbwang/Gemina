  The aims of this systematic review were to examine the effects of the overall and the different types of the interventions on the do-not-resuscitate ( DNR) designation and the time between DNR and death among cancer patients. Data were searched from the databases of PubMed , CINAHL , EMbase , Medline , and Cochrane Library through 2 November 2017. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were ( 1) randomized control trails , quasi-experimental study , and retrospective observational studies and ( 2) used outcome indicators of DNR designation rates. The Effective Public Health Practice Project tool was used to assess the overall quality of the included studies. The 14 studies with a total of 7,180 participants were included in this review. There were 78.6 % ( 11 of 14) studies that indicated that the interventions could improve the DNR designation rates. Three types of DNR interventions were identified in this review: palliative care unit service , palliative consultation services , and patient-physician communication program. The significant increases of the time between DNR designation and death only occurred in a patient-physician communication program. The palliative care unit service provided a continuing care model to reduce unnecessary utilization of healthcare service. The palliative consultation service is a new care model to meet the needs of cancer patients in non-palliative care unit. The share decision-making communication program and physician 's compassion attitudes facilitate to make DNR decision early. The individualized DNR program needs to be developed according to the needs of cancer patients.
