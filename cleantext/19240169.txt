  Immunotherapies are set to become part of the therapeutic repertoire for breast cancer in the near future. Active vaccination is a promising strategy , especially in tumors that have a specific tumor-associated antigen. Although cellular immunotherapies have not yet shown efficacy , new technologies are on the way to improve this approach. Given the recent Food and Drug Administration approval of chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) T cells for leukemia<disease> , it is only a question of time before solid tumors will follow. However , not all breast cancer patients will respond to cellular or other immunotherapy. Hence , we must define subpopulations of breast cancer patients who benefit from this new approach.
