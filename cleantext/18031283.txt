  Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> ( AMF) belong to Glomeromycotina , and are mutualistic symbionts of many land plants. Associated bacteria accompany AMF during their lifecycle to establish a robust tripartite association consisting of fungi<pathogen> , plants and bacteria. Physical association among this trinity provides possibilities for the exchange of genetic materials. However , very few horizontal gene transfer ( HGT) from bacteria or plants to AMF has been reported yet. In this study , we complement existing algorithms by developing a new pipeline , Blast2hgt , to efficiently screen for putative horizontally derived genes from a whole genome. Genome analyses of the glomeromycete
