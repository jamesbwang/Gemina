  This review aimed to examine and analyse the definitions used for antipsychotic response in delusional disorder ( DD) and to provide a discussion of the methodology used. A systematic review was performed using the PubMed , Scopus and PsycINFO databases ( 1990-October 2017) according to the PRISMA statement. In addition , reference searches were performed manually through identified studies to obtain other relevant articles. The search terms included ` antipsychotic response ' , ` antipsychotics ' , ` treatment response ' and ` delusional disorder '. After the screening and selection processes , 11 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria using different methods to define antipsychotic response in DD. Studies included chart reviews ( n = 5) and observer-rated scales ( n = 6) , in which two studies used the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale , two studies evaluated antipsychotic response by mean changes from the baseline to endpoint scores ( Positive and Negative Syndrome<disease> Scale ( PANSS) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) , one study combined the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale and mean changes from baseline scores ( PANSS) and one study reported responder rates on the basis of a scale-derived cut-off ( PANSS). A lack of consensus in the definitions of antipsychotic response in DD and a high degree of heterogeneity of the methods used are reflected. Recent proposals on the use of scale-derived cut-offs to evaluate antipsychotic response in schizophrenia would be highly recommended for DD research.
