  Tropical corals are often associated with dinitrogen ( N2)- fixing bacteria ( diazotrophs) , and seasonal changes in key environmental parameters , such as dissolved inorganic nitrogen ( DIN) availability and seawater temperature , are known to affect N2 fixation in coral-microbial holobionts. Despite , then , such potential for seasonal and depth-related changes in N2 fixation in reef corals , such variation has not yet been investigated. Therefore , this study quantified seasonal ( winter vs. summer) N2 fixation rates associated with the reef-building coral Stylophora pistillata collected from depths of 5 , 10 and 20 m in the northern Gulf of Aqaba ( Red Sea). Findings revealed that corals from all depths exhibited the highest N2 fixation rates during the oligotrophic summer season , when up to 11 % of their photo-metabolic nitrogen demand ( CPND) could be met by N2 fixation. While N2 fixation remained seasonally stable for deep corals ( 20 m) , it significantly decreased for the shallow corals ( 5 and 10 m) during the DIN-enriched winter season , accounting for less than 2 % of the corals ' CPND. This contrasting seasonal response in N2 fixation across corals of different depths could be driven by 1) release rates of coral-derived organic matter , 2) the community composition of the associated diazotrophs , and/or 3) nutrient acquisition by the Symbiodinium community.
