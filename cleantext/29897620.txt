  The polar transport of auxin controls many aspects of plant development. However , the molecular mechanisms underlying auxin tranport regulation remain to be further elucidated. We identified a mutant named as usl1 ( unflattened and small leaves) in a genetic screen in Arabidopsis thaliana. The usl1 displayed multiple aspects of developmental defects in leaves , embryogenesis , cotyledons , silique phyllotaxy and lateral roots in addition to abnormal leaves. USL1 encodes a protein orthologous to the yeast vacuolar protein sorting ( Vps) 38p and human UV RADIATION RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED GENE ( UVRAG). Cell biology , Co-IP/MS and yeast two-hybrid were used to identify the function of USL1. USL1 colocalizes at the subcellular level with VPS29 , a key factor of the retromer complex that controls auxin transport. The morphology of the VPS29-associated late endosomes ( LE) is altered from small dots in the wild-type to aberrant enlarged circles in the usl1 mutants. The usl1 mutant synergistically interacts with vps29. We also found that USL1 forms a complex with AtVPS30 and AtVPS34. We propose that USL1 controls multiple aspects of plant development by affecting late endosome morphology and by regulating the PIN1 polarity. Our findings provide a new layer of the understanding on the mechanisms of plant development regulation.
