  This review focuses on the question whether mindfulness in follow-up care can contribute to the prevention of breast cancer ( BC) recurrence. We first introduce behavioral risk and protective factors in follow-up care by presenting current research outcomes modulating individual risk for recurrence. We argue that although increased self-awareness is undoubtedly beneficial for BC survivors , it may also trigger adverse effects in vulnerable individuals such as overarousal and impaired emotional regulation. Indeed , research shows that many BC survivors are often confronted with clinical levels of fear of recurrence and anxiety<symptom> and depressive symptoms. Research on awareness about the impact of behavior on health and fear of recurrence also offers interesting insights which can help to better understand non-compliant responses of BC survivors to medical recommendations regarding lifestyle or screening in follow-up care. Given the high rate of clinically relevant symptoms such as fear of recurrence and anxiety<symptom> that may be related to dysfunctional levels of self-monitoring , we review the effects of a therapeutic intervention called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR) that appears promising in reintegrating self-observation with patient well-being.
