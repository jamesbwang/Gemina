  Aims and methodTo describe the pattern of referrals and characteristics of people aged over 18 seeking gender reassignment in Oxfordshire over a 6-year period ( 2011-2016). A total of 153 individuals attended for assessment ( of 162 referred); 97 ( 63.4 %) were natal males and 56 ( 36.6 %) were natal females. Mean age at referral was markedly different between the two groups , with females being younger. The number of referral significantly increased over the time period , by an average of 18 % per year ( 95 % CI 1.08-1.30). Eighty-seven patients sought transition from male to female , and 46 from female to male , while a smaller group ( n = 13) had non-binary presentations. Twelve patients ( 7.8 %) had autism spectrum disorder.Clinical implicationsThere are various possible reasons for the increased demand for services for people with gender dysphoria , which we discuss here. When planning services in the UK , both the increase in overall referral rates and the apparent earlier age at referral should be taken into account.Declaration of interestNone.
