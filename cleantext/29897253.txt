  Curcumin and genistein are two natural products obtained from Curcuma longa L. and soybeans , endowed with many biological properties. Within the last years they were shown to possess also a promising antitrypanosomal activity. In the present paper , we investigated the activity of both curcumin and genistein against rhodesain , the main cysteine protease of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense; drug combination studies , according to Chou and Talalay method , allowed us to demonstrate a potent synergistic effect for the combination curcumin-genistein. As a matter of fact , with our experiments we observed that the combination index of curcumin-genistein is < 1 for the reduction from 10 to 90 % of rhodesain activity.
