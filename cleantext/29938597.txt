  Recently , NIH has funded a center for autophagy research named the Autophagy , Inflammation<symptom> , and Metabolism ( AIM) Center of Biomedical Research Excellence , located at the University of New Mexico Health Science Center ( UNM HSC) , with aspirations to promote autophagy research locally , nationally , and internationally. The center has 3 major missions: ( i) to support junior faculty in their endeavors to develop investigations in this area and obtain independent funding; ( ii) to develop and provide technological platforms to advance autophagy research with emphasis on cellular approaches for high quality reproducible research; and ( iii) to foster international collaborations through the formation of an International Council of Affiliate Members and through hosting national and international workshops and symposia. Scientifically , the AIM center is focused on autophagy and its intersections with other processes , with emphasis on both fundamental discoveries and applied translational research.
