  Besides stricture formation , diminished esophageal motility after caustic esophageal burns also plays a role in the deterioration of the clinical course. In this study , we aimed to investigate the effect of caustic burn on the esophageal contractions and the effect of platelet-rich plasma ( PRP) on these changes. Twenty-one Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups ( Sham operation ( n = 8) , caustic esophageal burn with NaOH ( n = 6) , PRP treatment after caustic burn ( n = 7)). After 3 weeks , esophagectomy was performed and contractions and EFS responses were evaluated in the organ bath. KCl- and acetylcholine-induced responses were reduced in the Burn group , but increased in Sham and PRP groups ( p < 0.05). EFS responses were higher in Burn group compared to the other groups. Response with L-arginine was increased in Burn group , but decreased in PRP group. There was more decrease in the contraction in Sham and PRP groups compared to the Burn group after SNP ( sodium nitroprusside) incubation ( p < 0.05). L-NAME ( NÏ‰-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) did not change the EFS responses in the Burn group , but EFS responses were decreased significantly in Sham and PRP groups ( p < 0.05). EFS responses were decreased in all groups , but more in the Sham and PRP groups after Y-27632 ( Rho-kinase inhibitor) incubation ( p < 0.05). For the first time , we demonstrated that both cholinergic and non-adrenergic non-cholinergic mechanisms are responsible for the altered motility in corrosive esophageal injury. Our results suggest that PRP treatment may be helpful in regulating the esophageal motility and decreasing altered contractions in corrosive burns. This effect may also contribute to the reduction of stricture formation , especially by reducing inappropriate contractions of the esophageal wall during the post-burn healing phase.
