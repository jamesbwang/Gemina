  We demonstrate that a Drosophila Golgi protein , Gorab , is present not only in the trans-Golgi but also in the centriole cartwheel where , complexed to Sas6 , it is required for centriole duplication. In addition to centriole defects , flies lacking Gorab are uncoordinated due to defects in sensory cilia , which lose their nine-fold symmetry. We demonstrate the separation of centriole and Golgi functions of Drosophila Gorab in two ways: first , we have created Gorab variants that are unable to localize to trans-Golgi but can still rescue the centriole and cilia defects of gorab null flies; second , we show that expression of C-terminally tagged Gorab disrupts Golgi functions in cytokinesis of male meiosis , a dominant phenotype overcome by mutations preventing Golgi targeting. Our findings suggest that during animal evolution , a Golgi protein has arisen with a second , apparently independent , role in centriole duplication.
