  Most recent breakthroughs in understanding cell adhesion , cell migration , and cellular mechanosensitivity have been made possible by the development of engineered cell substrates of well-defined surface properties. Traditionally , these substrates mimic the extracellular matrix ( ECM) environment by the use of ligand-functionalized polymeric gels of adjustable stiffness. However , such ECM mimetics are limited in their ability to replicate the rich dynamics found at cell-cell contacts. This review focuses on the application of cell surface mimetics , which are better suited for the analysis of cell adhesion , cell migration , and cellular mechanosensitivity across cell-cell interfaces. Functionalized supported lipid bilayer systems were first introduced as biomembrane-mimicking substrates to study processes of adhesion maturation during adhesion of functionalized vesicles ( cell-free assay) and plated cells. However , while able to capture adhesion processes , the fluid lipid bilayer of such a relatively simple planar model membrane prevents adhering cells from transducing contractile forces to the underlying solid , making studies of cell migration and cellular mechanosensitivity largely impractical. Therefore , the main focus of this review is on polymer-tethered lipid bilayer architectures as biomembrane-mimicking cell substrate. Unlike supported lipid bilayers , these polymer-lipid composite materials enable the free assembly of linkers into linker clusters at cellular contacts without hindering cell spreading and migration and allow the controlled regulation of mechanical properties , enabling studies of cellular mechanosensitivity. The various polymer-tethered lipid bilayer architectures and their complementary properties as cell substrates are discussed.
