  Phenotypic image analysis is the task of recognizing variations in cell properties using microscopic image data. These variations , produced through a complex web of interactions between genes and the environment , may hold the key to uncover important biological phenomena or to understand the response to a drug candidate. Today , phenotypic analysis is rarely performed completely by hand. The abundance of high-dimensional image data produced by modern high-throughput microscopes necessitates computational solutions. Over the past decade , a number of software tools have been developed to address this need. They use statistical learning methods to infer relationships between a cell 's phenotype and data from the image. In this review , we examine the strengths and weaknesses<symptom> of non-commercial phenotypic image analysis software , cover recent developments in the field , identify challenges , and give a perspective on future possibilities.
