  Catechol estrogens ( CEs) are metabolic electrophiles that actively undergo covalent interaction with cellular proteins , influencing molecular function. There is no feasible method to identify their binders in a living system. Herein , we developed a click chemistry-based approach using ethinylestradiol ( EE2) as the precursor probe coupled with quantitative proteomics to identify protein targets of CEs and classify their binding strengths. Using in situ metabolic conversion and click reaction in liver microsomes , CEs-protein complex was captured by the probe , digested by trypsin , stable isotope labeled via reductive amination , and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ( LC-MS). A total of 334 liver proteins were repeatedly identified ( n â‰¥ 2); 274 identified proteins were classified as strong binders based on precursor mass mapping. The binding strength was further scaled by D/H ratio ( activity probe/solvent): 259 strong binders had D/H > 5.25; 46 weak binders had 5.25 > D/H > 1; 5 nonspecific binders ( keratins) had D/H < 1. These results were confirmed using spiked covalent control ( strong binder) and noncovalent control ( weak binder) , as well as in vitro testing of cytochrome c ( D/H = 5.9) , which showed covalent conjugation with CEs. Many identified strong binders , such as glutathione transferase , catechol-O-methyl transferase , superoxide dismutase , catalase , glutathione peroxidase , and cytochrome c , are involved in cellular redox processes or detoxification activities. CE conjugation was shown to suppress the superoxide oxidase activity of cytochrome c , suggesting that CEs modification may alter the redox action of cellular proteins. Due to structural similarity and inert alkyne group , EE2 probe is very likely to capture protein targets of CEs in general. Thus , this strategy can be adopted to explore the biological impact of CEs modification in living systems.
