  Cardiac translational and rotational vibrations induced by left ventricular motions are measurable using joint seismocardiography ( SCG) and gyrocardiography ( GCG) techniques. Multi-dimensional non-invasive monitoring of the heart reveals relative information of cardiac wall motion. A single inertial measurement unit ( IMU) allows capturing cardiac vibrations in sufficient details and enables us to perform patient screening for various heart conditions. We envision smartphone mechanocardiography ( MCG) for the use of e-health or telemonitoring , which uses a multi-class classifier to detect various types of cardiovascular diseases ( CVD) using only smartphone 's built-in internal sensors data. Such smartphone App/solution could be used by either a healthcare professional and/or the patient him/herself to take recordings from their heart. We suggest that smartphone could be used to separate heart conditions such as normal sinus rhythm ( SR) , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AFib) , coronary artery disease ( CAD) , and possibly ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction ( STEMI) in multiclass settings. An application could run the disease screening and immediately inform the user about the results. Widespread availability of IMUs within smartphones could enable the screening of patients globally in the future , however , we also discuss the possible challenges raised by the utilization of such self-monitoring systems.
