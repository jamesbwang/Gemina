  A novel nonconjugated polymer named poly ( 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid sodium salt) ( PAMPS-Na) was designed and synthesized. The PAMPS-Na has good solubility in polar solvents , such as water , methanol , and ethanol , which can be used as the cathode buffer layer in organic solar cells ( OSCs) through solution processing without damaging the underlying active layer. Moreover , it was found that PAMPS-Na can significantly decrease the Al work function when it was modified with Al.. To reveal its universal application in organic photovoltaic devices , a variety of photovoltaic donor materials , including two medium-band gap polymers , a wide-band gap polymer , and a small molecule donor were employed to fabricate OSCs. Compared with OSCs with Ca/Al electrode , the devices based on PAMPS-Na/Al exhibited higher photovoltaic performance , mainly because of the increased short-circuit current. Additionally , OSCs with PAMPS-Na/Al displayed better ambient stability than devices with Ca/Al. It is also interesting to find that the performance of the devices can tolerate a wide change of PAMPS-Na 's thickness , enabling the potential for large-scale fabrication of OSCs. The results suggest that PAMPS-Na is a promising candidate as the cathode buffer layer to improve the efficiency and stability of OSCs.
