  Among patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD) , depression<symptom> is prevalent and disabling , impacting both health outcomes and quality of life. There is a critical need for alternative pharmacological methods to treat PD depression<symptom> , as mainstream antidepressant drugs are largely ineffective in this population. Currently , there are no recommendations for the optimal treatment of PD neuropsychiatric symptoms. Given the dual antidepressant and anti-dyskinetic effects of ketamine and other N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA) antagonists for PD , this review aims to examine the current evidence of NMDA antagonists for treating neuropsychiatric symptoms , including memantine , amantadine , ketamine , dizoclopine , and d-cycloserine. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed database. We also searched the following databases up to March 1 , 2018: Ovid MEDLINE , PsycINFO , CINAHL , Google Scholar , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The following keywords were used: NMDA antagonist and Parkinson 's disease. Two authors independently reviewed the articles identified from the search using specific selection criteria , focusing on studies of mood , psychiatric condition , depression<symptom> , cognition , and quality of life , and the consensus was reached on the 20 studies included. There is a preliminary evidence that NMDA antagonists may modulate psychiatric symptoms in PD. However , current evidence of psychiatric symptom-modifying effects is inconclusive and requires that further trials be conducted in PD. The repurposing of old NMDA antagonists , such as ketamine for depression<symptom> and newer therapies , such as rapastinel , suggests that there is an emerging place for modulating the glutamatergic system for treating non-motor symptoms in PD.
