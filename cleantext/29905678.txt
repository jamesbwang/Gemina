  The generation of Cherenkov radiation from soliton compression of 1550 nm pulses in tapered photonic crystal fibers is analyzed numerically , with a view to generating short-wavelength-tunable output pulses in the visible range. It is shown that low-noise femtosecond light sources with spectral power densities approaching those of existing supercontinuum sources are feasible with existing fiber laser and tapering technology.
