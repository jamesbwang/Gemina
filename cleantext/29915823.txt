  Different shapes of Co-aggregates were synthesized via reduction of a Co salt ( CoCl2 Â· 6H2O) by chemical precipitation using glycerol , ethylene glycol and ethanol as solvents. The effect of solvent on the morphology , fcc or hcp phase-content and the magnetic properties of the synthesized samples were investigated. The Co-aggregates synthesized using glycerol have a dense spherical shape and high saturation magnetization ( MS) , whereas ethylene glycol leads to formation of flower-shaped spherical aggregates through loose packing of smaller plate-like particles which have a moderate MS value. When ethanol was used as a solvent , a dendritic ( leaf like)- shape of the aggregates with the lowest MS value was obtained. The formation of the obtained morphology of the aggregates was explained based on the size of the solvent molecule , the viscosity of the solvent and the number of polar groups (- OH) present in the solvent molecules. The magnetic domain state and domain wall dynamics of all the Co-samples were investigated using 59Co Internal Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( IFNMR) spectroscopy at RT and at 77 K. Through the IFNMR spectroscopy , the presence of gain boundaries , single domain particles and multi-domain particles/aggregates with domain walls associated with fcc and hcp phases were identified and quantified. We observed that the use of ethanol facilitates formation of a higher amount of hcp phase in the sample than the use of glycerol or ethylene glycol.
