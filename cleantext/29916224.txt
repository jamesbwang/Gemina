  Background/aim: This study was designed to examine the effect of tadalafil , a phosphodiesterase ( PDE) 5 inhibitor , on the severity of joint and muscle damage in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis<disease> ( AA). Materials and methods: AA was induced by intradermal inoculation into right hind paw of male Sprague Dawley rats ( 300-450g) with complete Freund 's adjuvant ( CFA; 0.1 mL). AA rats were treated with either tadalafil ( 10 mg/kg; per oral) alone or along with the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H- ( 1,2,4) oxadiazolo ( 4,3-a) quinoxalin-1-one ( ODQ; 10 mg/kg; intraperitoneally). After decapitation on day 16 , trunk blood was collected for total oxidant status ( TOS) and total antioxidant capacity ( TAC) assays. The left metatarsophalangeal joint and gastrocnemius muscle were excised for microscopic examination. Muscle samples were also evaluated in terms of malondialdehyde ( MDA) , glutathione , and chemiluminescence ( CL) levels. Results: In tadalafil-treated AA rats , metatarsophalangeal joints revealed regular morphology of the cartilage with slight destruction and less inflammatory cell infiltration and vascularization in comparison to the controls ( microscopic score: 1.17 ± 0.31 vs. 4.17 ± 0.79; P < 0.01). AA rats presented increased gastrocnemius muscle MDA , glutathione , and CL levels compared to the controls ( P < 0.01 , for MDA; P < 0.05 , for glutathione; P < 0.05 for CL). Tadalafil attenuated the increase in CL levels ( P < 0.01 , for luminol and P < 0.001 , for lucigenin). Serum TOS showed significant reductions by tadalafil. Conclusion: The long-acting PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil provides partial protection in a rat model of CFA-induced arthritis<disease> possibly via suppression of oxidant generation.
