  A glucose biosensor was utilized as a platform for the time-temperature integrator ( TTI) , a device for intelligent food packaging. The TTI system is composed of glucose oxidase , glucose , a pH indicator , and a three-electrode potentiostat , which produces an electrical signal as well as color development. The reaction kinetics of these response variables were analyzed under isothermal conditions. The reaction rates of the electrical current and color<symptom> changes<symptom> were 0.0360 ± 0.0020 ( 95 % confidence limit) , 0.0566 ± 0.0026 , 0.0716 ± 0.0024 , 0.1073 ± 0.0028 & micro; A/min , and 0.0187 ± 0.0005 , 0.0293 ± 0.0018 , 0.0363 ± 0.0012 , 0.0540 ± 0.0019 1/min , at 5 , 15 , 25 , and 35 & deg; C , respectively. The Arrhenius activation energy of the current reaction (
