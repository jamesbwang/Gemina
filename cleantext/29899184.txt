  We previously showed that nuclear DNA replication ( NDR) is regulated by a checkpoint monitoring the occurrence of organelle DNA replication ( ODR) in a unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae. These analyses depended on the use of chemical CDK inhibitors such as CDK2 inhibitor II and roscovitine , but subsequent analyses yielded conflicting results depending on the experimental conditions. In the present study , we identified significantly short half-lives of the used chemicals in the sulfur acidic cultivation medium , which reconciles the discrepancy among these results.
