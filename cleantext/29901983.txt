  Developing new electrocatalysts is essentially important for efficient water splitting to produce hydrogen. Two-dimensional ( 2D) materials provide great potential for high-performance electrocatalysts because of their high specific surface area , abundant active edges , and tunable electronic structure. Here , we report few-layer NiPS
