  To show and rationalize the confounding effects on the rotational/oscillatory rheology of surface active impurities in commercial protein formulations such as bovine serum albumin , BSA. Bulk and interfacial rotational/oscillatory rheology were used to study the viscosity , complex viscosity , storage/elastic modulus , G ' and loss/viscous modulus , G '' , as a function of time of aqueous formulations of BSA and their purified components. Viscosity/time profiles at steady shear for different commercial BSA products and lots showed viscosity increase , decrease and time-independent profiles at low shear rates. All lots showed shear thinning. BSA monomer and dimers/aggregates , in general , showed similar profiles. Addition of low levels of surfactant or high shear rates rendered all solutions to be Newtonian-like. Interfacial viscosity studies paralleled those on the rotational rheometer. G ' > G '' with viscosity increase and G ' < G '' with viscosity decrease over time. We provide a rational explanation for the time-dependent and source-dependent rheological behavior of aqueous formulations of commercially available BSA proteins based on the migration of protein and surface active impurities to the air/water interface within the rheometer plates leading to the formation and breakdown of protein networks. Highly purified proteins is warranted in rheological studies of protein drug product candidates.
