  Evaluate the reliability of sentinel node biopsy ( SNB) in T1/T2 cN0 oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC) , and compare recurrence-free time ( RFT) and overall survival ( OS) between patients undergoing SNB and neck dissection ( ND). Patients with T1/T2 cN0 OSCC underwent SNB followed by systematic ND in the first cohort and SNB followed by selective ND in case of positive sentinel nodes ( SN) in the second cohort. A total of 229 patients were followed ( first cohort 50 , second cohort 179). SNs were successfully detected in 93.9 % ( 215/229) of cases. Median follow-up was 5.6 years. Recurrence occurred in 38/215 patients , with isolated nodal recurrence in 18/215 patients. At 5 years , the rate of recurrence-free patients was 80.0 % and the rate of patients without isolated nodal recurrence was 90.4 %. Negative predictive value of SNB was 92.7 %. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding RFT and OS. In 83 % ( 10/12) of ipsilateral isolated nodal recurrences , primary tumor was located in anterior part of oral cavity. Only 43 % ( 3/7) of SN + patients with nodal recurrence were eligible for salvage surgery , compared to 91 % ( 10/11) of SN- patients. SNB resulted in fewer complications than ND ( 8 % vs 28 % , p < 0.0001). SNB is a reliable staging tool for T1/T2 cN0 OSCC , without adverse effect on patient survival and fewer complications. No late recurrences occurred in long-term follow-up. Close follow-up is mandatory for SN + patients , who are at higher risk of nodal recurrence and have worse prognosis.
