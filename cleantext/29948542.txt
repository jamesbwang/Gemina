  Patients with chronic physical symptoms ( e.g. , chronic<symptom> pain<symptom>) often have significant functional impairment ( i.e. , disability). The fear avoidance model is the dominant theoretical model of how the relationship between chronic physical symptoms and functional impairment develops and proposes a cyclical/bidirectional relationship. There has never been a definitive test of the proposed bi-directional relationship. The current study followed 767 Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom soldiers from pre-deployment , when they were relatively healthy , to 1 year after deployment , when it was anticipated that symptoms would increase or develop. Over the four assessment time points , physical symptom severity consistently predicted worse functional impairment at the subsequent time point. Functional impairment did not show a consistent relationship with worsening of physical symptom severity. These findings suggest that changes to functional impairment do not have a short-term impact on physical symptom severity.
