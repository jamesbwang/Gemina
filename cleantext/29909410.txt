  Soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator- ( suPAR) is an inflammatory signal with pleiotropic biological effects depending on context and post-translational modifications. Recently , ( Hayek , et al: Nat Med 2017; 23: 945-953) it has been found that there is a link between suPAR and renal disease in several guises , and a key question is whether it is a driver or a marker of renal disease , and if so of which types of kidney damage. Subject of Review: Circulating suPAR has been postulated to cause acute proteinuric kidney disease , specifically focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS) , though both the animal models and clinical data in the original reports have been challenged. More recently , suPAR levels are linked to the risk of progression of chronic kidney disease ( CKD) by directly activating signaling pathways in the podocyte or as a sensitive early biomarker. Second Opinion: The evidence for suPAR as a driver of FSGS proteinuria<symptom> is not yet established , and more needs to be done , particularly by measuring different circulating suPAR fragments and identifying `` second hits , '' to clarify if any role exists. The evidence for suPAR as a sensitive biomarker for CKD progression is currently stronger , and needs further independent validation as well as prospective serial suPAR measurements in CKD cohorts. Whether it is a surrogate marker for ongoing inflammatory drivers of kidney disease , or has direct mechanistic effects in podocytes will depend on further studies , as well as trials of suPAR removal or direct blockade of downstream pathways.
