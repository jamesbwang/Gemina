  The emergence of infections associated to new antimicrobial resistance in Acinetobacter<pathogen> baumannii<pathogen> ( Ab) genotypes represents a major challenge. In this context , this study aimed to determine the diversity of resistance mechanisms and investigate clonal dissemination and predominant sequence types ( STs) in multidrug-resistant Ab strains of clinical ( tracheal aspirate , n = 17) and environmental ( surface , n = 6) origins. Additionally , the major clones found in clinical ( A) and environmental ( H) strains had their complete genomes sequenced. All strains were submitted to polymerase chain reactions ( PCR) for the detection of the ISAba1/blaOXA -51-like and ISAba1/blaOXA -23-like genes , while the expression of genes encoding the carO porin , AdeABC ( adeB) , AdeFGH ( adeG) , and AdeIJK ( adeJ) efflux pumps was determined by real time PCR ( qPCR). Most of the strains were characterized as extensively drug-resistant ( XDR) with high minimal inhibitory concentrations ( MICs) detected for tigecycline and carbapenems. Associations between ISAba1/OXA -51 and ISAba1/OXA -23 were observed in 91.3 % and 52.2 % of the strains , respectively. Only the adeB gene was considered hyper-expressed. Furthermore , most of the strains analyzed by the MuLtilocus Sequence-Typing ( MLST) were found to belong to the clonal complex 113 ( CC113). In addition , a new ST , ST1399 , belonging to CC229 , was also discovered herein. Strains analyzed by whole genome sequencing presented resistance genes linked to multidrug-resistance phenotypes and confirmed the presence of Tn2008 , which provides high levels carbapenem-resistance.
