  Symptoms of depression<symptom> negatively impact on mother-infant relationships and child outcomes. We evaluated a novel , 10-session mother-infant therapeutic playgroup-Community HUGS ( CHUGS)- which combines cognitive and experiential components through psychoeducation , play , music , and movement. Participants were mothers experiencing a range of postnatal mental health difficulties , including depression<symptom> , with infants â‰¤ 12 months of age. However , the aim was not to treat maternal depression<symptom> but to ameliorate associated problems in the mother-infant interaction. In the feasibility study , all participants received CHUGS. In the pilot randomized controlled trial ( RCT) , participants were randomized between intervention and a wait-list. Outcomes were the Parenting Stress Index ( PSI; R.R. Abidin , 1995) , Parenting Sense of Competency Scale ( Self-Efficacy subscale; J. Gibaud-Wallston & L.P. Wandersman , 1978) , and the Depression<symptom> , Anxiety<symptom> , Stress Scales ( P.F. Lovibond & S.H. Lovibond , 1995). In the feasibility study ( n = 74) , PSI scores dropped on all subscales , all ps < .01. Depression<symptom> , p < .001 , anxiety<symptom> , p = .01 , stress , p = .01 , and self-efficacy , p < .001 , all showed improvements , as did observer-rated mother-infant interactions , p < .001. In the RCT , depression<symptom> , p < .001 , anxiety<symptom> , p = .005 , and stress , p < .001 , symptoms were significantly reduced for intervention participants ( n = 16) , as compared to wait-list participants ( n = 15). The CHUGS program had high participant satisfaction and produced improvements in self-efficacy , depression<symptom> , anxiety<symptom> , stress , and mother-infant interactions that supported the program 's acceptability and the utility of further rollout.
