  Diagnosis-related groups ( DRGs) have been receiving increasing attention in health service research in China. In the present study , we used the 2014 Beijing-Diagnosis Related Groups ( BJ-DRGs) to evaluate the inpatient service performance of the clinical subspecialty `` major operation of the digestive system '' of a cancer specialist hospital.The research hospital is one of 16 public municipal hospitals overseen by the Beijing Health Bureau ( `` 16 hospitals ''). Discharge data collected between 2008 and 2015 were drawn from the front pages of the medical records of these hospitals. After the data were reported to the Beijing Public Health Information Centre , as well as being grouped using the BJ-DRGs. We evaluated the service performance of this subspecialty in terms of capacity , efficiency , and service quality , based on the BJ-DRGs risk adjustment tool.From 2008 to 2015 , the total weight of the subspecialty in the research hospital increased annually. In 2015 , the cases in this hospital accounted for 50.27 % of the total in 16 hospitals. The time consumption index was 0.91 , whereas the charge consumption index was 1.24 , which was 24 % higher than the average in16 hospitals. The mortality rates of the middle-low risk groups ( GB15 and GB25) in the research hospital and the 16 hospitals were zero , while the mortality rates for the middle-high risk groups ( GB11 and GB23) in the research hospital were significantly lower than those in 16 hospitals.The service capacity of the subspecialty steadily increased in the research hospital. However , the hospital must offer more attention to complex digestive disease cases ( GB11/GB23) and strictly control hospitalization expenses , while maintaining the advantages of service efficiency and quality.
