  Members of the fibroblast growth factor ( FGF) family are involved in a variety of cellular processes. In the nervous system , they affect the differentiation and migration of neurons , the formation and maturation of synapses , and the repair of neuronal circuits following insults. Because of the varied yet critical functions of FGF ligands , their availability and activity must be tightly regulated for the nervous system , as well as other tissues , to properly develop and function in adulthood. In this regard , FGF binding proteins ( FGFBPs) have emerged as strong candidates for modulating the actions of secreted FGFs in neural and non-neural tissues. Here , we will review the roles of FGFBPs in the peripheral and central nervous systems.
