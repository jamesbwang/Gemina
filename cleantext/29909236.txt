  Inflammatory<symptom> pain<symptom> is the most common type of pain that is treated clinically. The use of currently available treatments ( classic analgesics- NSAIDs , paracetamol and opioids) is limited by insufficient efficacy and/or side effects/tolerance development. Antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs) are widely used in neuropathic pain treatment , but there is substantial preclinical evidence on their efficacy against inflammatory<symptom> pain<symptom> , too. In this review we focus on gabapentinoids ( gabapentin and pregabalin) and dibenzazepine AEDs ( carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine , and recently introduced eslicarbazepine acetate) and their potential for relieving inflammatory<symptom> pain<symptom>. In models of somatic , visceral and trigeminal inflammatory<symptom> pain<symptom> , that have a translational value for inflammatory conditions in locomotor system , viscera and head/face , AEDs have demonstrated analgesic activity. This activity was mostly consistent , dependent on the dose and largely independent on the site of inflammation<symptom> and method of its induction , nociceptive stimuli , species , specific drug used , its route of administration and dosing schedule. AEDs exerted comparable efficacy with classic analgesics. Effective doses of AEDs are lower than toxic doses in animals and , when expressed as equivalent human doses , they are largely overlapping with AEDs doses already used in humans for treating epilepsy/neuropathic pain. The main mechanism of antinociceptive/antihyperalgesic action of gabapentinoids in inflammatory<symptom> pain<symptom> models seems to be Î±
