  This is the first study investigating the chemical composition of essential oils ( EOs) isolated from different tissues of Carissa macrocarpa ( Eckl.) A.DC , their antimicrobial activity and the anatomical characters of the aerial organs and the fruits. The main EO components were pentadecanal and tetradecan-1-ol ( 31.9 and 16.5 % in fresh leaf EO , resp.) , ( E)- nerolidol and caryophyllene oxide ( 27.3 and 15.0 % in fruit EO , resp.) , linalool and hexahydrofarnesyl acetone ( 30.9 and 24.9 % in stem EO , resp.) , benzyl benzoate ( 24.3 % in flower EO). The fruit EO was more active against Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> ( MIC = 0.46 mg/mL) compared to the reference antibiotic ( 17.66 mg/mL). Furthermore , at this concentration it inhibited all the Gram-positive bacteria. Concerning the anatomical features , it is noteworth the presence of a large cluster of Ca oxalate crystals inside some parenchymatous cells. Large ducts corresponding to non articulated laticifers were identified in the cortex of leaf , stem and fruit pericarp. The laticifers categories and their distribution are taxonomically important to discriminate this species from others acclimated in different countries. Considering the obtained results , EOs of C. macrocarpa can be a good source of antimicrobial compounds , contributing to solve the problem of microbial resistance to antibiotics.
