  Functional genomics networks are widely used to identify unexpected pathway relationships in large genomic datasets. However , it is challenging to compare the signal-to-noise ratios of different networks and to identify the optimal network with which to interpret a particular genetic dataset. We present GeNets , a platform in which users can train a machine-learning model ( Quack) to carry out these comparisons and execute , store , and share analyses of genetic and RNA-sequencing datasets.
