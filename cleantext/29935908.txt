  The aim of the study was to identify the knowledge and attitudes of parents about epilepsy. Our study was conducted as a questionnaire study with 1200 parents. The demographic information of the participants , their answers to general questions about epilepsy , and their self-reported epilepsy knowledge scale and epilepsy attitude scale data were evaluated. A total of 746 ( 62.2 %) mothers and 454 ( 37.8 %) fathers participated in the study. The mean age was 36.3 Â± 9.2 years. The educational level was high school or higher in 65.3 %. The mothers and the fathers had similar epilepsy knowledge levels and epilepsy attitude characteristics. The highest epilepsy knowledge level and the best attitudes about epilepsy according to the educational level was in the `` university or higher '' group. Moreover , a positive correlation was found between the epilepsy knowledge level and positive epilepsy attitudes of the parents. A more positive attitude and better knowledge about epilepsy with increasing educational level indicate that negative attitudes are caused by lack of information. Positive attitudes in the society toward patients with epilepsy would be expected to increase by ensuring a sufficient level of knowledge about epilepsy.
