  Oncogenic Kras mutations are one of the most common alterations in non-small cell lung cancer and are associated with poor<symptom> response<symptom> to treatment and reduced survival. Driver oncogenes , such as Kras are now appreciated for their ability to promote tumor growth via up-regulation of anabolic pathways. Therefore , we wanted to identify metabolic vulnerabilities in Kras-mutant lung cancer. Using the Kras
