  Oxidative stress and inflammation<symptom> contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) , and the control of lipid status by statins may help to stop the progression of NAFLD. We hypothesized that the addition of antioxidant vitamins C and E to atorvastatin therapy is associated with improved serum enzyme antioxidant status. NAFLD-related serum parameters and the activity of antioxidant enzymes , before and after 3 months of treatment , were determined in patients receiving atorvastatin alone or atorvastatin plus antioxidants. Compared to healthy controls , the patients , before receiving therapy , had increased catalase and glutathione reductase , with no significant difference in glutathione peroxidase activity. After the treatment , the levels of all three antioxidant markers were reduced to the same degree in both groups of patients , indicating therapy-induced lower level of reactive oxygen species production and/or improved nonenzymatic antioxidant mechanisms. Both therapies led to the normalization of the serum lipid profile and aminotransferase levels in the patients , but the reduction in CRP , although significant , did not reduce levels to those of the controls. The obtained results favor the notion that therapy with atorvastatin alone is equally efficient during the early stages of NAFLD , regardless of the addition of antioxidant vitamins. This trial is registered with TCTR20180425001.
