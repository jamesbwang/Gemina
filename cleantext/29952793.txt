  The aim of this study was to identify lessons learned from partnerships addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic that can inform those needed to mitigate the noncommunicable diseases ( NCDs) epidemic in low and middle-income countries ( LMICs). We selected and analysed a convenience sample of organizational partnerships developed to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in LMICs , focusing on their specific strategies and contributions. A review of published literature and website information pertaining to a convenience sample of five global organizations and/or types of partnerships that provide support to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic was qualitatively analysed to assess key areas of support provided to scale-up services in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Six topical areas of support were identified: HIV/AIDS service delivery; enhancing comprehensive health systems capacity; operational and implementation science research to improve care delivery; introducing and improving the availability of new products; political advocacy; and early-stage planning for sustainability and transition to more independent implementing-country delivery programmes. These six areas of support were qualitatively assessed for identify a focus , contributory or minimal contribution on the part of each of the organizations and/or types of partnerships reviewed. No single global partnership addresses the range of support needed to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic , and this will likely be true for an effective response to the emerging NCD epidemic. A range of coordinated financial and/or technical support as well as lessons learned from global HIV/AIDS partnerships will be key to achieving an effective response to the global NCD epidemic.
