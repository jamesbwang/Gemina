  Involving persons with spinal cord injury ( SCI) as experts in their lives is important for research to design relevant health care interventions. The purpose of this study was to use photovoice methods to explore experiences of barriers and possibilities in return to work among working adults with SCI. The photovoice group consisted of six persons living with SCI that met weekly over 2 months to share and discuss photos related to return to work. Five themes were identified: ( a) there is only one way , ( b) welcome back-or not , ( c) to be like anyone else-or to be perceived as someone else , ( d) friction in the absence of clarity , and ( e) finding integrated strategies for everyday life with work. Work was experienced as rewarding and viable , but due to lack of societal and workplace support , a need to map out one 's own paths toward work was identified.
