  Cancer is estimated to be a significant health problem of the 21st century. The situation gets even tougher when it comes to its treatment using chemotherapy employing synthetic anticancer molecules with numerous side effects. Recently , there has been a paradigm shift toward the adoption of herbal drugs for the treatment of cancer. In this context , a suitable delivery system is principally warranted to deliver these herbal biomolecules specifically at the tumorous site. To achieve this goal , carbon nanotubes ( CNTs) have been widely explored to deliver anticancer herbal molecules with improved therapeutic efficacy and safety. This review uniquely expounds the biopharmaceutical , clinical and safety aspects of different anticancer herbal drugs delivered through CNTs with a cross-talk on their outcomes. This review will serve as a one-stop-shop for the readers on various anticancer herbal drugs delivered through CNTs as a futuristic delivery device.
