  Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) is emerging as a synaptopathology driven by metaplasticity. Indeed , reminiscent of metaplasticity , oligomeric forms of the amyloid-β peptide ( oAβ) prevent induction of long-term potentiation ( LTP) via the prior activation of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors ( NMDARs). However , the downstream Ca
