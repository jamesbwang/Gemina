  A promising strategy for preventing illness and death caused by Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> ( Mtb) is vaccination. In this study , we aimed to evaluate the capacity of a multicomponent vaccine comprising HspX/EsxS-fused protein , PLGA ( poly ( lactide-co-glycolide)) and DOTAP ( 1 , 2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane) in eliciting immune responses against Mtb in BALB/c mice. A preparation of PLGA nanoparticles ( NPs) containing fused protein and DOTAP adjuvant was made using double emulsion solvent evaporation ( w/o/w) and lipid film hydration methods , respectively. After three subcutaneous immunization of BALB/c mice with various formulations , ELISA technique was used to measure interferon-γ ( IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 ( IL-4) cytokines levels in splenocytes as well as serum anti-HspX/EsxS IgG1 and IgG2a titers. The results of the current study showed that PLGA/HspX/EsxS/ DOTAP formulation was able to induce higher levels of FN-γ , IgG1 , and IgG2a responses compared with BCG as the positive control , HspX/EsxS , HspX/EsxS/DOTAP and PLGA/HspX/EsxS formulations. Our results suggest that PLGA NPs , as delivery system , and DOTAP , as adjuvant , have a good potential to enhance immune responses against HspX/EsxS antigen after subcutaneous immunization of BALB/c mice.
