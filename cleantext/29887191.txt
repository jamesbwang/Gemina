  We analyzed the effect of insurance expansion on emergency department ( ED) utilization among the uninsured in Maryland , which expanded Medicaid eligibility and created health insurance exchanges in 2014. This was a retrospective analysis of statewide administrative claims for July 2012 to December 2015. We used coarsened exact matching to pair uninsured and insured ( Medicaid , Medicare , commercial , and other) adult Maryland residents who visited an ED or were hospitalized at baseline ( July 2012 to December 2013). We compared ED utilization between these groups after insurance expansion ( January 2014 to December 2015) , using a difference-in-differences quasi-experimental design. Nonreturning patients from the baseline period were included in the post-insurance expansion rates as having zero visits. Matching yielded 178,381 pairs. In the 12 months before insurance expansion , the baseline uninsured group visited the ED at a rate of 26.1 per 100 patient-quarters versus 28.2 among the insured group ( relative rate = 0.93). In the 24 months after insurance expansion , 45 % of the baseline uninsured returned to an ED , of whom 33 % returned uninsured , 40 % returned with Medicaid , and 21 % returned with commercial insurance. After insurance expansion , with 55 % of patients in each group not returning , the ED visit rate for both the baseline uninsured and insured groups was 15.9 per 100 patient-quarters ( relative rate = 1.00). This 8 % relative increase from baseline in ED visits among the uninsured group was driven primarily by increases in higher-acuity visits. Uninsured patients from high-poverty zip codes ( N = 34,964 pairs) increased their ED utilization by 15 % after insurance expansion , whereas baseline uninsured patients with no comorbidities ( N = 94,330 pairs) showed a 3 % decrease. Insurance expansion in Maryland was associated with a modest relative increase in ED visits among the uninsured , driven by increases in higher-acuity visits. It remains unclear whether insurance coverage helped the uninsured address their unmet medical needs.
