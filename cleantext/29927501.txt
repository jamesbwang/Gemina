  Cushing disease ( CD) is a rare entity caused by ACTH-secreting pituitary tumours , leading to prolonged hypercortisolism. Most cases are sporadic but can rarely occur in the context of familial predisposition , due to germline mutations in genes such as MEN1 , leading to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 , MEN1. We have reported previously that CD can be the first and only presenting manifestation of MEN1. In this report , we describe a cohort of paediatric patients who presented with CD as the first manifestation of MEN1. A retrospective analysis of paediatric patients admitted to the National Institutes of Health ( NIH) Clinical Center for evaluation of hypercortisolism , between 1997 and 2017. MEN1 was diagnosed on a clinical , familial and/or genetic basis. Of a total of 238 children with CD , six patients were subsequently diagnosed with MEN1 , three males and three females with a mean age at diagnosis of CD at 13.4 Â± 2.9 years. Five of the six patients had familial MEN1 and one patient was a sporadic case. Additional manifestations of MEN1 included primary hyperparathyroidism in three patients and hyperprolactinemia in two patients. This report describes a paediatric patient population with MEN1 in whom CD was the initial manifestation , confirming a previous observation that paediatric patients with MEN1 may present first with an ACTH-producing adenoma. Therefore , germline MEN1 mutations should be sought in paediatric CD and tested for when there is a suggestive family history and/or other manifestations.
