  Mining and other industrial activities worldwide have resulted in Se-enriched surface soils , which pose risks to human and environmental health. Although not well studied , microbial activity can alter Se bioavailability and distribution , even in oxic environments. We used high throughput sequencing to profile bacterial and fungal communities inhabiting mine soils in southeastern Idaho , comparing mined and unmined locations within two reclaimed phosphate mine areas containing variable Se concentrations. The goal was to determine whether microbial communities differed in ( i) different mines , ( ii) mined areas compared to unmined areas , and ( iii) varying soil Se concentrations. Though reclamation occurred 20-30 years ago , microbial community structures in mined soils were significantly altered compared to unmined soils , suggesting persistent mining-related impacts on soil processes.
