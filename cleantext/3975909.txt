  Cadmium ( Cd) is an environmental contaminant that damages the kidney , the liver , and bones. Some epidemiological studies showed associations between Cd exposure and periodontal<disease> disease<disease> The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between Cd exposure and periodontal<disease> disease<disease> in experimental animals. Male Sprague/Dawley rats were given daily subcutaneous injections of Cd ( 0.6 mg/kg/day) for up to 12 weeks. The animals were euthanized , and their mandibles and maxillae were evaluated for levels of periodontal bone by measuring the distance from the cementoenamel junction ( CEJ) to the alveolar bone crest ( ABC) of the molar roots. After 12 weeks of Cd exposure in animals , there was a significantly greater distance between the CEJ and ABC in the palatal aspect of the maxillary molars and the lingual aspect of the mandibular molars when compared with controls (
