  Fiber-shaped supercapacitors with improved specific capacitance and high rate capability are a promising candidate as power supply for smart textiles. However , the synergistic interaction between conductive filaments and active nanomaterials remains a crucial challenge , especially when hydrothermal or electrochemical deposition is used to produce a core ( fiber)- shell ( active materials) fibrous structure. On the other hand , although 2D pseudocapacitive materials , e.g. , Ti
