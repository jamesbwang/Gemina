  In the current study , the effect of glucosamine methyl ester on cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis rat model was investigated. Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into 5 groups of 8 animals each. Osteoarthritis was induced in 4 groups using medial parapatellar incision followed by anterior cruciate ligament transection and meniscectomy. Normal and model osteoarthritis groups were given normal saline. The three treatment groups received 2 , 5 and 10 mg/kg doses of glucosamine methyl ester daily for one month. Microscopic examination of the knee cartilage showed a significant reduction in degeneration score in the treatment groups. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed inhibition of interleukin-1Î² expression and nitric oxide generation on treatment with glucosamine methyl ester. Expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-3 and -13 in the treatment groups were significantly lower compared to the model osteoarthritis group. Polymerase chain reaction revealed an increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 on treatment of rats with glucosamine methyl ester. In the osteoarthritis rats treated with various doses of glucosamine methyl ester staining , the level of toluidine blue and Masson 's trichrome increased. In addition , the level of type II collagen was also higher in the rats of treatment group. The level of proteoglycan , collagen and type II collagen in OA rats treated with 10 mg/kg doses was ~ 3.2- ( p < 0.01) , 2.4- ( p < 0.02) , and 3.6- ( p < 0.05) fold , respectively higher compared to the untreated animals. Glucosamine methyl ester , therefore , prevents degeneration of cartilage in osteoarthritis rats. It exhibits its effect by promoting proteoglycan , collagen , type II collagen , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 , and decreasing matrix metalloproteinase. Therefore , glucosamine methyl ester exhibits therapeutic effect against osteoarthritis.
