  Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of different urban structures on landscape connectivity , and most of them rely on the comparison approach or ex-ante scenario analysis. However , we still lack an ex-post method to capture the consequences of accomplished urban structure shift ( from monocentric to polycentric) , which is guided by the land use planning. To fill this gap , we develop an ex-post evaluation approach which integrates counterfactual analysis and landscape graphs. Counterfactual analysis is combined with cellular automata simulation model , to uncover what the city might look like , if it had continued to expand in a monocentric structure; and the landscape graphs enable us to reveal the possible landscape connectivity in actual and counterfactual scenarios. We select Nanjing city as the study area and 4 target species , to delve into the varying impacts of the urban structure shift on different taxonomic groups. Our case study demonstrates that: ( 1) the impact of urban structure shift is more relevant to the long disperser; ( 2) the actual landscape ( polycentric) would facilitate the bird 's dispersal , while ( 3) forest<disease> mammals have higher connectivity in the counterfactual scenario ( monocentric) , and the possible reasons are discussed. Finally , we demonstrate that the urban structure shift might not necessarily cause the connectivity decline , on condition that the key connectivity providers are identified by integrating ecological network analysis into the land use planning , and well preserved in the shift.
