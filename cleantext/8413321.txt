  Antibodies are useful tools for detecting individual proteins in complex samples and for learning about their location , amount , binding partners , and function in cells. Unfortunately , generating antibodies is time consuming and laborious , and their affinity and/or specificity is often limited. This protocol offers a fast and inexpensive alternative to generate antibody surrogates through phage display of a library of fibronectin type III ( FN3) monobody variants and affinity selection for binders.
