  Micrurus venoms are known to induce mainly neurotoxicity in victims. However , other manifestations , including hemorrhage<symptom> , edema<symptom> , myotoxicity , complement activation , and hemostatic activity have been reported. In order to develop a more complete pharmacological profile of these venoms , inflammatory responses and hemostasis were evaluated in C57BL/6 mice treated with a sub-lethal dose of M. t. tener ( Mtt) venom ( 8 μg/mouse) , inoculated intraperitoneally. The venom induced moderate bleeding into the abdominal cavity and lungs , as well as infiltration of leukocytes into the liver. After 30 min , the release of pro-inflammatory mediators ( TNF-α , IL-6 , and NO) were observed , being most evident at 4 h. There was a decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels at 72 h , a prolongation in coagulation times ( PT and aPTT) , a decrease in the fibrinogen concentration and an increase in fibrinolytic activity. In this animal model , it was proposed that Mtt venom induces inflammation<symptom> with the release of mediators such as TNF-α , in response to the toxins. These mediators may activate hemostatic mechanisms , producing systemic fibrinolysis and hemorrhage<symptom>. These findings suggest alternative treatments in Micrurus envenomations in which neurotoxic manifestations do not predominate.
