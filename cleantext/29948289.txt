  The procedural success of cardiovascular and structural interventions depends on adequate pre- and intraprocedural imaging. Multimodal imaging utilizing several techniques provides added value in terms of procedural planning and efficacy by combining the individual strength of each imaging modalities. Recently , fusion imaging as combined `` hybrid '' procedure of several imaging modalities has gained some attention. The major advantage consists in the optimized multi-dimensional view with an excellent spatial resolution and anatomic orientation. The so often called `` anatomical intelligence '' already gives prospects towards heart model-derived heart valve construction and individual anatomic conformation. However , hybrid fusion imaging has the potential to increase safety , accuracy , and procedural effectiveness in interventional cardiology.This review gives an overview of the benefits and shortcomings of multimodal and fusion imaging in the context of pre- and intraprocedural structural and cardiovascular interventions. It highlights some aspects and thoughts towards cardiovascular imaging of the future.
