  To determine the degree of influence of the confounders on the outcome of ischemic stroke ( IS). One hundred and eight patients were included in the prospective clinical cohort study. Based on disease outcomes , two groups of patients were singled out: 1st group- survivors ( n = 93) , 2nd group- patients with fatal outcomes ( n = 15). Concomitant diseases were found in 80 ( 74.1 %) patients. Twenty-eight ( 25.9 %) patients had no concomitant pathology ( without taking into account atherosclerosis , arterial hypertension , diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease). The Pearson Ï‡ Therefore , the presence or absence of confounders noted in patients of our cohort does not affect the likelihood of a favorable or fatal outcome.
