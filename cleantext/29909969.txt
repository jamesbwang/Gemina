  Sex impacts on liver physiology with severe consequences for energy metabolism and response to xenobiotic , hepatic , and extra-hepatic diseases. The comprehension of the biology subtending sex-related hepatic differences is therefore very relevant in the medical , pharmacological , and dietary perspective. The extensive application of metabolomics paired to transcriptomics here shows that , in the case of short-term fasting , the decision to maintain lipid synthesis using amino acids ( aa) as a source of fuel is the key discriminant for the hepatic metabolism of male and female mice. Pharmacological and genetic interventions indicate that the hepatic estrogen receptor ( ERÎ±) has a key role in this sex-related strategy that is primed around birth by the aromatase-dependent conversion of testosterone into estradiol. This energy partition strategy , possibly the result of an evolutionary pressure enabling mammals to tailor their reproductive capacities to nutritional status , is most important to direct future sex-specific dietary and medical interventions.
