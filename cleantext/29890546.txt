  Diabetes mellitus ( DM) is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease ( CAD) , and the complications of CAD are the leading cause of deaths among people with DM. Herein , this study aims to identify the common genes and pathways between diabetes and myocardial infarction ( MI) to provide more clues for the related mechanism studies. Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) were identified using the cutoff ( | log2 ( fold change) | > 0.45 and P value < 0.05) by the analysis of online datasets ( GSE9006 and GSE48060) related to DM and MI respectively. Moreover , the overlapped DEGs between DM and MI were identified , followed by enriched Gene Ontology ( GO) and Kyoto<pathogen> Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG) pathway analysis. And the independent patient RNA samples were collected for qRT-PCR validation of the mRNA expression of these overlapped genes. PI3 , ACSL1 , MMD and MMP were altered in both T1DM and MI , and they were highly related to `` regulation of cellular protein metabolic process ''. Meanwhile , six genes were identified in both T2DM and MI , which are ADM , NFIL3 , PI3 , SLPI , ACSL1 and MMP9 and significantly related to `` negative regulation of endopeptidase activity ''. And the expression of these genes were validated. In summary , we identified the common DEGs and pathways between T1DM or T2DM and MI , and further validated the changes of those DEGs , providing some clues for mechanism study and potentially therapeutic targets.
