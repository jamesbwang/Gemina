  The inappropriate and surfeit use of antibiotics have generated a hunt for safe and alternative antimicrobial agents against pathogenic bacteria. With the advancement in nanoscience and nanotechnology , promising opportunities for examining the bacterial effect of metal nanoparticles were demonstrated in literature. Focusing on this , our present study presentssynthesis of l-ascorbic coated gadolinium oxide nanoparticles via a simple precipitation route. Their complete characterization and detailed stability studies were carried out. The obtained nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared ( FT-IR) spectroscopy , confirming that l-ascorbic acid onto the surface of nanoparticles. The size and morphology were analyzed by Transmission electron Microcopy ( TEM) and Field emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE-SEM) which reveals their spherical nature. The stability studies were performed to know about their chemical and colloidal stability. The synthesized nanoparticles were found to be non-toxic to HaCaT cells upto the concentration of 125 Âµg/mL. The antimicrobial effect of nanoparticles was analyzed against three bacterial strains; E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> , S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> and S.<pathogen> typhimurium<pathogen>. To summarize , the synthesized nanoparticles are found to be safe and protective against pathogenic bacteria. They further can be explored in biomedical applications considering their non-toxic nature.
