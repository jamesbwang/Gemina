  The dimensional pathological personality trait model proposed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition ( DSM-5) , Section III Criterion B , has shown promising results for its validity and utility in conceptualizing personality pathology. However , as its structural equivalence across sex is yet to be tested , the validity for the model across males and females remains uncertain. In the present article , we examined sex measurement invariance of the DSM-5 trait model in a large undergraduate sample using the Personality Inventory for DSM-5. A series of confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses suggested that , although the exact facet-domain relationships as specified in the DSM-5 were not observed , the facets generally organize into a model with five latent factors similar to those listed in the DSM-5 Section III Criterion B. Further , these five factors were fully measurement invariant across sex at the configural , metric , and scalar levels. Examination of the latent trait mean levels suggests that females tend to have higher scores on latent Negative Affectivity , whereas males tend to have higher scores on latent Antagonism , Detachment , Psychoticism , and Disinhibition. These results indicate that the DSM-5 Section III pathological personality trait model is fully structurally equivalent across sex , a property that is lacking in the traditional categorical model in Section II. This further validates the use of the dimensional DSM-5 trait model for personality disorder assessment and conceptualization in both research and clinical settings. ( PsycINFO Database Record
