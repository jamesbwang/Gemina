  Vertical integration of the broiler industry allows producers to combine different biosecurity and sanitation practices , housing technologies , and feeding regimens to improve food safety. The objectives of this study were to determine the antimicrobial resistance pattern of β-lactamase-producing E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and to compare the characteristics of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> recovered from 7 different integrated broiler operations in South Korea. Among 200 chicken meat samples , 101 were observed to be positive for E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. However , the prevalence varied from 37.5 % to 75.0 % in chicken meats from different operations , indicating variation in E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> occurrence among the operations. Among 101 isolated E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> from chicken meat , 59 were identified third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and recovered from 7 different operations. A high proportion of the E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates were resistant to penicillins ( 89.8 %) , quinolones ( 81.4 %). Among 59 third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates , 29 showed phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of β-lactamase-producing E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. Prevalence of bla gene , blaCTX-M-1 , blaCTX-M-14 , blaCMY-2 , and blaTEM-1 , were identified in 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates respectively and only one E coli had both genes , blaTEM-1 and blaCTX-M-1. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE) analysis was performed on 29 β-lactamase-producing E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates. In PFGE , E coli included 7 PFGE patterns showing the same operation and an accorded both resistance to β-lactam antibiotics and presence of the bla-gene. Our findings suggest that E coli with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins can now be found in association with integrated broiler operations , providing the data to support the development of monitoring and preventing program in integrated operations.
