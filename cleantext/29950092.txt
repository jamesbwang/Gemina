  Black phosphorus quantum dots ( BPQDs) as novel nanomaterials have many potential applications in biomedicine. However , the interaction of BPQDs with proteins and their biological effects and potential risks are still unclear. Here , mucin , which serves biologically as a physical barrier against foreign substances entering tissues , was chosen as a model substrate for studying the adsorption-desorption behavior of BPQDs using surface plasmon resonance sensing and a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring. We found that the surface modification of BPQDs with poly ( ethylene glycol)- amine ( PEG-NH
