  The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence and clinical correlates of aggression and violence in individuals presenting with first-episode psychosis ( FEP) and to evaluate whether this prevalence has changed in recent years when compared to a similar previous study. Retrospective cross-sectional study of clinical case notes and database records using a keyword search of a sample of patients with FEP ( n = 132) aged between 18 and 65 years presenting from a geographically defined catchment area to a secondary referral psychiatric service over a 4-year period ( 2010-2013 inclusive). Use of the Modified Overt Aggression Scale to retrospectively assess aggression and violence in the week prior to , and post , presentation with FEP. The overall proportion of individuals found to be aggressive and violent was 36 % and 29 % , respectively. These rates were similar to the 1995 to 1998 cohort ( ie , 33 % and 29 %). A higher percentage of our sample ( 22 %) was violent in the week prior to presentation compared to the 1995 to 1998 cohort ( 13 %). Aggression was independently associated with involuntary ( odds ratio ( OR) = 4.085 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 1.310-12.733) and inpatient treatment status ( OR = 0.109 , 95 % CI 0.023-0.532) in the week prior to presentation and with high activation ( OR = 6.770 , 95 % CI 1.372-33.394) and involuntary treatment status ( OR = 10.163 , 95 % CI 2.257-45.759) in the week following presentation. Violence was associated with involuntary ( OR = 3.691 , 95 % CI 1.197-11.382) and inpatient status ( OR = 0.096 , 95 % CI 0.020-0.465) in the week prior to and with high activation ( OR = 29.513 95 % CI 1.879-463.676) the week following presentation. Aggression and violence rates in FEP appear relatively stable over time.
