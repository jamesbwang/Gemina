  Complexity is much talked about but sub-optimally studied in health services research. Although the significance of the complex system as an analytic lens is increasingly recognised , many researchers are still using methods that assume a closed system in which predictive studies in general , and controlled experiments in particular , are possible and preferred. We argue that in open systems characterised by dynamically changing inter-relationships and tensions , conventional research designs predicated on linearity and predictability must be augmented by the study of how we can best deal with uncertainty , unpredictability and emergent causality. Accordingly , the study of complexity in health services and systems requires new standards of research quality , namely ( for example) rich theorising , generative learning , and pragmatic adaptation to changing contexts. This framing of complexity-informed health services research provides a backdrop for a new collection of empirical studies. Each of the initial five papers in this collection illustrates , in different ways , the value of theoretically grounded , methodologically pluralistic , flexible and adaptive study designs. We propose an agenda for future research and invite researchers to contribute to this on-going series.
