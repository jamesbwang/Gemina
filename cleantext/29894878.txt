  Biochar , produced through pyrolysis of organic matter , is negatively charged , thus contributing to electrostatic adsorption of cations. However , due to its porous structure and contents of alkaline ashes , the determination of the cation exchange capacity ( CEC) is challenging. Literature values for the CEC of biochar are surprisingly variable and are often poorly reproducible , suggesting methodological problems. Here , we modify and critically assess different steps in the existing ammonium acetate ( NH
