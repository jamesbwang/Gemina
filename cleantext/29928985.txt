  Roflumilast is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-4 isoenzyme in lung cells. Having psychiatric adverse reactions when administered orally affects negatively the patients ' adherence to the drug. This work aimed to prepare emulsified spray dried alginate microparticles for the pulmonary delivery of roflumilast. Sodium alginate was used as microparticle-forming material , isopropyl myristate as an oil , Tween ® 80 as surfactant and calcium beta-glycerophosphate as cross-linking agent to enhance the mechanical properties of the particles. The prepared particles were evaluated for their encapsulation efficiency , particle size and in-vitro drug release. From the studied carriers , beta-cyclodextrin ( CD) was the best regarding giving formulation with smaller particle size and more sustained drug release. The inhalation profile of CD-based microparticles was investigated using Anderson cascade impactor. The aerosolization profile of CD-based microparticles suggested their efficiency to deliver the drug deep in the lung. The CD-based microparticles possessed more inhibitory effects on the viability of A549 cells and on the pro-inflammatory cytokines ( TNF-α , IL-6 and IL-10) compared to the pure drug. Hence , CD-based microparticles could regulate the tumorigenesis besides tumor-associated inflammation<symptom>. Finally , CD-based microparticles showed more sustained bronchodilatation properties in healthy human volunteers when compared to Ventolin ® HFA. CD-based microparticles proved to be a promising carrier for inhaled roflumilast in human.
