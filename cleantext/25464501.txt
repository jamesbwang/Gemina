  miRNA-183 family , in normal biology , is expressed in a harmonious and stable manner in the neurosensory organs and cells. Studies have also shown that miRNA-183 family , in different pathways , affects the neurosensory development , maintenance , survival and function. In addition , it has potential neuroprotective effects in response to neurosensory destructive stimulations. miRNA-96 mutation causes hereditary deafness in humans and mice , and therefore affects the inner ear activity and its maintenance. Certain roles have been identified for miR-96 in the maintenance and function of the inner ear. The comparison of the target genes of family-183 in transcriptomes of newborn and adult hair cells shows that hundreds of target genes in this family may affect development and maintenance of the ears<disease>. Identifying the genes that are regulated by miRNA-183 family provides researchers with important information about the complex development and environmental regulation of the inner ear , and can offer new approaches to the maintenance and regeneration of hair cells and auditory nerve.
