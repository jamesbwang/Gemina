  Communications across chemical synapses are primarily mediated by neurotransmitters and their postsynaptic receptors. There are diverse molecular systems to localize and regulate the receptors at the synapse. Here , we identify HPO-30 , a member of the claudin superfamily of membrane proteins , as a positive regulator for synaptic localization of levamisole dependent acetylcholine receptors ( LAChRs) at the
