  BACKGROUND Minimizing the tacrolimus dosage in patients with stable allograft function needs further investigation. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed an open-label , randomized , controlled study from 2010 to 2016 in 7 tertiary teaching hospitals in Korea and enrolled 345 kidney transplant recipients with a stable graft status. The study group received reduced-dose tacrolimus , 1080-1440 mg/day of enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium ( EC-MPS) , and corticosteroids. The control group received the standard tacrolimus dosage and 540-720 mg/day of EC-MPS with steroids. The primary endpoint was the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) and change in the eGFR at 12 months after randomization. RESULTS The mean tacrolimus trough level of the study group was 4.51 ± 1.62 ng/mL , which was lower than that of the control group , at 6.75 ± 2.82 ng/mL ( P < 0.001). The primary endpoint was better in the study group in terms of change in eGFR ( P < 0.001). The month 12 eGFRs were 73.6 ± 28.4 and 68.3 ± 18.1 mL/min/1 .73 m ² in the study and the control groups , respectively , but the difference did not reach statistical significance ( P = 0.07). The incidence of adverse events was similar between the study and the control groups. CONCLUSIONS Minimizing tacrolimus to a trough level below 5 ng/mL combined with conventional EC-MPS can be considered in patients with a steady follow-up , as it was associated with small benefits in the changes of the eGFR ( Clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT01159080).
