  Flow is a well-known concept in the fields of positive and applied psychology. Examination of a large body of flow literature suggests there is a need for a conceptual model rooted in a cognitive approach to explain how this psychological phenomenon works. In this paper , we propose the Flow Engine Framework , a theoretical model explaining dynamic interactions between rearranged flow components and fundamental cognitive processes. Using an IPO framework ( Inputs- Processes- Outputs) including a feedback process , we organize flow characteristics into three logically related categories: inputs ( requirements for flow) , mediating and moderating cognitive processes ( attentional and motivational mechanisms) and outputs ( subjective and objective outcomes) , describing the process of the flow. Comparing flow with an engine , inputs are depicted as flow-fuel , core processes cylinder strokes and outputs as power created to provide motion.
