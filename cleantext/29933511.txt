  In this paper , I discuss the question of partiality and impartiality in the application of triage. Triage is a process in medical research which recommends that patients should be sorted for treatment according to the degree or severity of their injury. In employing the triage protocol , however , the question of partiality arises because socially vulnerable groups will be neglected since there is the likelihood that the social determinants of a patient 's health may diminish her chance of survival. As a process that is based on the severity of a patient 's injury , triage will be unfair , and hence negatively partial , to socially vulnerable people. Thus , I aim in this paper to show that the triage protocol fails as an impartial evaluative process because its only aim is to maximize survivability. I contend that: ( i) triage would lead to the neglect of the social condition of patients or victims , and ( ii) it will only serve the utilitarian purpose of maximization of outcomes which may not be justified in some cases.
