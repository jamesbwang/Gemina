  Conductivity of two-dimenstional ( 2D) materials , which largely determines the efficiency and reliability of nanodevices , is proportional to the product of carrier concentration and mobility. Conventional doping , such as ionic substitution or introduction of vacancies , increases carrier concentration and decreases carrier mobility due to the scattering or trapping of carriers. We propose a remote-doping strategy that enables the simultaneous enhancement of both parameters. Density functional theory calculations in 2D InSe reveal that adsorbing the molecule tetrathiafulvalene ( TTF) and applying a 4 % external tensile strain leads to an increase in the carrier concentration of the TTF-InSe system that is 13 orders of magnitude higher than that of the pristine counterpart , whereas the carrier mobility is enhanced by 35 % compared with the InSe monolayer. As a consequence of the synergetic role of molecule doping and strain engineering , ultrahigh conductivity of 1.85 Ã— 10
