  Failure of endovascular aneurysm<disease> repairs ( EVARs) requiring open conversion remains a major challenge. We analyzed indications for repair , operative strategies , and outcomes with a focus on iliac artery degeneration after endograft removal. A prospective , institutional database was reviewed to identify patients who underwent explantation of a failed EVAR device. Demographics , reason for failure , operative details including extent of endograft removal , and complications/survival were examined. Postexplantation computed tomography imaging was evaluated for iliac artery degeneration. There were 32 patients who underwent explantation from 2002 to 2017. Six patients were treated emergently for rupture. The majority were elderly ( average age , 76 Â± 8.5 years) , white ( 100 %) men ( 91 %) who had their EVAR graft inserted 45.5 months ( range , 0.3-86 months) before open conversion , usually at an outside institution ( 75 %). Explanted endografts included nine AneuRx ( Medtronic , Minneapolis , Minn) , nine Excluder ( W. L. Gore & Associates , Flagstaff , Ariz) , four Endurant ( Medtronic) , three Zenith ( Cook Medical , Bloomington , Ind) , three Powerlink/AFX ( Endologix , Irvine , Calif) , one Aorfix ( Lombard Medical , Oxfordshire , United Kingdom) , one Talent ( Medtronic) , and two unknown. Failure was due to endoleak in 91 % ( type I , 38 %; type II , 28 %; type III , 13 %; type V , 13 %) , infection in 6 % , and occlusion/kinking in 3 %. A previous attempt at endovascular salvage of EVAR occurred in 12 ( 37.5 %) patients. Operative approach was transabdominal in 69 % and retroperitoneal in 31 %. Initial aortic clamp position was supraceliac in 31 % , suprarenal in 31 % , and infrarenal in 38 %. Most patients had complete removal of their endograft ( n = 19 ( 59 %)) , with 22 ( 69 %) having at least the iliac limbs removed. Grafts with suprarenal fixation were more likely to have the upper main body left in situ ( 67 % vs 17 %; P = .029). The 30-day mortality was 6.3 % ( 3.8 % elective , 16.7 % ruptured) , and 31 % had a major complication. Of the 23 patients who had follow-up imaging , there was a trend for more iliac degeneration ( > 5 mm in growth) in those who had the iliac limbs removed ( 29.4 % vs 0 %; P = .184). Three patients with iliac limb removal required subsequent iliac endovascular intervention ( two for rupture). Patients who presented with a rupture had a decreased 5-year overall survival ( 33 %) compared with those who were converted electively ( 59 %). Both complete and partial endograft explantation , although morbid procedures , can be performed safely. Postoperative imaging surveillance is important , especially if the endograft has been removed from the iliac arteries , as degeneration can occur.
