  Using anti-scatter grids with high-resolution imaging detectors could result in grid-line artifacts , with increasing severity as detector resolution improves. Grid-line mask subtraction can result in residual artifacts that are due to residual scatter penetrating the grid and not subtracted. By subtracting this residual scatter , the grid artifacts can be minimized. In the previous works , an initial residual-scatter estimate was derived by placing lead markers on a test object; however , any change in the object geometry requires a new scatter estimate. Such a method is impractical to implement during a clinical procedure. In this work , we present a new method to derive the initial scatter estimate to eliminate grid-line artifacts during a procedure. A standard stationary Smit-Roentgen x-ray grid ( line density- 70 lines/cm , grid ratio- 13:1) was used with a high-resolution CMOS detector ( Dexela Model 1207 , pixel size- 75 Î¼m) to image an anthropomorphic head phantom. The initial scatter estimate was derived from the image itself and the grid artifacts were eliminated using recursive correction estimation; this result was compared to that with the estimate derived from placing lead markers on the phantom. In both cases , the contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR) was improved compared to the original image with grid artifacts. Percentage differences in CNR 's for three regions between the images corrected with the two estimates were less than 5 %. With the new method no a priori scatter distribution profiles are needed , eliminating the need to have libraries of pre-calculated scatter profiles and making the implementation more clinically practical.
