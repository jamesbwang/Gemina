  Background/aim: This study aimed to investigate differences in perioperative complications and short-term outcomes of patients who underwent abdominal sacrocolpopexy/sacrohysteropexy , laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy/sacrohysteropexy , sacrospinous ligament fixation ( SSLF) , and iliococcygeus fixation due to apical prolapse. Materials and methods: The present retrospective cohort study included 145 patients who underwent apical prolapse surgery performed by the same surgeons between 1/1/2011 and 30/6/2017. There were 68 abdominal sacrocolpopexies ( 44 sacrocolpopexies and 24 sacrohysteropexies) , 13 laparoscopic sacrocolpopexies ( 10 sacrocolpopexies and 3 sacrohysteropexies) , 57 SSLFs , and 7 iliococcygeus fixations. Patients ' short-term outcomes , perioperative complications , blood<symptom> loss<symptom> , operative time , and hospital stay were analyzed. Results: The mean operating time in the laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy group was 179.6 min versus 122.8 , 117.3 , and 107.1 min in the SSLF , abdominal sacrocolpopexy , and iliococcygeus fixation groups , respectively ( P < 0.01). The hospital stay was significantly shorter in the iliococcygeus fixation group ( 1.86 days) when compared with that of other groups ( P < 0.01). During a 6-month follow-up period , no prolapse recurrence or mesh exposure was observed in any groups. Wound complications were more frequent in the abdominal sacrocolpopexy group. However , the overall complication rate of each group did not differ significantly ( P = 0.332). Conclusion: Overall , complication rates and short-term outcomes for the abdominal , laparoscopic , and vaginal surgical procedures were not statistically significantly different. However , minimally invasive approaches were associated with reduced procedural-related morbidity.
