  The aim of this study was to assess patients ' satisfaction and functional outcome of dorsal hand unit reconstruction in burn patients in Shiraz , southern Iran.From September 2013 to February 2017 , 11 patients ( 15 hands) with hand aesthetic complaint who were unhappy with their hand appearance were included for dorsal hand unit reconstruction. Under general anesthesia and tourniquet control , the burned tissue on dorsal surface of the hands was excised and a thick partial thickness skin graft was used for coverage , whereas the fingers were fixed by sutures to the palm. After 1 year , the five-points scale was used for evaluation of patients ' satisfaction regarding the five major activities considered for hand function before and after operation. The mean age of the patients was 25.8 Â± 5.17 years. The skin grafts were well taken. Six ( 40 %) and eight patients ( 53 %) reported the result of operation as completely satisfied and satisfied , respectively. Dorsal hand unit reconstruction in patients with dorsal hand contracture and significant dorsal scar was shown to simultaneously improve the function and aesthetic outcome of the surgery.
