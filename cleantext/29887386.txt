  To assess whether infants with colic that resolved before 6 months of age have poorer medium-term outcomes than infants without colic Comparative study of 2 prospective , community-based cohorts of children aged 2-3 years in Melbourne , Australia: children from the Baby Biotics study , with previously diagnosed Wessel criteria of colic without problem crying at 6 months ( True Colic Cohort) , vs children from the Baby Business trial , without problem crying at 1 , 4 , and 6 months ( No Colic Cohort). Caregiver report of child internalizing and externalizing behaviors ( primary outcome) , temperament , regulatory ( crying/sleeping/feeding) problems , and family functioning at child age 2-3 years was collected. We conducted regression analyses of mean differences/ORs adjusted for child sex , age , social disadvantage , parental education , and maternal mental health. In total , 74 % of the original Baby Biotics ( n = 124) sample and 75 % of the Baby Business ( n = 503) sample completed questionnaires. In adjusted analyses , there were no significant differences between the True Colic Cohort ( n = 99) and No Colic Cohort ( n = 182) in internalizing behavior problems ( adjusted mean difference 0.73; 95 % CI -3.96 to 5.43 , P = .76) or externalizing behavior problems ( adjusted mean difference -1.53; 95 % CI -6.02 to 2.97 , P = .51). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in temperament , parental perception of regulatory problems , or family functioning. Infants with colic whose crying self-resolves do not experience adverse effects regarding child behavior , regulatory abilities , temperament , or family functioning in the medium term. Parents and clinicians can be reassured that infant crying as the result of colic , and related stress , is short-lived and will likely resolve.
