  Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness<symptom> among working-age adults. Early detection of this condition is critical for good prognosis. In this paper , we demonstrate the use of convolutional neural networks ( CNNs) on color fundus images for the recognition task of diabetic retinopathy staging. Our network models achieved test metric performance comparable to baseline literature results , with validation sensitivity of 95 %. We additionally explored multinomial classification models , and demonstrate that errors primarily occur in the misclassification of mild disease as normal due to the CNNs inability to detect subtle disease features. We discovered that preprocessing with contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization and ensuring dataset fidelity by expert verification of class labels improves recognition of subtle features. Transfer learning on pretrained GoogLeNet and AlexNet models from ImageNet improved peak test set accuracies to 74.5 % , 68.8 % , and 57.2 % on 2-ary , 3-ary , and 4-ary classification models , respectively.
