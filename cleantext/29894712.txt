  Pepper chat fruit viroid ( PCFVd) is one of the most important tomato and pepper diseases causing serious losses , affecting productivity , fruit quality and even international seed trade. Reverse transcription Loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( RT-LAMP) is a fast and reliable RNA amplification assay , out competing conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) in robustness , analytical sensitivity and specificity , and cost-effectiveness. In this work , a PCFVd specific RT-LAMP detection assay , based on a set of six primers was developed. Under the optimized conditions , PCFVd could be detected within 15 min , with a sensitivity of detecting PCFVd that was almost the same as a probe-based qRT-PCR and 10-100 times higher than the available RT-PCR methods. No cross-amplification with other viroids and tomato viruses was observed. The validated assay was also adapted for convenient on-site detection. Besides replacing the full RNA extraction with a simple lysis procedure , several visualization options , of which the use of SYTO9 was the most convenient , were presented to accommodate any in-field application of the method.
