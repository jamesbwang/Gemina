  We examine the importance of early life displacement and nutrition on hypertension ( HTN) and diabetes in older Colombian adults ( 60 + years) exposed to rapid demographic , epidemiological , and nutritional transitions , and armed conflict. We compare early life nutritional status and adult health in other middle- and high-income countries. In Colombia ( Survey of Health , Wellbeing and Aging ( SABE)- Bogot√°) , we estimate the effects of early life conditions ( displacement due to armed conflict and violence , hunger , low height , and not born in the capital city) and obesity on adult health; we compare the effects of low height on adult health in Mexico , South Africa ( Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health ( SAGE)) , the United States , and England ( Health and Retirement Study ( HRS) , English Longitudinal Study of Ageing ( ELSA)). Early life displacement , early poor nutrition , and adult obesity increase the risk of HTN and diabetes in Colombia. Being short is most detrimental for HTN in Colombian males. Colombian data provide new evidence into how early life conditions and adult obesity contribute to older adult health.
