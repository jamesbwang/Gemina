  The aim of this work was to develop computational intelligence models based on neural networks ( NN) , fuzzy models ( FM) , and support vector machines ( SVM) to predict physicochemical composition of bee pollen mixture given their botanical origin. To obtain the predominant plant genus of pollen ( was the output variable) , based on physicochemical composition ( were the input variables of the predictive model) , prediction models were learned from data. For the inverse case study , input/output variables were swapped. The probabilistic NN prediction model obtained 98.4 % of correct classification of the predominant plant genus of pollen. To obtain the secondary and tertiary plant genus of pollen , the results present a lower accuracy. To predict the physicochemical characteristic of a mixture of bee pollen , given their botanical origin , fuzzy models proven the best results with small prediction errors , and variability lower than 10 %.
