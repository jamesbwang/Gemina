  The purpose of this study was to determine the capacity of indigenous microbes in tailings to degrade bitumen aerobically , and if acetate biostimulation further improved degradation. Fluid fine tailings , from Base Mine Lake ( BML) , were used as microbial inocula , and bitumen in the tailings served as a potential carbon source during the experiment. The tailings were capped with 0.22 μm-filtered BML surface water with or without BML bitumen and acetate addition and incubated for 100 days at 20 °C. CO
