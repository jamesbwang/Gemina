  Considering the progressive depletion of groundwater quantity and the alteration of superficial and groundwater quality in the Madrid region , a highly populated area with extended urbanizations in the north and agricultural activities in the south , we conducted a monitoring study over a period of 2.5 years ( 2015-2017). The study was conducted in the Jarama-Taju√±a shallow alluvial aquifer system located southeast of Madrid , where the exploitation of the aquifer and the Jarama river have increased exponentially in the last decade being affected by both urban and agricultural activities. Our aims were to provide: i) a geochemical characterization of the surface and groundwater properties; ii) identify the process responsible for the geochemical evolution and mineralization of the waters; iii) assess the water quality ( i.e. nitrates , ammonia<pathogen> , sodium and chloride as potential contaminants) and the water suitability for irrigation ( SAR , Wilcox , KI and MH indexes); and iv) identify the main sources of contamination in the area. A set of plots , ion ratios , correlation coefficients , multivariate statistical analyses and indexes were performed. Results indicated that rock weathering largely controls the hydrogeochemistry of the system and that wastewater treatment plant discharges and agricultural practices significantly affect the composition of the water , causing an important decline of both surface and groundwater chemical quality. Nonetheless , water suitability for irrigation is admissible. Thus , taking additional measures to increase its quality are not necessary. With this study we aimed to establish a base line to evaluate future changes in the groundwater properties from the Madrid region enabling the planners and policy makers to develop a strategy to mitigate the impact of the exponential increase of urban and agriculture activities on groundwater resources.
