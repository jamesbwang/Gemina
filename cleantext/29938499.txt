  Strong in-plane anisotropy of atomic layer and thin-film black phosphorus ( P) offers new device perspectives and stimulates increasing interest and explorations , where precisely determining the black P crystal orientation and anisotropic axes is a necessity. Here , we demonstrate that the crystal orientation and intrinsic in-plane optical anisotropy of black P crystals in a broad thickness range ( from ∼ 5 to ∼ 300 nm) can be directly and precisely determined , by polarized reflectance measurement alone , in visible range. Combining experiments with modeling of optical anisotropy and multilayer interference effects , we elucidate the underlying principles and validate these measurements. The polarized reflectance method is not only easy to implement but also deterministic , nondestructive , and effective for both on-substrate and suspended black P atomic layers and thin films.
