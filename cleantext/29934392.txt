  Sedentary behaviour is a distinct risk factor for cardiovascular disease ( CVD) and could partly explain the increased prevalence of CVD in people with spinal cord injury ( SCI). Interrupting prolonged sitting periods with regular short bouts of walking acutely suppresses postprandial glucose and lipids in able-bodied individuals. However , the acute CVD risk marker response to breaking up prolonged sedentary time in people with SCI has not been investigated. A randomised two-condition laboratory crossover trial will compare: ( 1) breaking up prolonged sedentary time with 2 min moderate-intensity arm-crank activity every 20 min , with ( 2) uninterrupted prolonged sedentary time ( control) in people with SCI. Outcomes will include acute effects on postprandial glucose , insulin , lipids and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. Blood samples will be collected and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> measured at regular intervals during each 5 1/2- hour condition. This study was approved by the Cambridge South National Health Service Research Ethics Committee. This research will help determine if breaking up prolonged sedentary time could be effective in lowering CVD risk in people with SCI. The findings of the research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated to relevant user groups. ISRCTN51868437; Pre-results.
