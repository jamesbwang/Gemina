  Since donated red blood cells must be constantly refrigerated , they are often unavailable in remote areas and battlefields. The goal of this study was to synthesize a highly stable blood substitute that does not require refrigeration. Specifically , the extracellular haemoglobin ( a.k.a. erythrocruorin , Ec) of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris<pathogen> erythrocruororin ( LtEc) was cross-linked with poly ( acrylic acid) ( PAA) and ethylene diamine ( EDA). PAGE analysis of the LtEc nanoparticles reveals cross-linking between subunits , while dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy show that cross-linking significantly increases the size of the LtEc nanoparticles ( 164 ± 13.9 nm). Cross-linking also significantly increased the thermal stability of the LtEc nanoparticles by 10 °C ( T
