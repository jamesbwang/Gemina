  Molecular networks are at the core of most cellular decisions , but are often difficult to comprehend. Reverse engineering of network architecture from their functions has proved fruitful to classify and predict the structure and function of molecular networks , suggesting new experimental tests and biological predictions. We present φ-evo , an open-source program to evolve in silico phenotypic networks performing a given biological function. We include implementations for evolution of biochemical adaptation , adaptive sorting for immune recognition , metazoan development ( somitogenesis , hox patterning) , as well as Pareto evolution. We detail the program architecture based on C , Python 3 , and a Jupyter interface for project configuration and network analysis. We illustrate the predictive power of φ-evo by first recovering the asymmetrical structure of the lac operon regulation from an objective function with symmetrical constraints. Second , we use the problem of hox-like embryonic patterning to show how a single effective fitness can emerge from multi-objective ( Pareto) evolution. φ-evo provides an efficient approach and user-friendly interface for the phenotypic prediction of networks and the numerical study of evolution itself.
