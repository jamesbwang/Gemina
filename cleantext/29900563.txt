  SRA Dose-Response and Microbial Risk Analysis Specialty Groups jointly sponsored symposia that addressed the intersections between the `` microbiome revolution '' and dose response. Invited speakers presented on innovations and advances in gut and nasal microbiota ( normal microbial communities) in the first decade after the Human Microbiome Project began. The microbiota and their metabolites are now known to influence health and disease directly and indirectly , through modulation of innate and adaptive immune systems and barrier function. Disruption of healthy microbiota is often associated with changes in abundance and diversity of core microbial species ( dysbiosis) , caused by stressors including antibiotics , chemotherapy , and disease. Nucleic-acid-based metagenomic methods demonstrated that the dysbiotic host microbiota no longer provide normal colonization resistance to pathogens , a critical component of innate immunity of the superorganism. Diverse pathogens , probiotics , and prebiotics were considered in human and animal models ( in vivo and in vitro). Discussion included approaches for design of future microbial dose-response studies to account for the presence of the indigenous microbiota that provide normal colonization resistance , and the absence of the protective microbiota in dysbiosis. As NextGen risk analysis methodology advances with the `` microbiome revolution , '' a proposed new framework , the Health Triangle , may replace the old paradigm based on the Disease Triangle ( focused on host , pathogen , and environment) and germophobia. Collaborative experimental designs are needed for testing hypotheses about causality in dose-response relationships for pathogens present in our environments that clearly compete in complex ecosystems with thousands of bacterial species dominating the healthy superorganism.
