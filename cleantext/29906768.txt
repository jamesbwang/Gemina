  This paper reports the comparative analysis , by means of electric impedance spectroscopy measurements , of three different cell lines subjected to electroporative pulses. The multifrequency information is recorded simultaneously at 21 frequency values in the range between 5 kHz and 1.3 MHz using a multisine based measuring approach. The analysis of the pre-electroporation impedance spectra shows how the system is able to detect differences and similarities between the cell lines under analysis. Particularly , a good agreement is found between the average cell diameter and the characteristic frequency ( the frequency corresponding to a maximum in the imaginary part of the impedance). The measurements performed during electroporation at three different electric field intensities show how the impedance spectra changes dynamically between the consecutive pulses of a train of 8,100 Âµs pulses delivered at 1 Hz repetition rate. There are clear differences between the changes in the impedance measured at low and high frequency. The multifrequency information has been fitted to an electrical equivalent model in order to understand the different contributions in the observed impedance changes ( mainly separate between membrane permeabilization and the conductivity changes in the extracellular medium). Finally , a ratio of the low and high frequency impedance information is used to estimate the accumulated impedance decay and to compare it to the internalization of a fluorescent permeabilization reporter. The comparison between both techniques at the three electroporation electric field intensities assayed confirms the ability of impedance measurements to detect in a precise way the level of membrane permeabilization. Additionally , this study demonstrates how the real time information obtained thanks to impedance measurements can provide a more precise quantification of the membrane permeabilization extent.
