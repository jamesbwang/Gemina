  Non-viral vector gene delivery is generally limited by its potential toxicity problems , poor transfection abilities , serum stability , or relatively complex construction processes of modified polyplexes. Thus , we develop an efficient and stable polyplex system through convenient construction methods. Here , polyethyleneimine ( PEI) 1.8 kDa and glutaraldehyde ( GA) are used to construct a novel twice-condensed pDNA polyplex system using a one-pot construction method , including pH-responsive C ( double bond , length as m-dash) N linkages by which different PEI molecules on one single polyplex can link with each other. In this system , smaller particle sizes , higher zeta potentials and better serum stabilities are achieved without PEGylation or other chemical modifications using lyophobic segments , but via pH-responsive linkages that ensure the escape of nucleic acids. This polyplex system is used to deliver the pDNA of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) whose half-life period in vivo is only around 30 minutes. Compared with polyplexes prepared using PEI 25 kDa , cells and rats treated with twice-condensed VEGF pDNA polyplexes express significantly more VEGF or myelin basic protein ( MBP) , and this new polyplex system showed fewer adverse effects in vitro and in vivo. In addition , revascularization and neurogenesis are also discovered in the rat sciatic nerve crush injury model.
