  Stroke-like migraine attacks after radiation therapy ( SMART) is a late-onset complication of cerebral irradiation , clinically characterized by headache<symptom> , seizures<symptom> and focal deficits. We describe two patients with SMART presenting with focal status epilepticus and headache<symptom> We believe that SMART is a misnomer that misjudge seizures<symptom> among clinical features and we suggest to rename this entity as '' Seizure<symptom> with Migraine-like Attacks after Radiation Therapy ''. The new acronym , modified in its meaning but not in its form ( SMART) , better reflects the main clinical features and may allow neurologists to recognize this condition more easily.
