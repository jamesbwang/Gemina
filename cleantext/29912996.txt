  Once-weekly ( OW) glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists ( GLP-1 RAs) have demonstrated improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D) , and some have a number of other benefits , including weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , improvements in blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and lipid profiles , and cardiovascular protection. They also provide a therapy option with a low risk of hypoglycemia , an attractive choice for many patients. Molecular structure and pharmacokinetic properties vary among GLP-1 RAs , with some more closely related than others to native glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1). OW GLP-1 RAs have various modifications to their molecular structure that make the molecules resistant to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4) , increasing the half-life of these drugs and making them suitable for OW administration. These differences in the molecular structures and pharmacokinetic properties between the various OW GLP-1 RAs help to explain the differences in efficacy , mechanisms , and safety profiles among the drugs , and these considerations can help primary care physicians to optimize prescribing practices.
