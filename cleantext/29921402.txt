  Herpetospermum caudigerum ( H. caudigerum; HC) , popularly known as `` Sejimeiduo '' in Tibet , it is widely used in Tibetan traditional medicine for the treatment of dyspepsia , liver and colic diseases. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of H. caudigerum extract ( HCE) on suppressing liver injury induced by carbon tetra chloride ( CCl4). For this purpose , we used CCl4 to induce acute liver injury in mouse model. The protective effects of HCE against liver injury were evaluated by biochemical parameters , histopathological and immunohistochemical staining. The results showed that the superoxide dismutase ( SOD) activity was significantly increased with the increasing dose of HCE as compared to the CCl4-treated group ( p less than 0.01); while AST and ALT levels in serum , MDA and MPO in liver were reduced in a dose-dependent manner. The histopathology showed that HCE treatment promoted the recovery of histopathological changes in liver in a dose-dependent way. Meanwhile , there was a higher expression of caspase-3 and NF-κB in the nucleus of several liver cells in the CCl4-induced group , and a low expression of caspase-3 and NF-κB were found with the increasing dose of HCE. Therefore , the present study suggests that HCE is a potent hepatoprotective agent that can treat acute liver injury and this ability may be attributed towards its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential.
