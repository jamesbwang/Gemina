  There are no guidelines regarding post-treatment surveillance specific to skull base chordomas. To determine an optimal imaging surveillance schedule to detect both local and distant metastatic skull base chordoma recurrences. A retrospective review of 91 patients who underwent treatment for skull base chordoma between 1993 and 2017 was conducted. Time to and location of local and distant recurrence ( s) were cataloged. Existing chordoma surveillance recommendations ( National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN) , London and South East Sarcoma Network ( LSESN) , European Society for Medical Oncology ( ESMO) , Chordoma Global Consensus Group ( CGCG)) were applied to our cohort to compare the number of recurrent patients and months of undiagnosed tumor growth between surveillances. These findings were used to inform the creation of a revised imaging surveillance protocol ( MD Anderson Cancer Center Chordoma Imaging Protocol ( MDACC-CIP)) , presented here. Thirty-four patients with 79 local/systemic recurrences met inclusion criteria. Mean age at diagnosis and follow-up time were 45 yr and 79 mo , respectively. The MDACC-CIP imaging protocol significantly reduced the time to diagnosis of recurrence compared with the LSESN and CGCG/ESMO imaging protocols for surveillance of local disease with a cumulative/average of 576/16 .9 ( LSESN) , 336/9 .8 ( CGCG) , and 170/5 .0 ( MDACC-CIP) months of undetected growth , respectively. The NCCN and MDACC-CIP guidelines for distant metastatic surveillance identified a cumulative/average of 65/6 .5 and 51/5 .1 mo of undetected growth , respectively , and were not significantly different. The MDACC-CIP for skull base chordoma accounts for recurrence trends unique to this disease , including a higher rate of leptomeningeal spread than sacrococcygeal primaries , resulting in improved sensitivity and prompt diagnosis.
