  Excessive sleepiness ( ES) is associated with several sleep disorders , including narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA). A role for monoaminergic systems in treating these conditions is highlighted by the clinical use of US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs that act on these systems , such as dextroamphetamine , methylphenidate , modafinil , and armodafinil. Solriamfetol ( JZP-110) is a wake-promoting agent that is currently being evaluated to treat ES in patients with narcolepsy or OSA. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that the wake-promoting effects of solriamfetol differ from medications such as modafinil and amphetamine. The goal of the current studies was to characterize the mechanism of action of solriamfetol at monoamine transporters using in vitro and in vivo assays. Results indicate that solriamfetol has dual reuptake inhibition activity at dopamine ( DA; IC
