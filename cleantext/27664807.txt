  The Fontan operation creates a circulation characterized by elevated central venous pressure and low cardiac output. Over time , these characteristics result in a predictable and persistent decline in exercise performance that is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality. A medical therapy that targets the abnormalities of the Fontan circulation might , therefore , be associated with improved outcomes. Udenafil , a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor , has undergone phase I/II testing in adolescents who have had the Fontan operation and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in the short term. However , there are no data regarding the long-term efficacy of udenafil in this population. The Fontan Udenafil Exercise Longitudinal ( FUEL) Trial is a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial being conducted by the Pediatric Heart Network in collaboration with Mezzion Pharma Co , Ltd.. This trial is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with udenafil will lead to an improvement in exercise capacity in adolescents who have undergone the Fontan operation. A safety extension trial , the FUEL Open-Label Extension Trial ( FUEL OLE) , offers the opportunity for all FUEL subjects to obtain open-label udenafil for an additional 12 months following completion of FUEL , and evaluates the long-term safety and tolerability of this medication. This manuscript describes the rationale and study design for FUEL and FUEL OLE. Together , these trials provide an opportunity to better understand the role of medical management in the care of those who have undergone the Fontan operation.
