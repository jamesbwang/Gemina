  Studies on membrane fouling during treatment of oil refinery wastewater ( ORW) via membrane bioreactor ( MBR) are currently lacking , and associated fouling challenges are largely undocumented. Using advanced chemical and Illumina sequencing approach , we investigated the complex bio-physiochemical interactions responsible for foulant-membrane interactions during treatment of ORW. After nearly 2 months of the MBR operation , COD removal reached maximal of 97.15 ± 1.85 % , while oil and grease removal was maintained at 96.6 ± 2.6 % , during the treatment duration. Most of the less or non-biodegradable oil moieties ( > 0.5 μm) progressively accumulated on the membrane as the influent oil concentration increased. Presence of relatively higher unsaturated extracellular polymers ( 100.6 mg/g VSS) like fulvic acid and aromatic-like compounds at high volumetric loading ( ~ 18.7 kg COD/m
