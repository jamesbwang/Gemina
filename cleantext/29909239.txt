  IgE is the antibody isotype found at the lowest concentration in the circulation. However IgE can undeniably play an important role in mediating allergic reactions; best exemplified by the clinical benefits of anti-IgE monoclonal antibody ( omalizumab) therapy for some allergic diseases. This review will describe our current understanding of the interactions between IgE and its main receptors FcεRI and CD23 ( FcεRII). We will review the known and potential functions of IgE in health and disease: in particular , its detrimental roles in allergic diseases and chronic spontaneous urticaria , and its protective functions in host defense against parasites and venoms. Finally , we will present an overview of the drugs that are in clinical development or have therapeutic potential for IgE-mediated allergic diseases.
