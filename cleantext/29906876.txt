  Tracking tracer particles in heterogeneous environments plays an important role in unraveling material properties. These heterogeneous structures are often static and depend on the sample realizations. Sample-to-sample fluctuations of such disorder realizations sometimes become considerably large. When we investigate the sample-to-sample fluctuations , fundamental averaging procedures are a thermal average for a single disorder realization and the disorder average for different disorder realizations. Here we report on non-self-averaging phenomena in quenched trap models with finite system sizes , where we consider the periodic and the reflecting boundary conditions. Sample-to-sample fluctuations of diffusivity greatly exceed trajectory-to-trajectory fluctuations of diffusivity in the corresponding annealed model. For a single disorder realization , the time-averaged mean square displacement and position-dependent observables converge to constants because of the existence of the equilibrium distribution. This is a manifestation of ergodicity. As a result , the time-averaged quantities depend neither on the initial condition nor on the thermal histories but depend crucially on the disorder realization.
