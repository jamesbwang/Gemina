  In bacteriophages related to T4 , hydroxymethylcytosine ( hmC) is incorporated into the genomic DNA during DNA replication and is then further modified to glucosyl-hmC by phage-encoded glucosyltransferases. Previous studies have shown that RB69 shares a core set of genes with T4 and relatives. However , unlike the other & ldquo; RB & rdquo; phages , RB69 is unable to recombine its DNA with T4 or with the other & ldquo; RB & rdquo; isolates. In addition , despite having homologs to the T4 enzymes used to synthesize hmC , RB69 has no identified homolog to known glucosyltransferase genes. In this study we sought to understand the basis for RB69 & rsquo; s behavior using high-pH anion exchange chromatography ( HPAEC) and mass spectrometry. Our analyses identified a novel phage epigenetic DNA sugar modification in RB69 DNA , which we have designated arabinosyl-hmC ( ara-hmC). We sought a putative glucosyltranserase responsible for this novel modification and determined that RB69 also has a novel transferase gene , ORF003c , that is likely responsible for the arabinosyl-specific modification. We propose that ara-hmC was responsible for RB69 being unable to participate in genetic exchange with other hmC-containing T-even phages , and for its described incipient speciation. The RB69 ara-hmC also likely protects its DNA from some anti-phage type-IV restriction endonucleases. Several T4-related phages , such as
