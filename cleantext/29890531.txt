  There are numerous reasons for facial palsy , which range from idiopathic palsy ( Bell 's palsy) to destruction of the facial nerve by a malignant salivary gland tumor. If the chance of spontaneous recovery is low or there is no drug therapy available , surgery is a therapeutical option. Recently , larger studies were published by specialized centers which enable a more individualized therapeutical concept to achieve tone , symmetry and movement of the paralyzed face based on a detailed preoperative assessment.
