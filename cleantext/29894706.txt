  CD44 , a glycoprotein , has been reported to have relationship with resistance to radiation in prostate cancer ( Cap) cells. However , its molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this study , we demonstrated that inhibited CD44 enhanced the radiosentivity in Cap cells. It has been hypothesized that CD44 combine with ERBB2 and activate downstream phosphated protein to mediate DNA damage repair. Therefore , we conducted a detailed analysis of effects of radiation by clonogenic assay and immunofluorescence stain for p-H2AX foci. The downstream of CD44/ERBB2 and DNA damage repair proteins was detected by western blot. The results reveal that CD44 interacted with ERBB2 , the downstream of CD44/ERBB2 was p-p38 when Cap cells were irradiated. Among the pathways , homologous recombination ( HR) related proteins Mre11 and Rad50 were involved in CD44/ERBB2/p-p 38 mediated radioresistance in Cap. In conclusion , CD44 could stabilize ERBB2 and co-activate p-p38 expression then promote the DNA damage repair by HR pathway , which finally contribute to the radioresistance of CaP.
