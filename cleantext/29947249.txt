  To present our technique and initial results of dual combined retroperitoneal and transperitoneal laparoscopic approach for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) with level 0- II venous tumor thrombus. We included nine consecutive patients with RCC and level 0- II inferior vena cava ( IVC) thrombus who underwent laparoscopic radical nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy using dual combined laparoscopic approach in our department between January 2016 and June 2017. The mean operative time was 150 min when cavotomy was not performed and 240 min when cavotomy with thrombectomy was required. The mean IVC clamping time was 24 min and the mean blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was 300 ml. We encountered no major intra-operative or post-operative complications ( Clavien III-IV). The patients were discharged a mean of 7 days after the procedure. At the 6-month follow-up all patients were alive. One patient presented a retroperitoneal enlarged lymph node and started systemic treatment. The dual combined laparoscopic approach for kidney tumors with level 0-II IVC thrombus is feasible , reproducible and especially useful in patients with complex renal pedicle. The technique provides early arterial control by retroperitoneal approach , which reduces the blood flow through the renal vein and has the advantage of minimal mobilization of the thrombus-bearing renal vein; it therefore lowers the risk of tumor embolism and intra-operative
