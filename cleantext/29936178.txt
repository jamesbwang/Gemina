  We previously reported that an orally administered dipeptide , Arg-Phe ( RF) , which causes enteroendocrine cell responses , lowered blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> in spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHRs). In this study , we found that Phe-Trp ( FW) , induced the most potent enteroendocrine cell responses out of total 338 dipeptides. An FW analogue , Phe-Trp-Gly-Lys ( FWGK) , which was effectively produced by tryptic digestion of bovine serum albumin , decreased blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> after oral administration. The minimum effective dose of FWGK ( 50 Î¼g/kg) was 1/300 of that of RF ( 15 mg/kg). FWGK stimulated cholecystokinin ( CCK) secretion in the enteroendocrine cells and exhibited vasorelaxing and antihypertensive effects via the CCK
