  Despite the great achievements of nanomedicines made in cancer chemotherapy , precise tumor targeting and deep penetration are still major challenges. Many nanomedicines can only passively accumulate near leaky site of tumor vessels through the enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR) effect and can not reach the deep region of tumor. To improve the tumor targeting , penetration and retention efficiency , an iRGD-mediated and enzyme-induced precise targeting gold nanoparticles system ( iRGD/AuNPs-A & C) was developed by simply coadministering a tumor-homing penetration peptide iRGD ( CRGDKGPDC) with a legumain responsive aggregable gold nanoparticle ( AuNPs-A & C). In vitro , iRGD/AuNPs-A & C showed a consistent increase rate in size with AuNPs-A & C , suggesting that iRGD/AuNPs-A & C could also aggregate in the presence of legumain , which was in favor of the enhanced retention in tumor microenvironment. Meanwhile , iRGD/AuNPs-A & C showed higher 4T1 cells cellular uptake in vitro and presented higher penetration and accumulation in breast tumor in vivo than AuNPs-A & C , leading to enhanced tumor imaging efficacy and the improved chemotherapeutic effect to 4T1-bearing mice. These results suggested that the iRGD-mediated and enzyme-induced dual-functional nanoplatform was promising for the 4T1 tumor imaging and treatment.
