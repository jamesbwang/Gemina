  In spite of its ubiquity in strongly correlated systems , the competition of paired and nematic ground states remains poorly understood. Recently such a competition was reported in the two-dimensional electron gas at filling factor ν = 5/2. At this filling factor a pressure-induced quantum phase transition was observed from the paired fractional quantum Hall state to the quantum Hall nematic. Here we show that the pressure-induced paired-to-nematic transition also develops at ν = 7/2 , demonstrating therefore this transition in both spin branches of the second orbital Landau level. However , we find that pressure is not the only parameter controlling this transition. Indeed , ground states consistent with those observed under pressure also develop in a sample measured at ambient pressure , but in which the electron-electron interaction was tuned close to its value at the quantum critical point. Our experiments suggest that electron-electron interactions play a critical role in driving the paired-to-nematic transition.
