  Papillomas of the female breast is a relatively frequent lesion<symptom> , and the majority are benign when excised. However , some may host malignant or premalignant areas. Consequently , it is a worldwide accepted principle to excise the lesion<symptom> whenever diagnosed. However , this leads to a large number of patients having an unnecessary operation. The present study was designed to investigate whether we could find clinical , radiological and pathological factors in the preoperative , diagnostic setting that could identify patients hosting a benign papilloma in order to avoid operation. The patient material consisted of 260 patients , all with a preoperative diagnosis of a papillomatous process in core biopsy. The lesion<symptom> was excised , and 71 % had a benign lesion<symptom>. The rest had lesions<symptom> ranging from premalignant to malignant. In the clinical , radiological and histopathological investigations conducted , we were not able to identify factors that statistically significant could predict whether the lesion<symptom> was benign or malignant. However , our data showed a higher prevalence of malignant and premalignant lesions<symptom> for older patient , larger lesions<symptom> , and lesions<symptom> found at a longer distance from the papilla. We conclude that , since almost 30 % of the patients in our study ended up with a premalignant or malignant diagnosis , where no statistically significant preoperative factors could indicate a benign outcome , operation is warranted in all patients with a preoperative diagnosis of a papillomatous
