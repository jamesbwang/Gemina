  Evaluating the effects of heart cavity volume , presence and absence of perfusion defect , gender and type of study ( stress and rest) on the difference of systolic parameters of myocardial perfusion scan in 16 and 8 framing gated SPECT imaging. Cardiac gated SPECT in both 16 and 8 framing simultaneously and both stress and rest phases at one-day protocol was performed for 50 patients. Data have been reconstructed by filter back projection ( FBP) method and left ventricular ( LV) systolic parameters were calculated by using QGS software. The effect of some factors such as LV cavity volume , presence and absence of perfusion defect , gender and type of study on data difference between 8 and 16 frames were evaluated. The differences in ejection fraction ( EF) , end-diastolic volume ( EDV) and end-systolic volume ( ESV) in both stress and rest were statistically significant. Difference in both framing was more in stress for EF and ESV , and was more in rest for EDV. Study type had a significant effect on differences in systolic parameters while gender had a significant effect on differences in EF and ESV in rest between both framings. In conclusion , results of this study revealed that difference of both 16 and 8 frames data in systolic phase were statistically significant and it seems that because of better efficiency of 16 frames , it can not be replaced by 8 frames. Further well-designed studies are required to verify these findings.
