  Traumatic injuries and other conditions resulting in thenar loss and loss of opposition function can cause significant functional limitations. There are limited options available to restore function and bulk to the thenar musculature. A 26-year-old man had an unfortunate accident at work with a machine mixer creating a crush injury to his left hand. This required several debridements due to the tissue injury and resulted in loss of the thenar muscles and ability to oppose the thumb. He recovered well from the initial injury , however , was left with difficulty with grasp and holding objects due to the loss of thenar motion and strength. His function was also affected by the loss of bulk. He successfully underwent a free functional muscle reconstruction with his serratus anterior. This case report is a description of his reconstruction and a review of the literature. The patient had an excellent outcome. He obtained active opposition and improved grip strength , improving his activities of daily living and vocational life. The serratus anterior muscle can successfully be used for thumb opposition reconstruction. This case report demonstrates good outcomes for both motion and bulk restoration.
