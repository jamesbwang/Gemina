  Bioimpedance analysis ( BIA) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA) are commonly utilized for total and segmental body composition assessment , but the agreement between these methods varies. Group ( i.e. , constant error ( CE)) and individual error ( i.e. , standard error of estimate ( SEE) and 95 % limits of agreement ( LOAs)) of single-frequency BIA were determined in apparently healthy men and women ( n = 28 and 45 , respectively) when using DXA as a reference method. It was hypothesized that single-frequency BIA would provide lower error for the estimation of total and segmental FFM than FM and BF %. The CE for many of the total and segmental body composition comparisons revealed statistically significant ( all P < .05) mean differences ( FM
