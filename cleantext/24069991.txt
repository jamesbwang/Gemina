  The advent of laparoscopy has revolutionized surgical practice within the last 30 years. Conversion to open surgery , however , remains necessary at times , even for the most experienced laparoscopic surgeon. The kids ' inpatient database was analyzed for 2006 , 2009 , and 2012 for patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy and conversion to open ( CPT 470.1 and V64 .41 , respectively). Variables included in multivariable analysis were determined based on those variables found to have significance on univariate analysis. A total of 104,865 patients , ages 0-17 years , underwent laparoscopic appendectomy during the three study periods. Of these , 2370 ( 2.2 %) laparoscopic surgeries were converted to open appendectomy. Multivariable logistic regression showed significantly higher rates of conversion amongst patients with peritonitis<disease> ( OR 6.7 , p < 0.001) or abscess<disease> ( OR 14.3 , p < 0.001) , obesity ( OR 2.02 , p < 0.001) , age > 13 years ( OR 1.53 for ages 13-15 , OR 1.77 for ages 16-17 , p < 0.001 for both) , or cared for at rural hospitals ( OR 1.55 , p = 0.002). Rates of conversion decreased over time for children at adult hospitals and at urban hospitals , regardless of teaching status ( p < 0.001 for both). Risk factors for conversion from laparoscopic to open appendectomy included abscess<disease> , peritonitis<disease> , increased age , obesity , male gender , socioeconomic status and treatment at a non-pediatric-specific hospital , and the overall rate is decreasing over time.
