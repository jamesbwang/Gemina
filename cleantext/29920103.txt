  A versatile silver-promoted oxidative cascade reaction of N-aryl-3-alkylideneazetidines with carboxylic acids is reported , providing a very efficient pathway to functionalized fused pyridines. This method allows introduction of fused pyridine ring systems to heterocycles , drugs , and natural products. A mechanistic study revealed that silver salt is essential for the chemo- and regioselective ring expansion , sequential oxidative nucleophilic additions , and oxidative aromatization. This approach represents the first example of the strained N-heterocycles undergoing a cascade reaction with a Ï€ bond and a nucleophile together.
