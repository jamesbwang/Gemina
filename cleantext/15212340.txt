  Smoke inhalation leads to acute lung injury ( ALI) , a devastating clinical problem associated with high mortality rates. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 ( SOCS-1) is a negative regulator of proinflammatory cytokine signaling. We have found that adenoviral gene transfer of SOCS-1 ameliorates smoke inhalation-induced lung injury in C57BL/6 mice. We also found that the release of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP) was increased post smoke exposure , while oxidized ATP , an inhibitor of purinergic P2X7 receptor , suppressed smoke-induced NALP3 inflammasome assembly , caspase-1 activation , and K
