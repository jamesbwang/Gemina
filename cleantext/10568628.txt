  Caused by viral<disease> infection<disease> , postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN) is the most common chronic neuropathic pain. Various treatment modalities such as early use of nerve block therapy ( NBT) and pulsed radiofrequency ( PRF) have been studied in reducing pain , however , no consistent success was achieved in all the patients treated with single regimen. The combined therapy of PRF and NBT with different targeting mechanism are of interest and remains to be determined. Here we investigated the combined effects of pulsed radiofrequency ( PRF) with nerve block therapy ( NBT) in PHN patients in a prospective randomized clinical trial. Sixty PHN patients were divided into four groups (
