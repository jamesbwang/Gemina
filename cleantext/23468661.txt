  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE or lupus) ( OMIM: 152700) is a chronic autoimmune disease with debilitating inflammation<symptom> that affects multiple organ systems. The STAT1-STAT4 locus is one of the first and most highly-replicated genetic loci associated with lupus risk. We performed a fine-mapping study to identify plausible causal variants within the STAT1-STAT4 locus associated with increased lupus disease risk. Using complementary frequentist and Bayesian approaches in trans-ancestral Discovery and Replication cohorts , we found one variant whose association with lupus risk is supported across ancestries in both the Discovery and Replication cohorts: rs11889341. In B cell lines from patients with lupus and healthy controls , the lupus risk allele of rs11889341 was associated with increased STAT1 expression. We demonstrated that the transcription factor HMGA1 , a member of the HMG transcription factor family with an AT-hook DNA-binding domain , has enriched binding to the risk allele compared to the non-risk allele of rs11889341. We identified a genotype-dependent repressive element in the DNA within the intron of STAT4 surrounding rs11889341. Consistent with expression quantitative trait locus ( eQTL) analysis , the lupus risk allele of rs11889341 decreased the activity of this putative repressor. Altogether , we present a plausible molecular mechanism for increased lupus risk at the STAT1-STAT4 locus in which the risk allele of rs11889341 , the most probable causal variant , leads to elevated STAT1 expression in B cells due to decreased repressor activity mediated by increased binding of HMGA1.
