  A morphological and morphometric study of the skin of a variety of newborn marsupials ( Dasyurus viverrinus , Monodelphis domestica , Trichosurus vulpecula , Isoodon obesulus , Perameles nasuta , Phascolarctos cinereus<pathogen> , Potorous tridactylus , Petrogale penicillata , Thylogale thetidi , Macropus dorsalis) and of a monotreme hatchling ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus) was undertaken to assess the possibility of cutaneous gas exchange. Additionally , the lungs of some of these species were investigated to assess its structural degree at birth. The skin in the different newborn marsupials and the monotreme hatchling had a similar structure ( no hair follicles and no sebaceous or perspiratory glands) and was in all cases less developed than the skin of altricial eutherians. The thickness of the entire skin ( 36-186 μm) and its different layers , epidermis ( 6-29 μm) and dermis ( 29-171 μm) varied among the marsupial species and reflected the differences in size and developmental degree of the neonates. In the skin of all marsupial neonates and the monotreme hatchling , numerous superficial cutaneous capillaries were encountered , some closely associated with the epidermis , indicating the possibility that the skin participated in gaseous exchange. The skin of the newborn D. viverrinus had the highest capillary volume density and shortest skin diffusion barrier of all marsupial neonates , suggesting that skin gas exchange in the dasyurid neonate might be the most pronounced. A graduation of the skin capillary density among the marsupial neonates inversely followed the respective lung structure and general developmental degree of the neonates.
