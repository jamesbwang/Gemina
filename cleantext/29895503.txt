  The current gold-standard potency test for inactivated influenza<disease> vaccines is the single radial immunodiffusion ( SRD) assay. A number of alternative potency tests for inactivated influenza<disease> vaccines have been proposed in recent years. Evaluation of these new potency tests commonly involves comparison with SRD , in order to ascertain that the new method obtains values that correlate with those measured by the standard potency test. Here , we extended comparison of two methods , reverse-phase HPLC and SDS-PAGE , with SRD by assessing the methods ' capacity to detect loss of potency induced by various deliberate treatments of vaccine samples. We demonstrate that neither of these methods detected the loss of potency observed by SRD; importantly , neither SDS-PAGE nor reverse-phase HPLC reflected results from mouse experiments that showed decreased immunogenicity and protection in vivo. These results emphasise the importance of assessing the stability-indicating nature , ie the ability to measure loss of vaccine potency , of any potential new potency assay.
