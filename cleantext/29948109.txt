  Copper nanoparticles ( CNPs) were mixed with polyacrylonitrile ( PAN) and electrospun into nanofibres ( CuPAN nanofibres). PAN nanofibres containing 1.0 , 3.0 and 5.0 % copper ( w/v) displayed beads-on-string morphology with protrusions of copper particles. The diameter of the CuPAN nanofibres differed according to the copper content , ranging from 386 nm ( 1.0 % , w/v , copper) to 922 nm ( 5.0 % , w/v , copper). No chemical interaction of copper with PAN was observed when studied with X-ray diffraction , ATR-FTIR ( attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared) spectroscopy and TGA ( thermogravimetric analysis). None of the CuPAN nanofibres showed signs of degradation after 7 days in water. Bacteria suspended in random mobility buffer and filtered through a 3 % CuPAN nanofibre membrane ( 25 mm diameter , 75-80 Î¼m thickness) , at a filtration rate of 20 ml min
