  Anemia<symptom> causes blood flow redistribution and altered tissue metabolic behavior to sustain homeostatic oxygen consumption. We hypothesized that anemia<symptom> severity would correlate with increased regional fractional tissue oxygen extraction among premature neonates. Regional oxygen extraction was calculated using pulse oximetry and near-infrared spectroscopy data among neonates < 1,250 g during their first 10 postnatal days. Oxygen extraction was assessed for correlations with raw hematocrit levels and following grouping into hematocrit quartiles. Twenty-seven neonates with gestational age 27 ± 2 weeks and birth weight 966 ± 181 g underwent 116 hematocrit determinations. Cerebral and flank oxygen extraction inversely correlated with hematocrit ( cerebral Increases in tissue oxygen extraction may indicate early pathophysiologic responses to nascent anemia<symptom> in premature neonates.
