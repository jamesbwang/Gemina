  With increasing use of high-power laser settings for lithotripsy , the potential exists to induce thermal tissue damage. In vitro studies have demonstrated that temperature elevation sufficient to cause thermal tissue damage can occur with certain laser and irrigation settings. The objective of this pilot study was to measure caliceal fluid temperature during high-power laser lithotripsy in an in vivo porcine model. Four female pigs ( 30-35 kg) were placed under general anesthesia and positioned supine. Retrograde ureteroscopy with entry into upper or middle calices was performed. Thermocouples were placed into the calix by open exposure and puncture of the kidney or retrograde alongside the ureteroscope. A 242 μm laser fiber was positioned in the center of the calix and activated ( 0.5 J , 80 Hz , 40 W) for 60 seconds with high , medium , or no irrigation delivered in each trial. Finite element simulations of laser-induced heating in a renal calix were also performed. Peak temperatures of 84.8 °C , 63.9 °C , and 43.6 °C were recorded for no , medium , and high irrigation , respectively. Mean time to reach threshold of thermal injury ( t High-power holmium laser settings ( 40 W) can induce potentially injurious temperatures in the porcine in vivo model , particularly with slower irrigation rates. Characterization of thermal dose across a broader range of laser parameter settings is underway to map out the thermal safety envelope.
