  Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) are multipotent progenitors present in the bone<disease> marrow stroma and in subcutaneous abdominal fat , an abundant and easily accessible source of MSCs with the ability to differentiate along multiple lineage pathways. The stem cell-associated transcription co-factor Zinc Finger Protein 521 ( ZNF521/zfp521) has been implicated in the control of the homeostasis of hematopoietic , neural and osteo-adipogenic progenitors. Here we document through the analysis of a panel of human adipose-derived stem cells ( hADSCs) , that ZNF521 strongly inhibits the generation of mature adipocytes. Enforced overexpression of ZNF521 in these cells resulted in a significant delay and reduction in adipocyte differentiation upon exposure to inducers of adipogenesis. Of particular relevance , ZNF521 was able to inhibit the expression of ZNF423 , recently identified as an essential commitment factor necessary for the generation of pre-adipocytes. Conversely , silencing of ZNF521 was found to significantly enhance the adipogenic differentiation of hADSCs. Inhibition of adipogenesis by ZNF521 was at least in part due to inhibition of EBF1. Taken together , these results confirm a role for ZNF521 as a key negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation of hADSCs.
