  The gut microbiota has an important role in the maintenance of human health and in disease pathogenesis. This importance was realized through the advent of omics technologies and their application to improve our knowledge of the gut microbial ecosystem. In particular , the use of metagenomics has revealed the diversity of the gut microbiota , but it has also highlighted that the majority of bacteria in the gut remain uncultured. Culturomics was developed to culture and identify unknown bacteria that inhabit the human gut as a part of the rebirth of culture techniques in microbiology. Consisting of multiple culture conditions combined with the rapid identification of bacteria , the culturomic approach has enabled the culture of hundreds of new microorganisms that are associated with humans , providing exciting new perspectives on host-bacteria relationships. In this Review , we discuss why and how culturomics was developed. We describe how culturomics has extended our understanding of bacterial diversity and then explore how culturomics can be applied to the study of the human microbiota and the potential implications for human health.
