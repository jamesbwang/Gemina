  Several reports demonstrated that cadmium ( Cd) had proinflammatory activities. The present study aimed to investigate whether Cd induces inflammatory cytokines in mouse placenta and human trophoblast cells. Human JEG-3 cells were treated with different concentration of CdCl TNF-Î± , IL-8 and IL-6 mRNAs were elevated in CdCl Cd induces inflammatory cytokines partially through activating Akt signaling in mouse placenta and human trophoblast cells. NAC may be exploited for prevention of Cd-induced placental
