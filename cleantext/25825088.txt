  Paclitaxel is a powerful chemotherapeutic drug , used for the treatment of many cancer types , including esophageal adenocarcinomas ( EAC). Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradation process maintaining cellular homeostasis. Defective autophagy has been implicated in cancer biology and therapy resistance. We aimed to assess the impact of autophagy on chemotherapy response in EAC , with a special focus on paclitaxel. Responsiveness of EAC cell lines , OE19 , FLO-1 , OE33 and SK-GT-4 , to paclitaxel was assessed using Alamar Blue assays. Autophagic flux upon paclitaxel treatment in vitro was assessed by immunoblotting of LC3B-II and quantitative assessment of WIP1 mRNA. Immunohistochemistry for the autophagy markers LC3B and p62 was applied on tumor tissue from 149 EAC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy , including pre- and post-therapeutic samples ( 62 matched pairs). Tumor response was assessed by histology. For comparison , previously published data on 114 primary resected EAC cases were used. EAC cell lines displayed differing responsiveness to paclitaxel treatment; however this was not associated with differential autophagy regulation. High p62 cytoplasmic expression on its own ( p â‰¤ 0.001) , or in combination with low LC3B ( p = 0.034) , was associated with nonresponse to chemotherapy , regardless of whether or not the regiments contained paclitaxel , but there was no independent prognostic value of LC3B or p62 expression patterns for EAC after neoadjuvant treatment. p62 and related pathways , most likely other than autophagy , play a role in chemotherapeutic response in EAC in a clinical setting. Therefore p62 could be a novel therapeutic target to overcome chemoresistance in EAC.
