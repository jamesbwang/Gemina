  Inorganic arsenic ( iAs) exposure increases risk of several diseases , including cancer. Some nutrients such as flavonoids enhance glutathione activity , which in turn play a key role in iAs elimination. Our objective was to explore whether dietary non-soy flavonoids are associated with iAs metabolism. We hypothesized that the intake of flavonoids belonging to the following groups , flavan-3-ols , flavone , flavonol , flavanone , and anthocyanidin , is positively associated with urinary dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA) , which is the most soluble iAs metabolite excreted. We performed a cross-sectional study that included 1027 women living in an arsenic-contaminated area of northern Mexico. Flavonoid intake was estimated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Concentration of urinary iAs and its metabolites ( monomethylarsonic acid and DMA) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography ICP-MS. Results showed positive significant associations between DMA and the flavonoid groups flava-3-ols ( β = 0.0112) and flavones ( β = 0.0144) , as well as the individual intake of apigenin ( β = 0.0115) , luteolin ( β = 0.0138) , and eriodictyol ( β = 0.0026). Our findings suggest that certain non-soy flavonoids may improve iAs elimination; however , there is still very limited information available regarding the consumption of flavonoids and iAs metabolism.
