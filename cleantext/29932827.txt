  Communion and agency are often described as core human values. In adults , these values predict gendered role preferences. Yet little work has examined the extent to which young boys and girls explicitly endorse communal and agentic values and whether early gender differences in values predict boys ' and girls ' different role expectations. In a sample of 411 children between the ages of 6 and 14 years , we found consistent gender differences in endorsement of communal and agentic values. Across this age range , boys endorsed communal values less and agentic values more than did girls. Moreover , gender differences in values partially accounted for boys ' relatively lower family versus career orientation , predicting their orientation over and above gender identification and parent reports of children 's gender expression. These findings suggest that gender differences in core values emerge surprisingly early in development and predict children 's expectations well before they make decisions about adopting adult roles in their own families.
