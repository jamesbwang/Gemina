  The lower gluteal flap is an autologous microsurgical breast reconstruction procedure using the soft tissue of the region of the gluteal sulcus. The perineal extension increases the volume of the sample. The pedicle with one artery and two large veins extends up the ischial notch and can reach 8 to 12 cm. The two operative positions , the relative shortness of the pedicle and the firm tissues transferred are balanced by the discretion of the sequelae of the donor site and the volume which is always enough even in the slim woman. The best indication of this technique is two-sided breast reconstruction but it also provides a solution in case of contraindication of other autologous flaps , especially DIEP.
