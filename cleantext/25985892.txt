  We present the statistical analysis plan of a prespecified Tranexamic Acid for Hyperacute Primary Intracerebral Haemorrhage ( TICH) -2 sub-study aiming to investigate , if tranexamic acid has a different effect in intracerebral haemorrhage patients with the spot sign on admission compared to spot sign negative patients. The TICH-2 trial recruited above 2000 participants with intracerebral haemorrhage arriving in hospital within 8 h after symptom onset. They were included irrespective of radiological signs of on-going haematoma expansion. Participants were randomised to tranexamic acid versus matching placebo. In this subgroup analysis , we will include all participants in TICH-2 with a computed tomography angiography on admission allowing adjudication of the participants ' spot sign status. Primary outcome will be the ability of tranexamic acid to limit absolute haematoma volume on computed tomography at 24 h ( Â± 12 h) after randomisation among spot sign positive and spot sign negative participants , respectively. Within all outcome measures , the effect of tranexamic acid in spot sign positive/negative participants will be compared using tests of interaction. This sub-study will investigate the important clinical hypothesis that spot sign positive patients might benefit more from administration of tranexamic acid compared to spot sign negative patients.
