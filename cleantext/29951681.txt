  A red-emitting fluorescent probe has been developed for the selective and sensitive detection of Hg2 +. With the addition of Hg2 + , the solution of probe 1 displayed a remarkable fluorescence enhancement ( 102 fold) with Î»emmax = 625 nm and a large Stokes shift ( 150 nm). The detection limit of this probe was as low as 7.1 nM based on S/N = 3. This probe exhibited a good performance in detecting Hg2 + in real water samples , living cells and organisms.
