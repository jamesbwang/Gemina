  The authors discuss principles of continuous flow left ventricular assist device ( LVAD) operation , basic differences between the axial and centrifugal flow designs and hemodynamic performance , normal LVAD physiology , and device interaction with the heart. Systematic interpretation of LVAD parameters and recognition of abnormal patterns of flow and pulsatility on the device interrogation are necessary for clinical assessment of the patient. Optimization of pump flow using LVAD parameters and echocardiographic and hemodynamics guidance are reviewed.
