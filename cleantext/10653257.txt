  Sickle cell disorders are associated with increased risk of sickling and vaso-occlusive complications when undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB) surgery. Monitoring of certain parameters such as venous and arterial oxygen content , hematocrit , acid base homeostasis , and body temperature are required for a superior outcome. Furthermore , perioperative exchange transfusion has a positive effect on the outcome of surgery and on the survival of patients undergoing heart surgery. Avoiding intraoperative hypoxia and hypothermia<symptom> , and minimizing hemoglobin S ( HbS) and hemoglobin C ( HbC) levels with exchange transfusion make bypass surgery relatively safe with enhanced outcomes in these cases. The exact HbS level for conducting cardiac surgery with CPB is not known , however , a HbS level < 30 % is considered safe for conducting CPB. By using a `` discard '' cardiotomy reservoir and priming the oxygenator reservoir with donor blood , we were able to reduce the intraoperative circulating HbS and HbC levels to less than 15 % and sequester the plasma and clotting factors from the discarded blood using intraoperative plasmapheresis.
