  Rhamnogalacturonan II ( RG-II) is a region of pectin macromolecules that is present in plant primary cell walls. RG-II can be solubilized from cell walls as a borate-RG-II complex ( B-RG-II) , where two RG-II fragments are cross-linked via a borate diester linkage. Here , a rabbit monoclonal antibody against B-RG-II was prepared , which recognized both B-RG-II and RG-II monomers without borate ester-crosslinking. A pectic fragment with unknown structure was also recognized by the antibody , but neither homogalacturonan nor rhamnogalacturonan I was recognized. Immunoelectron microscopic analyses of Arabidopsis root tip cells were performed using this antibody. The signal was detected in developing cell plates and cell walls , which were denser in longitudinal walls than in transverse walls. These results coincide with our previous results obtained in suspension cultured tobacco cells , confirming that RG-II is present in cell plates at an early stage of their assembly.
