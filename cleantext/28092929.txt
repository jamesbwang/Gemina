  Few studies have reported the prognostic value of pretreatment hemoglobin levels in patients with lung adenocarcinoma ( LA). In the present study , we retrospectively reviewed 306 LA patients for their prognosis associated with the pretreatment hemoglobin levels. Person-years and case fatality rate ( CFR) were calculated from May 2010 to June 2017. Hazard ratio ( HR) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Patients with low pretreatment hemoglobin ( LPHb) levels had a higher CFR than did patients with normal pretreatment hemoglobin ( NPHb) levels ( HR = 1.48 , 95 % CI = 1.06-2.08 , and Low pretreatment hemoglobin level was demonstrated to be an independent biomarker for poor prognosis in patients with LA.
