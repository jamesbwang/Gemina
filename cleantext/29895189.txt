  The tumor suppressor p53 is a key regulator of cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Recent studies show that the delicate balance<symptom> of p53 expression is important for neural tube defects , neuronal degeneration , embryonic lethality , as well as differentiation and dedifferentiation. Moreover , p53 showed different regulatory patterns between rodent and primate embryonic stem cells ( ESCs). However , the role of p53 and apoptosis stimulating protein of p53 ( ASPP) during neural differentiation ( ND) from primate ESCs is still unknown. In this study , using an FGF-2 and/or HGF selectively containing ND culture systems for rhesus monkey ESCs ( rESCs) , the changes of p53 and ASPPs , and p53 targets , i.e. BAX and p21 , were analyzed. Our results showed that the expression patterns of ASPP1/ASPP2 and iASPP were opposite in rESCs but similar in differentiated cells , and the expression of p53 was approximately consistent with BAX , but not p21. These findings indicate that the strong expression of iASPP in ESCs and weak expression of ASPP1/ASPP2 maintain the stability of stemness; and in ND niche , unimpaired iASPP may decrease its inhibition of ASPP1/ASPP2 expression , the interaction of p53 and ASPPs causing rESCs to convert towards a neural fate concomitant with apoptosis , but not to cell cycle arrest.
