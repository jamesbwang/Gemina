  In cirrhotic patients , a high serum creatinine value is an independent mortality factor. Similarly , it is predictive of renal insufficiency after liver transplantation , and chronic kidney disease in this situation , is also an independent mortality factor. A relevant evaluation of GFR is currently crucial , particularly in case of end-stage liver disease or liver transplant project , and is key for the decision of double liver-kidney transplantation. Serum creatinine or creatinine-based equations are the most used tools in clinical practice but they significantly overestimate renal function. Equilibrium inulin renal clearance remains the gold standard but is time consuming and expensive. Cystatin C and Cystatin C-based equations are less influenced by muscle mass or bilirubin value , but their dosage is not standardized and is expensive. Pharmacological models using exogenous markers , new kidney biomarkers , Doppler coupled with ultrasounds , and kidney histology may be interesting tools but their indications need to be specified.
