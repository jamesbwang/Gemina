  By describing 10 new patients recruited in centres for Human Genetics , we further delineate the clinical spectrum of a Crouzon-like craniosynostosis disorder , officially termed craniosynostosis and dental anomalies ( MIM614188). Singularly , it is inherited according to an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. We identified six missense mutations in IL11RA , a gene encoding the alpha subunit of interleukin 11 receptor , 4 of them being novel , including 2 in the Ig-like C2-type domain. A subset of patients had an associated connective tissue disorder with joint hypermobility and intervertebral discs fragility. A smaller number of teeth anomalies than that previously reported in the two large series of patients evaluated in dental institutes points toward an ascertainment bias.
