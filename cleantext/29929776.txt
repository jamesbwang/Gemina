  The autophagosome is a double-membrane compartment formed during autophagy that sequesters and delivers cargoes for their degradation or recycling into the vacuole. Analyses of the AuTophaGy-related ( ATG) proteins have unveiled dynamic mechanisms for autophagosome biogenesis. Recent advances in plant autophagy research highlight a complex interplay between autophagosome biogenesis and the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER): on the one hand ER serves as a membrane source for autophagosome initiation and a signaling platform for autophagy regulation; on the other hand ER turnover is connected to selective autophagy. We provide here an integrated view of ER-based autophagosome biogenesis in plants in comparison with the newest findings in yeast and mammals , with an emphasis on the hierarchy of the core ATG proteins , ATG9 trafficking , and ER-resident regulators in autophagy.
