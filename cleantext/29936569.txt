  The relationships between seizures<symptom> , neuronal death , and epilepsy remain one of the most disputed questions in translational neuroscience. Although it is broadly accepted that prolonged and repeated seizures<symptom> cause neuronal death and epileptogenesis , whether brief seizures<symptom> can produce a mild but similar effect is controversial. In the present work , using a rat pentylenetetrazole ( PTZ) model of seizures<symptom> , we evaluated how a single episode of clonic-tonic seizures<symptom> affected the viability of neurons in the hippocampus , the area of the brain most vulnerable to seizures<symptom> , and morphological changes in the hippocampus up to 1 week after PTZ treatment ( recovery period). The main findings of the study were: ( 1) PTZ-induced seizures<symptom> caused the transient appearance of massively shrunken , hyperbasophilic , and hyperelectrondense ( dark) cells but did not lead to detectable neuronal cell loss. These dark neurons were alive , suggesting that they could cope with seizure-related dysfunction. ( 2) Neuronal and biochemical alterations following seizures<symptom> were observed for at least 1 week. The temporal dynamics of the appearance and disappearance of dark neurons differed in different zones of the hippocampus. ( 3) The numbers of cells with structural and functional abnormalities in the hippocampus after PTZ-induced seizures<symptom> decreased in the following order: CA1 > CA3b , c > hilus > dentate gyrus. Neurons in the CA3a subarea were most resistant to PTZ-induced seizures<symptom>. These results suggest that even a single seizure<symptom> episode is a potent stressor of hippocampal neurons and that it can trigger complex neuroplastic changes in the hippocampus.
