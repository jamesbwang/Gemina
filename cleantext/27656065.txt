  The present study aimed to compare the remaining dentin thickness ( RDT) and fracture resistance of conventional and conservative access and biomechanical preparation in molars using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT). A total of 60 freshly extracted human molars were selected and were randomly divided into two groups of conventional and conservative access preparation group ( The mean RDT was less in conventional group than conservative group. Pericervical dentin was preserved more in conservative group. The statistical difference among both the experimental group was highly significant ( < 0.001). The mean load at fracture was less in conventional group than conservative group ( < 0.001). Coronal dentin was conserved in molars when accessed through conservative than through conventional. The dentin conservation afforded an increased resistance to fracture in conservative group which is doubled the fracture resistance in conventional group.
