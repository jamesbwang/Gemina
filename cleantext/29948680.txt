  In order to evaluate the health of Plicopurpura pansa , a species considered vulnerable , a population of this gastropod living in proximity to the port of greatest cargo movement in Mexico was monitored seasonally during 1 year. Morphometric characteristics and sexual proportion were recorded. A macroscopic analysis was carried out to detect malformations and imposex; a histological analysis was performed to evaluate disseminated and gonadal neoplasias; the presence/absence in soft tissues of butyltin species ( BTs) as possible contamination agents was also estimated. A total of 508 P. pansa specimens were collected. The largest specimens were obtained in winter. The coefficients of determination inside the port were low ( R
