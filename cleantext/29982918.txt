  The function of the chicken 's major histocompatibility complex ( MHC or B complex) class I major ( BF2) and minor ( BF1) glycoproteins is compared for their expression , ability to present viral antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs) , and interaction with natural killer ( NK) cells. MHC-restricted CTLs recognized virus antigen in the context of the BF2 * 21 major glycoprotein but not the BF1 * 21 minor glycoprotein. Marek 's disease<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( MDV) , a large DNA virus known to reduce the cell surface expression of class I glycoprotein , reduced the expression of BF2 glycoprotein while BF1glycoprotein expressions are remained as no change or slight increase. In addition , the expression of BF1 * 21 class I glycoprotein protected target cells from NK cell lysis while the expression of the BF2 * 21 class I glycoprotein enhanced NK cell lysis of target cells. Therefore , BF1 and BF2 provide two different cellular immune functions; BF1 negatively regulates the NK cell killing activity and BF2 restricts the antigen specific CTL immune response.
