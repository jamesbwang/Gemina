  Intra-operative imaging is sometimes available to assist needle biopsy , but typical open-loop insertion does not account for unmodeled needle deflection or target shift. Closed-loop image-guided compensation for deviation from an initial straight-line trajectory through rotational control of an asymmetric tip can reduce targeting error. Incorporating robotic closed-loop control often reduces physician interaction with the patient , but by pairing closed-loop trajectory compensation with hands-on cooperatively controlled insertion , a physician 's control of the procedure can be maintained while incorporating benefits of robotic accuracy. A series of needle insertions were performed with a typical 18G needle using closed-loop active compensation under both fully autonomous and user-directed cooperative control. We demonstrated equivalent improvement in accuracy while maintaining physician-in-the-loop control with no statistically significant difference ( p > 0.05) in the targeting accuracy between any pair of autonomous or individual cooperative sets , with average targeting accuracy of 3.56 mm
