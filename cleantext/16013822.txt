  TiO ₂- reduced graphene oxide composite-modified glassy carbon electrodes ( TiO ₂ ⁻ ErGO ⁻ GCE) for the sensitive detection of tartrazine were prepared by drop casting followed by electrochemical reduction. The as-prepared material was characterized by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) and X-ray diffraction ( XRD). Cyclic voltammetry and second-order derivative linear scan voltammetry were performed to analyze the electrochemical sensing of tartrazine on different electrodes. The determination conditions ( including pH , accumulation potential , and accumulation time) were optimized systematically. The results showed that the TiO ₂ ⁻ ErGO composites increased the electrochemical active area of the electrode and enhanced the electrochemical responses to tartrazine significantly. Under the optimum detection conditions , the peak current was found to be linear for tartrazine concentrations in the range of 2.0 & times; 10
