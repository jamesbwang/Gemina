  Evidence on the adverse effects of agricultural pesticide use by farmers under the actual field conditions on their peripheral nerve conduction in China is limited. This study was to investigate the association of agricultural pesticide use with the abnormalities of farmers ' peripheral nerve conduction based on two rounds of conventional nerve conduction studies. The level of pesticide exposure was assessed by measuring total amount of pesticides used by farmers in 2012. The logistic and negative binomial regression analyses were performed on a cohort study of 218 farmers. Results show that agricultural use of neither glyphosate nor non-glyphosate herbicides was not found to induce the abnormalities of farmers ' peripheral nerve conduction. However , agricultural use of organophosphorus compounds was significantly associated with increased risk of demylination disease of peripheral nerve conduction described by the reduced velocity. Moreover , the use of organonitrogen compounds by farmers would not only increase risk of demylination disease but axonal damages described by the reduced amplitude. By contrast , agricultural uses of organosulfur and pyrethroid compounds would not induce the abnormalities of farmers ' peripheral nerve conduction. The findings demonstrated the importance of developing health-friendly pesticides to replace organophosphorus and organonitrogen insecticides and fungicides in China.
