  The present study was conducted on healthy obese persons to determine: ( i) the association between total cholesterol , triglycerides , HDL cholesterol , total cholesterol/HDL ratio and fasting blood glucose ( FBG) with ( a) BMI , ( b) waist circumference ( WC) and ( c) body fat and ( ii) the presence of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes ( based on fasting blood glucose) in the participants. There were 1140 participants of both sexes ( female: male 697:443; group mean age 44.0 ± 10.8 years; BMI ≥ 25 kg/m Based on a linear regression analysis triglycerides acted as a significant predictor for body fat. Triglycerides showed a significant negative correlation with BMI and body fat. HDL cholesterol was significantly negatively correlated with waist circumference and positively correlated with body fat. Total cholesterol/HDL ratio was positively correlated with waist circumference and negatively correlated with body fat. A significant positive correlation of FBG and waist circumference was also observed. Among the healthy participants 34.2 % had pre-diabetes and 13.6 % had diabetes.
