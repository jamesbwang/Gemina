  We investigated the reversibility of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF)- associated renal decline and tubular dysfunction using different antiretroviral strategies. A successive evaluation of renal ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR)) and tubular ( phosphataemia , proteinuria<symptom> , albuminuria , phosphaturia , uricosuria , glycosuria and tubular proteinuria<symptom>) parameters was performed in 231 patients , before and after switching from TDF to abacavir ( n = 60) , using dual therapy ( n = 49) , or continuing the same regimen including TDF ( n = 122). In a successive evaluation after a median of 8.86 months , or less time if treatment was switched ( 4.8 months vs. 13.3 months to second evaluation; P < 0.01) , a significant improvement in eGFR ( median change +0.3 vs. -2.91 mL/min/1 .73 m Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate discontinuation was associated with a rapid and significant improvement in eGFR and tubular abnormalities , regardless of whether abacavir or dual therapy was chosen. Switching to a regimen that included dolutegravir and/or rilpivirine was associated with a eGFR decrease without differences in the rate of tubular dysfunction improvement in comparison with the rest of patients who discontinued tenofovir.
