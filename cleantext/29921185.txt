  CME: Adrenal Insufficiency Abstract. Patients suffering from adrenal insufficiency ( AI) often present with unspecific symptoms. Therefore , the diagnosis of AI , a potential life-threatening condition , can be missed. Lab tests , especially the ACTH-stimulation test , play a crucial role in the diagnosis of AI. According to the different etiologies , AI can be grouped into a primary ( adrenal) or central ( hypothalamic or pituitary , respectively) form. However , the most common cause is the treatment with glucocorticoids , which can lead to central AI. Patients suffering from AI are given hydrocortisone. The chronic replacement dose should be as low as possible , in acute situations , a rapid and sufficient increase of the hydrocortisone dose is necessary to prevent adrenal crisis. Replacement therapy with fludrocortisone is only necessary in patients with primary AI.
