  First-line diagnostic investigations for endometriosis are physical examination and pelvic ultrasound. The second-line investigations are: targeted pelvic examination performed by an expert clinician , transvaginal ultrasound performed by an expert physician sonographer ( radiologist or gynaecologist) , and pelvic MRI. Management of endometriosis is recommended when the disease has a functional impact. Recommended first-line hormonal therapies for the management of endometriosis-related pain are combined hormonal contraceptives ( CHCs) or the 52 mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system ( IUS). There is no evidence base on which to recommend systematic preoperative hormonal therapy solely to prevent surgical complications or facilitate surgery. After surgery for endometriosis , a CHC or 52 mg levonorgestrel-releasing IUS is recommended as first-line treatment when pregnancy is not desired. In the event of failure of the initial treatment , recurrence , or multiorgan involvement , a multidisciplinary team meeting is recommended , involving physicians , surgeons and other professionals. A laparoscopic approach is recommended for surgical treatment of endometriosis. HRT can be offered to postmenopausal women who have undergone surgical treatment for endometriosis. Antigonadotrophic hormonal therapy is not recommended for patients with endometriosis and infertility<symptom> to increase the chances of spontaneous pregnancy , including postoperatively. Fertility preservation options must be discussed with patients undergoing surgery for ovarian endometriomas.
