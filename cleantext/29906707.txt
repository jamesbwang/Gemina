  This systematic review aims to contrast levels , manifestations and associations of depression<symptom> in patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures<symptom> ( PNES) and those with epilepsy. ScienceDirect and Web of Science were searched for primary research reports describing quantitative studies involving separate epilepsy and PNES samples ( age 16 +) and using a validated measure of depression<symptom> While 34 studies were identified , most were of low quality and had small sample sizes. Studies consistently found higher levels of self-reported depression<symptom> in the PNES than epilepsy groups , with a meta-analysis demonstrating a significant difference between the groups. Although patients with PNES were also more likely to have a clinical diagnosis of depression<symptom> than those with epilepsy , the difference between the groups was less pronounced in studies based on such diagnoses rather than self-report. Patients with PNES were more likely to report physical symptoms of depression<symptom> than those with epilepsy. Interpersonal factors explained more variation in depression<symptom> levels in patients with PNES than those with epilepsy , for whom illness related factors were more influential , but in both patient groups , depression<symptom> had a significant impact on health related quality of life. This systematic review demonstrates a higher prevalence of depression<symptom> in patients with PNES compared to patients with epilepsy and suggests differences in the expression and possible causes of depression<symptom> between these groups.
