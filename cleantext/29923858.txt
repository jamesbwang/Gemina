  To evaluate the relationship between graft thickness/regularity and visual outcomes of Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty ( DSAEK). Records of post-DSAEK patients who were examined by anterior segment optical coherence tomography at `` Villa Igea '' Private Hospital ( Forlì , Italy) since April 2015 were reviewed. Pachymetric and elevation maps of both host cornea and graft were analyzed. Graft regularity was determined based on the root mean square error ( RMSE) of the graft pachymetric measurements taken 3 and 6 mm from the center and the RMSE of the corneal elevation measurements at its posterior and interface surfaces. These parameters were correlated with best-spectacle-corrected visual acuity ( BSCVA) ( expressed in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) and compared between eyes with central graft thickness ( CGT) ≥ 100 μm ( group 1) and eyes with CGT < 100 μm ( group 2). Eighty-nine post-DSAEK eyes of 89 patients with Fuchs endothelial dystrophy or bullous keratopathy and no significant comorbidities were included. There were 40 eyes ( CGT = 138.2 ± 31.7 μm) in group 1 and 49 eyes ( CGT = 73.3 ± 15.5 μm) in group 2. The RMSEs of graft pachymetry and the RMSEs of the interface and posterior surface elevation maps at 3 and 6 mm differed significantly between both groups ( P < 0.05). When only eyes with Fuchs endothelial dystrophy ( n = 54) were considered in both groups , there was a statistically significant correlation ( r = 0.44; P = 0.001) between BSCVA and CGT. DSAEK grafts thinner than 100 μm are more regular than thicker ones. In eyes with Fuchs endothelial dystrophy that are otherwise healthy , thinner grafts yield significantly better BSCVA.
