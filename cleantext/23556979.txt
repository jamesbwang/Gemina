  The brain operates in a complex way. The temporal complexity underlying macroscopic and spontaneous brain network activity is still to be understood. In this study , we explored the brain 's complexity by combining functional connectivity , graph theory , and entropy analyses in 25 healthy people using task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. We calculated the pairwise instantaneous phase synchrony between 8,192 brain nodes for a total of 200 time points. This resulted in graphs for which time series of clustering coefficients ( the `` cliquiness '' of a node) and participation coefficients ( the between-module connectivity of a node) were estimated. For these two network metrics , sample entropy was calculated. The procedure produced a number of results: ( 1) Entropy is higher for the participation coefficient than for the clustering coefficient. ( 2) The average clustering coefficient is negatively related to its associated entropy , whereas the average participation coefficient is positively related to its associated entropy. ( 3) The level of entropy is network-specific to the participation coefficient , but not to the clustering coefficient. High entropy for the participation coefficient was observed in the default-mode , visual , and motor networks. These results were further validated using an independent replication dataset. Our work confirms that brain networks are temporally complex. Entropy is a good candidate metric to explore temporal network alterations in diseases with paroxysmal brain disruptions , including schizophrenia and epilepsy.
