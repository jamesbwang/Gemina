  BACKGROUND Doctors ' empathy is closely related to patients ' health. This study aimed to examine whether patients ' stigma and self-efficacy play a mediating role in the relationship between doctors ' empathy abilities and patients ' cellular immunity in male patients with breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS Doctors ' empathy scores and patients ' demographic data , disease condition , stigma , and self-efficacy were measured. Patient T cell subset was tested at admission and 3 months after the operation and was compared by paired t test. The multivariate linear regression model was applied to analyze the factors influencing the immune index. Pearson correlation analysis and structural equation modeling were applied to explore the relationships among patients ' stigma , self-efficacy , and cellular immunity and doctors ' empathy abilities. RESULTS At the 2 time points , only the change in NK subset was statistically significant , while the changes in percentage of CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , and B cells were not statistically significant. The doctors ' empathy abilities were negatively correlated with patients ' stigma and were positively related to patients ' self-efficacy. Patients ' stigma was negatively related to NK subset , while self-efficacy was positively associated with NK subset. Patients ' stigma and self-efficacy played a mediating role in the relationship between doctors ' empathy abilities and patients ' NK subset , and stigma had a stronger effect than self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS Doctors ' empathy abilities affected breast cancer patients ' NK subset through their stigma and self-efficacy. The mental health of male breast cancer patients need more attention and empathy education needs to be improved.
