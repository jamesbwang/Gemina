  As a popular sample preparation approach , filter-aided sample preparation ( FASP) has been widely used in proteomic analysis. However , several limitations have been noted , including sample loss during filtration , repetitive centrifugation steps , and the possibility of breakage of filtration membrane. Extraction bias among different sample preparation strategies presents another challenge. To overcome these limitations and address remaining challenges , we developed a novel surfactant and chaotropic agent assisted sequential extraction/on-pellet digestion ( SCAD) protocol. The new strategy resulted in higher protein yield and improved peptide recovery and protein coverage compared to two conventional sample preparation methods ( FASP and urea). In combination of three strategies , more than 10,000 distinct protein groups were identified with 1 % FDR from MDA-MB-231 cells without any prefractionation. This in-depth proteome analysis was accomplished by optimization of protein extraction , enzymatic digestion , LC gradient , and peptide sequencing method. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis ( IPA) of proteins exclusively identified in SCAD revealed several crucial signaling pathways that regulate breast cancer progression. SCAD also enabled an unbiased extraction of different categories of proteins ( membrane , intracellular , nuclear) associated with tumorigenesis , which integrates the advantages of FASP and urea extraction. This novel strategy expedites comprehensive protein identification , which is applicable for biomarker discovery in various types of cancers.
