  On-line and real-time analysis of micro-organ activity permits to use the endogenous analytical power of cellular signal transduction algorithms as biosensors. We have developed here such a sensor using only a few pancreatic endocrine islets and the avoidance of transgenes or chemical probes reduces bias and procures general usage. Nutrient and hormone-induced changes in islet ion fluxes through channels provide the first integrative read-out of micro-organ activity. Using extracellular electrodes we captured this read-out non-invasively as slow potentials which reflect glucose concentration-dependent ( 3-15 mM) micro-organ activation and coupling. Custom-made PDMS-based microfluidics with platinum black micro-electrode arrays required only some tens of islets and functioned at flow rates of 1-10 µl/min which are compatible with microdialysis. We developed hardware solutions for on-line real-time analysis on a reconfigurable Field-Programmable Gate Array ( FPGA) that offered resource-efficient architecture and storage of intermediary processing stages. Moreover , real-time adaptive and reconfigurable algorithms accounted for signal disparities and noise distribution. Based on islet slow potentials , this integrated set-up allowed within less than 40 μs the discrimination and precise automatic ranking of small increases ( 2 mM steps) of glucose concentrations in real time and within the physiological glucose range. This approach shall permit further development in continuous monitoring of the demand for insulin in type 1 diabetes as well as monitoring of organs-on-chip or maturation of stem-cell derived islets.
