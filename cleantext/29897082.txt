  p-Type doping in wide bandgap and new classes of ultra-wide bandgap materials has long been a scientific and engineering problem. The challenges arise from the large activation energy of dopants and high densities of dislocations in materials. We report here , a significantly enhanced p-type conduction using high-quality AlGaN nanowires. For the first time , the hole concentration in Mg-doped AlGaN nanowires is quantified. The incorporation of Mg into AlGaN was verified by correlation with photoluminescence and Raman measurements. The open-circuit potential measurements further confirmed the p-type conductivity , while Mott-Schottky experiments measured a hole concentration of 1.3 × 1019 cm-3. These results from photoelectrochemical measurements allow us to design prototype ultraviolet ( UV) light-emitting diodes ( LEDs) incorporating the AlGaN quantum-disks-in-nanowire and an optimized p-type AlGaN contact layer for UV-transparency. The ∼ 335 nm LEDs exhibited a low turn-on voltage of 5 V with a series resistance of 32 Ω , due to the efficient p-type doping of the AlGaN nanowires. The bias-dependent Raman measurements further revealed the negligible self-heating of devices. This study provides an attractive solution to evaluate the electrical properties of AlGaN , which is applicable to other wide bandgap nanostructures. Our results are expected to open doors to new applications for wide and ultra-wide bandgap materials.
