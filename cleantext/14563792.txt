  The Modified Merle d'Aubigne-Postel Score and the Harris Hip Score are commonly used to assess the functional outcomes after acetabular fractures. A previous report showed that correlation between scores is good , that there is poor concordance among functional classes , and that the distribution of the scores is highly asymmetrical. Several issues were not addressed in this report , mainly that the data set was treated as transversal data without comparison of scores through time; therefore the objective of this article is to assess the degree of correlation and concordance between the Modified Merle d'Aubigne-Postel Score and the Harris Hip Score during the first 9 months after acetabular fracture treatment. Both scores were recorded in a cohort of 23 previously healthy patients after 3 , 6 and 9 months after fixation of acetabular fractures. Through a mixed-effects repeated measures model , we assessed differences between standardized scores. Pearson 's interclass correlation coefficients for full scores and each of their domains , as well as agreement for clinical graduation classification was calculated. Between score correlation was 89 %. We found no differences between scores at 3 , 6 and 9 month follow-ups. Agreement between scores was 0.95 , while agreement for clinical graduation classification was 0.67. Very short term correlation and concordance between scores is excellent , while concordance for clinical graduation classification is modest. We suggest the widespread use of the simpler score.
