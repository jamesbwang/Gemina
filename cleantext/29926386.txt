  CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling has been implicated in breast carcinogenesis , and genetic polymorphisms in these molecules have been associated with different types of cancer. The present study analyzed genetic polymorphisms in CXCL12 ( rs1801157 , G > A) and CXCR4 ( rs2228014 , C > T) and CXCR4 immunostaining in tumor tissues from patients with triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC) aiming to evaluate their possible role in its ' susceptibility and prognosis. Genetic polymorphisms were analyzed in 59 TNBC patients and 150 control women; age-adjusted logistic regression showed no association when variants were considered in isolation; however , a statistically significant interaction was noted for heterozygosis for both allelic variants increasing the odds for TNBC ( CXCL12-GA by CXCR4-CT: OR 7.23; 95 % CI 1.15-45.41; p = 0.035). CXCL12 polymorphism was correlated negatively with proliferation index ( Ki67) ( Tau-b =- 0.406; p = 0.006). CXCR4 immunostaining was evaluated in 37 TNBC patients ( 22 with paired tumor-normal adjacent tissue). CXCR4 was detected more intensely in cell cytoplasm than in membrane , and was more expressed in tumor than in normal adjacent tissues , although not statistically significant. CXCR4 expression on the membrane of tumor cells was correlated positively with histopathological grade ( Tau-b = 0.271; p = 0.036) and negatively with lymph node metastasis ( Tau-b =- 0.478; p = 0.036). The present study indicates that CXCL12 and CXCR4 polymorphisms and CXCR4 immunostaining might have susceptibility and prognostic roles in TNBC pathogenesis.
