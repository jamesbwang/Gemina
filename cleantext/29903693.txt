  Cardiogenic shock<symptom> ( CS) is a major challenge in contemporary cardiology. Despite a better understanding of the pathophysiology of CS , its management has only improved slightly. The prevalence of CS has remained stable over the past decade , but its outcome has seen few improvements , with the 1-month mortality rate still in the range of 40-60 %. Inotropes and vasopressors are the first-line therapies for CS , but they are associated with significant hazards , and have well-known deleterious effects. Furthermore , a significant number of patients develop refractory CS with haemodynamic instability , causing critical organ hypoperfusion and/or pulmonary<symptom> congestion<symptom> , despite increasing doses of catecholamines. A major change has resulted from the recent advent and availability of potent mechanical circulatory support ( MCS) devices. These devices , which ensure sustained blood flow , provide a great and long-awaited opportunity to improve the prognosis of CS. Several efficient MCS devices are now available , including left ventricle-to-aorta circulatory support devices and full pulmonary and circulatory support with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. However , evidence to support their indications , the timing of implantation and the selection of patients and devices is scarce. Because these devices are gaining momentum and are becoming readily available , the `` Unit√© de Soins Intensifs de Cardiologie '' group of the French Society of Cardiology aims to propose practical algorithms for the use of these devices , to help intensive care unit and cardiac care unit physicians in this complex area , where evidence is limited.
