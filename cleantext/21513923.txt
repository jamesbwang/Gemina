  The efficacy and safety of combining open-configuration magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) and an optical surgical navigation system ( OSNS) for guidance of percutaneous liver cryoablation were evaluated in a pig model. This approach was successfully executed in eight test pigs under general anesthesia. Another two pigs spared from ablation served as controls. MRI studies , blood testing , and pathologic examinations were performed at various time points. MRI-determined minimal and maximal cryolesion diameters were 19.4 ± 1.5 mm and 44.3 ± 1.8 mm , respectively ( mean volume , 8.32 ± 2.41 cm
