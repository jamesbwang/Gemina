  Germline mutations involving small mothers against decapentaplegic-transforming growth factor-β ( SMAD-TGF-β) signaling are an important but rare cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH) , which is a disease characterized , in part , by vascular<disease> fibrosis<disease> and hyperaldosteronism ( ALDO). We developed and analyzed a fibrosis<disease> protein-protein network ( fibrosome) in silico , which predicted that the SMAD3 target neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated 9 ( NEDD9) is a critical ALDO-regulated node underpinning pathogenic vascular<disease> fibrosis<disease>. Bioinformatics and microscale thermophoresis demonstrated that oxidation of Cys
