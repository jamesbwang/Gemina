  Microtubules ( MTs) are polymers assembled from αβ-tubulin heterodimers that display the hallmark behavior of dynamic instability. MT dynamics are driven by GTP hydrolysis within the MT lattice , and are highly regulated by a number of MT-associated proteins ( MAPs). How MAPs affect MTs is still not fully understood , partly due to a lack of high-resolution structural data on undecorated MTs , which need to serve as a baseline for further comparisons. Here we report three structures of MTs in different nucleotide states ( GMPCPP , GDP , and GTPγS) at near-atomic resolution and in the absence of any binding proteins. These structures allowed us to differentiate the effects of nucleotide state versus MAP binding on MT structure. Kinesin binding has a small effect on the extended , GMPCPP-bound lattice , but hardly affects the compacted GDP-MT lattice , while binding of end-binding ( EB) proteins can induce lattice compaction ( together with lattice twist) in MTs that were initially in an extended and more stable state. We propose a MT lattice-centric model in which the MT lattice serves as a platform that integrates internal tubulin signals , such as nucleotide state , with outside signals , such as binding of MAPs or mechanical forces , resulting in global lattice rearrangements that in turn affect the affinity of other MT partners and result in the exquisite regulation of MT dynamics.
