  Surgical management of aortic valve infective endocarditis<disease> ( IE) with cryopreserved homograft<disease> has been associated with lower risk of recurrent IE , but there is equipoise with regard to the optimal prosthesis. This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to compare outcomes between homograft<disease> and conventional prosthesis for aortic valve IE. We searched MEDLINE database to September 2017 for studies comparing homograft<disease> versus conventional prosthesis. The main outcomes were all-cause mortality , recurrent IE , and reoperation. There were 18 included comparative observational studies with 2232 patients ( median follow up = 5 ( interquartile range: 2-7) years , 30 % prosthetic valve endocarditis<disease> four studies were adjusted for baseline differences. There were no differences in perioperative mortality or stroke despite a greater proportion of staphylococcal endocarditis<disease> , abscess<disease> , and root replacements but less multivalve involvement in the homograft<disease> group. Long-term outcomes of all-cause mortality ( incidence rate ratio ( IRR) = 1.03 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) = 0.81-1.31 , P = 0 .83 , for unmatched , and IRR = 0.82 , 95 % CI = 0.36-1.84 , P = 0.63 , for matched studies) , recurrent endocarditis<disease> ( IRR = 1.01 , 95 % CI = 0.53-1.93 , P = 0.96 , for unmatched , and IRR = 1.04 , 95 % CI = 0.49-2.19 , P = 0.92 , for matched studies) , and reoperation ( IRR = 1.60 , 95 % CI = 0.80-3.21 , P = 0.18 , for unmatched , and IRR = 3.17 , 95 % CI = 0.52-19.44 , P = 0.21 , for matched studies) were not different comparing homograft<disease> versus conventional prosthesis. There was a significantly increased need for reoperation with homograft<disease> versus mechanical prosthetic valves , but this comparison was based on limited data. Homografts<disease> and conventional prostheses offer similar survival and freedom from recurrent endocarditis<disease> and reoperation for aortic valve IE. Homografts<disease> may be associated with greater risk of reoperation compared with mechanical valves.
