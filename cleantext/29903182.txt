  In order to have a basic understanding of the neglect condition of rural children aged 12 to 17 years old of Tujia and Miao minorities in Wuling mountainous area as well as its causes. According to the principle of multistage stratified cluster samplingmethod , a total of 1974 students of eight middle schoolsfrom rural areas in four counties of Tujia-Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Xiangxi had been selected from November to December in 2014 ( 1020 students from Tujia minority and 954 students from Miao minority). In addition , by adopting themethod of `` The Normal Value of Evaluation on the Neglect of Middle School Students from 12 to 17 Years Old in Rural China '' , the neglect rate and degree can reflect how often and how strong children in rural areas have been neglected. Also , relative factors of the neglect was analyzed by logistic multi-factor regression analysismethod. The total neglect rate of children in rural areas from 12 to 17 years old of Tujia and Miao minorities was 67. 83 % ( 1339/1974). The proportion of male students which was 70. 42 % ( 631/896) was higher than the female students counterpart , which was 65. 68 % ( 708/1078) ( χ ~ 2 = 5. 053 , P < 0. 05). The total neglect degree was ( 54. 96 ± 10. 31) , and the degree of children between 12 and 14 years old ( 55. 45 ± 9. 51) was higher than that of children between 15 and 17 years old ( 54. 54 ± 10. 95) ( t = 1. 980 , P < 0. 05). The neglect rate and degree in medication for female students were higher than male students ( χ ~ 2 = 10. 233 , P < 0. 01 , t = 2. 139 , P < 0. 05) , while the neglect rate and degree in education and the neglect degree in security male students had a higher rate and a more severe degree than female students ( χ ~ 2 = 3. 969 , t = 1. 989 , t = 2. 014 , P < 0. 05). In addition to the neglect of education , the neglect rate and degree of other aspects for children of Tujia and Miao minorities in rural areas had statistical significance ( P < 0. 05). The neglect rate of left-behind children was higher than that of un-left-behind children in physical and medical aspects ( χ ~ 2 = 6. 267 , χ ~ 2 = 4. 040 , P < 0. 05). As theresult of logistic multi-factor regression analysis showed , male students ( OR = 1. 292 , 95 % CI 1. 062-1. 573) , children who have less intimate relationship with parents ( OR = 1. 344 , 95 % CI 1. 009-1. 791 , OR = 1. 475 , 95 % CI 1. 063-2. 046) , whose parents do not share a close relationship ( OR = 1. 396 , 95 % CI 1. 042-1. 870) , those without a single room ( OR = 0. 577 , 95 % CI 0. 464-0. 719) were more likely to be neglected. Children of Tujia and Miao minorities in Wuling mountainous area are under a serious neglecting state , and the main influencing factors are whether children have single rooms , the relationship between children and parents and the relationship between parents.
