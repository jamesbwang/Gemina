  WNK lysine-deficient protein kinase 4 ( WNK4) is an important regulator of renal salt handling. Mutations in its gene cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type II , mainly arising from overactivation of the renal NaCl cotransporter NCC. In addition to full-length WNK4 , we have observed faster migrating bands ( between 95 and 130 kDa) in Western blots of kidney lysates. Therefore , we hypothesized that these could correspond to uncharacterized WNK4 variants. Here , using several WNK4 antibodies and WNK4
