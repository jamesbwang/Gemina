  This study was conducted to investigate the reliability and validity of the Korean version of Autism-Spectrum Quotient ( AQ). 20 participants with high-functioning autism ( HFA) and 99 normal participants were recruited. All participants were completed the AQ and Empathy Quotient ( EQ) , and parents of the HFA group completed the parent-report AQ. For testing the reliability , we examined Cronbach 's alpha , performed item analysis , and compared self versus parent report score of HFA participants. For testing the validity , we compared the difference of the score of AQ among HFA and control group using independent t-tests , and performed correlation analysis between AQ and EQ. The receiver operation characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine a cut-off. The Korean version of the AQ exhibited adequate internal consistency , and in most items , the HFA group scored higher in comparison to the control group. It was demonstrated that AQ has good discriminant validity through the confirmation of the significant difference in the AQ score between two groups. The concurrent validity was established through the significant correlation between AQ and EQ in the HFA group. The best estimate cut-off score of AQ for screening was 23. The Korean version of the AQ was determined as a reliable and valid instrument to assess HFA in Korean population.
