  The current state of antibiotic discovery , research and development is insufficient to respond to the need for new treatments for drug-resistant bacterial infections. The process has changed over the last decade , with most new agents that are in Phases 1-3 , or recently approved , having been discovered in small- and medium-sized enterprises or academia. These agents have then been licensed or sold to large companies for further development with the goal of taking them to market. However , early drug discovery and development , including the possibility of developing previously discontinued agents , would benefit from a database of antibacterial compounds for scrutiny by the developers. This article describes the first free , open-access searchable database of antibacterial compounds , including discontinued agents , drugs under pre-clinical development and those in clinical trials: AntibioticDB ( AntibioticDB.com). Data were obtained from publicly available sources. This article summarizes the compounds and drugs in AntibioticDB , including their drug class , mode of action , development status and propensity to select drug-resistant bacteria. AntibioticDB includes compounds currently in pre-clinical development and 834 that have been discontinued and that reached varying stages of development. These may serve as starting points for future research and development.
