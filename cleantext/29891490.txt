  Current treatments for castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC) largely fall into two major classes; AR-targeted therapies such as the next-generation anti-androgen therapies ( NGATs) , enzalutamide and abiraterone , and taxanes such as docetaxel and cabazitaxel. Despite improvements in outcomes , patients still succumb to the disease due to the development of resistance. Further complicating the situation is lack of a well-defined treatment sequence and potential for cross-resistance between therapies. We have developed several models representing CRPC with acquired therapeutic resistance. Here , we utilized these models to assess putative cross-resistance between treatments. We find that resistance to enzalutamide induces resistance to abiraterone and vice versa but resistance to neither alters sensitivity to taxanes. Acquired resistance to docetaxel induces cross-resistance to cabazitaxel but not to enzalutamide or abiraterone. Correlating responses with known mechanisms of resistance indicates that androgen receptor ( AR) variants are associated with resistance to NGATs while the membrane efflux protein ABCB1 is associated with taxane resistance. Mechanistic studies show that AR variant-7 ( AR-v7) is involved in NGAT resistance but not resistance to taxanes. Our findings suggest the existence of intra cross-resistance within a drug class ( i.e. , within NGATs or within taxanes) , while inter cross-resistance between drug classes does not develop. Furthermore , our data suggests resistance mechanisms differ between drug classes. These results may have clinical implications by showing that treatments of one class can be sequenced with those of another , but caution should be taken when sequencing similar classed drugs. Additionally , the development and use of biomarkers indicating resistance will improve patient stratification for treatment.
