  Presence of pelvic fractures in trauma patients has previously been related to high mortality. However , there are controversies on whether pelvic fractures are the underlying cause of death or if it is rather an indicator of injury severity. We aimed to assess whether the presence of pelvic fracture increased mortality among a cohort of trauma patients or if it was simply an indicator of severe injury. Karolinska University Hospital is the largest trauma centre in Sweden. The hospital is linked to the Swedish National Trauma Registry , `` SweTrau ''. Registry data was collected for the period January 2013 until December 2015 with a one year further follow-up regarding mortality. Patients in the pelvic fracture group were compared to the non-pelvic fracture group and regression analysis was performed adjusting for factors that could possibly affect mortality. Univariable analysis showed that pelvic fracture was associated with an increased mortality , OR 2.4 ( CI 1.3-3.4). Multivariable analysis showed that the presence of a pelvic fracture was not associated with an increased 30-day mortality ( OR 0.5 , CI 0.2-0.9) , while factors as Shock<symptom> ( OR 7.1 , CI 4.6-10.9) , GCS < 9 ( OR 6.2 , CI 3.9-9.8) , ISS > 15 ( OR 12.4 , CI 8.1-18.9) , Age > 60 ( OR 3.2 , CI 2.1-4,9) and ASA 3-4 ( OR 4.7 , CI 3.1-7.3) were associated with an increased 30-day mortality. Factors affecting 1-year mortality was analysed in the same way and the results were similar. Presence of pelvic fractures in trauma patients is not correlated to increased mortality when adjusted for Age , ISS , ASA , GCS and
