  Rosiglitazone has been proposed as a treatment strategy for type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) , could provide robust glucose-lowering capability with risk of cardiovascular events. We thus did a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials to assess the effect of this treatment on glycaemic control , cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM. We systematically search PubMed , Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials comparing rosiglitazone to other anti-diabetic treatments. These studies included randomized controlled trials ( RCTs) , cohort studies , and case-control studies that had treatment at least 6 months of follow-up in patients with T2DM. We aimed to evaluate the long-term effect on cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone compared with basal insulin drug. Main outcomes included myocardial infarction , heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , stroke , cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality. We included 11RCTs and 4 observational studies involving 20,079 individuals with T2DM allocated to rosiglitazone and a similar number to comparison groups of which only five compared rosiglitazone with placebo and collected data on cardiovascular outcomes. Among patients with T2DM , the rosiglitazone is associated with a significantly increased risk of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , with little increased risk of myocardial infarction , without a significantly increased risk of stroke , cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality compared with placebo or active controls. Alternative methods to reduce the uncertainty in long-term pragmatic evaluations , inclusion of rosiglitazone in factorial trials , publication of cardiovascular outcome data from adverse event reporting in trials of rosiglitazone and a cardiovascular endpoint trial of rosiglitazone among people without diabetes.
