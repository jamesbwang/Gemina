  Approximately 15.5 % of global forest<disease> is controlled by ~ 1 billion local people and the area under community control is increasing. However , there is limited empirical evidence as to whether community control is effective in providing critical global ecosystem services , such as biodiversity conservation and carbon storage. We assess the effectiveness of one example of community-controlled forest<disease> , Nepal 's Community Forestry Program ( CFP) , at providing biodiversity conservation and carbon storage. Using data from 620 randomly selected CFP and non-CFP forest<disease> plots , we apply a robust matching method based on covariates to estimate whether CFPs are associated with greater biodiversity conservation or carbon storage. Our results reveal a significant positive effect of CFP on biodiversity , which is robust against the influence of unobserved covariates. Our results also suggest a significant negative effect of the CFP on aboveground tree and sapling carbon ( AGC) at the national scale ( -15.11 Mg C ha-1). However , the CFP has a mixed effect on carbon across geographic and topographic regions and in forests with different canopy covers. Though there were no significant effects of the CFP on AGC at lower altitudes , in the Terai or hill regions , and under closed canopies , there were positive effects in open canopies ( 25.84 Mg C ha-1) at lower slopes ( 25.51 Mg C ha-1) and negative effects at higher altitudes ( -22.81 Mg C ha-1) and higher slopes ( -17.72 Mg C ha-1). Our sensitivity analysis revealed that the positive effects are robust to unobserved covariates , which is not true for the negative results. In aggregate , our results demonstrate that CFP can be an effective forest<disease> management strategy to contribute to global ecosystem services such as biodiversity , and to a lesser extent carbon.
