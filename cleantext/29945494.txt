  The estimated global prevalence of Peripheral artery disease ( PAD) increased by 24 % in span of 10 years ( 2000-2010) from 164 to 202 million. Despite scarcity of data on PAD in sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA) and the Caribbean , estimates for PAD from these regions may be helpful for health-care providers. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 quantified health loss from hundreds of diseases using systematic reviews and multilevel computer modeling. Estimated rates with 95 % uncertainty intervals ( UI) for PAD ( ICD-10 I70 .2) were examined for SSA and the Caribbean and compared to high-income North<pathogen> America ( HINA). Disability-adjusted life years ( DALYs) are years of healthy life lost representing total disease burden by combining years of life lost and years lived disabled. In 2015 , estimated age-standardized DALYs per 100,000 due to PAD for males were as follows: Caribbean ( 34 , UI: 29-39) , HINA ( 36 , UI: 30-42) , and SSA ( 20 , UI: 14-30). In contrast , DALYs in females were as follows: Caribbean ( 25 , UI: 20-30) , HINA ( 28 , UI: 22-36) , and SSA ( 17 , UI: 11-26). For both sexes combined , the rate in Southern SSA was 55 ( 46-67). This reflects the extremely high rates in South Africa ( males 90 , UI: 77-107; females 63 , UI: 53-75). Estimated rate of DALYs per 100,000 was lowest in SSA. Within SSA , the rate in South Africa was highest , exceeding even HINA. Caribbean rates were intermediate.
