  Paraesophageal hiatal hernia repair can be performed with or without mesh reinforcement. The use , technique , and mesh type remain controversial because of mixed reports on mesh-related complications. Short-term outcomes have become important in all forms of surgery. From January 2012 through April 2017 , all patients who underwent isolated hiatal hernia repair in our center were reviewed. Concomitant bariatric surgery cases were excluded. Repairs reinforced by porcine urinary bladder matrix ( UBM) graft were compared to non-UBM repairs. Statistical comparison was based on a Wilcoxon 2-sample test or Fisher 's exact test. We reviewed 239 charts; 110 bariatric cases and 8 cases with non-UBM reinforcement were excluded. We identified 121 patients: 56 UBM-reinforced ( 46.3 %) versus 65 non-UBM ( 53.7 %). Sixteen ( 28.6 %) UBM cases were male versus 23 ( 35.4 %) non-UBM cases. The UBM patients were significantly older ( 63.9 versus 54.3; Hiatal hernia repair with UBM reinforcement can be performed safely with no increase in postoperative complications.
