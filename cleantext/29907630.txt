  To analyse the clinical features , systemic associations , treatment and visual outcomes of uveitis in children from a referral centre in São Paulo , Brazil. Clinical records of patients under 16 years old who attended the Uveitis Service , Hospital das Clinicas , Faculdadede Medicina , Universidade de São PauloFMUSP , between April and September 2017 , were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with incomplete medical records , previous ocular trauma , or less than six6 months of follow-up were excluded. Thirty-nine children ( 25 female/14 male) were included. There was predominance of bilateral ( 89.7 %) , asymptomatic ( 56.4 %) and recurrent/chronic cases ( 84.6 %). The mean age at study inclusion was 10.7 ± 3.4 years ( range 3-16 years). Improvement or preservation of visual acuity ( VA) was observed in 27 patients ( 84 %); VA was not informed in 8 patients. Patients were referred early to tertiary centre ( 55 % within 6 months of uveitis diagnosis). Anterior uveitis was the most common involvement ( 46 %) , followed by intermediate uveitis ( 26 %). Juvenile idiopathic arthritis<disease> ( JIA)- associated uveitis ( 41 %) and immune-mediated intermediate uveitis ( 25.6 %) were the principal non-infectious conditions; ocular toxoplasmosis<disease> ( 7.7 %) and toxocariasis ( 5.1 %) were the most common infectious conditions. Ocular complications were observed at first visit in 46 % of patients and in 90 % during final evaluation. Oral prednisone , immunosuppressive therapy ( IMT) and/or biologic agents were used in all non-infectious conditions ( 32 children , 82 %); IMT and/or biologic agents were used in all patients with JIA-associated uveitis and in 50 % of patients with immune-mediated intermediate uveitis. Paediatric patients with uveitis are referred early to this centre and , although severe , adequate management with systemic IMT may preserve VA..
