  The prevalence of salmonellae in the intestines of the invasive suckermouth catfish Hypostomus plecostomus was assessed in the San Marcos River , just down-stream of its spring-fed headwaters. In 2014 , H. plecostomus , sediment , and water samples were collected during 15 sampling events. A combination of semi-selective enrichment and quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR) revealed the presence of salmonellae in 45 % of the fish intestines across the entire year , with a prevalence range of 13-100 % per sampling event. Repetitive element sequence-based PCR ( rep-PCR) and multi-locus sequence typing ( MLST) revealed a high diversity of salmonellae from fish intestine samples at individual sampling times , single or multiple presence of rep-PCR patterns and serotypes within individual fish , and identical rep-PCR patterns and serotypes for different fish within and across sampling events. Overall , 15 serotypes were identified by MLST , with a diversity range between one and seven serotypes per sampling event. Some serotypes were retrieved only once , while others were detected more frequently. A few serotypes were retrieved at several sampling times , nearly evenly distributed over the entire sampling period. Prevalence and diversity were independent of precipitation events , indicating the potential presence of environmental strains that are capable of long-term persistence in the environment.
