  We aimed to explore the effects of low energy availability ( EA) ( 15 kcal · kg lean body mass ( LBM) By using a crossover design , ten eumenorrheic women ( VO In D-RES , P1NP concentrations at D6 decreased by 17 % ( BASE: 54.8 ± 12.7 μg · L Low EA achieved through dietary energy restriction resulted in a significant decrease in bone formation but no change in bone resorption , whereas low EA achieved through exercise energy expenditure did not significantly influence bone metabolism. Both low EA conditions elicited significant and similar changes in hormone concentrations.
