  In biological tissues , it is now well-understood that mechanical cues are a powerful mechanism for pattern regulation. While much work has focused on interactions between cells and external substrates , recent experiments suggest that cell polarization and motility might be governed by the internal shear stiffness of nearby tissue , deemed `` plithotaxis ''. Meanwhile , other work has demonstrated that there is a direct relationship between cell shapes and tissue shear modulus in confluent tissues. Joining these two ideas , we develop a hydrodynamic model that couples cell shape , and therefore tissue stiffness , to cell motility and polarization. Using linear stability analysis and numerical simulations , we find that tissue behavior can be tuned between largely homogeneous states and patterned states such as asters , controlled by a composite `` morphotaxis '' parameter that encapsulates the nature of the coupling between shape and polarization. The control parameter is in principle experimentally accessible , and depends both on whether a cell tends to move in the direction of lower or higher shear modulus , and whether sinks or sources of polarization tend to fluidize the system.
