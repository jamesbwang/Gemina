  Evolutionary processes are driven by diverse molecular mechanisms that act in the creation and prevention of mutations. It remains unclear how these mechanisms are regulated because limitations of existing mutation assays have precluded measuring how mutation rates vary over time in single cells. Toward this goal , I detected nascent DNA mismatches as a proxy for mutagenesis and simultaneously followed gene expression dynamics in single
