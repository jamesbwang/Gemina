  In the United States , routine human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>) vaccination is recommended for females and males at age 11 or 12 years; the series can be started at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females through age 26 years and males through age 21 years. The objective of this study was to assess the health impact and cost-effectiveness of harmonizing female and male vaccination recommendations by increasing the upper recommended catch-up age of HPV<pathogen> vaccination for males from age 21 to age 26 years. We updated a published model of the health impact and cost-effectiveness of 9-valent human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> vaccine ( 9vHPV). We examined the cost-effectiveness of ( 1) 9vHPV for females aged 12 through 26 years and males aged 12 through 21 years , and ( 2) an expanded program including males through age 26 years. Compared to no vaccination , providing 9vHPV for females aged 12 through 26 years and males aged 12 through 21 years cost an estimated $ 16,600 ( in 2016 U.S. dollars) per quality-adjusted life year ( QALY) gained. The estimated cost per QALY gained by expanding male vaccination through age 26 years was $ 228,800 and ranged from $ 137,900 to $ 367,300 in multi-way sensitivity analyses. The cost-effectiveness ratios we estimated are not so favorable as to make a strong economic case for recommending expanding male vaccination , yet are not so unfavorable as to preclude consideration of expanding male vaccination. The wide range of plausible results we obtained may underestimate the true degree of uncertainty , due to model limitations. For example , the cost per QALY might be less than our lower bound estimate of $ 137,900 had our model allowed for vaccine protection against re-infection. Models that specifically incorporate men who have sex with men ( MSM) are needed to provide a more comprehensive assessment of male HPV<pathogen> vaccination strategies.
