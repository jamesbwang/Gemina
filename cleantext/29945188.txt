  Understanding the mutational processes that act during cancer development is a key topic of cancer biology. Nevertheless , much remains to be learned , as a complex interplay of processes with dependencies on a range of genomic features creates highly heterogeneous cancer genomes. Accurate driver detection relies on unbiased models of the mutation rate that also capture rate variation from uncharacterised. Here , we analyze patterns of observed-to-expected mutation counts across 505 whole cancer genomes , and find that genomic features missing from our mutation-rate model likely operate on a megabase length scale. We extend our site-specific model of the mutation rate to include the additional variance from these sources , which leads to robust significance evaluation of candidate cancer drivers. We thus present ncdDetect v. 2 , with greatly improved cancer driver detection specificity. Finally , we show that ranking candidates by their posterior mean value of their effect sizes offers an equivalent and more computationally efficient alternative to ranking by their p-values. ncdDetect v. 2 is implemented as an R-package and is freely available at http://github.com/TobiasMadsen/ncdDetect2. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
