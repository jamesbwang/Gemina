  Acquired von Willebrand syndrome<disease> ( VWS) due to loss of high-molecular-weight multimers ( HMWMs) has been reported with longer term mechanical devices and is associated with mucosal bleeding , a primary hemostasis type of bleeding. However , little is known whether a similar defect occurs in patients with short-term mechanical circulatory support ( STMCS) devices. We reviewed von Willebrand factor ( VWF) profiles in patients with STMCS devices who underwent VWS workup from December 2015 to March 2017 at an academic quaternary care hospital. There were a total of 18 patients ( 57.0 ± 12.7 years old; 83.3 % male) including nine with mucosal bleeding and nine with decreasing hemoglobin. The STMCS devices included Impella ( n = 11) , Impella and right ventricular assist device ( n = 2) , and an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator ( n = 5). The mean HMWM by quantitative VWF multimer analysis was 3.6 % ± 1.3 % ( normal cutoff: 18-34 %). In all 10 cases in which VWF activity , fibrinogen , factor VIII , or VWF antigen level were obtained , they were either normal or elevated. All cases demonstrated high normal or elevated levels of low molecular weight multimers ( LMWMs). These findings are consistent with type 2 VWS ( qualitative defect). This is the first study that quantitatively describes STMCS device-associated HMWM loss , which may contribute to mucosal bleeding. This finding may have implications for intraoperative management during implantation of longer term devices or heart transplantation or other surgery while on STMCS.
