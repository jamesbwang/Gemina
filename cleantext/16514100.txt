  This study aimed to investigate the cerebral small vessel disease ( SVD) , an intrinsic disorder of the brain 's perforating arterioles , which could cause serious cognitive decreasing and trigger dementia. In this study , we present a multi-step computational approach to construct a functional SVD long non-coding RNA ( lncRNA)- mediated ceRNA network ( LMCN) by integrating genome-wide lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles , miRNA-target interactions , and functional analyses. We used hypergeometric test to evaluate enrichment significance of miRNAs and we obtained the LMCN , which contained 27 lncRNAs , 7,229 mRNA , and 28,871 lncRNAs-mRNA interrelationship pairs. What 's more , co-expression analysis was utilized to constructe a competitive endogenous RNAs ( ceRNAs) interaction network which comprised of 21 lncRNAs , 129 mRNAs and 141 interaction pairs. We determined that metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 and MIR155 host gene acted synergistically to regulate mRNAs in a network module of the competitive LMCN. Moreover , 7 genes were obtained through Gene Ontology enrichment. In addition , 29 mRNA enriched pathways significantly associated with lncRNAs was obtained via Fisher test. In conclusion , we identified 7 potential lncRNAs and 29 possible lncRNA-mediated pathways associated with SVD. Thus , ceRNAs could accelerate biomarker discovery and therapeutic development in SVD.
