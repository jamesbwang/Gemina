  Some theories predict habitat specialists should be less dispersive and migratory than generalists , while other theories predict the opposite. We evaluated the cross-species relationship between the degree of habitat specialization and dispersal and migration status in 101 bird species breeding in North<pathogen> America and the United Kingdom , using empirical estimates of the degree of habitat specialization from breeding bird surveys and mean dispersal distance estimates from large-scale mark-recapture studies. We found that habitat specialists dispersed farther than habitat generalists , and full migrants had more specialized habitat than partial migrants or resident species. To our knowledge this is the first large-scale , multi-species study to demonstrate a positive relationship between the degree of habitat specialization and dispersal , and it is opposite to the pattern found for invertebrates. This finding is particularly interesting because it suggests that trade-offs between the degree of habitat specialization and dispersal ability are not conserved across taxonomic groups. This cautions against extrapolation of trait co-occurrence from one species group to another. In particular , it suggests that efforts aimed at conserving the most habitat-specialist temperate-breeding birds will not lead to conservation of the most dispersal-limited species.
