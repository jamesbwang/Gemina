  In general , a colloidal method employing polyvinylpyrrolidone ( PVP) as the stabilizer has been proven particularly suitable for preparing Pd nanoparticles ( Pd-NPs) with controlled morphology and size. However , this surfactant will seriously cover the Pd-NP surface , which is detrimental for catalytic activity. In this paper , we reported a method to remove PVP from the carbon nanotube ( CNT) supported Pd nanocubes ( Pd-NCs) and Pd nanooctahedra ( Pd-NOs) by steam treatment in a lab-made reactor. We found that this method can not only efficiently remove PVP from the Pd-NP surface , but also can well maintain the original structure of Pd-NCs and Pd-NOs , dramatically enhancing the catalytic performance. The present approach may promote potential applications of Pd-NPs prepared by colloidal methods in catalytic fields.
