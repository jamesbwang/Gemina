  A recent outbreak of measles<pathogen> in Okinawa Prefecture , Japan ended with 33 measles<pathogen> cases whose symptoms were masked because of insufficient protection against the disease ( modified measles<pathogen>). Using quantitative modelling , we determined the transmission potential of measles<pathogen> by clinical presentation ( classic vs modified measles<pathogen>). We found low ascertainment probabilities among modified measles<pathogen> cases , indicating that intensified public health interventions that specifically target this group should be implemented to better contain outbreaks with modified measles<pathogen> cases.
