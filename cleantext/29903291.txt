  To evaluate the toxic effect of vehicle exhaust ( VE) on lung epithelial cells by air-liquid interface ( ALI) method in vitro , and analyze the different toxicity of VE after being treated with 0. 2 μm filter. VE were collected using20 liter Tedlar bags and their particulate matter ( PM) number , surface and mass concentration were measured by particle size spectrometer for the interference of 0. 2 μm filter or non-filter. Four groups were included , which divided into blank control group , clean air group , filtered VE exposure group , non-filtered VE exposure group. The blank control group did not do any treatment; the clean air group was an artificial gas containing21 % O_2 and 79 % N_2; the filtered VE group ( marked as f VE) was filtered using a 0. 2μm particle filter for VE. The VE group was used VE directly collected by air bag and marked as non-f VE. Except the blank control group , BEAS-2B cells were treated with clean air or VE by ALI method at a flow rate of 25 mL/min , 37 ℃ for 60 min in vitro. Cell relative viability was evaluated by CCK-8 assay. The reactive oxygen species ( ROS) generation was determined via flow cytometry with 2 ' , 7 '- dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate ( DCFH-DA) probe. Apoptosis and necrosis<symptom> rate were measured using the commercial kit of Annexin V-FITC/PI by flow cytometry. In the non-f VE group , the PM of number , surface and mass concentration for 0. 5-10 μm diameters were 0. 24 × 10 ~ 3N/cm ~ 3 , 0. 29 × 10 ~ 3μm ~ 2/cm ~ 3 and 0. 19 μg/m ~ 3 , respectively , and for the PM of 10-500 nm diameters , they were 56 × 10 ~ 3N/cm ~ 3 、 34. 53 × 10 ~ 8nm ~ 2/cm ~ 3 and 95ng/m ~ 3 , respectively. The PM of 0. 5-10 μm diameters in f VE group , their number , surface and mass concentration were less than 1 N/cm ~ 3 , 1 μm ~ 2/cm ~ 3 0. 001 μg/m ~ 3 , respectively. After filtration , the number , surface and mass concentration of PM in 10-500 nm diameters reduced by 89. 79 % , 93. 57 % and 90. 55 % , respectively , as compared with non-f VE. In the clean air group , the cell relative viability , ROS generation , early apoptosis rate and late apoptosis and necrosis<symptom> rate were ( 90. 15 ± 4. 25) % , ( 1. 92 ± 0. 34) × 10 ~ 5 , ( 1. 09 ± 0. 48) % and ( 8. 93 ± 3. 31) % , respectively. Compared with the clean air group , the cell relative viability , the ROS generation and the late apoptosis and necrosis<symptom> rate of the two VE exposure groups were significantly different ( all P < 0. 05). The cell relative viability of f VE exposure group were significantly higher than that in the non-f VE exposure group ( t = 6. 331 , P < 0. 001) , and had no significant difference about the ROS generation ( f VE ∶ non-VE =-LRB- 2. 94 ± 0. 21) × 10 ~ 5 ∶ ( 3. 32 ± 0. 49) × 10 ~ 5 , t = -1. 252 , P = 0. 279) , early apoptosis rate ( f VE ∶ non-VE =-LRB- 1. 09 ± 0. 30) % ∶ ( 0. 99 ± 0. 10) % , t = 0. 708 , P = 0. 497) and late apoptosis and necrosis<symptom> rate ( f VE ∶ non-VE =-LRB- 21. 75 ± 10. 37) % ∶ ( 15. 32 ± 2. 74) % , t = 1. 347 , P = 0. 242) between f VE and nonf VE exposure group ( all P > 0. 05). Increased toxicity of human lung cells ( BEAS-2B) in vitro were observed by ALI method at a flow rate of 25 mL/min , 37 ℃ for60 min. After using a 0. 2 μm filter , the toxicity was obviously decreased.
