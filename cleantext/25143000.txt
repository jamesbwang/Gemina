  BACKGROUND We investigated whether microRNA-155-5p is involved in the differentiation of bone<disease> marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( BMSCs) into alveolar type II epithelial ( AT II) cells by regulating the Wnt signaling pathway , thus participating in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome<disease> ( ARDS). MATERIAL AND METHODS Serum levels of microRNA-155-5p in 50 ARDS patients and 50 normal controls were detected by quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR). Marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( MCSs) were isolated from mouse bone<disease> marrow and identified by flow cytometry. Subsequently , the effect of microRNA-155-5p on differentiation of BMSCs into AT II cells was evaluated by detecting the expression levels of AT II-specific genes. The expression levels of proteins in the Wnt signaling pathway after overexpression or knockdown of microRNA-155-5p were detected by Western blot. RESULTS Serum levels of microRNA-155-5p in ARDS patients were significantly higher than that in normal controls. Expression levels of AT II-specific genes were enhanced after downregulating microRNA-155-5p in BMSCs. MicroRNA-155-5p overexpression showed the opposite result. Furthermore , microRNA-155-5p inhibited the expression levels of proteins in the Wnt signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS MicroRNA-155-5p can attenuate the differentiation of BMSCs into AT II cells by inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway , thus promoting the progression of ARDS.
