  The establishment of size and shape remains a fundamental challenge in biological research that planarian flatworms uniquely epitomize. Planarians can regenerate complete and perfectly proportioned animals from tiny and arbitrarily shaped tissue pieces; they continuously renew all organismal cell types from abundant pluripotent stem cells , yet maintain shape and anatomy in the face of constant turnover; they grow when feeding and literally degrow when starving , while scaling form and function over as much as a 40-fold range in body length or an 800-fold change in total cell numbers. This review provides a broad overview of the current understanding of the planarian stem cell system , the mechanisms that pattern the planarian body plan and how the interplay between patterning signals and cell fate choices orchestrates regeneration. What emerges is a conceptual framework for the maintenance and regeneration of the planarian body plan on basis of the interplay between pluripotent stem cells and self-organizing patterns and further , the general utility of planarians as model system for the mechanistic basis of size and shape.
