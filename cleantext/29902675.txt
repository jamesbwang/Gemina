  The NUCLEAR FACTOR-Y ( NF-Y) families of transcription factors are important regulators of plant development and physiology. Though NF-Y regulatory roles have recently been suggested for numerous aspects of plant biology , their roles in flowering time , early seedling development , stress responses , hormone signaling , and nodulation are the best characterized. The past few years have also seen significant advances in our understanding of the mechanistic function of the NF-Y , and as such , increasingly complex and interesting questions are now more approachable. This review will primarily focus on these developmental , physiological , and mechanistic roles of the NF-Y in recent research.
