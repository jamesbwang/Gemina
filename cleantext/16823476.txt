  Circulating adiponectin levels are lower in individuals with increased BMI and central adiposity. However , they are paradoxically higher in those with peripheral adiposity. We hypothesized that adiponectin secretion from central and peripheral adipose tissue depots may be associated with adiposity levels and its distribution. A total of 55 subjects ( 69 % women) undergoing elective abdominal surgery ( mean age: 53 ± 13 years) were recruited. Health history , anthropometrics , and cardiovascular disease risk factor measurements were obtained. Subcutaneous adipose tissue ( SAT) and visceral adipose tissue ( VAT) samples were obtained and cultured. Media was collected after 24 hr and adiponectin released into the medium was measured using ELISA. We found that mean adiponectin levels from SAT and VAT in all subjects were 17.14 ± 15.27 vs. 15.21 ± 14.28 pg/ml/mg of tissue respectively ( p = ns). However , adiponectin secretion from VAT correlated negatively with BMI ( r = -0.31 , p = 0.01) , whereas there was no relationship with SAT ( r = 0.08 p = 0.61). Similarly , waist circumference and estimated VAT percentage were both negatively correlated with VAT secretion of adiponectin ( r = -0.35 , p = 0.01 and r = -0.36 , p = 0.02 respectively). These negative correlations were significant only in women on gender-stratified analyses. Adiponectin secretion from VAT decreases with increases in adiposity , while SAT secretion remains unchanged , especially in women. This observation may explain lower circulating adiponectin levels in individuals with central obesity. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanism behind this discrepant adiponectin secretion from SAT and VAT with increases in BMI , particularly among women.
