  Extracellular vesicles ( EVs) , including exosomes , microvesicles , and apoptotic bodies , play an important role in cellular communication during skeletal growth and homeostasis. Bioactive molecules carried by EVs are transported to neighboring and distant cells to trigger a series of signaling cascades influencing bone homeostasis. The bioactive activities of osteoclast-derived EVs include regulation of osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast-osteoblast communication. As osteoclast-derived EVs have the potential to regulate osteoclasts and osteoblasts , their application in osteoporosis and other bone metabolic disorders is currently under investigation. However , very few reviews of osteoclast-derived EVs in bone remodeling regulation have yet been published. This article aims to review recent advances in this field , summarizing a new regulator of osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast-osteoblast communication mediated by osteoclast-derived EVs. We will analyze the major challenges in the field and potential for the therapeutic application of EVs.
