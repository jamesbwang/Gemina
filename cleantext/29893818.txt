  Term and preterm parturition are associated with oxidative stress ( OS)- induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK)- mediated fetal tissue ( amniochorion) senescence. p38MAPK activation is a complex cell and stimulant-dependent process. Two independent pathways of OS-induced p38MAPK activation were investigated in amnion epithelial cells ( AECs) in response to cigarette smoke extract ( CSE: a validated OS inducer in fetal cells: 1) The OS-mediated oxidation of apoptosis-signaling kinase ( ASK) -1 bound Thioredoxin ( Trx ( SH) 2 dissociates this complex , creating free and activated ASK1-signalosome and 2) transforming growth factor mediated activation of ( TGF)- beta-activated kinase ( TAK) 1 and TGF-beta-activated kinase 1-binding protein ( TAB) 1. AECs isolated from normal term , not-in-labor fetal membranes<symptom> increased p38MAPK in response to CSE and downregulated it in response to antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. In AECs , both Trx and ASK1 were localized; however , they remained dissociated and not complexed , regardless of conditions. Silencing either ASK1 or its downstream effectors ( MKK3/6) did not affect OS-induced p38MAPK activation. Conversely , OS increased TGF-beta 's release from AECs and increased phosphorylation of both p38MAPK and TAB1. Silencing of TAB1 , but not TAK1 , prevented p38MAPK activation , which is indicative of TAB1-mediated autophosphorylation of p38MAPK , an activation mechanism seldom seen. OS-induced p38MAPK activation in AECs is ASK1-Trx signalosome-independent and is mediated by the TGF-beta pathway. This knowledge will help to design strategies to reduce p38MAPK activation-associated pregnancy risks.
