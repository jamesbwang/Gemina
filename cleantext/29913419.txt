  Newly emerged two-dimensional material , black phosphorus ( BP) shows promising applications in many fields owing to its superior properties. Despite the biological effects of BP were studied , its environmental impacts have not yet received enough attention. In this study , the bacterial toxicity of exfoliated BP nanosheets was for the first time evaluated against two model bacteria strains , Gram-negative Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> ( E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>) and Gram-positive Bacillus<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> ( B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen>). By monitoring the bacterial growth curve and colony counting , the bacterial toxicity of BP nanosheets was examined. Higher toxicity was induced for Gram-negative E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> compared to Gram-positive B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> after 6 h treatment , which was reversed at 12 h due to membrane self-healing of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen>. The bacterial toxicity followed a time- and concentration-dependent fashion , with a maximum bactericidal efficiency of 91.65 % and 99.69 % for E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> and B.<pathogen> subtilis<pathogen> , respectively , after 12 h exposure. Reactive oxygen species ( ROS)- dependent oxidative stress and membrane damage were the main bactericidal mechanisms as proved by fluorescence microscopy , flow cytometry , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , and Lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) assay. This study indicates the potential environmental risk of BP nanosheets and the data from this work will guide their safety applications in the future.
