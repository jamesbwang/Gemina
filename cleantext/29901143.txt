  The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective role of hyperoxia liquid in regulating cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB) induced myocardial damage and its possible underlying mechanism. In the CPB‑induced rat model , hyperoxia liquid enhanced left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) , reduced the left ventricular internal dimension systole ( LVIDs) level , inhibited malondialdehyde levels , increased superoxide dismutase , glutathione ( GSH) and GSH peroxidase levels , suppressed heart cell apoptosis , and induced the nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 ( Nrf2) and heme oxygenase‑1 ( HO‑1) signaling pathway. Then , ML385 , a Nrf2 inhibitor , was used to attenuate the effect of hyperoxia liquid on LVEF and LVIDs levels , oxidative stress and heart cell apoptosis in the CPB‑induced rat model. Collectively , the results of the present study demonstrated that the protective role of hyperoxia liquid may regulate oxidative stress in a CPB‑induced rat model through the Nrf2‑antioxidant response element signaling pathway.
