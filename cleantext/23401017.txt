  To investigate the effect of additional semiautomatic intermittent pneumatic compression device ( IPCD) in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) of lower extremity in these patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery , when compared with the conventional graduated compression stockings alone. The data of 112 patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery were retrospectively analyzed. 51 patients who ever received IPCD and graduated compression stockings during major orthopedic surgery were taken as the experimental group , and 61 patients who only received the conventional graduated compression stockings during surgery were taken as the observation group. The Doppler sonography was utilized to detect the presence of DVT and pulmonary embolism pre- and postoperatively. Besides , the mean and peak velocity of blood flow in femoral vein were recorded before and after surgery. And then , the comparisons between the two groups were made , respectively. When compared with the conventional graduated compression stockings alone , the intraoperative application of IPCD and stockings contributed the significant reduction of DVT ( 3.92 % , 2/51 versus 9.84 % , 6/61 , X Intraoperative application of IPCD could promote blood circulation of lower limbs , and significantly decrease the incidence of potentially fatal DVT in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery , when compared with the conventional graduated compression stockings.
