  Bivalent chromatin domains containing repressive H3K27me3 and active H3K4me3 modifications are barriers for the expression of lineage-specific genes in ES cells and must be resolved for the transcription induction of these genes during differentiation , a process that remains largely unknown. Here , we show that Asf1a , a histone chaperone involved in nucleosome assembly and disassembly , regulates the resolution of bivalent domains and activation of lineage-specific genes during mouse ES cell differentiation. Deletion of Asf1a does not affect the silencing of pluripotent genes , but compromises the expression of lineage-specific genes during ES cell differentiation. Mechanistically , the Asf1a-histone interaction , but not the role of Asf1a in nucleosome assembly , is required for gene transcription. Asf1a is recruited to several bivalent promoters , partially through association with transcription factors , and mediates nucleosome disassembly during differentiation. We suggest that Asf1a-mediated nucleosome disassembly provides a means for resolution of bivalent domain barriers for induction of lineage-specific genes during differentiation.
