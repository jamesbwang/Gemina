  In eusocial insect colonies , workers have individual preferences for performing particular tasks. Previous research suggests that these preferences might be associated with worker reproductive potential; however , different studies have yielded inconsistent results. This study constitutes the first comparison of foraging preferences between genetically similar normal and rebel honeybee workers , which present different reproductive potential. We found that rebels , which have a higher reproductive potential than normal workers , displayed a delayed onset of foraging and a stronger tendency to collect nectar compared with normal workers. These results support the hypothesis that workers with high reproductive potential invest more in their own egg laying and avoid risky tasks such as foraging. In contrast , the results do not support the hypothesis that reproductive workers initiate foraging earlier in life than normal workers and specialize in pollen foraging.
