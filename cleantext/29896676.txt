  Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV) is one of the most widespread human pathogens. EBV infection is usually asymptomatic , and it establishes life-long latent infection. EBV latent infection sometimes causes various tumorigenic diseases , such as EBV-related lymphoproliferative diseases , Burkitt lymphomas , Hodgkin lymphomas , NK/T-cell lymphomas , and epithelial carcinomas. EBV-encoded latent genes are set of viral genes that are expressed in latently infected cells. They include virally encoded proteins , noncoding RNAs , and microRNAs. Different latent gene expression patterns are noticed in different types of EBV-infected cells. Viral latent gene products contribute to EBV-mediated B cell transformation and likely contribute to lymphomagenesis and epithelial carcinogenesis as well. Many biological functions of viral latent gene products have been reported , making difficult to understand a whole view of EBV latency. In this review , we will focus on latent gene functions that have been verified by genetic experiments using EBV mutants. We will also summarize how viral latent genes contribute to EBV-mediated B cell transformation , Burkitt lymphomagenesis , and epithelial carcinogenesis.
