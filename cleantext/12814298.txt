  This review offers an integration of dark leadership styles with dark personality traits. The core of dark leadership consists of Three Nightmare Traits ( TNT)- leader dishonesty , leader disagreeableness , and leader carelessness-that are conceptualized as contextualized personality traits aligned with respectively ( low) honesty-humility , ( low) agreeableness , and ( low) conscientiousness. It is argued that the TNT , when combined with high extraversion and low emotionality , can have serious ( `` explosive '') negative consequences for employees and their organizations. A Situation-Trait-Outcome Activation ( STOA) model is presented in which a description is offered of situations that are attractive to TNT leaders ( situation activation) , situations that activate TNT traits ( trait activation) , and the kinds of outcomes that may result from TNT behaviors ( outcome activation). Subsequently , the TNT and STOA models are combined to offer a description of the organizational actions that may strengthen or weaken the TNT during six career stages: attraction , selection , socialization , production , promotion , and attrition. Except for mainly negative consequences of the TNT , possible positive consequences of TNT leadership are also explored , and an outline of a research program is offered that may provide answers to the most pressing questions in dark leadership research.
