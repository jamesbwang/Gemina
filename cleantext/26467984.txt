  Control of early postoperative pain entails the use of various medications including acetaminophen , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors , tramadol , and opioids. However , these medications should be carefully administered in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory<disease> disease<disease> because some medications may trigger adverse reactions after maxillofacial surgeries. The goal of postoperative pain control in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory<disease> disease<disease> is to eliminate pain without complications. Local anesthesia is an efficient tool for the control of postoperative pain after maxillofacial surgeries. We utilized a transdermal drug delivery system , iontophoresis by alternating current , in order to develop an alternative technique for administering local anesthetic to control postoperative pain in 2 patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory<disease> disease<disease>. A visual analogue scale was used to objectively measure the severity of pain. A 55-year-old woman who underwent mandibular wisdom tooth extraction and an 18-year-old woman who underwent sagittal split ramus osteotomy of the mandible both complained of pain multiple times. After application of iontophoresis , the visual analogue scale score was reduced to zero and postoperative pain could be controlled. There were no adverse events such as bronchospasm or skin irritation after the application of iontophoresis by alternating current.
