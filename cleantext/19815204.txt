  Maternal and perinatal mortality<pathogen> in Mozambique were declining at a slow pace<pathogen> , despite progress<pathogen> in coverage<pathogen> of institutional childbirth<pathogen>. Implementation<pathogen> of quality<pathogen> emergency<pathogen> obstetric care<pathogen> including vacuum<pathogen> extraction<pathogen> remained inadequate. In 2015-2017 , Tete Province achieved remarkable progress<pathogen> in improving emergency<pathogen> obstetric<pathogen> care<pathogen> and reversing the underutilisation<pathogen> of vacuum<pathogen> extraction<pathogen> , with encouraging results<pathogen> for maternal and perinatal outcomes<pathogen> , despite severe resource<pathogen> constraints<pathogen>. This paper<pathogen> presents the experience<pathogen> of Tete<pathogen> Province<pathogen> , generating a rich , contextualised understanding<pathogen> , which might provide generalizable insights<pathogen> and lessons<pathogen>. This qualitative study<pathogen> design<pathogen> is used to present Tete<pathogen> 's experience<pathogen> in improving emergency<pathogen> obstetric<pathogen> care<pathogen> and reversing the underutilisation<pathogen> of vacuum<pathogen> extraction<pathogen> , drawing on principles<pathogen> from implementation<pathogen> science<pathogen> and applying a systems<pathogen> thinking approach<pathogen>. Sources<pathogen> include routine data<pathogen> , documents<pathogen> , social media<pathogen> messages<pathogen> , and the lived experience<pathogen> of the authors<pathogen> , all intimately involved in the implementation<pathogen> process<pathogen> during 2014-2017. Iterative learning<pathogen> and analysis<pathogen> , involving all authors<pathogen> , led to the final interpretations<pathogen>. Within a context<pathogen> of severe resource<pathogen> constraints<pathogen> , Tete<pathogen> applied 4 interventions<pathogen> ( training<pathogen> , accreditation<pathogen> , audit<pathogen> , monitoring<pathogen> and evaluation<pathogen> with feedback<pathogen>) to improve the implementation<pathogen> of emergency<pathogen> obstetric<pathogen> care<pathogen>. Considerable progress<pathogen> was achieved in vacuum<pathogen> extraction<pathogen> and other signal<pathogen> functions<pathogen> of emergency<pathogen> obstetric<pathogen> care<pathogen> and in the decision-making process<pathogen> for caesarean sections<pathogen> , contributing to important reductions<pathogen> in the provincial institutional maternal mortality<pathogen> and stillbirth<pathogen> rates<pathogen>. Facilitating factors<pathogen> include attributes<pathogen> of the vacuum<pathogen> extraction<pathogen> itself , of the structural and organisational environments<pathogen> in which it was introduced , of the people<pathogen> involved in implementation<pathogen> , and of the process<pathogen> through which the implementation<pathogen> was rolled-out. The lessons<pathogen> from implementation<pathogen> science<pathogen> and systems<pathogen> thinking can contribute to surprising results<pathogen> in the improvement<pathogen> of emergency<pathogen> obstetric<pathogen> care<pathogen> including the use<pathogen> of vacuum<pathogen> extraction<pathogen> , even in a severely resource-constrained setting<pathogen>. The creation<pathogen> of conditions<pathogen> for real change<pathogen> , with empowerment<pathogen> of the staff<pathogen> and managers<pathogen> at the front-line<pathogen> of day-to-day practice<pathogen> in Tete may inspire others<pathogen> in similar conditions<pathogen> and circumstances<pathogen>. The underutilisation<pathogen> of vacuum<pathogen> extraction<pathogen> in middle- and low-income countries<pathogen> is indeed a missed opportunity<pathogen>. Its reversion<pathogen> is possible and provides a good chance<pathogen> to make considerable difference<pathogen> in maternal and perinatal
