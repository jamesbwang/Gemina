  Muay Thai kickboxing is a full-contact combat sport with a high incidence of head trauma , yet little is known about these athletes ' concussion knowledge and attitudes. This study aims to describe and quantify concussion knowledge , attitudes , and reporting intention among adult competitive Muay Thai kickboxing athletes. This cross-sectional study comprised 193 competitive Muay Thai kickboxing athletes aged â‰¥ 18 years registered with the Thai Boxing Association Sanctioning Authority. The mean concussion knowledge score was 19.5 ( SD 2.3) out of 25 , the mean concussion attitudes score was 62.7 ( SD 7.4) out of 75 , and 134 ( 69.4 %) of respondents indicated that they were likely to report concussion symptoms. No significant predictors of concussion knowledge , attitudes , or reporting intention were revealed. Competitive Muay Thai kickboxing athletes appear to have reasonably good concussion knowledge , attitudes , and reporting intention; however , there is still room for further improvement. It is recommended that concussion education programs based on current best evidence are made available to all kickboxing athletes and coaches.
