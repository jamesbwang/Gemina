  Scattering techniques are applied to studying the structural features of ganglioside aggregates in solution. Here it is described how different probing radiations allow to access different structural and dynamical parameters on different lengthscales. Besides a brief but comprehensive description of the scattering measurements , several practical suggestions are given concerning the experiments and the data analysis.
