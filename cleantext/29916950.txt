  The impact of obesity on pediatric Crohn 's disease ( CD) remains poorly characterized. We aimed to evaluate disease related outcomes in overweight and obese children with CD , compared to normal weight children. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children with newly diagnosed CD enrolled in the ImproveCareNow ( ICN) Network. Patients were stratified into normal weight , overweight and obese groups using standardized weight percentiles. A total of 898 children were included , with 87 children ( 10 %) being overweight and 43 children ( 5 %) being obese; baseline characteristics were similar between groups. There was no significant difference in number of visits in remission over 1 year between normal weight , overweight and obese children. At 1 year follow-up , nutritional status , growth status , or medication use also did not differ between groups. Hence , obesity does not appear to adversely impact Crohn 's disease outcomes in children with newly diagnosed Crohn 's disease in the first year after diagnosis.
