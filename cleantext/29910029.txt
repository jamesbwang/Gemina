  Oysters are a diverse group of marine bivalves that inhabit coastal systems of the world 's oceans , providing a variety of ecosystem services , and represent a major socioeconomic resource. However , oyster reefs have become inevitably impacted from habitat destruction , overfishing , pollution and disease outbreaks that have pushed these structures to the break of extinction. In addition , the increased frequency of climate change related events promise to further challenge oyster species survival worldwide. Oysters ' early embryonic development is likely the most vulnerable stage to climate change related stressors ( e.g. salinity and temperature shifts) as well as to pollutants ( e.g. arsenic) , and therefore can represent the most important bottleneck that define populations ' survival in a changing environment. In light of this , the present study aimed to assess two important oyster species , Crassostrea angulata and Crassostrea gigas embryo-larval development , under combinations of salinity ( 20 , 26 and 33) , temperature ( 20 , 24 and 28 °C) and arsenic ( As) exposure ( 0 , 30 , 60 , 120 , 240 , 480 , 960 and 1920 μg.
