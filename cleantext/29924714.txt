  How patterns of covariance in motor output and neural activity emerge over the course of learning is a topic of ongoing investigation. Vaidya et al. ( J Neurophysiol 119: 1291-1304 , 2018) investigate the emergence of patterns of covariance in the motor output and neural activity in chronically amputated macaques learning reach-to-grasp movements with a brain-machine interface. The authors ' findings have implications for uncovering general principles of how neural coordination unfolds while learning a different motor behavior.
