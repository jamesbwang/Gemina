  Aging is inevitable , and our society must deal with the consequences: namely , an increased incidence of disease and ill health. Many mouse models of disease are acute or early onset or are induced in young mice , despite the fact that aging is a significant risk factor for a range of significant diseases. To improve modeling of such diseases , we should incorporate aging into our models. Many systems are affected by aging , with a decline in mitochondrial function , an increase in senescence , a loss of resilience , telomere shortening , and a decline in immune function being key factors in the increased susceptibility to disease that is associated with aging. To develop novel models of age-related disease , we undertook a phenotype-driven screen of a pipeline of mutagenized mice. Here , we describe some of the underlying protocols and outline important aspects to consider when studying aged mice. Â© 2018 by John Wiley & Sons , Inc..
