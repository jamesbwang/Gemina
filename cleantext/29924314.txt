  Older adults are often considered at risk for social isolation. Little is known , however , about how often older adults lack social contact ( in person , phone , electronic) throughout the day , the implications of lacking contact ( i.e. , solitude) , and whether the effects of solitude vary by the broader social context. Participants were from the Daily Experiences and Well-being Study ( DEWS) which included 313 older adults ( aged 65 +) who completed baseline interviews followed by 5-6 days of ecological momentary assessments approximately every 3 hr. Individuals reported having no social contact ( i.e. , solitude) on 11 % of the occasions. Solitude predicted lower negative and positive affect on those occasions. The solitude-negative affect link varied by social network quality. Solitude predicted lower negative affect among individuals with more conflictual social networks but not among those with less conflictual networks. Overall , solitude may serve as an adaptive strategy for individuals embedded in demanding or irritating social contexts.
