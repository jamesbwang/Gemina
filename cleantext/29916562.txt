  The increase in the average life expectancy entails elderly and chronic patients as hospital users , often dependents and requiring recurrent hospitalizations. In this framework , an innovative model of care management is essential to ensure appropriateness and sustainability of health services. A highly specialized care-related prevention-treatment-rehabilitation approach in which pharmacological , surgical , physical and intellectual disability therapies coexist in a synergistic manner , is the answer to this new emerging need. It offers interdisciplinary care pathways facing both disease and disability recognized by severity through ICD and ICF. Measuring functional status related quality of life is a main outcome to be primarily pursued for complicated chronic patients. The implementation of `` need-adapted '' pathways agreed within multidisciplinary teams is the key feature of this new clinical model that can take advantage of data mining tools combining medical know-how and diagnostic information.
