  Nuclear organization has an important role in determining genome function; however , it is not clear how spatiotemporal organization of the genome relates to functionality. To elucidate this relationship , a method for tracking any locus of interest is desirable. Recently clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated protein 9 ( Cas9) or transcription activator-like effectors were adapted for imaging endogenous loci; however , they are mostly limited to visualization of repetitive regions. Here , we report an efficient and scalable method named SHACKTeR ( Short Homology and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Knock-in of a TetO Repeat) for live cell imaging of specific chromosomal regions without the need for a pre-existing repetitive sequence. SHACKTeR requires only two modifications to the genome: CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of an optimized TetO repeat and its visualization by TetR-EGFP expression. Our simplified knock-in protocol , utilizing short homology arms integrated by polymerase chain reaction , was successful at labeling 10 different loci in HCT116 cells. We also showed the feasibility of knock-in into lamina-associated , heterochromatin regions , demonstrating that these regions prefer non-homologous end joining for knock-in. Using SHACKTeR , we were able to observe DNA replication at a specific locus by long-term live cell imaging. We anticipate the general applicability and scalability of our method will enhance causative analyses between gene function and compartmentalization in a high-throughput manner.
