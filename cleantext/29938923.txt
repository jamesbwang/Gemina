  Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor ( MITF) is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper ( bHLH-Zip) family and functions as the master regulator of the melanocytic lineage. MITF-M is the predominant isoform expressed in melanocytes and melanoma cells , and , unlike other MITF isoforms , it is constitutively nuclear. Mutational analysis revealed three karyophilic signals in the bHLH-Zip domain of MITF-M , spanning residues 197-206 , 214-217 , and 255-265. Structural characterization of the MITF protein showed that basic residues within these signals are exposed for interactions in the absence of DNA. Moreover , our data indicate that neither DNA binding nor dimerization of MITF-M are required for its nuclear localization. Finally , dimerization-deficient MITF-M mutants exhibited a significantly reduced stability in melanoma cells when compared to the wild-type protein. Taken together , we have shown that , in addition to its well-established role in DNA binding and dimer formation , the bHLH-Zip domain of MITF modulates the transcription factor 's subcellular localization and stability.
