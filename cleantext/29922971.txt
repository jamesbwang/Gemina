  β-Galactosidase is an essential enzyme for the metabolism of lactose in human beings and has an important role in the treatment of lactose intolerance ( LI). β-Galactosidase expressed by intestinal microflora , such as lactic acid bacteria ( LAB) , also alleviates LI. A promising approach to LI management is to exploit a food-grade LAB delivery system that can inhabit the human intestine and overproduce β-galactosidase. In this study , we constructed a food-grade β-galactosidase surface display delivery system and then integrated into the chromosome of Lactococcus<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> ( L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen>) NZ9000 using recombination. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed that β-galactosidase was expressed on the cell surface of recombinant L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> stain NZ-SDL. The whole-cell biocatalyst exhibits V
