  Bacterial ghosts ( BGs) can be generated by the controlled expression of the PhiX174 lysis gene E in gram-negative bacteria. They are intriguing vaccine candidates since ghosts retain functional antigenic cellular determinants often lost during traditional inactivation procedures. Here we prepared Edwardsiella<pathogen> tarda<pathogen> ghost ( ETG) and tested different concentrations in vaccination trials. The results showed that serum IgM antibody titers were significantly higher in three different concentration immunization groups than control group ( P < 0.05) , However , there was no significant ( P > 0.05) difference between the immunized groups. The phagocytic percentage ( PP) was significantly higher ( P < 0.05) in ETG immunized groups than in the control group from 3 days post-treatment. The PP continued to rise with time until day 21 , when the values of three ETG immunized groups were 45.7 % ,51.2 % and 50.7 % , respectively. In addition , phagocytic index ( PI) was significantly higher ( P < 0.05) in ETG immunized groups than in the control group after 7 days post-treatment. However , there was no significant ( P > 0.05) difference of PP or PI between immunized groups. In addition , non-specific immune immunity , such as acid phosphatase , alkaline phosphatase , superoxide dismutase and lysozyme activities displayed a similar pattern in all immunized groups , all immunized fish showed significantly higher activities than control group fish ( P < 0.05). Most importantly three ETG immunized groups were all significantly more protected against the E.<pathogen> tarda<pathogen> challenge ( 19/25 , 76 % survival) , ( 21/25 , 84 % survival) and ( 20/25 , 80 % survival) respectively , compared to ( 9/25 , 36 % survival) survival in the control group , but there was no significant ( P > 0.05) difference of survival rate ( SR) or relative percent survival ( RPS) between immunized groups. All these results suggest that an ETG could stimulate cellular and humoral immunity , and could be used as a vaccine candidate in S.m.. In summary , ETG can protect fish from Edwardsiellosis , and there is no significant difference in SR and RPS when three different concentrations of ETG are used , so it can easily be developed as a vaccine for mechanical and artificial operations.
