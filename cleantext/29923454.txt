  CRISPR-Cas systems are a highly effective immune mechanism for prokaryotes , providing defense against invading foreign DNA. By definition , all CRISPR-Cas systems have short repeats interspersing their spacers. These repeats play a key role in preventing cleavage of self DNA and in the integration of new spacers. Here we focus on the phenomenon of repeat modularity , namely the unexpectedly high degree of repeat conservation across different systems within a genome or between different species. We hypothesize that modularity can be beneficial for CRISPR-Cas containing organisms , because it facilitates horizontal acquisition of `` pre-immunized '' CRISPR arrays and allows the utilization of spacers acquired by one system for use by other systems within the same cell.
