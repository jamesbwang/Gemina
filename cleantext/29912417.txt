  To identify a novel plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene in Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> isolated from chickens in China. WGS was used to identify a novel colistin resistance gene. The transferability of plasmids carrying mcr-7.1 was investigated by conjugation experiments. The expression of the mcr-7.1 gene was examined using an expression vector. A novel plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-7.1 , sharing 70 % amino acid identity with the mcr-3 gene , was identified in three K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> strains isolated from chickens in China. The mcr-7.1 gene was found in an IncI2-type plasmid ( pSC20141012) that co-harboured the blaCTX-M-55 gene in one isolate. pSC20141012 can be transferred from K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> SC20141012 to Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> J53Azr , exhibiting a â‰¥ 8-fold increase in colistin MIC compared with the recipient E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> J53Azr. We identified a novel plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene named mcr-7.1 in K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> in China. The prevalence of mcr-7.1 in various species of human and animal origin needs to be investigated immediately.
