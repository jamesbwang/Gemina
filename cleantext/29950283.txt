  Previous studies suggest that women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy ( HDP) are at increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease ( CVD). However , it is unclear whether this association differs by timing of onset of HDP. A population-based cohort of 146,748 women , aged 15-45 years , with a first recorded pregnancy were identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. HDP were defined between 18 weeks gestation and 6 weeks postpartum and further sub-classified as early- ( < 34 weeks) and late-onset HDP ( â‰¥ 34 weeks). The primary outcome was incident CVD , and the secondary outcome was incident hypertension. We used marginal structural Cox models to account for time-varying exposure and confounding. Compared with women with no HDP , those with early-onset HDP had a higher risk of developing incident CVD ( HR 2.6 , 95 % CI 1.5 , 4.3) and hypertension ( HR 4.3 , 95 % CI 3.6 , 5.0). Wide CIs precluded any conclusions regarding a difference in the risk of incident CVD and hypertension in women with early- vs late-onset HDP ( HR 0.90 , 95 % CI 0.50 , 1.62 and HR 1.06 , 95 % CI 0.87 , 1.28 , respectively). HDP in at least one pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of subsequent CVD or hypertension , irrespective of time of diagnosis.
