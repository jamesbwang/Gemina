  Malignant bowel obstruction ( MBO) is a major complication in women with advanced gynecologic cancers which imposes a significant burden on patients , caregivers , and healthcare systems. Symptoms of MBO are challenging to palliate and result in progressive decompensation of already vulnerable patients with limited therapeutic options and a short prognosis. However , there is a paucity of guidelines or innovative approaches to improve the care of women who develop MBO. MBO is a complex clinical situation that requires a multidisciplinary approach to ensure the appropriate treatment modality and interprofessional care to optimally manage these patients. This review summarizes the current literature on the different approaches targeting MBO management including surgical intervention , chemotherapy , total parenteral nutrition , and pharmacological treatment. In addition , the impact of MBO management on patients ' quality of life ( QOL) is examined. This article focuses on the challenges in developing evidence-based treatment guidelines for MBO and barriers in clinical trial design for MBO and proposes strategies to advance the MBO management. Collaboration is essential to design studies that may improve the overall care and quality of life for these patients. Prospective data are needed to inform clinical practice , establish a new benchmark for evidence-based MBO management , and better understand the biology of MBO.
