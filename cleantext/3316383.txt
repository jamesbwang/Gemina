  The preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR) , C-reactive protein/albumin ratio ( CRP/Alb ratio) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio ( PLR) have been demonstrated to predict the clinical outcome of various human cancer , including renal cell carcinoma ( RCC). The aim of our study was to explore the prognostic values of these ratios in patients with Xp11 .2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusions renal cell carcinoma ( Xp11 .2 tRCC). A retrospective multicentre study was performed in 82 Xp11 .2 tRCC patients who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy. The optimal cutoff values of the NLR , CRP/Alb ratio and PLR were determined by the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) analysis. The impact of the NLR , CRP/Alb ratio and PLR , as well as other clinicopathological characteristics , on disease-free survival ( DFS) and overall survival ( OS) were evaluated using the univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The optimal cutoff values of the NLR , CRP/Alb ratio and PLR were set at 2.45 , 140 and 0.08 , respectively , according to the ROC analysis. Univariate analyses showed that the NLR , CRP/Alb ratio and PLR all were associated with DFS of Xp11 .2 tRCC patients ( P < 0.001 , P = 0.005 and P = 0.001 , respectively) and OS of Xp11 .2 tRCC patients ( P = 0.016 , P = 0.003 and P = 0.014 , respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that the NLR was independently associated with DFS of Xp11 .2 tRCC patients ( hazard ratio ( HR): 4.25; 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI): 1.19-15.18; P = 0.026) along with age ( P = 0.004) , the pT status ( P < 0.001) and the pN status ( P < 0.019) , and the NLR ( HR: 26.26; 95 % CI: 1.44-480.3; P = 0.028) also was independently associated with OS in patients with Xp11 .2 tRCC , along with age ( P = 0.016) and a tumour thrombus ( P = 0.007). Overall , relatively high NLRs , CRP/Alb ratios and PLRs were associated with a poor prognosis of Xp11 .2 tRCC patients; among of them , only the NLR independently predicted the progression of Xp11 .2 tRCC , and the NLR may help to identify patients with high metastasis or relapse risk.
