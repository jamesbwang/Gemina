  Nasal cytology is an easy , cheap , non-invasive and point-of-care method to assess nasal<symptom> inflammation<symptom> and disease-specific cellular features. By means of nasal cytology , it is possible to distinguish between different inflammatory patterns that are typically associated with specific diseases ( ie , allergic and non-allergic rhinitis). Its use is particularly relevant when other clinical information , such as signs , symptoms , time-course and allergic sensitizations , is not enough to recognize which of the different rhinitis phenotypes is involved; for example , it is only by means of nasal cytology that it is possible to distinguish , among the non-allergic rhinitis , those characterized by eosinophilic ( NARES) , mast cellular ( NARMA) , mixed eosinophilic-mast cellular ( NARESMA) or neutrophilic ( NARNE) inflammation<symptom>. Despite its clinical usefulness , cheapness , non-invasiveness and easiness , nasal cytology is still underused and this is at least partially due to the fact that , as far as now , there is not a consensus or an official recommendation on its methodological issues. We here review the scientific literature about nasal cytology , giving recommendations on how to perform and interpret nasal cytology.
