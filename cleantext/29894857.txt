  Grip strength is frequently measured as a global indicator of motor function. In clinical populations , such as hemiparesis<symptom> post-stroke , grip strength is associated with upper-extremity motor impairment , function , and ability to execute activities of daily living. However , biomechanical configuration of the distal arm and hand may influence the magnitude and stability of maximal voluntary grip force and varies across studies. The influence of distal arm/hand biomechanical configuration on grip force remains unclear. Here we investigated how biomechanical configuration of the distal arm/hand influence the magnitude and trial-to-trial variability of maximal grip force performed in similar positions with variations in external constraint. We studied three groups of 20 individuals: healthy young , healthy older , and individuals post-stroke. We tested maximal voluntary grip force in 4 conditions: 1: self-determined/ `` free ''; 2: standard; 3: fixed arm-rest; 4: gripper fixed to arm-rest , using an instrumented grip dynamometer in both dominant/non-dominant and non-paretic/paretic hands. Regardless of hand or group , maximal voluntary grip force was highest when the distal limb was most constrained ( i.e. , Condition 4) , followed by the least constrained ( i.e. , Condition 1) ( Cohen 's f = 0.52 , P 's < 0.001). Coefficient of variation among three trials was greater in the paretic hand compared with healthy individuals , particularly in more ( Conditions 3 and 4) compared to less ( Conditions 1 and 2) constrained conditions ( Cohen 's f = 0.29 , P 's < 0.05). These findings have important implications for design of rehabilitation interventions and devices. Particularly in individuals post-stroke , external biomechanical constraints increase maximal voluntary grip force variability while fewer biomechanical constraints yield more stable performance.
