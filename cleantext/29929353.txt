  Pneumomediastinum is defined as the presence of air or gas within the mediastinum and it rarely complicates bronchoscopy. We report , to our best knowledge , the first case of pneumomediastinum following a transbronchial cryobiopsy ( TBLC). TBLC is considered a safe procedure as compared with both transbronchial biopsy and surgical lung biopsy. Systematic reviews , metanalysis and a Pubmed research , revealed that in literature no pneumomediastinum has been mentioned after TBLC. We report this case for to make it known to interventional pulmonologists the possibility that a pneumomediastinum can follow a TBLC. In our case the spontaneous resolution in few days did not require any intervention.
