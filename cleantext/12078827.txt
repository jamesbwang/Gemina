  To date , few studies have reported the prognostic value of pre-treatment hemoglobin levels in patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). In the present study , 416 patients with NSCLC were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that patients with normal pre-treatment hemoglobin ( NPHb) levels had a greater chance of surviving for longer period , than did patients with low pre-treatment hemoglobin ( LPHb) levels ( HR , 2.05; 95 % CI , 1.63-2.57; P < 0.001). After adjustment for age , sex , tumor-node-metastasis stage , Karnofsky performance status , lung lobectomy , chemotherapy and radiotherapy , multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that LPHb was an independent predictor for the poor prognosis of patients with NSCLC ( HR , 1.86; 95 % CI , 1.47-2.36; P < 0.001). Estimation of the cumulative survival revealed that the overall survival of NPHb patients was significantly higher than that for LBHb patients ( P < 0.05) , independent of whether the patients had received lung lobectomy or chemotherapy treatments. In conclusion , low pre-treatment hemoglobin levels were demonstrated to be an independent biomarker for poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC.
