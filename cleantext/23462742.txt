  Neuronal communication relies on action potential discharge , with the frequency and the temporal precision of action potentials encoding information. Hippocampal mossy fibers have long been recognized as conditional detonators owing to prominent short-term facilitation of glutamate release displayed during granule cell burst firing. However , the spiking patterns required to trigger action potential firing in CA3 pyramidal neurons remain poorly understood. Here , we show that glutamate release from mossy fiber terminals triggers action potential firing of the target CA3 pyramidal neurons independently of the average granule cell burst frequency , a phenomenon we term action potential counting. We find that action potential counting in mossy fibers gates glutamate release over a broad physiological range of frequencies and action potential numbers. Using rapid Ca
