  An exercise bout or a dehydration<symptom> often causes a reduction in plasma volume , which should be acknowledged when considering the change in biomarkers before and after the plasma changing event. The classic equation from Dill and Costill ( 1974 , J. Appl. Physiol. , 37 , 247-248) for plasma volume shift is usually utilized in such a case. Although this works well with plasma and serum biomarkers , we argue in this note that this traditional approach gives misleading results in the context of whole blood biomarkers , such as lactate , white cells , and thrombocytes. In this study , we demonstrate that to calculate the change in the total amount of circulating whole blood biomarker , one should utilize a formula ( Formula: see text) Here Hb and BM are , respectively , the concentrations for the hemoglobin and for the inspected whole blood biomarker before ( pre) and after ( post) the plasma changing incident.
