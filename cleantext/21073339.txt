  The activation of hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs) is a central event in the progression of liver fibrosis<disease>. Multiple studies proved that DNA methylation might accelerate HSCs activation. However , the specific pathogenesis of liver fibrosis<disease> remains not fully addressed. Our laboratory performed Genome methylation screening to find out the methylated gene in mice with liver fibrosis<disease>. The pilot experiments showed that the promoter of
