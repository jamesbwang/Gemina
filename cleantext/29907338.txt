  Artificial intelligence ( AI) is emerging as a technology with the power to transform established industries , and with applications from automated manufacturing to advertising and facial recognition to fully autonomous transportation. Advances in each of these domains have led some to call AI the `` fourth '' industrial revolution ( 1). In healthcare , AI is emerging as both a productive and disruptive force across many disciplines. This is perhaps most evident in Diagnostic Radiology and Pathology , specialties largely built around the processing and complex interpretation of medical images , where the role of AI is increasingly seen as both a boon and a threat. In Radiation Oncology as well , AI seems poised to reshape the specialty in significant ways , though the impact of AI has been relatively limited at present , and may rightly seem more distant to many , given the predominantly interpersonal and complex interventional nature of the specialty. In this overview , we will explore the current state and anticipated future impact of AI on Radiation Oncology , in detail , focusing on key topics from multiple stakeholder perspectives , as well as the role our specialty may play in helping to shape the future of AI within the larger spectrum of medicine.
