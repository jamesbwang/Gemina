  This study used a rat model to investigate the protective effect of tadalafil and verapamil on testicular function and oxidative stress after torsion/detorsion. Animals were randomly divided into five groups: G1 , Sham group; G2 , testicular torsion followed by detorsion ( TD); G3 , testicular torsion/detorsion received 0/4 mg/kg of tadalafil ( TDT); G4 , testicular torsion/detorsion received 0/1 mg/kg of verapamil ( TDV); and G5 , testicular torsion/detorsion received 0/1 mg/kg of verapamil and 0/4 mg/kg of tadalafil ( TDTV). All treated groups were received the treatment 30 min before detorsion. Also , after reperfusion period ( 24 hr) , the parameters of spermatozoa were assayed , and blood was measured for oxidative stress markers such as superoxide dismutase ( SOD) , glutathione peroxidase ( GPx) , activity of malondialdehyde ( MDA) and blood levels of testosterone. The histological parameters investigated by Johnson 's scores ( JS) , and also the seminiferous tubule diameter ( STD) and the height of the germinal epithelium ( HE) were measured using the linear eyepiece grids on the light microscope. Between Sham and other groups were observed a significant change in histological parameters. Also , the levels of SOD , GPx and testosterone hormone were significantly decreased in TD while these increased in therapeutic groups. In the duration of ischaemia , the MDA level increased. Treatment with tadalafil and verapamil decreased the MDA level in treatment groups and also observed a significant change in sperm parameters between Sham and other groups. Tadalafil and verapamil can be protected the testis tissue damage and replaced the testicular function by suppressing oxidative stress after testicular torsion.
