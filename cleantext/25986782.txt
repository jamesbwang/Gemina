  Tsunamis cause direct damage to property and destroy infrastructure. In addition , power outages can lead to death , especially for patients who rely on medical equipment requiring a power supply. Recently , Nankai Trough Earthquakes have been predicted , and much effort has been put into developing countermeasures in Japan. Kochi City on Shikoku Island is expected to suffer in the event of a large tsunami. The present study identifies individuals living in Kochi who need evacuation assistance and depend on electrical medical devices , simulates evacuation behavior and inundation during a tsunami using a geographic information system ( GIS) , and considers the usefulness of such a GIS. We asked caregivers , including visiting nurses , to introduce us to homecare recipients who rely on a ventilator , an endotracheal suction device , or other medical devices requiring electric power. We received introductions to 52 homecare recipients. Using a GIS , we plotted the area of predicted inundation and the locations of homecare recipients , nursing stations , and welfare evacuation shelters. We predicted evacuation routes , and then analyzed the time difference between the time required for evacuation and tsunami arrival at a welfare evacuation shelter. To measure the effects of the main parameters , we conducted both one-way and multi-way sensitivity analysis. In the event of a tsunami , eight of the homecare recipients living in the forecasted inundation areas in Kochi may face delayed evacuation. Among homecare recipients facing a high possibility of escape delay , 95.2 % lived more than 1,800 m from the nearest welfare evacuation shelter. We found that individual evacuation behavior can be simulated by specifying the residence of a homecare recipient and the evacuation route using a GIS.
