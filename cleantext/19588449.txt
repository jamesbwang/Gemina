  Maximizing response rates in questionnaires can improve their validity and quality by reducing non-response bias. A comprehensive analysis is essential for producing reasonable conclusions in patient-reported outcome research particularly for topics of a sensitive nature. This often makes long ( â‰¥ 7 pages) questionnaires necessary but these have been shown to reduce response rates in mail surveys. Our work adapted the `` Total Design Method , '' initially produced for commercial markets , to raise response rates in a long ( total: 11 pages , 116 questions) , non-incentivized , very personal postal survey sent to almost 350 women. A total of 346 women who had undergone mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction from 2008-2014 ( inclusive) at Addenbrooke 's University Hospital were sent our study pack ( Breast-Q satisfaction questionnaire and support documents) using our modified `` Total Design Method. '' Participants were sent packs and reminders according to our designed schedule. Of the 346 participants , we received 258 responses , an overall response rate of 74.5 % with a useable response rate of 72.3 %. One hundred and six responses were received before the week 1 reminder ( 30.6 %) , 120 before week 3 ( 34.6 %) , 225 before the week 7 reminder ( 64.6 %) and the remainder within 3 weeks of the final pack being sent. The median age of patients that the survey was sent to , and the median age of the respondents , was 54 years. In this study , we have demonstrated the successful implementation of a novel approach to postal surveys. Despite the length of the questionnaire ( nine pages , 116 questions) and limitations of expenses to mail a survey to ~ 350 women , we were able to attain a response rate of 74.6 %.
