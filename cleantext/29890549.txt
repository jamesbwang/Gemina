  Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder in which several converging immune responses modulate and induce lipid accumulation in macrophages. Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule ( ALCAM) has been described as a structural homologue of HDL-receptor and functions as a pattern recognition receptor ( PRR) , while its soluble form sALCAM is involved in ALCAM-dependent and- independent immune mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of aggressive removal of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C) and lipoprotein ( a) ( Lp ( a)) by lipoprotein-apheresis ( LA) on sALCAM and blood viscosity as well as to evaluate its association with lipoproteins and serum markers of
