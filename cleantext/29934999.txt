  A sensitive HPLC-MS/MS method was established for the quantification of ceftriaxone sodium ( CFT) and lidocaine HCl ( LDC) in human plasma utilizing cefixime ( CFX) and tadalafil ( TDA) as internal standards. The analytes were extracted from human plasma by protein precipitation using acetonitrile. Chromatographic separation was performed on Kinetex C
