  The idea of coronary microcirculation playing a role in the pathophysiology of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> dates from decades ago , with authors hypothesizing that structural and functional alterations in the coronary microcirculation could potentially contribute to heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. It is known that in a wide range of primary cardiomyopathies , from dilated to hypertrophic , there are pathological alterations in myocardial vasculature structure and function , playing a role in the clinical course of the disease. Needless to say , many patients with normal epicardial coronary arteries can suffer from coronary microvascular dysfunction , that could lead to a wide variety of clinical problems- from impaired functional capacity to stable and unstable angina , Takotsubo syndrome<symptom> , myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries and can also end up with either acute or chronic<symptom> heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. Furthermore , nowadays , it has been recognized that pathophysiology of the heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF) is mainly due to myocardial microcirculatory impairment. In heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF) neurohumoral mechanisms affecting the peripheral vasculature have been identified as important factors in the development and progression of heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , leading to unfavourable remodelling , and thus some of them being important treatment targets. Among many new clinical scenarios where both myocardial and peripheral microcirculation plays an important role , raising field of implantable continuous flow assist devices opens many questions and implies better understanding of their effects of microcirculation , as they usually lead to improvement of end organ dysfunction caused by previous heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , which is probably through their positive effects of peripheral microcirculation.
