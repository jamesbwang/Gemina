  Iron deficiency ( ID) , with or without anemia<symptom> , is frequent in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients , and iron supplementation improves patient condition. However , the link between ID ( independently of anemia<symptom> and cardiac function is poorly understood , but could be explained by an impaired mitochondrial metabolism. Our aim was to explore this hypothesis in a mouse model. We developed a mouse model of ID without anemia<symptom> , using a blood withdrawal followed by 3-weeks low iron diet. ID was confirmed by low spleen , liver and heart iron contents and the repression of HAMP gene coding for hepcidin. ID was corrected by a single ferric carboxymaltose ( FCM) injection ( ID + FCM mice). Hemoglobin levels were similar in ID , ID + FCM and control mice. ID mice had impaired physical performances and left ventricular function ( echocardiography). Mitochondrial complex I activity of cardiomyocytes was significantly decreased in ID mice , but not complexes II , III and IV activities. ID + FCM mice had improved physical performance , cardiac function and complex I activity compared to ID mice. Using BN-PAGE , we did not observe complex I disassembly , but a reduced quantity of the whole enzyme complex I in ID mice , that was restored in ID + FCM mice. ID , independently of anemia<symptom> , is responsible for a decreased left ventricular function , through a reduction in mitochondrial complex I activity , probably secondary to a decrease in complex I quantity. These abnormalities are reversed after iron treatment , and may explain , at least in part , the benefit of iron supplementation in heart<symptom> failure<symptom> patients with ID.
