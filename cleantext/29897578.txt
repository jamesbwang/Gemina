  Tamarixia radiata ( Waterson) ( Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is an idiobiont ectoparasitoid of the Asian citrus psyllid , Diaphorina citri Kuwayama ( Hemiptera: Psyllidae). This study evaluated natural parasitism of the different nymphal instars of D. citri by T. radiata on three different dates in 2015 at four sites with Mexican lemon ( Citrus aurantifolia Swingle) groves and at one site with orange jasmine ( Murraya paniculata ( L.) Jacq.) plants in the Apatzingán Valley , Michoacán state. Different patterns of parasitism by T. radiata were observed among the different nymphal instars of D. citri , sites , and collection dates. No parasitism of first and second instars was observed , and it only reached up to 5.0 % in third instars. In fourth and fifth instars , parasitism was highly variable ( 2-69 and 1-38 % , respectively). In terms of the accumulated parasitism across host instars , the highest percentages were observed in the collections conducted in May in Crucero de Parácuaro ( 86 %) and Antúnez ( 91 %) , and they were approximately 45 % in the collections conducted on 23 March in Antúnez and on 10 April in Nueva Italia-2. In the remaining collections , parasitism was between 2 and 15 %. Our results suggest that T. radiata is an important mortality factor for populations of D. citri; this could have potentially important implications for the biological control of D. citri and for the management of huanglongbing , a disease transmitted by D. citri , in citrus groves.
