  Along with its outstanding antidepressant effect , electroconvulsive shock<symptom> ( ECS) can induce learning and memory<symptom> impairment<symptom>. Propofol and ketamine have shown to be useful in alleviating the learning and memory<symptom> impairment<symptom>. Nevertheless , the mechanism still remains unclear. This study investigated the role of NMDA receptor ( NMDAR)- mediated metaplasticity in the learning and memory<symptom> impairment<symptom> induced by ECS , as well as the neuroprotective effect of propofol and ketamine in depressive rats. Rats received ECS or ECS under anesthetics after chronic unpredictable mild stress procedure. Long-term potentiation ( LTP) was tested by extracellular recording. LTD/LTP threshold was assessed by stimulation of different frequencies. Additionally , NMDAR-mediated field excitatory postsynaptic potential ( fEPSP) and NMDAR input/output relationship were detected under hippocampal slice perfusion. Results showed that propofol or low-dose ketamine could partially alleviate ECS-induced LTP impairment , while propofol combined with low-dose ketamine almost reversed the LTP impairment. LTP under ECS was increased by stronger stimulation. ECS could up-regulated LTD/LTP threshold , while propofol or ketamine could down-regulate it. Moreover , ECS activated NMDAR , while propofol and ketamine could inhibit the activation of NMDAR. NMDAR input/output relationship decrease was induced by preconditioning ( an analog of ECS in hippocampal slice) , however , NMDAR input/output relationship increased by propofol or ketamine. In conclusion , ECS-induced cognitive impairment is caused by NMDAR-mediated metaplasticity via up-regulation of LTD/LTP threshold. Propofol or ketamine alleviates the cognitive impairment , possibly by down-regulating the threshold via inhibition of NMDAR activation induced by ECS.
