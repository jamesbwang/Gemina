  Extrinsic Fabry ⁻ Perot ( FP) interferometric sensors are being intensively applied for partial discharge ( PD) detection and localization. Previous research work has mainly focused on novel structures and materials to improve the sensitivity and linear response of these sensors. However , the directional response behavior of an FP ultrasonic sensor is also of particular importance in localizing the PD source , which is rarely considered. Here , the directional sensitivity of a microelectromechanical system ( MEMS)- based FP ultrasonic sensor with a 5- & mu; m-thick micromechanical vibrating diaphragm is experimentally investigated. Ultrasonic signals from a discharge source with varying incident angles and linear distances are measured and analyzed. The results show that the sensor has a 5.90 dB amplitude fluctuation over a ± 60 & deg; incident range and an exciting capability to detect weak PD signals from 3 m away due to its high signal ⁻ noise ratio. The findings are expected to optimize the configuration of a sensor array and accurately localize the PD source.
