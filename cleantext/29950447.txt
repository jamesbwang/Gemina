  High growth rate is associated with a short lifespan , but the physiological basis for this trade-off is not well known. Telomere length predicts individual lifespan and in this study we investigated whether embryonic growth rate , manipulated using incubation temperature , affects erythrocyte telomere length in a wild bird species , the common tern (
