  Nanocomposite with a room-temperature ultra-low resistivity far below that of conventional metals like copper is considered as the next generation conductor. However , many technical and scientific problems are encountered in the fabrication of such nanocomposite materials at present. Here , we report the rapid and efficient fabrication and characterization of a novel nitrogen-doped graphene-copper nanocomposite. Silk fibroin was used as a precursor and placed on a copper substrate , followed by the microwave plasma treatment. This resulted nitrogen-doped graphene-copper composite possesses an electrical resistivity of 0.16 µΩ · cm at room temperature , far lower than that of copper. In addition , the composite has superior thermal conductivity ( 538 W/m · K at 25 °C) which is 138 % of copper. The combination of excellent thermal conductivity and ultra-low electrical resistivity opens up potentials in next-generation conductors.
