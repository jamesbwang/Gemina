  This study investigated the potential of aircraft mounted thermal imaging ( AMTI) to locate surficial decomposing remains ( clothed and unclothed) through detection of heat generated by larval aggregations of carrion<disease> feeding insects. Two trials were carried out , each utilising four pig cadavers ( 40-45kg) as human analogues and exposing them to insect activity in autumn and winter on the Swan Coastal Plain , Western Australia. The Western Australia Police Air Wing helicopter , fitted with a forward looking infrared radiometer ( FLIR) camera , was utilised to obtain the AMTI footage of carcasses over time. The helicopter obtained footage on six occasions during Trial 1 and 22 times during Trial 2. The carcasses were visited daily to record temperature data , insect activity and the state of decay. Activity of blow fly larval aggregations and corresponding heat generation was greatest during the active decay stage; in this period surficial remains were strongly detectable by AMTI at distances of up to one kilometre away. The average ambient daytime temperature during autumn was 27.6 ± 3.4 °C and AMTI was most effective 3-8days after death. During winter the average daytime temperature was 14.2 ± 2.6 °C and AMTI was most effective 10-23days after death. As the timing of larval aggregation activity varied significantly in different seasons , climatic conditions must be considered when assessing the window of opportunity for AMTI as a viable search technique. Despite climatic variation , the temperature difference between larval aggregations and surrounding soil was remarkably consistent across both seasons ( 8.9 ± 1.0 °C). AMTI was determined to be most effective between 9 pm and 5 am. A predictive tool for determining the window of opportunity for the successful detection of larval aggregations under Western Australian environmental conditions is provided.
