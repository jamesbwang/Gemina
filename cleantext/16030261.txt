  Inversion of embryonic turning ( inv) cystic mice develop multiple renal cysts<symptom> and are a model for type II nephronophthisis ( NPHP2). The defect of planar cell polarity ( PCP) by oriented cell division was proposed as the underlying cellular phenotype , while abnormal cell proliferation and apoptosis occur in some polycystic kidney disease models. However , how these cystogenic phenotypes are linked and what is most critical for cystogenesis remain largely unknown. In particular , in early cortical cytogenesis in the inv mutant cystic model , it remains uncertain whether the increased proliferation index results from changes in cell cycle length or cell fate determination. To address tubular cell kinetics , doubling time and total number of tubular cells , as well as amount of genomic DNA ( gDNA) , were measured in mutant and normal control kidneys. Despite a significantly higher bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU)- proliferation index in the mutant , total tubular cell number and doubling time were unaffected. Unexpectedly , the mutant had tubular cell loss , characterized by a temporal decrease in tubular cells incorporating 5-ethynyl-2 '- deoxyuridine ( EdU) and significantly increased nuclear debris. Based on current data we established a new multi-population shift model in postnatal renal development , indicating that a few restricted tubular cell populations contribute to cortical tubular formation. As in the inv mutant phenotype , the model simulation revealed a large population of tubular cells with rapid cell cycling and tubular cell loss. The proposed cellular kinetics suggest not only the underlying mechanism of the inv mutant phenotype but also a possible renal homeostatic mechanism for tubule formation.
