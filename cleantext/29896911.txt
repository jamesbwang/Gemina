  Although most recharge estimation studies apply multiple methods to identify the possible range in recharge values , many do not distinguish clearly enough between inherent uncertainty of the methods and other factors affecting the results. We investigated the additional value that can be gained from multi-method recharge studies through insights into hydrogeological understanding , in addition to characterizing uncertainty. Nine separate groundwater recharge estimation methods , with a total of 17 variations , were applied at a shallow aquifer in northwest Ethiopia in the context of the potential for shallow groundwater resource development. These gave a wide range of recharge values from 45 to 814 mm/a. Critical assessment indicated that the results depended on what the recharge represents ( actual , potential , minimum recharge or change in aquifer storage) , and spatial and temporal scales , as well as uncertainties from application of each method. Important insights into the hydrogeological system were gained from this detailed analysis , which also confirmed that the range of values for actual recharge was reduced to around 280-430 mm/a. This study demonstrates that even when assumptions behind methods are violated , as they often are to some degree especially when data are limited , valuable insights into the hydrogeological system can be gained from application of multiple methods.
