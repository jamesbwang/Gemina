  Concerns have been voiced over the capacity of deintensification strategies to preserve neurocognitive function and prevent neurocognitive impairment. We present the 96 week results of a neurocognitive substudy nested within the SALT clinical trial: a randomized , open-label , non-inferiority trial that compares whether atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine is non-inferior to atazanavir/ritonavir + two NRTIs in HIV-suppressed patients on stable triple therapy. A global deficit score ( GDS) for five neurocognitive tasks was used to assess neurocognitive function. Changes in neurocognitive function ( GDS value) were determined at weeks 48 and 96. The effect of atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine , adjusted for significant confounders , on the change in neurocognitive function was determined using analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA) at week 96. The per-protocol analysis included 92 participants ( 47 atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine and 45 atazanavir/ritonavir + two NRTIs). All baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups. At weeks 48 and 96 , changes in GDS ( week 48 , atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine -0.3 ( 95 % CI -0.5 to -0.1) versus atazanavir/ritonavir + two NRTIs -0.2 ( 95 % CI -0.4 to 0.0) , P = 0.39; week 96 , atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine -0.3 ( 95 % CI -0.5 to -0.1) versus atazanavir/ritonavir + two NRTIs -0.2 ( 95 % CI -0.4 to -0.1); P = 0.471) were similar. This absence of differences was also observed in all cognitive tasks. Atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine did not impact the change in neurocognitive function at week 96; the adjusted effect of atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine on GDS change , considering atazanavir/ritonavir + two NRTIs as a reference , was 0.01 ( 95 % CI -0.18 to 0.21) ( P = 0.90). Neurocognitive function remained stable after 96 weeks , both in the atazanavir/ritonavir + lamivudine and in the atazanavir/ritonavir + two NRTIs arms , provided HIV<pathogen> remained suppressed.
