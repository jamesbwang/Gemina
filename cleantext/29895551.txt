  Placenta percreta is increasing in incidence and is associated with the risk of life-threatening haemorrhage. Patients who do not accept blood products present a unique challenge to obstetrician-gynaecologists. In this case report , we present the case of a 42-year-old pregnant Jehovah 's Witness with a complete placenta previa and confirmed percreta at 26 weeks ' gestation. Due to her religious beliefs against the use of blood products , she was managed with a stepwise surgical approach which involved caesarean delivery with internal iliac ( hypogastric) artery ligation , weekly methotrexate and delayed hysterectomy 6 weeks later. Non-traditional , alternative approaches to the management of abnormal placentation in patients declining blood products warrant exploration.
