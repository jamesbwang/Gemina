  To assess left ventricular ( LV) systolic function and morphology in patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM) , using both conventional and a complex technique , speckle-tracking echocardiography , and evaluate the correlation between pre-ejection period and left ventricular ejection period ( PEP/LVET) ratio , global longitudinal strain ( GLS) , and severity of the condition. Seventeen patients were enrolled after rigorous criteria. Echocardiography was performed in conventional and speckle-tracking mode , in all patients with DCM , in sinus rhythm. LV dimensions , volumes and ejection fraction ( LVEF) were measured. PEP/LVET ratio was obtained from apical 5-chamber axis and was defined as the time between QRS onset and LV ejection reported to LV ejection period. Speckle-tracking imaging was performed in offline mode and GLS was obtained from parasternal 4- , 3- , 2-chamber apical view , by averaging longitudinal peak systolic strain of all 17 LV-segments. New<pathogen> York Heart Association ( NYHA) functional class correlated significantly with LVEF ( -0.82; p = 0.0006) , PEP/LVET ( 0.86; p = 0.001) or GLS ( 0.85; p = 0.0002). Considerable correlations were between mitral regurgitation ( MR) severity and LVEF ( -0.65; p = 0.01) or PEP/LVET ( 0.69; p = 0.0059) , but higher were between MR severity and GLS ( 0.76; p = 0.0018). Tricuspid regurgitation ( TR) grading correlated statistically with LVEF ( -0.62; p = 0.01) , PEP/LVET and GLS ( 0.6; p = 0.018; and 0.62; p = 0.014 , respectively). As opposed to the parameters in conventional echocardiography , GLS correlated with DCM etiology ( p = 0.0046) and with the gender ( p = 0.048). This study demonstrates that , in patients with DCM , assessment of cardiac dyssynchrony can be accurately accomplished by combining parameters in conventional and in speckle-tracking echocardiography.
