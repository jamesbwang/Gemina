  To investigate the hypoglycemic characteristics of hospitalized elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM). From January , 2014 to December , 2015 , the data of 58 565 blood measurements using a standard blood glucose monitoring system ( BGMS) were collected from 1187 cases of patients with type 2 diabetes during hospitalization in the Department of Endocrinology , Guangdong General Hospital ( Guangzhou , China). Stratified analyses were conducted by dividing the patients into 3 age groups , namely < 45 years group ( 128 cases) , 45-64 years group ( 594 cases) , and ≥ 65 years group ( 465 cases). The incidence and time distribution of hypoglycemia in these patients were compared among the 3 age groups. The risk of hypoglycemia increased with age. Compared with those below 45 years of age , the patients beyond or equal to 65 years had a significantly increased hypoglycemic density ( 0.95 % vs 0.40 % , P < 0.001) , a higher proportion of patients with hypoglycemia ( 28.17 % vs 10.94 % , P < 0.001) , and greater patient-days with hypoglycemia ( 4.48 % vs 1.76 % , P < 0.001). In the elderly patients , hypoglycemia occurred most frequently before dawn , at which time the hypoglycemic density was 2.66 % in patients ≥ 65 years of age , significantly higher than that in patients below 45 years ( 1.09 % , P < 0.05) and between 45 and 64 years ( 1.90 % , P < 0.05); the proportion of patients with hypoglycemia was also significantly higher in the elderly patients ( 14.57 %) than in those below 45 years ( 3.77 % , P < 0.02) and between 45 and 64 years ( 9.42 % , P < 0.02). The proportion of patients with recurrent hypoglycemia ( ≥ 2 times) was significantly higher in patients ≥ 65 years ( 13.33 %) than in younger patients ( 2.34 % in < 45 years group and 9.43 % in 45-64 years group , P < 0.05). The hypoglycemic risk in hospitalized elderly patients with T2DM is significantly higher than that in younger patients , especially before dawn and in terms of recurrent hypoglycemia. Clinicians should develop differential blood glucose monitoring and management strategies for these elderly patients to improve the clinical safety.
