  Purpose Prepare a list of noun phrases able to characterize the writing performance of schoolchildren according to school year. Methods A list of 25 noun phrases intended for dictation was prepared and applied to 275 Elementary School students ( 2nd to 5thgrades). The unidimensionality underlying the proposed items was analyzed using Item Response Theory. Results The list enabled differentiation between the performance of schoolchildren attending the 2nd and 3rd years and that of students attending the 4 th and 5th years. Items on the list presented moderate difficulty level and medium discrimination capacity. Conclusion The model showed good fit and was able to differentiate the performance of 2nd to 3rd grade students from that of 4th to 5thgrade students. The list of noun phrases assessed writing in 4th to 5th grade students more accurately.
