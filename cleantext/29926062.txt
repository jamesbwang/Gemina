  The specific loss of cholinergic neurons and the progressive deficits of cognitive function are the most primary characteristics of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD). Although the neurotoxicity of amyloid β protein ( Aβ) in AD has been investigated extensively , it is still unclear whether the Aβ aggregated in the medial septum ( MS) , a major cholinergic nucleus projecting to the hippocampus , could affect hippocampal synaptic plasticity and further impair the memory<symptom> behaviors<symptom>. The present study investigated the effects of Aβ injection into the MS on hippocampal long-term potentiation ( LTP) and cognitive behaviors of rats by using Morris water maze ( MWM) , Y maze and in vivo hippocampal LTP recording. The effects of kainic acid ( KA) , an agent with specific neurotoxicity to GABAergic neurons , were also observed. The results showed that: ( 1) Intra-MS injection of Aβ
