  Tobacco smoking kills more than 5 million people annually and it is the most important cause of preventable death. Waterpipe smoking is common in the Middle<pathogen> East and is prevalent among young people. There is a misconception that it is less harmful than cigarette smoking. Physicians are considered role models in the community and their behaviours and attitudes towards smoking can have direct effects on cessation. The aim of this study was to estimate current prevalence , attitudes and associated factors in regard to waterpipe smoking among Saudi Arabian physicians. Using a self-administered questionnaire , we conducted a cross-sectional study among 454 male and female physicians from 3 specialties , and of various levels of training working in 4 hospitals in Riyadh. The prevalence of waterpipe smoking was 45 % , greater in men than in women ( 58 % vs 18 %; P ≤ 0.001) and in surgical than in medical specialists ( 58 % vs 38 %; P ≤ 0.001). More non-smokers than smokers believed that physicians should serve as role models ( 79 % vs 60 %; P ≤ 0.001). Physicians who were waterpipe non-smokers had received more formal training about cessation than smokers ( 50 % vs 36 %; P ≤ 0.001). Waterpipe smoking among Saudi Arabian physicians is frequent and is associated with low exposure to information about the hazards and cessation during medical education.
