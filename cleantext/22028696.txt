  concepts play a central role in human behaviour and constitute a critical component of the human conceptual system. Here , we investigate the neural basis of four types of abstract concepts , examining their similarities and differences through neuroimaging meta-analyses. We examine numerical and emotional concepts , and two higher-order abstract processes , morality judgements and theory of mind. Three main findings emerge. First , representation of abstract concepts is more widespread than is often assumed. Second , representations of different types of abstract concepts differ in important respects. Each of the domains examined here was associated with some unique areas. Third , some areas were commonly activated across domains and included inferior parietal , posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex. We interpret these regions in terms of their role in episodic recall , event representation and social-emotional processing. We suggest that different types of abstract concepts can be represented and grounded through differing contributions from event-based , interoceptive , introspective and sensory-motor representations. The results underscore the richness and diversity of abstract concepts , argue against single-mechanism accounts for representation of all types of abstract concepts and suggest mechanisms for their direct and indirect grounding.This article is part of the theme issue ` Varieties of abstract concepts: development , use and representation in the brain '.
