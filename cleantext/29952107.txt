  Dip-pen nanolithography ( DPN) is used to precisely position core/thick-shell ( `` giant '') quantum dots ( gQDs; ≥ 10 nm in diameter) exclusively on top of silicon nanodisk antennas ( ≈ 500 nm diameter pillars with a height of ≈ 200 nm) , resulting in periodic arrays of hybrid nanostructures and demonstrating a facile integration strategy toward next-generation quantum light sources. A three-step reading-inking-writing approach is employed , where atomic force microscopy ( AFM) images of the pre-patterned substrate topography are used as maps to direct accurate placement of nanocrystals. The DPN `` ink '' comprises gQDs suspended in a non-aqueous carrier solvent , o-dichlorobenzene. Systematic analyses of factors influencing deposition rate for this non-conventional DPN ink are described for flat substrates and used to establish the conditions required to achieve small ( sub-500 nm) feature sizes , namely: dwell time , ink-substrate contact angle and ink volume. Finally , it is shown that the rate of solvent transport controls the feature size in which gQDs are found on the substrate , but also that the number and consistency of nanocrystals deposited depends on the stability of the gQD suspension. Overall , the results lay the groundwork for expanded use of nanocrystal liquid inks and DPN for fabrication of multi-component nanostructures that are challenging to create using traditional lithographic techniques.
