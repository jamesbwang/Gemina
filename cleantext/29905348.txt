  A mesoionic bicycle , easily synthesized from a proteinogenic amino acid , l-leucine , behaves as both thiazolium-olate and diazolium-olate dipoles , as unveiled by its dipolar cycloadditions. This chameleonic reactivity has been thoroughly interpreted by dissecting the mechanistic landscape aided by the distortion-interaction model.
