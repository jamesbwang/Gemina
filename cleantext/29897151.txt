  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD) , which is characterized by excess accumulation of triglyceride in hepatocytes , is the major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide and no approved drug is available. The mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR) complexes has been implicated in promoting lipogenesis and fat accumulation in the liver , and thus , serve as attractive drug targets. The generation of non- or low cytotoxic mTOR inhibitors is required because existing cytotoxic mTOR inhibitors are not useful for NAFLD therapy. New compounds based on the privileged adenosine triphosphate ( ATP) site binder quinoline scaffold conjugated to glucose and galactosamine derivatives , which have significantly low cytotoxicity , but strong mTORC1 inhibitory activity at low micromolar concentrations , have been synthesized. These compounds also effectively inhibit the rate of lipogenesis and lipid accumulation in cultured hepatocytes. This is the first report of glycomimetic-quinoline derivatives that reduce lipid load in hepatocytes.
