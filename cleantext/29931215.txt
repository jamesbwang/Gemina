  The use of electronic cigarettes ( ECs) has been on the rise with increased number of battery explosions causing burns. This study is a retrospective review of patients who presented with burns caused by EC explosions.Here , we present a case series of eight patients sustaining burns from EC explosions , within a year , to elucidate the pattern of such burns and to provide a treatment guideline.All of them were males. Five patients had partial-thickness burns and three had full-thickness burns. TBSA ranged from 4 to 16 % ( burns to lower extremity ( n = 7) , hand ( n = 3) , scrotum/penis ( n = 2) , chest ( n = 1)). None had inhalation injuries. Two patients ( 29 %) required skin grafting.EC explosion is predominantly attributed to its lithium-ion battery. Several types of injuries can occur , including chemical and thermal burns , inhalation injuries , metal poisoning<disease> , etc.. There are currently no specific guidelines on the management of burns due to lithium-ion battery exposure. Herein , we recommend the following: Initial assessment of injuries should accompany the Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines; serum levels of lithium , cobalt , and manganese should be checked and elevated levels should be monitored; patients should be monitored for signs of metal toxicity; wound<disease> should be extensively debrided and irrigated to remove any residual materials; and litmus test should be performed to check for alkali pH prior to irrigation with water or other aqueous solutions.
