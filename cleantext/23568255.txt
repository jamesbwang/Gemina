  There is an association between osteoarthritis-related pain severity and function , yet clear evidence about the sole influence of neuropathic-like symptoms on joint function and health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) is lacking. Previous studies among knee OA patients show an association between neuropathic-like symptoms , lower functional status and lower quality of life , however analyses were unadjusted or had limited adjustment for influential covariates like pain intensity. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the influence of neuropathic-like symptoms-adjusted for multiple influential covariates-on joint-specific function and HRQoL in hip and knee OA patients. In this observational study 255 patients ( 117 with hip OA and 138 with knee OA) completed the modified painDETECT questionnaire ( mPDQ) to identify subjects with neuropathic-like symptoms ( mPDQ score > 12 , possible neuropathic pain ( NP) phenotype). The WOMAC and the RAND-36 were used to asses respectively function and HRQoL. Results were adjusted stepwise for age , sex and BMI ( Model 1); back disorder , painful body regions , comorbidities and previous surgery ( Model 2); and pain intensity and analgesic usage ( Model 3). A possible NP phenotype was experienced by 37 % of hip and 46 % of knee OA patients. Final model 3 analysis revealed that hip OA patients with neuropathic-like symptoms scored significantly lower on pain-related aspects of HRQoL ( ΔRAND-36 bodily pain: 6.8 points , p = 0.047) compared to patients with the unlikely NP phenotype. In knee OA patients , a possible NP phenotype was associated with diminished joint function ( ΔWOMAC domains ranging 7.1 to 10.5 points , p < 0.05) and more deficits on the physical functional aspect of HRQoL ( ΔRAND-36 physical functioning: 6.8 points , p = 0.016). Neuropathic-like symptoms deteriorate the subjective rating of pain-related quality of life in hip OA patients and significantly influence function in knee OA patients.
