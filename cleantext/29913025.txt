  Proper management of a patient with small to moderate horizontal deviations continues to be challenging for the strabismus surgeon. The use of one-muscle surgery for comitant strabismus has been controversial because of concerns that it may result in a significant number of undercorrections and/or ocular incomitance. Recent literature on unilateral rectus<pathogen> muscle surgery has shown that this surgery is a safe and effective procedure for small and moderate angle horizontal deviations. It has the advantage of limiting surgery to one eye , reducing operative time and possible cost to the family , and leaving other muscles untouched in case repeat surgery is necessary. Larger studies need to be done in the future; however , this surgery should be considered as a primary approach in the treatment of small to moderate angle esotropia.
