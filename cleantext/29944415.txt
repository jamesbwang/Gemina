  Aggressive behaviour represents a challenge in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia , being often associated with clinical predictors of severity of illness such as poor insight , psychotic re-exacerbation , concomitant substance misuse or comorbidity with personality disorders. As psychotic relapses and consequent risk of aggressive behaviour are often associated with a poor compliance , purpose of the present manuscript is to give an overview of the available data about the use of depot antipsychotics for the management of violence in patients with schizophrenia. A research in the main database sources has been conducted to identify relevant papers about the topic. Few studies ( most of them retrospective and with small sample sizes) have investigated the effectiveness of depot antipsychotic for the treatment of aggressive behaviour in schizophrenia. Aripiprazole depot appears to be promising for the management of aggressive behaviour of subjects with schizophrenia , however data about its efficacy in the long-term are absent and lack of evidence prevents the recommendation of this compound for the treatment of aggressiveness in subjects affected by schizophrenia. In addition , there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that a specific depot antipsychotic may have a better efficacy on aggressive behaviour of patients affected by schizophrenia. Prospective comparative studies ( e.g. with oral clozapine and aripiprazole depot) are needed to assess the real clinical advantage of the use of depot antipsychotic versus oral alternatives for the prevention of violent behaviour in schizophrenia.
