  This paper presents a boundary feedback control design for a fractional reaction diffusion ( FRD) system with a space-dependent ( non-constant) diffusion coefficient via the backstepping method. The contribution of this paper is to generalize the results of backstepping-based boundary feedback control for a FRD system with a space-independent ( constant) diffusion coefficient to the case of space-dependent diffusivity. For the boundary stabilization problem of this case , a designed integral transformation treats it as a problem of solving a hyperbolic partial differential equation ( PDE) of transformation 's kernel , then the well posedness of the kernel PDE is solved for the plant with non-constant diffusivity. Furthermore , by the fractional Lyapunov stability ( Mittag-Leffler stability) theory and the backstepping-based boundary feedback controller , the Mittag-Leffler stability of the closed-loop FRD system with non-constant diffusivity is proved. Finally , an extensive numerical example for this closed-loop FRD system with non-constant diffusivity is presented to verify the effectiveness of our proposed controller.
