  Plasma-based technologies take an increasing place in the new conceptions of wastewater management as a promising tool for the treatment of persistent organic pollutants with low biodegradability. Plasma major advantage is the synergy of diverse active components with high oxidative action and additional benefits as disinfection of treated water. But the bactericidal effect of plasma can influence the treatment effectiveness when this technology is used in combination with biological methods for the removal of pollutants. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of non-thermal atmospheric plasma torch on key enzymes from phenol biodegradation pathways in Pseudomonas<pathogen> aureofaciens ( chlororaphis<pathogen>) AP-9. The strain was isolated from contaminated soils and had a high potential for biodegradation of aromatic compounds. The used plasma source is surface-wave-sustained discharge operating at 2.45 GHz in argon produced by an electromagnetic wave launcher surfatron type. The enzyme activities of phenol 2-monooxygenase ( P2MO) , catechol 1,2-dioxygenase ( C12DO) , catechol 2,3-dioxygenase ( C23DO) , protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase ( P34DO) and succinate dehydrogenase ( SDH) were measured in control and after plasma treatment of 10 , 30 and 60 s. At short-time treatment , the activities of intradiol dioxygenases increased with 26 % and 59 % for C12DO and P34DO , respectively. Other oxygenases and SDH were inhibited with 35 % even at 10 s treatment. Longer treatment times had a clear negative effect but SDH kept the higher activity at 60 s treatment compared to the oxygenases. Our data suggest that plasma-based technologies are a useful approach for post-treatment of aryl-containing wastewater in order to increase the effectiveness of biological removal.
