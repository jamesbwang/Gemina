  Sedation with dexmedetomidine and propofol may cause hypotension<symptom> or bradycardia<symptom>. This study aimed to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine and propofol on hemodynamics and clinical outcomes in surgical intensive care unit ( ICU) patients after major abdominal surgery. Enrolled patients were randomly allocated to the dexmedetomidine or propofol group. Cardiac index was measured using a continuous noninvasive cardiac output monitor on the basis of chest bioreactance. Heart rate , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , opioid requirement , urine output , delirium<symptom> incidence , ICU length of stay , and total hospital length of stay were compared between the two groups. The incidences of bradycardia<symptom> , hypotension<symptom> , and severe low cardiac index were compared. We enrolled 60 patients. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group than in the propofol group. Cardiac index did not differ significantly between the two groups ( dexmedetomidine group 3.1 L/min/m Cardiac index did not differ significantly between the dexmedetomidine and propofol groups in surgical ICU patients after major abdominal surgery.
