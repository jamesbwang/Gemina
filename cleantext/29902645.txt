  Levels of antibodies against the hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) core protein ( anti-HBc) have been associated with response to nucleos ( t) ide analogue and ( peg) interferon therapy in patients with chronic HBV<pathogen> infection. We performed a prospective study to determine whether the total serum level of anti-HBc level ( immunoglobulins M and G) is associated with clinical relapse after discontinuation of nucleos ( t) ide analogue-based therapy. We collected data from patients with chronic HBV infection who discontinued nucleos ( t) ide analogue therapy according to pre-specified stopping criteria , recruited from November 2012 through July 2016 at an academic hospital in Guangzhou , China. Patients were followed through February 2017. We performed comprehensive biochemical and virologic tests at every visit , and anti-HBc was quantified for 2 years after treatment cessation ( at baseline and weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 48 , and 96). The primary endpoint was clinical relapse , defined as level of HBV<pathogen> DNA > 2000 IU/mL and level of alanine aminotransferase more than 2-fold the upper limit of normal-these were also the criteria for retreatment. We followed 100 patients ( 71 % positive for HB e antigen ( HBeAg) at the start of nucleos ( t) ide analogue therapy , 43 % treated with entecavir or tenofovir) for a median of 2.5 years after stopping therapy. Clinical relapse occurred in 39 patients ( in 46 % of patients at year 4 after discontinuation). High level of anti-HBc at the end of treatment ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 0.31 per log IU/mL; P = .002) and low level of HB surface antigen ( HBsAg) at the end of treatment ( HR , 1.71 per log IU/mL; P = .032) were associated with a reduced risk of clinical relapse after adjusting for age , start of nucleos ( t) ide analogue therapy HBeAg-status , and consolidation therapy duration. At year 4 , 21 % of patients with anti-HBc levels at the end of treatment ≥ 1000 IU/mL developed a clinical relapse compared to 85 % of patients with levels < 100 IU/mL ( P < .001). An HBsAg level at the end of treatment ≤ 100 IU/mL was associated with a reduced risk of relapse ( HR 0.30; P = .045). However , 82 % of patients had levels of HBsAg above 100 IU/mL; for these patients , level of anti-HBc at the end of treatment could be used to determine the risk of relapse ( HR 0.39 per log IU/mL; P = .005). In a median 2.5-year follow-up study of patients with chronic HBV<pathogen> infection who stopped nucleos ( t) ide analogue therapy , total serum level of anti-HBc at the end of treatment was associated with risk of clinical relapse. Serum level of anti-HBc might be used to select patients suitable for discontinuing nucleos ( t) ide analogue therapy.
