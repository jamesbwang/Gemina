  Gastric cancer ( GC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. This study aims to investigate the differential tissue expression of ppGalNAc-T15 and to evaluate its possible association with clinical-pathological parameters and outcome of gastric adenocarcinoma patients. For these 70 patients were evaluated the expression by immunohistochemistry to ppGalNAc-T15. Our results showed that 33 ( 47.1 %) patients were ppGalNAC-T15 + positive and 37 ( 52.9 %) negative. Positive staining for ppGalNAc-T15 was significantly present in patients older than 60 years ( P = 0.0306) and submitted to total gastrectomy ( P = 0.0087). Also , some results remained at the limit of significance as surgical standing ( P = 0.0562) and histological grade ( P = 0.0549). Therefore , the ppGalNAc-T15 immunoreactivity can be useful to understand the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer.
