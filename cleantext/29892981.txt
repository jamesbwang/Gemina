  This study was conducted using 120 multiparous Awassi ewes during the breeding season to compare the effects of using previously used controlled internal drug release ( CIDR) on the hormone profiles , reproductive performance and economic measures of ewes. Ewes were randomized to receive one of five previously used CIDR ( previously used for 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 or 30 days) or the new CIDR as a control for 6 days ( CIDR6 , CIDR12 , CIDR18 , CIDR24 , CIDR30 , and CIDR0 ( control) , respectively). Blood samples were collected on four occasions , at the time of CIDR insertion , after 3 days of insertion , and at the time of withdrawal and insemination. Serum estradiol ( E2) and progesterone ( P4) concentrations were measured. Timed insemination was performed 48 hr post-CIDR withdrawal. Pregnancy was diagnosed by ultrasonography 23 days after insemination and confirmed on day 35. The heat detection rate was significantly ( p < 0.05) higher in the CIDR0 and CIDR6 groups than in the CIDR18 and CIDR30 groups. The total pregnancy rate and fecundity were significantly ( p < 0.05) higher in the CIDR6 group than in other groups. P4 level was significantly ( p < 0.05) higher in the CIDR0 group than in the CIDR30 group at the time of removal. At each time point , the E2 level was significantly ( p < 0.05) higher in the CIDR6 group than at the other groups. The total variable cost , total cost , return and net profit were higher in the CIDR6 and CIDR0 groups than in the other groups. In conclusion , although previously used CIDRs are efficient at synchronizing oestrus in ewes , the duration of previously usage significantly affected the reproductive parameters and economic profit. CIDRs previously used for 6 days and new CIDRs provided the highest fertility and fecundity rates , besides return and net profit. Economically , it is not advisable to use CIDRs that previously used for 12 days or more.
