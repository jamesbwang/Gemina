  In this Brief Communication , the authors omitted references to several previous studies that have demonstrated that the TCA variant shown has also been found in several other bacterial species , specifically among some anaerobic Deltaproteobacteria. The Brief Communication focused on showing that this variant is more widespread than previously known , particularly in animal-associated bacteria. Using genetic approaches , Kwong et al. demonstrated this alternative cycle in additional , distantly related organisms. Thus , the previous work does not affect the results of the advance provided. However , the previous studies are relevant to this topic and should have been cited , and Kwong et al. apologize for this for the omission. Citations to several of the studies should have been included as refs 9-13 in the text as shown.
