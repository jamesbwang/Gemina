  Activity of Daily Living ( ADL) stages and Instrumental Activity of Daily Living ( IADL) stages demonstrated ordered associations with mortality , risk of hospitalization , and receipt of recommended care. This paper explores the associations of stages with three dimensions of patient activation: self-care efficacy , patient-doctor communication and health-information seeking. We hypothesized that higher ADL and IADL stages ( greater limitation) are associated with a lower level of patient activation. Patient activation factors were derived from the 2004 and 2009 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. In this cross-sectional study ( N = 8981) , the associations of activity limitation stages with patient activation factors were assessed in latent factor models. Greater activity limitation was in general inversely associated with self-efficacy , patient-doctor communication and health information-seeking , even after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. For instance , the mean of self-care efficacy across ADL stages I-IV ( mild , moderate , severe and complete limitation) compared to stage 0 ( no limitation) decreased significantly by 0.17 , 0.29 , 0.34 , and 0.60 , respectively. Covariates associated with suboptimal patient activation were also identified. Our study identified multiple opportunities to improve patient activation , including providing support for older adults with physical impairments , at socioeconomic disadvantages , or with psychological or cognitive impairment.
