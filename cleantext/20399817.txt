  The most ubiquitous gap junction protein within the body , connexin 43 ( Cx43) , is a target of interest for modulating the dermal wound<disease> healing response. Observational studies found associations between Cx43 at the wound<disease> edge and poor healing response , and subsequent studies utilizing local knockdown of Cx43 found improvements in wound<disease> closure rate and final scar appearance. Further preclinical work conducted using Cx43-based peptide therapeutics , including alpha connexin carboxyl terminus 1 ( αCT1) , a peptide mimetic of the Cx43 carboxyl terminus , reported similar improvements in wound<disease> healing and scar formation. Clinical trials and further study into the mode of action have since been conducted on αCT1 , and Phase III testing for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers<disease> is currently underway. Therapeutics targeting connexin activity show promise in beneficially modulating the human body 's natural healing response for improved patient outcomes across a variety of injuries.
