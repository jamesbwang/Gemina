  Scientific terminology presents an obstacle to effective communication with nonscientific audiences. To overcome this obstacle , biology majors in a general microbiology elective completed a project involving two different audiences: a scientific audience of their peers and a general , nonscientific audience. First , students presented an overview of a primary research paper and the significance of its findings to a general , nonscientific audience in an elevator-type talk. This was followed by a peer interview with a student in a journalism course , in which the biology students needed to comprehend the article to effectively communicate it to the journalism students , and the journalism students needed to ask questions about an unfamiliar , technical topic. Next , the biology students wrote a summary of their article for a scientific audience. Finally , the students presented a figure from the article to their peers in a scientific , Bio-Minute format. The biology-journalism partnership allowed biology students to develop their ability to communicate scientific information and journalism students their ability to ask appropriate questions and establish a base of knowledge from which to write.
