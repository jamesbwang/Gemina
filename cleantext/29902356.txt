  Patients with haemophilia may have lower levels of bone mineral density ( BMD) compared with the general population. Moreover , haemophilic patients have increased risk factors for low bone mineral density ( LBMD) such as arthropathy and resulting immobility , increasing their risk for osteoporosis and fractures. To assess the prevalence of LBMD and associated risk factors among a group of Colombian haemophilic patients. In this case-control study , 90 patients with haemophilia A and B , over the age of five , were recruited. Controls were healthy participants matched by age , gender , body mass index ( BMI) , socioeconomic status , and race. All participants underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA) and the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Blood tests were collected to evaluate LBMD determinants in cases. BMD was lower in cases than in the control group. BMD of femoral necks<symptom> was 0.907 g/cm Results from the present study showed that haemophilia was associated with a higher frequency of LBMD. Severity of haemophilia , haemophilic arthropathy , and elevated C-reactive protein levels was directly associated with LBMD.
