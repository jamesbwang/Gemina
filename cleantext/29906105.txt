  State-averaged complete active space self-consistent field ( CASSCF) calculations and a subsequent spin-orbit calculation mixing the CASSCF wave functions ( CASSCF/state-interaction with spin-orbit coupling) is the conventional approach used for ab initio calculations of crystal-field splittings and magnetic properties of lanthanide complexes. However , this approach neglects dynamical correlation. Complete active space second-order perturbation theory ( CASPT2) can be used to account for dynamical correlation but suffers from the well-known problems of multireference perturbation theory , e.g. , intruder state problems. Variational multireference configuration interaction ( MRCI) calculations do not show these problems but are usually not feasible due to the large size of real lanthanide complexes. Here , we present a quasi-local projected internally contracted MRCI approach which makes MRCI calculations of lanthanide complexes feasible and allows assessing the influence of dynamical correlation beyond second-order perturbation theory. We apply the method to two well-studied molecules , namely , ( Er ( N ( SiMe
