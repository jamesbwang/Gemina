  Chemoradiotherapy ( CRT) is the standard of care for locally advanced cervical cancer ( LACC). Pre-treatment lymph nodes ( LN) assessment may have an important therapeutic role. CRT followed by adjuvant chemotherapy increased progression free survival ( PFS) and overall survival ( OS). Our study evaluated the feasibility and the effectiveness of a trimodality strategy in patients with LACC and positive LN. Consecutive patients with LACC treated at the National Cancer Institute of Milan were enrolled. All patients underwent pelvic and para-aortic extraperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy to assess the nodal status. After surgery , patients received radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy according to the stage of disease. Between April 2012 and October 2013 , 19 cervical cancer patients were enrolled. Overall , 10 ( 52.6 %) patients presented with positive LN: 6 in the pelvic area and 4 both in the pelvic and para-aortic area. No perioperative major complications occurred. The most common surgical-related adverse events were bleeding ( 26 %) , respiratory distress ( 5 %) , infection ( 5 %) and the development of lymphoceles ( 25 %). Overall , 15 ( 78.9 %) complete responses and 2 ( 10.5 %) partial responses were registered. After a median follow-up of 43.3 months , 89.5 % of patients were alive at the last visit , and 3-year PFS was 63 %. Trimodality treatment appears feasible , well tolerated and promising in terms of oncologic outcome.
