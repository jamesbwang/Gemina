  With growing use of drug-coated balloons ( DCB) for femoropopliteal ( FP) artery interventions , there is limited information on rates of real-world adjunctive stent use and its association with short and long-term outcomes. We report on 225 DCB treated FP lesions<symptom> in 224 patients from the Excellence in Peripheral Artery Disease ( XLPAD) registry ( NCT01904851) between 2014 and 2016. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel and Wilcoxon rank sum statistics were used to compare stented ( planned or ` bail-out ') versus non-stented DCB treated lesions<symptom>. Stents were implanted in 31 % of FP DCB interventions. Among the 70 stents implanted , 46 % were for ` bail-out ' indications and 54 % were planned. Lesions<symptom> treated with stents were longer ( mean 150 mm vs 100 mm; p < 0.001) and less likely to be in-stent restenosis lesions<symptom> ( 10 % vs 28 %; p = 0.003). Stenting was significantly more frequent in complex FP lesions<symptom> , including chronic total occlusions ( 66 % vs 34 %; p < 0.001). For bail-out stenting , interwoven nitinol stents were the most common type ( 50 %) followed by drug-eluting stents ( 34 %) and bare-metal stents ( 22 %). There were no differences in peri-procedural complication rates or 12-month target limb revascularization rates ( 18.6 % vs 11.6 %; p = 0.162) or 12-month amputation rates ( 11.4 % vs 11 %; p = 0.92) between lesions<symptom> where adjunctive stenting was used versus lesions<symptom> without adjunctive stenting , respectively. In conclusion , in a contemporary ` real-world ' adjudicated multicenter US registry , adjunctive stenting was necessary in nearly a third of the lesions<symptom> , primarily for the treatment of more complex FP lesions<symptom> , with similar short and intermediate-term clinical outcomes compared with non-stented lesions<symptom>.
