  Dysregulation of miRNA profile has been associated with a broad spectrum of cellular processes underlying progression of various human malignancies. Increasing evidence suggests that specific microRNA clusters might be of clinical utility , especially in triple-negative breast carcinoma ( TNBC) , devoid of both predictive markers and potential therapeutic targets. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the existing data on microRNAs in TNBC , their molecular targets , a putative role in invasive progression with a particular emphasis on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) and acquisition of stem-cell properties ( CSC) , regarded both as prerequisites for metastasis , and significance for therapy. PubMed and Medline databases were systematically searched for the relevant literature. 121 articles have been selected and thoroughly analysed. Several miRNAs associated with EMT/CSC and invasion were identified as significantly ( 1) upregulated: miR-10b , miR-21 , miR-29 , miR-9 , miR-221/ 222 , miR-373 or ( 2) downregulated: miR-145 , miR-199a-5p , miR-200 family , miR-203 , miR-205 in TNBC. Dysregulation of miR-10b , miR-21 , miR-29 , miR-145 , miR-200 family , miR-203 , miR-221/ 222 was reported of prognostic value in TNBC patients. Available data suggest that specific microRNA clusters might play an important role in biology of TNBC , understanding of which should assist disease prognostication and therapy.
