  Filoviruses are highly filamentous enveloped animal viruses that can cause severe haemorrhagic fevers<symptom>. The filovirus ribonucleoprotein forms a highly organized double-layered helical nucleocapsid ( NC) containing five different virally encoded proteins. The inner layer consists of NP , the RNA binding protein , complexed with the monopartite linear genome. A distinctive outer layer links individual NP subunits with bridges composed of VP24-VP35 heterodimers , which achieves condensation of the NP-RNA into tight helical coils. There are no vertical connections between the outer helical layers , explaining the flexibility of the NC and its ability to bend into tight curves without breaking the genomic RNA. These properties allow the formation of enveloped virions with varying polymorphisms , including single , linear , continuous , linked , comma-shaped and torroidal forms. Virion length is modular so that just one , or two or more genome copies may be present in each virion , producing polyploid particles. The matrix protein VP40 , which drives budding and envelopment , is found in a layer adjacent to the inner cytoplasmic side of viral envelope and is arranged in a 5 nm lattice structure , but its exact symmetry is unclear. There is a constant low density gap between VP40 and the nucleocapsid , so that the latter is held rigidly centred on the long axis of the viral filament. This gap likely contains a region of flexible contacts between VP40 and the NC. The unique morphology of filoviruses may be related to high titre replication , their ease of transmission , and abilities to invade a wide range of host cells and tissues.
