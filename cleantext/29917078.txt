  To investigate the changes in oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQoL) before , during , and after orthodontic treatment , determine the relationship with the original treatment need and evaluate the influence of self-esteem ( SE). OHRQoL questionnaires were used in an ongoing observational prospective cohort study at baseline ( T0) , 1 year after start ( T1) , and 1 month after the end of active orthodontic treatment ( T2). Participants were 11-16-year-old at baseline and 215 complete cases were obtained from a total of 498. OHRQoL was scored by using the Child Perception Questionnaire ( CPQ11-14) , SE was assessed by the Dutch adaptation of the Harter 's Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents and treatment need was defined by the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need ( IOTN). The Oral Aesthetic Subjective Impact Scale ( OASIS) was included to score perceived treatment need. Data were analyzed with Spearman correlation , Mann-Whitney U-test and linear models for longitudinal data. A significant decrease in IOTN and in OASIS was noted from T0-T1-T2 ( P < 0.0001). CPQ results show a decrease from T0 to T2 , from T1 to T2 and an increase from T0 to T1 ( P < 0.0001). This was valid for the overall CPQ scores and its subdomains except for emotional well-being ( EW) , which decreases from T0-T1-T2. A correlation was found between baseline SE and the change of total CPQ scores between T0 and T2 , also for EW ( r = 0.325 and r = 0.354). OHRQoL ameliorates after orthodontic treatment. High baseline SE works as a protective factor for OHRQoL.
