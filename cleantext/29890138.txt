  Lipids are an energy source and key components of the cell membrane; however , they are also bioactive mediators of physiological and pathophysiological phenomena. Quantification of bioactive lipids is not easy because they have diverse chemical properties and are present in trace amounts. Here , we improved a multiplex method of quantifying bioactive lipids , thereby enabling measurement of 90 compounds simultaneously. We then used this system to quantify bioactive lipids produced by two subsets of dendritic cells ( DCs): all-trans retinoic acid-treated DCs ( RA-DCs) ( a type of tolerogenic DC ( tDC)) and conventional DCs ( cDCs). We found that cDCs produced inflammatory lipid mediators such as leukotrienes , whereas RA-DCs produced anti-inflammatory lipid mediators such as prostaglandin I
