  Microglia are brain phagocytes that participate in brain homeostasis and continuously survey their environment for dysfunction , injury , and disease. As the first responders , microglia have important functions to mitigate neuron and glia dysfunction , and in this process , they undergo a broad range of morphologic changes. Microglia morphologies can be categorized descriptively or , alternatively , can be quantified as a continuous variable for parameters such as cell ramification , complexity , and shape. While methods for quantifying microglia are applied to single cells , few techniques apply to multiple microglia in an entire photomicrograph. The purpose of this method is to quantify multiple and single cells using readily available ImageJ protocols. This protocol is a summary of the steps and ImageJ plugins recommended to convert fluorescence and bright-field photomicrographs into representative binary and skeletonized images and to analyze them using software plugins AnalyzeSkeleton ( 2D/3D) and FracLac for morphology data collection. The outputs of these plugins summarize cell morphology in terms of process endpoints , junctions , and length as well as complexity , cell shape , and size descriptors. The skeleton analysis protocol described herein is well suited for a regional analysis of multiple microglia within an entire photomicrograph or region of interest ( ROI) whereas FracLac provides a complementary individual cell analysis. Combined , the protocol provides an objective , sensitive , and comprehensive assessment tool that can be used to stratify between diverse microglia morphologies present in the healthy and injured brain.
