  Previous studies have shown greater fluorophore uptake during electroporation on the anode-facing side of the cell than on the cathode-facing side. Based on these observations , we hypothesized that hyperpolarizing a cell before electroporation would decrease the requisite pulsed electric field intensity for electroporation outcomes , thereby yielding a higher probability of reversible electroporation at lower electric field strengths and a higher probability of irreversible electroporation ( IRE) at higher electric field strengths. In this study , we tested this hypothesis by hyperpolarizing HL-60 cells using ionomycin before electroporation. These cells were then electroporated in a solution containing propidium iodide , a membrane integrity indicator. After 20 min , we added trypan blue to identify IRE cells. Our results showed that hyperpolarizing cells before electroporation alters the pulsed electric field intensity thresholds for reversible electroporation and IRE , allowing for greater control and selectivity of electroporation outcomes.
