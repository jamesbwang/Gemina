  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world. Recently , targeted therapy and anti-programmed cell death receptor 1 ( PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) immunotherapy have made great progress in treatment of lung cancer. However , responses to these therapies are variable , influenced by genetic alterations , high microsatellite instability and mismatch repair deficiency. Liquid biopsy of extracellular vesicles and circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA) emerges as a new promising non-invasive means that enables not only biomarker determination , but also continuous monitoring of cancer treatment. Notably , tumor extracellular vesicles play important roles in tumor formation and progression , and also serve as natural carriers for anti-tumor drugs and short-interfering RNA. In this review , we summarize the latest progress in understanding the relationships of extracellular vesicles and ctDNA in cancer biology , diagnosis and drug delivery. In particular , the application of extracellular vesicles and ctDNA in anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 immunotherapy is discussed.
