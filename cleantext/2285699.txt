  The purposes of this study were to present a prototype of a bracket-positioning gauge , which makes vertical inclination of the instrument difficult , allowing a reduction of vertical bracket positioning error , and to test its accuracy in bracket positioning by groups of individuals with different clinical experience and in specific groups of teeth. For the testing of the prototype , four groups of six participants each were used: Group 1 was composed of undergraduate students in the dental school , who had no previous experience in bonding orthodontic attachments; Group 2 was composed of orthodontic graduate students in the dental school; Group 3 consisted of orthodontists with a maximum of 5 years of clinical experience; Group 4 comprised orthodontists with more than 5 years of clinical experience. A typodont was simulated with a Class I crowded malocclusion , which reproduced the same occlusal characteristics for all groups to be bonded. All participants were instructed to bond 0.022 Ã— 0.028-in Edgewise brackets on the labial surfaces of the upper and lower incisors , canines , and premolars at a height of 4 mm from the incisal edge or the labial cusp tip. Only the mean value of Group 1 showed statistically significant difference in the comparison with the standard measurement. In the groups of teeth , the difference was significant for the premolar and incisor groups. Clinical experience interfered with the accuracy of vertical positioning of orthodontic attachments. As for the groups of teeth , premolars , followed by canines and incisors had the closest mean values to the standard measurement.
