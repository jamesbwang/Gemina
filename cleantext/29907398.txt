  To test whether an image-processing algorithm can aid in visualization of mesial temporal sclerosis on magnetic resonance imaging by selectively increasing contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR) between abnormal hippocampus and normal brain. In this Institutional Review Board-approved and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study , baseline coronal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images of 18 adults ( 10 females , eight males; mean age 41.2 years) with proven mesial temporal sclerosis were processed using a custom algorithm to produce corresponding enhanced images. Average ( Hmean) and maximum ( Hmax) CNR for abnormal hippocampus were calculated relative to normal ipsilateral white matter. CNR values for normal gray matter ( GM) were similarly calculated using ipsilateral cingulate gyrus as the internal control. To evaluate effect of image processing on visual conspicuity of hippocampal signal alteration , a neuroradiologist masked to the side of hippocampal abnormality rated signal intensity ( SI) of hippocampi on baseline and enhanced images using a five-point scale ( definitely abnormal to definitely normal). Differences in Hmean , Hmax , GM , and SI ratings for abnormal hippocampi on baseline and enhanced images were assessed for statistical significance. Both Hmean and Hmax were significantly higher in enhanced images as compared to baseline images ( p < 0.0001 for both). There was no significant difference in the GM between baseline and enhanced images ( p = 0.9375). SI ratings showed a more confident identification of abnormality on enhanced images ( p = 0.0001). Image-processing resulted in increased CNR of abnormal hippocampus without affecting the CNR of normal gray matter. This selective increase in conspicuity of abnormal hippocampus was associated with more confident identification of hippocampal signal alteration.
