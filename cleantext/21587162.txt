  Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs) are considered as primary candidates for cell-based therapies due to their multiple effects in regenerative medicine. Pre-conditioning of MSCs under physiological conditions-- such as hypoxia , three-dimensional environments , and dynamic cultivation-- prior to transplantation proved to optimize their therapeutic efficiency. When cultivated as three-dimensional aggregates or spheroids , MSCs display increased angiogenic , anti-inflammatory , and immunomodulatory effects as well as improved stemness and survival rates after transplantation , and cultivation under dynamic conditions can increase their viability , proliferation , and paracrine effects , alike. Only few studies reported to date , however , have utilized dynamic conditions for three-dimensional aggregate cultivation of MSCs. Still , the integration of dynamic bioreactor systems , such as spinner flasks or stirred tank reactors might pave the way for a robust , scalable bulk expansion of MSC aggregates or MSC-derived extracellular vesicles. This review summarizes recent insights into the therapeutic potential of MSC aggregate cultivation and focuses on dynamic generation and cultivation techniques of MSC aggregates.
