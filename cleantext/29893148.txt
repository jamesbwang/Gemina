  Mycobacterioses represent a global health problem and rapid diagnostic improvements are urgently required. Mycobacteria-specific fluorescence and bioluminescence phenomena have been found to be useful for a wide range of mycobacteria-focused research. Here , we present a critical survey of the most promising techniques in this field and the potential of new methods under investigation. These approaches include acid-fast staining , intrinsic fluorescence of the coenzyme F
