  Given that literature data may give inconsistent results on the effect of a drug on lipid membrane properties , this work aims to investigate the impact of the liposome composition and experimental protocol design on glucocorticoids ( GRs: cortisol , cortisone , fludrocortisone acetate , methylprednisolone , prednisolone and prednisone)- modulating membrane fluidity and permeability. GRs-loaded liposomes consisting of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ( DPPC) and cholesterol ( CHOL) were prepared by reverse phase evaporation technique ( REV) at DPPC: CHOL: GR molar ratios of 100:100:2.5 , and 100:100:10. The formulations were characterized for their size and homogeneity , encapsulation efficiency and loading rates of GRs , incorporation rates and loading rates of DPPC and CHOL. Changes in DPPC membrane fluidity ( CHOL % 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 and 100) after exposure to methylprednisolone were monitored by using 5- and 16-doxyl stearic acids ( DSA) as spin probes. For permeability studies , the above-mentioned GRs-loaded liposomes and the preformed liposomes exposed to GRs ( 2.5 mol %) were compared for the leakage of an encapsulated fluorescent dye , sulforhodamine B ( SRB) , at 37 °C in buffer ( pH 7.5) containing NaCl. The SRB release kinetics were analyzed by the Higuchi model for two release phases ( from 0 to 10 h , and from 10 to 48 h). All formulations exhibited a monodispersed size distribution of liposomes with a mean particle value close to 0.4 μm , also the DPPC and CHOL were highly incorporated ( > 95 %). High loading rate values of DPPC and CHOL were also obtained. Except for fludrocortisone acetate ( 51 %) and prednisolone ( 77 %) , high loading rate values of GRs were obtained ( > 81 %). Fluidity and permeability studies showed that the GR concentration , CHOL content , experimental protocol design including the period of incubation represent critical parameters to be considered in analyzing the effect of drugs on the membrane properties.
