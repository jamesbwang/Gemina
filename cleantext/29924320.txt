  Impairments in visual function have been well characterized in vitamin A deficiency. However , eye function may also be sensitive to other nutrient deficiencies. We examined associations between visual function-characterized by pupillary threshold or pupillary responsiveness-and nutritional status in Zambian children. We used digital pupillometry to measure visual responses to calibrated light stimuli ( -2.9 to 0.1 log cd/m2) among dark-adapted children aged 4-8 y ( n = 542). We defined pupillary threshold as the first light stimulus at which pupil diameter decreased by ≥ 10 % and considered a pupillary threshold ≥ -0.9 log cd/m2 as impaired. Pupillary responsiveness was defined by absolute percentage of change in pupil diameter from pre- to poststimulus. We tested associations between these measures and serum concentrations of retinol , β-carotene , ferritin , soluble transferrin receptor , and hemoglobin ( Hb < 11.0 or 11.5 g/dL were used to define anemia<symptom> , depending on age) , as well as anthropometric indexes , with the use multilevel mixed-effects models. Pupillary threshold was correlated only with serum retinol ( r = 0.12 , P < 0.05). The strongest correlates of pupillary responsiveness were Hb ( r = -0.16 , P < 0.01) , height-for-age z score ( r = 0.14 , P < 0.05) , weight-for-age z score ( r = 0.14 , P < 0.05) , and soluble transferrin receptor ( r = 0.12 , P < 0.05). In multivariate models , anemia<symptom> was positively associated with pupillary responsiveness ( β = 2.99; 95 % CI: 1.26 , 4.72). In this marginally nourished population , we found positive correlations between vitamin A status , iron status , or anthropometric indexes and visual function. Hb was negatively associated with visual function , with greater pupillary responsiveness among anemic children. We posit that this may signal altered parasympathetic activity , possibly driven by infection. Future studies should consider a broader range of indicators to better characterize the relation between nutrition and visual function. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01695148.
