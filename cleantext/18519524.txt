  Recent research shows that nicotine dependence conveys additional health risks above and beyond smoking behavior. The current study examines whether smoking within 5 min of waking , an indicator of nicotine dependence , is independently associated with asthma outcomes. Data were drawn from five pooled cross-sectional waves ( 2005-14) of NHANES , and the final sample consisted of N = 4081 current adult smokers. Weighted logistic regressions were run examining the relationship between smoking within 5 min of waking and outcomes of lifetime asthma , past-year asthma , and having had an asthma attack in the past year. Control variables included demographics , smoking behavior , family history of asthma , depression<symptom> , obesity , and secondhand smoking exposure. After adjusting for smoking behavior , smoking within 5 min was associated with an approximately 50 % increase in the odds of lifetime asthma ( OR = 1.46 , p = .008) and past-year asthma ( OR = 1.47 , p = .024) , respectively. After additionally adjusting for demographics and other asthma risk factors , smoking within 5 min of waking was associated with a four-fold increase in the odds of lifetime asthma ( OR = 4.05 , p = .015). Smoking within 5 min of waking , an indicator of nicotine dependence , is associated with a significantly increased risk of lifetime asthma in smokers. These findings could be utilized in refining risk assessment of asthma among smokers.
