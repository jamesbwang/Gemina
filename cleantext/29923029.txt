  The Cypass Microstent ( Transcend Medical , Menlo Park , CA , USA) is a biocompatible polyamide implant that is implanted in the suprachoroidal space and improves the flow of the aqueous humour via the uveoscleral pathway. In a retrospective clinical study 162 patients ( 220 eyes) with an average age of 71.8 ( ± 14.2) years with a mild to moderate glaucoma were treated with a Cypass implant. In the study three groups of patients ( group 1 , group 2 and group 3) were formed. Group 1 included patients with pseudophakia who received a Cypass implant , group 2 consisted of patients with a Cypass implant combined with phacoemulsification and implantation of an intraocular lens ( Phako/HKL) and group 3 included patients who had had multiple eye surgeries before the Cypass implantation. The follow-up period of the study was 1 year. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure ( IOP) in group 1 was 20.0 ( ± 8.4) mm Hg and in group 2 was 20.8 ( ± 8.7) mm Hg. The mean IOP fell to 17.7 ( ± 7.1) mm Hg in group 1 ( pressure reduction: 11.7 % , p < 0.05) and in group 2 to 18.0 ( ± 7.0) mm Hg ( pressure reduction: 13.4 % , p > 0.05) 12 months postoperatively. The decrease of IOP in group 3 after 1 year was 11.2 %. In 20.5 % of the cases ( 45 eyes) , additional operative pressure reducing interventions was performed because the target pressure was not achieved. After 1 year patients in group 2 showed a significantly similar reduction in pressure as group 1. Additionally , both groups showed a reduction in the number of locally applied antiglaucoma agents. The reduction of the IOP in group 3 was not significant after 12 months , in contrast to the other two groups.
