  Extracellular ATP is an important short-range signaling molecule that promotes various physiological<symptom> responses<symptom> virtually in all cell types , including pancreatic β-cells. It is well documented that pancreatic β-cells release ATP through exocytosis of insulin granules upon glucose stimulation. We hypothesized that glucose might stimulate ATP release through other non-vesicular mechanisms. Several purinergic receptors are found in β-cells and there is increasing evidence that purinergic signaling regulates β-cell functions and survival. One of the receptors that may be relevant is the P2X7 receptor , but its detailed role in β-cell physiology is unclear. In this study we investigated roles of the P2X7 receptor and pannexin-1 in ATP release , intracellular ATP , Ca
