  Investigation and catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias are currently still based on optimal knowledge of arrhythmia mechanisms in relation to the cardiac anatomy involved , in order to target their crucial components. Currently , most complex arrhythmias are investigated using three-dimensional electroanatomical navigation systems , because these are felt to optimally integrate both the anatomical and electrophysiological features of a given arrhythmia in a given patient. In this article , we review the technical background of available three-dimensional electroanatomical navigation systems , and their potential use in complex ablations.
