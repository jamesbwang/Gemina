  Drops covered by adsorbed particles are a prominent research topic because they hold promise for a variety of practical applications. Unlocking the enormous potential of particle-laden drops in new material fabrication , for instance , requires understanding how surface particles affect the electrical and deformation properties of drops , as well as developing new routes for particle manipulation at the interface of drops. In this study , we utilized electric fields to experimentally investigate the mechanics of particle-covered silicone oil drops suspended in castor oil , as well as particle assembly at drop surfaces. We used particles with electrical conductivities ranging from insulating polystyrene to highly conductive silver. When subjected to electric fields , drops can change shape , rotate , or break apart. In the first part of this work , we demonstrate how the deformation magnitude and shape of drops , as well as their electrical properties , are affected by electric field strength , particle size , conductivity , and coverage. We also discuss the role of electrohydrodynamic flows on drop deformation. In the second part , we present the electric field-directed assembly and organization of particles at drop surfaces. In this regard , we studied various parameters in detail , including electric field strength , particle size , coverage , and electrical conductivity. Finally , we present a novel method for controlling the local particle coverage and packing of particles on drop surfaces by simply tuning the frequency of the applied electric field. This approach is expected to find uses in optical materials and applications.
