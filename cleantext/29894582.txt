  Nail unit melanoma ( NUM) is a rare melanoma variant , usually associated with a poor prognosis because of a delayed diagnosis. Few data are available concerning the management and long-term outcome of in situ NUM. To use a large cohort to provide comprehensive patient data and long-term follow-up information. This will serve to investigate distinctive epidemiological , clinical and histological features of in situ NUM. To report treatment modalities , assess conservative surgery and evaluate its long-term safety. Patients with confirmed diagnosis of in situ NUM were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics , clinical presentation , therapeutic data and follow-up were analysed. Sixty-three cases of in situ NUM were identified as follows: 44 were women ( 70 %) , with a mean age of 51 years. The mean duration of symptoms prior to consultation was 4.3 years ( range 3 months-28 years). Clinically , with 58 cases , i.e. ( 92 %) longitudinal melanonychia was the most common clinical presentation. The thumb was the most affected digit , being afflicted in 28 cases: 44 %. Medical history found a widening and/or recent darkening of the melanonychia in 46 cases ( 82 %). The treatment consisted of , respectively , 56 En bloc excisions of the nail apparatus 89 % of the patients we studied , and seven amputations of the distal phalanx. During the follow-up period ( mean: 10 years) , two patients presented in situ recurrences. The recognition of a NUM at an in situ stage allows early treatment and curing of this tumour. At this early stage , a ` functional surgery ' is a rational approach with an excellent oncologic safety.
