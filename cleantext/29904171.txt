  The increasing anthropologic pressure and the modernization of agriculture have led to a forsaking of pearl millet traditional cultivars , inducing a progressive<symptom> loss<symptom> of the genetic variability encompassed in this locally adapted germplasm. Imperatively , national efforts based on robust data gleaned from genetic surveys have to be undertaken in order to set up suitable conservation priorities. In this study , in addition to the assessment of the genetic diversity and population structure among and within a set of seven pearl millet landrace populations from coastal North Africa , demographic and phylogenetic data , conservation priority scores were calculated according to Vane-Wright et al. ( 1991). To date , genetic diversity of pearl millet in North Africa is still poorly documented. The present survey reports for the first time the use of highly informative nSSR markers ( PIC = 0.74) on Pennisetum glaucum landraces representative of the Mediterranean coastline of North Africa. A high level of genetic diversity was obtained within the investigated landraces ( H
