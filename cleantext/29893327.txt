  Breast cancer mortality rates after metastasis is high. Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( uPAR) and carbonic anhydrase IX ( CAIX) play very important roles during tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate plasma levels of uPAR and CAIX and the effect of anthracycline-based chemotherapy on these biomarkers in patients with operable breast cancer. Sixty-five patients and 25 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Levels of uPAR and CAIX were investigated before and after adjuvant chemotherapy. Basal ( prechemotherapy) uPAR and CAIX levels in patients were compared with those in healthy controls and in patients after 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Levels of uPAR and CAIX were determined using the ELISA method. uPAR and CAIX levels were significantly higher in patients ( P: 0.02 and P: 0.03 , respectively). Postchemotherapy uPAR and CAIX levels were higher than basal levels ( P: 0.645 and P < 0.001 , respectively). A cut-off value of 27.99 pg/mL for uPAR was associated with 45.31 % sensitivity and 84.62 % specificity , and with a positive predictive value ( PPV) of 87.9 % and a negative predictive value ( NPV) of 38.6 %. A cut-off value of 777.84 pg/mL for CAIX was associated with 90.62 % sensitivity and 30.77 % specificity , and with a PPV of 76.3 % and an NPV of 57.1 %. We determined that uPAR and CAIX levels were higher in the fluorouracil , epirubicin , and cyclophosphamide ( FEC) chemotherapy group than in the control group , but there was no difference between the FEC and epirubicin/adriamycin chemotherapy groups in terms of basal and postchemotherapy uPAR , CAIX levels. Furthermore , uPAR is more specific , and CAIX is more sensitive in the diagnosis of breast cancer.
