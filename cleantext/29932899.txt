  A class of long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) has architectural functions in nuclear body construction; however , specific RNA domains dictating their architectural functions remain uninvestigated. Here , we identified the domains of the architectural NEAT1 lncRNA that construct paraspeckles. Systematic deletion of NEAT1 portions using CRISPR/Cas9 in haploid cells revealed modular domains of NEAT1 important for RNA stability , isoform switching , and paraspeckle assembly. The middle domain , containing functionally redundant subdomains , was responsible for paraspeckle assembly. Artificial tethering of the NONO protein to a NEAT1_2 mutant lacking the functional subdomains rescued paraspeckle assembly , and this required the NOPS dimerization domain of NONO. Paraspeckles exhibit phase-separated properties including susceptibility to 1,6-hexanediol treatment. RNA fragments of the NEAT1_2 subdomains preferentially bound NONO/SFPQ , leading to phase-separated aggregates in vitro. Thus , we demonstrate that the enrichment of NONO dimers on the redundant NEAT1_2 subdomains initiates construction of phase-separated paraspeckles , providing mechanistic insights into lncRNA-based nuclear body formation.
