  Belinostat is a second-generation histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDI) predominantly metabolized by UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation. Two common polymorphisms ( UGT1A1 * 28 and UGT1A1 * 60) were previously associated with impaired drug clearance and thrombocytopenia<symptom> risk , likely from increased drug exposure. This latter phenomenon has been observed with other HDIs such as abexinostat , panobinostat , romidepsin , and vorinostat. It was the intention of this brief report to expand a population pharmacokinetic ( PPK) model to include a pharmacodynamic ( PD) model describing the change in platelet levels in patients with cancer administered belinostat as a 48-h continuous intravenous infusion , along with cisplatin and etoposide. The PPK/PD model developed here introduced an additional rate constant to a commonly used mechanistic myelosuppression model to better describe the maturation of megakaryocytes into platelets before degradation and a feedback mechanism. The model employed a proportional error model to describe the observed circulating platelet data. Several covariates were explored , including sex , body<symptom> weight , UGT1A1 genotype status , liver , and kidney function , but none significantly improved the model. Platelet levels rebounded to baseline within 21 days , before the next cycle of therapy. Simulations predicted that higher belinostat drug exposure does cause lower thrombocyte nadirs compared to lower belinostat levels. However , platelet levels rebound by the start of the next belinostat cycle. This model suggests a q3week schedule allows for sufficient platelet recovery before the next belinostat infusion is optimal.
