  The purpose of this study is to review the current knowledge on the damage-induced molecular programs that underlie the regenerative ability in zebrafish brain. Neural stem cells are the reservoir for new neurons during development and regeneration of the vertebrate brains. Pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases hamper neural stem cell plasticity and neurogenic outcome in humans , whereas adult zebrafish brain can enhance proliferation and neurogenic capacity of its neural stem cells despite the incipient pathology. Evidence suggests that zebrafish uses damage-induced molecular programs to enable neural stem cells to efficiently initiate regeneration. Since this aptitude may be harnessed for regenerative therapies in human brain , understanding the molecular programs regulating neural stem cell proliferation and quiescence in zebrafish is of utmost importance for clinical efforts. Specific molecular programs that are different than those in the homeostatic conditions regulate adult zebrafish neural stem cell plasticity and the regenerative capacity after injury and neurodegeneration. These programs can serve as candidates for stem cell-based regenerative therapies in humans.
