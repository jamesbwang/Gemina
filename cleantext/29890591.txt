  Globally , it is estimated that ~ 1500PgC of organic carbon is stored in the top meter of terrestrial soils. This represents the largest terrestrial pool of carbon. Appropriate management of soils , to maintain or increase the soil carbon pool , represents a significant climate change mitigation opportunity. To achieve this , appropriate tools and models are required in order to more accurately estimate soil carbon fluxes with a view to informing and developing more effective land use management strategies. Central to this is the evaluation of models currently in use to estimate soil carbon emissions. In the present study , we evaluate the ECOSSE ( Estimating Carbon in Organic Soils- Sequestration and Emissions) model which has its origins in both SUNDIAL and RothC and has been widely used globally to model soil CO
