  Fluorescent nanodiamonds ( FNDs) having nitrogen-vacancy ( NV) centers have drawn much attention for their biocompatibility and stable optical properties. Nevertheless , the NV centers are located in the interior of the FNDs , and it has not been possible to increase the fluorescence intensity of FNDs efficiently using previously developed enhancement methods. In this paper , we present a simple nanocavity structure that enhances the fluorescence intensity of FNDs. The designed Al/SiO2 nanocavities are stable and inexpensive , and provide a large region for efficient enhancement of fluorescence that can cover most 100 nm FNDs. By tuning the thickness of the capping SiO2 layer of the Al/SiO2 nanocavities , the distributions of both the spatial and spectral electric field intensities of the FNDs could be controlled and manipulated. In general , the FNDs were excited using a green-yellow laser; the broadband fluorescence of the FNDs comprised the emissions from neutral ( NV0) and negatively charged ( NV-) NV centers. To enhance the fluorescence intensity from the NV- centers of the FNDs , we designed an Al/70 nm SiO2 nanocavity to function at excitation and emission wavelengths of 633 and 710 nm , respectively , allowing the NV- centers to be excited efficiently; as a result , we achieved an enhancement in fluorescence intensity of 11.2-fold. Moreover , even when we covered 100 nm FNDs with polyglycerol ( forming p-FND) , the fluorescence intensities of the p-FND particles placed on the nanocavities remained greatly enhanced.
