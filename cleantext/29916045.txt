  Scalp lesions<symptom> are common pediatric findings that present for neurosurgical evaluation and management. The majority will be benign. Meningothelial hamartomas represent a rare subset of congenital cutaneous lesions<symptom> with the potential for intracranial extension and microscopic infiltration of the surrounding tissues. The authors report in this paper a case of meningothelial hamartoma of the scalp that demonstrated serial growth and invasion of the scalp. The degree of microscopic involvement and growth necessitated close follow-up and repeat excision.
