  There are abundant cattle breeds/populations in China , and the systematic discovery of genomic variants is essential for performing the marker assisted selection and conservation of genetic resources. In the present study , we employed whole transcriptome sequencing ( RNA-Seq) technology for revealing genetic structure among six Chinese cattle populations according to transcriptome-wide SNPs and gene expression. A total of 68,094 variants consisting of 61,754 SNPs and 6340 InDels were detected and widely distributed among all chromosomes , by which the clear patterns of population structures were revealed. We also found the significantly differential density of variant distribution among genes. Additionally , we totally assembled 15,992 genes and detected obvious differences on the expression profiles among populations. In contrast to genomic variants , the measure of gene expression levels failed to support the expected population structure. Here , we provided a global landscape on the differential expression genes among these cattle populations.
