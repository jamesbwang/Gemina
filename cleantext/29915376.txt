  Presenilin-1 ( PSEN1) is the catalytic subunit of the γ-secretase complex , and pathogenic mutations in the PSEN1 gene account for the majority cases of familial AD ( FAD). FAD-associated mutant PSEN1 proteins have been shown to affect APP processing and Aβ generation and inhibit Notch1 cleavage and Notch signaling. In this report , we found that a PSEN1 mutation ( S169del) altered APP processing and Aβ generation , and promoted neuritic plaque formation as well as learning and memory deficits in AD model mice. However , this mutation did not affect Notch1 cleavage and Notch signaling in vitro and in vivo. Taken together , we demonstrated that PSEN1
