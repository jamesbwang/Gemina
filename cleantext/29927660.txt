  In 2004 , MÃ¤lardalen University , Sweden , introduced a new undergraduate entry-level physiotherapy program. Program developers constructed the curriculum with behavioral medicine content that reflected the contemporary definition and values of the physiotherapy profession aligning it with current best practices , evidence , and the International Classification of Functioning , Disability , and Health ( ICF). The new curriculum conceptualized movement and function as modifiable behaviors in that they reflect behavioral contingencies , perceptions , beliefs , and lifestyle factors as well as pathophysiology and environmental factors. The purpose of this article is to describe how one university accordingly structured its new curriculum and its review. We describe the rationale for the curriculum 's behavioral medicine content and competencies , its development and implementation , challenges , long-term outcomes , and its related research enterprise. We conclude that physiotherapy practiced by our graduates augments that taught in other programs based on accreditation reviews. With their expanded practice scope , graduates are systematically practicing within the constructs of health and function conceptualized within the ICF. Our intent in sharing our experience is to exemplify one university 's initiative to best prepare students with respect to maximizing physiotherapy outcomes as well as establish a dialogue regarding minimum standards of behavioral medicine competencies in physiotherapy education and practice.
