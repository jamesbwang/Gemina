  Since the 1970s , the northern part of Côte d'Ivoire has experienced considerable fluctuation in its meteorology including a general decrease of rainfall and increase of temperature from 1970 to 2000 , a slight increase of rainfall since 2000 , a severe drought in 2004-2005 and flooding in 2006-2007. Such changing climate patterns might affect the transmission of malaria<disease> The purpose of this study was to analyze climate and environmental parameters associated with malaria<disease> transmission in Korhogo , a city in northern Côte d'Ivoire. All data were collected over a 10-year period ( 2004-2013). Rainfall , temperature and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( NDVI) were the climate and environmental variables considered. Association between these variables and clinical malaria<disease> data was determined , using negative binomial regression models. From 2004 to 2013 , there was an increase in the annual average precipitation ( 1100.3-1376.5 mm) and the average temperature ( 27.2 °C -27.5 °C). The NDVI decreased from 0.42 to 0.40. We observed a strong seasonality in these climatic variables , which resembled the seasonality in clinical malaria<disease> An incremental increase of 10 mm of monthly precipitation was , on average , associated with a 1 % ( 95 % Confidence interval ( CI): 0.7 to 1.2 %) and a 1.2 % ( 95 % CI: 0.9 to 1.5 %) increase in the number of clinical malaria<disease> episodes one and two months later respectively. A 1 °C increase in average monthly temperature was , on average , associated with a decline of a 3.5 % ( 95 % CI: 0.1 to 6.7 %) in clinical malaria<disease> episodes. A 0.1 unit increase in monthly NDVI was associated with a 7.3 % ( 95 % CI: 0.8 to 14.1 %) increase in the monthly malaria<disease> count. There was a similar increase for the preceding-month lag ( 6.7 % ( 95 % CI: 2.3 % to 11.2 %)). The study results can be used to establish a malaria<disease> early warning system in Korhogo to prepare for outbreaks of malaria<disease> , which would increase community resilience no matter the magnitude and pattern of climate change.
