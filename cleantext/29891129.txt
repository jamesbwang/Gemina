  Hemophilic arthropathy of the ankle is an extremely unique condition that affects a small subset of the population in the United States. We present the case of a 66-year-old male with factor XI deficiency , which , over years of repetitive microtrauma as a professional soccer player , led to multiple hemarthrosis and severe arthropathy of his right ankle. The patient successfully underwent total ankle replacement arthroplasty and was able to return to recreational sports and competitive road cycling.
