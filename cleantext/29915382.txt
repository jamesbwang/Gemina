  To examine the impact of a targeted exome approach for the molecular diagnosis of patients nationwide with a wide range of ataxia-related phenotypes. One hundred and seventy patients with ataxia<symptom> of unknown etiology referred from clinics throughout the United States and Canada were studied using a targeted exome approach. Patients ranged in age from 2 to 88 years. Analysis was focused on 441 curated genes associated with ataxia<symptom> and ataxia-like conditions. Pathogenic and suspected diagnostic variants were identified in 88 of the 170 patients , providing a positive molecular diagnostic rate of 52 %. Forty-six different genes were implicated , with the six most commonly mutated genes being SPG7 , SYNE1 , ADCK3 , CACNA1A , ATP1A3 , and SPTBN2 , which accounted for > 40 % of the positive cases. In many cases a diagnosis was provided for conditions that were not suspected and resulted in the broadening of the clinical spectrum of several conditions. Exome sequencing with targeted analysis provides a high-yield approach for the genetic diagnosis of ataxia-related conditions. This is the largest targeted exome study performed to date in patients with ataxia<symptom> and ataxia-like conditions and represents patients with a wide range of ataxia<symptom> phenotypes typically encountered in neurology and genetics clinics.
