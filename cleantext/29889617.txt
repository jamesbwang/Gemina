  To test whether three cognitive-affective correlates , mindfulness , emotion reactivity , and depressive symptom severity , have different associations with current suicidal ideation ( SI) , a history of suicide attempt ( SA) and SA+SI among emerging adults. To test whether impulsive-aggression ( IA) moderates associations between cognitive-affective correlates of suicidal behavior and suicidality. Survey data on current SI , SA history , mindfulness , emotion reactivity , depressive symptom severity , and IA were collected from 780 emerging adults. Results from multinomial logistic regression analysis showed greater depressive symptom severity among emerging adults with current SI , regardless of SA history. Those with a history of SA reported greater depressive symptom severity and less mindfulness than controls. IA did not moderate relationships of SI and/or SA and mindfulness , emotion reactivity , or depressive symptom severity. Mindfulness is a marker of SA , and depressive symptom severity is associated with current SI and SA history in emerging adults. IA does not moderate these associations. To the extent that a history of SA is indicative of elevated trait-like suicide risk and SI indicates state suicidality , our findings suggest that mindfulness protects against longer-term vulnerability to SA while depressive symptom severity increases with increasing suicide state-trait risk.
