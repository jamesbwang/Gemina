  A chytridiomycosis outbreak from Batrachochytrium<pathogen> dendrobatidis ( Bd) in a mixed-species plethodontid salamander exhibit resulted in four green salamander ( Aneides aeneus) deaths. One green salamander died before treatment , and three died during treatment with daily 0.005 % itraconazole baths. All salamanders had evidence of severe Bd infections via cytology , histopathology , and/or polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) at the time of death. Ten long-tailed salamanders ( Eurycea longicauda) and one two-lined salamander ( Eurycea bislineata) that shared the enclosure were initially negative for Bd on quantitative PCR but were prophylactically treated with daily 0.01 % itraconazole baths for 11 days. Posttreatment testing yielded eight long-tailed salamanders and one two-lined salamander positive for Bd with low gene equivalents. All salamanders were negative after two to three treatment courses , and there were no additional mortalities. The difference in mortality and fungal load suggested that genus Aneides salamanders may be more susceptible to Bd than genus Eurycea salamanders.
