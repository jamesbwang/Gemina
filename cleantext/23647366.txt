  We examine the DNA polymerase β ( pol β) transition state ( TS) from a leaving group pre-steady-state kinetics perspective by measuring the rate of incorporation of dNTPs and corresponding novel β,γ-CXY-dNTP analogues , including individual β,γ-CHF and- CHCl diastereomers with defined stereochemistry at the bridging carbon , during the formation of right ( R) and wrong ( W) base pairs.
