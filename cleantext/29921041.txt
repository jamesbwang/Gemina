  Striae distensae are very common cutaneous disorders that produce great psychological stress for women. measure and compare between efficacy and tolerability of three modalities for treatment of striae distensae. Forty-five female patients with striae distensae were randomly selected from the outpatient dermatology clinics of Al-Zahra university Hospital within 6 months period. Patients divided into three groups according to the therapeutic modalities were used. Group A: treated with carboxytherapy using carbon dioxide ( CO2) injection , Group B: where patients were treated with intradermal injection of autologous platelet-rich plasma ( PRP) , and Group C: where we used tripolar radiofrequency ( RF) for treatment. All treated groups showed overall clinical improvement as regards the width , texture , and overall improvement after treatment ( P > .05) , with no statistically significant differences between the three groups. Patient 's satisfaction was statistically significantly better in both group C ( 93.33 %) and group A ( 80 %) while group B ( 53.33 %) was less with minimal side effects such as pain and ecchymosis , which were more frequent in group B than the other two groups; but with no statistically significance differences both groups A and C were effective with no significant differences in both types of striae and in any site of the body but group B is significantly more effective on striae rubra on trunk , with better improvement of lesions<symptom> texture. The three modalities of treatments proved to be effective clinically and histopathologically in treating both types of striae , which were well tolerated by the patients with minimal , transient side effects and our study results gave us guidelines for their clinical application.
