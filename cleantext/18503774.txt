  Nuclear receptors , such as the farnesoid X receptor ( FXR) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma and alpha ( PPAR- & gamma; ,- & alpha ;-RRB- , are major metabolic regulators in adipose tissue and the liver , where they govern lipid , glucose , and bile acid homeostasis , as well as inflammatory cascades. Glycerol and free fatty acids are the end products of lipid droplet catabolism driven by PPARs. Aquaporins ( AQPs) , a family of 13 small transmembrane proteins , facilitate the shuttling of water , urea , and/or glycerol. The peculiar role of AQPs in glycerol transport makes them pivotal targets in lipid metabolism , especially considering their tissue-specific regulation by the nuclear receptors PPAR & gamma; and PPAR & alpha;. Here , we review the role of nuclear receptors in the regulation of glycerol shuttling in liver and adipose tissue through the function and expression of AQPs.
