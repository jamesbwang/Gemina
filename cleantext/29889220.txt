  Approximately 60-80 % of patients with congenital central hypothyroidism ( CH-C) have multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies ( MPHD) , making CH-C a potentially life-threatening disease. Data on mortality in CH-C patients , however , are lacking. To study mortality rate in early detected and treated pediatric CH-C patients in the Netherlands and to investigate whether causes of death were related to pituitary hormone deficiencies. Overall mortality rate , infant mortality rate and under-5 mortality rate were calculated in all children with CH-C detected by neonatal screening between 1-1-1995 and 1-1-2013. Medical charts were reviewed to establish causes of death. 139 children with CH-C were identified , of which 138 could be traced ( 82 MPHD/56 isolated CHC). Total observation time was 1414 years with a median follow up duration of 10.2 years. The overall mortality rate was 10.9 % ( 15/138). Infant mortality rate ( IMR) and under-5 mortality rate were 65.2/ 1000 ( 9/138) and 101.4/ 1000 ( 14/138) , respectively , compared to an IMR of 4.7/ 1000 and under-5 mortality of 5.4/ 1000 live born children in the Netherlands during the same time period ( p < 0.0001). Main causes of death were severe congenital malformations in six patients , asphyxia in two patients , and congenital or early neonatal<disease> infection<disease> in two patients. Pituitary hormone deficiency was noted as cause of death in only one infant. We report an increased mortality rate in early detected CH-C patients which does not seem to be related to endocrine disease. This suggests that mortality due to pituitary insufficiency is low in an early detected and treated CH-C population.
