  Iodine deficiency is a global issue that is correlated with a variety of diseases and can affect individuals of all ages. We hypothesized that a general , semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ) could be a valuable tool to evaluate iodine intake in children. Study participants comprised 687 healthy children between the ages of 7 and 13 years. The FFQ was developed to assess habitual iodine intake over a 6-month period ( FFQ1). A 3-day estimated food diary ( 3DEFD) and the habitual daily iodine intake , calculated from 2-repeated 24-hour urine iodine excretion , tested the intermethod relative validity of the FFQ. There were 92 children who also repeated the FFQ ( FFQ2) 3 weeks later to assess for FFQ reproducibility. Iodine intake estimated by FFQ1 + water was significantly higher than that indicated by the 3DEFD + water ( 204 μg/d vs 156 μg/d , P < .001) , whereas there were no differences between habitual daily iodine intake and FFQ1 + water ( 185 μg/d vs 204 μg/d , P = .223). The interclass correlation coefficients of iodine intake estimated by the FFQ1 and FFQ2 were 0.72 ( P < .001). The FFQ1 + water was moderately correlated with the 3DEFD + water ( Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.57 , P < .001) as well as habitual daily iodine intake ( SCC = 0.34 , P < .001). The subjects classified into the same or adjacent quartiles ranged from 32 % to 93 %. The κ value α was 0.46 for FFQ1 and FFQ2 ( P < .001) 0.27 for FFQ1 + water and 3DEFD + water ( P < .001) , and 0.09 for FFQ1 + water and habitual daily iodine intake ( P < .001). The results showed this FFQ is a reliable and reproducible tool in evaluating iodine intake in Chinese children.
