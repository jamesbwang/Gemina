  Computational determination of peptide conformations is challenging as it is a problem of finding minima in a high-dimensional space. The `` divide and conquer '' approach is promising for reliably reducing the search space size. A random forest<disease> learning model is proposed here to expand the scope of applicability of the `` divide and conquer '' approach. A random forest<disease> classification algorithm is used to characterize the distributions of the backbone φ-ψ units ( `` words ''). A random forest<disease> supervised learning model is developed to analyze the combinations of the φ-ψ units ( `` grammar ''). It is found that amino acid residues may be grouped as equivalent `` words '' , while the φ-ψ combinations in low-energy peptide conformations follow a distinct `` grammar ''. The finding of equivalent words empowers the `` divide and conquer '' method with the flexibility of fragment substitution. The learnt grammar is used to improve the efficiency of the `` divide and conquer '' method by removing unfavorable φ-ψ combinations without the need of dedicated human effort. The machine learning assisted search method is illustrated by efficiently searching the conformations of GGG/AAA/GGGG/ AAAA/GGGGG through assembling the structures of GFG/GFGG. Moreover , the computational cost of the new method is shown to increase rather slowly with the peptide length.
