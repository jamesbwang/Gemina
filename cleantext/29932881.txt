  Most patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD) present with proteinuria<symptom> and extracellular matrix ( ECM) deposition in the interstitium. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2) is important for maintaining ECM metabolism and it affects the formation and development of CKD. Autophagy has been reported to be protective against renal tubular injury , but the role of autophagy related to ECM metabolism is unclear. Rab7 is a shared molecule of endocytosis and autophagy. The aim of this study is to explore the role of autophagy in regulating MMP-2 activity and to determine whether Rab7 functions in regulating MMP-2 activity and injury in albumin-overloaded TECs. In this study , abovine serum albumin ( BSA)- overload rat model was first established and collagen deposition and deficient autophagic response were observed in vivo , and stimulation with albumin nanoparticles resulted in MMP-2 overactivation and obstructed autophagic flux induced by lysosomal dysfunction in vitro. Furthermore , overactivation of MMP-2 was mediated by its related regulatory molecules such as membrane-type 1 MMP ( MT1-MMP) , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 ( TIMP-2) and reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs ( RECK) on the membrane of TECs ( HK-2 cellline). After up-regulating Rab7 , albumin-induced MMP-2 overactivation was attenuated , which was reversed by chloroquine ( CQ; an endocytosis inhibitor). In addition , our data indicated that up-regulation of Rab7 relieved epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) and apoptosis in albumin-treated TECs. Taken together , our study demonstrated that autophagy regulates MMP-2 activity in a Rab7-dependent manner. Thus , Rab7 is a newly developed target for protecting TECs from albumin-induced injury.
