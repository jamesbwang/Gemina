  Herpes<disease> zoster<disease> , caused by varicella zoster<disease> virus ( VZV) reactivation , affects mainly the adult population , although it can occur in children. This happens when primary infection ( varicella) has occurred at a very young age or in immunocompromised patients. Complications are rare in healthy individuals. They include VZV cutaneous dissemination , which affects 2 % -10 % of immunocompromised patients.We present a previously healthy child , with history of varicella during her first month of life , which presented at age 8 with a severe case of herpes<disease> zoster<disease> , complicated with cutaneous dissemination. Immunity study was unremarkable. Causes , management and follow-up are discussed.
