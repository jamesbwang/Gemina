  Traffic accidents have become an important problem for governments , researchers and vehicle manufacturers over the last few decades. However , accidents are unfortunate and frequently occur on the road and cause death , damage to infrastructure , and health injuries. Therefore , there is a need to develop a protocol to avoid or prevent traffic accidents at the extreme level in order to reduce human loss. The aim of this research is to develop a new protocol , named as the Traffic Accidents Reduction Strategy ( TARS) , for Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks ( VANETs) to minimize the number of road accidents , decrease the death rate caused by road accidents , and for the successful deployment of the Intelligent Transportation System ( ITS). We have run multiple simulations and the results showed that our proposed scheme has outperformed DBSR and POVRP routing protocols in terms of the Message Delivery Ratio ( MDR) , Message Loss Ratio ( MLR) , Average Delay , and Basic Safety Message.
