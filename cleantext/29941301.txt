  Inadequate weight<symptom> loss<symptom> , weight recidivism , and device-related complications after an adjustable gastric banding ( AGB) can be treated by a laparoscopic conversion to stomach intestinal pylorus-sparing surgery ( SIPS). The aim of the study was to analyze the midterm outcomes of revision SIPS surgery after failed AGB. Private practice , United States. This is a retrospective review of our prospectively collected data of patients who underwent laparoscopic conversion from AGB to SIPS surgery from June 2013 and February 2017 by a single surgeon in a single institution. Twenty-seven patients ( 1 stage: 22 and 2 stage: 5) underwent a laparoscopic revision of AGB to SIPS surgery. The mean ± standard deviation preoperative body mass index ( BMI) before AGB was 47.5 ± 6.8 kg/m This study demonstrates that conversion of failed AGB to SIPS surgery is an effective approach to AGB failure.
