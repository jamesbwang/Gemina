  Molecular estimates of the divergence of placental and marsupial mammals and their broader clades ( Eutheria and Metatheria , respectively) fall primarily in the Jurassic period. Supporting these estimates , Juramaia-the oldest purported eutherian-is from the early Late Jurassic ( 160 million years ago) of northeastern China. Sinodelphys-the oldest purported metatherian-is from the same geographic area but is 35 million years younger , from the Jehol biota. Here we report a new Jehol eutherian , Ambolestes zhoui , with a nearly complete skeleton that preserves anatomical details that are unknown from contemporaneous mammals , including the ectotympanic and hyoid apparatus. This new fossil demonstrates that Sinodelphys is a eutherian , and that postcranial differences between Sinodelphys and the Jehol eutherian Eomaia-previously thought to indicate separate invasions of a scansorial niche by eutherians and metatherians-are instead variations among the early members of the placental lineage. The oldest known metatherians are now not from eastern Asia but are 110 million years old from western<pathogen> North<pathogen> America , which produces a 50-million-year ghost lineage for Metatheria.
