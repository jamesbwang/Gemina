  Many diet quality scores exist , but fully food-based scores based on contemporary evidence are scarce. Our aim was to develop a food-based diet score based on international literature and examine its discriminative capacity and socio-demographic determinants. Between 2006 and 2013 , dietary intake of 129,369 participants of the Lifelines Cohort ( 42 % male , 45 Â± 13 years ( range 18-93)) was assessed with a 110-item food frequency questionnaire. Based on the 2015 Dutch Dietary Guidelines and underlying literature , nine food groups with positive ( vegetables , fruit , whole grain products , legumes & nuts , fish , oils & soft margarines , unsweetened dairy , coffee and tea) and three food groups with negative health effects ( red & processed meat , butter & hard margarines and sugar-sweetened beverages) were identified. Per food group , the intake in grams per 1000 kcal was categorized into quintiles , awarded 0 to 4 points ( negative groups scored inversely) and summed. Food groups with neutral , unknown or inconclusive evidence are described but not included. The Lifelines Diet Score ( LLDS) discriminated well between high and low consumers of included food groups. This is illustrated by e.g. a 2-fold higher vegetable intake in the highest , compared to the lowest LLDS quintile. Differences were 5.5-fold for fruit , 3.5-fold for fish , 3-fold for dairy and 8-fold for sugar-sweetened beverages. The LLDS was higher in females and positively associated with age and educational level. The LLDS is based on the latest international evidence for diet-disease relations at the food group level and has high capacity to discriminate people with widely different intakes. Together with the population-based quintile approach , this makes the LLDS a flexible , widely applicable tool for diet quality assessment.
