  High fat diet-induced changes in gut microbiota have been linked to intestinal permeability and metabolic endotoxemia , which is related to metabolic disorders. However , the influence of a high-glucose ( HGD) or high-fructose ( HFrD) diet on gut microbiota is largely unknown. We performed changes of gut microbiota in HGD- or HFrD-fed C57BL/6J mice by 16S rRNA analysis. Gut microbiota-derived endotoxin-induced metabolic disorders were evaluated by glucose and insulin tolerance test , gut permeability , Western blot and histological analysis. We found that the HGD and HFrD groups had comparatively higher blood glucose and endotoxin levels , fat mass , dyslipidemia , and glucose intolerance without changes in bodyweight. The HGD- and HFrD-fed mice lost gut microbial diversity , characterized by a lower proportion of Bacteroidetes and a markedly increased proportion of Proteobacteria. Moreover , the HGD and HFrD groups had increased gut permeability due to alterations to the tight junction proteins caused by gut inflammation<symptom>. Hepatic inflammation<symptom> and lipid accumulation were also markedly increased in the HGD and HFrD groups. High levels of glucose or fructose in the diet regulate the gut microbiota and increase intestinal permeability , which precedes the development of metabolic endotoxemia , inflammation<symptom> , and lipid accumulation , ultimately leading to hepatic steatosis and normal-weight obesity.
