  The CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib is a new standard treatment in hormone-receptor positive breast cancer patients. No predictive biomarkers have been identified and no pharmacodynamics has properly been described so far. Patients with early breast cancer were randomized 3:1 to oral palbociclib 125 mg daily for 14 days until the day before the surgery vs. no treatment. Primary objective was antiproliferative response defined as a natural logarithm of Ki67 expression at day 15 below 1. Secondary end-points were subgroups analyses and safety. Exploratory analyses included search for predictive biomarkers. Immunostainings ( Ki67 , RB , pRB , p16 , pAKT , pER , pCDK2 , CyclinD1) , FISH ( CCND1) and gene expression arrays were performed at baseline and at surgery. In addition , activating PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations were assessed at baseline. 74 patients were allocated to palbociclib and 26 to control. Most patients ( 93 %) were hormone-receptor ( HR)- positive , whereas 8 % were HER2-positive. Palbociclib led to significantly more antiproliferative responses as compared to control ( 58 % vs. 12 % , p < 0.001) , and to a significantly higher Ki67 decrease ( p < 0.001). In the HR-positive/HER2-negative subgroup , this antiproliferative effect was even more marked in the palbociclib arm as compared to control ( 70 % vs. 9 % , p < 0.001). Palbociclib treatment led also to a significantly higher decrease from baseline in phospho-Rb as compared to control ( p < 0.001). Among treated patients , changes in Ki67 correlated with changes in phospho-Rb ( Spearman rank r = 0.41 , p < 0.0001). Gene expression analyses confirmed a major effect on proliferation and cell cycle genes. Among treated patients , CCNE2 expression was significantly more decreased in anti-proliferative responders vs. non-responders ( p = 0.006). Short-term pre-operative palbociclib decreases Ki67 in early breast cancer patients. Early decrease of Rb phosphorylation correlates with drug 's effect on cell proliferation and could potentially identify patients with primary resistance.
