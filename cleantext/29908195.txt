  Utilizing our standardized approach to air leak reduction ( STAR) protocol has led to a continual decrease in the need for inpatient recovery following lobectomy. Although next day discharges do occur , the current literature has n't addressed their safety. We analyzed our STAR dataset to study this group and their outcomes. A retrospective review of prospectively collected data from the STAR dataset was performed. Characteristics were compared between patients discharged on postoperative day ( POD) 1 and those with longer admissions. Outcome data was analyzed. From June 2010 through June 2017 , 390 patients underwent lobectomy and met study criteria. Of these , 150 ( 38 %) were discharged on POD 1 versus 240 ( 62 %) who were discharged later ( mean LOS 3.9 days). There was no increase in morbidity , mortality or 30-day readmission between the two groups. Distinguishing characteristics of the POD 1 group included more non-smokers , use of a minimally invasive technique , and a lower incidence of prolonged air leak. FEV1 and DLCO data were also favorable in the POD 1 group. The percentage of patients sent home POD 1 increased from an average of 23 % over the first three years of the study to 63 % over the last three years. Appropriately identified patients can safely go home on POD 1 following lobectomy without an increase in 30-day readmission , morbidity or mortality. A continued focus on lobectomy LOS reduction has the capacity to increase patient satisfaction and lead to reduction in healthcare costs.
