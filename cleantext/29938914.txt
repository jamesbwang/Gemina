  Few population-representative studies have examined dietary supplement use among Americans with diabetes mellitus ( DM). This investigation analyzed dietary supplementation and DM data from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES). Data from 5040 adult participants were analyzed , including 639 participants reporting a diagnosis of DM ( Method 1) , which increased to 1036 after including participants reporting `` borderline '' DM or prediabetes ( Method 2). Participants reported dietary supplements used over the past month. The prevalence of supplementation was compared among participants with and without DM using the Rao-Scott likelihood Chi-squared test; multivariate logistic regression was used to examine whether DM was an independent predictor of supplementation. Regardless of whether Method 1 or Method 2 was used , dietary supplementation was more prevalent among participants with DM ( Method 1 , 61.4 % vs. 54.4 % , P = 0.024; Method 2 , 62.7 % vs. 53.5 % , P < 0.001). After adjusting for a variety of demographic and health-related variables , the presence of DM was no longer associated with supplementation for Method 1 ( odds ratio ( OR) 1.01; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.78-1.32; P = 0.925) or Method 2 ( OR 1.13; 95 % CI 0.91-1.41; P = 0.238). Approximately four of every five products taken for the purpose of managing DM were self-prescribed , the most common being multivitamins-minerals , cinnamon-containing supplements , and chromium-containing supplements. Slightly more than six out of 10 Americans with DM use dietary supplements each month and , although this is higher than Americans without DM , it does not appear to be due to DM per se.
