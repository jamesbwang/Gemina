  Dogs may cause zoonoses and damages; especially when we accept as normal some dangerous behavior , losing the perception of disease risk. The purpose of this review was to demonstrate that the presence of stray dogs as well as community dogs , are public health hazard. Through sustainable epidemiological information , we believe this measure could prevent it from spreading. Dog 's aggressiveness regulates its social relationships through submission or dominance; those characteristics are difficult to be recognized by human population. In Chile , 327.150 people were bitten by dogs , between years 2003 and 2012 with a cost of USD$ 22.7 to USD$ 177,9 million in addition to the USD$ 3,13 million for the surgical intervention of 767 human subjects of Hydatidosis during 2012. However zoonosis more dangerous is Rabies<pathogen> with death results. As a conclusion we state that the presence of stray and community dogs in the streets can not be tolerated. This measure must have a sustainable technical of Health and Public safety because population have lost its ability of recognize the risk of contracting zoonotic diseases , with high costs for the health care system , besides the economical decline and psychological damage to the affected individuals.
