  The concept of an invisibility cloak is a fixture of science fiction , fantasy , and the collective imagination. However , a real device that can hide an object from sight in visible light from absolutely any viewpoint would be extremely challenging to build. The main obstacle to creating such a cloak is the coupling of the electromagnetic components of light , which would necessitate the use of complex materials with specific permittivity and permeability tensors. Previous cloaking solutions have involved circumventing this obstacle by functioning either in static ( or quasistatic) fields where these electromagnetic components are uncoupled or in diffusive light scattering media where complex materials are not required. In this paper , concealing a large-scale spherical object from human sight from three orthogonal directions is reported. This result is achieved by developing a 3D homogeneous polyhedral transformation and a spatially invariant refractive index discretization that considerably reduce the coupling of the electromagnetic components of visible light. This approach allows for a major simplification in the design of 3D invisibility cloaks , which can now be created at a large scale using homogeneous and isotropic materials.
