  Post-germination desiccation tolerance ( DT) was studied in two wheat cultivars. Effect of pretreatment of abscisic acid ( ABA)/ osmotic/ salt/ heat stress was also studied. One day ( d)- old seedlings of wheat cultivars PBW 644 ( drought tolerant) and PBW 343 ( drought susceptible) were exposed to ABA/stress treatment for next 1 d , desiccated for 4 d and subsequently rehydrated for 4 d. Biomass , protein , water , protein carbonyls ( oxidative toxicity) and nitric oxide ( NO) levels were measured in 2 d ( treated) , 6 d ( desiccated) , 10 d ( rehydrated) seedlings. Vegetative reactive oxygen species ( ROS)/ NO-pathways were studied under normal condition and ABA supply by supplying ROS/NO scavengers. Desiccation caused water loss and increased oxidative toxicity. PBW 644 showed very low level of toxicity but higher loss of water under desiccation. ABA/ stress pretreatment further reduced water level under desiccation and reduced biomass upon rehydration in PBW 644 only. On the other hand , PBW 343 did not show higher decrease of water but showed high toxicity under desiccation where ABA/stress pretreatment improved this response by increasing biomass upon rehydration. This indicated that PBW 644 used metabolic arrest under desiccation for survival while PBW 343 used growth promotive mode. ABA/ROS/NO-pathways were operational in both cultivars.
