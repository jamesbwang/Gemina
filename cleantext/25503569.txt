  The mechanism of methane activation on Mo/HZSM -5 is not yet fully understood , despite the great interest in methane dehydroaromatization ( MDA) to replace aromatics production in oil refineries. It is difficult to assess the exact nature of the active site due to fast coking. By pre-carburizing Mo/HZSM -5 with carbon monoxide ( CO) , the MDA active site formation was isolated from coke formation. With this a clear
