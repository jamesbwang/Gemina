  We describe a case report of a 53-year-old man with a 5-months history of progressive jaundice and upper<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom>. The patient was further evaluated and finally diagnosed with a high-grade ampullary neuroendocrine tumour ( based on endoscopic-guided biopsy). Thereafter , he underwent pancreatoduodenectomy and adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. This extremely rare case presents his long-lasting disease-free survival compared with similar cases; this case report exemplifies a new , potentially efficient method for treating high-grade papillary neuroendocrine tumour and may pave the way for further clinical trials utilising this blueprint in the treatment of related conditions.
