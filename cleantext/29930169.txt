  Presented here is the case of an 86-year-old man who was found to have right-sided pelvicalyceal rupture and anuric renal<symptom> failure<symptom> , secondary to obstructive uropathy caused by life-saving extraperitoneal pelvic packing ( EPP) in the settling of severe trauma. In efforts to control haemorrhage in this haemodynamically unstable patient , EPP placement deviated from the recognised method of three extraperitoneal packs bilaterally with seven surgical packs placed. Progress postoperative imaging revealed right-sided hydroureteronephrosis with obstruction evident at the level of the extraperitoneal pelvic packs , identified by delayed contrast excretion from the preceding CT angiography imaging. Urology performed bilateral retrograde pyelograms at his relook laparotomy , timed after removal of his extraperitoneal packs and haemostasis , which showed impression of the surgical pack on the distal ureter but no persisting obstruction or short-term complications. Anuric renal<symptom> failure<symptom> improved , and renal function returned to near premorbid levels on day 4 postoperatively.
