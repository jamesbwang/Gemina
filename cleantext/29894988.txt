  The Current Statistics Self-Efficacy ( CSSE) scale , developed by Finney and Schraw ( 2003) , is a 14-item instrument to assess students ' statistics self-efficacy. No previous research has used the Rasch measurement models to evaluate the psychometric structure of its scores at the item level , and only a few of them have applied the CSSE in a graduate school setting. A modified 30-item CSSE scale was tested on a graduate student population ( N = 179). The Rasch rating scale analysis identified 26 items forming a unidimensional measure. Assumptions of sample-free and test-free measurement were confirmed , showing scores from the CSSE-26 are reliable and valid to assess graduate students ' level of statistics self-efficacy. Findings suggest the CSSE-26 could help facilitate professors ' understanding and enhancement of students ' statistics self-efficacy.
