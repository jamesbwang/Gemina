  Preclinical studies show that opioids promote angiogenesis , tumor progression , and metastasis , resulting in shorter survival. To explore whether opioids are associated with the overall survival ( OS) of patients with incurable nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC). Prospective cohort study of patients with NSCLC. We investigated patients newly diagnosed with advanced or post-operative recurrent NSCLC between April 2013 and December 2015 at a single institute. We evaluated OS , opioid requirements , opioid doses , pain levels , and prognostic factors of advanced NSCLC. The effects of variables on survival were analyzed using univariable and multivariable models. Patients were stratified according to oral morphine equivalents ( OMEs)/ day ( < 60 or ≥ 60 mg) to assess the association between opioid dose and OS. We analyzed 150 patients , including 64 who received opioid treatment during follow-up. The median OS was 242 days in the opioid group and 627 days in the no-opioid group ( log-rank p < 0.001). Multivariable models revealed that the opioid requirement was an independent predictor of shorter OS , after adjustment for prognostic variables , including sex , histology , stage , history of systemic chemotherapy , and performance status ( hazard ratio 1.73 , 95 % confidence interval 1.137-2.631). There was no significant difference in OS between patients who received ≥ 60 mg OME/day for 250 days versus < 60 OME/day for 242 days. The opioid dose does not shorten the survival of patients with advanced NSCLC. The opioid requirement is associated with shorter survival when opioids are administered any time during the clinical course , independent of the influence of other key factors.
