  Although adenosine plays a key role in multiple motor , affective , and cognitive processes , it has received less attention in the neuroscience field compared to other neurotransmitters ( e.g. , dopamine). In this review , we highlight the role of adenosine in behavior as well as its interaction with other neurotransmitters , such as dopamine. We also discuss brain disorders impacted by alterations to adenosine , and how targeting adenosine can ameliorate Parkinson 's disease motor<symptom> symptoms<symptom>. We also discuss the role of caffeine ( as an adenosine antagonist) on cognition as well as a neuroprotective agent against Parkinson 's disease ( PD).
