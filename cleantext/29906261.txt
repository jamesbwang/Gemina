  A better understanding of the genomic changes that facilitate the emergence and spread of drug-resistant Mycobacterium<pathogen> tuberculosis<pathogen> strains is currently required. Here , we report the use of the MinION nanopore sequencer ( Oxford Nanopore Technologies) to sequence and assemble an extensively drug-resistant ( XDR) isolate , which is part of a modern Beijing sub-lineage strain , prevalent in Western Province , Papua New Guinea. Using 238-fold coverage obtained from a single flow-cell , de novo assembly of nanopore reads resulted into one contiguous assembly with 99.92 % assembly accuracy. Incorporation of complementary short read sequences ( Illumina) as part of consensus error correction resulted in a 4 404 064 bp genome with 99.98 % assembly accuracy. This assembly had an average nucleotide identity of 99.7 % relative to the reference genome , H37Rv<pathogen>. We assembled nearly all GC-rich repetitive PE/PPE family genes ( 166/168) and identified variants within these genes. With an estimated genotypic error rate of 5.3 % from MinION data , we demonstrated identification of variants to include the conventional drug resistance mutations , and those that contribute to the resistance phenotype ( efflux pumps/transporter) and virulence. Reference-based alignment of the assembly allowed detection of deletions and insertions. MinION sequencing provided a fully annotated assembly of a transmissible XDR strain from an endemic setting and showed its utility to provide further understanding of genomic processes within
