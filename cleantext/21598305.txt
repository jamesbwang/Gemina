  The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of montmorillonite on nonylphenol ( 4-nonylphenol , 4-NP) enrichment in a zebrafish model. The AB strain zebrafish were used as the animal subjects , and three concentration gradients were set for both nonylphenol and montmorillonite , according to their actual concentrations in aquaculture water in Huzhou City. A group treated with nonylphenol alone was also set , adding up to 12 experimental groups. Concentrations of nonylphenol enriched in the liver , muscle and gills of zebrafish were detected by solid phase microextraction ‚Åª high performance liquid chromatography at Days 7 , 15 and 30 , respectively. Additionally , the relative enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase ( SOD) and the glutathione S-transferase ( GST) were also detected , and the data were statistically analyzed. The results showed that the concentrations of nonylphenol in zebrafish peaked at Day 7 and gradually decreased afterwards for all the experimental groups. The montmorillonite reduces short-term accumulation of nonylphenol in gills , and the high concentration of nonylphenol facilitates its enrichment in liver and muscle , while the low concentration of nonylphenol does not. Meanwhile , the low concentration of nonylphenol in liver exerts an influence on the inductive effect of SOD and GST , while the high concentration of nonylphenol shows the inhibiting effect of SOD and GST.
