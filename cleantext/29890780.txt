  The complete synthesis , optimization , purification , functionalization and evaluation of vertically aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes ( VA-MWCNTs) was reported for potential application in dexamethasone delivery to the ischemic brain tissue. The conditions for high yield were optimized and carbon nanotubes functionalized and PEGylated prior to dexamethasone loading. Morphological changes were confirmed by SEM and TEM. Addition of functional groups to MWCNTs was demonstrated by FTIR. Thermal stability reduced following MWCNTs functionalization as demonstrated in TGA. The presence of carbon at 2 & theta; of 25 & deg; and iron at 2 & theta; of 45 & deg; in MWCNTs was illustrated by XRD. Polydispersive index and zeta potential were found to be 0.261 and & minus; 15.0 mV , respectively. Dexamethasone release increased by 55 % , 65 % and 95 % in pH of 7.4 , 6.5 and 5.5 respectively as evaluated by UV-VIS. The functionalized VA-MWCNTs were demonstrated to be less toxic in PC-12 cells in the concentration range from 20 to 20,000 & micro; g/mL. These findings have demonstrated the potential of VA-MWCNTs in the enhancement of fast and prolonged release of dexamethasone which could lead to the effective treatment of ischemic stroke. More work is under way for targeting ischemic sites using atrial natriuretic peptide antibody in stroke rats.
