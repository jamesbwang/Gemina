  Sacubitril-valsartan is a new medication that has recently been recommended as a replacement for enalapril in the treatment of patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF). This study aimed to determine the cost effectiveness of sacubitril-valsartan compared with enalapril. An analytical decision model was developed to estimate the long-term costs and outcomes from a healthcare perspective. Clinical inputs were mostly derived from the PARADIGM-HF study. Enalapril-related costs , risk of non-cardiovascular death , and all-cause readmission rate were based on data from Thailand. The costs and outcomes were discounted at 3 % annually. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER) was calculated and presented for the year 2017. A series of sensitivity analyses were also performed. For the base-case , the increased cost ( 144,146 vs. 16,048 Thai baht ( THB)) of sacubitril-valsartan was associated with gains in both life-years ( 9.214 vs. 8.367 years) and quality-adjusted life-years ( QALYs) ( 7.698 vs. 6.909) compared with enalapril , yielding an ICER of 162,276 THB/QALY ( $ US4857 .11/ QALY). This ICER is not considered to be cost effective at the willingness-to-pay ( WTP) level of 160,000 THB/QALY. The risk of cardiovascular death and costs of both sacubitril-valsartan and hospitalization influenced the ICER. At a WTP of 160,000 THB/QALY , sacubitril-valsartan had a 48 % probability of being a cost-effective treatment. At its current price in Thailand , sacubitril-valsartan may not represent good value for the nations 's limited healthcare resources. The cost of sacubitril-valsartan needs to reduce by approximately 2 % to yield an ICER below the threshold.
