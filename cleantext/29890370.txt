  Individuals are exposed to influenza<disease> viruses throughout their lifetime. Accumulating evidence shows the first viruses an individual is exposed to leaves an imprint on the antibody response induced by subsequent drifted and novel influenza<disease> viral exposures. Imprinted humoral immunity against influenza<disease> viruses relies on biased immune memory to influenza<disease> viruses for which memory B cell responses were initially generated against. Imprinting allows for antibodies to adapt to drifted influenza<disease> viruses while maintaining binding potential for the first influenza<disease> viruses an individual is exposed to. However , imprinting can increase susceptibility to non-imprinted influenza<disease> viruses and mismatched influenza<disease> viruses. This review highlights the role of imprinting on the regulation of antibody responses induced by influenza<disease> viruses and explores potential vaccine strategies to harness imprinted antibody responses to increase protection against
