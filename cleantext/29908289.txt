  Contractility measurements using primary isolated cardiac myocytes ( CM) have commonly been used in understanding the physiology and pharmacology of cellular mechanics. In the majority of studies , CM from healthy animals were used , and fewer studies were performed with CM from diseased hearts. To better understand the translational value of contractility on the cellular level of a diseased animal model , myocytes were isolated from left ventricles of a tachypacing-induced heart<symptom> failure<symptom> ( HF) canine model , and their contractility was measured by recording sarcomere shortening using an image-based IonOptix video system. A side-by-side comparison study was performed in myocytes isolated from 13 normal and 5 tachypacing-induced HF canines by evaluating both basal contractility and pharmacological responses to inotropic agents with different mechanisms , including dobutamine , isoproterenol , milrinone , levosimendan , pimobendan , diltiazem , and flecainide. Myocytes isolated from HF canines exhibited compromised contractility at the sarcomere level in comparison to normal myocytes , specifically , HF myocytes have smaller sarcomere contraction amplitude , longer resting sarcomere length , slower velocity of contraction and relaxation. In addition , they have altered pharmacological responses compared to that of normal canines , with much less potent effects observed in the application of classic inotropic agents , such as isoproterenol , dobutamine , and milrinone. These results indicate that myocytes isolated from tachy-paced HF canines have altered physiological and pharmacological properties , which could be utilized for understanding pathophysiology and developing pharmacological interventions for HF.
