  Considering the highly complex flow structure of saltwater lakes during freshwater supplementation , a three-dimensional numerical model was developed to simulate suspended sediment transport in saltwater lakes. The model was validated using measurements of the salinity and sediment concentration during a pumping test at Yamdrok Lake. The simulation results were in quantitative agreement with the measured data. The observed and simulated results also indicated that the wind stress and vertical salinity gradient have a significant influence on salinity and sediment transport in a saltwater lake. The validated model was then used to predict and analyze the contributions of wind , the supplement flow rate and salinity stratification to the sediment transport process in Yamdrok Lake during continuous river water supplementation. The simulation results showed that after the sandy river water was continuously discharged into the saltwater lake , the lateral diffusion trends of the sediment exhibited three stages: linear growth in the inflow direction , logarithmic growth in the wind direction , and stabilization. Furthermore , wind was the dominant factor in driving the lake flow pattern and sediment transport. Specifically , wind can effectively reduce the area of the sediment diffusion zone by increasing the lateral sediment carrying and dilution capacities. The effect of inflow on the lake current is negligible , but the extent of the sediment turbidity zone mainly depends on the inflow. Reducing the inflow discharge can decrease the area of the sediment turbidity zone to proportions that far exceed the proportions of inflow discharge reductions. In addition , the high-salinity lake water can support the supplemented freshwater via buoyancy forces , which weaken vertical mixing and sediment settlement and increase lake currents and sediment diffusion near the surface.
