  Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure ( LVEDP) reflects ventricular performance and volume status. We sought to analyze the relationship between LVEDP and the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury ( AKI) in patients with acute coronary syndrome<disease> undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). Between January 2006 and December 2008 , a total of 254 patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome<disease> had the LVEDP assessed prior to the intervention. Contrast-induced AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine â‰¥ 25 % from baseline or an absolute increase of > 0.5 mg/dL from baseline. Patients were divided into three groups according to baseline LVEDP ( < 12 mmHg , 12-20 mmHg and > 20 mmHg). Baseline clinical , angiographic and procedural characteristics , as well as serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) at baseline and at 24 , 48 and 72 h were retrospectively collected. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar in all three groups with the exception of lower left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with elevated LVEDP ( p = 0.02). Among the 17 patients with an LVEDP < 12 mmHg , only one ( 5.9 %) developed AKI; among the 82 patients with an LVEDP = 12-20 mmHg , 15 ( 18.3 %) developed AKI; and among the 155 patients with an LVEDP > 20 mmHg , only 22 developed AKI ( 13.6 %). There was no correlation between LVEDP and the change in GFR at 24 h and at 48 h. Further comparison between the group of patients that developed contrast induced AKI versus those that did not , showed a that there was a significantly lower baseline left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF) among patients that developed contrast induced AKI compared to those that did not ( 41.4 % vs. 48.3 % , p = 0.045 , respectively). In patients with acute coronary syndrome<disease> undergoing PCI , baseline LVEDP was not associated with contrast-induced AKI. However patients with reduced ejection fraction seemed to be at a higher risk of developing AKI. More studies are needed to assess the relationship between LVEDP , LVEF and the risk of developing contrast induced AKI.
