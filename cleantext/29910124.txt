  During reprogramming , telomere re-elongation is important for pluripotency acquisition and ensures the high quality of induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs) , but the regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Our study showed that fully reprogrammed mature iPSCs or mouse embryonic stem cells expressed higher levels of miR-590-3p and miR-590-5p than pre-iPSCs. Ectopic expression of either miR-590-3p or miR-590-5p in pre-iPSCs improved telomere elongation and pluripotency. Activin receptor II A ( Acvr2a) is the downstream target and mediates the function of miR-590. Downregulation of Acvr2a promoted telomere elongation and pluripotency. Overexpression of miR-590 or inhibition of ACTIVIN signaling increased telomeric repeat binding factor 1 ( Terf1) expression. The p-SMAD2 showed increased binding to the Terf1 promoter in pre-iPSCs compared with mature iPSCs. Downregulation of Terf1 blocked miR-590- or shAcvr2a-mediated promotion of telomere elongation and pluripotency in pre-iPSCs. This study elucidated the role of the miR-590/ Acvr2a/Terf1 signaling pathway in modulating telomere elongation and pluripotency in pre-iPSCs.
