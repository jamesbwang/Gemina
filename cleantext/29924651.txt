  The proliferation of new data sources , stemmed from the adoption of open-data schemes , in combination with an increasing computing capacity causes the inception of new type of analytics that process Internet of things with low-cost engines to speed up data processing using parallel computing. In this context , the article presents an initiative , called BIG-Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado ( BOE) , designed to process the Spanish official government gazette ( BOE) with state-of-the-art processing engines , to reduce computation time and to offer additional speed up for big data analysts. The goal of including a big data infrastructure is to be able to process different BOE documents in parallel with specific analytics , to search for several issues in different documents. The application infrastructure processing engine is described from an architectural perspective and from performance , showing evidence on how this type of infrastructure improves the performance of different types of simple analytics as several machines cooperate.
