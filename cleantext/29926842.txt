  In cerebral ischemia , evaluation of multiple biomarkers involved in various pathological pathways is a useful tool in assessing the outcome of the patients even from the early stages of the disease. In this study we investigated the utility of a panel of 5 peripheral biomarkers of inflammatory status , neuronal destruction and secondary fibrinolysis in the acute phase of ischemia , and evaluated the impact of these biomarkers on functional outcome after ischemic stroke. The 5 biomarkers ( plasma CRP , D-Dimers , sTNFR-1 , NGAL and NSE) were measured using a biochip array technology. Eighty nine patients in Romania were divided into 2 subgroups using the modified Rankin Scale evaluated at 3 months after ischemic stroke; the possible impact of analyzed biomarkers on unfavorable functional outcome was tested by binomial logistic regression. The subgroup with unfavorable outcome had higher concentrations of CRP , NGAL , sTNFR-1 and D-dimers , but CRP and NGAL values were not statistically different between the two subgroups. The univariate logistic regression analysis of plasma biomarkers revealed that CRP , D-Dimers , NGAL , sTNFR-1 were significant predictors of unfavorable clinical outcome. In the case of D-Dimers and sTNFR-1 we noticed an increased discrimination ability ( versus baseline clinical model) to classify poor functional outcome with a tendency toward statistical signification. During the acute phase of the ischemic stroke , plasma concentrations of CRP , D-Dimers and sTNFR-1 were elevated in unfavorable outcome patients. D-Dimers and sTNFR-1 were independent predictors of poor outcome at 3 months after ischemic stroke. The biochip array technology offers the possibility to simultaneously measure several parameters involved in multiple pathophysiological pathways , in a small sample volume.
