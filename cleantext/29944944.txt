  Bactrocera tsuneonis ( Miyake) , generally known as the Japanese orange fly , is considered to be a major pest of commercial citrus crops. It has a limited distribution in China , Japan and Vietnam , but it has the potential to invade areas outside of Asia. More genetic information of B. tsuneonis should be obtained in order to develop effective methodologies for rapid and accurate molecular identification due to the difficulty of distinguishing it from Bactrocera minax based on morphological features. We report here the whole mitochondrial genome of B. tsuneonis sequenced by next-generation sequencing. This mitogenome sequence had a total length of 15,865 bp , a typical circular molecule comprising 13 protein-coding genes , 2 rRNA genes , 22 tRNA genes and a non-coding region ( A + T-rich control region). The structure and organization of the molecule were typical and similar compared with the published homologous sequences of other fruit flies in Tephritidae. The phylogenetic analyses based on the mitochondrial genome data presented a close genetic relationship between B. tsuneonis and B. minax. This is the first report of the complete mitochondrial genome of B. tsuneonis , and it can be used in further studies of species diagnosis , evolutionary biology , prevention and control.
