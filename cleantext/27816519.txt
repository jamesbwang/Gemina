  We have recently shown that the tocotrienol-rich fraction ( TRF) of palm oil , a mixture of vitamin E analogs , improves amyloid pathology in vitro and in vivo. However , precise mechanisms remain unknown. In this study , we examined the effects of long-term ( 10 months) TRF treatment on behavioral impairments and brain metabolites in ( 15 months old) AβPP/PS1 double transgenic ( Tg) Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) mice. The open field test , Morris water maze , and novel object recognition tasks revealed improved exploratory activity , spatial learning , and recognition memory , respectively , in TRF-treated Tg mice. Brain metabolite profiling of wild-type and Tg mice treated with and without TRF was performed using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography ( UHPLC) coupled to high-resolution accurate mass ( HRAM)- orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry ( MS/MS). Metabolic pathway analysis found perturbed metabolic pathways that linked to AD. TRF treatment partly ameliorated metabolic perturbations in Tg mouse hippocampus. The mechanism of this pre-emptive activity may occur via modulation of metabolic pathways dependent on Aβ interaction or independent of Aβ interaction.
