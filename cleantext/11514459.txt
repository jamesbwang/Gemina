  Despite the great contributions of utilizing heterosis to crop productivity worldwide , the molecular mechanism of heterosis remains largely unexplored. Thus , the present research is focused on the grain number heterosis of a widely used late-cropping indica<pathogen> super hybrid rice combination in China using a high-throughput next-generation RNA-seq strategy. Here , we obtained 872 million clean reads , and at least one read could maps 27,917 transcripts out of 35,679 annotations. Transcript differential expression analysis revealed a total of 5910 differentially expressed genes ( DG Through young panicle development transcriptome analysis , we conclude that the over-dominant effect is probably the major contributor to the grain number heterosis of WFYT025. The DG
