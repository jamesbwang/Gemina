  Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI) has become an established treatment option for aortic valve stenosis in patients with a high risk for conventional surgical valve replacement. A well-known complication is the development of conduction abnormalities. In the case of a new third-degree atrioventricular block , the complication can be life-threatening and permanent pacing is needed. Often these patients have a venous sheath placed in the jugular vein for the perioperative period. We report a case of inadvertent dislodgement of a permanent pacemaker lead after removal of a preoperatively placed venous sheath in a TAVI patient.
