  Primary biodiversity data represent the fundamental elements of any study in systematics and evolution. They are , however , no longer gathered as they used to be and the mass-production of observation-based occurrences is overthrowing the collection of specimen-based occurrences. Although this change in practice is a major upheaval with significant consequences in the study of biodiversity , it remains understudied and has not attracted yet the attention it deserves. Analyzing 536 million occurrences from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ( GBIF) mediated data , we show that this spectacular change affects the 24 eukaryote taxonomic classes we targeted: from 1970 to 2016 the proportion of occurrences marked as traceable to tangible material ( i.e. specimen-based occurrences) fell from 68 to 18 %; moreover , most of those specimen based-occurrences can not be readily traced back to a specimen because the necessary information is missing. Ethical , practical or legal reasons responsible for this shift are known , and this situation appears unlikely to be reversed. Still , we urge scholars to acknowledge this dramatic change , embrace it and actively deal with it. Specifically , we emphasize why specimen-based occurrences must be gathered , as a warrant to allow both repeating evolutionary studies and conducting rich and diverse investigations. When impossible to secure , voucher specimens must be replaced with observation-based occurrences combined with ancillary data ( e.g. pictures , recordings , samples , DNA sequences). Ancillary data are instrumental for the usefulness of biodiversity occurrences and we show that , despite improving technologies to collate them , they remain rarely shared. The consequences of such a change are not yet clear but we advocate collecting material evidence or ancillary data to ensure that primary biodiversity data collected lately do not partly become obsolete when doubtful.
