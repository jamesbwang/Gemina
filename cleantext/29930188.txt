  This case series is about four different foreign bodies lodged in different locations of the aerodigestive tract. All four cases had delayed diagnosis due to inconspicuous history. Radiology in the form of computed tomography aided the appropriate diagnosis in most of these cases. Though all four patients have been successfully managed by removal of foreign body , not all of them have identical outcomes. A brief discussion about predictive factors in the fish bone foreign body has been included. The authors also discuss certain critical aspects of the management , which may aid in reducing the morbidity. We emphasise on the high index of suspicion in peculiar cases and on the low threshold for radiological investigation in doubtful clinical scenarios.
