  Chagas disease , a vector-borne parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi , represents a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the Americas. Mammalian reservoir species play a large role in propagating the sylvatic transmission cycle of this disease , and this cycle can spill over , resulting in human<disease> infections<disease>. Our understanding of the wildlife species implicated in propagating this transmission cycle is incomplete. We investigated white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus) as a potential novel reservoir for this parasite. Only one of the 314 hunter-harvested deer hearts collected across Texas , was PCR-positive ( 0.3 %) for T. cruzi. This finding has potential implications for deer hunters , because it indicates that there might be a risk of blood-borne transmission during the field-dressing process. Hunters should be strongly encouraged to wear gloves and other personal protective equipment when handling carcasses to prevent exposure to infected blood.
