  We aimed to evaluate effect of heart rate ( HR) reduction on left ventricular reverse remodeling ( LVRR) in Korean patients with heart<symptom> failure<symptom> with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF). Ambulatory patients with HFrEF , who had paired echocardiograms , N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP) , and global assessment score ( GAS) at baseline and 6-month ( n = 157) , were followed up on preset treatment schedule with bisoprolol. The LVRR occurred in 49 patients ( 32 %) at 6-month. In multivariable analysis , independent predictors associated with LVRR were use of anti-aldosterone agent ( odds ratio ( OR) , 4.18; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 1.80-9.71) , young age ( OR , 0.96; 95 % CI , 0.92-0.99) , high baseline HR ( OR , 3.76; 95 % CI , 1.40-10.10) , and favorable baseline GAS ( OR , 1.73; 95 % CI , 1.06-2.81). Beneficial effect of bisoprolol , in terms of LVRR , NT-proBNP , and GAS , was remarkable in the high HR group ( baseline HR ≥ 75 beats per minute ( bpm)) , which showed a large HR reduction. High baseline HR ( ≥ 75 bpm) showed an association with LVRR and improvement of NT-proBNP and GAS in patients with HFrEF. This seems to be due to a large HR reduction after treatments with bisoprolol. Trial registry at www.ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT00749034.
