  Background/aim: Galanin is a neuropeptide that is shown to be involved in the regulation of food intake and glucose homeostasis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation of serum galanin levels with anthropometric and metabolic parameters in obese and healthy children. Material and methods: The cross-sectional study consisted of 38 obese children ( mean age: 11.9 ± 3.0 years) and 30 healthy children ( mean age: 11.4 ± 2.0 years). Clinical and biochemical parameters ( glucose , insulin , homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR) , lipids , galanin , and leptin levels) were assessed. Results: Serum galanin and leptin levels were significantly higher in obese children. In obese children , galanin levels were positively correlated with fasting glucose ( r = 0.398 , p = 0.013) , insulin ( r = 0.383 , p = 0.018) , HOMA-IR ( r = 0.375 , p = 0.020) , and triglycerides ( r = 0.391 , p = 0.015). Multivariate backward regression analysis revealed that galanin levels were significantly associated with fasting glucose , insulin , HOMA-IR , and triglyceride , which explained 42.0 % of the variance ( r2 = 0.483 , P < 0.001). Conclusions: Serum galanin levels were significantly higher in obese children than healthy controls and positively correlated with insulin resistance and triglycerides in obese children. This study suggests that galanin is associated with glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism in childhood obesity.
