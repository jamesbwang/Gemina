  We examine how stochastic time-delayed negative feedback affects the dynamical behavior of a model oscillatory reaction. We apply constant and stochastic time-delayed negative feedbacks to a point Field-Körös-Noyes photosensitive oscillator and compare their effects. Negative feedback is applied in the form of simulated inhibitory electromagnetic radiation with an intensity proportional to the concentration of oxidized light-sensitive catalyst in the oscillator. We first characterize the system under nondelayed inhibitory feedback; then we explore and compare the effects of constant ( deterministic) versus stochastic time-delayed feedback. We find that the oscillatory amplitude , frequency , and waveform are essentially preserved when low-dispersion stochastic delayed feedback is used , whereas small but measurable changes appear when a large dispersion is applied.
