  Toads of the genus Melanophryniscus contain toxic alkaloids sequestered from a diet of mainly ants and mites. Wild-caught specimens of M. klappenbachi were fed an alkaloid-free diet and their alkaloid profile was analyzed during 38 months in captivity. Individual alkaloid patterns varied considerably. Over time , the concentration of two alkaloids , pumiliotoxin 251D and 3,5-disubstituted indolizidine 195B , significantly declined , suggesting that the toads depend on continuous access to alkaloid-containing prey to maintain natural levels of their chemical defense.
