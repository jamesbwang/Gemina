  Phytochemical investigation of Croton crassifolius roots afforded five sesquiterpenes ( 1-5) , including two new sesquiterpenes 6S-hydroxy-cyperenoic acid ( 1) and crassifterpenoid A ( 5) , together with three known compounds ( 2-4). The structures of the new compounds were determined by comprehensive spectroscopic methods , and their absolute configurations were determined by quantum chemical ECD calculation. Crassifterpenoid A ( 5) is the first germacrane-type sesquiterpene isolated from C. crassifolius , which enriched the diversity of chemical constituents in Croton crassifolius. In addition , the cytotoxicities of all compounds against human liver cancer lines HepG2 and Hep3B were determined , but none showed significant activity.
