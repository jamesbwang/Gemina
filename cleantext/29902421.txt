  In this study , we fabricated a sensitive and label-free impedimetric immunosensor based on 6-phosphonohexanoic acid ( PHA) modified ITO electrode for detection of interleukin-8 ( IL-8) in human serum and saliva. PHA was first employed to cancer biomarker sensing platform. Anti-IL-8 antibody was used as a biorecognition element and the detection principle of this immunosensor was based on monitoring specific interaction between anti-IL-8 antibody and IL-8 antigen. The morphological characterization of each electrode modification step was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , SEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( EDX) and atomic force microscopy ( AFM) while electrochemical characterization was performed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS) , cyclic voltammetry ( CV) and single frequency impedance ( SFI) techniques. Moreover , the antibody immobilization on the electrode surface was proved Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR) and Raman Spectroscopy. This proposed impedimetric immunosensor exhibited good performances with a wide linear in the range from 0.02 pg/mL to 3 pg/mL as well as a relative low detection limit of 6 fg/mL. The impedimetric immunosensor had a good specificity , stability and reproducibility. This study proved that PHA was a suitable interface material to fabricate an electrochemical biosensor.
