  Although the potential for the utilization of electronic perfusion data ( EPD) from proprietary software to facilitate the understanding and improvement of cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB) has been recognized , the generalizability of previous reports of EPD integration are limited by superceded software or lack of sufficient detail for reproducibility. To date , the Australian and New Zealand Collaborative Perfusion Registry ( ANZCPR) is the only multicentre perfusion registry to have reported the integration of EPD. The inclusion of EPD in analyses of the impact of CPB on patient outcome is important in improving the understanding of CPB practice. Perfusion registries play an important role in this process , and the incorporation of EPD into perfusion registries could make a significant contribution toward this objective. By sharing the methodology used to integrate EPD from the CONNECT â„¢ software into the ANZCPR , our intent is to diminish some of the barriers to adoption of EPD integration into other perfusion registries , by providing an example of how EPD integration may be achieved.
