  We developed a psychosocial dementia care program to help care managers and professional caregivers manage challenging behavior in home-dwelling persons with dementia in Japan. The program consists of a web-based tool for ongoing monitoring and assessment for challenging behavior , and multi-agency discussion meetings. Results of a cluster-randomized controlled trial indicate a reduction in challenging behavior through this program. The present study aimed to identify a key component of the developed program that is associated with a reduction in challenging behavior. We used consecutive data of the intervention and examined the association between challenging behavior in home-dwelling persons with dementia , professionals ' competence , and the frequency of revision of action plans. Challenging behavior was assessed using the total score of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. A baseline and follow-up questionnaire was completed by care professionals using a Japanese version of the Sense of Competence in Dementia Care Staff scale. A total of 86 care professionals completed a 6-month intervention with 219 persons with dementia. The 86 care professionals significantly improved in their dementia care competence. Challenging behavior was significantly reduced among the 219 persons with dementia at follow-up regardless of the level of professionals ' competence or the frequency of revision of action plans. Less pain was significantly related to the lower levels of challenging behavior. The ongoing multi-agency discussion meetings , with a focus on challenging behavior , may have been the key component in the psychosocial dementia care program. Pain management should be emphasized in action plans for challenging behavior.
