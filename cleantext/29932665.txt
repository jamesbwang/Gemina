  Conversion of solar energy into liquid fuel often relies on multielectron redox processes that include highly reactive intermediates , with back reaction routes that hinder the overall efficiency of the process. Here , we reveal that these undesirable reaction pathways can be minimized , rendering the photocatalytic reactions more efficient , when charge carriers are harvested from a multiexcitonic state of a semiconductor photocatalyst. A plasmonic antenna , comprising Au nanoprisms , was employed to accomplish feasible levels of multiple carrier excitations in semiconductor nanocrystal-based photocatalytic systems ( CdSe@CdS core-shell quantum dots and CdSe@CdS seeded nanorods). The antenna 's near-field amplifies the otherwise inherently weak biexciton generation in the semiconductor. The two-electron photoreduction of Pt and Pd metal precursors served as model reactions. In the presence of the plasmonic antenna , these photocatalyzed two-electron reactions exhibited enhanced yields and kinetics. This work uniquely relies on a nonlinear enhancement that has potential for large amplification of photocatalytic activity in the presence of a plasmonic near-field.
