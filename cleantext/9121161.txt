  Low amounts of human pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment can affect bacteria , animals and ultimately humans. Here , the environmental consequences of a shift in prescription behavior from prednisolone to berberine was modeled using an environmental decision support system based on four consecutive steps: emission , fate , exposure and effect. This model estimates the relative aquatic and human health impacts of alternative pharmaceutical prescriptions throughout Europe. Since a Defined Daily Dose ( DDD) of berberine has yet to be formulated , the environmental impacts of berberine and prednisolone were compared under the assumption of equal DDDs. Subsequently , the relative impact ratio indicates the extent to which the actual DDD of berberine might be higher to still be environmentally preferable over prednisolone. In fact , berberine can be administered at a six times higher dose throughout Europe before its impact on the aquatic environment exceeds that of one prescription of prednisolone. On average , the results for impacts on human health are similar , with the median impact ratio ranging between 5.87 and 22.8 depending on the level of drinking water purification. However , for some regions in Spain , Austria , Baltic States and Finland , berberine can only be considered an environmentally better alternative if it is administered at a lower dose than prednisolone. We conclude that for most regions in Europe it is , up until a certain dose of berberine , beneficial for the aquatic environment and therefore human health to prefer prescription of berberine over prednisolone.
