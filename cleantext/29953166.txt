  An easily prepared iron ( ii) amide precatalyst enables the selective hydroboration of carbonyls with HBpin ( pinacolborane) in the absence of any additive. The reactions proceed with low catalytic loading ( 1-3 mol %) under mild reaction conditions and display wide functional group compatibility. Aldehydes are selectively hydroborated in the presence of other reducible functional groups , such as ketones , alkenes , nitriles , esters , amides , acids and halides.
