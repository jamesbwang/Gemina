  Penetrating laceration injury in the pediatric population may present as an acute or delayed life-threatening injury. Although emergent intra-arterial embolization is commonly utilized in adults , few cases have been reported for children. Surgical treatment for severe renal laceration injuries may require complete nephrectomy; an unfortunate outcome for a pediatric patient if a renal-preserving alternative is feasible. We present a case of penetrating renal laceration in a 10-year-old boy treated with intra-arterial embolization of the lacerated dominant renal artery and subsequent renal perfusion by an uninjured accessory renal artery allowing for renal preservation.
