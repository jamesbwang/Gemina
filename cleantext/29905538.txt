  The study was conducted with the aim to improve the results of treatment of patients with inguinal hernia by the mode of glue fixation of mesh implant in laparoscopic hernioplasty. Laparoscopic hernioplasty was performed on 96 patients at the N.D. Monastyrsky Department of Surgery of North-Western State Medical University named after I.I. Mechnikov , on the base of L.G. Sokolov Clinical Hospital № 122 , in the period from 2014 to 2016. The patients were divided into three groups: I group- 36 patients , who underwent laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair ( TAPP) without supplying of mesh implant under spermatic cord and its fixation with cyanoacrylate glue `` B-Braun '' with elimination of peritoneum defect above the implant with a thread V-loc; II group consisted of 34 patients , treated with laparoscopic TAPP without cutting of mesh implant and its fixation along the periphery with titanium staples with the subsequent closing of peritoneum defect with titanium staples. Group III included 26 patients who underwent total extraperitonеal laparoscopic hernioplasty without fixation of mesh implant. All patients were males. Complex analysis of the duration of surgical procedure , patients ' quality of life , number of complications and level of abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> in incipient post-operative period was carried out. Laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair in combination with use of glue composition for fixation of mesh implant improves the quality of life of a patient during post-operative period , contributes to early discharge from the hospital and quicker recovery for resuming job activities.
