  This study involved 503 cattle with traumatic reticuloperitonitis ( TRP) , 494 of which underwent ultrasonographic and 484 radiographic examination of the reticulum. Ultrasonography revealed changes in the reticulum and/or peritoneum suggestive of peritonitis<disease> in 403 ( 83 %) cattle , a decrease in the amplitude of reticular contractions in 244 ( 54 %) and reduced or absent reticular motility in 173 ( 37 %). A total of 536 foreign bodies were seen on 465 ( 96 %) radiographs and a magnet was seen on 311 ( 64 %) radiographs. Of the 536 foreign bodies , 300 ( 56 %) were not attached to a magnet and 236 ( 44 %) were attached. Of 300 radiographs showing foreign bodies not attached to a magnet , the foreign body was lying flat on the floor of the reticulum on 98 ( 18 %) radiographs , was at an angle of greater than 30 degrees to the ventral aspect of the reticulum on 54 ( 10 %) , had penetrated the dorsal reticular wall on 76 ( 14 %) , had perforated the reticulum on 64 ( 12 %) and was completely outside of the reticulum on 8 ( 1 %) radiographs. Ultrasonography provides information about the scale and localisation of inflammatory changes of the peritoneum , and radiography allows the visualisation of ferromagnetic foreign bodies and magnets.
