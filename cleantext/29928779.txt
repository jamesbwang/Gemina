  Incorporation of QTc in clinical decision support systems requires accurate QT-interval correction , also during common electrocardiogram abnormalities as ventricular conduction defects ( VCD). We compared the performance and predictive value of QT correction formulas to design a patient-specific QT correction algorithm ( QTcA). The first ECG in adult patients with sinus rhythm ( SR) , atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) , and ventricular pacing ( VP) was collected retrospectively. QT correction was performed with Bazett ( QTcB) , Fridericia ( QTcFri) , Framingham , Hodges , and Rautaharju ( QTcR) formulas. Correction formulas were compared using QTc/RR linear regression. Adjusted Cox regression was performed to predict 1-year all-cause mortality. A total of 49,737 patients were included ( 70.0 % SR , 24.1 % AF , 5.9 % VP , 11.1 % VCD). Overall 1-year all-cause mortality rate was 11.8 %. In patients without VCD or VP , QTcFri showed significantly better heart rate correction , both overall ( P < 0.001) and in subgroups by heart rate ( bradycardia<symptom> P ≤ 0.001 , normal P ≤ 0.050 , tachycardia<symptom> P ≤ 0.010). Furthermore , QTcFri improved mortality prediction significantly when compared to QTcB ( P < 0.001). Patients with VCD or VP QTcR , including correction for QRS duration , had a significant better heart rate correction than QTcB ( P ≤ 0.010) and improved mortality prediction significantly compared to all other formulas ( P < 0.001). Implementing QTcA , designed based on QTcFri and QTcR depending on the presence of VCD or VP , reduced the patients considered to be at risk by 61.1 % when compared to QTcB. A patient-specific QT correction algorithm would combine accurate heart rate correction , improved predictive value of mortality , and a reduction of patients considered to be at risk.
