  Intellectual property law has been interacting with software for over sixty years. Despite this , the law in this area remains confused and uncertain: this is particularly evident in patent law. Focusing on U.S. patent law from the 1960s through to the mid-1970s , this article argues that a key reason for this confusion<symptom> relates to the particular way that the subject matter was construed. While the early discussions about subject matter eligibility were framed in terms of the question `` is software patentable? '' , what was really at stake in these debates was the preliminary ontological question: what is software? Building on work that highlights the competing ways that software was construed by different parts of the information technology industry at the time , the article looks at the particular way that the law responded to these competing interpretations and how in so doing it laid the foundation for the confusion<symptom> that characterizes the area. When engaging with new types of subject matter , patent law has consistently relied on the relevant techno-scientific communities not only to provide the law with a relatively clear understanding of the nature of the subject matter being considered; they have also provided the means to allow the law to describe , demarcate , and identify that new subject matter. The inherently divided nature of the nascent information technology industry meant that this was not possible. As a result , the law was forced to develop its own way of dealing with the would-be subject matter.
