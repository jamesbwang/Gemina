  Antisense oligonucleotide ( AON)- mediated exon skipping is an emerging therapeutic for individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD). Skipping of exons adjacent to common exon deletions in DMD using AONs can produce in-frame transcripts and functional protein. Targeted skipping of DMD exons 8 , 44 , 45 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , and 55 is predicted to benefit 47 % of affected individuals. We observed a correlation between mutation subgroups and age at loss of ambulation in the Duchenne Registry , a large database of phenotypic and genetic data for DMD ( N = 765). Males amenable to exon 44 ( N = 74) and exon 8 skipping ( N = 18) showed prolonged ambulation compared to other exon skip groups and nonsense mutations ( P = 0.035 and P < 0.01 , respectively). In particular , exon 45 deletions were associated with prolonged age at loss of ambulation relative to the rest of the exon 44 skip amenable cohort and other DMD mutations. Exon 3-7 deletions also showed prolonged ambulation relative to all other exon 8 skippable mutations. Cultured myotubes from DMD patients with deletions of exons 3-7 or exon 45 showed higher endogenous skipping than other mutations , providing a potential biological rationale for our observations. These results highlight the utility of aggregating phenotypic and genotypic data for rare pediatric diseases to reveal progression differences , identify potentially confounding factors , and probe molecular mechanisms that may affect disease severity.
