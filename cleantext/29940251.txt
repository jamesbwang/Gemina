  Transperineal prostate mapping ( TTPM) biopsy is an increasingly utilized method of procuring tissue from men with suspected prostate cancer. We sought to report the patient related outcome measures ( PROMs) and adverse events in men undergoing this diagnostic test within the PICTURE trial. 249 men underwent a mpMRI followed by a TTPM biopsy as a validation study. Pre-and post-TTPM functional outcomes were prospectively collected and recorded using IPSS , IPSS-QoL , IIEF-15 and EPIC-Urinary function questionnaires. Mean age , median PSA and median gland size was 62 years , 6.8 ng/ml and 37 ml , respectively. At TTPM biopsy , a median ( IQR) 49 ( 40-55) cores were taken. Mean time for completion of post-procedure PROMs questionnaires was 46 days. Adverse events included post procedure acute urinary<symptom> retention<symptom> ( 24 %) , rectal<symptom> pain<symptom> ( 26 %) and perineal pain ( 41 %). TTPM-biopsy resulted in a statistically significant increase in IPSS ( 10.9 to 11.8; p = 0.024) and IPSS-QoL score ( 1.57 to 1.76; p = 0.03). The erectile function score on IIEF-15 declined by 23.2 % ( 47.7 to 38.7; p < 0.001). Significant deterioration in all 5 functional domains of IIEF-15 ( erectile and orgasmic function , sexual desire , intercourse and overall satisfaction; p < 0.001) occurred. EPIC-Urinary scores showed no overall change from baseline. TTPM-biopsy causes a high urinary<symptom> retention<symptom> rate and a detrimental impact on genitourinary functional outcomes including deterioration in urinary flow and sexual function. Our findings can be used to ensure adequate counselling about TTPM-biopsies and point to a need for strategies such as mpMRI and targeted biopsies to minimize harms of TTPM-biopsy.
