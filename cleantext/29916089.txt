  Sarcopenia reduces physical ability and cardiorespiratory fitness ( CRF) , leading to poor quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and CRF in elderly men. We assessed 102 community-dwelling men over 60 years old. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass ( ASM) was determined using bioelectrical impedance analysis , and the skeletal muscle mass index ( SMI) was calculated as ASM divided by the square of height. Subjects with an SMI less than 7.0 kg/m Of the 102 subjects , 15 ( 14.7 %) were included in the sarcopenic group. There were significant correlations between SMI and peak oxygen consumption ( VO This study demonstrated that skeletal muscle mass might be closely associated with CRF. Therefore , sarcopenia should be appropriately managed to improve an individual 's CRF.
