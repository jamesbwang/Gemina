  Feasibility study to evaluate efficacy and safety of Adjustable Transobturator Male System ( ATOMS Twenty patients were implanted ATOMS Median age was 76.5 years. Five patients received previous pelvic radiation ( 3 prostate , 2 rectal cancer) and 2 ( 10 %) previous failed artificial urinary sphincter with urethral erosion and mechanical failure , respectively. Preoperative SUI was mild in 4 ( 20 %) , moderate in 7 ( 35 %) and severe in 9 ( 45 %). Median filling of the system was 13.5 ml. Median pad-test decreased from 375 ± 855 ml baseline to 10 ± 31.5 ml and pad-count from 4 ± 3 to 0 ± 1.5 after adjustment ( 1 ± 3fillings). Postoperative SUI distribution was mild in 2 ( 10 %) , moderate in one ( 5 %) and severe in 2 ( 10 %). Satisfaction rate was 80 % , equal for transurethral resection of the prostate with/without previous radiotherapy. No patient had urinary<symptom> retention<symptom> after catheter removal. Complications presented in 3 ( 15 %) patients , all minor. After median 38.5 mo follow-up no system has been removed , 19 ( 95 %) self-considered better than before and 11 ( 55 %) very much better. Based on short-term efficacy and patient satisfaction ATOMS
