  Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk for pulmonary morbidity and mortality. International guidelines recommend pulmonary function tests ( PFT) during follow-up care. This nationwide study assessed how many children received PFT within 5 years after pulmotoxic treatment in Switzerland , types of tests , and predictors for testing. We included all children from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry who were diagnosed with cancer from 1990 to 2013 at age 0-16 years , survived for â‰¥ 2 years from diagnosis , and had pulmotoxic chemotherapy with bleomycin , busulfan , nitrosoureas , and/or chest radiotherapy. We searched medical records in all Swiss pediatric oncology clinics for PFT ( spirometry , plethysmography , diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide ( DLCO)) and treatment details. We found medical records for 372 children , of whom 147 had pulmotoxic chemotherapy and 323 chest radiotherapy. Only 185 had plethysmography and/or spirometry ( 50 %) , 122 had DLCO ( 33 %). Testing varied by cancer center from 3 % to 79 % ( P = 0.001). Central nervous system tumor survivors and those not treated according to study protocols had less plethysmography and/or spirometry ( odds ratio ( OR) 0.3 and 0.3) , lymphoma survivors and those who were symptomatic had more PFT ( plethysmography and/or spirometry: OR 5.9 and 8.7; DLCO: OR 3.4 and 2.3). Cumulative incidence ( CuI) of PFT was 52 % in the first 5 years after pulmotoxic treatment; most of the tests were done in the first 2 years after treatment ( CuI 44 %). Only half of the survivors exposed to pulmotoxic treatment have been followed up with PFT in Switzerland. We need to optimize , update , and implement monitoring guidelines.
