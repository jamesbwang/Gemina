  Electroencephalography ( EEG) signals recorded during simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) are contaminated by strong artifacts. Among these , the ballistocardiographic ( BCG) artifact is the most challenging , due to its complex spatio-temporal dynamics associated with ongoing cardiac activity. The presence of BCG residuals in EEG data may hide true , or generate spurious correlations between EEG and fMRI time-courses. Here , we propose an adaptive Optimal Basis Set ( aOBS) method for BCG artifact removal. Our method is adaptive , as it can estimate the delay between cardiac activity and BCG occurrence on a beat-to-beat basis. The effective creation of an optimal basis set by principal component analysis ( PCA) is therefore ensured by a more accurate alignment of BCG occurrences. Furthermore , aOBS can automatically estimate which components produced by PCA are likely to be BCG artifact-related and therefore need to be removed. The aOBS performance was evaluated on high-density EEG data acquired with simultaneous fMRI in healthy subjects during visual stimulation. As aOBS enables effective reduction of BCG residuals while preserving brain signals , we suggest it may find wide application in simultaneous EEG-fMRI studies.
