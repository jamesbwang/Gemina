  The classical baculovirus display system ( BDS) has often recruited fields including gene delivery , gene therapy , and the genetic engineering of vaccines , as it is capable of presenting foreign polypeptides on the membranes<symptom> of recombinant baculovirus through a transmembrane protein. However , classical BDS 's high cost , complicated operation , low display efficiency and its inability to simultaneously display multiple gene products impede its practicality. In this study , we present a novel and highly efficient display system based on ires-dependent gp64 for rescuing gp64-null Bacmid of baculovirus construction without affecting the viral replication cycle , which we name the baculovirus multigene display system ( BMDS). Laser scanning confocal microscopy demonstrated that eGFP , eYFP , and mCherry were translocated on the membrane of Spodoptera frugiperda 9 cell successfully as expected. Western blot analysis further confirmed the presence of the fluorescent proteins on the budded , mature viral particles. The results showed the display efficiency of target gene on cell surface is fourfold that of classical BDS. In addition , a recombinant baculovirus displaying three kinds of fluorescent proteins simultaneously was constructed , thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of BMDS as a co-display system.
