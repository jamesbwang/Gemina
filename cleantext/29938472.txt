  Background: The fourth most prevalent cancer worldwide and a major cause of death in developing countries is gastric cancer ( GC). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2) , is a proto-oncogene expressed in different solid tumors. This study aimed to evaluate possible associations of HER2 expression status with survival rate , age , sex , tumor grade , histopathological type , and primary tumor location in patients with GC. Methods: Subjects were enrolled in this cohort study after consideration of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Biopsy specimens were stained using immunohistochemistry. Samples with a score of 3 + were considered to exhibit HER2 overexpression. The mentioned variables were extracted from patients ' files as well as by clinical evaluation. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied for analyzing the survival rate and Chi square for possible factor associations. Results: A total of 210 patients ( 25.2 % female and 74.8 % male) were enrolled. In a 5-year follow-up ( adherence rate: 45.7 %) , the average survival was 9.4 ± 10.9 months. HER2 overexpression was evident in 24 %. There was no statistically significant association found between HER2 expression and primary tumor location ( p-value = 0.63) , histopathological type ( p-value = 0.72) , or tumor grade ( p-value = 0.051). Furthermore , no statistically significant links were apparent with tumor grade in either male or female groups as well as patients aged ≥ 60 and ˂60 years ( all p-values > 0.05). Moreover , no statistically significant association was detected between HER2 expression status ( p-value = 0.88) , sex ( p-value = 0.31) , and age ( p-value = 0.055) with patient survival. Conclusions: No statistically meaningful association was found between all parameters examined and HER2 expression status. Divergence of the results from earlier studies might be due to genetic variation. Thus , performing a meta-analysis on certain races might be helpful for clarification.
