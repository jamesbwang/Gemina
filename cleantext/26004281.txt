  Various randomized-controlled clinical trials ( RCTs) have investigated the neuroprotective role of minocycline in acute ischemic stroke ( AIS) or acute intracerebral hemorrhage<symptom> ( ICH) patients. We sought to consolidate and investigate the efficacy and safety of minocycline in patients with acute stroke. Literature search spanned through November 30 , 2017 across major databases to identify all RCTs that reported following efficacy outcomes among acute stroke patients treated with minocycline vs. placebo: National Institute of Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS) , Barthel Index ( BI) , and modified Rankin Scale ( mRS) scores. Additional safety , neuroimaging and biochemical endpoints were extracted. We pooled mean differences ( MD) and risk ratios ( RR) from RCTs using random-effects models. We identified 7 RCTs comprising a total of 426 patients. Of these , additional unpublished data was obtained on contacting corresponding authors of 5 RCTs. In pooled analysis , minocycline demonstrated a favorable trend towards 3-month functional independence ( mRS-scores of 0-2) ( RR = 1.31; 95 % CI 0.98-1.74 , p = 0.06) and 3-month BI ( MD = 6.92; 95 % CI- 0.92 , 14.75; p = 0.08). In AIS subgroup , minocycline was associated with higher rates of 3-month mRS-scores of 0-2 ( RR = 1.59; 95 % CI 1.19-2.12 , p = 0.002; I Although data is limited , minocycline demonstrated efficacy and seems a promising neuroprotective agent in acute stroke patients , especially in AIS subgroup. Further RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of minocycline among ICH patients.
