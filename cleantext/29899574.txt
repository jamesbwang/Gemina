  To gauge the risk of delaying initiation of prophylaxis with letermovir from the time of donor infusion to prevent CMV infection in allo-HSCT recipients we investigated the clinical outcomes of CMV DNAemia episodes occurring before engraftment , and compared to that of episodes developing after engraftment ( up to day +365). A total of 197 consecutive adult patients were included. Plasma CMV DNA load was monitored by real-time PCR assays ( limit of detection: 31 IU/ml). A total of 150 out of 197 patients had CMV DNAemia ( cumulative incidence of 77 %; 95 % CI , 73-81 %) , and 38 out of the 197 patients developed it before engraftment ( cumulative incidence , 19 %; 95 % CI , 10-30.3 %). Nine episodes of CMV DNAemia were detected prior to the time of donor progenitor cell infusion. A greater number of post-engraftment episodes required preemptive antiviral therapy compared with pre-engraftment episodes ( 62.5 % vs 44.7 %; P = 0.05). The cellular content of the donor progenitor cell infusion and transplant characteristics of patients did not differ between patients with pre-engraftment or post-engraftment CMV DNAemia. The cumulative incidence of overall mortality by days 100 and 365 , aGvHD by day 100 and relapse by day 365 were not significantly different between patients with pre-engraftment or post-engraftment CMV DNAemia.
