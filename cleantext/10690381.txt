  The accurate evaluation of the therapeutic effects of advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( LHSCC) remains challenging. In this study , we determined the value of quantitative parameters derived from dual-energy computed tomography ( DECT) for predicting the therapeutic effects of advanced LHSCC and to provide valuable evidence for early judgement of the tumour 's response to therapy in clinical practice. We prospectively analysed 41 patients with pathologically confirmed LHSCC. All patients received a DECT scan before therapy. Nineteen of 41 patients showed complete remission ( CR) , and 22 showed non-complete remission ( NCR). The mean of the slope of spectral Hounsfield unit curve ( Î»
