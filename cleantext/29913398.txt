  In this work , zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 ( ZIF-8) was successfully synthesized by a facile reaction via water and alcohol solvents at room temperature. Additionally , Ag/AgCl @ZIF -8 was successfully fabricated by doping Ag/AgCl onto ZIF-8 , which were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , field emission scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , energy dispersive spectrometry ( EDS) , along with UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra ( UV-vis DRS). The Ag/AgCl @ZIF -8 nanoparticles exhibited high photocatalytic activity , durability , and efficiency for the degradation of methylene blue dye ( MB). The results illustrate that the band gap of Ag/AgCl @ZIF -8 is lower than that of ZIF-8 , which explains the enhancement of MB degradation under UV light irradiation. The conditions affecting the photocatalytic degradation , including the dosage of photocatalyst , the initial concentration of MB , pH value , and hardness of water were systematically evaluated. In addition , the photocatalytic mechanism was explored by three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix ( 3D-EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy , the effect of ZnO to photocatalytic activity was excluded , and a possible pathway of MB degradation was proposed by analysis of intermediates via liquid chromatography in combination with hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( LC-QTOF-MS). The high photocatalytic ability of Ag/AgCl @ZIF -8 shows great application potential for the oxidation of organic pollutants in water.
