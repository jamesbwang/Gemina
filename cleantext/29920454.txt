  Symmetrical and unsymmetrical bis-aryl-α , β-unsaturated ketones were synthesized in moderate to excellent yield by treating cyclohexanone with various aldehydes. Dimethylammonium dimethylcarbamate ( DIMCARB) was used as both catalyst and reaction medium for the synthesis of monoarylidenes cycloadduct intermediates , which was further used to produce diarylidene cyclohexanones. All the 34 compounds synthesized were evaluated for their anti-proliferative activity , particularly against promastigote of Leishmania<pathogen> amazonensis , epimastigoteand trypomastigoteof Trypanosoma cruzi. Eighteen compounds displayed anti-leishmanial activity against promastigotes of L. amazonensis with IC
