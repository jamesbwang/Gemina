  MAPK signaling pathways are constitutively active in colon cancer and also promote acquired resistance to MEK1 inhibition. Here we demonstrate that BRAFV600E-mutated colorectal cancers acquire resistance to MEK1 inhibition by inducing expression of the scaffold protein CEMIP through a beta-catenin- and FRA-1-dependent pathway. CEMIP was found in endosomes and bound MEK1 to sustain ERK1/2 activation in MEK1 inhibitor-resistant BRAFV600E-mutated colorectal cancers. The CEMIP-dependent pathway maintained c-Myc protein levels through ERK1/2 and provided metabolic advantage in resistant cells , potentially by sustaining amino acids synthesis. CEMIP silencing circumvented resistance to MEK1 inhibition , partly , through a decrease of both ERK1/2 signaling and c-Myc. Together , our data identify a cross-talk between Wnt and MAPK signaling cascades , which involves CEMIP. Activation of this pathway promotes survival by potentially regulating levels of specific amino acids via a Myc-associated cascade. Targeting this node may provide a promising avenue for treatment of colon cancers that have acquired resistance to targeted therapies.
