  Omalizumab is approved as an add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria ( CSU) in patients with inadequate response to H1-anti-histamine treatment. The urticaria control test ( UCT) is a reliable , brief tool developed as an alternative to the 7-day urticaria activity score ( UAS7)- the standard for CSU disease activity assessment. This prospective , open-label , phase IV study evaluated the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in French adult patients with CSU nonresponsive to H1-antihistamine treatment. Patients ( N = 136; stratified 1:2 ( with angioedema: without angioedema)) received omalizumab 300 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. Study assessments included UCT , UAS7 , angioedema activity score and D-dimer levels ( exploratory objective) RESULTS: At Week 12 , 74.6 % of the patients achieved disease control ( UCT score ≥ 12 ( primary endpoint)) and 67.7 % of patients showed well-controlled disease ( UAS7 ≤ 6). There was a strong negative correlation between UCT score and UAS7 at Week 12 ( Spearman 's correlation coefficient -0.839). Mean plasma D-dimer concentration was elevated at baseline ( 1002.1 ng/mL) and decreased notably at Week 8 ( 455 ng/mL). Among the 9 patients with a very high baseline D-dimer concentration ( > 3000 ng/mL) , 8 were responders ( UAS7 ≤ 6) at Week 12. Omalizumab was efficacious in patients with CSU nonresponsive to H1-antihistamines. The UCT was a reliable tool for disease assessment and the scores correlated well with UAS7. This study does not support the usefulness of D-dimer to monitor long-term disease prognosis in adult urticaria , however , it may indicate patients who respond to omalizumab.
