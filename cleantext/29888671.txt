  In the present study the effect of capsaicin was studied on PD model flies expressing human alpha synuclein. First the potential of scavenging superoxide anion and free radicals by capsaicin at doses of 20 , 40 , 80 and 100 μM was estimated. The PD flies were allowed to feed separately on the diet containg 20 , 40 , 80 and 100 μM of capsaicin , respectively , for 24 days. After 24 days of exposure , fly head homogenate was prepared from each group and was used to estimate glutathione ( GSH) , protein carbonyl ( PC) , dopamine content , lipid peroxidation ( LPO) , glutathione-S-transferase ( GST) and monoamine oxidase ( MAO) activity. A dose dependent significant increase in the potential of scavenging superoxide anions and free radicals by capsaicin was observed for the doses of 20 , 40 , 80 and 100 μM. The exposure of capsaicin not only significantly increased the GSH ( max. by 1.37-fold) , and dopamine ( max. by 1.56-fold) content but also reduced LPO ( max. by 1.8-fold) , GST ( max. by 1.26-fold) , MAO activities ( max. by 1.60-fold) and PC content ( max. by 1.95-fold) , compared to unexposed PD flies ( p < 0.05). The results suggest the protective role of capsaicin against the PD symptoms.
