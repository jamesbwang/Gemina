  Living cells sense the mechanical properties of their surrounding environment and respond accordingly. Crawling cells detect the rigidity of their substratum and migrate in certain directions. They can be classified into two categories: slow-moving and fast-moving cell types. Slow-moving cell types , such as fibroblasts , smooth muscle cells , mesenchymal stem cells , etc. , move toward rigid areas on the substratum in response to a rigidity gradient. However , there is not much information on rigidity sensing in fast-moving cell types whose size is ∼ 10 μm and migration velocity is ∼ 10 μm/min. In this study , we used both isotropic substrata with different rigidities and an anisotropic substratum that is rigid on the x axis but soft on the y axis to demonstrate rigidity sensing by fast-moving Dictyostelium cells and neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 cells. Dictyostelium cells exerted larger traction forces on a more rigid isotropic substratum. Dictyostelium cells and HL-60 cells migrated in the `` soft '' direction on the anisotropic substratum , although myosin II-null Dictyostelium cells migrated in random directions , indicating that rigidity sensing of fast-moving cell types differs from that of slow types and is induced by a myosin II-related process.
