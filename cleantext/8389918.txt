  The envelope glycoprotein 51 ( gp51) is essential for bovine leukaemia virus ( BLV) entry to bovine B-lymphocytes. Although the bovine adaptor protein 3 complex subunit delta-1 ( boAP3D1) has been proposed as the potential receptor , the specific ligand-receptor interaction has not yet been completely defined and boAP3D1 receptor and gp51 3D structures have not been determined. This study was thus aimed at a functional annotation of boAP3D1 cellular adaptor protein and BLV gp51 and , proposing a reliable model for gp51-AP3D1 interaction using bioinformatics tools. The boAP3D1 receptor interaction patterns were calculated based on models of boAP3D1 receptor and gp51 complexes ' 3D structures , which were constructed using homology techniques and data-driven docking strategy. The results showed that the participation of 6 key amino acids ( aa) on gp51 ( Asn170 , Trp127 , His115 , Ala97 , Ser98 and Glu128) and 4 aa on AP3D1 ( Lys925 , Asp807 , Asp695 and Arg800) was highly probable in the interaction between gp51 and BLVR domains. Three gp51 recombinant peptides were expressed and purified to validate these results: the complete domain ( rgp51) , the N-terminal portion ( rNgp51) and the C-terminal fragment ( rCgp51); and binding assays to Madin-Darby bovine kidney ( MDBK) cells were then carried out with each recombinant. It was found that rNgp51 preferentially bound to MDBK cells , suggesting this domain 's functional role during invasion. The rNgp51-MDBK cell interaction was sensitive to trypsin ( 98 % reduction) and chymotrypsin treatment ( 80 % reduction). These results highlighted that the N-terminal portion of gp51 interacted in vitro with the AP3D1 receptor and provides a plausible in silico interaction model.
