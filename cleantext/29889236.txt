  In skeletal muscle , interactions between contractile and connective tissue elements at multiple scales result in emergent properties that determine mechanical performance. One of these phenomena is architectural gearing , which is quantified as the ratio of muscle velocity to muscle fiber velocity. Many pennate muscles operate with a gear ratio greater than one because muscles shorten through a combination of muscle fiber shortening and fiber rotation. Within a muscle , gearing is variable across contractions. During low force contractions , muscles operate at high gear while muscles operate at low gear during high force contractions. This variable gearing has a significant impact on muscle performance as muscle architectural changes favor muscle speed during fast contractions and muscle force during slow , high force contractions. We hypothesize that gearing in any given contraction is determined by the dynamic interaction of fiber-generated forces , fluid force transmission , and the elastic behavior of intramuscular connective tissues. Because muscle is isovolumetric , muscle fibers must bulge radially when they shorten. Radial bulging and fiber-generated forces off-axis from the muscle line of action exert forces that load connective tissues that ensheath fibers , fascicles and the whole muscle. The way in which fluid pressures and fiber forces interact to load connective tissues in three-dimensions remains poorly understood because of the complex and multiscale nature of these interactions. Here we review evidence for variable gearing in pennate muscles , present a conceptual model that describes the fundamental interactions that determine gearing , and discuss where gaps remain in our understanding of the determinants and consequences of muscle shape change and variable gearing.
