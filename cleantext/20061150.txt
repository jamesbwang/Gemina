  Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide , and its incidence is rising with numbers expected to increase 70 % in the next two decades. The fact that current mainline treatments for cancer patients are accompanied by debilitating side effects prompts a growing demand for new therapies that not only inhibit growth and proliferation of cancer cells , but also control invasion and metastasis. One class of targets gaining international attention is the aquaporins , a family of membrane-spanning water channels with diverse physiological functions and extensive tissue-specific distributions in humans. Aquaporins-1 , -2 , -3 , -4 , -5 , -8 , and-9 have been linked to roles in cancer invasion , and metastasis , but their mechanisms of action remain to be fully defined. Aquaporins are implicated in the metastatic cascade in processes of angiogenesis , cellular dissociation , migration , and invasion. Cancer invasion and metastasis are proposed to be potentiated by aquaporins in boosting tumor angiogenesis , enhancing cell volume regulation , regulating cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions , interacting with actin cytoskeleton , regulating proteases and extracellular-matrix degrading molecules , contributing to the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions , and interacting with signaling pathways enabling motility and invasion. Pharmacological modulators of aquaporin channels are being identified and tested for therapeutic potential , including compounds derived from loop diuretics , metal-containing organic compounds , plant natural products , and other small molecules. Further studies on aquaporin-dependent functions in cancer metastasis are needed to define the differential contributions of different classes of aquaporin channels to regulation of fluid balance<symptom> , cell volume , small solute transport , signal transduction , their possible relevance as rate limiting steps , and potential values as therapeutic targets for invasion and metastasis.
