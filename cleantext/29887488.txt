  Youth living with HIV<pathogen> ( YLHIV) in the United States ( U.S.) account for nearly one-third of new HIV<pathogen> infections and face significant barriers to care engagement; only 25 % are virally suppressed. Healthcare transition ( HCT) from pediatric/adolescent to adult-oriented care can be particularly disruptive. Accordingly , we prospectively examined HCT processes at 14 distinct geographical sites across the U.S.. We collected Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interviews data and abstracted electronic medical records from 135 HCT-eligible YLHIV at baseline and 9-month follow-up. Descriptive analyses and multilevel modeling were conducted. Data also included qualitative interviews with 28 adolescent and 30 adult providers across 14 adolescent and 20 adult clinics , respectively. Interviews were analyzed using the constant comparative method; this analysis focused on specific HCT recommendations. At baseline , youth were primarily age 24 ( 78.8 %) , male ( 76.8 %) , black ( 78.0 %) , identified as a sexual minority ( 62.9 %) , had attended an HIV<pathogen> appointment in the past 3 months ( 90.2 %) , had Medicaid for insurance ( 65.2 %) , and were always or mostly always adherent to their antiretroviral therapy ( 65.9 %). At the 9-month follow-up only 37 % of YLHIV successfully transitioned to adult care. Both individual-level ( insurance status and disclosure-related stigma) and clinic-level ( adolescent clinic best practices) factors were significant. Adolescent and adult clinic staff offered recommendations to support HCT; these focused primarily on clinical changes. This study highlights the complex set of individual- and clinic-level factors associated with HCT. Addressing these key factors is essential for developing streamlined , comprehensive , and context-specific HCT protocols to support continuous care engagement for YLHIV.
