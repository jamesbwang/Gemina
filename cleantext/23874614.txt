  As medical science continues to advance , health care professionals and researchers are increasingly turning to clinical trials to obtain evidence supporting best-practice treatment options. While clinical trial registries such as Clinical-Trials. gov<pathogen> aim to facilitate these needs , it has been shown that many trials in the registry do not contain links to their published results. To address this problem , we present NCT Link , a system for automatically linking registered clinical trials to published MEDLINE articles reporting their results. NCT Link incorporates state-of-the-art deep learning and information retrieval techniques by automatically learning a Deep Highway Network ( DHN) that estimates the likelihood that a MEDLINE article reports the results of a clinical trial. Our experimental results indicate that NCT Link obtains 30 % -58 % improved performance over previously reported automatic systems , suggesting that NCT Link could become a valuable tool for health care providers seeking to deliver best-practice medical care informed by evidence of clinical trials as well as ( a) researchers investigating selective publication and reporting of clinical trial outcomes , and ( b) study designers seeking to avoid unnecessary duplication of research efforts.
