  The aim of the study was to evaluate whether YKL-40 ( chitinase 3-like 1 protein) plays a role in pterygium pathogenesis. We included 42 primary pterygium patients and 24 control subjects with normal bulbar conjunctiva in the study. The pterygium patients were classified into the atrophic , fleshy , and intermediate groups according to the Tan classification. We then surgically removed the primary nasal pterygium and normal bulbar conjunctiva from the patients and immunohistochemically investigated YKL-40 expression. YKL-40 expression was statistically significantly higher in the epithelial , endothelial , and stromal cells of the pterygium tissues than in the control tissues ( P = 0.009 , P = 0.003 , P = 0.002 , respectively). There was no significant correlation between the pterygium subgroups and YKL-40 expression ( P > 0.05). We believe YKL-40 may play a significant role in pterygium pathogenesis.
