  Solution-processed optoelectronic devices are attractive because of the potential low-cost fabrication and the compatibility with flexible substrate. However , the utilization of toxic elements such as lead and cadmium in current optoelectronic devices on the basis of colloidal quantum dots raises environmental concerns. Here we demonstrate that white-light-emitting diodes can be achieved by utilizing non-toxic and environment-friendly gold nanoclusters. Yellow-light-emitting gold nanoclusters were synthesized and capped with trioctylphosphine. These gold nanoclusters were then blended with the blue-light-emitting organic host materials to form the emissive layer. A current efficiency of 0.13 cd/A was achieved. The Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage chromaticity coordinates of ( 0.27 , 0.33) were obtained from our experimental analysis , which is quite close to the ideal pure white emission coordinates ( 0.33 , 0.33). Potential applications include innovative lighting devices and monitor backlight.
