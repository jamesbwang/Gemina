  To study the immunogenicity of EsxA protein of Staphylococcus<pathogen> aureus<pathogen> , the EsxA-pET-28a recombinant plasmid was constructed and the expression product was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting after the positive recombinant plasmid was induced by IPTG. Mice were immunized with purified EsxA protein and then the IgG , IgG1 and IgG2a antibody were detected with indirect ELISA. Then the histopathological examination , bacteria loading and immune protection of immunized mice were studied after challenge with S.<pathogen> aureus<pathogen>. The recombinant protein EsxA was successfully induced and expressed. After immunization the EsxA specific antibody titer could reach 1:900. Bacteria loading and pathological damage of liver , spleen and kidney were reduced after immunization with EsxA in the immunized mice. The protection rate of immunized mice was 75 %. In conclusion , EsxA protein has good immunogenicity.
