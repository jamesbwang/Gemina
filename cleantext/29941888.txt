  DNA has traditionally been used for the programmable design of nanostructures by exploiting its sequence-defined supramolecular recognition. However , control on larger length scales or even hierarchical materials that translate to the macroscale remain difficult to construct. Here , we show that the polymer character of single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA<pathogen>) can be activated via a nucleobase-specific lower critical solution temperature , which provides a unique access to mesoscale structuring mechanisms on larger length scales. We integrate both effects into ssDNA<pathogen> multiblock copolymers that code sequences for phase separation , hybridization and functionalization. Kinetic pathway guidance using temperature ramps balances the counteracting mesoscale phase separation during heating with nanoscale duplex recognition during cooling to yield a diversity of complex all-DNA colloids with control over the internal dynamics and of their superstructures. Our approach provides a facile and versatile platform to add mesostructural layers into hierarchical all-DNA materials. The high density of addressable ssDNA<pathogen> blocks opens routes for applications such as gene delivery , artificial evolution or spatially encoded ( bio) materials.
