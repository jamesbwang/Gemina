  Nitrogen fate and transport through contaminated groundwater systems , where N is both ubiquitous and commonly limits pollutant attenuation , must be re-evaluated given evidence for new potential microbial N pathways. We addressed this by measuring the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic N ( DIN = NH
