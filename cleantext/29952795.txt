  As the burden of chronic non-communicable diseases ( NCDs) rises across sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA) , global donors and governments are exploring strategies to integrate HIV<pathogen> and NCD care. Implementation science is an emerging research paradigm that can help such programs achieve health impact at scale. We define implementation science as a systematic , scientific approach to ask and answer questions about how to deliver what works in populations who need it with greater speed , appropriate fidelity , efficiency , and relevant coverage. We identified achievements and gaps in the application of implementation science to HIV/NCD integration , developed an HIV/NCD implementation science research agenda , and detailed opportunities for capacity building and training. We conducted a systematic review of the application of implementation science methods to integrated HIV/NCD programs in SSA. We searched PubMed , CINAHL , PsycINFO , and EMBASE for evaluations of integrated programs in SSA reporting at least one implementation outcome. We identified 31 eligible studies. We found that most studies used only qualitative , economic , or impact evaluation methods. Only one study used a theoretical framework for implementation science. Acceptability , feasibility , and penetration were the most frequently reported implementation outcomes. Adoption , appropriateness , cost , and fidelity were rare; sustainability was not evaluated. Implementation science has a promising role in supporting HIV/NCD integration , although its impact will be limited unless theoretical frameworks , rigorous study designs , and reliable measures are employed. To help support use of implementation science , we need to build sustainable implementation science capacity. Doing so in SSA and supporting implementation science investigators can help expedite HIV/NCD integration.
