  A radiological evaluation associated to the future mining of grey monazite nodules<symptom> enriched in light rare-earths , from a modest superficial deposit located in the centre of Spain , has been performed at pre-operational level , and the main results are shown in this paper. Although the monazite nodules<symptom> in the deposit are clearly enriched in radionuclides from the uranium and thorium series with activity concentrations higher than 1 Bq/g , the size of these nodules<symptom> ( in the 0.5 mm-2 mm grain size interval) , its refractory behaviour that prevents the leaching or dissemination of natural radionuclides to waters or other ecosystem compartments and consequently the impact in the food chain , and its presence quite diluted in the deposit at concentrations of 2.5-3 kg/m
