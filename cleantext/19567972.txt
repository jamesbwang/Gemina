  The Demand Resources and Individual Effects Model ( DRIVE Model) is a transactional model that integrates Demands- Control-Support and Effort-Reward Imbalance models emphasising the role of individual ( Coping Strategies; Overcommitment) and job characteristics ( Job Demands , Social Support , Decision Latitude , Skill Discretion , Effort , Rewards) in the work-related stress process. The present study aimed to test the DRIVE Model in a sample of 450 Italian nurses and to compare findings with those of a study conducted in a sample of UK nurses. A questionnaire composed of Ways of Coping Checklist-Revised ( WCCL-R); Job Content Questionnaire ( JCQ); ERI Test; Hospital Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Scale ( HADS) was used. Data supported the application of the DRIVE Model to the Italian context , showing significant associations of the individual characteristics of Problem-focused , Seek Advice and Wishful Thinking coping strategies and the job characteristics of Job Demands , Skill Discretion , Decision Latitude , and Effort with perceived levels of Anxiety<symptom> and Depression<symptom> Effort represented the best predictor for psychological health conditions among Italian nurses , and Social Support significantly moderated the effects of Job Demands on perceived levels of Anxiety<symptom>. The comparison study showed significant differences in the risk profiles of Italian and UK nurses. Findings were discussed in order to define focused interventions to promote nurses ' wellbeing.
