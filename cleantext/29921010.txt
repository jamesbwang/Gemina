  Human skin aging is caused by several factors , such as UV irradiation , stress , hormone , and pollution. Wrinkle formation and skin pigmentation are representative features of skin aging. Although EGF and arbutin are used as anti-wrinkle and skin whitening agents , respectively , they have adverse effects on skin. When more cosmeceutical ingredients are added to cosmetic product , adverse effects are also accumulated. For these reasons , multifunctional and safe cosmetic ingredients are in demand. The aim of the present study is to investigate the novel anti-aging agents , AIMP1-derived peptide ( AdP , INCI name: sh-oligopeptide-5/ sh-oligopeptide SP) for cosmetic products. To assess the anti-wrinkle effect of AdP , collagen type I synthesis and fibroblast proliferation were determined on human fibroblasts. The anti-wrinkle effect of AdP was examined by ELISA and cell titer glo assay. To assess the whitening , melanin content and tyrosinase activity were determined on melanocytes. The whitening effect of AdP was examined by melanin measurement and enzyme activity assay. The safety of AdP was determined by cytotoxicity and immunogenicity , CCK-8 and TNF-Î± ELISA assay , respectively. AdP treatment induced the collagen type I synthesis and fibroblast proliferation. Also , AdP treatment inhibited melanin synthesis by regulating tyrosinase activity. The anti-aging effect of AdP is more potent than EGF and albutin. AdP did not show adverse effects. These results show that AdP can be dual functional and safe cosmeceutical agent to prevent skin aging.
