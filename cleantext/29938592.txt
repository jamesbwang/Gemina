  MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are small ribonucleic acids that modulate the expression of downstream target genes. There is considerable evidence of their involvement in many malignancies , such as oesophageal and gastric. We hypothesised altered expressions of pri-miR-124-1 rs531564 and STAT3 rs1053023 polymorphisms in gastric cancer. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 250 patients with gastric cancer and 310 healthy individuals. The RFLP method was applied for determination of pri-miR-124 polymorphism and the AS-PCR method for STAT3 polymorphism. The distribution of rs531564 genotypes in cases and controls was different: the G allele carriers had a reduced gastric cancer risk ( OR = 0.62; 95 % CI = 0.49-0.80 , P = 0.0002). Presence of the minor allele of STAT3 ( rs1053023) was linked with higher risk of gastric cancer ( OR = 2.29; 95 % CI = 1.79-2.93 , P < 0.0001). Compared with the most frequent haplotype C-G ( the SNP order was pri-miR-124-1 ( rs531564) and STAT3 ( rs1053023)) in controls , C-A haplotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of gastric cancer ( OR = 2.28; 95 % CI = 1.64-3.09 , P < 0.0001). There is a strong link between pri-miR-124-1 rs531564 and STAT3 rs1053023 polymorphisms and gastric cancer that may be pathogenic , and so is worthy of further investigation.
