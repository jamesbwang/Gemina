  Evaluation of a hand mass and subsequent surgical treatment is a frequent clinical encounter for the practicing hand surgeon. The clinical evaluation of benign and malignant hand tumors has traditionally focused on diagnosis , surgical excision , and reconstruction. There is a paucity of literature discussing the determining factors for a hand mass biopsy , its appropriate technique , and postbiopsy preparation and handling. This review discusses the approaches of the hand surgeon and orthopedic oncologist to a soft tissue mass in the hand and clarifies the term biopsy. Special attention is focused on preoperative decisions and indications for core needle , incisional , and excisional biopsies of hand masses. In addition , we include a discussion of surgical technique for obtaining a specimen , processing a specimen , and sending a specimen for pathological evaluation. This highlights specimen labeling and type of fixative utilized for pathological evaluation. This review features a section detailing clinical strategies to reduce morbidity associated with evaluation and treatment of benign and malignant hand masses and is based on recommendations from a synopsis of expert opinion and literature review.
