  Calcineurin inhibitors ( CNIs) , such as cyclosporine A and tacrolimus , are widely used immunosuppressive agents for the prevention of post-transplantation rejection and have improved 1-year graft survival rates by up to 90 %. However , CNIs can induce severe reactions , such as acute or chronic allograft nephropathy , hypertension , and neurotoxicity. Because CNIs have varied bioavailabilities , narrow therapeutic ranges , and individual propensities for toxic effects , therapeutic drug monitoring is necessary for all CNIs. Identifying the genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes will help to determine personalized dosage regimens for CNIs , as CNIs are substrates for CYP3A5 and P-glycoprotein ( P-gp , MDR1). CNIs are often concomitantly administered with voriconazole or proton pump inhibitors ( PPIs) , giving rise to drug interaction problems. Voriconazole and PPIs can increase the blood concentrations of CNIs , and both are primarily metabolized by CYP2C19. Thus , it is expected that interactions between CNIs and voriconazole or PPI would be affected by CYP2C19 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms. CNI-induced acute kidney injury ( AKI) is a serious complication of transplantations. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL) and kidney injury molecule 1 ( KIM-1) are noninvasive urinary biomarkers that are believed to be highly sensitive to CNI-induced AKI. In this article , we review the adverse events and pharmacokinetics of CNIs and the biomarkers related to CNIs , including CYP3A5 , CYP2C19 , MDR1 , NGAL , and KIM-1. We hope that these data will help to identify the optimal biomarkers for monitoring CNI-based immunosuppressive therapy after organ transplantation.
