  Nucleic acid nanoparticles ( NANPs) have evolved as a new class of therapeutics with the potential to detect and treat diseases. Despite tremendous advancements in NANP development , their immunotoxicity , one of the major impediments in clinical translation of traditional therapeutic nucleic acids ( TNAs) , has never been fully characterized. Here , we describe the first systematically studied immunological recognition of 25 representative RNA and DNA NANPs selected to have different design principles and physicochemical properties. We discover that , unlike traditional TNAs , NANPs used without a delivery carrier are immunoquiescent. We show that interferons ( IFNs) are the key cytokines triggered by NANPs after their internalization by phagocytic cells , which agrees with predictions based on the experiences with TNAs. However , in addition to type I IFNs , type III IFNs also serve as reliable biomarkers of NANPs , which is usually not characteristic of TNAs. We show that overall immunostimulation relies on NANP shapes , connectivities , and compositions. We demonstrate that , like with traditional TNAs , plasmacytoid dendritic cells serve as the primary interferon producers among all peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with NANPs , and scavenger receptor-mediated uptake and endosomal Toll-like receptor signaling are essential for NANP immunorecognition. The TLR involvement , however , is different from that expected for traditional TNA recognition. Based on these results , we suggest that NANP technology may serve as a prototype of auxiliary molecular language for communication with the immune system and the modulation of immune responses.
