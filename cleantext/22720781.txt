  The synthesis of atomically precise thiolate-stabilized silver ( Ag) nanoclusters is the subject of intense research interest , yet the formation mechanism of such nanoclusters remains obscure. Here , electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is successfully applied to monitor the reaction intermediates formed during the sodium-borohydride-reduction of silver 4-tert-butylbenzenethiolate ( AgSPh-tBu). We demonstrate a unique evolution route to thiolate-stabilized Ag nanoclusters mediated by Ag-thiolate clusters. The Ag-thiolate clusters form in the initial stage of reduction contain tens of Ag atoms and similar number of ligands , and they are transformed into Ag
