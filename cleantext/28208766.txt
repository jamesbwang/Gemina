  This article presents a new sensor fusion method for visual simultaneous localization and mapping ( SLAM) through integration of a monocular camera and a 1D-laser range finder. Such as a fusion method provides the scale estimation and drift correction and it is not limited by volume , e.g. , the stereo camera is constrained by the baseline and overcomes the limited depth range problem associated with SLAM for RGBD cameras. We first present the analytical feasibility for estimating the absolute scale through the fusion of 1D distance information and image information. Next , the analytical derivation of the laser-vision fusion is described in detail based on the local dense reconstruction of the image sequences. We also correct the scale drift of the monocular SLAM using the laser distance information which is independent of the drift error. Finally , application of this approach to both indoor and outdoor scenes is verified by the Technical University of Munich dataset of RGBD and self-collected data. We compare the effects of the scale estimation and drift correction of the proposed method with the SLAM for a monocular camera and a RGBD camera.
