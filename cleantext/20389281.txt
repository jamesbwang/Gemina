  Lysine-specific demethylase 1 ( LSD1) functions as a transcriptional coregulator by modulating histone methylation and has been associated with numerous high-risk cancers. Previously , our group and others identified LSD1 as an upregulated gene in ovarian cancer , and reported that the upregulation of LSD1 was associated with poor prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer. However , the role of LSD1 in ovarian cancer requires further investigation. The present study revealed that the overexpression of LSD1 significantly promoted the proliferation of SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells , while knockdown of LSD1 markedly inhibited cell proliferation and potentiated cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis , supporting LSD1 as an oncogenic protein in ovarian cancer. Mechanistic studies have indicated that LSD1 modulates the expression of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1 , Survivin , B-cell lymphoma-2 ( Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X genes , which are known regulators of cell proliferation. Furthermore , LSD1 knockdown plus cisplatin synergistically impaired cell migration via the induction of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and inhibition of the mesenchymal markers , snail family transcriptional repressor 1 and Vimentin. These data of the present study indicated LSD1 as a potential regulator of ovarian cancer cell progression and suggested an unfavorable role of LSD1 in cisplatin-based regimens.
