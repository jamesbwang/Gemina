  Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors ( PDE-5Is) are the first-line medical treatments for erectile dysfunction ( ED) , but are often restricted in public formularies. This study assesses PDE-5I usage among active-duty service members before and after the addition of sildenafil to the formulary of the Military Health System ( MHS) in 2012. To assess , a cross-sectional evaluation was conducted , utilizing encounter and pharmaceutical claims data from the Military Health System Data Repository between 2010 and 2014. Separate zero-inflated , negative binomial models were used to assess changes in usage rates by prescription and by number of pills issued , for 37947 patients. Increased PDE-5I usage was noted with select comorbidities , notably mental health and neurologic conditions. There was significant proportional variation in medication distribution following inclusion of sildenafil within the MHS formulary , with a minimal demographic impact on medication models. The average number of prescriptions decreased , while the quantity of distributed medications increased. A significant portion of PDE-5I recipients were young men , under 25 years old , who received medications on the first visit , which invites speculation about the effectiveness of treatment and appropriateness of use. Future studies aimed at evaluating prevalence in younger population may be of benefit.
