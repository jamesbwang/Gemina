  Aquaporins are integral membrane proteins that facilitate water flow across biological membranes<symptom>. Their involvement in multiple physiological functions and disease states has prompted intense research to discover water channel activity modulators. However , inhibitors found so far are weak and/or lack specificity. For organic compounds , which lack of high electron-dense atoms , the identification of binding sites is even more difficult. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( NMR) requires large amounts of the protein , and expression and purification of mammalian aquaporins in large quantities is a difficult task. However , since aquaporin Z ( AqpZ) can be purified and expressed in good quantities and has a high similarity to human AQP1 ( ~ 40 % identity) , it can be used as a model for studying the structure and function of human aquaporins. In the present study , we have used solid-state MAS NMR to investigate the binding of a lead compound ( 1- ( 4-methylphenyl) 1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione) to AqpZ , through mapping of chemical shift perturbations in the presence of the compound.
