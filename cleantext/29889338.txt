  Pompe disease is a rare , autosomal , recessive disorder. Alterations in the gene encoding lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase cause impaired glycogen degradation and resultant lysosomal glycogen accumulation. Classic infantile-onset Pompe disease ( IPD) manifests soon after birth , severe cases have complete/near complete enzyme deficiency. IPD is associated with a broad spectrum of non-specific clinical features , and diagnostic delays are common. Without treatment , death typically occurs within the first 2 years of life. We present case experiences to help expand paediatricians ' understanding of factors contributing to diagnostic delay , clinical decline and to highlight the need for timely therapy. Data were extracted from IPD cases managed at our hospital. Key aspects of clinical presentation , diagnosis , genetic variations , management and overall outcomes were collated then compared with what is already known in the literature. We report four IPD cases ( three female). Two patients were cross-reactive immunological material negative. Age at symptom onset was 3-9 months , presenting clinical features were varied , and confirmatory diagnosis was significantly delayed in one patient. In concert with the literature , cardiomegaly , ventricular hypertrophy and delayed developmental milestones were seen in all four cases. Our cases demonstrate a range of disease severity , response to enzyme replacement therapy and antibody development. Significant immune responses were seen in two cases ( one cross-reactive immunological material positive); despite immunomodulation therapy , both were associated with fatal outcomes. Timely diagnosis and initiation of enzyme replacement therapy is critical to patient outcomes as IPD progresses rapidly and irreversible changes in clinical status may occur during the delay.
