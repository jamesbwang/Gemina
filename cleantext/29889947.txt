  American Indians and Alaska Natives ( AI/ANs) constitute 2.2 % of Hawai'i 's population. Unfortunately , very little is known about the mental health of AI/AN youth in Hawai'i. The purpose of this study ( N = 7,214; 1992-1996) was to describe AI/AN adolescents versus non-AI/AN youth regarding demographic , social , and mental health variables. The results suggested that AI/AN adolescents were more open to different types of social-emotional supports , had relatively more non-traditional families with a smaller social network , and may be more vulnerable to academic and health difficulties , with particular risk for mental health issues for mixed AI/AN-Native Hawaiians. Implications are discussed , including intervention , socio-political issues , and future research.
