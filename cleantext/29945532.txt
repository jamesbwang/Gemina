  Letermovir is an antiviral agent recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus infection in adult patients that are cytomegalovirus-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Liver toxicity was not observed in the clinical trials that led to its approval. This report highlights a case of letermovir associated transaminitis with successful rechallenge through peak and recovery of the hepatic serum enzymes. Because there is currently no published evidence to support the adverse event , the temporal relationship and response to rechallenge that was observed is essential to establishing the probable causality in this case.
