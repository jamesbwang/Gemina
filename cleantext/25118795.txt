  Pregnancy is a time of increased HIV<pathogen> acquisition risk and pregnancy reduces concentrations of antiretrovirals used for treatment. We assessed whether pregnancy lowers concentrations of tenofovir ( TFV) and tenofovir-diphosphate ( TFV-DP) among HIV-uninfected women using oral preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP). We analyzed data from an open-label PrEP study , comparing concentrations of TFV in plasma and TFV-DP in dried blood spots ( DBS) among 37 pregnant women and 97 nonpregnant women. Analyses controlled for adherence from daily electronic monitoring. The average plasma concentration of TFV among pregnant women was 34.7 ng/ml with 22.2 average recorded doses over the prior month versus 86.5 ng/ml with 23.1 doses among nonpregnant women. After controlling for adherence , TFV concentrations were 58 % lower among pregnant women , a statistically significant difference of -50.4 ng/ml ( 95 % CI -68.3 to -32.5). The average TFV-DP concentration was 450.3 fmol/punch among pregnant women and 636.7 fmol/punch among nonpregnant women. This difference was not statistically significant after adjusting for adherence; however , among those with quantifiable TFV-DP , concentrations were 27 % lower during pregnancy ( -202 fmol/punch ( 95 % CI -384 to -19)). Among participants with samples before and during pregnancy , there were significant decreases during pregnancy , controlling for adherence: -28.1 ng/ml TFV ( 95 % CI -52.3 to -4.0) and -289.2 fmol/punch TFV-DP ( 95 % CI -439.0 to -139.3). Consistent with studies among HIV-infected women on ART , we found TFV and TFV-DP concentrations were lower during pregnancy. There is no established TFV concentration threshold to achieve HIV<pathogen> prevention. Additional pharmacokinetic studies and studies of PrEP efficacy in pregnancy are needed.
