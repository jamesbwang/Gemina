  Bacterial flagellar motility , an important virulence factor , is energized by a rotary motor localized within the flagellar basal body. The rotor module consists of a large framework ( the C-ring) , composed of the FliG , FliM and FliN proteins. FliN and FliM contacts the FliG torque ring to control the direction of flagellar rotation. We report that structure-based models constrained only by residue coevolution can recover the binding interface of atomic X-ray dimer complexes with remarkable accuracy ( approx. 1 Ã… RMSD). We propose a model for FliM-FliN heterodimerization , which agrees accurately with homologous interfaces as well as
