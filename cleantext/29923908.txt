  Recent studies have identified kinase fusions in Spitzoid melanocytic neoplasms , and approximately 10 % of Spitzoid neoplasms harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK) rearrangements and corresponding ALK immunoreactivity. Deep penetrating nevi ( DPN) , a subset of melanocytic neoplasms , have histologic and immunohistochemical overlap that have historically supported classification of DPN with blue/cellular blue nevi ( CBN). However , HRAS mutations have rarely been detected in DPN , thereby also linking them to Spitz nevi. The purpose of this study was to see if DPN or CBN possess ALK rearrangements , thereby providing more evidence that these melanocytic lesions<symptom> may be pathogenetically related to Spitzoid neoplasms. Using ALK immunohistochemistry as a surrogate for ALK rearrangement , the authors examined 26 DPN , 30 CBN , and 4 conventional blue nevi. ALK immunoreactive cases underwent fluorescent in situ hybridization to investigate for the presence of ALK gene rearrangement. Patchy and focal ALK immunostaining was found in only 1 case of DPN ( 1/26 , 3.8 %). Seven cases of CBN ( 7/30; 23 %) showed ALK immunostaining ( 6 focal/patchy , 1 strong and diffuse). Fluorescent in situ hybridization using ALK break-apart probes showed various degrees of gain of 2p23 and rare ALK break-apart signals. Four CBN showed ALK rearrangement in 2 % -4 % of cells. Two cases of CBN showed gain of 2p23 in 10 % -20 % of cells. In our study , ALK rearrangements are uncommon in both CBN and DPN , making ALK an unlikely driver in tumorigenesis and classification of these melanocytic variants. However , our study did identify ALK molecular changes and immunohistochemical staining patterns that have not been previously described in CBN or DPN.
