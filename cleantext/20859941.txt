  Polystyrene ( PS) nanoparticle films with non-close-packed arrays were prepared by using ion beam etching technology. The effects of etching time , beam current , and voltage on the size reduction of PS particles were well investigated. A slow etching rate , about 9.2 nm/min , is obtained for the nanospheres with the diameter of 100 nm. The rate does not maintain constant with increasing the etching time. This may result from the thermal energy accumulated gradually in a long-time bombardment of ion beam. The etching rate increases nonlinearly with the increase of beam current , while it increases firstly then reach its saturation with the increase of beam voltage. The diameter of PS nanoparticles can be controlled in the range from 34 to 88 nm. Based on the non-close-packed arrays of PS nanoparticles , the ordered silicon ( Si) nanopillars with their average diameter of 54 nm are fabricated by employing metal-assisted chemical etching technique. Our results pave an effective way to fabricate the ordered nanostructures with the size less than 100 nm.
