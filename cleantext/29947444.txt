  The review examined the effectiveness of Active Support ( RQ1) and stakeholders ' experiences of the model ( RQ2). Data were meta-analysed ( RQ1; studies = 14) and synthesized narratively ( RQ2; studies = 10). By follow-up ( 6 months post-training) , effect sizes ( RQ1) for resident total activity engagement were significant and ranged from small ( d = 0.33 , 95 % CIs: 0.10-0.50) to large ( Tau-U = 0.95 , 95 % CIs: 0.64-1.25) depending on study design. Follow-up changes in staff assistance were moderate ( d = 0.56 , 95 % CIs: 0.23-0.89; Tau-U 0.63 , 95 % CIs: 0.32-0.93) and large for quality of support ( d = 1.03 , 95 % CIs: 0.61-1.44). Other outcomes did not change. Active Support was more effective following complete staff training , in larger settings , at lower staff-to-resident ratios and with less experienced staff. Active Support training and outcomes were valued by staff and residents ( RQ2) , and staff experienced increased job satisfaction. Lower staff turnover and organizational readiness appear crucial for maintaining implementation.
