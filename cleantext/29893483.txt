  Formic acid-induced controlled-release hydrolysis of sugar-rich microalgae ( Scenedesmus) over the Sn-Beta catalyst was found to be a highly efficient process for producing lactic acid as a platform chemical. One-pot reaction with a very high lactic acid yield of 83.0 % was realized in a batch reactor using water as the solvent. Under the attack of formic acid , the cell wall of Scenedesmus was disintegrated , and hydrolysis of the starch inside the cell was strengthened in a controlled-release mode , resulting in a stable and relatively low glucose concentration. Subsequently , the Sn-Beta catalyst was employed for the efficient conversion of glucose into lactic acid with stable catalytic performance through isomerization , retro-aldol and de-/ rehydration reactions. Thus , the hydrolysis of polysaccharides and the catalytic conversion of the monosaccharide into lactic acid was realized by the combination of an organic Br√∏nsted acid and a heterogeneous Lewis acid catalyst.
