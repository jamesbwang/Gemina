  The worldwide prevalence of NDM-1-producing bacteria has drastically undermined the clinical efficacy of the last line antibiotic of carbapenems , prompting a need to devise effective strategy to preserve their clinical value. Our previous studies have shown that ebselen can restore the efficacy of meropenem against a laboratory strain that produces NDM-1. Here we report the construction of a focused compound library of 1,2-benzisoselenazol-3 ( 2H)- one derivatives which comprise a total of forty-six candidate compounds. The structure-activity relationship of these compounds and their potential to serve as an adjuvant to enhance the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem against a collection of clinical NDM-1-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates was examined. Drug combination assays indicated that these derivatives exhibited synergistic antimicrobial activity when used along with meropenem , effectively restoring the activity of carbapenems against the resistant strains tested in a Galleria mellonella larvae in vivo infection model. The mode of inhibition of one compound , namely 11_a38 , which was depicted when tested on the purified NDM-1 enzyme , indicated that it could covalently bind to the enzyme and displaced one zinc ion from the active site. Overall , this study provides a novel 1,2-benzisoselenazol-3 ( 2H)- one scaffold that exhibits strong synergistic antimicrobial activity with carbapenems , and low cytotoxicity. The prospect of application of such compounds as carbapenem adjuvants warrants further evaluation.
