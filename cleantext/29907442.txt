  Mitral annulus ( MA) enlargement can be observed in various cardiac conditions but respective influence of left atrial<symptom> ( LA) and left ventricle ( LV) size remained unclear. In 120 patients who underwent a clinically indicated 3D-transesophageal-echocardiography , 30 atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) , 30 secondary mitral regurgitation ( SMR) , 30 primary myxomatous mitral regurgitation ( PMR) and 30 mitral stenosis ( MS) , we evaluated the association between MA area ( MA-area) and LA volume ( LAvol) measured using the biplane area-length method , end-diastolic ( LVEDV) and end-systolic ( LVESV) volumes measured using the biplane Simpson method. MA-area was measured based on 3D datasets using QLab10. MA-area was correlated to LVEDV ( r = 0.42 , p < 0.0001) , LVESV ( r = 0.29 , p = 0.001) but more markedly to LAvol ( r = 0.62 , p < 0.0001). Correlation between MA-area and LAvol was sustained in all subsets whereas MA-area was not correlated to LVEDV and LVESV in patients with SMR and with PMR ( all p > 0.10). In multivariate analysis main predictors of MA-area were LAvol ( p < 0.0001) and myxomatous etiology of MR ( p = 0.0003) followed by LVEDV ( p = 0.006) and LVESV ( p = 0.02). In a population of patients with a wide range of LA/LV size related to various conditions , LA volume and myxomatous MR etiology appeared as main predictors of MA size whereas LV size had a more modest influence.
