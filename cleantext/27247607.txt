  Corilagin is a component of Phyllanthus urinaria extract and has been found of possessing anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidative , and anti-tumour properties in clinic treatments. However , the underlying mechanisms in anti-cancer particularly of its induction of cell death in human breast cancer remain undefined. Our research found that corilagin-induced apoptotic and autophagic cell death depending on reactive oxygen species ( ROS) in human breast cancer cell , and it occurred in human breast cancer cell ( MCF-7) only comparing with normal cells. The expression of procaspase-8 , procaspase-3 , PARP , Bcl-2 and procaspase-9 was down-regulated while caspase-8 , cleaved PARP , caspase-9 and Bax were up-regulated after corilagin treatment , indicating apoptosis mediated by extrinsic and mitochondrial pathways occurred in MCF-7 cell. Meanwhile , autophagy mediated by suppressing Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway was detected with an increase in autophagic vacuoles and LC3-II conversion. More significantly , inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine diphosphate salt ( CQ) remarkably enhanced apoptosis , while the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk failed in affecting autophagy , suggesting that corilagin-induced autophagy functioned as a survival mechanism in MCF-7 cells. In addition , corilagin induced intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS) generation , when reduced by ROS scavenger NAC , apoptosis and autophagy were both down-regulated. Nevertheless , in SK-BR3 cell which expressed RIP3 , necroptosis inhibitor Nec-1 could not alleviate cell death induced by corilagin , indicating necroptosis was not triggered. Subcutaneous tumour growth in nude mice was attenuated by corilagin , consisting with the results in vitro. These results imply that corilagin inhibits cancer cell proliferation through inducing apoptosis and autophagy which regulated by ROS release.
