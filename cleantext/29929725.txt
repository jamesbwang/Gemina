  Contralateral sensorineural hearing loss ( CSNHL) after vestibular schwannoma ( VS) is a severe complication , especially in those cases in which hearing preservation in the operated side was not possible. There are several theories that attempt to explain this issue , but there is no established guideline of treatment. We report 4 patients treated in our institution who developed a severe CSNHL after surgery. Of the 185 cases of VS treated with surgery , 4 patients ( 2.2 %) developed a CSNHL after VS surgery. After medical treatment , partial recovery of hearing occurred in one patient the other 3 patients presented a well-established severe SNHL. Established treatment guidelines do not exist , but the use of high doses of corticosteroids has been recommended and cochlear implant in cases with no recovery and complete hearing loss may be useful.
