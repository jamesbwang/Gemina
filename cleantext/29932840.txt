  Optimizing the production of the high-value renewables such as OMEGAs through pathway engineering requires an in-depth understanding of the structure-function relationship of genes involved in the OMEGA biosynthetic pathways. In this preliminary study , our rationale is to identify and characterize the âˆ¼ 221 putative genes involved in production of OMEGAs using bioinformatic analysis from the Streptophyte ( plants) , Chlorophyte ( green algae<pathogen>) , Rhodophyta ( red algae<pathogen>) , and Bacillariophyta ( diatoms) lineages based on their phylogenomic profiling , conserved motif/domain organization and physico-chemical properties. The MEME suite predicted 12 distinct protein domains , which are conserved among these putative genes. The phylogenomic analysis of the putative candidate genes ( such as FAD2 ( delta-12 desaturase); ECR ( enoyl-CoA reductase); FAD2 ( delta-12 desaturase); ACOT ( acyl CoA thioesterase); ECH ( enoyl-CoA hydratase); and ACAT ( acetyl-CoA acyltransferase)) with similar domains and motif patterns were remarkably well conserved. Furthermore , the subcellular network prediction of OMEGA biosynthetic pathway genes revealed a unique interaction between the light-dependent chlorophyll biosynthesis and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , which predicts a major cross-talk between the key essential pathways. Such bioinformatic analysis will provide insights in finding the key regulatory genes to optimize the productivity of OMEGAs in microalgal cell factories.
