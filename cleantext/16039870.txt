  UV radiation in sunlight has long been recognized as the main exogenous cause of skin carcinomas. We present a brief historical perspective on the progress in understanding the pathogenesis of skin carcinomas , and recent advances. Sun-exposed skin carries numerous UV-related mutations , and skin carcinomas rank among the tumors with the highest mutational loads. In this multitude of mutations only a few are crucial in driving the tumor. Some are known from hereditary ( skin) cancer syndromes<disease> and other recurrent ones have been validated in transgenic mice. Considering the continuous renewal of the epidermis , the question arises whether the lifelong residing stem cells are the main targets in skin carcinogenesis , a multistep process that would require ample time to evolve. Therefore , classic quiescent stem cells have been studied as potential tumor-initiating cells , as well as more recently discovered actively dividing stem cells ( either Lgr5 + or Lgr6 +). Interesting differences have emerged between experimental UV and two-stage chemical carcinogenesis , e.g. , the latter appears to originate from follicular stem cells , in contrast to the former.
