  The activated JAK2-V617F mutant is very frequently found in myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPNs) , and its inhibitor ruxolitinib has been in clinical use , albeit with limited efficacies. Here , we examine the signaling mechanisms from JAK2-V617F and responses to ruxolitinib in JAK2-V617F-positive leukemic cell lines , including PVTL-2 , newly established from a patient with post-MPN secondary acute myeloid leukemia<disease> , and the widely used model cell line HEL. We have found that ruxolitinib downregulated the mTORC1/S6K/4EBP1 pathway at least partly through inhibition of the STAT5/Pim -2 pathway with concomitant downregulation of c-Myc , MCL-1 , and BCL-xL as well as induction of autophagy in these cells. Ruxolitinib very efficiently inhibited proliferation but only modestly induced apoptosis. However , inhibition of BCL-xL/BCL -2 by the BH3 mimetics ABT-737 and navitoclax or BCL-xL by A-1331852 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis involving activation of Bak and Bax synergistically with ruxolitinib in HEL cells. On the other hand , the putative pan-BH3 mimetic obatoclax as well as chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 inhibited autophagy at its late stage and induced apoptosis in PVTL-2 cells synergistically with ruxolitinib. The present study suggests that autophagy as well as the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members , regulated at least partly by the mTORC1 pathway downstream of STAT5/Pim -2 , protects JAK2-V617F-positive leukemic cells from ruxolitinib-induced apoptosis depending on cell types and may contribute to development of new strategies against JAK2-V617F-positive neoplasms.
