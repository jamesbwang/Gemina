  In the present study , the 75 % alcoholic fractionation of excretory-secretory ( ES) antigen isolated from 200 to 300 live P. epiclitum was assessed for its diagnostic potential for the detection of caprine amphistomosis by using antibody detection enzyme immunoassay. Prior to enzyme immunoassay , 75 % alcoholic fractionation of excretory-secretory ( ES) antigen was subjected to SDS- PAGE and western blot analysis for the presence of immunoreactive polypeptides. SDS-PAGE analysis of ES antigen resolved a total 7 polypeptides bands of size 56 , 27 , 25 , 22.5 , 12 , 11 and 10 kDa. Western blot analysis revealed only two immunoreactive polypeptides ( 11 kDa and 12 kDa) when polypeptides resolved in SDS-PAGE were probed with known positive pooled serum. None of the polypeptides showed reactions with pooled known negative serum. The working dilutions of antigen , sera and conjugates were determined by checkerboard titration for employing ELISA and cut-off O.D. was calculated 0.616 by using the mean absorbance value of 11 negative kid sera. The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA was found to be 100 % and 86.76 % , respectively. As per kappa value estimation , the strength of agreement was found to be good. Antibodies to 75 % alcoholic fractionation of ES antigen was detected in 20 % goats ( n = 160) of either sex , although faecal examination detected 10.6 % goats to be infected with amphistomosis. The study confirmed that 75 % alcoholic fractionation of ES antigen of P. epiclitum based ELISA had good value for serodiagnosis of caprine amphistomosis.
