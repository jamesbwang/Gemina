  Levels of plant secondary metabolites are not static and often change in relation to plant ontogeny. They also respond to abiotic and biotic changes in the environment , e.g. , they often increase in response to biotic stress , such as herbivory. In contrast with short-lived annual plant species , especially those with growing periods of less than 2-3 months , investment in defensive compounds of vegetative tissues in biennial and perennial species may also vary over the course of an entire growing season. In garden experiments , we investigated the dynamics of secondary metabolites , i.e. glucosinolates ( GSLs) in the perennial wild cabbage (
