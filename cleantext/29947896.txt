  Asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation ( AF4) coupled with UV-Vis spectroscopy , multi-angle light scattering ( MALS) and refractive index ( RI) detection has been applied for the characterization of MIL-100 ( Fe) nanoMOFs ( metal-organic frameworks) loaded with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI) drugs for the first time. Empty nanoMOFs and nanoMOFs loaded with azidothymidine derivatives with three different degrees of phosphorylation were examined: azidothymidine ( AZT , native drug) , azidothymidine monophosphate ( AZT-MP) , and azidothymidine triphosphate ( AZT-TP). The particle size distribution and the stability of the nanoparticles when interacting with drugs have been determined in a time frame of 24 h. Main achievements include detection of aggregate formation in an early stage and monitoring nanoMOF morphological changes as indicators of their interaction with guest molecules. AF4-MALS proved to be a useful methodology to analyze nanoparticles engineered for drug delivery applications and gave fundamental data on their size distribution and stability.
