  The administration of inhaled epoprostenol ( iEPO) through noninvasive routes of ventilator support systems has never been previously evaluated. Describe the use of iEPO when administered through noninvasive routes of ventilator support systems. Critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit who received iEPO through noninvasive routes were analyzed. Improvements in respiratory<symptom> status<symptom> and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated. Safety end points assessed included hypotension<symptom> , rebound hypoxemia<symptom> , significant bleeding , and thrombocytopenia<symptom>. A total of 36 patients received iEPO through noninvasive routes: high-flow oxygen therapy through nasal cannula , n = 29 ( 81 %) and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation , n = 7 ( 19 %). Sixteen patients had improvement in their respiratory<symptom> status<symptom>: mean decrease in fraction of inspired oxygen ( FiO
