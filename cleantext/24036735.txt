  Mild traumatic brain injuries ( mTBI) are common during adolescence , and limited clinical evidence suggests that a younger age at first exposure to a mTBI may lead to worse long-term outcomes. In this study , we hypothesized that a mTBI during adolescence would predispose toward poorer neurobehavioral and neuropathological outcomes after a subsequent injury at adulthood. Mice received a mild weight drop injury ( mTBI) at adolescence ( postnatal day 35; P35) and/or at adulthood ( P70). Mice were randomized to 6 groups:
