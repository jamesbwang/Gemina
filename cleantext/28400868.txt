  There are limited efficacious treatment options for severe osteoarthritis of the knee ( OAK). The Low Molecular Weight Fraction of 5 % human serum Albumin ( LMWF-5A) is in development to treat severe OAK. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of LMWF-5A for the signs and symptoms of OAK. This 12-week randomized , double-blind , controlled clinical trial was conducted at thirteen sites across the United States. Patients with symptomatic , severe OAK ( Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4 disease) who were fully ambulatory and had no other conditions interfering with the study knee were randomized to a single 4 ml intra-articular injection of LMWF-5A or saline , randomized 6:1. The primary endpoint was Outcome Measures in Rheumatology-Osteoarthritis Research Society International ( OMERACT-OARSI) responder rate ( %) , examined with a one-sided exact binomial test compared to a clinically meaningful response rate of 30 %. Efficacy of LMWF-5A was also evaluated as controlled responder ( %) , defined as 20 % improvements in both pain and function , compared to historical saline control from three previous trials. Safety was examined as the incidence and severity of adverse events ( AEs). This trial was registered ( clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03182686). In total , 168 patients were randomized; 144 subjects treated with LMWF-5A were analysed. Overall , 71 % ( 95 % CI: 63.4 % -78.3 %) of subjects treated with LMWF-5A met the OMERACT-OARSI responder criteria , exceeding the 30 % threshold ( LMWF-5A provides relief for the signs and symptoms of severe osteoarthritis , and may be an alternative therapeutic treatment option for patients with severe osteoarthritis of the knee.
