  Some cardiovascular complications in patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease may be caused by structurally and functionally modified lipoproteins. Redox status ( advanced oxidation protein products ( AOPPs)) , prooxidant-antioxidant balance<symptom> , total protein sulfhydryl ( SH-groups) , and paraoxonase 1 ( PON1) activity were assessed in 77 renal patients and 20 controls. Lipoproteins were isolated using ultracentrifugation. PON1 , PON3 , and pentraxin-3 concentration were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). Dyslipidemia-Oxy-Inflammation ( DOI) score was calculated as a sum of dyslipidemia , oxidative stress , and inflammation<symptom> scores. The dyslipidemia score ( P < .001) , oxy score ( P < .01) , inflammation<symptom> score ( P < .001) , and the DOI score ( P < .001) were higher in patient groups compared with controls. The very-low-density lipoprotein ( VLDL) fraction contained the highest amount of AOPP ( P < .001) compared with other lipoprotein fractions in all groups. The low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) fraction contained elevated AOPP in all groups compared with the high-density lipoprotein ( HDL) fraction ( P < .001). Significant positive correlation was observed between AOPP in LDL fraction and DOI score ( ρ = 0.510 , P < .01). Dyslipidemia , oxidative stress , and inflammation<symptom> play an interactive role in renal disease and are mutually associated with redox status in VLDL , LDL , and HDL lipoproteins in plasma of renal patients.
