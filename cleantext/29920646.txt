  Biallelic GBA mutations cause Gaucher disease ( GD) , and heterozygous carriers are at risk for synucleinopathies. No founder GBA mutations in French-Canadians are known. GBA was fully sequenced using targeted next generation and Sanger sequencing in French-Canadian Parkinson disease ( PD) patients ( n = 436) , rapid eye movement<symptom> ( REM)- sleep behavior disorder ( RBD) patients ( n = 189) and controls ( n = 891). Haplotype , identity-by-descent ( IBD) and principal component analyses ( PCA) were performed using single nucleotide polymorphism-chip data. Data on GD patients from Toronto and Montreal were collected from patients ' files. A GBA p.Trp378Gly mutation was identified in two RBD and four PD patients ( 1 % of all patients combined) , and not in controls. The two RBD patients had converted to DLB within 3 years of their diagnosis. Haplotype , IBD and PCA analysis demonstrated that this mutation is from a single founder. Out of 167 GD patients screened , 15 ( 9.0 %) carried the p.Trp378Gly mutation , all in trans with p.Asn370Ser. Three ( 20 %) of the GD patients with the p.Trp378Gly mutation had developed Parkinsonism , and 11 patients had family history of PD. The p.Trp378Gly mutation is the first French-Canadian founder GBA mutation to be described , which leads to synucleinopathies and to GD type 1 when in compound heterozygosity with p.Asn370Ser.
