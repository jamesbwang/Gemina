  Fluoride is frequently added to drinking water supplies , various food products , toothpaste , and mouth<symptom> rinses to prevent tooth damage. However , at high concentrations , fluoride can cause fluorosis and damage to the brain tissue due to its excitotoxicity and oxidative stress effects. The damage of the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum can lead to motor coordination disorders. The present study aimed at investigating the effects of sodium fluoride on the motor coordination and the number of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum of rats. Adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups , namely a control group which received reverse osmosis distilled water and three treated groups which received sodium fluoride at doses of 5 , 10 , or 20 mg/kg bw. The treatment lasted for 30 days. The motor coordination of the rats was examined using a rotarod prior and subsequent to the treatments. The number of Purkinje cells was estimated using physical fractionator design. The numbers of Purkinje cells of the F10 and F20 groups were significantly lower than that of the control group. No significant differences in the results of the motor coordination test were found. The administration of sodium fluoride at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg bw caused a decrease in the number of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in rats.
