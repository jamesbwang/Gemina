  Fungal polysaccharides are mainly taken orally , so it is very important to study the absorption mechanism of which in vivo for understanding its biological activities. In this work , a polysaccharide fraction ( GLP) was purified from G. lucidum by water extraction and alcohol precipitation. Physicochemical characterization indicated that GLP had a molecular weight of 108 kDa and consisted of glucose ( 35.56 %) , xylose ( 40.11 %) , rhamnose ( 16.45 %) and l-arabinose ( 7.88 %) in a molar radio of 4.51: 5.09: 2.88: 1.0. GLP was taken by Caco-2 cells through the pathway of macropinocytosis and it was a well-absorbed biological macromolecule testified by Papp value. Sugar transporters ( SGLT1 and GLUT2) played different roles at different absorption stages of GLP , and the absorption of GLP during digestion in mice model was a time-dependent process. All these results could contribute to explore the absorption mechanism of polysaccharides in body.
