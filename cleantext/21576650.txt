  Residual SYNTAX score ( rSS) and its derived indexes including SYNTAX revascularization index ( SRI) and clinical rSS had been developed to quantify and describe the extent of incomplete revascularization. This study was conducted to explore the utility of the three scores among real-world patients after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). From January 2013 to December 2013 , patients underwent PCI treatment at Fuwai Hospital were included. The primary endpoints were all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The secondary endpoints were myocardial infarction , revascularization , stroke , and stent thrombosis. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to determine the outcomes. Cox multivariable regression was to test the associations between scores and all-cause mortality. A total of 10,344 patients were finally analyzed in this study. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that greater residual coronary lesions<symptom> quantified by rSS and its derived indexes were associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. However , after multivariate analysis , only clinical rSS was an independent predictor of 2-year all-cause death ( hazard ratio: 1.02 , 95 % confidence interval: 1.01-1.03 , P < 0.01). By receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis , clinical rSS had superior predictability of 2-year all-cause death than rSS and SRI ( area under ROC curve ( AUC): 0.59 vs. 0.56 vs. 0.56 , all P < 0.01) , whereas rSS was superior in predicting repeat revascularization than clinical rSS and SRI ( AUC: 0.62 vs. 0.61 vs. 0.61; all P < 0.01). When comparing the predictive capability of rSS â‰¥ 8 with SRI < 70 % , their predictabilities were not significantly different. This study indicates that all three indexes ( rSS , clinical rSS , and SRI) are able to risk-stratify patients and predict 2-year outcomes after PCI. However , their prognostic capabilities are different.
