  To investigate the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE) gene I/D and A2350 G polymorphisms with environmental factors interaction on essential hypertension in the Han nationality. A population-based case-control study was conducted , and 1010 patients with hypertension and 1030 normal controls were recruited from Lanxi Country rural , Heilongjiang Province. ACE gene two polymorphism sites were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP). Using multivariate Logistic regression to analysis the interaction between gene polymorphisms and environmental factors. The distributions of ACE two polymorphism sites genotypes in control group were in accordance with the HardyWeinberg equilibrium ( HWE). Multivariate Logistic analysis showed that age , gender , family history of hypertension , BMI , TG and high-density lipoprotein enter the model and were the risk factors for essential hypertension ( P < 0. 05) , especially , family history of hypertension ( Ï‡ ~ 2 = 53. 488 , OR = 2. 140 , 95 % CI 1. 746-2. 625). The interaction analysis between two sites genotype and environmental factors , noted that there were statistically significant combination effect between genotypes of the two sites and the factors of age , gender , BMI , TG and high-density lipoprotein. There was multiplication interaction only between I/D and age ( P = 0. 0356 , OR = 1. 021 , 95 % CI 1. 001-1. 021). There are combination effect between ACE gene I/D and A2350 G polymorphisms with multiple environmental factors , which are likely to increase the risk of suffering from essential hypertension.
