  This study investigated the ecology , epidemiology and plasmid characteristics of extended-spectrum cephalosporin ( ESC)- resistant E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> in healthy pigs over a period of 4 years ( 2013-2016) following the withdrawal of ESCs. High carriage rates of ESC-resistant E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> were demonstrated in 2013 ( 86.6 %) and 2014 ( 83.3 %) , compared to 2015 ( 22 %) and 2016 ( 8.5 %). ESC resistance identified among E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> isolates was attributed to the carriage of an IncI1 ST-3 plasmid ( pCTXM1-MU2) encoding bla
