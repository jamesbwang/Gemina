  Prolonged corrected QT ( QTc) has been identified as a risk factor for malignant arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Caucasian studies have shown a definite relationship between QTc prolongation and Cardiac Autonomic Neuropathy ( CAN) in diabetic subjects. To determine the prevalence of prolonged QTc in Black diabetic individuals with CAN and to ascertain how prolonged QTc correlated with the severity of CAN among these patients. A total of 176 adult diabetic subjects were studied , 87 males and 89 females. There was a control group of non-diabetic individuals. Cardiac autonomic function was assessed using five cardiovascular autonomic function tests. CAN was diagnosed if 2 or more of these tests were abnormal. Severity of CAN was determined according to the number of abnormal tests. QTc > 0.440 was regarded as prolonged. Fifty-one out of the 176 diabetic subjects ( 29 %) had CAN. The prevalence of prolonged QTc in diabetic subjects with CAN was 12 %. QTc was prolonged in 1.6 % and 0.6 % of diabetic individuals without CAN and controls respectively. Although QTc correlated strongly with cardiac autonomic function neuropathy , there was no definite relationship between QTc prolongation and severity of CAN. This study in a Black population is in agreement with the well-known relationship between QTc prolongation and CAN reported in Caucasian studies. In view of the wide variability of QTc in this study population , it is suggested that relative QTc increase may be a better indicator of CAN than a definite QTc prolongation of greater than 0.440.
