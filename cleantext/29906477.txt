  The amine transaminase from Vibrio<pathogen> fluvialis<pathogen> ( Vf-ATA) is an attractive enzyme with applications within Biocatalysis for the preparation of chiral amines. Various catalytic properties of Vf-ATA have been investigated , but a biophysical characterization of its stability has been lacking. Today , the industrial application of Vf-ATA is limited by its low operational stability. In order to enhance the knowledge regarding the structural stability of ATAs , general characterizations of different ATAs are required. In this work , the stability of Vf-ATA was explored. First , the affinity between enzyme and pyridoxal-5 '- phosphate ( PLP) ( K
