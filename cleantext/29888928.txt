  Little is known concerning the relative effectiveness of LTRAs compared to ICSs as monotherapy or LABA as add-on therapy in the Asian population. In this retrospective cohort study , we examined the comparative effectiveness of montelukast to ICS as a first-line monotherapy and as an add-on in comparison with LABA on asthma exacerbations among Asian and non-Hispanic white persistent asthma patients in a large managed care organization. The three add-on comparisons were montelukast plus low-dose ICS versus LABA plus low-dose ICS , montelukast plus low-dose ICS versus medium-dose ICS , and montelukast plus medium-dose ICS versus LABA plus medium-dose ICS. Patients were identified based on ICD-9 diagnosis codes and administrative pharmacy dispensing. Exacerbations were defined as asthma emergency department visit or hospitalization , or asthma outpatient visits requiring systemic corticosteroid dispensing. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were balanced by using inverse probability treatment weighting. Multivariable robust Poisson and Cox-proportional hazards regression models were applied to estimate rate ratios and hazard ratios. Compared with low-dose ICS monotherapy , montelukast monotherapy evidenced a lower incidence rate ( RR 0.89 , CI 0.79-0.99 , p = 0.03) but similar hazard rate ( HR 0.96 , CI 0.86-1.06 , p = 0.43) of asthma exacerbation in white patients 12 years of age or older. No difference was observed in Asian patients or in white children 4-11 years of age. All other comparisons did not reveal a statistically significant difference in incidence or hazard rate. In a real-world comparative effectiveness study , asthma exacerbation rates were similar among guideline alternative controller regimens in Asians and whites.
