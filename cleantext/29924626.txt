  Responding to changes in the surrounding environment , aerosol particles can grow by water condensation changing rapidly in composition and changing dramatically in viscosity. The timescale for growth is important to establish for particles undergoing hydration processes in the atmosphere or during inhalation. Using an electrodynamic balance<symptom> , we report direct measurements at -7.5 , 0 , and 20 °C of timescales for hygroscopic condensational growth on a range of model hygroscopic aerosol systems. These extend from viscous aerosol particles containing a single saccharide solute ( sucrose , glucose , raffinose , or trehalose) and a starting viscosity equivalent to a glass of ∼ 10
