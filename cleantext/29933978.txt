  Myclobutanil is a widely used triazole fungicide , comprising two enantiomers with different fungicidal activities , non-target toxicities , and environmental fates. The enantioselective effects of myclobutanil on fumonisin B ( FB) production by Fusarium<pathogen> verticillioides<pathogen> , an important pathogen , have not yet been investigated. In the present study , the fungicidal activities of rac-myclobutanil and its enantiomers on F.<pathogen> verticillioides<pathogen> cultured on maize-based media were studied under different water activity and temperature conditions. The FB levels were measured to assess the enantioselective effects on FB production when F.<pathogen> verticillioides<pathogen> were cultured treated with EC
