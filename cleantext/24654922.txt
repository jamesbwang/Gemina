  This analysis examined changes in Karnofsky performance status ( KPS) as a surrogate for patient 's well-being during treatment with Descriptive analyses were performed for KPS at three time points ( 3 and 6 months after randomization and 1 month before disease progression) and for time to any KPS deterioration. Time to definitive KPS deterioration ( ≥ 10-point KPS decrease from baseline) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A larger decrease from baseline ( ≥ 20 points) was investigated as a sensitivity analysis. A Cox proportional hazards model analyzed the effect of baseline factors ( including treatment) potentially associated with time to definitive deterioration. The two treatment arms had generally comparable time to any KPS deterioration , similar KPS at 3 and 6 months after randomization and at 1 month before disease progression , and no significant difference in time to definitive deterioration. Baseline KPS , neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio , age , liver metastases , and region had a significant effect on time to definitive KPS deterioration , but treatment arm did not. The increased survival observed with
