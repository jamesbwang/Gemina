  The Ru complex ( RuII ( bda-κ-N2O2) ( N-NH2) 2) , 1 , ( bda2- = ( 2,2 '- bipyridine) -6,6 '- dicarboxylate; N-NH2 = 4- ( pyridin-4-yl) aniline) is used as a synthetic intermediate to prepare Ru-bda complexes that contain the NO + , acetonitrile ( MeCN) or H2O ligands at oxidation states II and III. Complex 1 reacts with excess NO + to form a Ru complex where the aryl amine ligands N-NH2 in 1 are transformed into diazonium salts ( N-N2 + = 4- ( pyridin-4-yl) benzenediazonium)) together with the formation of a new Ru-NO group at the equatorial zone , to generate ( RuII ( bda-κ-N2O) ( NO) ( N-N2) 2) 3 + , 23 +. Similarly , complex 1 can also react with a coordinating solvent , such as MeCN , at room temperature leading to complex ( RuII ( bda-κ-N2O) ( MeCN) ( N-NH2) 2) , 3. Finally in acidic aqueous solutions solvent water coordinates the Ru center forming ( ( RuII ( bda-κ- ( NO) 3) ( H2O) ( N-NH3) 2) ( H2O) n) 2 + , 42 + , that is strongly hydrogen bonded with additional water molecules at the second coordination sphere. We have additionally characterized the one electron oxidized complex ( ( RuIII ( bda-κ- ( NO) 3.5) ( H2O) ( N-NH3) 2) ( H2O) n) 3 + , 53 +. The coordination mode of the complexes has been studied both in the solid state and in solution through single-crystal XRD , X-ray absorption spectroscopy , variable-temperature NMR and DFT calculations. While the κ-N2O is the main coordination mode for 23 + and 3 , an equilibrium that involves isomers with κ-N2O and κ-NO2 coordination modes and neighboring hydrogen bonded water molecules is observed for 42 + and 53 +.
