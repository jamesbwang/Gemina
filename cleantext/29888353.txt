  Capillarity is an extremely common physical-chemical phenomenon related to wettability in nature , which has wide theoretical and practical interest. Herein , we reported a facile sensing device based on capillary force change in a vertical capillary tube. In this height-based capillary sensor ( HCS) , the inner surface of the capillary tube was modified with a layer of molecules with wetting responsibility based on the well-known simple surface chemistry. With targets in different concentrations , the wettability of the surface modified with responsive molecules would produce different changes. The responsive surfaces would change the capillary force of the vertical capillary tube , and result in different column heights. Like a thermometer , H
