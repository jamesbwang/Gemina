  Myotonic dystrophy type 1 ( DM1) and 2 ( DM2) are autosomal dominant degenerative neuromuscular disorders characterized by progressive skeletal muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom> , atrophy , and myotonia with progeroid features. Although both DM1 and DM2 are characterized by skeletal muscle<symptom> dysfunction<symptom> and also share other clinical features , the diseases differ in the muscle groups that are affected. In DM1 , distal muscles are mainly affected , whereas in DM2 problems are mostly found in proximal muscles. In addition , manifestation in DM1 is generally more severe , with possible congenital or childhood-onset of disease and prominent CNS involvement. DM1 and DM2 are caused by expansion of ( CTG • CAG) n and ( CCTG • CAGG) n repeats in the 3 ' non-coding region of
