  We present a focused review on the utility of transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS) for modulating memory , with a particular focus on multimodal approaches in which TMS is paired with neuroimaging methods ( electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI)) to manipulate and measure working memory processes. We contrast the utility of TMS for manipulating memory with other forms of noninvasive brain stimulation , as well as different forms of TMS including single-pulse , paired-pulse and repetitive TMS protocols. We discuss the potential for TMS to address fundamental cognitive neuroscience questions about the nature of memory processes and representations , while acknowledging the considerable variability of behavioral and neural outcomes in TMS studies. Also discussed are the limitations of this technology , current advancements that have helped to defray the impact of these limitations , and suggestions for future directions in research and methodology.
