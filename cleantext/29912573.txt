  The aim of this case-control study was to assess TIMP2 level in subjects with or without metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) and to associate levels with non-alcoholic fatty liver changes ( NAFLD). Thirty-three MetS subjects and 55 controls were recruited. Anthropometric data , lipid and glucose profile , TIMP2 and liver ultrasound was performed. High TIMP2 was seen in MetS group ( 145.28 ± 23.11 pg/ml) versus controls ( 19.06 ± 1.19 pg/ml; p < .001). Serum cholesterol , triglyceride , LDL-c and glucose levels were significantly higher in MetS subjects ( p < .05). MetS individuals ( 72.72 %) showed positive fatty liver changes versus 14.5 % controls. Elevated TIMP2 positively correlated with waist circumference , body fat , blood glucose and NAFLD. Furthermore , every unit rise in waist circumference and TIMP2 and a unit decrease in HDL were associated with higher odds of developing NAFLD ( p < .05). There may be concurrent relationship between TIMP2 and NAFLD in MetS that requires further evaluation to improve risk assessment and early diagnosis of MetS.
