  Impaired insulin sensitivity is a key abnormality underlying the development of type 2 diabetes. Measuring insulin sensitivity is therefore of importance in identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes and for the evaluation of diabetes-focused interventions. A number of measures have been proposed for this purpose. Among these the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp ( HEC) is considered the gold standard. However , as the HEC is a costly , time consuming and invasive method requiring trained staff , there is a need for simpler so called surrogate measures. A frequently used approach to evaluate surrogate measures is through correlation with the HEC. We discuss limitations with this method. We suggest other aspects to take into consideration , such as repeatability , reproducibility , systematic biases and discrimination ability. In addition , we focus on three frequently used surrogate measures. We argue that they are one-to-one transformations of each other , and therefore question the benefits of further comparison between them. They give the same results in all rank-based methods , for instance Spearman correlations , Mann-Whitney tests and receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) analysis. We suggest investigating further aspects than correlation alone when evaluating a surrogate measure of insulin sensitivity. We recommend choosing one of the three surrogate measures HOMA-IR , QUICKI and FIRI for analysis of a clinical study.
