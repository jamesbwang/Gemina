  To develop a simple and sensitive high performance liquid chromatographic method for simultaneous determination of catechin hydrate , epicatechin , epigallocatechin , epicatechin gallate , epigallocatechin gallate , dihydromyricetin , glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid in healthy food for anti-hangover and hepatoprotection , and compare with the capillary electrophoresis method established by our laboratory. The samples were ultrasonically extracted by using methanol-water ( 4 ∶ 1 , V/V) for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 10 000 r/min for 10 minutes. The supernatant was filtered and injected into the HPLC system and then separated on a C _ ( 18) column ( 5 μm × 250 mm × 4. 6 mm) at 30 ℃ with gradient elution at a flow rate of 0. 8mL/min. Catechins and dihydromyricetin were detected at the wavelength of 210 nm , glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid were detected at 250 nm. Under the optimal analytical conditions , the peak area of each analyte and its concentration had agood correlation within the linear range ( r ≥ 0. 9996). The limits of detection and quantification of the method were 0. 07-1. 25 μg/g ( S/N = 3) and 0. 22-4. 18 μg/g ( S/N = 10) , respectively. The intra-and inter-day relative standard deviations ( RSDs) of the mixed standard solution were 0. 26 % -1. 95 % and 1. 17 % -3. 89 % , respectively. The spiked recoveries of the analytes were 86. 15 % -98. 61 %. The established method is sensitive and reliable , and could be used for quality control of the healthy food for anti-hangover and hepatoprotection.
