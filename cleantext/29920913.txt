  To assess interindividual ( CV Six healthy Beagle dogs. Tissue factor ( TF)- activated TEG and adenosine diphosphate ( ADP) and arachidonic acid ( AA)- induced whole blood impedance platelet aggregometry were performed at 3 different time points ( days 1 , 4 , and 6). In addition , platelet count , hematocrit , and plasma fibrinogen concentrations were recorded each study day. Activated partial thromboplastin time , one-stage prothrombin time , antithrombin activity , and D-dimer concentrations were measured on the first day of the study. For TEG , the variables reaction time ( R) , clotting time ( K) , rate of clot formation ( Î±) , and maximum amplitude ( MA) were recorded. For platelet aggregometry , the areas under the curve for ADP ( AUC In healthy dogs , a subject-based reference interval for ADP- and AA-induced platelet aggregometry and the TEG variable MA provide a more sensitive method to detect changes. However , due to the high CV
