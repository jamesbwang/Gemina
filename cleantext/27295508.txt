  Previous studies have reported an association between eccentric strength ( ECC-STR) and change of direction ( COD) ability. Little is known about how ECC-STR facilitates COD maneuvers. The aim of this study was to examine the role of ECC-STR during a 180 ° COD task in 18 female soccer players. Each player performed six trials of a 180 ° COD task whereby three-dimensional motion data from 10 Qualisys Pro-Reflex infrared cameras ( 240 Hz) and ground reaction forces ( GRFs) from two AMTI force platforms ( 1200 Hz) were collected. Relative eccentric knee extensor ( ECC-EXT) and flexor ( ECC-FLEX) peak torque was collected from both limbs at 60 ° · s
