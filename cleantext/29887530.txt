  Intuition is the ability of experts to rapidly solve complicated problems that are highly difficult for the average person. We have measured the brain activity of professional and high-level amateur shogi players , and found that the basal ganglia plays an important role in the ability to rapidly determine , or intuit , the best next-move in a game situation. Additionally , we found that areas in the cingulate cortex are essential for making quick , intuitive , strategic decisions ( attack or defense) at any given board position. These findings suggest that experts , after long-term , focused training , can use these evolutionarily-old brain structures for `` intuitive '' decision-making , which , in non-experts , are only involved in primitive behaviors.
