  Predators induce defensive responses and fear behaviours in prey. The rat exposure test ( RET) is frequently used as an animal model of panic. Nitric oxide ( NO) which has been reported to be activated by the NMDA receptor , in turn mediates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII) signalling pathways in defensive responses. ACCN2 , the orthologous human gene of acid-sensing ion channel 1a ( ASIC1a) , is also associated with panic disorder; however , few studies have focused on the role of ASIC1a in the modulation of panic and calcium/CaMKII signalling by NO. In the present study , NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester ( L-NAME; non-selective NOS inhibitor) , S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D , L-penicillamine ( SNAP; NO donor) , and psalmotoxin ( PcTx-1; selective ASIC1a blocker) were administered to the dorsal periaqueductal grey ( dPAG) before the predator stimulus , and the roles of NO in the expression of ASIC1a , phosphorylation of CaMKIIα ( p-CaMKIIα) and expression of calmodulin ( CaM) were investigated. The effects of ASIC1a , p-CaMKIIα and CaM regulation were also examined. Our results showed that intra-dPAG infusion of L-NAME weakened panic-like behaviour and decreased ASIC1a , p-CaMKIIα and CaM expression levels , whereas intra-dPAG infusion of SNAP enhanced panic-like behaviour and increased ASIC1a , p-CaMKIIα and CaM levels. Intra-dPAG infusion of PcTx-1 also weakened panic-like behaviour and decreased p-CaMKIIα expression level. Taken together , these results indicate that NO and ASIC1a are involved in the modulation of RET-induced panic-like behaviour in the dPAG. NO regulates the calcium/CaMKII signalling pathways , and ASIC1a participates in this regulation.
