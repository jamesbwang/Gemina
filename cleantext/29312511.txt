  Long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) have been suggested to play important roles in the development of numerous kinds of human cancers. Increasing data has indicated that lncRNA RNCR3 has been involved in some human<disease> diseases<disease>. However , the exactly biological function and potential mechanisms of RNCR3 in the development of prostate cancer is still unclear. Here , our results confirmed that the RNCR3 expression was increased in prostate cancer compared to the corresponding adjacent normal prostate tissues. Moreover , our data showed that the increased expression of RNCR3 is significantly associated with tumor progression and poor survival of prostate cancer patients. Additionally , we found that RNCR3 knockdown could suppress the ability of proliferation , colony formation , and invasion of prostate cancer cells. Finally , we further confirmed that RNCR3 binds to miR-185-5p , which has been identified as a tumor suppressor in some human cancers , including prostate cancer. We also confirmed that the oncogenic function of RNCR3 in prostate cancer are partly mediated by negative regulation of miR-185-5p targeted BRD8 ISO2. Our data revealed that RNCR3 functions as an tumor-promoting lncRNA in prostate cancer and may serve as a novel important biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.
