  Aquatic herbicides are commonly used to control a wide variety of algae<pathogen> and plants , while having the potential to contaminate and affect non-target organisms. However , the impacts of low-level 2,4-dichlorophenoxyactic acid ( 2,4-D) herbicide exposure on larval fish are not well understood. We conducted a series of experiments to determine the effects of low concentrations ( 0.05 , 0.50 and 2.00 ppm) of two commercial amine salt herbicide formulations of 2,4-D ( Weedestroy ® AM40 ( WAM40) and DMA ® 4IVM ( DMA4)) and pure 2,4-D on the development and survival of fathead minnows ( Pimephales promelas) at various life-cycle stages. Larval survival ( 30 dph) was decreased following exposure of eggs and larvae to pure 2,4-D ( 0.50 ppm; p ≤ 0.001) , as well as to WAM40 ( 0.50 and 2.00 ppm; p ≤ 0.001 , p ≤ 0.001) and DMA4 ( 0.50 and 2.00 ppm p ≤ 0.001 , p ≤ 0.001). Present data also narrowed the critical window of exposure for effects on survival to the period between fertilization to 14 dph. Development was not negatively altered by any of the compounds tested , although the commercial formulations increased larval total length and mass at 2.00 ppm. Altogether , the results indicate that the use of 2,4-D herbicides for weed control in aquatic ecosystems at current recommended concentrations ( < 2 ppm whole lake; < 4 ppm spot treatment) could presents risk to fathead minnow larval survival.
