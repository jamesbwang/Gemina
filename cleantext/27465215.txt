  The engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation ( enChIP) technology enables purification of specific genomic regions interacting with their associated molecules. In enChIP , the locus to be purified is first tagged with engineered DNA-binding molecules. An example of such engineered DNA-binding molecules to tag the locus of interest is the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR) system , consisting of a catalytically-inactive form of Cas9 ( dCas9) and guide RNA ( gRNA). Subsequently , the tagged locus is subjected to affinity purification for identification of interacting molecules. In our previous studies , we developed enChIP systems for analysis of mammalian genome functions. Here , we developed an enChIP system to analyze bacterial genome functions. We generated a plasmid inducibly expressing Streptococcus<pathogen> pyogenes<pathogen> dCas9 fused to a 3xFLAG-tag ( 3xFLAG-dCas9) in bacteria. Inducible expression of 3xFLAG-dCas9 in Escherichia<pathogen> coli<pathogen> was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. We were able to purify specific genomic regions of E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> preserving their molecular interactions. The system is potentially useful for analysis of interactions between specific genomic regions and their associated molecules in bacterial cells to understand genome functions such as transcription , DNA repair , and DNA recombination.
