  Fertilizer response modelling is an important technical approach to realize metrological fertilization on rice. With the goal of solving the problems of a low success rate of a ternary quadratic polynomial model ( TPFM) and to expand the model 's applicability , this paper established a ternary non-structural fertilizer response model ( TNFM) based on the experimental results from N , P and K fertilized rice fields. Our research results showed that the TNFM significantly improved the modelling success rate by addressing problems arising from setting the bias and multicollinearity in a TPFM. The results from 88 rice field trials in China indicated that the proportion of typical TNFMs that satisfy the general fertilizer response law of plant nutrition was 40.9 % , while the analogous proportion of TPFMs was only 26.1 %. The recommended fertilization showed a significant positive linear correlation between the two models , and the parameters N
