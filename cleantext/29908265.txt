  Retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE) is a cell monolayer essential for photoreceptor function and forming the blood-retinal barrier. RPE and retinal neurons share the same origin and a polarized cytoarchitecture. Several factors determine the phagocytosis and permeability of RPE , influencing photoreceptor renewal and drug delivery , efficacy and toxicity. Adult human RPE expresses neuronal markers in vitro , indicating a potential transdifferentiation. Degeneration of the RPE leads to death of photoreceptors and retinal neurons , resulting in the vision loss<symptom> of retinopathy. Here , we suggest tools for cell engineering to discover new ways for activating the endogenous regeneration of barrier functions and/or of the retinal precursors in RPE cells.
