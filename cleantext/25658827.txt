  The licensing of talimogene laherparepvec ( T-Vec) represented a landmark moment for oncolytic virotherapy , since it provided unequivocal evidence for the long-touted potential of genetically modified replicating viruses as anti-cancer agents. Whilst T-Vec is promising as a locally delivered virotherapy , especially in combination with immune-checkpoint inhibitors , the quest continues for a virus capable of specific tumour cell killing via systemic administration. One candidate is oncolytic adenovirus<pathogen> ( Ad); it & rsquo; s double stranded DNA genome is easily manipulated and a wide range of strategies and technologies have been employed to empower the vector with improved pharmacokinetics and tumour targeting ability. As well characterised clinical and experimental agents , we have detailed knowledge of adenoviruses & rsquo; mechanisms of pathogenicity , supported by detailed virological studies and in vivo interactions. In this review we highlight the strides made in the engineering of bespoke adenoviral vectors to specifically infect , replicate within , and destroy tumour cells. We discuss how mutations in genes regulating adenoviral replication after cell entry can be used to restrict replication to the tumour , and summarise how detailed knowledge of viral capsid interactions enable rational modification to eliminate native tropisms , and simultaneously promote active uptake by cancerous tissues. We argue that these designer-viruses , exploiting the viruses natural mechanisms and regulated at every level of replication , represent the ideal platforms for local overexpression of therapeutic transgenes such as immunomodulatory agents. Where T-Vec has paved the way , Ad-based vectors now follow. The era of designer oncolytic virotherapies looks decidedly as though it will soon become a reality.
