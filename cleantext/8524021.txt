  This study aims to explore the intrinsic patterns of spontaneous activity of bipolar depression<symptom> ( BD) patients by analyzing the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation ( fALFF) that help differentiate BD from unipolar depressive disorder ( UD). Twenty eight patients with BD , 47 patients with UD and 29 healthy controls were enrolled to receive the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rs-fMRI) scans. The group differences of fALFF values were calculated among three groups. In addition , the correlations between the clinical variables and mfALFF values were estimated. The brain regions with activation discrepancies among three groups are located in precuneus , the left middle temporal gyrus ( MTG) and left inferior parietal lobe ( IPL) and lingual gyrus. Compared with HC group , BD group shows decreased fALFF in precuneus , the left IPL and increased fALFF in lingual gyrus remarkably; UD group shows significantly decreased fALFF in precuneus , the left MTG and the left IPL. On the contrast of patients with UD , patients with BD have significantly increased fALFF value in the left precuneus , the left MGT and lingual gyrus. Furthermore , a negative correlation is found between the mfALFF values in precuneus and the scores of cognitive impairment factor in the UD group. The similar pattern of intrinsic activity in PCC suggests depressive state-dependent change. The aberrant patterns of intrinsic activity in precuneus , the IPL and lingual gyrus might be provide quantitative nodes that help to conduct further study for better distinguishing between BD and UD.
