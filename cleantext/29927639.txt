  To investigate whether the mammographic features were different between breast cancer HER2-enriched molecular subtype and non-HER2-enriched molecular subtype. 283 microcalcification-associated breast cancers were identified ( HER2-enriched: n = 57; non-HER2-enriched: n = 226). Mammographic tumor mass and calcification features in relation to HER2 molecular subtype were analyzed. On univariate analysis , HER2-enriched molecular subtype rates were significantly higher ( a) in tumor size < = 2 cm 33 of 57 ( 57.9 %)) than in tumor size > 2 cm lesions<symptom> ( 22 of 226 ( 9.7 %)) ( p = 0.007) , ( b) in non-spiculated mass 39 of 57 ( 68.4 %)) than in spiculated mass lesions<symptom> ( 18 of 226 ( 7.9 %)) ( p = 0.034) ， ( c) in calcifications extent > 2 cm ( 41of 57 ( 71.9 %)) lesions<symptom> than in calcifications extent < = 2 cm lesions<symptom> ( 16 of 226 ( 7.1 %)) ( p < 0.001) and ( d) in calcification density ＞ 20/cm Our study presents a prediction model that incorporates the mammographic features of tumor size , non-spiculated mass and calcification extent , which can potentially be used to preoperative predict breast cancer HER2-enriched subtype. Advancesinknowledge: Mammographic features can noninvasively visualize breast tumor phenotype characteristics.
