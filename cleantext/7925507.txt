  Cardiovascular diseases , including acute myocardial infarction ( AMI) , are leading causes of death among the Japanese , who have the longest life expectancy in the world. Over the past 50 years in Japan , the percentage of elderly individuals has increased 4-fold , from 5.7 % in 1960 to 23.1 % in 2010. To explore medical practices and emergency care for AMI in this aging society , the Japan Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry ( JAMIR) was established as a nationwide real-world database. JAMIR conducted retrospective analysis of 20,462 AMI patients ( mean age , 68.8 ± 13.3 years; 15,281 men ( 74.7 %)) hospitalized between January 2011 and December 2013. The rates of ambulance use and emergency PCI were 78.9 % and 87.9 % , respectively. The median door-to-balloon time was 80 min ( interquartile range , 53-143 min). Overall in-hospital mortality was 8.3 % , including 6.6 % due to cardiac death. JAMIR included 4837 patients aged ≥ 80 years ( 23.6 %). In this age group , patients who underwent PCI ( 79.9 %) had significantly lower in-hospital mortality than those who did not ( 11.1 % vs. 36.9 % , The large JAMIR database , with 24 % of AMI patients aged ≥ 80 years , could provide useful information about medical care in an aging society. The reasonable in-hospital outcomes observed may justify consideration of PCI for patients with AMI aged ≥ 80 years.
