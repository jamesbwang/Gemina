  To study the intestinal absorption characteristics of drug 's nanocrystalline self-stabilizing Pickering emulsion ( NSSPE) in situ in rats. Rat single-pass intestinal perfusion model was established , and high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) was used to detect the concentration of puerarin in rat intestinal perfusion solution , assay the absorption rate constant ( Ka) and the intestinal apparent permeability coefficient ( Papp) of NSSPE in duodenum , jejunum<symptom> , ileum , and colon , which were compared with those of raw material , nanocrystal and normal emulsion , respectively. For NSSPE , the Ka and Papp values were in the following order: duodenum > jejunum<symptom> > ileum (
