  The re-discovery of arenediazonium salts as stable and easily accessible electrophiles for radical aromatic substitutions initiated by single-electron transfer has led to the development of numerous protocols. The diverse set of methods involving metal-mediated , transition metal-catalyzed , photoredox-catalytic and electrochemical electron-transfer mechanisms has recently been complemented by reactions that operate under the mild conditions of very weak inorganic bases. This method provides great advantages with regard to operational simplicity , price , hazard potential , and scalability. The scope of weak base-mediated radical aromatic substitutions has been greatly expanded to include various C-C and C-heteroatom bond forming reactions , cyclizations and rearrangements , and even reactions that preserve the reduction-labile dinitrogen functionality within the product structure. The recent reports of highly fruitful synthetic applications have impressively documented that non-hazardous , inexpensive , and easily accessible inorganic bases can mimic the reducing ability of metal salts , complex reductants , or photo/electrochemical setups. This review covers a concise summary of the most important development in the field and provides detailed analyses of reaction scopes and mechanisms.
