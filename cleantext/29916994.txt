  Observational studies have indicated that high levels of serum uric acid are associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study is to investigate the association of uric acid with individual cardiometabolic risk factors , as well as their degree of clustering , in overweight and moderate obese youth. Three hundred and thirty-three Caucasians of both sexes ( 149 women) , from 5-18 years of age from those who underwent an assessment of overweight/obesity. Anthropometric parameters , office and 24-h blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> measurements and metabolic profile , including HDL-cholesterol , triglycerides , insulin , HOMA index and uric acid were assessed. Uric acid was significantly higher in boys than in girls. A positive significant association between uric acid , and office , daytime and night-time SBP , insulin and triglycerides was observed. When boys and girls were grouped by sex-specific uric acid tertiles , a progressive increment was observed in BMI , BMI z-score and waist circumference as well as fasting insulin and HOMA index. In boys , this was also present in office and ambulatory SBP. Likewise , the number of abnormal metabolic risk factors also increases with the uric acid values and the higher the number of metabolic components the higher the uric acid values. Moreover , in a multiple regression analysis , uric acid was significantly related with male sex , waist circumference , both office and night-time SBP and birth weight. The present study found a positive association between uric acid and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , insulin and triglycerides. As uric acid levels increase there is a relevant clustering of metabolic risk factors , whereas elevated blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> is the risk factor less frequently present. Further studies need to assess the mechanistic link between uric acid and the cardiometabolic risk factors.
