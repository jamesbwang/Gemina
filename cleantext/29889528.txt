  Three structurally very different antifreeze proteins ( AFPs) are studied , addressing the question as to what extent the hypothesized preordering-binding mechanism is still relevant in the second solvation layer of the protein and beyond. Assuming a two-state model of water , the solvation layers are analyzed with the help of molecular dynamics simulations together with a Markov state model , which investigates the local tedrahedrality of the water hydrogen-bond network around a given water molecule. It has been shown previously that this analysis can discriminate the high-entropy , high-density state of the liquid ( HDL) from its more structured low-density state ( LDL). All investigated proteins , regardless of whether they are an AFP or not , have a tendency to increase the amount of HDL in their second solvation layer. The ice binding site ( IBS) of the antifreeze proteins counteracts that trend , with either a hole in the HDL layer or a true excess of LDL. The results correlate to a certain extent with recent experiments , which have observed ice-like vibrational ( VSFG) spectra for the water atop the IBS of only a subset of antifreeze proteins. It is concluded that the preordering-binding mechanism indeed seems to play a role but is only part of the overall picture.
