  BACKGROUND The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the frequency of admissions , reason for admissions , and test socket satisfaction in patients who received a lower-limb prosthesis with or without a test socket in our unit. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 88 patients ( 54 men , 34 women) were included in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups: the group with test socket ( Group I , 44 patients) and the group without test socket ( Group II , 44 patients). Variables related to the functional status , frequency of complaints , and test socket satisfaction were investigated in the 2 groups. The Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scales ( TAPES) and Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory ( BDI) were used to assess the level of patient satisfaction with their prosthesis. The VAS ( Visual Analogue Scale) was used to assess pain at rest and during walking. RESULTS We found that the TAPES values were more significant in Group 1 in both transtibial and transfemoral amputations ( P < 0.05). However , prosthesis delivery time was more significant in Group 2 in both transtibial and transfemoral amputations ( P < 0.001) whereas the frequency of admissions within 3 months was more significant in Group 1 in both transtibial and transfemoral amputations ( P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of other parameters ( P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Although the use of a test socket increases the cost of prosthesis units , we showed that patients with transtibial and transfemoral amputations have fewer complaints related to prosthesis increases patient functionality , and that it reduces pain and increases patient satisfaction with the prosthesis.
