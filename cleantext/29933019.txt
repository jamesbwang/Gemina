  Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that occurs mainly in children and adolescents. Because Wnt signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma , we have investigated the circulating and local levels of the Wnt antagonist protein , Secreted Frizzled Related Protein ( sFRP) 3 , in osteosarcoma patients. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) analysis of 67 osteosarcoma and age-matched non-diseased control sera showed that sFPR3 protein levels were significantly lower in osteosarcoma than in normal. Analysis of tumor and adjacent normal tissues ( 9 pairs) from osteosarcoma patients showed a decrease in sFRP3 expression in 5 out of 9 tumor samples compared to normal tissues. Furthermore , immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarray revealed a significant decrease in sFRP3 levels in tumor compared to normal bone. RNA sequencing analysis in osteosarcoma cells shows suppression of sFRP3 and concomitant expression of multiple Wnt family members mediating canonical or non-canonical Wnt signaling. Taken together , our findings show that the systemic and local levels of sFRP3 protein are downregulated in osteosarcoma and sFRP3 levels could be explored further in the diagnosis and the care of osteosarcoma patients.
