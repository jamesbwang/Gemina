  To prevent the risk of iatrogenic instability after surgery for upper lumbar disc herniation , we adapted a microsurgical translaminar approach ( key-hole laminotomy) which allows less destructive laminotomy. We present a microsurgical translaminar approach , and compare the results of the translaminar and interlaminar approaches. A total of 48 patients who underwent single level discectomy in the upper lumbar spine ( L1-2 or L2-3) were enrolled. These patients were allocated to two groups , that is , to a translaminar group ( n = 20) or to an interlaminar group ( n = 28). Mean patient age was 57.04 ± 12.77 years and median follow-up duration was 3.5 years ( range , 1.0-7.0 years). A retrospective review of clinical and radiological data was conducted. Baseline characteristics , including age , sex , surgical level , and preoperative symptoms , were non-significantly different. At 1-year after surgery , improvement in leg<symptom> pain<symptom> as determined by a visual analog scale ( VAS) was non-significantly different. However , improvement in VAS for back pain was significantly greater in the translaminar group than interlaminar group ( mean 4.00 ± 1.56 versus 2.45 ± 2.01 , p < 0.001). Surgical outcome was not different between two groups. Mean decrease in disc height at the operated level was not significantly different between the two groups. However , mean increase in segmental range of motion at surgical levels was significantly greater in the interlamninar group ( -3.38 ± 4.03 ° versus 1.10 ± 3.03 ° , p = 0.010) , and mean recovery of total lumbar lordosis was significantly greater in the translaminar group ( 9.80 ± 5.96 ° versus 0.43 ± 8.45 ° , p = 0.021). The described translaminar approach provides a safe and effective alternative to the classic interlaminar approach for upper LDH.
