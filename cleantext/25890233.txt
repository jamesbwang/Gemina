  Long-lasting insecticidal nets ( LLINs) are a key tool for malaria<disease> prevention and control. Currently , the recommended serviceable life of an LLIN is 3 years under field conditions. However , field studies show considerable variation in LLIN lifespan , from less than 2 years to more than 4 years. This study aimed to determine the attrition , physical integrity , functional survival , and bio-efficacy of LLINs under field conditions in south-central Ethiopia. In October 2014 , 7740 LLINs ( PermaNet The overall attrition of LLINs was 96 % ( n = 993) during the study period. The nets ' attrition was mainly due to disposal ( 64.2 %; n = 638). The proportion of LLINs with a hole size 0.5 cm or larger was 79.5 % after 24 months. The use of the net on the previous night and having a clean net were associated with a good physical integrity. However , living in a household more than 1 km away from the mosquitoes ' breeding site was associated with poor physical integrity. By the 24th month , only 4 % of the nets met the criteria for functional survival. The median functional survival time of the nets was 12 months. A longer functional survival was associated with having a clean net , and shorter survival was associated with living in a household more than 1 km away from the mosquitoes ' breeding site. The PermaNet The study showed that the median serviceable life of LLINs is only 12 months. However , the bio-efficacy of the LLINs is acceptable for at least 24 months. Therefore , stronger and more efficient LLINs need to be developed for conditions similar to those studied here.
