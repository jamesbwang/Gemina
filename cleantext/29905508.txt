  OBJECTIVE There are currently no reliable means to predict the wide variability in behavior of clival chordoma so as to guide clinical decision-making and patient education. Furthermore , there is no method of predicting a tumor 's response to radiation therapy. METHODS A molecular prognostication panel , consisting of fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) of the chromosomal loci 1p36 and 9p21 , as well as immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 , was prospectively evaluated in 105 clival chordoma samples from November 2007 to April 2016. The results were correlated with overall progression-free survival after surgery ( PFSS) , as well as progression-free survival after radiotherapy ( PFSR). RESULTS Although Ki-67 and the percentages of tumor cells with 1q25 hyperploidy , 1p36 deletions , and homozygous 9p21 deletions were all found to be predictive of PFSS and PFSR in univariate analyses , only 1p36 deletions and homozygous 9p21 deletions were shown to be independently predictive in a multivariate analysis. Using a prognostication calculator formulated by a separate multivariate Cox model , two 1p36 deletion strata ( 0 % -15 % and > 15 % deleted tumor cells) and three 9p21 homozygous deletion strata ( 0 % -3 % , 4 % -24 % , and â‰¥ 25 % deleted tumor cells) accounted for a range of cumulative hazard ratios of 1 to 56.1 for PFSS and 1 to 75.6 for PFSR. CONCLUSIONS Homozygous 9p21 deletions and 1p36 deletions are independent prognostic factors in clival chordoma and can account for a wide spectrum of overall PFSS and PFSR. This panel can be used to guide management after resection of clival chordomas.
