  Glycomics continues to be a highly dynamic and interesting research area due to the need to comprehensively understand the biological attributes of glycosylation in many important biological functions such as the immune response , cell development , cell differentiation/adhesion , and host-pathogen interactions. Although matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization ( MALDI) mass spectrometry ( MS) has proven to be suitable for glycomic profiling studies , there is a need for improved sensitivity in the detection of native glycans , which ionize inefficiently. In this study , we investigated the efficiencies of graphene nanosheets ( GNs) and carbon nanoparticles ( CNPs) as MALDI matrices and co-matrices in glycan profiling. Our results indicated an enhancement of signal intensity by several orders of magnitude upon using GNs and CNPs in MALDI analysis of N-glycans derived from a variety of biological samples. Interestingly , increasing the amounts of CNPs and GNs improved not only the signal intensities but also prompted in-source decay ( ISD) fragmentations , which produced extensive glycosidic and cross-ring cleavages. Our results indicated that the extent of ISD fragmentation could be modulated by CNP and GN concentrations , to obtain MS
