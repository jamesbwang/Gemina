  Supramolecular interactions , such as those observed between antibodies and antigens , have been employed in developing analytical methods for several decades. One major area of interest concerns cancer research , where intricate supramolecular designs have emerged to tackle difficult analytes in complex tumor systems. Our increasing knowledge toward supramolecular systems have elicited profound interest in creating more efficient analytical approaches , evidenced by the ever-growing body of literature in the field. Some of the novel tools have indeed facilitated our understanding of cancer biology , through providing previously inaccessible information. In this review , we describe common strategies of developing supramolecular analytical methods and their implementations in cancer research. We provide an overview for each of the approaches and discuss representative examples in recent literature.
