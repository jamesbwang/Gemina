  Several studies have shown that Executive Functioning ( EF) is a unique predictor of mathematics performance. However , whether or not children with mathematics difficulties ( MD) experience deficits in EF remains unclear. Thus , the purpose of this study was to examine if Chinese children with MD experience deficits in EF. We assessed 23 children with MD ( 9 girls , mean age = 10.40 years) , 30 children with reading difficulties and MD ( RDMD; 12 girls , mean age = 10.82 years) , and 31 typically-developing ( TD) peers ( 16 girls , mean age = 10.41 years) on measures of inhibition ( Color-Word Stroop , Inhibition) , shifting of attention ( Planned Connections , Rapid Alternating Stimuli) , working memory ( Digit Span Backwards , Listening Span) , processing speed ( Visual Matching , Planned Search) , reading ( Character Recognition , Sentence Verification) , and mathematics ( Addition and Subtraction Fluency , Math Standard Achievement Test). The results of MANOVA analyses showed first that the performance of the MD children in all EF tasks was worse than their TD peers. Second , with the exception of the shifting tasks in which the MD children performed better than the RDMD children , the performance of the two groups was similar in all measures of working memory and inhibition. Finally , covarying for the effects of processing speed eliminated almost all differences between the TD and MD groups ( the only exception was Listening Span) as well as the differences between the MD and RDMD groups in shifting of attention. Taken together , our findings suggest that although Chinese children with MD ( with or without comorbid reading difficulties) experience significant deficits in all EF skills , most of their deficits can be accounted by lower-level deficits in processing speed.
