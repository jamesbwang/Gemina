  Antibodies are essential biochemical reagents for detecting protein post-translational modifications ( PTMs) in complex samples. However , recent efforts in developing PTM-targeting antibodies have reported frequent non-specific binding and limited affinity of such antibodies. To address these challenges , we investigated whether directed evolution could be applied to improve the affinity of a high-specificity antibody targeting phospho-threonine 231 ( pT231) of the human microtubule-associated protein tau. On the basis of existing structural information , we hypothesized that improving antibody affinity may come at the cost of loss in specificity. To test this hypothesis , we developed a novel approach using yeast surface display to quantify the specificity of PTM-targeting antibodies. When we affinity-matured the single-chain variable antibody fragment through directed evolution , we found that its affinity can be improved > 20-fold over that of the wild-type antibody , reaching a picomolar range. We also discovered that most of the high-affinity variants exhibit cross-reactivity towards the non-phosphorylated target site , but not to the phosphorylation site with a scrambled sequence. However , systematic quantification of the specificity revealed that such a tradeoff between the affinity and specificity did not apply to all variants and led to the identification of a picomolar-affinity variant that has a matching high specificity of the original phospho-tau antibody. In cell- and tissue-imaging experiments , the high-affinity variant gave significantly improved signal intensity while having no detectable nonspecific binding. These results demonstrate that directed evolution is a viable approach for obtaining high-affinity PTM-specific antibodies , and highlight the importance of assessing the specificity in the antibody engineering process.
