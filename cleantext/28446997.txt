  Endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD) is an effective treatment modality for superficial squamous esophageal neoplasia ( SSEN). However , submucosal fibrosis<disease> is an important obstacle to successful ESD. The aim of this study was to determine the ESD outcome in relationship to the degree of submucosal fibrosis<disease> of SSEN and to identify factors for predicting submucosal fibrosis<disease>. We retrospectively analyzed endoscopic and pathologic factors related to submucosal fibrosis<disease> in 41 patients with SSEN who underwent ESD. Also , en bloc resection rate , complication rate , and procedure time according to the degree of submucosal fibrosis<disease> were evaluated. Masson 's trichrome staining was used to evaluate histologic submucosal fibrosis<disease>. A depressed type tumor ( vs. nondepressed type tumor , P = 0.002) , length of tumor greater than 20 mm ( vs. length of tumor â‰¤ 20 mm , P = 0.036) , and delayed ESD after initial biopsy ( vs. immediate ESD after initial biopsy , P = 0.005) were independent factors predictive of submucosal fibrosis<disease>. The severity of submucosal fibrosis<disease> was significantly associated with a higher complication rate such as bleeding and perforation. Also , as the severity of the submucosal fibrosis<disease> increased , the amount of time required for the ESD procedure increased. Length of tumor greater than 20 mm and endoscopic depressed type are endoscopic predictive factors of submucosal fibrosis<disease> in SSEN. Moreover , to avoid submucosal fibrosis<disease> , ESD should be attempted immediately after biopsy for the diagnosis of SSEN.
