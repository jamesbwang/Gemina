  Impingement is a risk factor for instability and prosthetic failure following total hip arthroplasty ( THA). If the periacetabular osteophytes are not removed at surgery , impingement could occur between the osteophytes and the femoral stem following THA. However , excessive removal of the osteophytes could lead to bleeding from the bone. The aim of our study , therefore , was to locate the site of the impingement and to determine the width of tolerable osteophytes , which does not induce impingement during activities of daily living ( ADL) , using a three-dimensional simulation. On 35 hip models , virtual THA was performed. The acetabular cups were positioned at 45 ° abduction and 20 ° anteversion , and the anteversion of femoral stems was 15 °. Circular osteophytes with a 30-mm rim were built around the acetabular cup. Fourteen ADL motions were simulated , and the osteophytes were removed until there was no impingement. A clock face was used to map the location and the width of tolerable osteophytes. The impingement mainly occurred in antero-superior and posterior portions around the acetabular cup. Only 4.2-6.2-mm osteophytes were tolerable at the antero-superior portion ( 12-3 o'clock) and 6.3-7.2-mm osteophytes at the posterior portion ( 8-10 o'clock) following a total hip arthroplasty. In antero-inferior and postero-superior portions , over-20-mm osteophytes did not induce any impingement. Osteophytes in the antero-superior and posterior portion of the acetabulum should be excised during a THA to avoid impingement of the femur-stem construct on the acetabular osteophytes during ADLs.
