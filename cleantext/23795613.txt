  With the rise in diabetes mellitus cases worldwide and lack of patient adherence to glycemia management using injectable insulin , there is an urgent need for the development of efficient oral insulin formulations. However , the gastrointestinal tract presents a formidable barrier to oral delivery of biologics. Here we report the development of a highly effective oral insulin formulation using choline and geranate ( CAGE) ionic liquid. CAGE significantly enhanced paracellular transport of insulin , while protecting it from enzymatic degradation and by interacting with the mucus layer resulting in its thinning. In vivo , insulin-CAGE demonstrated exceptional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcome after jejunal administration in rats. Low insulin doses ( 3-10 U/kg) brought about a significant decrease in blood glucose levels , which were sustained for longer periods ( up to 12 hours) , unlike s.c. injected insulin. When 10 U/kg insulin-CAGE was orally delivered in enterically coated capsules using an oral gavage , a sustained decrease in blood glucose of up to 45 % was observed. The formulation exhibited high biocompatibility and was stable for 2 months at room temperature and for at least 4 months under refrigeration. Taken together , the results indicate that CAGE is a promising oral delivery vehicle and should be further explored for oral delivery of insulin and other biologics that are currently marketed as injectables.
