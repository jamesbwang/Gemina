  We present a case of myositis and possible overlapping neuromuscular junction disorder following treatment with nivolumab for recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC). We report a 75-year-old man with recurrent stage IVA , T1N2cM0 oral cavity HNSCC treated with weight-dosed nivolumab who presented three weeks later with severe<symptom> fatigue<symptom> , generalized weakness<symptom> , and bilateral ptosis<symptom>. Evaluation demonstrated elevated creatine kinase and myopathic motor units on electromyography , supporting a diagnosis of an underlying muscle disease. Elevated serum acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies raised the possibility of concurrent myasthenia gravis. He received corticosteroids and plasmapheresis without improvement in muscle<symptom> weakness<symptom>. His course was complicated by bacteremia , cardiac arrest , and concerns for recurrent malignancy. Following a two-month hospital stay , he was made comfort care and died. With increasing usage of checkpoint inhibitors in HNSCC , clinicians must be aware of and vigilant for associated rare but serious adverse events.
