  The deep inferior epigastric perforator ( DIEP) flap is widely regarded as the Gold Standard in autologous breast reconstruction. Although drain-free abdominoplasty is performed in many centres , there is a paucity of evidence comparing outcomes when applied to DIEP breast reconstruction. A retrospective review of patients who underwent DIEP breast reconstruction without abdominal drain insertion at Royal Free Hospital between Jan 2012-Nov 2016 was undertaken. Results were compared to previously published data from our centre on patients undergoing DIEP breast reconstruction with abdominal drains between Jan 2011-Jul 2012. Thirty-five patients underwent abdominal drain-free reconstruction ( GroupA). Of 74 patients who previously underwent reconstruction with abdominal drains , 33 patients underwent drain removal by postoperative day ( POD) 3 regardless of output ( GroupB) and 41 underwent drain removal after POD3 following instructions on drainage volume/24 h ( GroupC). There was no significant difference in the length of stay between patients in Group A and B ( 3.6 vs. 3.9 days; p = 0.204). Length of stay in Group C was significantly higher than Group A and B ( p = 0.001 , p = 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in total ( 11.43 % vs. 12.12 % vs 17.07 % , p = 0.780) or specific complications: Seroma: 2.86 % vs. 0 % vs. 4.88 % ( p = 0.774); Wound dehiscence: 8.57 % vs. 9.09 % vs. 4.88 % ( p = 0.728); Haematoma: 0 % vs. 3.00 % vs. 7.32 % ( p = 0.316) between Groups A , B and C , respectively. Our data suggests that drain-free abdominal closure in DIEP reconstruction can be safely achieved without increased postoperative complications. These conclusions support existing evidence on the use of a drain-free approach in cosmetic abdominoplasty.
