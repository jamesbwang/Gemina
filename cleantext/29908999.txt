  The roles of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1) gene polymorphisms in atherosclerotic diseases were intensively analyzed , but the results of these studies were inconsistent. Therefore , we performed this study to better assess the relationship between PAI-1 genetic variations and atherosclerosis. Eligible studies were searched in PubMed , Medline , Embase and Web of Science. Odds ratios ( ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) were used to assess relationship between PAI-1 polymorphisms and atherosclerotic diseases. Ninety-nine studies involving 62,739 cases and 87,169 controls were finally included. Significant associations with the risk of atherosclerosis were detected for the rs2227631 polymorphism in the dominant model ( 95 % CI 0.84-1.00) , for the rs1799889 polymorphism in the dominant ( 95 % CI 1.01-1.18) , recessive ( 95 % CI 0.90-0.98) and allele ( 95 % CI 1.01-1.12) models. Further subgroup analyses based on type of disease and ethnicity of participants suggested that the rs2227631 polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of coronary artery disease in the dominant ( 95 % CI 0.71-0.94) and allele ( 95 % CI 0.80-0.94) models , whereas the rs1799889 polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of myocardial infarction ( dominant model: 95 % CI 1.09-1.57; recessive model: 95 % CI 0.71-0.96; allele model: 95 % CI 1.05-1.28) and cerebral infarction ( dominant model: 95 % CI 1.68-3.51; additive model: 95 % CI 0.39-0.77; allele model: 95 % CI 1.23-2.00). Moreover , the rs1799889 polymorphism was also significantly correlated with the risk of atherosclerosis in both Asians ( dominant model: 95 % CI 1.10-1.83; allele model: 95 % CI 1.03-1.41) and Caucasians ( recessive model: 95 % CI 0.87-0.97; allele model: 95 % CI 1.01-1.12). In conclusion , our findings indicate that PAI-1 rs2227631 and rs1799889 polymorphisms may serve as genetic biomarkers of atherosclerotic diseases.
