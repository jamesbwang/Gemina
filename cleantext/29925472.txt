  Chronic kidney disease ( CKD) deteriorates the prognosis of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI). Because coronary artery disease ( CAD) is the major cause of death in CKD patients , cardiovascular risk reduction has been clinically important in CKD. We hypothesized intensive lipid-lowering with statin/ezetimibe attenuated coronary atherosclerotic development even in patients with CKD. In the prospective , randomized , controlled , multicenter PRECISE-IVUS trial , 246 patients undergoing intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS)- guided PCI were randomly assigned to receive atorvastatin/ezetimibe combination or atorvastatin alone ( the dosage of atorvastatin was up-titrated to achieve the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 70 mg/dL). Serial volumetric IVUS findings obtained at baseline and 9-12 month follow-up to quantify the coronary plaque response in 202 patients were compared stratified by the presence or absence of CKD. CKD was observed in 52 patients ( 26 %) among 202 enrolled patients. Compared with the non-CKD group , the CKD group was significantly older ( 71.5 ± 8.6 years vs. 64.4 ± 9.6 years , P < 0.001) with similar prevalence of comorbid coronary risk factors and lipid profiles. Similar to the non-CKD group ( -1.4 ( -2.8 to -0.1) % vs. -0.2 ( -1.7 to 1.0) % , P = 0.002) , the atorvastatin/ezetimibe combination significantly reduced ∆ PAV compared with atorvastatin alone even in the CKD group ( -2.6 ( -5.6 to -0.4) % vs. -0.9 ( -2.4 to 0.2) % , P = 0.04). As with non-CKD , intensive lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin/ezetimibe demonstrated stronger coronary plaque regression effect even in patients with CKD compared with atorvastatin monotherapy.
