  Oak wilt is a lethal disease caused by the invasive fungus Bretziella fagacearum , which is transmitted belowground via root grafts and aboveground by sap beetles ( Nitidulidae). Attempts to limit spread and impact of B. fagacearum emphasize limiting harvesting and pruning to periods of vector inactivity. However , there is limited information on sap beetle activity periods , responses to temperature , and phoresy frequencies of fungi<pathogen> We sampled two major vectors in Wisconsin , Colopterus truncatus and Carpophilus sayi , for 2 yr to quantify their seasonal and geographic abundances. Trapping was performed in 12 oak stands , and beetles were assayed for B. fagacearum. C. truncatus was captured from March until November , peaking during April and May. C. sayi was captured from April until November , peaking in May and July. Relative abundances ( N = 15,980) were 59.3 % C. truncatus and 40.7 % C. sayi. C. sayi was more abundant in southern Wisconsin , whereas C. truncatus was more evenly distributed. Both species were present at asymptomatic sites. All sites with oak wilt centers yielded beetles with viable fungal propagules , with the frequency of association ranging from 1 to 50 %. Sites asymptomatic for oak wilt contained both beetle species , but no vector-borne viable pathogen. Degree-day models were constructed to improve the generality of these results and estimate cumulative emergences across a latitudinal range over the previous 10-yr means and extremes. Because activity by C. truncatus and C. sayi spans the seasonal activities of oak wilt vectors , these results can help guide oak management practices.
