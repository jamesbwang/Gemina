  Healthy ageing has been unattainable for many of Australia 's First Nation people , driven by an earlier onset of chronic<disease> disease<disease> when compared to the general Australian population. Our objective was to examine the perspectives of Australian First Nation people about healthy ageing. We used a conversational method to gather knowledge from older First Nation people from established communities in New South Wales , Australia. Discussions were audio recorded and transcribed and analysed using an Indigenous research standpoint methodology. Eight yarning circles were held in six locations with 76 participants aged 45 years and over. Key issues around healthy ageing were identified; particularly , what the impact of chronic<disease> disease<disease> means to individuals. Study participants reported that healthy ageing is essential to continue to share knowledge of their history and culture. This article highlights the need for culturally appropriate healthy ageing programs addressing issues related to chronic<disease> disease<disease> among First Nation communities. Implications for public health: Research into what constitutes healthy ageing for older First Nation people is necessary for the development of culturally appropriate chronic<disease> disease<disease> interventions.
