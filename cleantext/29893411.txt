  To determine paediatrician 's knowledge and attitudes about oral health in Trinidad and Tobago. A pre-tested questionnaire was sent out via survey monkey to 70 out of 75 paediatricians registered with the Medical Board of Trinidad and for whom email addresses were available. Hard copies of the questionnaires were delivered to the paediatric departments of the Eric Williams Medical Sciences complex. Paediatricians that were unable to complete the questionnaire online were asked to complete hard copies. Forty-nine paediatricians responded , yielding a response rate of 70 %. Most ( 95.9 %) of the participants had positive views about routine dental visits , but yet only 28.6 % advised a first dental visit between the ages 6 months and 1 year. Although the majority ( 91.8 %) had positive views on fluoride supplementation , knowledge of appropriate fluoride dosages was not in keeping with current guidelines. Mixed views on the role of breastfeeding as a risk factor for developing decay were seen among respondents; 63.3 % of the paediatricians indicated that they did not receive any education on the oral health of young children during their specialty training , and most felt they required additional training in this area. Paediatricians in Trinidad and Tobago demonstrated positive attitudes toward oral health. However , their knowledge with respect to oral disease prevention including the use of fluoride , and timing of the first dental visit appear to be lacking. Paediatricians may benefit from continuing education with regards to the oral health of children.
