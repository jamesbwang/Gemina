  Electric control of magnetism is a prerequisite for efficient and low-power spintronic devices. More specifically , in heavy metal-ferromagnet-insulator heterostructures , voltage gating has been shown to locally and dynamically tune magnetic properties such as interface anisotropy and saturation magnetization. However , its effect on interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction ( DMI) , which is crucial for the stability of magnetic skyrmions , has been challenging to achieve and has not been reported yet for ultrathin films. Here , we demonstrate a 130 % variation of DMI with electric field in Ta/FeCoB/TaO
