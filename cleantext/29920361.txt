  Cell death is a normal phenomenon in the course of biological development , moreover , which is also a prominent feature in lung exposed to hyperoxia. Severe hypoxia occurs in ALI/ARDS patients , who generally require high concentration oxygen therapy assisted by mechanical ventilation. Nevertheless , high oxygen can cause excessive reactive oxygen species ( ROS) , leading to apoptosis in lung epithelial cells , which has been reported in our previous study. Herein , the correlation between increments of ROS and CCN6 expression was negative in CCN6-mediated the mitochondria dependent , intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Our latest research explained that CCN6 can inhibit caspase-8 mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway to protect cells from hyperoxia-induced apoptosis. As demonstrated by Western Blot Analysis , Caspase 8 cleavage and Caspase 3 cleavage in CCN6-depleted cells exceeded the control group treated with high oxygen ( 48 h). And deletion of CCN6 enhanced caspase-8 activation after hyperoxia shown by Flow Cytometry. Although , it is unclear how CCN6 participated in the regulation of apoptotic pathways , the future targeted therapy drugs inhibiting CCN6 may be useful in the treatment of ALI/ARDS.
