  Post-mastectomy lymphedema is one of the most significant , non-life-threatening complications following breast cancer surgery and radiotherapy. Post-mastectomy post-radiotherapy ( PMPR) lymphedema is related to damages to lymphatics and/or veins during/after axillary surgery and radiotherapy. The management of this condition is very challenging; the comprehensive decongestive therapy ( CTD) , which combines physiotherapy , self-management , and hygiene , and is currently considered the standard management ( SM). The aim of this registry study was to evaluate whether the supplementation with Robuvit ® as a lymphedema controlling agent added to CTD over a 2-month period could be more effective than CTD alone. A group of 65 patients with PMPR lymphedema was included in this registry study and followed up for 2 months; 33 were treated with current SM only ( control group) , and 32 were also supplemented with 600 mg/day of Robuvit ® ( active treatment group). At 1- and 2-month follow-up , the decrease in volume was significantly greater in the supplement group ( P < 0.05) , with a final reduction in volume after two months of 654 ± 21 mL ( -19.82 %) versus 433 ± 23 mL ( -12.81 %) in the control group. A more significant decrease in skin thickness and symptoms was also observed in the Robuvit ® group. No side effects were reported. CTD , combined with self-management , can effectively control the excess of limb volume in post-mastectomy lymphedema. Supplementation with Robuvit ® is useful to further reduce limb volume. Later stages of lymphedema seem to be more difficult to manage and may require surgery or more invasive treatments.
