  Globally the access to HIV<pathogen> testing has greatly increased over the past 30 years. Nonetheless , a high proportion of people living with HIV<pathogen> remains undiagnosed , even in resource rich countries. To increase the proportion of people aware of their HIV<pathogen> serostatus and their access to medical care , several strategies have been proposed including HIV<pathogen> rapid test programs offered outside health facilities. The aim of this project was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the HIV<pathogen> rapid testing offered in community and outreach settings in Italy. We conducted a national demonstration project on HIV<pathogen> rapid tests offered in community and outreach settings , including nongovernmental organization ( NGO) facilities , primary care services for migrants and low-threshold services or mobile units for drug users ( DU services). HIV<pathogen> rapid test on oral fluid ( OraQuick Â®; Orasure Technologies) was anonymously offered to eligible people who presented themselves at the selected sites. Those with reactive results were referred to a specialized outpatient unit for confirmatory testing and medical care. Over a period of six months a total of 2949 tests were performed and 45.2 % of individuals tested had not been previously tested. Overall 0.9 % ( 27/2949) of tested people had a preliminary positive test. In NGO facilities the positivity rate was 1 %. All subjects who performed their confirmatory test were confirmed as positive. In services for migrants the positivity rate was 0.5 and 80 % were referred to care ( with 1 false positive test). In DU services we observed the highest positivity rate ( 1.4 %) but the lowest linkage to care ( 67 %) , with 1 false positive test. Our project showed that the offering of an HIV<pathogen> rapid testing program in community and outreach settings in Italy is feasible and that it may reach people who have never been tested before , while having a significant yield in terms of new HIV<pathogen> diagnoses as well.
