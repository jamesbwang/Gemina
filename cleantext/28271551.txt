  Young children are too often exposed to mobile devices ( MD) and most of them had their own device. The adverse effects of a early and prolonged exposure to digital technology on pre-school children has been described by several studies. Aim of the study is to analyze the consequences of MD exposure in pre-school children. We analyzed the documented effects of media exposure on children 's mental and physical health. According to recent studies , MD may interfere with learning , children development , well being , sleep , sight , listening , caregiver-child relationship. Pediatricians should be aware of both the beneficial and side effects of MD and give advice to the families , according to children 's age. In according to literature , the Italian Pediatric Society suggest that the media device exposure in childhood should be modulated by supervisors.
