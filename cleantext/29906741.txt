  Group medical consultations ( GMCs) provide individual medical visits in the presence of â‰¤ 7 peer-patients. In the follow-up of breast cancer , we evaluated the efficacy of a new type of blended care My-GMC , a GMC combined with a tablet-based online app , consisting of three online support group sessions ( SGS) and additional information. This randomized controlled trial compared the effect of My-GMC ( n = 59) with one individual medical visit ( n = 50) ( care as usual). Between-group differences on the outcomes distress and empowerment were analyzed 1 week , 3 and 6 months after the visit. No between-group differences were found for the primary outcomes distress and empowerment. More themes were discussed in GMCs compared to individual visits. Significantly more patients experienced peer-support in GMCs ( 78 %) than via the online app ( 29 %). Satisfaction with the online app was low. My-GMC did not result in improvements in distress or empowerment , which might partly be explained by low baseline distress levels. This paper provides valuable information concerning factors on organizational level as well as individual level influencing the evaluation of a blended care intervention. My-GMC provided an innovative alternative , combining professional and peer-support in face-to-face and online SGS , resulting in additional information provision and peer-support. Further improvement of the apps is needed to improve user satisfaction. NTR3771.
