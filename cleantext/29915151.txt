  All critical developmental and physiological events in a plant 's life cycle depend on the proper activation and repression of specific gene sets , and this often involves epigenetic mechanisms. Some Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with disorders of the epigenetic machinery exhibit pleiotropic defects , including incurved leaves and early flowering , due to the ectopic and heterochronic derepression of developmental regulators. Here , we studied one such mutant class , the incurvata11 ( icu11) loss-of-function mutants. We have identified ICU11 as the founding member of a small gene family that we have named CUPULIFORMIS ( CP). This family is part of the 2-oxoglutarate/Fe ( II)- dependent dioxygenase superfamily. ICU11 and its closest paralog , CP2 , have unequally redundant functions: although cp2 mutants are phenotypically wild type , icu11 cp2 double mutants skip vegetative development and flower upon germination. This phenotype is reminiscent of loss-of-function mutants of the Polycomb-group genes EMBRYONIC FLOWER1 ( EMF1) and EMF2. Double mutants harboring icu11 alleles and loss-of-function alleles of genes encoding components of the epigenetic machinery exhibit synergistic , severe phenotypes , and some are similar to those of emf mutants. Hundreds of genes are misexpressed in icu11 plants , including SEPALLATA3 ( SEP3) , and derepression of SEP3 causes the leaf phenotype of icu11. ICU11 and CP2 are nucleoplasmic proteins that act as epigenetic repressors through an unknown mechanism involving histone modification , but not DNA methylation.
