  After transferring the dark-acclimated cyanobacteria to light , flavodiiron proteins Flv1/Flv3 serve as a main electron acceptor for PSI within the first seconds because Calvin cycle enzymes are inactive in the dark. Synechocystis PCC 6803 mutant Δflv1/Δflv3 devoid of Flv1 and Flv3 retained the PSI chlorophyll P700 in the reduced state over 10 s ( Helman et al. , 2003; Allahverdiyeva et al. , 2013). Study of P700 oxidoreduction transients in dark-acclimated Δflv1/Δflv3 mutant under the action of successive white light pulses separated by dark intervals of various durations indicated that the delayed oxidation of P700 was determined by light activation of electron transport on the acceptor side of PSI. We show that the light-induced redox transients of chlorophyll P700 in dark-acclimated Δflv1/Δflv3 proceed within 2 min , as opposed to 1-3 s in the wild type , and comprise a series of kinetic stages. The release of rate-limiting steps was eliminated by iodoacetamide , an inhibitor of Calvin cycle enzymes. Conversely , the creation with methyl viologen of a bypass electron flow to O
