  The study was to determine seasonal fluctuations and non-nutritional factors associated with bulk tank milk urea nitrogen ( BTMUN). A total of 58,364 BTM testing records were collected from 2364 farms in Central Thailand during September 2014-August 2015. Using square root BTMUN as the outcome , other milk components , farm effect , and sampling time were analyzed by univariable repeated measures linear regression , and significant variables were included in multivariable repeated measures linear regression. The average BTMUN ( standard deviation) was 4.71 ( Â± 1.16) mmol/L. In the final model , BTM fat and protein percentages were associated with BTMUN as quadratic and cubic polynomials , respectively. BTM lactose percentage and the natural logarithm of somatic cell counts were negatively linearly associated with BTMUN. At the farm level , the BTM lactose association was negatively linear; herd BTMUN decreased following an increase of herd lactose average , and BTM lactose slopes were quite different among farms as well. Sampling time had the highest potency for the estimation of BTMUN over time , with lows and highs occurring in August and October , respectively. The variation in test level BTMUN was decreased by 18.6 % compared to the null model , and 6 % of the variance could be explained at the farm level. The results clarify seasonal variation in BTMUN and the relationships among other BTM constituents and BTMUN , which may be useful for understanding how to manage lactating dairy cattle better to keep BTM constituents within normal ranges.
