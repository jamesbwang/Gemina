  Few layer black phosphorus ( BP) has recently emerged as a potential graphene analogue due to its high mobility and direct , appreciable , band gap. The fabrication and characterization of field effect transistors ( FETs) involves exposure of the channel material to an electron beam ( e-beam) in imaging techniques such as transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , and fabrication techniques like electron beam lithography ( EBL). Despite this , the effect of e-beam irradiation on BP-FET performance has not been studied experimentally. In this work , we report the first experimental study on the impact of e-beam irradiation on BP-FETs. An electron beam is known to induce defects and structural changes in 2D materials like graphene , MoS2etc. resulting in the deterioration of the device quality. However , for BP-FETs , we observe an improvement in the on-current and carrier mobility ( Î¼) along with a decrease in threshold voltage ( Vth) on exposure to an e-beam with 15 keV energy for 80 seconds. These changes can be attributed to the capture of electrons by traps near the SiO2-BP interface and reduced BP surface roughness due to e-beam exposure. Hysteresis measurements and physical characterization ( i.e. atomic force microscopy ( AFM) , X-ray photoelectron ( XPS) and Raman spectroscopies) validate these mechanisms. Reduced hysteresis indicates occupation of the traps , AFM surface scans indicate reduced surface roughness and XPS data show a reduced phosphorus oxide ( POx) peak immediately after exposure. Raman measurements indicate a probable structural change due to the interaction between e-beam and BP which could result in better stability.
