  In the field of medicine , nanomaterials , especially those derived using the green method , offer promise as anti-cancer agents and drug carriers. However , the biosafety of metallic nanoparticles used as anti-cancer agents remains a concern. The goal of this systematic review was to compare the cytotoxicity of different plant-mediated syntheses of metallic nanoparticles based on their potency , therapeutic index , and cancer cell type susceptibility in the hopes of identifying the most promising anti-cancer agents. A literature search of electronic databases including Science Direct , PubMed , Springer Link , Google Scholar , and ResearchGate , was conducted to obtain research articles. Keywords such as biosynthesis , plant synthesis , plant-mediated , metallic nanoparticle , cytotoxicity , and anticancer were used in the literature search. All types of research materials that met the inclusion criteria were included in the study regardless of whether the results were positive , negative , or null. The therapeutic index was used as a safety measure for the studied compound of interest. Data from 76 selected articles were extracted and synthesised. Seventy-two studies reported that the cytotoxicity of plant-mediated synthesis of metallic nanoparticles was time and/or dose-dependent. Biosynthesised silver nanoparticles demonstrated higher cytotoxicity potency compared to gold nanoparticles synthesised by the same plants (
