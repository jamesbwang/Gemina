  Recent studies have postulated the presence of functional autoantibodies ( Abs) against L-type voltage gated calcium channels ( VGCCs) in the serum of patients with type 1 diabetes , with various proposed physiological consequences , both islet cell associated and extra-glandular. Arguably , the most potentially damaging effect reported for these Abs is induction of apoptosis in pancreatic beta ( β) cells , yet a convincing pathogenic mechanism remains to be demonstrated. In the current study , we report an assay of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) stress induction in the rat insulinoma cell line Rin A12 , as determined by 2 ' , 7 '- Dichlorofluorescein diacetate ( DCF-DA) fluorescence detection by flow cytometry. We demonstrate that incubation of Rin A12 cells with immunoglobulin G ( IgG) containing anti-VGCC activity from patients with T1D mediates a significant increase in ROS , with subsequent induction of apoptosis , as determined by positivity for annexin V expression. Neither T1D patient-derived IgG lacking anti-VGCC activity or IgG from healthy donors altered ROS or annexin V expression , indicating the new assay is specific for the detection of functional anti-VGCC Abs. Subsequent screening of IgG samples derived from individual patients indicated a prevalence of approximately 75 % in a cohort of 20 patients with T1D. The new cell-based assay provides , for the first time , experimental evidence supporting a plausible pathophysiological mechanism underlying anti-VGCC Ab-mediated apoptosis induction in β cells. Additionally , the assay is a considerable advance on previously published methods for detecting and characterising the functional activity of anti-VGCC Abs in patient-derived samples.
