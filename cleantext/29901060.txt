  We report a strategy to enhance the room temperature low-field magnetoresistance ( LFMR) behavior of Fe3O4 nanoparticle ( NP) assemblies by controlled Zn-substitution. The Zn-substituted 7 nm ZnxFe3-xO4 , ( x = 0 to 0.4) NPs are prepared by thermal decomposition of metal acetylacetonates ( M ( acac) n , M = Fe2 + , Fe3 + , and Zn2 +). The substitution increases NP magnetic susceptibility ( Ï‡) and makes the magnetic moment more sensitive to low magnetic fields. As a result , the Zn0 .3 Fe2 .7 O4 NP assembly with NPs separated by tridecanoate exhibits a large magnetoresistance ( MR) ratio of -14.8 % at 300 K under a 4.5 kOe magnetic field. The demonstrated approach to control NP substitution to enhance low-field magnetoresistance of the NP assemblies provides an attractive new strategy to fabricate Fe3O4-based magnetic NP assemblies with desirable transport properties for sensitive spintronic applications.
