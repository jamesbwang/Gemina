  The purpose of this study was to compare the new bone formation capability of zirconia with those of other synthetic bone grafts. Twelve rabbits were used and four 6-mm diameter transcortical defects were formed on each calvaria. Each defect was filled with Osteon II ( Os) , Tigran PTG ( Ti) , and zirconia ( Zi) bone grafts. For the control group , the defects were left unfilled. The rabbits were sacrificed at 2 , 4 , and 8 weeks. Specimens were analyzed through micro computed tomography ( CT) and histomorphometric analysis. The Ti and Zi groups showed significant differences in the amount of newly formed bone between 2 and 4 weeks and between 2 and 8 weeks ( Zirconia bone graft material showed satisfactory results in new bone formation and zirconia could be used as a new synthetic bone graft material.
