  Outcomes of bariatric surgery for super obese Asians are not well reported. We aimed to compare short-term outcomes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG) in Asian patients with body mass index ( BMI) < 47.5 kg/m A total of 272 patients from Singapore university hospital who underwent LSG from 2008 to 2015 with a follow-up of at least 6 months were included in the study. Primary endpoint was weight<symptom> loss<symptom> at 1-year and 3-years. Morbid obesity ( Group 1 , G1) was defined as BMI < 47.5 kg/m There were 215 patients in G1 and 57 patients in G2 ( mean preoperative weight: 107.3 kg and 146.8 kg; mean follow-up: 27.9 and 26.8 months , respectively). Mean total weight<symptom> loss<symptom> at 3-year of 41.9 kg for G2 was significantly higher ( LSG is an equally safe and effective operation in Asians with BMI â‰¥ 47.5 kg/m2 when compare to patients with BMI < 47.5 kg/m
