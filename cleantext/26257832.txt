  AH-7921 is a synthetic opioid that was developed in the early 1970s. It has resulted in several fatal and nonfatal intoxications , despite not having approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. To date , AH-7921 is listed as a schedule I drug , and there have been no clinical trials exploring the safety of AH-7921. Herein , we provide an analysis of existing case reports available in the literature regarding AH-7921. We searched PubMed , Scopus , Web of Science , and EBSCO for articles ( up until December 2017) using the terms `` AH-7921 '' and `` AH7921. '' In total , 48 articles were identified , and 5 articles were included in our review. A total of 14 cases were found , of which 13 resulted in fatalities. The oral route of administration was reported in two cases , and most cases reported use of concomitant pharmaceutical agents. Pulmonary<symptom> edema<symptom> was the most common finding postmortem among deceased cases , with nine of the cases having heavier lungs. Overall , fatalities occurred with low and high concentrations of AH-7921 in the femoral blood. We strongly encourage toxicology screenings for this novel opioid to be included when an overdose of an opioid of unknown nature is suggested.
