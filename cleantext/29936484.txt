  Little is known about the correlation between contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS) characteristics and pathological prognostic factors in breast cancer. The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between CEUS characteristics and pathological prognostic factors. A retrospective study with 34 malignant breast lesions<symptom> was conducted. CEUS characteristics included qualitative characteristics ( e.g. lesion<symptom> 's enhancement degree and order , internal lesion<symptom> homogeneity etc.) and quantitative characteristics ( e.g. peak intensity , time to peak etc.). Also , pathological prognostic factors were included ( e.g. tumor grade , estrogen receptor status etc.). Blurred lesion<symptom> margins were observed more often in tumors of high histological grade ( p = 0.01) and in estrogen receptor-negative tumors ( p = 0.049). Furthermore , perilesional enhancement was associated with positive Ki-67 expression ( p = 0.049) , while heterogeneous internal sentinel lymph node enhancement was associated with malignant infiltration of the node ( p = 0.002). CEUS has the potential to provide a prevision of pathological prognostic factors in malignant breast lesions<symptom> , helping in the better early patient management.
