  An endolymphatic sac tumor ( ELST) is a rare , indolent but locally aggressive tumor arising in the posterior petrous ridge. Patients present with sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus<symptom>. As the tumor progresses , patients may experience vertigo<symptom> , ataxia<symptom> , facial nerve paresis , pain and otorrhea. Most patients present in their 4th or 5th decade with a wide age range. Patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease have an increased likelihood of developing ELST. Histologically , ELST is a low-grade adenocarcinoma. As it progresses , it destroys bone and extends into adjacent tissues. The likelihood of regional or distant metastases is remote. The optimal treatment is resection with negative margins. Patients with positive margins , gross residual disease , or unresectable tumor are treated with radiotherapy or radiosurgery. Late recurrences are common , so long follow-up is necessary to assess efficacy. The likelihood of cure depends on tumor extent and is probably in the range of 50-75 %.
