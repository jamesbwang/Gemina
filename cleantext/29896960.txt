  Mesoporous TS-1 ( MTS-1) containing organic templates tetrapropylammonium hydroxide ( TPAOH) and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride is synthesized and treated with different concentrations of hydrochloric acid aqueous solution. The as-synthesized MTS-1 are characterized using X-ray diffraction , Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR) , scanning electron microscopy , transmission electron microscopy , UV-vis ,
