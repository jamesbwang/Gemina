  Fish consumption benefits early cognitive development and cardiovascular health because of the n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the fish , but toxic pollutants in fish , like dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls ( dl-PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans ( PCDD/Fs) , may decrease or counteract these benefits. In this study , the fatty acids , dl-PCBs , and PCDD/Fs were analyzed in paired muscle and skin from 13 fish and one squid species from the Bohai coast , which have been influenced by serious dioxin pollution from the Bohai Rim Region. The total fatty acid concentrations in the muscle and skin were 2.6-87 and 3.6-156 mg/g wet weight ( ww) , respectively. The total polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations were higher in skin than muscle for almost half of the species. The total PCDD/F and dl-PCB toxic equivalents in the muscle and skin were 0.055-0.68 and 0.0099-0.43 pg/g ww , respectively , and were up to five times higher in the muscle than in the skin for eight species. Few benefit-risk studies for fish consumption with and without skin have been performed , so benefit-risk quotients ( BRQs) for eating only muscle , only skin , and eating both were calculated. To achieve the recommended 250 mg of EPA + DHA intake , eating only muscle , only skin , and eating both from seven species with BRQs < 1 would cause no significant risk. Removing skin before eating is not necessary for these species. Three fish species had BRQs < 1 for muscle only but BRQs > 1 for skin only. Removing skin before eating would be better for these species. The other four fish species had BRQs > 1 for eating only muscle , only skin , and eating both , indicating the potential risk caused by PCDD/F and dl-PCB. Amounts of the four fish species consumed should be decreased , and other sources of EPA and DHA should be selected.
