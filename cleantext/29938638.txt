  Death can be pronounced on both circulatory and brain criteria. In both cases , irreversible loss of brain function is essential in understanding finale death , as irreversible loss of breathing- a brainstem function- is mandatory. Brain function ceases irreversibly as a consequence of lack of blood supply to the brain , caused by circulatory arrest or by raised intracranial pressure. Brain function is central in death , which must be reflected in a future death criterion , stated in WHO 's new death criterion based on irreversible loss of capacity for consciousness<symptom> and loss of brainstem function.
