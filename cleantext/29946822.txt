  The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of training state on fasting-induced skeletal muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase ( PDH) regulation , including PDH phosphorylation. Trained and untrained subjects , matched for skeletal muscle CS activity and OXPHOS protein , fasted for 36 h after receiving a standardized meal. Respiratory exchange ratio ( RER) was measured and blood as well as vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained 2 , 12 , 24 , and 36 h after the meal. RER decreased with fasting only in untrained individuals , while PDHa activity decreased from 12 h after the meal in untrained , but only tended to decrease at 36 h in trained. PDH-E1Î± , PDP1 protein , PDH phosphorylation , and PDH acetylation in skeletal muscle was higher in trained than untrained subjects , but did not change with fasting , while PDK4 protein was higher at 36 h than at 2 h after the meal in both groups. In conclusion , the present results suggest that endurance exercise training modifies the fasting-induced regulation of PDHa activity in skeletal muscle and the substrate switch towards fat oxidation. PDH phosphorylation could not explain the fasting-induced regulation of PDHa activity suggesting other post translational modifications.
