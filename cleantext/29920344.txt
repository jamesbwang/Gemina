  Endometrial carcinoma is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in females. Long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) have been associated with cancer; its role in endometrial carcinoma is an emerging area of research. In this article , lncRNA TDRG1 expression in human endometrial carcinoma tissues and normal endometrial tissues was quantified by qRT-PCR. LncRNA TDRG1 was overexpressed or knocked-down in neither HEC-1B nor Ishikawa endometrial carcinoma cells , respectively , to assess cellular phenotype and expression of related molecules. Our results showed that lncRNA TDRG1 was significantly overexpressed in endometrial carcinoma tissues. Overexpression of lncRNA TDRG1 promoted endometrial carcinoma cell viability , invasion and migratory ability , inhibited apoptosis , and upregulated VEGF-A , PI3K , Bcl-2 , MMP2 and survivin; knockdown of lncRNA TDRG1 had the opposite effects. LncRNA TDRG1 overexpression increased tumorigenicity in vivo and was associated with the upregulation of VEGF-A. RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation ( RIP) assays confirmed that lncRNA TDRG1 directly binds to VEGF-A protein. Furthermore , knockdown of VEGFA in lncRNA TDRG1-overexpressing endometrial carcinoma cells reversed the effects of lncRNA TDRG1 on cell proliferation , invasion , migration and apoptosis. In conclusion , lncRNA TDRG1 may promote endometrial carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion by positively targeting VEGF-A and modulating relative genes.
