  To define standard criteria for the detection of lipohypertrophy using ultrasonography and to determine the accuracy of this method. Individuals using insulin therapy for ≥ 2 years with unknown lipohypertrophy status were enrolled at a diabetes education centre. A team of diabetes educator nurses performed a clinical examination for evidence of lipohypertrophy and a separate team of ultrasonographers examined participants in a blinded fashion. The echo signature for lipohypertrophy consisted of location in the subcutaneous layer and lesions<symptom> that were 1) well circumscribed either by hyperechoic foci with defined borders or a nodular shape with a hypoechoic halo , 2) heterogeneous in echotexture compared with surrounding tissue , 3) associated with distortion of surrounding connective tissue with 4) absence of vascularity and 5) absence of capsule. Ultrasonography identified individuals with lipohypertrophy significantly more frequently than inspection or palpation ( P < 0.0001). Inter-observer agreement was moderate ( κ = 0.50) and limited by the presence of subclinical lesions<symptom> in 73 % of the participants. The ultrasound detection of lipohypertrophy is consistent with clinical examination and is reproducible using a defined echo signature. ( ClinicalTrials.gov registration no: NCT02348099).
