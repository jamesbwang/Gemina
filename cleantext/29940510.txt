  After a long-term toxicity study on Bisphenol A ( BPA) , the European Union and U.S food and drug administration updating the rules regarding the usage of BPA by extending the prohibition of BPA to include in the production of papers , on February 2018. Therefore , it is essential to establish the trace level BPA detectors in paper samples. In this report , the synthesis of novel ZnO nanoclusters wrapped with reduced graphene oxide ( ZnO NCs/rGO) and its application towards the selective electrocatalytic detection of BPA are described. Initially , ZnO NCs/rGO is synthesized by the one-step hydrothermal approach , and various characterizations explain the compound 's compositions and structure. The significance of ZnO NCs/rGO together with good electrocatalytic properties leads this material to the platform for electrochemical sensor. Finally , ZnO NCs/rGO was fabricated and validated as an effective sensor for the sensitive detection of BPA. The demonstrated sensor revealed excellent detection of BPA with the very low detection limit ( 2.1 nM) , and also it offered good analytical parameters with more extensive linear range and higher sensitivity. Likewise , the sensor annexes good durability , reproducibility , and selectivity towards the determination of BPA. Due to the nourishing capacity of the prepared ZnO NCs/rGO , it is employed for the detection of BPA in tissue paper samples.
