  Unlike mammalian erythrocytes , amphibian erythrocytes have distinct morphological features including large cell sizes and the presence of nuclei. The sizes of the cytoplasm and nuclei of erythrocytes vary significantly over different species , their environments , or pathophysiology , which makes hematological studies important for investigating amphibian species. Here , we present a label-free three-dimensional optical quantification of individual amphibian erythrocytes from frogs Pelophylax nigromaculatus ( Rana nigromaculata). Using optical diffraction tomography , we measured three-dimensional refractive index ( RI) tomograms of the cells , which clearly distinguished the cytoplasm and nuclei of the erythrocytes. From the measured RI tomograms , we extracted the relevant biochemical parameters of the cells , including hemoglobin contents and hemoglobin concentrations. Furthermore , we measured dynamic membrane fluctuations and investigated the mechanical properties of the cell membrane. From the statistical and correlative analysis of these retrieved parameters , we investigated interspecific differences between frogs and previously studied mammals.
