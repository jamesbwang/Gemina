  SBA-15 and MCM-41 nanoporous silica sorbents were synthesized and functionalized by amine groups and used , for the first time , for packing a needle trap device ( NTD). The characteristics of the synthesized SBA-15 and MCM-41 sorbents were investigated by X-ray diffraction , scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy. The NTD coupling to gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector ( GC-FID) was carried out to extract and determine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs) in contaminated soil samples. The performances of the sorbents for the extraction of PAHs were compared under identical conditions and the NH2-SBA-15 sorbent showed superior results. Extraction temperature , extraction time , recycling gas flow rate , sample moisture , desorption time and desorption temperature were evaluated and optimized for the system. Under the optimum conditions , detection limits of 0.0004-0.0035 μg g-1 , quantitation limits of 0.001-0.01 μg g-1 and relative standard deviations of 7.4-14.9 % were obtained for the PAHs. The results showed the more effectiveness of this sorbent for the extraction of the PAHs compared to that of a commercial sorbent. The method was successfully applied for the extraction and determination of PAHs in polluted soil samples collected from gas stations , with recoveries ranging from 64 to 112 %.
