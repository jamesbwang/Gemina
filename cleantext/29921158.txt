  Detecting gene-environment ( G × E) interactions in the context of genome-wide association studies ( GWAS) is a challenging problem since standard methods generally present a lack of power. An additional difficulty arises from the fact that the causal exposure is seldom observed and only a proxy of this exposure is observed. This leads to an additional drop in terms of power and it explains the failure of standard methods in detecting interactions , even very strong ones. In this article , we consider the latent exposure as a source of heterogeneity and we propose a new powerful method , named `` Breakpoint Model for Logistic Regression '' ( BMLR) , based on a breakpoint model , in order to detect G × E interactions when causal exposure is unobserved. First , the BMLR method is compared to the ordered-subset analysis for case-control method , which has been developed for the same purpose , through simulations. This highlights the ability of BMLR to detect the heterogeneity , and therefore , to detect interaction with latent exposure. Finally , the BMLR method is compared to standard methods , such as Plink , to perform a GWAS on a published realistic benchmark.
