  As one of the key initiators of the base excision repair process , uracil-DNA glycosylase ( UDG) plays an important role in maintaining genomic integrity. It has been found that aberrant expression of UDG is associated with a variety of diseases. Thus , accurate and sensitive detection of UDG activity is of critical significance for biomedical research and early clinical diagnosis. Here , we developed a novel fluorescent sensing platform for UDG activity detection based on a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( TdT) and T7 exonuclease ( T7 Exo)- aided recycling amplification strategy. In this strategy , only two DNA oligonucleotides ( DNA substrate containing one uracil base and Poly dT probe labeled with a fluorophore/quencher pair) are used. UDG catalyzes the removal of uracil base from the enclosed dumbbell-shape DNA substrate to give an apyrimidinic site , at which the substrate oligonucleotide is cleaved by endonuclease IV. The released 3 '- end can be elongated by TdT to form a long deoxyadenine-rich ( Poly dA) tail , which may be used as a recyclable template to initiate T7 Exo-mediated hybridization-digestion cycles of the Poly dT probe , giving a significantly enhanced fluorescence output. The proposed UDG-sensing strategy showed excellent selectivity and high sensitivity with a detection limit of 1.5 Ã— 10
