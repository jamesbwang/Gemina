  This study aims to examine the association between Q-angle and clinical , radiological , and ultrasonographic findings in patients with knee osteoarthritis ( OA). Sixty-eight female patients ( mean age 59.8 ± 6.8 years; range 39 to 78 years) diagnosed with knee OA were included in this study and classified into two groups according to Q-angle of symptomatic knees: low Q-angle group ( LQ) ( n = 40) and high Q-angle group ( HQ) ( n = 28) ( LQ-angle < 15 ° and HQ-angle ≥ 15 ° , respectively). Patients were clinically assessed for pain and functional status by using a visual analog scale and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis<disease> Index. X-rays of knees were scored using the Kellgren-Lawrence OA grading system. Symptomatic knees were also evaluated using ultrasonography for distal femoral cartilage thickness/grading. No significant difference was observed in clinical and imaging findings between the groups ( p > 0.05). HQ-angle measurements were positively correlated with cartilage grading by ultrasonography ( r = 0.435 , p = 0.033) and Kellgren-Lawrence grading system ( r = 0.435 , p = 0.021) , and negatively correlated with cartilage thickness measurements of the medial femoral condyle ( r = -0.399 , p = 0.036). We found that HQ-angle was associated with cartilage thickness measurements of the medial femoral condyle and cartilage grading by ultrasonography and the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system in patients with knee OA.
