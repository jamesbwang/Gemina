  Rye kernel bread ( RKB) evening meals improve glucose tolerance , enhance appetite<symptom> regulation and increase satiety in healthy volunteers. These beneficial effects on metabolic responses have been shown to be associated with increased gut fermentation. The present study aimed to elucidate if RKB evening meals may cause rapid alterations in microbiota composition that might be linked to metabolic- , immune- , and appetite<symptom>- parameters. Gut-brain axis interaction was also studied by relating microbiota composition to amount of brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) in blood plasma. Nineteen healthy volunteers , ten women and nine men aged 22-29 years , BMI < 25 ( NCT02093481) participated in the study performed in a crossover design. Each person was assigned to either white wheat bread ( WWB) or RKB intake as a single evening meal or three consecutive evenings. Stool<symptom> and blood samples as well as subjective appetite<symptom> ratings were obtained the subsequent morning after each test occasion , resulting in four independent collections per participant (
