  The use of alkaline phosphatase ( ALP) as a biomarker in some diseases including hepatitis<disease> , obstructive jaundice , osteoblastic bone cancer , and osteomalacia is important in clinical diagnosis. Furthermore , ALP activity detection is an essential hot topic in environmental monitoring , biomedical research , and other research fields. In this study , a novel `` signal-on '' photoelectrochemical ( PEC) biosensor based on the ALP-catalyzed phosphorylation reaction was designed to sensitively detect ALP activity. In this design , ascorbic acid-an electron donor-was catalytically produced by ALP from l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate trisodium salt in situ , which results in an increased photocurrent response signal. For immobilizing the ALP on the electrode surface , poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride was used for the conjugation of ALP , and titanium dioxide ( TiO
