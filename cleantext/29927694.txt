  DNA methylation plays an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC). The current study aimed to identify aberrantly methylated-differentially expressed genes ( DEGs) by a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. In addition , we screened for DEGs affected by DNA methylation modification and further investigated their prognostic values for HNSCC. We included microarray data of DNA methylation ( GSE25093 and GSE33202) and gene expression ( GSE23036 and GSE58911) from Gene Expression Omnibus. Aberrantly methylated-DEGs were analyzed with R software. The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA) RNA sequencing and DNA methylation ( Illumina HumanMethylation450) databases were utilized for validation. In total , 27 aberrantly methylated genes accompanied by altered expression were identified. After confirmation by The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA) database , 2 hypermethylated-low-expression genes ( FAM135B and ZNF610) and 2 hypomethylated-high-expression genes ( HOXA9 and DCC) were identified. A receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve confirmed the diagnostic value of these four methylated genes for HNSCC. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that FAM135B methylation was a favorable independent prognostic biomarker for overall survival of HNSCC patients.
