  We aimed to examine the associations of leisure-time physical activity ( PA) and sedentary behavior ( SB) with the prevalence of sarcopenia , body composition and muscle strength among older adults having overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome<disease> , from the PREDIMED-Plus trial. Cross-sectional baseline analysis including 1539 men and women ( 65 Â± 5 y). Sarcopenia was defined as low muscle mass ( according to FNIH cut-offs) plus low muscle strength ( lowest sex-specific tertile for 30-s chair-stand test). We applied multivariable-adjusted Cox regression with robust variance and constant time ( given the cross-sectional design) for the associations of self-reported leisure-time PA and SB with sarcopenia; and multivariable-linear regression for the associations with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA)- derived bone mass , fat mass , lean mass and lower-limb muscle strength. Inverse associations were observed between sarcopenia and each hourly increment in total ( prevalence ratio 0.81 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.70 , 0.93)) , moderate ( 0.80 ( 0.66 , 0.97)) , vigorous ( 0.51 ( 0.32 , 0.84)) , and moderate-vigorous PA ( MVPA) ( 0.74 ( 0.62 , 0.89)). Incrementing 1-h/day total-PA and MVPA was inversely associated with body-mass-index , waist circumference ( WC) , fat mass , and positively associated with bone mass and lower-limb muscle strength ( all P < .05). One h/day increase in total SB , screen-based SB and TV-viewing was positively associated with body-mass-index , WC and fat mass. Light-PA was not significantly associated with any outcome. Total-PA and PA at moderate and high intensities may protect against the prevalence of sarcopenia , have a beneficial role on body composition and prevent loss of muscle strength. SB , particularly TV-viewing , may have detrimental effects on body composition in older adults at high cardiovascular risk.
