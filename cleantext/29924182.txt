  to verify persistence of metabolic syndrome<disease> ( MetS) and components in overweight children and adolescents , as well as its relation to socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and to the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth ( PDAY) score. a two-point longitudinal study: at enrollment and after a 24-month interval , with 133 individuals ages from two to 18 years. The demographic anthropomorphic and blood variables were evaluated. Analysis was carried out by simple and paired association tests , as well as multiple logistic regression. persistent MetS was observed in 38.3 % of the sample , associated cardiovascular risk ( ACR) in 79.7 % , reduction in arterial pressure and do HDL-c. After adjusting for age and sex , excess weight ( ExpB: 0.182; CI: 0.059-0.561) , low HDL-c ( ExpB: 9.247; CI: 1.157-73.930) and high LDL-c ( ExpB: 1.915; CI: 0.921-3.979) were associated with persistent MetS. persistent MetS was associated with obesity , HDL-c and LDL-c , but not with the PDAY score.
