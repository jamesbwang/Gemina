  Obesity and its associated metabolic disorders are spreading at a fast pace throughout the world; thus , effective therapeutic approaches are necessary to combat this epidemic. Obesity develops when there is a greater caloric intake than energy expenditure. Promoting energy expenditure has recently attracted much attention as a promising approach for the management of body<symptom> weight. Thermogenic adipocytes are capable of burning fat to dissipate chemical energy into heat , thereby enhancing energy expenditure. After the recent re-discovery of thermogenic adipocytes in adult humans , much effort has focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms , especially the epigenetic mechanisms , which regulate thermogenic adipocyte development and function. A number of chromatin signatures , such as histone modifications , DNA methylation , chromatin accessibilities , and interactions , have been profiled at the genome level and analyzed in various murine and human thermogenic fat cell systems. Moreover , writers and erasers , as well as readers of the epigenome are also investigated using genomic tools in thermogenic adipocytes. In this review , we summarize and discuss the recent advance in these studies and highlight the insights gained into the epigenomic regulation of thermogenic program as well as the pathogenesis of human metabolic diseases.
