  In this paper , the active disturbance rejection control ( ADRC) is utilized to stabilize the vibration of perturbed Timoshenko beam model with tip mass. The boundary control design is based on a hybrid PDE-ODE model , and is accompanied with designing a high-gain extended state observer ( ESO) that is used to estimate the boundary disturbances. By transforming the model into the appropriate state space , the semigroup theory is employed to prove the well-posedness of the closed-loop system. To this end , it is proved by a frequency domain method that the semigroup generated by the system operator is exponentially stable , which allows to conclude the boundedness of perturbed closed-loop system response. The stability of the closed-loop system is further analyzed using the Lyapunov approach. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the efficacy of the suggested method.
