  The ( O-acyl)- ω-hydroxy fatty acids ( OAHFA) are an unusual lipid subclass present in the skin , vernix caseosa and meibomian gland secretions. While they are structurally related to the general class of fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids ( FAHFA) , the ultra-long chain ( 30-34 carbons) and putative ω-substitution of the backbone hydroxy fatty acid suggest OAHFA have unique biochemistry. Complete structural elucidation of OAHFA has been challenging due to their low abundance within complex lipid matrices. Furthermore , the occurrence of these compounds as a mixture of closely related isomers has meant that no spectroscopic data have been obtained to guide structure confirmation by total synthesis. Exploiting the gas-phase purification of lipids through multi-stage mass spectrometry and novel , multi-dimensional ion activation methods , we describe the full molecular structure of ultra-long chain OAHFAs extracted from human meibum; assigning sites of unsaturation , stereochemical configuration of carbon-carbon double bonds , and ester linkage regiochemistry. Such isomer-resolved mass spectrometry has guided the first total synthesis of ( O-acyl)- ω-hydroxy fatty acids which , in turn , confirm the structure of the most abundant OAHFA found in human meibum , OAHFA 50:2. The availability of a synthetic OAHFA opens new territory for future investigations into the unique biophysical and biochemical properties of these lipids.
