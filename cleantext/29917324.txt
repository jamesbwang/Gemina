  A combination of H1 antihistamine ( AH) with intranasal corticosteroid ( INCS) is commonly prescribed to patients with allergic rhinitis ( AR) who have an inadequate response to monotherapy. In this systematic review we aimed to determine the effects of AH combined with INCS ( AH-INCS) for treating AR. Literature searches were performed using Medline and Embase. Randomized , controlled trials that studied the effects of AH-INCS vs INCS monotherapy for treating patients with AR were included. The primary outcomes were total nasal symptom scores , total ocular symptom scores , and disease-specific quality of life. The secondary outcomes were objective tests for nasal patency and adverse events. Sixteen studies ( 4026 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Compared with INCS , AH-INCS decreased total nasal symptom scores ( standardized mean difference ( SMD) , -0.13; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , -0.19 to -0.06; p < 0.001; 10 trials , 3348 patients) and total ocular symptom scores ( SMD , -0.12 , 95 % CI , -0.20 to -0.04; p = 0.003; 6 trials , 2378 patients). Subgroup analysis indicated no benefit with the oral AH-INCS combination but did show benefit with intranasal AH-INCS ( SMD , -0.18; 95 % CI , -0.27 to -0.09; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences with regard to disease-specific quality of life ( SMD , -0.07; 95 % CI , -0.16 to 0.02; p = 0.12; 6 trials , 1981 patients) , nasal inspiratory flow ( MD , -0.03 L/min; 95 % CI , -0.57 to 0.50; p = 0.91; 1 trial , 54 patients) , or adverse events. Intranasal AH-INCS has benefit over INCS on nasal and ocular symptom improvement for treating AR. Oral AH-INCS is not recommended.
