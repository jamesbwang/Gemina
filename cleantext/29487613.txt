  The increased cardiovascular disease ( CVD) risk in subjects with type 2 diabetes ( T2D) is well established. This review collates the available evidence and assesses the shared genetic background between T2D and CVD: the causal contribution of common risk factors to T2D and CVD and how genetics can be used to improve drug development and clinical outcomes. Large-scale genome-wide association studies ( GWAS) of T2D and CVD support a shared genetic background but minimal individual locus overlap. Mendelian randomisation ( MR) analyses show that T2D is causal for CVD , but GWAS of CVD , T2D and their common risk factors provided limited evidence for individual locus overlap. Distinct but functionally related pathways were enriched for CVD and T2D genetic associations reflecting the lack of locus overlap and providing some explanation for the variable associations of common risk factors with CVD and T2D from MR analyses.
