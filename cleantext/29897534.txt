  Risk assessment of chemical hazards is typically based on single critical health effects. The present work aims to expand the current approach by characterizing the dose-related sequence of the development of multiple ( lower- to higher-order) toxicological health effects caused by a chemical. To this end a `` reference point profile '' is defined as the relation between benchmark doses for considered health effects , and a standardized severity score determined for these effects. For a given dose of a chemical or mixture the probability for exceeding the reference point profile , thereby provoking lower- to higher-order effects , can be assessed. The overall impact at the same dose can also be derived by integrating contributions across all health effects following severity-weighting. In its generalized form the new impact metric relates to the probability of response for the most severe health effects. Reference points ( points of departure) corresponding to defined levels of response can also be estimated. The proposed concept , which is evaluated for dioxin-like chemicals , provides an alternative for characterizing the low dose region below the reference point for a severe effect like cancer. The shape and variability of the reference point profile add new dimensions to risk assessment , which for example extends the characterization of chemical potency , and the concept of acceptable effect sizes for individual health effects. Based on the present data the method shows high stability at low doses/responses , and is also robust to differences in severity categorization of effects. In conclusion , the novel method proposed enables risk-based integration of multiple dose-related health effects. It provides a first step towards a more comprehensive characterization of chemical toxicity , and suggests a potential for improved low-dose risk assessment.
