  Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS) technologies are revolutionizing the field of biology and metagenomic-based research. Since the volume of metagenomic data is typically very large , De novo metagenomic assembly can be effectively used to reduce the total amount of data and enhance quality of downstream analysis , such as annotation and binning. Although , there are many freely available assemblers , but selecting one suitable for a specific goal can be highly challenging. In this study , the performance of 11 well-known assemblers was evaluated in the assembly of three different metagenomes. The results obtained show that metaSPAdes is the best assembler and Megahit is a good choice for conservative assembly strategy. In addition , this research provides useful information regarding the pros and cons of each assembler and the effect of read length on assembly , thereby helping scholars to select the optimal assembler based on their objectives.
