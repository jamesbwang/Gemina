  Controlled-release multiparticulate systems of hydrophilic drugs usually suffer from poor encapsulation and rapid-release rate. In the present study , ultra-high loaded controlled release polymeric beads containing verapamil hydrochloride ( VP) as hydrophilic model drug were efficiently prepared using superamphiphobic substrates aiming to improve patient compliance by reducing dosing frequency. Superamphiphobic substrates were fabricated using clean aluminum sheets etched with ammonia<pathogen> solution and were treated with 1.5 % ( w/v) perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane ( PFDTS) alcoholic solution. The effect of the main polymer type ( lactide/glycolide ( PLGA) 5004A , PLGA 5010 , and polycaprolactone ( PCL)) , copolymer ( Eudragit RS100) content together with the effect of drug load on encapsulation efficiency ( EE %) and in vitro drug release was statistically studied and optimized via D-optimal statistical design. In vivo pharmacokinetic study was carried out to compare the optimized system relative to the market product ( Isoptin
