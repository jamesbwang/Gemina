  Based on the co-crystal structure of bicalutamide with a T877A-mutated androgen receptor ( AR) , glycerol and aminoglycerol derivatives were designed and synthesized as a novel type of carborane-containing AR modulators. The ( R)- isomer of 6c , whose chirality is derived from the glycerol group , showed 20 times more potent cell inhibitory activity against LNCaP cell lines expressing T877A-mutated AR than the corresponding ( S)- isomer. Docking studies of both isomers with AR suggested that ( R) -6 c is in closer spatial proximity to helix-12 of the AR than ( S) -6 c , which is the most important common motif in the secondary structure of AR for the expression of antagonistic activity.
