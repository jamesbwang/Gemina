  Heat stress during grain filling substantially decreases wheat productivity; thus , to ensure food security , heat tolerance in wheat needs to be developed. In this study , we evaluated the effect of heat priming applied during the stem-elongation stage , booting and anthesis , followed by 5 days of severe heat stress ( a 7.86 Â°C rise in temperature) during the grain-filling stage on physiological activities and grain yield of winter wheat in pot experiments during the 2015-2017 growing seasons using the winter wheat cultivars Yangmai 18 ( a vernal type) and Yannong 19 ( a facultative type). Compared with the damage observed in non-primed plants , heat priming during the stem-elongation stage and booting significantly prevented the grain-yield damage caused by heat stress during grain filling. Heat-primed plants displayed higher sucrose contents and sucrose-phosphate activity in leaves and greater above-ground dry matter than non-primed plants. Priming during stem elongation and booting led to increased photosynthetic capacity , stomatal conductance and chlorophyll contents in comparison with non-priming. Improved tolerance to heat stress due to the enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and peroxidase and reductions in reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde production was observed in primed plants compared with non-primed plants of both cultivars. The positive effect of heat priming on the response to heat stress during grain filling was more pronounced in plants primed at the booting stage than in those primed at the stem-elongation or anthesis stage. Moreover , the vernal-type Yangmai 18 benefited more from heat priming than did Yannong 19 , as evidenced by its higher productivity. We conclude that heat priming during early reproductive-stage growth can improve post-anthesis heat tolerance in winter wheat.
