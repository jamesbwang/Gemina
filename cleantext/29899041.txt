  Photoreceptor-specific ciliopathies often affect a structure that is considered functionally homologous to the ciliary transition zone ( TZ) called the connecting cilium ( CC). However , it is unclear how mutations in certain ciliary genes disrupt the photoreceptor CC without impacting the primary cilia systemically. By applying stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy technology in different genetic models , we show that the CC can be partitioned into two regions: the proximal CC ( PCC) , which is homologous to the TZ of primary cilia , and the distal CC ( DCC) , a photoreceptor-specific extension of the ciliary TZ. This specialized distal zone of the CC in photoreceptors is maintained by SPATA7 , which interacts with other photoreceptor-specific ciliary proteins such as RPGR and RPGRIP1. The absence of
