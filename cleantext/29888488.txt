  Acrylic resin properties are susceptible to change over the duration of use , thereby decreasing prosthesis longevity. To make the material less susceptible to the action of external agents such as stain-causing liquids and cleaning solutions , polishing procedures are recommended. A specific mechanical polishing procedure performed regularly was evaluated regarding the biofilm adhesion , surface roughness ( Ra) , color stability ( ΔE) , and mass changes in acrylic resin artificial teeth. Sixty artificial teeth divided into two groups ( n = 30) were immersed in distilled water ( WT) and coffee ( CF). These groups were then subdivided ( n = 10) according to the type of polishing procedure administered: no polishing , biweekly polishing ( once every 2 weeks) ( pol 1) , or monthly polishing ( once a month) ( pol 2) , using aluminum oxide paste and a felt polishing wheel attached to an electric motor at a speed of 3000 rpm. Properties were evaluated at baseline and after 4 , 8 , 12 , and 24 months of simulated immersion. At the end , the adhesion of Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> and Streptococcus<pathogen> mutans<pathogen> multispecies biofilm in all groups was assessed. The CF group showed an increased Ra and weight , and a significantly greater ΔE compared to the WT group. The polishing procedure reduced Ra and minimized the stains caused by coffee , without losing mass , with the biweekly regime more effective than the monthly regime. Also , polishing reduced the adhesion of biofilm in the CF groups , again with the biweekly regime the most effective. When performed regularly , the mechanical polishing procedure tested reduces the changes in artificial teeth subjected to immersion in coffee , with the biweekly frequency most effective regarding the properties evaluated.
