  Chronic pancreatitis<pathogen> is a syndrome<pathogen> involving inflammation<pathogen> , fibrosis<pathogen> , and loss of acinar and islet cells which can manifest in unrelenting abdominal<pathogen> pain<pathogen> , malnutrition , and exocrine and endocrine insufficiency. The Toxic-Metabolic , Idiopathic , Genetic , Autoimmune , Recurrent and Severe Acute Pancreatitis<pathogen> , Obstructive ( TIGAR-O) classification system categorizes known causes and factors that contribute to chronic pancreatitis.<pathogen> Although determining disease<pathogen> etiology provides a framework for focused and specific treatments , chronic pancreatitis<pathogen> remains a challenging condition to treat owing to the often refractory , centrally mediated pain and the lack of consensus regarding when endoscopic therapy and surgery are indicated. Further complications incurred include both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency , pseudocyst formation , bile duct obstruction , and pancreatic cancer. Medical treatment of chronic pancreatitis<pathogen> involves controlling pain , addressing malnutrition via the treatment of vitamin and mineral deficiencies and recognizing the risk of osteoporosis , and administering appropriate pancreatic enzyme supplementation and diabetic agents. Cornerstones in treatment include the recognition of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy , support to cease smoking and alcohol consumption , consultation with a dietitian , and a systematic follow-up to assure optimal treatment effect.
