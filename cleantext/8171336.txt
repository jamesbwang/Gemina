  A new technique is proposed to transport and further classify nanoparticles of different sizes. A graphene sheet is used as the substrate; a nanoparticle is placed on the substrate and a sliding block is located below the substrate. As the sliding block moves under the graphene substrate , a driving force is yielded from the van der Waals interaction between the sliding block and the nanoparticle. The effects of the pre-tension of the graphene substrate , size and number of layers of the nanoparticle , slip velocity , the interface commensurability and temperature on nanoparticle transportation are systematically investigated. It is found that a pre-tensioned graphene substrate could provide easier nanoparticle transport. The initial movement of the nanoparticle depends on the competition between the in-plane force and the driving force , while the subsequent transport depends on the slip velocity of the sliding block and the viscous damping force. Based on such a new transport mechanism , a novel nano-sieve can be designed , with which nanoparticles of different sizes can be screened and classified spontaneously. Our findings may be useful for promising designs of transportation , manipulation and classification of nanoparticles.
