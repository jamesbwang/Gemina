  Human voices are extremely variable: The same person can sound very different depending on whether they are speaking , laughing , shouting or whispering. In order to successfully recognise someone from their voice , a listener needs to be able to generalize across these different vocal signals ( ` telling people together '). However , in most studies of voice-identity processing to date , the substantial within-person variability has been eliminated through the use of highly controlled stimuli , thus focussing on how we tell people apart. We argue that this obscures our understanding of voice-identity processing by controlling away an essential feature of vocal stimuli that may include diagnostic information. In this paper , we propose that we need to extend the focus of voice-identity research to account for both `` telling people together '' as well as `` telling people apart. '' That is , we must account for whether , and to what extent , listeners can overcome within-person variability to obtain a stable percept of person identity from vocal cues. To do this , our theoretical and methodological frameworks need to be adjusted to explicitly include the study of within-person variability.
