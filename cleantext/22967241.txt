  The properties of aqueous solutions of ionic , zwitterionic , and polar solutes are of interest to many fields. For instance , one of the many anomalous properties of aqueous solutions is the behavior of water diffusion in different monovalent salt solutions. In addition , solutes can affect the stabilities of macromolecules such as proteins in aqueous solution. Here , the diffusivities of aqueous solutions of sodium chloride , potassium chloride , tri-methylamine oxide ( TMAO) , urea , and TMAO-urea are examined in molecular dynamics simulations. The decrease in the diffusivity of water with the concentration of simple ions and urea can be described by a simple model in which the water molecules hydrogen bonded to the solutes are considered to diffuse at the same rate as the solutes , while the remainder of the water molecules are considered to be bulk and diffuse at almost the same rate as pure water. On the other hand , the decrease in the diffusivity of water with the concentration of TMAO is apparently affected by a decrease in the diffusion rate of the bulk water molecules in addition to the decrease due to the water molecules hydrogen bonded to TMAO. In other words , TMAO enhances the viscosity of water , while urea barely affects it. Overall , this separation of water molecules into those that are hydrogen bonded to solute and those that are bulk can provide a useful means of understanding the short- and long-range effects of solutes on water.
