  Methyltransferase G9a is essential for a key gene silencing mark , histone H3 dimethylation at lysine-9 ( H3K9me2). Hepatic G9a expression is down-regulated by xenobiotics and diabetes. However , little is known about the role of G9a in liver. Thus , we generated mice with liver-specific knockout ( Liv-KO) of G9a. Adult G9a Liv-KO mice had marked loss of H3K9me2 proteins in liver , without overt liver injury or infiltration of inflammatory cells. However , G9a-null livers had ectopic induction of certain genes normally expressed in neural and immune systems. Additionally , G9a-null livers had moderate down-regulation of cytoprotective genes , markedly altered expression of certain important drug-processing genes , elevated endogenous reactive oxygen species , induction of ER stress marker Chop , but decreased glutathione and nuclear Nrf2. microRNA-383 , a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway , was strongly induced in G9a Liv-KO mice. After LPS treatment , G9a Liv-KO mice had aggravated lipid peroxidation and proinflammatory response. Taken together , the present study demonstrates that G9a regulates liver maturation by silencing neural and proinflammatory genes but maintaining/activating cytoprotective and drug-processing genes , in which the G9a/miR -383/ PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 ( Chop) pathways may play important roles. G9a deficiency due to genetic polymorphism and/or environmental exposure may alter xenobiotic metabolism and aggravate inflammation<symptom> and liver dysfunction.
