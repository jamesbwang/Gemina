  Double stranded RNAs ( dsRNA) degrading nuclease is responsible for the rapid degradation of dsRNA molecules , and thus accounts for variations in RNA interference ( RNAi) efficacy among insect species. Here , the biochemical properties and tissue-specific activities of dsRNA degrading nucleases in four insects (
