  In this work , quaternary CdZnTeS quantum dots ( QDs) with a particularly strong electrochemiluminescence ( ECL) were synthesized as ECL signal labels. The strong ECL signals can be obtained at both cathode and anode with the ECL efficiencies of 19.78 % and 1.62 % , respectively. The sandwich-structured ECL immunosensors for the detection of alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP) and cancer antigen 125 ( CA125) were accomplished with direct ECL image analysis. Under optimal conditions , the QDs-based ECL image immunoanalysis possessed good linearity from 0.5 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL for AFP and from 20 U/mL to 500 U/mL for CA125 with the detection limit of 0.1 ng/mL and 6 U/mL , respectively ( S/N = 3) , and the lower detection limit obtained by photomultiplier tube were 0.1 fg/mL for AFP and 0.03 mU/mL for CA125 with the wide dynamic range from 0.5 fg/mL to 20 ng/mL and from 0.1 mU/mL to 500 U/mL , respectively ( S/N = 3). Furthermore , the ECL immunoanalysis was evaluated with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in human serum samples. The good results indicated that CdZnTeS QDs-based ECL biosensor has great potential for fast biomedical screening and multi-assays in clinical diagnosis.
