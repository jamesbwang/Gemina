  Research on orphan crops is often hindered by a lack of genomic resources. With the advent of affordable sequencing technologies , genotyping an entire genome or , for large-genome species , a representative fraction of the genome has become feasible for any crop. Nevertheless , most genotyping-by-sequencing ( GBS) methods are geared towards obtaining large numbers of markers at low sequence depth , which excludes their application in heterozygous individuals. Furthermore , bioinformatics pipelines often lack the flexibility to deal with paired-end reads or to be applied in polyploid species. UGbS-Flex combines publicly available software with in-house python and perl scripts to efficiently call SNPs from genotyping-by-sequencing reads irrespective of the species ' ploidy level , breeding system and availability of a reference genome. Noteworthy features of the UGbS-Flex pipeline are an ability to use paired-end reads as input , an effective approach to cluster reads across samples with enhanced outputs , and maximization of SNP calling. We demonstrate use of the pipeline for the identification of several thousand high-confidence SNPs with high representation across samples in an F The paper combines GBS protocol modifications , a novel flexible GBS analysis pipeline , UGbS-Flex , recommendations to maximize SNP identification , updated genetic mapping software , and the first high-density maps of finger millet. The modules used in the UGbS-Flex pipeline and for genetic mapping were applied to finger millet , an allotetraploid selfing species without a reference genome , as a case study. The UGbS-Flex modules , which can be run independently , are easily transferable to species with other breeding systems or ploidy levels.
