  This study focuses on life experiences and social representations related to gender in the context of health among young French lay people aged from 18 to 21 years ( N = 47). Qualitative analysis of the discursive content of nine focus groups illuminated the lay thinking underlying gender issues in the health context. Broadly speaking , group composition ( i.e. unisex , mixed) had an impact on participants ' discourse construction. Through their discourses , participants came to ` naturalise ' the health issues and practices of each sex/gender through the biological specificities of men and women. In addition , discourse content underscores a differentiated ` imperative of health '.
