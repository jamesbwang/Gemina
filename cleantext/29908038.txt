  The aim of this randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study was to evaluate if downregulation of the inflammatory response due to ingestion of high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA) can slow down gingivitis<disease> development , and thus delay the progression of periodontal<disease> disease<disease> ( PD) in dogs. To this aim , 44 client-owned adult dogs ( > 1 and < 8 years old) with naturally occurring PD ( stages 1 and 2) were submitted to a plaque , gingivitis<disease> and calculus scoring followed by a dental cleaning procedure and collection of blood samples. The animals were then fed a canine adult maintenance diet , supplemented with either corn oil ( 0.00 g EPA and 0.00 g DHA) or fish oil ( 1.53 g EPA and 0.86 g DHA , both per 1,000 kcal ME) over the following 5 months. At the end of this period , the PD scoring and the blood sampling were repeated. The animals consuming fish oil had higher plasma levels of the longer chain ( C â‰¥ 20) omega 3 fatty acids ( p < 0.01) and similar plasma levels of alpha-linolenic acid ( p = 0.53) , omega 6 fatty acids ( p > 0.63) and C reactive protein ( p = 0.28) then the ones consuming corn oil. There were no differences between fish oil and corn oil diet supplementation on plaque ( 18.2 vs. 17.8 , p = 0.78) , calculus ( 10.1 vs. 11.5 , p = 0.18) or gingivitis<disease> ( 19.3 vs. 19.0 , p = 0.77) indexes. The authors conclude that supplementation with EPA + DHA does not slow down progression of PD in dogs.
