  Two important stimulus features represented within the rodent barrel cortex are velocity and angular direction of whisker deflection. Each cortical barrel receives information from thalamocortical ( TC) cells that relay information from a single whisker , and TC input is decoded by barrel regular-spiking ( RS) cells through a feedforward inhibitory architecture ( with inhibition delivered by cortical fast-spiking or FS cells). TC cells encode deflection velocity through population synchrony , while deflection direction is encoded through the distribution of spike counts across the TC population. Barrel RS cells encode both deflection direction and velocity with spike rate , and are divided into functional domains by direction preference. Following repetitive whisker stimulation , system adaptation causes a weakening of synaptic inputs to RS cells and diminishes RS cell spike responses , though evidence suggests that stimulus discrimination may improve following adaptation. In this work , I construct a model of the TC , FS , and RS cells comprising a single barrel system-the model incorporates realistic synaptic connectivity and dynamics and simulates both angular direction ( through the spatial pattern of TC activation) and velocity ( through synchrony of the TC population spikes) of a deflection of the primary whisker , and I use the model to examine direction and velocity selectivity of barrel RS cells before and after adaptation. I find that velocity and direction selectivity of individual RS cells ( measured over multiple trials) sharpens following adaptation , but stimulus discrimination using a simple linear classifier by the RS population response during a single trial ( a more biologically meaningful measure than single cell discrimination over multiple trials) exhibits strikingly different behavior-velocity discrimination is similar both before and after adaptation , while direction classification improves substantially following adaptation. This is the first model , to my knowledge , that simulates both whisker deflection velocity and angular direction and examines the ability of the RS population response to pinpoint both stimulus features within the context of adaptation.
