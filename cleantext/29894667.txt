  Endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC) dysfunction contributes to diabetes-induced delay in endothelium repair after vessel injury , prominently associated with diabetic cardiovascular complications such as neointima formation. ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 ( ABCG1) promotes cholesterol efflux to HDL , which may favorably affect EPC function. However , whether ABCG1 improves EPC function , especially in diabetes , remains unknown. Here we investigated the role of ABCG1 in EPCs by using Tie2-mediated ABCG1 transgenic ( Tie2- ABCG1
