  The extant diversity and rich fossil record of cetaceans provides an extraordinary evolutionary context for investigating the relationship between form , function and ecology. The transition from terrestrial to marine ecosystems is associated with a complex suite of morphological and physiological adaptations that were required for a fully aquatic mammalian life history. Two specific functional innovations that characterize the two great clades of cetaceans , echolocation in toothed whales ( Odontoceti) and filter feeding in baleen whales ( Mysticeti) , provide a powerful comparative framework for integrative studies. Both clades exhibit gigantism in multiple species , but we posit that large body size may have evolved for different reasons and in response to different ecosystem conditions. Although these foraging adaptations have been studied using a combination of experimental and tagging studies , the precise functional drivers and consequences of morphological change within and among these lineages remain less understood. Future studies that focus at the interface of physiology , ecology and paleontology will help elucidate how cetaceans became the largest predators in aquatic ecosystems worldwide.
