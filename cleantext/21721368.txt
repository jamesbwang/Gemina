  Concern about side effects and health issues are common reasons for contraceptive non-use or discontinuation. Contraceptive-induced menstrual bleeding changes ( CIMBCs) are linked to these concerns. Research on women 's responses to CIMBCs has not been mapped or summarized in a systematic scoping review. We conducted a systematic scoping review of data on women 's responses to CIMBCs in peer-reviewed , English-language publications in the last 15 years. Investigator dyads abstracted information from relevant studies on pre-specified and emergent themes using a standardized form. We held an expert consultation to obtain critical input. We provide recommendations for researchers , contraceptive counselors , and product developers. We identified 100 relevant studies. All world regions were represented ( except Antarctica) , including Africa ( 11 %) , the Americas ( 32 %) , Asia ( 7 %) , Europe ( 20 %) , and Oceania ( 6 %). We summarize findings pertinent to five thematic areas: women 's responses to contraceptive-induced non-standard bleeding patterns; CIMBCs influence on non-use , dissatisfaction or discontinuation; conceptual linkages between CIMBCs and health; women 's responses to menstrual suppression; and other emergent themes. Women 's preferences for non-monthly bleeding patterns ranged widely , though amenorrhea appears most acceptable in the Americas and Europe. Multiple studies reported CIMBCs as top reasons for contraceptive dissatisfaction and discontinuation; others suggested disruption of regular bleeding patterns was associated with non-use. CIMBCs in some contexts were perceived as linked with a wide range of health concerns; e.g. , some women perceived amenorrhea to cause a buildup of `` dirty '' or `` blocked '' blood , in turn perceived as causing blood clots , fibroids , emotional disturbances , weight gain , infertility<symptom> , or death. Multiple studies addressed how CIMBCs ( or menstruation) impacted daily activities , including participation in domestic , work , school , sports , or religious life; sexual or emotional relationships; and other domains. Substantial variability exists around how women respond to CIMBCs; these responses are shaped by individual and social influences. Despite variation in responses across contexts and sub-populations , CIMBCs can impact multiple aspects of women 's lives. Women 's responses to CIMBCs should be recognized as a key issue in contraceptive research , counseling , and product development , but may be underappreciated , despite likely- and potentially substantial- impacts on contraceptive discontinuation and unmet need for modern contraception.
