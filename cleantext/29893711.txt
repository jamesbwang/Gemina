  Deep brain stimulation ( DBS) generates action potentials ( APs) in presynaptic axons and fibers of passage. The APs may be antidromically propagated to invade the cell body and/or orthodromically transmitted to downstream structures , thereby affecting widespread targets distant from the electrode. Activation of presynaptic terminals also causes trans-synaptic effects , which in turn alter the excitability of the post-synaptic neurons. Our aim was to determine how synaptic inputs affect the antidromic invasion of the cell body. We used a biophysically-based multi-compartment model to simulate antidromic APs in thalamocortical relay ( TC) neurons. We applied distributed synaptic inputs to the model and quantified how excitatory and inhibitory inputs contributed to the fidelity of antidromic activation over a range of antidromic frequencies. Antidromic activation exhibited strong frequency dependence , which arose from the hyperpolarizing afterpotentials in the cell body and its respective recovery cycle. Low-frequency axonal spikes faithfully invaded the soma , whereas frequent failures of antidromic activation occurred at high frequencies. The frequency-dependent pattern of the antidromic activation masked burst-driver inputs to TC neurons from the cerebellum in a frequency-dependent manner. Antidromic activation also depended on the excitability of the cell body. Excitatory synaptic inputs improved the fidelity of antidromic activation by increasing the excitability , and inhibitory inputs suppressed antidromic activation by reducing soma excitability. Stimulus-induced depolarization of neuronal segments also facilitated antidromic propagation and activation. The results reveal that synaptic inputs , stimulus frequency , and electrode position regulate antidromic activation of the cell body during extracellular stimulation. These findings provide a biophysical basis for interpreting the widespread inhibition/activation of target nuclei during DBS.
