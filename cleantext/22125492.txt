  TALE factors are broadly expressed embryonically and known to function in complexes with transcription factors ( TFs) like Hox proteins at gastrula/segmentation stages , but it is unclear if such generally expressed factors act by the same mechanism throughout embryogenesis. We identify a TALE-dependent gene regulatory network ( GRN) required for anterior development and detect TALE occupancy associated with this GRN throughout embryogenesis. At blastula stages , we uncover a novel functional mode for TALE factors , where they occupy genomic DECA motifs with nearby NF-Y sites. We demonstrate that TALE and NF-Y form complexes and regulate chromatin state at genes of this GRN. At segmentation stages , GRN-associated TALE occupancy expands to include HEXA motifs near PBX: HOX sites. Hence , TALE factors control a key GRN , but utilize distinct DNA motifs and protein partners at different stages- a strategy that may also explain their oncogenic potential and may be employed by other broadly expressed TFs.
