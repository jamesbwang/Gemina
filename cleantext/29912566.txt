  In the present study , tissue distribution and the therapeutic effect of topically applied cyclosporine A ( CsA)- loaded methoxy-poly ( ethylene-glycol)- hexyl substituted poly ( lactic acid) ( mPEGhexPLA) nanocarriers ( ApidSOL) on experimental autoimmune uveitis ( EAU) were investigated. The CsA-loaded mPEGhexPLA nanocarrier was tolerated well locally and showed no signs of immediate toxicity after repeated topical application in mice with EAU. Upon unilateral CsA treatment , CsA accumulated predominantly in the corneal and sclera-choroidal tissue of the treated eye and in lymph nodes ( LN). This regimen reduced EAU severity in treated eyes compared to PBS-treated controls. This improvement was accompanied by reduced T-cell count , T-cell proliferation , and IL-2 secretion of cells from ipsilateral LN. In conclusion , topical treatment with CsA-loaded mPEGhexPLA nanocarriers significantly improves the outcome of EAU.
