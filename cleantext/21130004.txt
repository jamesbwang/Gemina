  Type I interferon ( IFN-I) responses are critical for the control of RNA virus infections , however , many viruses , including Dengue ( DENV<pathogen>) and Chikungunya ( CHIKV) virus<pathogen> , do not directly activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDCs) , robust IFN-I producing cells. Herein , we demonstrated that DENV<pathogen> and CHIKV infected cells are sensed by pDCs , indirectly , resulting in selective IRF7 activation and IFN-I production , in the absence of other inflammatory cytokine responses. To elucidate pDC immunomodulatory functions , we developed a mouse model in which IRF7 signaling is restricted to pDC. Despite undetectable levels of IFN-I protein , pDC-restricted IRF7 signaling controlled both viruses and was sufficient to protect mice from lethal CHIKV infection. Early pDC IRF7-signaling resulted in amplification of downstream antiviral responses , including an accelerated natural killer ( NK) cell-mediated type II IFN response. These studies revealed the dominant , yet indirect role of pDC IRF7-signaling in directing both type I and II IFN responses during arbovirus infections.
