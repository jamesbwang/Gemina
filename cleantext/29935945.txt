  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP) benefits , which are distributed monthly , help low-income families put food on their tables. Both food spending and caloric intake among recipients decrease over the month following benefit receipt. This pattern , termed the `` SNAP-cycle , '' has serious implications for health and food security of low-income households. To understand better the SNAP-cycle , this study explored ( 1) differences in diet quality between SNAP and non-SNAP households and ( 2) the association between the SNAP-cycle and diet quality. Multivariate linear regression with SNAP households in the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey to evaluate changes in diet quality as time from SNAP distribution increased. Diet quality of food purchases was measured by Healthy Eating Index-2010 total and component scores. Data were collected 2012-2013 and analyzed 2016-2017. Overall dietary quality was low throughout the SNAP-cycle ( n = 1,377 , mean Healthy Eating Index 46.14 of 100). SNAP households had significantly lower Healthy Eating Index scores compared with eligible and ineligible nonparticipants ( p < 0.05). After controlling for covariates , households in the final 10 days of the benefit cycle had Healthy Eating Index-2010 total scores 2.95 points lower than all other SNAP households ( p = 0.02). Significant declines in Healthy Eating Index fruit and vegetable scores contributed to worsening diet quality over the SNAP-cycle. This study provides evidence of low dietary quality throughout the SNAP-cycle with significantly lower Healthy Eating Index scores in the final 10 days of the benefit month. This suggests less healthy purchasing occurs when resources are diminished , but overall that current SNAP levels are insufficient to consistently purchase foods according to dietary guidelines.
