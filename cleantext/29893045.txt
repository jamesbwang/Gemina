  We examined the knowledge , attitudes , and practices of primary care doctors in Ulaanbaatar , Mongolia using a recently developed World Hypertension League survey. The survey was administered as part of a quality assurance initiative to enhance hypertension control. A total of 577 surveys were distributed and 467 were completed ( 81 % response rate). The respondents had an average age of 35 years and 90.1 % were female. Knowledge of hypertension epidemiology was low ( 13.5 % of questions answered correctly); 31 % of clinical practice questions had correct answers and confidence in performing specific tasks to improve hypertension control had 63.2 % `` desirable/correct '' answers. Primary care doctors mostly had a positive attitude toward hypertension management ( 76.5 % desirable/correct answers) and highly prioritized hypertension management activities ( 85.7 % desirable/correct answers). Some important highlights included the majority ( > 80 %) overestimating hypertension awareness , treatment , and control rates; 78.2 % used aneroid blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> manometers; 15 % systematically screened adults for hypertension in their clinics; 21.8 % reported 2 or more drugs were required to control hypertension in most people; and 16.1 % reported most people could be controlled by lifestyle changes alone. 55 % of respondents were not comfortable prescribing more than 1 or 2 antihypertensive drugs in a patient and the percentage of desirable/correct responses to treating various high-risk patients was low. Most ( 53 % -74 %) supported task shifting to nonphysician health care providers except for drug prescribing , which only 13.9 % supported. A hypertension clinical education program is currently being designed based on the specific needs identified in the survey.
