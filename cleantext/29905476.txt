  Hemoproteins have recently emerged as promising biocatalysts for promoting a variety of carbene transfer reactions including cyclopropanation and Y-H insertion ( Y = N , S , Si , B). For these and synthetic carbene transfer catalysts alike , achieving high chemoselectivity toward cyclopropanation in olefin substrates bearing unprotected Y-H groups has proven remarkably challenging due to competition from the more facile carbene Y-H insertion reaction. In this report , we describe the development of a novel artificial metalloenzyme based on an engineered myoglobin incorporating a serine-ligated Co-porphyrin cofactor that is capable of offering high selectivity toward olefin cyclopropanation over N-H and Si-H insertion. Intramolecular competition experiments revealed a distinct and dramatically altered chemoselectivity of the Mb ( H64V , V68A , H93S) ( Co ( ppIX)) variant in carbene transfer reactions compared to myoglobin-based variants containing the native histidine-ligated heme cofactor or other metal/proximal ligand substitutions. These studies highlight the functional plasticity of myoglobin as a `` carbene transferase '' and illustrate how modulation of the cofactor environment within this metalloprotein scaffold represents a valuable strategy for accessing carbene transfer reactivity not exhibited by naturally occurring hemoproteins or transition metal catalysts.
