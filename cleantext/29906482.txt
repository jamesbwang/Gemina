  Attentional bias ( sensitization) for negative information was estimated using event-related brain potentials ( ERP). We used a three-stimulus visual oddball paradigm that comprised a small diamond standard stimulus ( 66.7 %) , a large diamond target stimulus ( 16.7 %) , and deviant word stimuli ( 16.7 %) written in Kanji. Furthermore , half the deviant words were negative emotional words ( e.g. , destruction or scream) and the others half were neutral words ( e.g. , structure or range). Healthy participants ( N = 26) were instructed to press a button after the target appeared while ignoring the other stimuli. EEG was recorded from Fz , Cz , and Pz sites and the average of EEG that time-locked to the onset of stimuli was calculated. Results indicated that the P3 amplitude for the target at Pz was the largest among the three sites , whereas the P3 amplitude for deviant words at Cz and Pz was larger than those at Fz. Furthermore , the P3 amplitudes for negative words increased in comparison to those for neutral words. These results suggest that increased amplitudes to word stimuli are regarded as deviant P3 , and changes reflect passive attentional capture elicited by negative emotional information. Implications for using ERPs for estimating attentional bias to threat information are discussed.
