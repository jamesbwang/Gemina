  During a recent study on the sequencing data of our database between 2012 and 2016 in Southwestern France , we observed that 8 patients harbored what seemed to be the same virus. Indeed , routine genotyping at the time of HIV<pathogen> diagnosis showed that protease ( Prot) and reverse transcriptase ( RT) were related to CRF06_cpx and subtype B , respectively. The integrase ( INT) sequences ( available for 3 patients) were clustering with CRF06_cpx and envelope ( Env) gp120 sequences ( available for 2 patients) with subtype B. Since such a recombinant has not been recorded in the Los Alamos database , we decided to characterize the full-length genome of this virus. The data suggest the identification of a new CRF between CRF06_cpx and subtype B , the structure of which is very complex with multiple breakpoints. We will refer this CRF as CRF98_cpx.
