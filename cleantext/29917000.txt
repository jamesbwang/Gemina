  We pose four questions for the clinician diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma , and supply evidence-based answers. The first question is: `` When do you perform a 10-2 ( 2 ° grid) visual field test? '' We argue the best answer is: anyone you would do , or have done , a 24-2 ( 6 ° grid) visual field on should have both a 24-2 and a 10-2 visual field within the first two visits. Second , `` When do you perform an optical coherence tomography ( OCT) scan of the macula? '' We argue that , if you are performing an OCT test , then it should include both the macula and disc , either as a single scan or as two scans , one centered on the macula and the other on the disc. Third , `` How do you know if the visual field and OCT tests agree? '' The poor answer is , `` I use summary statistics such as 24-2 mean deviation and global or quadrant average of retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL) thickness ''. It is much better to topographically compare abnormal regions on the OCT to abnormal regions on the visual field. Finally , the fourth question is: `` When do you look at OCT images? '' We argue that , at a minimum , the clinician should be directly examining an image of the circumpapillary RNFL , and this image should be sufficiently large and with sufficient resolution so that local damage can be seen , and the segmentation evaluated.
