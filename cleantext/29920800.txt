  Engineering the fluid interface such as the gas-liquid interface is of great significance for solvent processing applications including functional material assembly , inkjet printing , and high-performance device fabrication. However , precisely controlling the fluid interface remains a great challenge owing to its flexibility and fluidity. Here , a general method to manipulate the fluid interface for fluid patterning using micropillars in the microchannel is reported. The principle of fluid patterning for immiscible fluid pairs including air , water , and oils is proposed. This understanding enables the preparation of programmable multiphase fluid patterns and assembly of multilayer functional materials to fabricate micro-optoelectronic devices. This general strategy of fluid patterning provides a promising platform to study the fundamental processes occurring on the fluid interface , and benefits applications in many subjects , such as microfluidics , microbiology , chemical analysis and detection , material synthesis and assembly , device fabrication , etc..
