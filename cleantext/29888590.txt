  Biofilm formation on stainless steel ( SS) surfaces of food-processing plants , leading to food-borne illness outbreaks , is enabled by the attachment and confinement of pathogens within microscale cavities of surface roughness ( grooves , scratches). We report foodsafe oil-based slippery coatings ( FOSCs) for food-processing surfaces that suppress bacterial adherence and biofilm formation by trapping residual oil lubricant within these surface cavities to block microbial growth. SS surfaces were chemically functionalized with alkylphosphonic acid to preferentially wet a layer of food-grade oil. FOSCs reduced the effective surface roughness , the adhesion of organic food residue , and bacteria. FOSCs significantly reduced Pseudomonas<pathogen> aeruginosa<pathogen> biofilm formation on standard roughness SS-316 by 5 log CFU cm
