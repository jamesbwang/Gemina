  The aims of this study were to examine the extent of decisional conflict in end-of-life cancer treatments and to investigate the influences and predictors of decisional conflict among family surrogates. A cross-sectional , descriptive , correlational design was applied. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 102 family members who had participated in end-of-life cancer decision-making. We enrolled participants from inpatient oncology units at a university hospital in South Korea from May 2014 to January 2016. The results indicated that many family surrogates had high levels of decisional conflict and psychological stress after end-of-life cancer decision-making. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that decisional conflict had significant , substantial influences on decision regret and psychological stress after controlling for demographic variables. Family surrogates who were aware of the patients ' wishes about end-of-life treatments and those who had good family functioning had less decisional conflict. To relieve decisional conflict regarding end-of-life cancer treatment among family surrogates , it is necessary to encourage patients to share their end-of-life treatment wishes with family members and to consider family functioning in the end-of-life decision-making process.
