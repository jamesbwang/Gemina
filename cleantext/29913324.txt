  The general public , treatment professionals , and healthcare professionals have been found to exhibit an explicit negative bias towards substance use and individuals with a substance use disorder ( SUD). Terms such as `` substance abuser '' and `` opioid addict '' have shown to elicit greater negative explicit bias. However , other common terms have yet to be empirically studied. 1,288 participants were recruited from ResearchMatch. Participants were assigned into one of seven groups with different hypothesized stigmatizing and non-stigmatizing terms. Participants completed a Go/No Association Task ( GNAT) and vignette-based social distance scale. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were used to analyze the GNAT results , and one-way ANOVAs were used to analyze vignette results. The terms `` substance abuser '' , `` addict '' , `` alcoholic '' , and `` opioid addict '' , were strongly associated with the negative and significantly different from the positive counterterms. `` Relapse '' and `` Recurrence of Use '' were strongly associated with the negative; however , the strength of the `` recurrence of use '' positive association was higher and significantly different from the `` relapse '' positive association. `` Pharmacotherapy '' was strongly associated with the positive and significantly different than `` medication-assisted treatment ''. Both `` medication-assisted recovery '' and `` long-term recovery '' were strongly associated with the positive , and significantly different from the negative association. Results support calls to cease use of the terms `` addict '' , `` alcoholic '' , `` opioid addict '' , and `` substance abuser ''. Additionally , it is suggested that `` recurrence of use '' and `` pharmacotherapy '' be used for their overall positive benefits. Both `` medication-assisted recovery '' and `` long-term recovery '' are positive terms and can be used when applicable without promoting stigma.
