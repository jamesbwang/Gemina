  High-quality large molecular weight genomic DNA is important for genomic studies. Most commercial available genomic DNA purification kits have failed to generate high molecular weight DNA of sufficient quality from planarians. Here , we describe a simple and efficient genomic DNA isolation method , which has worked for several different planarian species , including Schmidtea mediterranea. This phenol-chloroform based method can be used to obtain genomic DNA of up to 150 kb and can be used for bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC) library construction , next-generation sequencing and PCR cloning.
