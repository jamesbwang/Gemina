  The problem of quantifying the overlap of Hutchinsonian niches has received much attention lately , in particular in quantitative ecology , from where it also originates. However , the niche concept has the potential to also be useful in many other application areas , as for example in economics. We are presenting a fully nonparametric , robust solution to this problem , along with exact shortcut formulas based on rank-statistics , and with a rather intuitive probabilistic interpretation. Furthermore , by deriving the asymptotic sampling distribution of the estimators , we are proposing the first asymptotically valid inference method , providing confidence intervals for the niche overlap. The theoretical considerations are supplemented by simulation studies and a real data example.
