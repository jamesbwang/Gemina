  Diabetes has been proposed to be a risk factor for and a consequence of pancreatic cancer ( PC). The relationship between recent-onset diabetes and PC is not well understood , and data in minorities are sparse. We examined the relationships between recent-onset diabetes and PC incidence in African Americans and Latinos in the Multiethnic Cohort. A total of 48 995 African Americans and Latinos without prior diabetes and cancer at baseline ( 1993-1996) were included in the study. Questionnaires , Medicare data , and California hospital discharge files were used to identify new diabetes diagnoses. Cox regressions were used to calculate hazard ratios ( HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) for cancer associated with diabetes and with diabetes duration. A total of 15 833 ( 32.3 %) participants developed diabetes between baseline and 2013. A total of 408 incident PC cases were identified during follow-up. Diabetes was associated with PC ( HRage75 = 2.39 , 95 % CI = 1.91 to 2.98). Individuals with recent-onset diabetes ( within three or fewer years of PC diagnosis) had a greater risk compared with those with long-term diabetes across all ages. The HRage75 for recent-onset diabetes was 4.08 ( 95 % CI = 2.76 to 6.03) in Latinos and 3.38 ( 95 % CI = 2.30 to 4.98) in African Americans. Diabetes was associated with a more than twofold higher risk of PC in African Americans and Latinos , but recent-onset diabetes was associated with a 2.3-fold greater increase in risk of PC than long-standing diabetes. Our findings support the hypothesis that recent-onset diabetes is a manifestation of PC and that long-standing diabetes is a risk factor for this malignancy.
