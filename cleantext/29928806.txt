  We have utilized an approach that integrates molecular dynamics ( MD) simulations with particle swarm optimization ( PSO) to accelerate the development of coarse-grained ( CG) models of hydrocarbons. Specifically , we have developed new transferable CG beads , which can be used to model the hydrocarbons ( C5 to C17) and reproduce their experimental properties with good accuracy. First , the PSO method was used to develop the CG beads of the decane model represented with a 2:1 ( 2-2-2-2-2) mapping scheme. This was followed by the development of the nonane model described with hybrid 2-2-3-2 and 3:1 ( 3-3-3) mapping schemes. The force-field parameters for these three CG models were optimized to reproduce four experimentally observed properties including density , enthalpy of vaporization , surface tension , and self-diffusion coefficient at 300 K. The CG MD simulations conducted with these new CG models of decane and nonane , at different timesteps , for various system sizes , and at a range of different temperatures , were able to predict their density , enthalpy of vaporization , surface tension , self-diffusion coefficient , expansibility , and isothermal compressibility with good accuracy. Moreover , a comparison of structural features obtained from the CG MD simulations and the CG beads of mapped all-atom trajectories of decane and nonane showed very good agreement. To test the chemical transferability of these models , we have constructed the models for hydrocarbons ranging from pentane to heptadecane , by using different combinations of the CG beads of decane and nonane. The properties of pentane to heptadecane predicted by these new CG models showed excellent agreement with the experimental data.
