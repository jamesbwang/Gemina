  With the development of nanotechnology , nanomaterials have been widely applied in anti-bacterial coating , electronic device , and personal care products. NanoZnO is one of the most used materials and its ecotoxicity has been extensively studied. To explore the potential phototoxicity of nanoZnO induced by visible light , we conducted a long-term experiment on litter decomposition of Typha angustifolia leaves with assessment of fungal multifaceted natures. After 158 d exposure , the decomposition rate of leaf litter was decreased by nanoZnO but no additional effect by visible light. However , visible light enhanced the inhibitory effect of nanoZnO on fungal sporulation rate due to light-induced dissolution of nanoZnO. On the contrary , enzymes such as Î²-glucosidase , cellobiohydrolase , and leucine-aminopeptidase were significantly increased by the interaction of nanoZnO and visible light , which led to high efficiency of leaf carbon decomposition. Furthermore , different treatments and exposure time separated fungal community associated with litter decomposition. Therefore , the study provided the evidence of the contribution of visible light to nanoparticle phototoxicity at the ecosystem level.
