  Moyamoya disease ( MMD) management during pregnancy poses a challenge to health care providers , and recommendations are outdated , vague , and controversial. We conducted a systematic review to investigate and present the available evidence. We searched five online databases and bibliographies of relevant published original studies to identify case reports , case series , cohort studies , and reviews reporting on patients diagnosed with MMD before , during , or shortly after pregnancy. We report and analyze the respective data. Fifty-four relevant articles were identified. In the group of patients with MMD diagnosed prior to pregnancy , 68.7 % had previously undergone bypass surgery , 64.5 % delivered via cesarean section , 95.2 % of mothers had good outcomes , and no bad fetal outcomes were reported. In patients first diagnosed with MMD due to a cerebrovascular accident during pregnancy , the mean gestational age on symptom onset was 28.7 weeks and 69.5 % presented with cerebral hemorrhage<symptom>. In this group , 57.2 % received neurosurgical operative management , and 80 % underwent cesarean section with 13.6 % maternal mortality and 23.5 % fetal demise. In patients diagnosed with MMD immediately postpartum , 46.6 % suffered a cerebrovascular event within 3 days of delivery , 78.3 % of which were ischemic. Only 15.3 % underwent surgical hematoma evacuation and one patient ( 9 %) expired. MMD may coincide with pregnancy , but there is paucity of high-quality data. It appears that MMD is not a contraindication to pregnancy , if blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and ventilation are properly managed. There is no clear evidence that bypass surgery before pregnancy or cesarean mode of delivery improve outcomes.
