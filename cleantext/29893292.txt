  The use of tetrahedral-based phantoms in conjunction with Monte Carlo dose calculation techniques has shown high capabilities in radiation therapy. However , the generation of a precise dose distribution can be very time-consuming since a fine tetrahedral mesh is required. In this work , we propose a new method that defines the density distribution of patient-specific tetrahedral phantoms , based upon the CT-scans and the direction of the particle beam. The final purpose is to coarsen the tetrahedral mesh to improve computational performance in Monte Carlo simulations while guaranteeing a precise dose distribution in the target volume. Contrarily to the state of the art methods that calculate the density value of a tetrahedron , locally based only on the CT-scans , our approach also takes into account the direction of the beam to minimize the error of the water equivalent thickness of the tetrahedrons before the tumor volume. In this study , the experiments carried out on a multi-layer computational phantom , and a thorax geometry , show that by applying our method on a coarse mesh , we offer a better dose distribution inside the tumor compared to other density mapping methods , in the same level of detail. This is due to the reduction of the water equivalent path length error from 9.65 mm to 0.62 mm in the case of the multi-layer phantom , and from 2.42 mm to 0.48 mm for the thorax geometry. Moreover , a similar dose coverage is obtained with refined tetrahedral meshes. As a consequence of the reduction of the number of tetrahedrons , computational time is found to be 25 % shorter than both the refined tetrahedral mesh and the voxel-based structure in most cases. Using a coarse tetrahedral mesh to have accurate dose distributions on a given target is feasible as long as the water equivalent path length in the direction of the beam is respected.
