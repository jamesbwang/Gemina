  Thirteen ( Z) -4- ( substituted benzylidene) -3-phenylisoxazol-5 ( 4H)- ones were designed to confirm the geometric effect of the double bond of the β-phenyl-α , β-unsaturated carbonyl scaffold on tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Compounds 1a-1m , which all possessed the ( Z)- β-phenyl-α , β-unsaturated carbonyl scaffold , were synthesized using a tandem reaction consisting of an isoxazolone ring formation and a Knoevenagel condensation , and three starting materials , ethyl benzoylacetate , hydroxylamine and benzaldehydes. Some of the compounds showed inhibitory activity against mushroom tyrosinase as potent as compounds containing the '' ( E) ''- β-phenyl-α , β-unsaturated carbonyl scaffold. Compounds 1c and 1m showed greater inhibitory activity than kojic acid: IC
