  Black phosphorus ( BP) possesses unique physical properties and , owing to its intrinsic instability , the proper surface and chemical coordination is the key point in many applications. Herein , a facile and efficient surface lanthanide-coordination strategy based on lanthanide ( Ln) sulfonate complexes is designed to passivate and functionalize different BP-based nanostructures including quantum dots , nanosheets , and microflakes. By means of Ln-P coordination , the lone-pair electrons of phosphorus are occupied , thus preventing oxidation of BP , and the LnL
