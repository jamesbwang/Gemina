  Patients with liver cirrhosis are susceptible to fungal infections. Due to low sensitivity of culture-based methods , we applied a real-time PCR assay targeting the 18S rRNA gene in combination with direct sequencing and terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( T-RFLP) in order to establish a novel tool to detect fungal DNA and to quantify and differentiate Candida<pathogen> DNA , also in polyfungal specimens. In total , 281 samples ( blood n = 135 , ascites n = 92 , duodenal fluid n = 54) from 135 patients with liver cirrhosis and 52 samples ( blood n = 26 , duodenal fluid n = 26) from 26 control patients were collected prospectively. Candida<pathogen> DNA was quantified in all samples. Standard microbiological culture was performed for comparison. Blood and ascites samples , irrespective of the patient cohort , showed a method-independent low fungal detection rate of approximately 1 % , and the Candida<pathogen> DNA content level did not exceed 3.0 x101 copies ml-1 in any sample. In contrast , in duodenal fluid of patients with liver cirrhosis high fungal detection rates were discovered by using both PCR- and culture-based techniques ( 81.5 % vs. 66.7 %; p = 0.123) and the median level of Candida DNA was 3.8 x105 copies ml-1 ( 2.3x102-6.3 x109). In cirrhosis and controls , fungal positive culture results were confirmed by PCR in 96 % and an additional amount of 44 % of culture negative duodenal samples were PCR positive. Using T-RFLP analysis in duodenal samples , overall 85 % of results from microbial culture were confirmed and in 75 % of culture-negative but PCR-positive samples additional Candida<pathogen> species could be identified. In conclusion , PCR-based methods and subsequent differentiation of Candida DNA might offer a quick approach to identifying Candida species without prior cultivation.
