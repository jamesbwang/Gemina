  While global deforestation induced by human land use has been quantified , the drivers and extent of simultaneous woody plant encroachment ( WPE) into open areas are only regionally known. WPE has important consequences for ecosystem functioning , global carbon balances<symptom> and human economies. Here we report , using high-resolution satellite imagery , that woody vegetation cover over sub-Saharan Africa increased by 8 % over the past three decades and that a diversity of drivers , other than CO
