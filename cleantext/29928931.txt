  Oxytocin ( OT) has gained attention not only as anxiolytic drug and as potential treatment option for autistic children; it also acts as a growth and differentiation factor in neuronal cells. While behavioral effects of OT have been studied in detail , knowledge about the cellular effects of OT is relatively sparse. In this study , we present evidence for three hypotheses: 1) OT leads to neurite retraction in hypothalamic neurons via the OT receptor ( OTR) 2) The transcription factor MEF-2A is a central regulator of OT-induced neurite retraction , and 3) The MAPK pathway is critical for OT-induced MEF-2A activation. Incubation of rat hypothalamic H32 cells with 10 nM to 1 Î¼M OT , vasopressin , and the specific OTR agonist TGOT , over the course of 12 h resulted in a time-dependent , significant retraction of neurites. In addition , the size of the nuclear compartment increased , whereas the overall cell size remained unchanged. OT treatment for 10 h increased the cellular viability significantly , and this effect could be blocked by a specific OTR antagonist , providing evidence for a specific and pro-active effect of OT on neurite retraction , and not as an unspecific side effect of apoptosis. The molecular mechanism that controls OT-induced neurite retraction includes a reduced phosphorylation of the transcription factor MEF-2A at Serine 408 ( S408). This dephosphorylation is under the control of the OTR-coupled MAPK pathway , as blocking MEK1/2 by U0126 inhibited MEF-2A activation and subsequent neurite retraction. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of MEF-2A prevented the OT-induced neurite retraction , providing direct evidence for a role of MEF-2A in morphological alterations induced by OT treatment. In summary , the present study reveals a previously unknown OTR-coupled MAPK-MEF-2A pathway , which is responsible for OT-induced neurite retraction of hypothalamic neurons.
