  Satellite observations have transformed our understanding of the Antarctic cryosphere. The continent holds the vast majority of Earth 's fresh water , and blankets swathes of the Southern Hemisphere in ice. Reductions in the thickness and extent of floating ice shelves have disturbed inland ice , triggering retreat , acceleration and drawdown of marine-terminating glaciers. The waxing and waning of Antarctic sea ice is one of Earth 's greatest seasonal habitat changes , and although the maximum extent of the sea ice has increased modestly since the 1970s , inter-annual variability is high , and there is evidence of longer-term decline in its extent.
