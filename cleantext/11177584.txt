  We aimed at assessing the basic coagulation parameters of HIV-infected adults at the University of Gondar Hospital antiretroviral therapy clinic. A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted from February to May 2017. A total of 300 study participants , consisting of 100 HAART-naïve HIV-infected adults , 100 HIV-infected adults who were taking HAART , and 100 HIV-seronegative apparently healthy adults , were included. Basic coagulation functional assays such as PT , APTT , and INR were determined by coagulation analyzer. CD4 cells and platelet count were analyzed by FACS count and SYSMEX K-21N automated analyzer , respectively. The data were entered , cleaned , and edited using Epi Info version 7 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Kruskal-Wallis H , Dunn-Bonferroni pairwise comparison test , and Spearman 's rank-order correlation analysis were used for inferential statistics. The results were expressed by a median and presented in tables. PT , APTT , and INR were significantly higher , whereas platelet count was significantly lower in HIV-infected adults ( both who were taking HAART and HAART-naïve) than HIV-seronegative adults ( HIV-infected adults are more likely to develop coagulation abnormality than HIV-seronegative subjects. Coagulation parameters need to be checked regularly to monitor coagulation disorders in HIV-infected adults.
