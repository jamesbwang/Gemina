  Posttranslational modifications of cysteine ( Cys) residues represent a major aspect of redox biology , and their reliable detection is key in providing mechanistic insights. The metastable character of these modifications and cell lysis-induced artifactual oxidation render current state-of-the-art protocols to rely on alkylation-based stabilization of labile Cys derivatives before cell/tissue rupture. An untested assumption in these procedures is that for all Cys derivatives alkylation rates are faster than their dynamic interchange. However , when the interconversion of Cys derivatives is not rate-limiting , then electrophilic labeling is under Curtin-Hammett control and hence the final alkylated mixture may not represent the speciation that prevailed before alkylation. We here present evidence that in the majority of cases , the speciation of alkylated polysulfide/thiol derivatives indeed depends on the experimental conditions. Our results reveal that alkylation perturbs sulfur speciation in both a concentration- and time-dependent manner , and that strong alkylating agents can cleave polysulfur chains. Moreover , we show that labeling of sulfenic acids with dimedone also affects Cys speciation , suggesting that part of the endogenous pool of products previously believed to represent sulfenic acid species may in fact represent polysulfides. These observations were obtained using buffered aqueous solutions of inorganic- , organic- , cysteine- , glutathione- and GAPDH-polysulfide species. Additional experiments in human plasma and serum revealed that monobromobimane can extract sulfide from the endogenous sulfur pool by shifting speciation equilibria , suggesting caution should be exercised when interpreting experimental results using this tool. We highlight methodological caveats potentially arising from these pitfalls and conclude that current derivatization strategies often fail to adequately capture physiologic speciation of sulfur species.
