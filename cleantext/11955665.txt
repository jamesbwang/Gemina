  Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract ( GSPE) has been extensively reported to possess a wide range of beneficial properties in multiple tissue damage. Previous studies have shown that exhaustive exercise-induced fatigue<symptom> associates with oxidative stress injury , inflammatory response , and mitochondrial dysfunction. The aim of this study is to investigate the anti-fatigue effects of GSPE in mice and explore its possible underlying mechanism. The mouse model of exhaustive exercise-induced fatigue<symptom> was established by using the forced swimming test , and GSPE was orally treated for successive 28 days at 0 , 1 , 50 and 100 mg/kg/day of body<symptom> weight , designated the control , GSPE-L , GSPE-M and GSPE-H groups , respectively. The presented results showed that treatment of GSPE at a dose of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day of body<symptom> weight significantly relieved exhaustive exercise-induced fatigue<symptom> , indicated by increasing the forced swimming time. In addition , treatment of GSPE significantly improved the creatine phosphokinase and lactic dehydrogenase , as well as lactic acid level in exhaustive swimming. For underlying mechanisms , treatment of GSPE had anti-fatigue effects by promoting antioxidant ability and resisting oxidative effect , as represented by increased total antioxidative capability levels , enhanced superoxide dismutase and catalase activities , and ameliorated malondialdehyde levels. Furthermore , treatment of GSPE significantly inhibited the activity of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α and interleukin-1β , which suggested that its protective effects on exhaustive exercise-induced fatigue<symptom> may be attributed to inhibition of inflammatory response. Last but not the least , treatment of GSPE significantly improved succinate dehydrogenase and Na +- K +- ATPase levels to enhance mitochondrial function during exhaustive swimming-induced fatigue<symptom>. These results proved that treatment of GSPE possessed the beneficial properties of anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , and mitochondrial protection to improve exhaustive exercise , which suggested that GSPE could be used as an effective functional food to delay
