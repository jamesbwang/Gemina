  Fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared window ( NIR-II) is a new technique that permits visualization of deep anatomical features with unprecedented spatial resolution. Although attractive , effectively suppressing the interference signal of the background is still an enormous challenge for obtaining target-specific NIR-II imaging in the complex and dynamic physiological environment. Herein , dual-pathological-parameter cooperatively activatable NIR-II fluorescence nanoprobes ( HISSNPs) are developed whereby hyaluronic acid chains and disulfide bonds act as the `` double locks '' to lock the fluorescence-quenched aggregation state of the NIR-II fluorescence dyes for performing ultrahigh specific imaging of tumors in vivo. The fluorescence can be lit up only when the `` double locks '' are opened by reacting with the `` dual smart keys '' ( overexpressed hyaluronidase and thiols in tumor) simultaneously. In vivo NIR-II imaging shows that they reduce nonspecific activitation and achieve ultralow background fluorescence , which is 10.6-fold lower than single-parameter activatable probes ( HINPs) in the liver at 15 h postinjection. Consequently , these `` dual lock-and-key ''- controlled HISSNPs exhibit fivefold higher tumor-to-normal tissue ratio than `` single lock-and-key ''- controlled HINPs at 24 h postinjection , attractively realizing ultrahigh specificity of tumor imaging. This is thought to be the first attempt at implementing ultralow background interference with the participation of multiple pathological parameters in NIR-II fluorescence imaging.
