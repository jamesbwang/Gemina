  Recent studies have highlighted the role of mitochondria in dendritic protrusion growth and plasticity. However , the detailed mechanisms that mitochondria regulate dendritic filopodia morphogenesis remain elusive. Cyclophilin D ( CypD , gene name: Ppif) controls the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( mPTP). Although the pathological relevance of CypD has been intensively investigated , little is known about its physiological function in neurons. Here , we have found that genetic depletion of or pharmaceutical inhibiton of CypD blunts the outgrowth of dendritic filopodia in response to KCl-stimulated neuronal depolarization. Further cell biological studies suggest that such inhibitory effect of CypD loss-of-function is closely associated with compromised flexibility of dendritic mitochondrial calcium regulation during neuronal depolarization , as well as the resultant changes in intra-dendritic calcium homeostasis , calcium signaling activation , dendritic mitochondrial motility and redistribution. Interestingly , loss of CypD attenuates oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial calcium perturbations and dendritic protrusion injury. Therefore , our study has revealed the physiological function of CypD in dendritic plasticity by acting as a fine-tuner of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. Moreover , CypD plays distinct roles in neuronal physiology and pathology. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
