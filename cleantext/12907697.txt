  To study the intensity of inflammatory infiltrate and production of interleukin-1β ( ll-1β) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-β ( TNF-β) , fibroblast growth factor-2 ( FGF-2) , glutathione peroxidase ( GPX) , and osteocalcin in response to in-office tooth bleaching in rats. Twenty male Wistar rats were randomized into four groups ( n = 5) according to the received treatment ( tooth bleaching or no treatment- control) and the period of euthanasia after treatment ( 24 h or 10 days). We performed tooth bleaching using a 38 % hydrogen peroxide gel on maxillary and mandibular incisors. After euthanasia , incisors ( 20 per group) were processed for histological analysis , immunohistochemistry staining of ll-1β , TNF-β , FGF-2 and GPX and osteocalcin by immunofluorescence. We analyzed data using the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis/Dunn tests ( p < 0.05). The bleached groups presented statistically significant differences regarding the pulp inflammation<symptom> stage compared with the control groups. Bleached teeth showed moderate/severe inflammatory infiltrate and control groups presented absent inflammatory cells or a negligible number of mononuclear cells ( p < 0.001) at two times ( 24 h and 10 days). There was strong staining for ll-1β , TNF-β , and GPX in bleached groups at 24 h and strong staining for ll-1β , TNF-β , GPX and FGF-2 at 10 days. After 10 days of tooth bleaching , the bleached group showed a statistically superior amount of osteocalcin than the other groups ( p < 0.01). Tooth bleaching with 38 % hydrogen peroxide causes severe pulp inflammation<symptom> , but characteristics of tissue repair after 10 days.
