  Pharmacological treatment of alcohol use disorder represents an essential core of the therapeutic project in a multidisciplinary approach. While non-drug treatment is evolving , from a medical perspective few pharmacotherapies are available; in particular acamprosate , naltrexone and more recently nalmefene among anticraving drugs , disulfiram as an antidipsotropic medication. New studies are focusing on off-label drugs. Moreover , scientific evidence has to support any therapeutic indication which should be tailored on patient needs and comorbidity by considering the individual bio-psycho-social profile. Follow-up is essential in order to assess patient compliance to treatment and monitoring outcomes.
