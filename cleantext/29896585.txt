  Ruthenium dissolution is an inevitable issue for an anodic electrocatalyst in direct methanol fuel cells ( DMFCs). Carbon nitride ( C3N4) decoration derived from the carbonization of melamine simultaneously promoted a PtRu electrocatalyst 's stability and electrocatalytic activity toward concentrated methanol ascribed to the additional active sites from C3N4.
