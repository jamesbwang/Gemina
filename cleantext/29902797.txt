  Hypospadias , the abnormal position of the urethral orifice , is considered a rare congenital malformation of the reproductive organs in male dogs. We present 5 new cases of hypospadias- 2 of the penile type in German Shepherd Dogs and 3 perineal types in a Bavarian Mountain<disease> Hound , a French Bulldog , and an American Staffordshire Terrier. Other abnormalities ( rudimentary or underdeveloped penis , incompletely formed preputial sheath , and bilateral cryptorchidism) were also observed. Molecular analysis of all cases revealed the presence of Y-linked genes ( SRY and ZFY). Cytogenetic and histological analysis could be performed for only 2 cases: a normal male sex chromosome complement ( 78 , XY) and spermatogenetically inactive testicles were observed. A retrospective search for hypospadias in 19,950 medical records of male dogs from a single veterinary clinic in Poland ( 2006-2017) was also performed. Altogether , 10 reports of penile hypospadias were found ( 0.05 %). The majority of the reports concerned German Shepherd Dogs ( 8 cases among 1,511 male dogs of this breed) , and thus , the estimated incidence of hypospadias in this breed was 0.5 %. Moreover , we performed a review of 26 cases of canine hypospadias reported in the years 2004-2017. Our study and the review of the literature suggest that hypospadias is not rare in dogs and that some breeds ( such as German Shepherd Dog and Boston Terrier) may be prone to this disorder.
