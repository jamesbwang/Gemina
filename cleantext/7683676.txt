  The risk of rupture , the most feared clinical consequence of abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> , increases with the enlargement of aorta. MicroRNA-29b ( miR-29b) has emerged as a key modulator of extracellular matrix ( ECM) homeostasis and thereby is proposed to play a crucial role in vascular remodeling. However , agents that alter miR-29b expression are relatively inefficient in the aorta , likely due to inferior uptake. Herein we found that miR-29b was upregulated in aortic smooth muscle cells upon prostaglandin E
