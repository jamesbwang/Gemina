  A series of pregnenolone derivatives were synthesized and assessed for anti-cancer activity against hepatocellular carcinoma cell line ( HepG2). The synthesized hetero-steroids ( compounds 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8a and 8b) were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities using MTT ( 3- ( 4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Apoptotic activity was assessed using dual acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining method and DNA fragmentation assay. Pro-apoptotic genes ( Bax and Bak) and anti-apoptotic genes ( Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) were analyzed using quantitative real time PCR. The results revealed that compounds 4 and 6 displayed cytotoxic activity ( IC
