  Objective Alcohol abuse remains a major health concern. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of alcohol-related emergency department ( ED) admissions in an elderly population. Methods Between 1 September 2013 and 31 August 2014 , we retrospectively analyzed patient charts of patients admitted with a blood alcohol concentration ( BAC) of at least 0.5 g/L to the EDs of all five hospitals in two distinct areas. We focused on the population ≥ 65 years , divided in three subgroups ( 65-74 , 75-84 and ≥ 85 , respectively) and compared them to the 55-64 year group. Results Of the 3918 included patients 645 ( 16.5 %) were between 55 and 64 , and 406 ( 10.4 %) were ≥ 65 years ( 65-74: 267 , 6.8 %; 75-84: 128 , 3.3 %; ≥ 85: 11 , 0.3 %). The male-to-female ratio ranged between 2.1:1 and 2.7:1. BACs decreased with increasing age. In all age groups the majority of patients ( 71.0-77.8 %) were transported by emergency medical services. The chief presenting complaint was trauma and its relative importance increased with age. Contextual factors consisted mostly of chronic abuse ( 43.1-57.8 %). Most frequently patients could be discharged within 24 h , although hospital admission rates increased with age. Conclusion Our study shows that alcohol-related ED admissions in the elderly are common , but less frequent than in younger age groups. More ( preferentially prospective) studies are needed to give more insight in the living environment , prescription medication , socioeconomic cost , etc.. Nonetheless , it is clear that a national action plan should be developed to tackle the alcohol abuse problem in all age groups.
