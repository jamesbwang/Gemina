  Stochastic effects induced by exposure to ionizing radiation rapresent a relevance radioprotection aspect. Actually most of the information about radiation-induced oncogenic risk arise from the follow-up of the atomic bombs survivors ( Life Span Study , LSS); at this information sources have been added over the last decades also data derived from medical , occupational and environmental studies conducted in various parts of the world and their contribution about number of cases and duration of follow-up period is of great relevance. These sources of information , in fact , provide important data related to very different exposure models compared to the historical of the LSS and closer to those who characterize the employment context in the last decades. Data from these studies seem to outline the evidence for which at the current occupational exposure levels significant ERR/Gy are observed only for lung cancer and for all haematological neoplasms with the exception of chronic lymphocytic
