  The aims of this study were to investigate the differences in executive function and the relationship with clinical factors between drug-na誰ve patients with bipolar depression<symptom> ( BDD) and unipolar depression<symptom> ( UPD). Drug-na誰ve patients with BDD , UPD and healthy controls ( HC) were recruited ( 30 cases in each group). All patients were assessed with Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety<symptom> ( HAM-A) , Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 ( HAM-D) , and Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS). Executive function was evaluated by Stroop color-word test ( CWT) and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test ( WCST). In the BDD group , only the CWT number of missing was higher than HCs ( P = 0.047). In the UDP group , CWT number of correct was lower , CWT number of missing was higher , and the WCST indices were worse than the HC group ( P < 0.05). The WCST percentage of errors ( PE) and percentage of conceptual level responses ( PCLR) in the UPD group were worse than the BDD group ( P < 0.05). In the BDD group , no correlations between CWT and WCST indices and clinical features were detected after correcting for multiple comparisons ( P > 0.05). In the UDP group , the WCST PE , PCLR , number of categories completed ( CC) , and the percentage of perseverative responses ( PPR) were correlated to the number of mood episodes ( P < 0.01). This was a small-sample cross-sectional study. The possibility of UPD transforming to bipolar disorder ( BD) in future could not be ruled out. Our results suggested only small differences in executive function between drug-na誰ve patients with BDD and UPD , but in this sample only the UPD group showed differences with HCs. The executive function of drug-na誰ve BDD patients may be associated with duration of current depressive episode , while for UDP patients executive function indices were significantly correlated with number of mood episodes.
