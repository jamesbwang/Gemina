  Selective hydrogen transfer remains a central research focus in catalysis: hydrogenation and dehydrogenation have central roles , both historical and contemporary , in all aspects of fuel , agricultural , pharmaceutical , and fine chemical synthesis. Our lab has been involved in this area by designing homogeneous catalysts for dehydrogenation and hydrogen transfer that fill needs ranging from on-demand hydrogen storage to fine chemical synthesis. A keen eye toward mechanism has enabled us to develop systems with excellent selectivity and longevity and demonstrate these in a diversity of high-value applications. Here we describe recent work from our lab in these areas that are linked by a central mechanistic trichotomy of catalyst initiation pathways that lead highly analogous precursors to a diversity of useful applications.
