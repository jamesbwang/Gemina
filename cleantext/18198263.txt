  Acute exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( AECOPD) are associated with increased mortality , rate of hospitalization , use of healthcare resources , and have a negative impact on disease progression , quality of life and lung function of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD). There is an imperative need to homogenize the definition of AECOPD because the incidence of exacerbations has a significant influence or implication on treatment decision making , particularly in pharmacotherapy and could impact the outcome or change the statistical significance of a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials. In this review , using PubMed searches , we have analyzed the weaknesses<symptom> and strengths of the different used AECOPD definitions ( symptom-based , healthcare-based definition or the combinations of both) , as well as the findings of the studies that have assessed the relationship of different biomarkers with the diagnosis , etiology and differential diagnosis of AECOPD and the progress towards the development of a more precise definition of COPD exacerbation. Finally , we have proposed a simple definition of AECOPD , which must be validated in future clinical trials to define its accuracy and usefulness in daily practice.
