  Follicle-stimulating hormone ( Fsh) is a major regulator of spermatogenesis , targeting somatic cell functions in the testes. We reported previously that zebrafish Fsh promoted the differentiation of type A undifferentiated spermatogonia ( Aund) by stimulating the production of factors that advance germ cell differentiation , such as androgens , insulin-like peptide 3 ( Insl3) and insulin-like growth factor 3 ( Igf3). In addition , Fsh also modulated the transcript levels of several other genes , including some belonging to the Wnt signaling pathway. Here , we evaluated if and how Fsh utilizes part of the canonical Wnt pathway to regulate the development of spermatogonia. We quantified the proliferation activity and relative section areas occupied by Aund and type A differentiating ( Adiff) spermatogonia and we analyzed the expression of selected genes in response to recombinant proteins and pharmacological inhibitors. We found that from the three downstream mediators of Fsh activity we examined , Igf3 , but not 11-ketotestosterone or Insl3 , modulated the transcript levels of two β-catenin sensitive genes ( cyclinD1 and axin2). Using a zebrafish β-catenin signaling reporter line , we showed that Igf3 activated β-catenin signaling in type A spermatogonia , and that this activation did not depend on the release of Wnt ligands. Pharmacological inhibition of the β-catenin or of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K) pathways revealed that Igf3 activated β-catenin signaling in a manner involving PI3K to promote the differentiation of Aund to Adiff spermatogonia. This mechanism represents an intriguing example for a pituitary hormone like Fsh using Igf signaling to recruit the evolutionary conserved , local β-catenin signaling pathway to regulate spermatogenesis.
