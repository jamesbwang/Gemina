  Aggregation of α-Synuclein ( αS) protein to amyloid fibrils is a neuropathological hallmark of Parkinson 's disease ( PD). Growing evidence suggests that extracellular αS aggregation plays a pivotal role in neurodegeneration found in PD in addition to the intracellular αS aggregates in Lewy bodies ( LB). Here , we identified and compared a diverse set of molecules capable of mitigating protein aggregation and exogenous toxicity of αSA53T , a more aggregation-prone αS mutant found in familial PD. For the first time , we investigated the αS anti-amyloid activity of semi-synthetic flavonoid 2 ' , 3 ' , 4 ' trihydroxyflavone or 2-D08 , which was compared with natural flavones myricetin and transilitin , as well as such structurally diverse polyphenols as honokiol and punicalagin. Additionally , two novel synthetic compounds with a dibenzyl imidazolidine scaffold , Compound 1 and Compound 2 , were also investigated as they exhibited favorable binding with αSA53T. All seven compounds inhibited αSA53T aggregation as demonstrated by Thioflavin T fluorescence assays , with modified fibril morphology observed by transmission electron microscopy. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry ( IM-MS) was used to monitor the structural conversion of native αSA53T into amyloidogenic conformations and all seven compounds preserved the native unfolded conformations of αSA53T following 48 h incubation. The presence of each test compound in a 1:2 molar ratio was also shown to inhibit the neurotoxicity of preincubated αSA53T using phaeochromocytoma ( PC12) cell viability assays. Among the seven tested compounds 2-D08 , honokiol , and the synthetic Compound 2 demonstrated the highest inhibition of aggregation , coupled with neuroprotection from preincubated αSA53T
