  Numerous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have been conducted to elucidate emotion processing of patients with bipolar disorder ( BD) , but due to different inclusion criteria used , especially for the history of medication use , the results for euthymic BD patients are inconsistent. For this reason , brain functional effects of psychopharmacological treatments on BD patients have been investigated by numerous fMRI studies , but there is no existing report for brain functional effects of different mood stabilizers. In this study , we compared the emotion processing in BD patients treated by two popularly used mood stabilizer , lithium ( N = 13; 30 ± 9 years) and valproate ( N = 16; 33 ± 8 years) , as well as healthy controls ( HC; N = 16; 29 ± 7 years). Two emotional tasks were applied in this study: one used emotional pictures of everyday objects and scenes , and another used emotional facial expression pictures. The main findings were that BD on lithium showed increased fMRI activation in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral lingual gyrus in response to the positive pictures relative to neutral pictures compared with BD on valproate and HC. Besides , no abnormal activation was observed in the amygdala. Limitations of this study comprise the small sample size and the cross-sectional design. Therefore , the results were suggestive of a different effect of lithium and valproate on brain activities during emotion processing but no causal role can be proposed. The enduring impairments in euthymic state could provide clues to the brain regions involved in the primary pathology of BD.
