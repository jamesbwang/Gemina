  School sense of community has been associated with lower levels of students ' aggressive<symptom> behaviors<symptom>. The main aim of the study was to examine whether the magnitude of the influence of school sense of community on students ' aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom> is similar or different across schools with different levels of aggressive<symptom> behaviors<symptom>. Participants were 1,800 Italian students attending 44 middle and high schools. Using multilevel modeling ( a random intercepts and slopes model) , we found that the magnitude of the negative relationship between sense of community in the school and students ' aggressive<symptom> behaviors<symptom> was stronger in schools with high levels of aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom>.
