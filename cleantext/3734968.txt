  We sought to evaluate the relationship between gestational age ( GA) and neonatal anthropometric parameters , namely head circumference ( HC) and crown-heel length ( CHL). We conducted a cross-sectional study in a tertiary care hospital with 530 consecutively live-born newborns of 28-41 weeks gestation. Anthropometric parameters were measured after three days of life. We summarized the variables using descriptive statistics , including percentile values , and the strength of association was determined through correlation analysis. The correlation was strong for HC and CHL , and linear regression analysis was done to develop predictive equations. HC and CHL correlated well with GA with r-values of 0.863 and 0.859 , respectively. The regression equations derived were GA ( week) = 9.2671 + ( 0.8616 × HC ( cm)) and GA ( weeks) = 7.2489 + ( 0.621 × CHL ( cm)). Multiple regression gave the relationship as GA ( weeks) = 4.0244 + ( 0.4058 × HC ( cm)) + ( 0.4249 × CHL ( cm)). Application of this multiple regression equation to a test cohort of 30 babies for prediction of GA gave a mean margin of error of 2.9 % , indicating that it is a satisfactory tool for prediction. HC and CHL can be used as simple tools for predicting GA in babies when this is in doubt. This can help in identification of high-risk newborns at primary care level without recourse to imaging modalities.
