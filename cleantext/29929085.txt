  Schizotypal traits are a cluster of personality styles suggesting a potential liability for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Interpersonal schizotypal traits include cognitive disorganisation which consists of social anxiety<symptom> , and introvertive anhedonia which consists of a lack of pleasure in social activities. Rejection sensitivity is evident all along this continuum. This study aimed to determine whether psychosocial quality of life ( QOL) , neuroticism and agreeableness mediates the relation between schizotypy and rejection sensitivity. Three hundred and eighteen participants from a predominantly University student population completed an online survey measuring schizotypy , rejection sensitivity , quality of life , and the five-factor personality traits. A regression analysis determined the prediction of rejection sensitivity by schizotypy , quality of life , and the five personality traits. Analyses examined the mediation of the relation between interpersonal schizotypy and rejection sensitivity by psychological QOL , social QOL , neuroticism , and agreeableness. Cognitive disorganisation and introvertive anhedonia predicted greater rejection sensitivity , which in turn were mediated by psychological QOL , social QOL , neuroticism , and agreeableness. The findings show that interpersonal schizotypy relates to greater rejection sensitivity. Psychosocial factors that lower one 's ability to have positive feelings , trusting relationships , and prosocial behaviour , and personality traits that increase worrying mediate this association.
