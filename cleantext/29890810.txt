  To investigate the curative effect of fascia reconstruction of annular ligament combined with internal fixation for the treatment of Monteggia fracture. From December 2014 to October 2016 , 30 cases with Monteggia fracture were treated by fascia reconstruction of annular ligament combined with internal fixation including 18 males and 12 females with an average age of 34.6 years old ranging from 6 to 50 years old. Elbow joint function were evaluated according to Mackay efficacy evaluation criteria. All 30 patients were followed up for an average of 12.5 months. No radial head re-dislocation occurred. Internal fixation of reconstructive plate of ulna were all bone healing. According to the evaluation standard of Mackay curative effect , 23 cases were excellent , 5 cases were good , and 2 cases were poor. There were 4 cases of mild elbow pain and no pain in the wrist joint. Functional recovery was the fastest and most satisfactory in the forearm. Eight cases had dysfunction of elbow extension with an average limitation of 9.1 degrees. Six cases delayed injury of radial nerve were recovered for half a year. For the Monteggia fracture , fascia reconstruction of annular ligament combined with internal fixation can effectively restore the forearm rotation function , the recent effect is satisfactory , further observation is needed for the long-term effect.
