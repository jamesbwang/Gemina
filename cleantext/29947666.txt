  PsaA ( pneumococcal surface antigen A) is a S.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> virulence factor that belongs to the metal transport system. The Manganese PsaA binding has been associated with oxidative stress resistance becoming a pivotal element in the bacteria virulence. It has been shown that Zinc inhibits the Manganese acquisition and promotes bacteria toxicity. We have performed a PsaA conformational analysis both in the presence ( Zn-rPsaA) and in the absence of Zinc ( free-rPsaA). We performed experiments in the presence of different Zinc concentrations to determine the metal minimum concentration which induced a conformational change. The protein in free and Zn-binding condition was also studied in pH ranging 2.6-8.0 and in temperature ranging 25oC-85oC. pH experiments showed a decrease of fluorescence intensity only in acidic medium. Analysis of the heat-induced denaturation demonstrated that Zinc-binding promoted an increase in melting temperature from 55oC ( free-rPsaA) to 78.8 oC ( Zn-rPsaA) according to fluorescence measurements. In addition , the rPsaA stabilization by Zinc was verified through analysis of urea and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation. Data showed that Zinc promoted an increase in the rPsaA stability and its removal by EDTA can lead to a PsaA intermediate conformation. These findings can be considered in the development of vaccines containing PsaA as antigen.
