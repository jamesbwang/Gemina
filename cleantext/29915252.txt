  To investigate the impact of eliminating fat-free adipose tissue ( aFFAT) on the prevalence of low muscle mass in older adults. Three hundred and forty-three ( 153 men and 190 women) well-functioning Japanese older adults ( aged 65-79) had their appendicular lean mass ( aLM) and appendicular fat mass ( aFM) measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA). aFFAT was then estimated from DXA-derived aFM ( aFM = ( FM/0 .15) * 0.85). Both traditional cutoffs and those corrected for aFFAT were used for diagnosing low muscle mass. With traditional cutoff values , the prevalence of low muscle mass using the unadjusted aLM index was 20.1 %. After adjusting the aLM index for aFFAT , the prevalence increased to 49.0 % ( p < 0.001). However , when the cutoff values were also adjusted for aFFAT , the prevalence of low muscle mass only increased to 23.0 % ( p < 0.001). Further , ~ 5 % of the participants ( 7 men and 8 women) were newly classified as having low muscle mass after correction for aFFAT. However , several women ( n = 5) were not classified as having low muscle mass using the corrected cutoff value , although they would have been when using the non-corrected cutoff. Adjusting for the effect of aFFAT on DXA-derived aLM significantly increases the prevalence of low muscle mass in older adults. For clinical research and practice , the influence of aFFAT on DXA-derived aLM may need to be taken into consideration when diagnosing low muscle mass.
