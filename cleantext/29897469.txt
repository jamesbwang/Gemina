  Multiple cases of Candida auris<pathogen> infection have been reported with high mortality rates owing to its MDR nature. Rezafungin ( previously CD101) is a novel echinocandin with enhanced stability and pharmacokinetics that achieves high plasma drug exposure and allows for once weekly dose administration. Evaluate the efficacy of rezafungin in the treatment of disseminated C.<pathogen> auris<pathogen> infection using a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis. Mice were immunosuppressed 3 days prior to infection and 1 day post-infection. On the day of infection , mice were inoculated with 3 Ã— 107C. auris<pathogen> blastospores via the tail vein. Mice were randomized into four groups ( n = 20): rezafungin at 20 mg/kg , amphotericin B at 0.3 mg/kg , micafungin at 5 mg/kg and a vehicle control. Treatments were administered 2 h post-infection. Rezafungin was given additionally on days 3 and 6 for a total of three doses , while the remaining groups were treated every day for a total of seven doses. Five mice from each group were sacrificed on days 1 , 4 , 7 and 10 of the study. Kidneys were removed from each mouse to determine the number of cfu for each respective day. Rezafungin had significantly lower average log10 cfu/g of tissue compared with amphotericin B- and vehicle-treated mice on all days when kidneys were harvested. Additionally , rezafungin-treated mice had significantly lower average log10 cfu/g of tissue compared with micafungin-treated mice on day 10. Our findings show that rezafungin possesses potent antifungal activity against C.<pathogen> auris<pathogen> in a disseminated model of candidiasis.
