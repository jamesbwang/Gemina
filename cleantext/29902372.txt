  During chloramination of bromide-containing waters , the main brominated amine formed is bromochloramine ( NHBrCl). To date , there is no analytical method , free of interference , allowing its accurate quantification. The major reason is that it is not possible to produce a pure NHBrCl solution. In this study , we report a method allowing the accurate quantification of NHBrCl with membrane introduction mass spectrometry ( MIMS). First , the molar absorption coefficient for NHBrCl was determined by quantifying NHBrCl as 2,4,6-tribromophenol by HPLC-UV and comparing the results with the direct UV response at 320 nm. A molar absorption coefficient of 304 M
