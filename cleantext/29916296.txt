  The importance of selective macroautophagy/autophagy in cellular health is increasingly evident. The selective degradation of portions of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) , or reticulophagy , is an emerging example but requires further mechanistic detail and broad evidence of physiological relevance. In a recent study , we identified CCPG1 , an ER-resident transmembrane protein that can bind to Atg8-family proteins and , independently and discretely , to RB1CC1/FIP200. Both of these interactions are required to facilitate CCPG1 's function as a reticulophagy cargo receptor. CCPG1 transcripts are inducible by ER stress , providing a direct link between ER stress and reticulophagy. In vivo , CCPG1 prevents the hyper-accumulation of insoluble protein within the ER lumen of pancreatic acinar cells and alleviates ER stress. Accordingly , CCPG1 loss sensitizes the exocrine pancreas to tissue injury.
