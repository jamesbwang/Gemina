  Substantial evidence shows that long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs) participate in many biological mechanisms , and their dysregulation are also involved in the development and progression of cancers , including gastric cancer ( GC). Long intergenic non-coding RNA 00324 ( LINC00324) , a 2115 bp ncRNA , is located on chromosome 17p13 .1. The biological function and molecular mechanisms of LINC00324 in GC remains undiscovered. In this paper , we found that the expression level of LINC00324 was significantly upregulated in GC tissues compared with the corresponding normal tissues. The overexpression of LINC00324 was correlated with advanced TNM stage , larger tumor size , and lymph node metastasis as well as poor prognosis. Further experiments revealed that knockdown of LINC00324 could suppress the proliferation of GC cells. RNA transcriptome sequencing technology revealed that FAM83B may be a significant downstream target gene of LINC00324. LINC00324 could combine with the RNA-binding protein ( RBP) human antigen R ( HuR) and thus stabilize the expression of FAM83B. Moreover , rescue assays showed that the reduced FAM83B expression partially reversed the promotion of cell growth in GC induced by the overexpression of LINC00324. In conclusion , our study revealed that LINC00324 acted as an oncogene in tumorigenesis and progression , suggesting that it could be a new biomarker in diagnosis and prognosis of GC.
