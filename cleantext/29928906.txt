  Replicative capacity of normal human cells decreases as telomeric sequence is lost at each division. It is believed that when a subset of chromosomes reach a critically short length , an ATM-initiated and p53-mediated transcriptional response inhibits cell growth , promoting cell senescence. In addition to loss of telomeric sequence , senescence can be induced by other stresses including ionizing radiation , oxidative damage , chemical crosslinkers like the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin , as well as overactivation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Our group found that the expression of an isoform of the INhibitor of Growth 1 gene called ING1a increases approximately 10-fold as fibroblasts approach senescence and that forced expression rapidly induces a senescent phenotype in primary diploid fibroblasts , epithelial and endothelial cells that resembles replicative senescence by most physical and biochemical measures. ING1a induces these changes through strongly inhibiting endocytosis to block mitogen signaling by inducing the expression of intersectin 2 , a key scaffolding protein of the endosomal pathway. This , in turn increases the expression of Rb and of p57
