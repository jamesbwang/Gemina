  Disinfection of enamel and dentin following cavity preparation is a necessity. Considering the possible effect of antimicrobial agents on tooth structure and dental adhesives , this study aimed to assess the microleakage of composite restorations following disinfection of cavity walls with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy ( aPDT). Standard class V cavities were prepared in the buccal surfaces of 68 extracted human premolars. The teeth were then randomly divided into four groups ( n = 17) for use of different adhesive systems ( Adper Single Bond 2 or One-Step Plus) and disinfection with aPDT. The cavities were filled with Filtek Ultimate composite. After thermocycling and immersion in 0.5 % fuchsine , the teeth were sectioned and evaluated under a stereomicroscope to determine the microleakage score. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal Wallis and Wilcoxon tests ( P < 0.05). No significant difference was noted in microleakage in the occlusal and gingival walls among the study groups ( P > 0.05). In each study group , microleakage in the gingival wall was significantly higher than that in the occlusal wall ( P < 0.05). Methylene blue-mediated aPDT does not seem to contribute to the microleakage of class V resin-based dental restorations , independently of the composition of bonding agents used.
