  Ischemic stroke is caused by a regional interruption of cerebral blood flow to the brain. Rigorous pre-clinical and clinical research has made landmark progress in stroke treatment using thrombolytics and endovascular thrombectomy. Although numerous successful neuroprotective therapeutic agents for ischemic stroke have been reported in pre-clinical studies , most of them failed in clinical testing. Persistent pre-clinical research has demonstrated that the ischemic brain is not only passively dying but is also actively recovering. Within the neurovascular niche in the peri-infarct tissue , repair mechanisms thrive on the interactions between the neural and vascular compartments. In this review , we discuss exogenous therapy using mesenchymal stromal cell-derived exosomes to amplify endogenous brain repair mechanisms and to induce neurorestorative effects after stroke. Emerging evidence indicates that multiple communication axes between the various organs such as the brain , heart , kidney and gut , and whole body immune response mediated by the spleen can also affect stroke outcome. Therefore , in this review , we summarize this evidence and initiate a discussion on the potential to improve stroke outcome by amplifying multiple brain repair mechanisms after stroke , and by targeting peripheral organs and downstream events to enhance recovery in the injured brain and promote over all well being.
