  Rivaroxaban oral anticoagulant does not need laboratory monitoring , but in some situations plasma level measurement is useful. The objective of this paper was to verify analytical performance and compare two rivaroxaban calibrated anti Xa assays/coagulometer systems with specific or other branch calibrators. In 59 samples drawn at trough or peak from patients taking rivaroxaban , plasma levels were measured by HemosIL Liquid anti Xa in ACLTOP 300/500 , and STA liquid Anti Xa in TCoag Destiny Plus. HemosIL and STA rivaroxaban calibrators and controls were used. CLSI guideline procedures EP15A3 for precision and trueness , EP6 for linearity , and EP9 for methods comparison were used. Coefficient of variation within run and total precision ( CVR and CVWL respectively) of plasmatic rivaroxaban were < 4.2 and < 4.85 % and BIAS < 7.4 and < 6.5 % , for HemosIL-ACL TOP and STA-Destiny systems , respectively. Linearity verification 8- 525 ng/mL a Deming regression for methods comparison presented R 0.963 , 0.968 and 0.982 , with a mean CV 13.3 % when using different systems and calibrations. The analytical performance of plasma rivaroxaban was acceptable in both systems , and results from reagent/coagulometer systems are comparable even when calibrating with different branch material.
