  Despite melanoma immunogenicity and remarkable therapeutic effects of negative immune checkpoint inhibitors , a significant fraction of patients does not respond to current treatments. This could be due to limitations in tumor immunogenicity and profound immunosuppression in the melanoma microenvironment. Moreover , insufficient tumor antigen processing and presentation by dendritic cells ( DC) may hamper the development of tumor-specific T cells. Using two genetically engineered mouse melanoma models (
