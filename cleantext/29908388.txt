  The mood-as-input hypothesis ( MAIH) , which emphasizes the role of mood and stop rules on perseverative thinking , has been extensively studied in relation to worry ( Meeten & Davey , 2011). However , relatively few studies have focused on the applicability of the MAIH to depressive rumination. Consequently , two studies were conducted to further examine the potential relevance of the MAIH to depressive rumination. In the first study , a sample of undergraduate students completed a rumination interview under one of four conditions , including mood ( positive vs. negative) and stop rule ( as-many-as can ( AMA) and feel like stopping ( FL)). It was anticipated that participants in the negative mood/AMA and the positive mood/FL conditions would exhibit the most persistence in the rumination interview. A second , follow-up study was conducted in which a positive rumination condition was added to examine the role of congruence between mood induction and task valence on interview performance. In the first study , support for predictions of the MAIH was found in the negative mood conditions but not the positive mood conditions. In the second study , as predicted , under conditions of mood congruence , the original predictions of the MAIH were supported. However , under conditions of mood incongruence , participants appeared to default to the assigned stop rule. Although the findings are promising , it is noteworthy that the sample was non-clinical. Further , this approach to studying depressive rumination may have somewhat limited ecological validity , as the research was conducted in a controlled laboratory setting. Overall , the current findings provide insight into the conditions under which depressive rumination is most likely to occur.
