  Parasites undergo complex life cycles that comprise a wide variety of cellular differentiation events in different host compartments and transmission across multiple hosts. As parasites depend on host resources , it is not surprising they have developed efficient mechanisms to sense alterations and adapt to the available resources in a wide range of environments. Here we provide an overview of the nutritional needs of different parasites throughout their diverse life stages and highlight recent insights into strategies that both hosts and parasites have developed to meet these nutritional requirements needed for defense , survival , and replication. These studies will provide the foundation for a systems-level understanding of host-parasite interactions , which will require the integration of molecular , epidemiologic , and mechanistic data and the application of interdisciplinary approaches to model parasite regulatory networks that are triggered by alterations in host resources.
