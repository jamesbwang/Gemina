  Mann et al. ( 2018) use recombinant human tyrosinase to screen for novel inhibitors of pigmentation. They develop thiamidol , a new thiazolyl-resorcinol derivative , that is a submicromolar tyrosinase inhibitor and effective for treating solar lentigines. Thiamidol and established inhibitors of pigmentation exhibit substantially different activities on human and mushroom tyrosinase , supporting use of the human enzyme in high-throughput screens.
