  Obesity and physical inactivity are major health problems. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB) surgery results in significant weight<symptom> loss<symptom> and reduces obesity-related morbidity and mortality. Physical activity lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease and premature death. The aims of this study were to elucidate the effects of RYGB followed by 6 months of supervised physical training on physical capacity. In a randomized controlled trial , 60 participants eligible for RYGB were randomized 6 months post-surgery to either two weekly physical training sessions for 26 weeks ( INT) or a control group ( CON).
