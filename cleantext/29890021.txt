  Tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) is a rare but life-threatening infection after solid organ transplant. The present study was undertaken to assess the clinical features , risk factors , and outcome of TB after kidney transplantation in a low-prevalence area. We conducted a retrospective study , describing all kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with TB between 2005 and 2015 in 3 French centers. For each TB case , 2 controls without TB were identified and matched by center , age , transplant date , and birth country. Risk factors associated with TB were identified and survival estimated. Thirty-two cases and 64 control patients were included among 3974 transplantations. The prevalence of TB was 0.83 %. Median age at the time of diagnosis was 64 years; 75 % were born in a high TB prevalence country , but only 3 had received isoniazid prophylaxis for latent TB infection. TB occurred at a median of 22 months after transplantation. On diagnosis , 66 % had disseminated infection. Median duration of treatment was 9 months. Immunosuppressive therapy changes were necessary in all patients because of drug-drug interactions. Among cases , 5 deaths occurred during follow-up ( median duration: 41 months) , one directly related with TB. Survival was significantly lower in transplant recipients with TB , as compared to controls ( P = .001). No predictive factors of tuberculosis<disease> after transplantation were statistically significant in univariate analysis. TB in kidney transplant recipients is a rare and late event , but is associated with significantly reduced survival. Our results emphasize the need for systematic screening for LTBI , followed by IPT in high-risk patients.
