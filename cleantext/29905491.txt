  Dynamic system consisting of ordinary differential equations ( ODEs) is a well-known tool for describing dynamic nature of gene regulatory networks ( GRNs) , and the dynamic features of GRNs are usually captured through time-course gene expression data. Owing to high-throughput technologies , time-course gene expression data have complex structures such as heteroscedasticity , correlations between genes , and time dependence. Since gene experiments typically yield highly noisy data with small sample size , for a more accurate prediction of the dynamics , the complex structures should be taken into account in ODE models. Hence , this study proposes an ODE model considering such data structures and a fast and stable estimation method for the ODE parameters based on the generalized profiling approach with data smoothing techniques. The proposed method also provides statistical inference for the ODE estimator and it is applied to a zebrafish retina cell network.
