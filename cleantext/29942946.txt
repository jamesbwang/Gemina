  The transmetalation reactions of a mercury precursor , ( Pentyl ( N ^ C ^ N) HgCl) ( 19) , with selenium halides ( SeCl4 , SeBr4 , and SeCl2) were attempted to obtain the corresponding organoselenium trichloride ( Pentyl ( N ^ C ^ N) SeCl3) , tribromide ( Pentyl ( N ^ C ^ N) SeBr3) , and monochloride ( Pentyl ( N ^ C ^ N) SeCl) , respectively ( ( N ^ C ^ N) = 5-tert-butyl-1,3-bis- ( N-pentyl-benzimidazol-2 '- yl) phenyl). However , in all the cases , a very facile ionization of the Se-halogen bond was observed leading to the isolation of a new class of air stable arylselenium ( ii) complexes: ( Pentyl ( N ^ C ^ N) Se +) 2 ( HgCl4) 2- ( 20) and ( Pentyl ( N ^ C ^ N) Se +) 2 ( HgBr4) 2- ( 21). This is the first report on the formation of NCN pincer-based arylselenium ( ii) cations via the transmetalation route. Similar reactions were further investigated with several tellurium precursors: ( TeCl4 , TeBr4 and TeI2) which resulted in the formation of analogous aryltellurium ( ii) complexes: ( Pentyl ( N ^ C ^ N) Te +) 2 ( HgCl4) 2- ( 22) , ( Pentyl ( N ^ C ^ N) Te +) ( Cl)- ( 23) , ( Pentyl ( N ^ C ^ N) Te +) 2 ( HgBr4) 2- ( 24) , ( Pentyl ( N ^ C ^ N) Te +) ( Br)- ( 25) and ( Pentyl ( N ^ C ^ N) Te +) 4 ( Hg2Cl4 .72 I3 .28) 4- ( 26). These are only the second set of examples of aryltellurium cations ( hypervalent 10-Te-3 species) with the NCN pincer-based ligand , characterised by X-ray crystallographic studies. The crystallographic studies show a strong SeN/TeN intramolecular interaction , which is confirmed by NBO calculations suggesting the donation of a lone pair of electrons on nitrogen to a lone p-vacancy on selenium/tellurium atoms. The analysis based on NPA derived charges indicates that the contribution of SeN interactions to the electrostatic stabilization energy is in the range of 40-60 % , whereas TeN interactions have a contribution of about 84 % and more , attributed to the differences in the electronegativity of selenium and tellurium. Furthermore , the formation of arylselenium ( ii) and aryltellurium ( ii) complexes was favoured due to the presence of the Ïƒ-hole on the Se/Te centres.
