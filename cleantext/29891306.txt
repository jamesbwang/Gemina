  In this paper , a carboxyl-functionalized organophosphorus oligomer was immobilized onto cotton fabrics using 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid as an environmentally-friendly binder , in the presence of sodium hypophosphite , used as a catalyst , and triethanolamine , which contributes to phosphorous-nitrogen synergism. Moreover , with the aim of reducing the formation of insoluble calcium salt during home laundering , due to the free carboxylic acid groups bound to the cotton fabric , the treated samples were recoated employing three sol-gel precursors , namely 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane , tetraethoxysilane and 3-glycidyloxypropyltriethoxysilane. Samples were thoroughly characterized to understand the bonding between coatings and substrate , as well as the related surface morphology. The thermal behaviour was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis , flame and combustion tests. The results revealed that the treated fabrics were able to achieve self-extinction. Comparing to the untreated sample , tearing strength of PMIDA/BTCA/SHP fabric was reduced in both warp and weft directions , while fabrics coated with an additional sol-gel layer were affected more significantly.
