  Non-pharmacological treatments of stress-induced disorders are promising , since they enhance endogenous stress defense systems and have few contraindications and side effects. This study tested a hypothesis that intermittent hypoxia conditioning ( IHC) ameliorates behavioral , biochemical , and morphological signs of experimental PTSD induced in rats using a model of predator stress ( 10-day exposure to cat urine scent , 15 min daily followed by 14 days of stress-free rest). After the last day of stress exposure , rats were conditioned in an altitude chamber for 14 days at a 1,000 m simulated altitude for 30 min on day 1 with progressively increasing the altitude and duration to 4,000 m for 4 hours on day 5. PTSD was associated with decreased time spent in open arms and increased time spent in closed arms of the elevated X-maze , increased anxiety<symptom> index , and increased rate of freezing responses. Functional and structural signs of adrenal cortex degeneration were also observed , including decreased plasma corticosterone and weight of adrenal glands , reduced thickness of the fasciculate zone , and hydropic degeneration of adrenal gland cells. The thickness of the adrenal fasciculate zone negatively correlated with the anxiety<symptom> index. IHC alleviated both behavioral signs of PTSD and morphological evidence of adrenal cortex dystrophy. Also , IHC alone exerted an anti-stress effect , which was evident from the increased time spent in open arms of the elevated x-maze , and a fewer number of rats displaying freezing responses. Therefore , IHC of rats with experimental PTSD reduced behavioral signs of the condition and damage to the adrenal glands.
