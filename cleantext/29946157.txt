  Apathy and anhedonia are common syndromes<disease> of motivation that are associated with a wide range of brain disorders and have no established therapies. Research using animal models suggests that a useful framework for understanding motivated behaviour lies in effort-based decision making for reward. The neurobiological mechanisms underpinning such decisions have now begun to be determined in individuals with apathy or anhedonia , providing an important foundation for developing new treatments. The findings suggest that there might be some shared mechanisms between both syndromes<disease>. A transdiagnostic approach that cuts across traditional disease boundaries provides a potentially useful means for understanding these conditions.
