  Mutations in the ectodysplasin A gene ( EDA) cause X-LHED ( X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia) , the most common human form of ectodermal dysplasia. Defective EDA signaling is linked to hypoplastic development of epithelial tissues , resulting in hypotrichosis , hypodontia , hypohidrosis , and xerostomia. The primary objective of the present study was to better understand the salivary gland dysfunction associated with ectodermal dysplasia using the analogous murine disorder. The salivary flow rate and ion composition of the 3 major salivary glands were determined in adult Eda-deficient Tabby hemizygous male ( Ta/Y) and heterozygous female ( Ta/X) mice. Submandibular and sublingual glands of Eda-mutant mice were smaller than wild-type littermates , while parotid<symptom> gland<symptom> weight was not significantly altered. Fluid secretion by the 3 major salivary glands was essentially unchanged , but the decrease in submandibular gland size was associated with a dramatic loss of ducts in Ta/Y and Ta/X mice.
