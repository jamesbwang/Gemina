  Honey bee larvae products have been widely used as traditional daily supplements and complementary medicine for health promotion. However , there is little scientific evidence about their bioactivities. This study was designed to examine the anti-tumor and anti-metastasis effects of honey bee larvae powder ( HLP) and explore the underlying mechanism. A subcutaneous transplantation model ( murine breast cancer cell 4T1-LUC) and lung metastasis model ( murine melanoma cell B16-F10) were established to evaluate the anti-tumor and anti-metastasis effects of HLP. Honey bee larvae powder extract ( HLE) was obtained by 70 % ethanol extraction , and its chemical composition was determined according to physiochemical methods. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was performed to test the cytotoxicity of HLE , and qRT-PCR assays were conducted to examine the mRNA levels of tumor marker EZH2 in HLE-treated tumor cells. In vivo xenograft tumor assays in BALB/c mice revealed dose-dependent suppression of tumor growth and lung metastasis showing an inhibition rate of 37.5 % and 70.4 % at 6 g/kg HLP-administered group with no toxicity to the animals. In vitro studies indicated that HLE showed no cytotoxicity to cancer cells at doses up to 1000 μg/mL , however , it significantly decreased EZH2 mRNA levels in HLE ( 1000 μg/mL)- treated B10-F10 cells ( 28.49 %) and 4T1-LUC cells ( 26.75 %). Further studies to elucidate the mechanisms involved and to isolate the active components of honey bee larva may provide more valuable information for its development and application in cancer treatment.
