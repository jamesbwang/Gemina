  New classes of antimicrobials that are effective therapies for infections with multi-drug resistant pathogens are urgently needed. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans<pathogen> has been incorporated into small molecule screening platforms to identify anti-infective compounds that provide protection of a host during infection. The use of a live animal in these screening systems offers several advantages , including the ability to identify molecules that boost innate immune responses in a manner advantageous to host survival and compounds that disrupt bacterial virulence mechanisms. In addition , new classes of antimicrobials that target the pathogen have been uncovered , as well as interesting chemical probes that can be used to dissect new mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions.
