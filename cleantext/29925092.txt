  This article describes corrective antebrachiocarpal re-alignment and arthrodesis for bilateral radial hemimelia ( radial agenesis) in an 8-month-old domestic short-haired cat. Bilateral forelimb deformity of ulnocarpal varus with complete luxation and rotation of the antebrachiocarpal joint spaces , and joint contracture , was observed. Several carpal bones and metacarpal bones I and II and their associated phalanges were absent. Abnormal ambulation and weight bearing on the dorsolateral part of the Successful deformity correction was obtained with subsequent fusion of the antebrachiocarpal joints. No complications were observed. At long-term follow-up ( 4.75 years) , there was good-to-excellent functional result , with approximately 15 Â° internal rotation of the right forelimb Treatment of radial agenesis in the cat has previously been limited to conservative management or limb amputation. While there are several reports of corrective limb-sparing procedures used to treat dogs , this is the first report of a cat with successful salvage corrective surgery.
