  With the increasing popularity of social media , many people who live with HIV/AIDS ( PLWHA) seek social support via Weibo in China. The question arises here as to whether PLWHA perceive higher levels of social support via Weibo than in offline relationships , whether perceived online social support ( PSS-ON) is associated with enacted social support , and whether it is effective in predicting better health outcomes. Based on self-reported data from 432 Chinese PLWHA , the authors investigated perceived offline social support ( PSS-OFF) , PSS-ON , enacted social support , and health outcomes. The empirical results indicate that PSS-ON is significantly associated with employment status , CD4 cell counts , and PSS-OFF. PSS-ON is higher than PSS-OFF for PLWHA , and close Weibo friends are the main source of PSS-ON. Enacted receiving social support and giving social support are relevant , and they contribute as individual predictors of PSS-ON. PSS-ON and PSS-OFF are distinct constructs in predicting the subjective well-being of PLWHA , while PSS-ON is not related to adherence to antiretroviral therapy ( ART) and risky sexual behavior in this study. Limitations and future directions are discussed.
