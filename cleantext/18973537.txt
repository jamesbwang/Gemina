  Wound<disease> healing in human periodontium is a complex process which involves both cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Integrins play a major role in regulation of these cell-cell , cell-matrix interaction. Wound<disease> healing involves two major events i.e. re-epithelialization and connective tissue repair. In this concise review , we will discuss the role of integrins in these major events as well as their impIications in periodontal<disease> wound<disease> repair. Integrins are differentially expressed in both of these major events. In re-epithelialization , keratinocytes express novel integrins receptors αvβ1 , α5β1and αvβ6 which are not expressed in normal healthy epithelium. Re-epithelialization also involves interaction of integrins with TGF-β and fibronectin. Similarly , in connective tissue repair , the activation of fibroblast as well as the expression of integrins α5β1 and α3β1 is upregulated. In healthy periodontium , integrin αvβ6 is normally expressed in junctional epithelium which is generally expressed only at wound<disease> sites in other parts of the body. The epithelialization at implant surface has not been yet fully explored with respect to interactions among integrins and other extra-cellular matrix molecules.
