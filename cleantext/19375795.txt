  The origin and regulation of stem cells sustaining trophoblast renewal in the human placenta remain unclear. Decorin , a leucine-rich proteoglycan restrains trophoblast proliferation , migration/invasiveness and endovascular differentiation , and local decorin overproduction is associated with preeclampsia ( PE). Here , we tested the role of decorin in human trophoblast stem cell self-renewal and differentiation , using two models: an immortalized first trimester trophoblast cell line HTR-8/ SVneo ( HTR) and freshly isolated primary trophoblast ( p-trophoblast) from early first trimester ( 6-9 weeks) placentas. Self-renewal capacity was measured by spheroid forming ability of single cells on ultra-low attachment plates for multiple generations. Markers of embryonic stem ( ES) cells , trophoblast stem ( TS) cells and trophoblast were used to identify stem cell hierarchy. Differentiation markers for syncytial<disease> and extravillous ( EVT) pathways were employed to identify differentiated cells. Bewo cells were additionally used to explore DCN effects on syncytialization. Results reveal that the incidence of spheroid forming stem-like cells was 13-15 % in HTR and 0.1-0.4 % , in early first trimester p-trophoblast , including a stem cell hierarchy of two populations of ES and TS-like cells. DCN restrained ES cell self-renewal , promoted ES to TS transition and maintenance of TS cell stem-ness , but inhibited TS cell differentiation into both syncytial and EVT pathways.
