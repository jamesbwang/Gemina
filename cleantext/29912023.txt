  The safety and effectiveness of same day discharge ( SDD) following percutaneous coronary intervention are well demonstrated; however , the uptake of this model of care is low. The aim was to examine the effectiveness of implementing SDD using a process evaluation methodology. This study was undertaken in a cardiac services department of a tertiary teaching hospital in southeast Queensland , Australia. It was anticipated before the implementation that 120 patients could be discharged the same day in a 6 months ' time period. Patient selection process and guideline adherence were assessed along with patients ' and relatives ' satisfaction. During implementation , 22 patients were discharged home the same day. It was found that staff did not follow the guideline consistently , with an overall adherence of 77.3 %. The uptake of SDD was low in this implementation. The study is important as it provides direction for future improvement both in the criteria and the implementation process.
