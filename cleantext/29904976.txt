  During routine health screenings , pediatricians may note that some infants can not maintain the prone position with an extended arm support at 6 months. However , little is known regarding the development of full-term infants with this developmental deviation. We investigated the developmental course of infants exhibiting this characteristic. We included 2020 full-term infants from a regional center for the Japan Environment and Children 's Study. Their development was measured using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire , Third Edition , at 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , and 3 years. The children were grouped according to their ability to stay prone on extended arms at 6 months , and their development was compared. The questionnaire revealed that 1625 infants could stay prone on extended arms and 179 could not. We excluded 212 infants who could stay prone on extended arms only sometimes , and four did not respond. In the Gross Motor domain , significant difference in questionnaire scores was observed between the `` could '' and `` could-not '' groups at 6 months ( Hedges ' g 1.83) and persisted until 3 years ( Hedges ' g 0.33). Significant differences were also observed in the Communication , Fine Motor , Problem Solving , and Personal-Social domains at 6 months ( Hedges ' g 0.20-0.58) and persisted until 1 , 2 , 2 , and 1.5 years , respectively ( Hedges ' g 0.21-0.25). Infants who can not maintain the prone position on extended arms lag behind those who can , although the effect sizes become relatively small after 1.5 years of age. Early interventions may be considered if delays are problematic or persistent. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
