  OBJECTIVE To test for an association between indwelling urethral catheter placement in cats with urethral obstruction ( UO) and the short-term ( 30-day) risk of recurrent urethral obstruction ( RUO). DESIGN Prospective cohort study. ANIMALS 107 client-owned male cats with UO. PROCEDURES Owners were offered standard care for their cats , including hospitalization , placement of an indwelling urethral catheter , IV fluid therapy , and other supportive treatments ( inpatient group). One-time catheterization and outpatient care were offered ( outpatient group) if standard care was declined. Data regarding signalment , measures of metabolic compromise and urinalysis findings at enrollment , catheterization-related variables , and supportive treatments of interest were collected. Risk of RUO ≤ 30 days after urethral catheter removal was determined for the outpatient vs inpatient group by OR and 95 % confidence interval calculation. Other variables were compared between cats that did and did not develop RUO with Fisher exact and trend tests. RESULTS 91 cats completed the study; 19 ( 5/46 ( 11 %) inpatients and 14/45 ( 31 %) outpatients) developed RUO. Risk of RUO was significantly greater for cats of the outpatient group ( OR , 3.7; 95 % confidence interval , 1.2 to 11.4). Among inpatients , increasingly abnormal urine color at the time of catheter removal was significantly associated with RUO. No other significant associations were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Hospitalization and indwelling catheterization significantly reduced the risk for RUO ≤ 30 days after treatment for the population studied. Results suggested that removal of an indwelling catheter before urine appears grossly normal may be associated with development of RUO. One-time catheterization with outpatient care was inferior to the standard care protocol but was successful in many cats and may be a reasonable alternative when clients can not pursue standard care.
