  To assess the feasibility and utility of a newly developed wireless portable ultrasound `` UProbe- 2 '' for puncture guidance in percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL). The UProbe-2 consists of a probe with integrated ultrasound circuit boards inside , an intelligent terminal that installed specific ultrasound software , and a puncture trestle. The probe can connect to an intelligent terminal via WI-FI. It was used to guide puncture in PCNL in 31 patients who suffered kidney stones or large impacted proximal upper ureteral stones with hydronephrosis from June 2016 to July 2017. Patients ' characteristics as well as parameters during operation were collected. PCNL was successfully performed in all patients with the guidance of the UProbe-2. The mean ( standard deviation) puncture time was 3.6 ( 0.9) minutes , and the median operative duration was 50 ( 35-80) minutes. The primary stone clearance rate was 87 % ( 27/31). No major intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. The UProbe-2 ultrasound is safe and effective for puncture guidance during PCNL according to this initial study. It could provide a new and alternative choice for guidance of PCNL. However , more clinical trials especially randomized controlled trials should be performed.
