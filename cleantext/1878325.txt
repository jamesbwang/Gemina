  Early loss of permanent teeth , congenitally missing lateral incisors or second premolars , extremely displaced or impacted canines , all result in a reduced upper dentition. That leads to the development of crossbite in the maxillary dentition. Partial denture prosthesis , dental implants , and space closure by fixed orthodontics are the various means of treating the edentulous spaces. Protraction of molars is time taking and challenging. Temporary anchorage device ( TAD) helps to protract molars without anchorage loss. This case report describes the orthodontic treatment of a 25-year-old female with lateral dental crossbite using posterior bite plane appliance with fixed orthodontic appliance. Missing upper second molar was protracted mesially to the first molar extraction space by TAD to avoid prosthetic replacement.
