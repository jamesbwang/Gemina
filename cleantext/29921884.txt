  Xuezhikang capsule ( XZK) is a traditional Chinese medicine that contains lovastatin ( Lv) for hyperlipidemia treatment , although it has fewer side effects than Lv. However , the pharmacokinetic mechanisms contributing to its distinct efficacy and low side effects are unclear. Mice were fed a high-fat diet ( HFD) for 6 weeks to induce hyperlipidemia. We first conducted the pharmacokinetic studies in HFD mice following oral administration of Lv ( 10 mg/kg , i.g.) and found that HFD remarkably decreased the active form of Lv ( the lovastatin acid , LvA) exposure in the circulation system , especially in the targeting organ liver , with a declined conversion from Lv to LvA , whereas the Lv ( responsible for myotoxicity) exposure in muscle markedly increased. Then we compared the pharmacokinetic profiles of Lv in HFD mice after the oral administration of XZK ( 1200 mg/kg , i.g.) or an equivalent dose of Lv ( 10 mg/kg , i.g.). A higher exposure of LvA and lower exposure of Lv were observed after XZK administration , suggesting a pharmacokinetic interaction of some ingredients in XZK. Further studies revealed that HFD promoted the inflammation<symptom> and inhibited carboxylesterase ( CES) activities in the intestine and the liver , thus contributing to the lower transformation of Lv into LvA. In contrast , XZK inhibited the inflammation<symptom> and upregulated CES in the intestine and the liver. Finally , we evaluated the effects of monacolins and phytosterols , the fractional extracts of isoflavones , on inflammatory LS174T or HepG2 cells , which showed that isoflavones inhibited inflammation<symptom> , upregulated CES , and markedly enhanced the conversion of Lv into LvA. For the first time , we provide evidence that isoflavones and Lv in XZK act in concert to enhance the efficacy and reduce the side effects of Lv.
