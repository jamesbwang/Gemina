  Due to changes in human lifestyle ( expanded sunbathing , the use of solaria , etc.) and , most importantly , increasing lifetime and thus higher cumulative exposure to solar radiation , skin aging and skin cancer have become major health issues. As a consequence effective photoprotection is of outmost importance to humans. In this regard a lot has been learned in the past about the cellular and molecular basis underlying ultraviolet ( UV) radiation-induced skin damage and , based on this knowledge , numerous skin protective approaches including organic and inorganic UV-filters , but also topically applicable antioxidants , DNA repair enzymes and compatible solutes as well as oral photoprotective strategies based on nutritional supplements have been developed. A new aspect is here that sun protection of human skin might even be possible after solar radiation-induced skin damage has occurred. A second , very important development was prompted by the discovery that also wavelengths beyond the UV spectrum can damage human skin. These include the blue light region of visible light ( VIS) as well as the near infrared range ( IRA) and corresponding sunprotection strategies have thus recently been or are still being developed. In this article we will provide a state of the art summary of these two novel developments and , at the end , we will also critically discuss strengths and weaknesses<symptom> of the current attempts , which mainly focus on the prevention of skin damage by selected wavelengths but greatly ignore the possibility that wavelengths might interfere with each other. Such combined effects , however , need to be taken into account if photoprotection of human skin is intended to be global in nature.
