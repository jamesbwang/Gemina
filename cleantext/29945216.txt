  Coevolutionary interactions between pathogens and their insect vectors can dramatically impact the fitness of herbivorous insects and patterns of plant disease transmission. Soybean mosaic virus ( SMV) is a common disease in soybean production worldwide. Infected seed is the primary source of inoculum in fields and the virus is secondarily spread among plants by the soybean aphid , Aphis glycines Matsumura ( Hemiptera: Aphididae) , in a nonpersistent manner. In this study , we compared the biological fitness of A. glycines colonizing both SMV-infected and uninfected soybean plants. Aphids feeding on SMV-infected soybean seedlings were significantly smaller and lighter than those feeding on uninfected plants across life stages. SMV infection caused delayed development of aphid nymphs on soybean seedlings , but this was more than compensated by a reduction in the pre-reproductive period of apterous adults. The fecundity of A. glycines was reduced when feeding on SMV-infected seedlings , resulting in a lower reproductive rate , a longer generation time , and a slower population doubling time. A smaller proportion of aphid offspring developed into alatae when feeding on SMV-infected soybean seedling , and these took longer to mature than their counterparts on uninfected plants. We infer that SMV infection has significantly negative effects on the biological performance of A. glycines , which may be consistent with the long-term coevolution of SMV , soybean , and A. glycines in the transmission cycle of SMV.
