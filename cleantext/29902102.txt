  Following hospital discharge , stroke survivors may experience a decline in mobility , outings , and community participation. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between demographic and clinical measures , and the level of participation by community-dwelling stroke survivors. A prospective , multicenter , observational study was conducted. Participants were 83 community-dwelling stroke survivors with participation goals who were undergoing post-inpatient rehabilitation in Australia. Predictors collected at baseline , early after hospital discharge were demographic ( age , gender , living situation , home access) and clinical measures ( walking capacity , driving status , baseline outings). The outcome of interest was community participation 6 months later , measured over 7 days as number of outings ( collected in a self-report diary). An outing was any excursion beyond the perimeter of the participants ' dwelling into a public street. Number of outings 6 months after admission to the study ( mean 8.5/ week , SD 5.3) was predicted by number of outings at baseline , walking capacity , and age. Driving status did not predict number of outings. The strongest predictors of community participation were the number of outings early post-inpatient rehabilitation , walking capacity , and age. The only significant modifiable predictor was walking capacity.
