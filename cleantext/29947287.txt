  In this article a novel mechanism of retrograde signaling by chloroplasts during stress is described. This mechanism involves the DNA/RNA binding protein WHIRLY1 as a regulator of microRNA levels. By virtue of its dual localization in chloroplasts and the nucleus of the same cell , WHIRLY1 was proposed as an excellent candidate coordinator of chloroplast function and nuclear gene expression. Comparison of wild-type and transgenic plants with an RNAi-mediated knockdown of WHIRLY1 showed , that the transgenic plants were unable to cope with continuous high light conditions. They were impaired in production of several microRNAs mediating post-transcriptional responses during stress. The results support a central role of WHIRLY1 in retrograde signaling and also underpin a so far underestimated role of microRNAs in this process.
