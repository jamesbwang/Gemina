  In an attempt to explore the early developmental arrest in embryos from polycystic ovarian syndrome<disease> ( PCOS) patients , we sequenced the transcriptome profiles of PCOS arrested 2-cell embryos , non-PCOS arrested 2-cell embryos and non-arrested 2-cell embryos using single-cell RNA-Seq technique. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DEGSeq R package. Gene Ontology ( GO) enrichment was analyzed using the GOseq R package. Data revealed 62 differentially expressed genes between non-PCOS arrested and PCOS arrested embryos and 2217 differentially expressed genes between PCOS arrested and non-arrested 2-cell embryos. A total of 49 differently expressed genes ( DEGs) were annotated with GO terms in the up-regulated genes between PCOS arrested and non-PCOS arrested embryos after GO enrichment. A total of 29 DEGs were annotated with GO terms in the down-regulated genes between PCOS arrested and non-arrested 2-cell embryos after GO enrichment. These data can provide a reference for screening specific genes involved in the arrest of PCOS embryos.
