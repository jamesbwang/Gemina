  With 40,920 American women expected to die from breast cancer in 2018 and global health estimates that more than 508,000 women died in 2011 from this disease , the identification of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of breast cancer can not be ignored. A breakthrough class of cancer drugs that has emerged in recent years and has had an impact in the treatment of breast cancer are the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 ( CDK4/6) inhibitors , with palbociclib the first in class to have received regulatory approval for breast cancer. In this article we will compare and contrast three CDK4/6 inhibitors- palbociclib , ribociclib and abemaciclib- that have received regulatory approval for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Ribociclib and abemaciclib developed after the success of palbociclib represent examples of `` me-too '' therapies increasingly being deployed in oncology.
