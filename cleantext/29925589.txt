  Dickkopf ( Dkk) family proteins are important regulators of Wnt signalling pathways , which play key roles in many essential biological processes. Here we report the first detailed structural and dynamics study of a full-length mature Dkk protein ( Dkk4 , residues 19-224) , including determination of the first atomic resolution structure for the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain ( CRD1) conserved among Dkk proteins. We discovered that CRD1 has significant structural homology to the Dkk C-terminal cysteine-rich domain ( CRD2) , pointing to multiple gene duplication events during Dkk family evolution. We also show that Dkk4 consists of two independent folded domains ( CRD1 and CRD2) joined by a highly flexible , non-structured linker. Similarly , the N-terminal region preceding CRD1 and containing a highly conserved NXIR/K sequence motif was shown to be dynamic and highly flexible.We demonstrate that Dkk4 CRD2 mediates high-affinity binding to both the E1E2 region of LDL receptor-related protein 6 ( LRP6 E1E2) and the Kremen1 ( Krm1) extracellular domain. In contrast , the N-terminal region alone bound with only moderate affinity to LRP6 E1E2 , consistent with binding via the conserved NXIR/K motif , but did not interact with Krm proteins. We also confirmed that Dkk and Krm family proteins function synergistically to inhibit Wnt signalling. Insights provided by our integrated structural , dynamics , interaction and functional studies have allowed us to refine the model of synergistic regulation of Wnt signalling by Dkk proteins. Our results indicate the potential for the formation of a diverse range of ternary complexes comprising Dkk , Krm and LRP5/6 proteins , allowing fine-tuning of Wnt-dependent signalling.
