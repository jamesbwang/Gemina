  Metachronous neoplasms have rarely been reported in patients with neuroblastoma. This report presents the clinical case of a 23-month-old child who was diagnosed with an anaplastic medulloblastoma 5 months after completing treatment for stage IV neuroblastoma. The patient was treated with complete surgical resection and adjuvant chemoradiation followed by maintenance chemotherapy at an outside institution and came to our institution for further management. A pathologic diagnosis and review of both the suprarenal and posterior fossa masses were performed , as well as a genetic analysis of both cerebellar tumor tissue and blood using next-generation gene sequencing. At our institution , the patient was submitted to induction chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation and remains free of disease 2 years after completion of treatment. Genetic analysis revealed multiple somatic copy number variations with most deleted genes located in 2q37 , a region which harbors genes involved in epigenetic regulation and tumor suppression. A homozygous deletion was found in the
