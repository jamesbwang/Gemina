  OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of dental anomalies in brachycephalic cats from various geographic regions and analyze potential relationships with oral disease. DESIGN Prospective multicenter cross-sectional study. ANIMALS 50 purebred Persian ( n = 42) and Exotic ( 8) cats. PROCEDURES Cats were anesthetized , and a complete dental examination , dental charting , 3-view oral photography , and full-mouth dental radiography were performed. RESULTS Malocclusions were observed in 36 ( 72 %) cats. Crowding of the teeth was evident in 28 ( 56 %) cats , with the incisors being most commonly affected. Malpositioned teeth were noted in 32 ( 64 %) cats , with abnormal orientation being the most common anomaly followed by rotation and impaction. Numerical abnormalities were present in 38 ( 76 %) cats , including 6 ( 12 %) with hyperdontia and 32 ( 64 %) with hypodontia. Periodontal<disease> disease<disease> was reported in 44 ( 88 %) cats , and cats with periodontal<disease> disease<disease> were older than cats without. Tooth resorption was evident in 35 ( 70 %) cats. Overall , 123 of 1,349 ( 8.7 %) teeth had external inflammatory resorption and 82 ( 6.1 %) had external replacement resorption. The premolar teeth were the teeth most commonly affected with inflammatory resorption , whereas the canine teeth were the teeth most commonly affected with replacement resorption. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that because of their brachycephaly , Persian and Exotic cats have unique oral and dental features that may predispose them to dental disease ( eg , tooth resorption and periodontal<disease> disease<disease> Knowledge of the particular dental anomalies common in brachycephalic cats could aid in early detection and mitigation of dental disease in these breeds.
