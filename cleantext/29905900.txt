  Weight-bearing sports might influence the alignment of the lower extremities during growth. The relationship between participation in weight-bearing sports and the alignment of the lower extremities in adolescents has not been adequately studied yet. The aim of the study was to investigate whether sports participation during growth in early adolescence is correlated with the development of genu varum. The design was a correlation study in which 1008 ( 564 boys , 444 girls) healthy adolescents ( from 12 to 19 years of age) were recruited in secondary schools. The alignment of the knee was determined by measuring the intercondylar ( IC) and intermalleolar ( IM) distance using a specially designed instrument and an inside calliper. The degree of sports participation of the participants was determined by a questionnaire in which they were asked how many hours a week they participated in sports and for how many years in total. The results of this study revealed a significant correlation between participation in weight-bearing sports and genu varum in each of three different age groups , both for boys and girls. Our results show that there is an association between the alignment of the knee joint and participation in weight-bearing sports during early adolescence.
