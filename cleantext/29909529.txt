  Recently , VEGFR-2 has been detected not only in vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells but also in some non-vascular endothelial cells , particularly human hair follicles , sebaceous glands , and sweat<symptom> glands. In addition , VEGFR-2 has been confirmed to play direct roles in hair follicle keratinocyte regulation beyond simply angiogenesis. To elucidate whether VEGFR-2 activation plays a role in hair follicle cycling regulation , immunofluorescence of VEGFR-2 expression was performed during hair cycling of the dorsum of the mouse induced by hair plucking. We observed that staining for VEGFR-2 in hair follicles during anagen II and IV was much stronger than during anagen VI , catagen and telogen. During anagen II , intense staining for VEGFR-2 was observed on the keratinocyte strands of the hair follicle. Subsequently , we detected intense staining for VEGFR-2 in the ORS , IRS and hair bulb during anagen IV. Moderate staining for VEGFR-2 was detected in the ORS and hair bulb , but staining was most intense in IRS during anagen VI. During catagen , staining for VEGFR-2 in the IRS remained intense , while staining in the ORS and hair bulb was significantly weakened and was negative in the dermal papilla. During telogen , we detected VEGFR-2 in germ cells , cap , and club hair adjoining the epidermis. In conclusion , VEGFR-2 was expressed on the hair follicles of the dorsum of the mouse and varied in expression on the mouse hair follicles during hair cycling , suggesting that VEGFR-2 may exert roles in hair cycle regulation in hair follicles on the dorsum of mice.
