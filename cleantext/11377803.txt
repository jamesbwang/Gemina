  Antitumor chemotherapy remains one of the most important challenge of the medicinal chemistry. Emerging research in chemotherapy is focused on exploiting the biochemical differences between cancer cell and normal cell metabolism in order to reduce the side effects and increase antitumor therapy efficacy. The higher mitochondrial transmembrane potential of cancer cells compared to not-transformed cells favors the intra-mitochondrial accumulation of cationic drugs in the former. This feature could be exploited to allow selective delivery of antineoplastic drugs to the cancer cells. In this work we designed and synthetized phenol derivatives joined to the triphenylphosphonium ( TPP) cation , a well-known vector for mitochondrial targeting. Two designed phenol TPP-derivatives
