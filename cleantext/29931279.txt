  Accurate prediction of a protein contact map depends greatly on capturing as much contextual information as possible from surrounding residues for a target residue pair. Recently , ultra-deep residual convolutional networks were found to be state-of-the-art in the latest Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction techniques ( CASP12 , ( Schaarschmidt et al. , 2018)) for protein contact map prediction by attempting to provide a protein-wide context at each residue pair. Recurrent neural networks have seen great success in recent protein residue classification problems due to their ability to propagate information through long protein sequences , especially Long Short-Term Memory ( LSTM) cells. Here we propose a novel protein contact map prediction method by stacking residual convolutional networks with two-dimensional residual bidirectional recurrent LSTM networks , and using both one-dimensional sequence-based and two-dimensional evolutionary coupling-based information. We show that the proposed method achieves a robust performance over validation and independent test sets with the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve ( AUC) > 0.95 in all tests. When compared to several state-of-the-art methods for independent testing of 228 proteins , the method yields an AUC value of 0.958 , whereas the next-best method obtains an AUC of 0.909. More importantly , the improvement is over contacts at all sequence-position separations. Specifically , a 8.95 % , 5.65 % and 2.84 % increase in precision were observed for the top L âˆ• 10 predictions over the next best for short , medium and long-range contacts , respectively. This confirms the usefulness of ResNets to congregate the short-range relations and 2D-BRLSTM to propagate the long-range dependencies throughout the entire protein contact map ` image '.
