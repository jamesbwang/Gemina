  α-Phosphoglucomutase ( αPGM) , in its phosphorylated state , catalyzes the interconversion of α-d-glucose 1-phosphate and α-d-glucose 6-phosphate. The αPGM of Lactococcus<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> is a type C2B member of the haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase ( HAD) enzyme family and is comprised of a Rossmann-fold catalytic domain and inserted α/β-fold cap domain. The active site is formed at the domain-domain interface. Herein , we report the results from a kinetic-based study of L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> αPGM catalysis , which demonstrate enzyme activation by autocatalyzed phosphorylation of Asp8 with αG1P , the intermediacy of αG1 ,6 bisP in the phospho Ll-αPGM-catalyzed conversion of αG1P to G6P , and the reorientation of the αG1 ,6 bisP intermediate via dissociation to solvent and rebinding. In order to provide insight into the structural determinants of L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> αPGM substrate recognition and catalysis , metal cofactor and substrate specificities were determined as were the contributions made by active-site residues toward catalytic efficiency. Lastly , the structure and catalytic mechanism of L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> αPGM are compared with those of HAD family phosphomutases L.<pathogen> lactis<pathogen> β-phosphoglucomutase and eukayotic α-phosphomannomutase to provide insight into the evolution of phosphohexomutases from HAD family phosphatases.
