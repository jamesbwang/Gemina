  Ucides cordatus is a relevant fishery resource of Brazilian mangroves and requires legal normative to sustainable use based on stock assessment and management. This study evaluated some population parameters ( structure , density , abundance , fishery potential and stock) of this crab species in Brazil Southeast ( São Paulo , State) , discussing the use of the results to delineate fishery management strategies. Density was monthly evaluated ( September 1998 to August 1999) , using five sample quadrats of 2x2 m. Density ( ind.m-2) was indirectly estimated by counting the opened ( with biogenic activity) and closed galleries , and contrasted with flooding level by tides using the vertical distribution of macroalgae in the base of trees. Density of U. cordatus ranges from 2 to 11 ind.m-2 ( 6 ± 2 ind.m-2) and statistical difference occurred among monthly means ( F = 11.58; p = 0.000). The relationship density vs. tidal flooding indicated a decrease of U. cordatus density in mangroves with higher levels of tidal flooding ( r = -0.94; p = 0.001). The total abundance of U. cordatus was estimated in 63.7 millions of crabs in 10.61 km2 , with a reduction of 34.9 % due to total mortality discount. Estimates like that are uncommon in literature , and could be used for fishery forecasts , allowing improvement by the introduction of new variables to be known in the future.
