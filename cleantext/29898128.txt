  The article presents new ways of interpreting the concept `` medical police , '' which was used in the West in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Alternative understandings of the medical police in Europe , distinct from those offered by George Rosen and Michel Foucault , the preeminent twentieth-century thinkers on the topic , were derived by studying related treatises written in Germany , the United Kingdom , France , Spain , and Portugal. Records indicate that these treatises were not an exclusively German phenomenon nor did they constitute State regulation of the medical profession alone. Rather , they were broad-ranging treatises on how the State should manage public health in each location , according to its specific features and demands , whether institutional or political in nature.
