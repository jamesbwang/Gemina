  The effect of ions on the structure of water in dilute solutions , whether they are structure-makers or structure-breakers , is manifested also in the volatility of the water. For more than 40 uni-univalent electrolytes , there is a linearly increasing relationship between 2φ ( m = 0.4)- φ ( m = 0.2) , where φ is the osmotic coefficient and m is the molality , and the difference between the viscosity B-coefficients of the cation and anion. Exceptions to this relationship are electrolytes with highly structure-making anions and with hydrophobic cations.
