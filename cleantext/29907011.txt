  The study of systems with fractional charges and spins has become an extremely important tool to understand errors in approximate electronic structure methods , particularly in the context of density functional theory. Meanwhile , similar studies with wavefunction ( WF)- based methods beyond second-order perturbation theory have been lacking. In this contribution , we study the performance of different coupled cluster ( CC) and many-body perturbation theory ( MBPT)- based methods for fractional charges. The use of the conventional and renormalized formulations of fractional-charge MBPT is discussed. The fractional spin behavior of the coupled cluster doubles ( CCD) method is also investigated. Overall , all tested WF methods show very promising performance for the fractional charge problem. CCD is also quite accurate for the fractional spin problem in He
