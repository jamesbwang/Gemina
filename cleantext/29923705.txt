  Photonic crystals are essentially a periodic ( `` crystalline '') arrangement of dielectric nanoparticles that respond in unison to incident light. They can be used to harvest light in various applications such as photocatalysis , solar cells , and lasing. In this work , we prepared the photonic crystals of dendritic fibrous nanosilica ( DFNS) by their self-assembly. Because of the narrow particle size distribution of the as-synthesized DFNS , they readily formed colored photonic crystals. The photonic band gap was found to be tunable by using DFNS of various sizes and fiber densities. Notably , even after having similar particle sizes ( but with different fiber densities) , they showed different photonic band gaps , indicating that the fiber density plays a role in the band gap of photonic crystals. Such observations have not been reported before. This could have arisen from the difference in their refractive indices because of the difference in their fiber densities and hence the variation in the silica content , leading to a different optical signature.
