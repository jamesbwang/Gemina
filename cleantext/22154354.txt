  This paper introduces an event-based methodology to perform arbitrary linear basis transformations that encompass a broad range of practically important signal transforms , such as the discrete Fourier transform ( DFT) and the discrete wavelet transform ( DWT). We present a complexity analysis of the proposed method , and show that the amount of required multiply-and-accumulate operations is reduced in comparison to frame-based method in natural video sequences , when the required temporal resolution is high enough. Experimental results on natural video sequences acquired by the asynchronous time-based neuromorphic image sensor ( ATIS) are provided to support the feasibility of the method , and to illustrate the gain in computation resources.
