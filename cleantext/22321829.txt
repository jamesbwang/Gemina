  Centrosome number is tightly controlled to ensure proper ciliogenesis , mitotic spindle assembly , and cellular homeostasis. Centrosome amplification ( the formation of excess centrosomes) has been noted in renal cells of patients and animal models of various types of cystic kidney disease. Whether this defect plays a causal role in cystogenesis remains unknown. Here , we investigate the consequences of centrosome amplification during kidney development , homeostasis , and after injury. Increasing centrosome number in vivo perturbed proliferation and differentiation of renal progenitors , resulting in defective branching morphogenesis and renal hypoplasia. Centrosome amplification disrupted mitotic spindle morphology , ciliary assembly , and signaling pathways essential for the function of renal progenitors , highlighting the mechanisms underlying the developmental defects. Importantly , centrosome amplification was sufficient to induce rapid cystogenesis shortly after birth. Finally , we discovered that centrosome amplification sensitized kidneys in adult mice , causing cystogenesis after ischemic renal injury. Our study defines a new mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of renal cystogenesis , and identifies a potentially new cellular target for therapy.
