  In the present study , we studied the role of chloroplastic ATP synthase in photosynthetic regulation during leaf maturation. We measured gas exchange , chlorophyll fluorescence , P700 redox state , and the electrochromic shift signal in mature and immature leaves. Under high light , the immature leaves displayed high levels of non-photochemical quenching ( NPQ) and P700 oxidation ratio , and higher values for proton motive force ( pmf) and proton gradient ( Î”pH) across the thylakoid membranes<symptom> but lower values for the activity of chloroplastic ATP synthase ( g
