  Ischemic heart disease ( IHD) related to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease ( CAD) is one of the most prevalent causes of death in Europe. Postmortem evaluation of IHD remains a challenge because of possible non-specific autopsy finding in some autopsy cases , especially in early myocardial ischemia. High-sensitive cardiac troponin T ( hs-TnT) is used today in clinical practice as the `` gold standard '' to diagnose the myocardial ischemia , and might also be applied as an ancillary tool for post-mortem evaluation. The goal of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of post-mortem serum hs-TnT assay in cases of sudden death related to IHD. We will also investigate the influence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR) attempts on post-mortem hs-TnT levels. The hs-TnT values in serum were retrospectively analysed in 85 autopsy data. 52 cases with clinical history and morphological results suggesting cardiac ischemia were included in the study group ( mean age 53.5; age range 34-75) and 33 cases in the control group ( mean age 40.4; age range 15-69). The group 's statistical comparison was performed using logistic regression model. Our study showed a significant non-linear association between hs-TnT serum values and post-mortem diagnosis of sudden deaths related to IHD ( p-value 0.005). The shape of the relationship is showing that the probability of death due to IHD increases quickly with a light level of hs-TnT ( maximum around 90ng/L) then decreases slightly while remaining at high in values. No significant difference in the hs-TnT serum values was found between the CPR and the non-CPR cases ( p-value 0.304). The measurement of hs-TnT serum values might be considered as an ancillary tool for the evaluation of death related to IHD , while taking necessary precautions in the interpretation of the results.
