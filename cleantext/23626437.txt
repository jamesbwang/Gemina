  Takayasu arteritis ( TA) is a chronic granulomatous<pathogen> inflammation<pathogen> affecting the aorta and its main branches. The clinical symptoms are mainly due to arterial claudication and end-organ ischaemia. Abdominal<pathogen> pain<pathogen> is an uncommon manifestation of TA. We present a rare case of TA in a 13-year-old boy who first presented with abdominal<pathogen> pain.<pathogen> An emergency aortic stent implantation and aneurysm<pathogen> embolization were performed , and the intra-operative diagnosis was aortic pseudoaneurysm. A consultation with the department of rheumatism determined that the diagnosis was Takayasu arteritis according to the medical history , physical examination and auxiliary examination results. The patient was transferred to the department of rheumatism for treatment with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide. Six months after the initial presentation , he was doing well clinically with no additional vascular involvement , and his blood<pathogen> pressure<pathogen> had been stabilized with oral antihypertensive drugs. More detailed examinations of children with acute<pathogen> abdominal<pathogen> pain<pathogen> should be performed. Abdominal computed tomography ( CT) should be administered , peripheral impulses and arterial bruits should be checked , and blood<pathogen> pressure<pathogen> among the four limbs should be monitored to rule out plausible emergencies such as an aneurysm<pathogen> caused by TA.
