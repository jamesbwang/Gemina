  Diagnosis of brain dementia , particularly early mild cognitive impairment ( eMCI) , is critical for early intervention to prevent the onset of Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD) , where cognitive decline is severe and irreversible. There is a large body of machine-learning based research investigating how dementia alters brain connectivity , mainly using structural ( derived from diffusion MRI) and functional ( derived from resting-state functional MRI) brain connectomic data. However , how early dementia affects cortical brain connections in morphology remains largely unexplored. To ﬁll this gap , we propose a joint morphological brain multiplexes pairing and mapping strategy for early MCI detection , where a brain multiplex not only encodes the similarity in morphology between pairs of brain regions , but also a pair of brain morphological networks. Experimental results conﬁrm that the proposed framework outperforms in classification accuracy several state-of-the-art methods. More importantly , we unprecedentedly identiﬁed most discriminative brain morphological networks between eMCI and NC , which included the paired views derived from maximum principal curvature and the sulcal depth for the left hemisphere and sulcal depth and the average curvature for the right hemisphere. We also identified the most highly correlated morphological brain connections in our cohort , which included the ( pericalcarine cortex , insula cortex) on the maximum principal curvature view , ( entorhinal cortex , insula cortex) on the mean sulcal depth view , and ( entorhinal cortex , pericalcarine cortex) on the mean average curvature view , for both hemispheres. These highly correlated morphological connections might serve as biomarkers for early MCI diagnosis.
