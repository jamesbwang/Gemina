  Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) is commonly associated with depressive symptoms , which affect prognosis and quality of life. We investigated the antidepressant effects of n-3 fatty acids ( n-3FAs) monotherapy ( without conventional antidepressants) for T2DM patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms. A 10-wk , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel-group ( 1:1 ratio) randomized trial of n-3FAs ( 2700 mg/day EPA: DHA ratio = 2) versus placebo in 88 Iranian diabetic patients with mild to moderate<symptom> depression<symptom> based on Beck Depression<symptom> Inventory II ( BDI-II-PERSIAN) was conducted. This study started from July 2014 to January 2015 in Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran. The primary event was defined as worsened , non-changed , or inconsiderably improved depression<symptom> ( < 5 unit decrease in BDI-II-PERSIAN depression<symptom> scores after treatment) ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02261545). Randomly , 44 T2DM patients were treated with n-3FAs supplements and 44 cases received placebo ( three patients discontinued). n-3FAs could significantly protect patients against the aforesaid event and exhibit satisfactory prevention ( number needed to treat with 95 % confidence interval: 2.52 , 1.71-4.74). No serious adverse reactions were reported. n-3FAs supplementation had significant antidepressant effects in T2DM patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms , not confounded by metabolic factors and disease duration.
