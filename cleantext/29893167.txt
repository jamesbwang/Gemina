  To quantify and compare the incremental cost associated with in-hospital stroke , death , and myocardial infarction ( MI) after carotid endarterectomy ( CEA) vs carotid artery stenting ( CAS). A retrospective analysis was performed of 100,185 patients ( mean age 70.7 Â± 9.5 years; 58.3 % men) who underwent CEA ( n = 86,035) or CAS ( n = 14,150) between 2009 and 2015 and were entered into the Premier Healthcare Database. Multivariate logistic models and generalized linear models were used to analyze binary outcomes and hospitalization costs , respectively. Outcomes are presented as the adjusted odds ratio ( aOR) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI). CAS was associated with 1.6 times higher adjusted odds of stroke ( aOR 1.55 ( 95 % CI 1.36 to 1.77) , p < 0.001) and with 2.6 times higher odds of death ( aOR 2.60 ( 95 % CI 2.14 to 3.17) , p < 0.001) compared with CEA. There was no significant difference in MI risk between the 2 procedures. The adjusted incremental cost of death and MI were similar between the 2 procedures. However , the adjusted incremental cost of stroke was significantly higher in CEA compared with CAS by an estimated $ 2000. When stratified with respect to symptomatic status , the increased adjusted incremental cost of stroke in CEA was mainly seen in asymptomatic patients ( $ 5284 vs $ 2932 , p < 0.01). The incremental cost of in-hospital stroke is relatively higher in CEA compared to CAS. However , CEA remains a more cost-effective carotid intervention due to lower complication rates and baseline costs compared with CAS. Long-term cost-effectiveness studies are needed before definite conclusions are made.
