  Understanding the detailed mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond is fundamentally important , not only to the design of tailored cost-efficient , stable and specific catalysts but also to the development of specific glycosidase inhibitors as therapeutics. Retaining glycosidases employ two key carboxylic acid residues , typically glutamic acids , in a double-displacement mechanism involving a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. One Glu functions as a nucleophile while the other acts as a general acid/base. A significant part of enzymatic proficiency is attributed to a `` perfect match '' of the electrostatics provided by these key residues , a hypothesis that has been remarkably difficult to prove in model systems or in enzymes themselves. We experimentally probe this synergy by preparing synthetic variants of a model glycosidase Bacillus<pathogen> circulans<pathogen> Î²-xylanase ( Bcx) with the nucleophile Glu78 substituted by 4-fluoro or 4,4-difluoroglutamic acid to progressively reduce nucleophilicity. These Bcx variants were semisynthesized by preparation of optically pure fluoroglutamic acid building blocks , incorporation into synthetic peptides , and ligation onto a truncated circular permutant of Bcx. By measuring the effect of altered electrostatics in the active site on enzyme kinetic constants , we show that lowering the nucleophile p Ka by two units shits the pH-dependent activity by one pH unit. Linear free energy correlations using substrates of varying leaving group ability indicate that by reducing nucleophilic catalysis the concerted mechanism of the enzyme is disrupted and shifted toward a dissociative pathway. Our study represents the first example of site-specific introduction of fluorinated glutamic acids into any protein. Furthermore , it provides unique insights into the synergy of nucleophilic and acid/base catalysis within an enzyme active site.
