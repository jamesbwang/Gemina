  Chemical vapor deposited graphene suffers from two problems: transfer from metal catalysts to insulators , and photoresist induced degradation during patterning. Both result in macroscopic and microscopic damages such as holes , tears , doping , and contamination , translated into property and yield dropping. We attempt to solve the problems simultaneously.
