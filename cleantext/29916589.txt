  This paper will examine the difficulties encountered in the bio-medical approach adopted to understand the psycho-social needs present in the clinical observation of a diseased body<symptom> to the treatment of the person. Traditional interpretation tools are not sufficient to comprehend the complexity of the factors involved in prevention processes , and the risk is that the introduction of new approaches will be delayed. Knowledge is an interactive , communicative and social process , meaning our focus shifts from the things we see to the way we see them , only to see what we do n't normally see. As a result , the multi-dimensional concept of health implies a revised disciplinary status , particularly if the concept of gender is not to be considered synonymous with sex , but rather an interpretative category of the differences that characterize the roles , expectations and obligations of men and women from a cultural perspective. Indeed , the way in which we live our everyday life , our use of time , our work and family lives , opportunities and relationships , in addition to our access to services condition our perception of health and result in the risk of disease onset. It is for this reason that we need to examine doctor-patient relationships and caregiving practices.
