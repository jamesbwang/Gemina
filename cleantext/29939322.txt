  Deficiency of copper ( Cu) causes low fertility in many plant species , but the molecular mechanisms underlying distribution of Cu to the floral organs are poorly understood. Here , we found that a member of yellow-stripe like ( YSL) family , YSL16 encoding the Cu-nicotianamine ( Cu- NA) transporter , was highly expressed in the rachilla , with less expression in the palea and lemma of rice ( Oryza sativa). GUS staining of transgenic rice carrying OsYSL16 promoter-GUS showed that OsYSL16 was mainly expressed in vascular bundles of rachilla as well as palea and lemma. Knockout of OsYSL16 resulted in decreased Cu distribution to the stamens , but increased distribution to the palea and lemma. A short-term ( 24 h) 65Cu-labelling experiment confirmed increased Cu concentration of palea and lemma in the mutant. Furthermore , we found that redistribution of Cu from palea and lemma was impaired in osysl16 mutant after exposure to Cu-free solution. osysl16 mutant showed low pollen germination , but this was rescued by addition of Cu in the medium. Our results indicate that OsYSL16 expressed in the vascular bundles of rachilla is important for preferential distribution of Cu to the stamens , while OsYSL16 in vascular bundles of palea and lemma is involved in Cu redistribution under Cu-limited conditions in rice.
