  Esophagogastric anastomosis performed after esophagectomy is technically complex and often the source of postoperative complications. The best technique for this anastomosis remains a matter of debate. We describe a new all-stapled side-to-side anastomosis , which we refer to as triple-stapled quadrilateral anastomosis ( TRIQ) , that can be performed after minimally invasive surgery , and we report results of a retrospective evaluation of postoperative outcomes among the 60 patients in whom this anastomosis has been performed thus far. The anastomosis is created by apposition of the posterior walls of the esophagus and stomach. A linear stapler is applied to create a V-shaped posterior anastomotic wall. The anterior wall is closed in a gentle chevron-like shape with the use of 2 separate linear staplers , resulting in a wide quadrilateral anastomosis. The anastomosis is then wrapped with a greater omentum flap. The patient group comprised 48 men and 12 women with a mean age of 67.8 years. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed in 43 of these patients. Neither the thoracoscopic or laparoscopic procedure was converted to open surgery in any patient. The median operation time was 474 min ( range 680-320 min). The intraoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> volume was 104.4 mL ( range 240-30 mL). There were no anastomosis-related complications above Clavien-Dindo grade II. TRIQ can be performed easily and safely , and good short-term outcome can be expected.
