  Overlooking other conditions during cancer could undermine gains associated with early detection and improved cancer treatment. We conducted a systematic review on the quality of diabetes care in cancer. Systematic searches of Medline and Embase , from 1996 to present , were conducted to identify studies on the quality of diabetes care in patients diagnosed with cancer. Studies were selected if they met the following criteria: longitudinal or cross-sectional observational study; population consisted of diabetes patients; exposure consisted of cancer of any type and outcomes consisted of diabetes quality of care indicators , including healthcare visits , monitoring and testing , control of biologic parameters , or use of diabetes and other related medications. Structured data collection forms were developed to extract information on the study design and four types of quality indicators: physician visits , exams or diabetes education ( collectively ` healthcare visits '); monitoring and testing; control of biologic parameters; and medication use and adherence. There were 15 studies from five countries. There was no consistent evidence that cancer was associated with fewer healthcare visits , lower monitoring and testing of biologic parameters or poorer control of biologic parameters , including glucose. However , the weight of the evidence suggests cancer was associated with lower adherence to diabetes medications and other medications , such as anti-hypertensives and cholesterol-lowering agents. Evidence indicates cancer is associated with poorer adherence to diabetes and other medications. Further primary research could clarify cancer 's impact on other diabetes quality indicators.
