  Chan-su ( toad venom) has been used as an analgesic agent in China from ancient to modern times. Bufalin , a non-peptide toxin extracted from toad venom , is considered as one of the analgesic components. The molecular mechanism underlying the anti-nociceptive effects of bufalin remains unclear so far. In this study , we investigated the pharmacological effects of bufalin on pain-related ion channels as well as animal models through patch clamping , calcium imaging and animal behavior observation. Using the whole-cell recording , bufalin caused remarkable suppressive effect on the peak currents of Nav channels ( voltage gated sodium channels , VGSCs) of dorsal root ganglion neuroblastomas ( ND7-23 cell) in a dose-dependent manner. Bufalin facilitated the voltage-dependent activation and induced a negative shift on the fast inactivation of VGSCs. The recovery kinetics of VGSCs were significantly slowed and the recovery proportion were reduced after administering bufalin. However , bufalin prompted no significant effect not only on Kv4 .2 , Kv4 .3 and BK channels heterologously expressed in HEK293T cells , but also on the capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanate induced Ca
