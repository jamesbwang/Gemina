  A facile and novel approach to prepare monodisperse polystyrene ( PS) particles having a `` cylindrical '' shape was discovered. Spherical PS particles prepared by dispersion polymerization were stirred in a polyvinylpyrrolidone ( PVP) aqueous solution for several hours using a magnetic stirrer at room temperature. In the presence of PVP , the spherical PS particles deformed into cylindrical shapes following stirring; however , the particles did not deform in the absence of PVP. The deformation rate of the particles was affected by the molecular weight of the dissolved PVP. This stirring method is not only highly efficient and high yielding , but also applicable to other materials such as polymethyl methacrylate. Moreover , the cylindrical particles were successfully applied as particulate surfactants in a Pickering emulsion system , which exhibited excellent stability in comparison to a system using spherical particles as a surfactant. In the first case , the emulsion was left standing for more than 4 months.
