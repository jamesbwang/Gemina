  Halomonas spp. are able to grow under a high salt concentration at alkali pH , they are able to resist contamination by other microbes. Development of Halomonas spp. as platform production strains for the next-generation industrial biotechnology ( NGIB) is intensively studied. Among Halomonas spp. , Halomonas bluephagenesis is the best studied one with available engineering tools and methods to reprogram it for production of various polyhydroxyalkanoates , proteins , and chemicals. Due to its contamination resistance , H. bluephagenesis can be grown under open and continuous processes not just in the labs but also in at least 1000 L fermentor scale. It is expected that NGIB based on Halomonas spp. be able to engineer for production of increasing number of products in a competitive manner.
