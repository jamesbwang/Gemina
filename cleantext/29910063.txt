  Few studies have reported the clinical and prognostic significance of C/EBP homologous protein ( CHOP) in advanced gastric cancer ( GC). Therefore , the present study investigated the expression of CHOP in advanced GC patients to determine its potential prognostic role. The levels of CHOP in 95 patients with advanced GC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were evaluated by qRT-PCR , western blot and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore , the association of CHOP expression with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of advanced GC patients was analyzed. The levels of CHOP were down-regulated in advanced GC compared with non-cancerous tissues ( P < 0.01). In addition , high CHOP expression more frequently occurred in advanced GC tissues with depth of invasion of T Low expression of CHOP predicts the poor prognosis of advanced GC patients , and CHOP may be a prognostic biomarker for patients with advanced GC.
