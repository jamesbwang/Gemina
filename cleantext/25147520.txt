  Comprehending natural language quantifiers ( like many , all , or some) involves linguistic and numerical abilities. However , the extent to which both factors play a role is controversial. In order to determine the specific contributions of linguistic and number skills in quantifier comprehension , we examined two groups of participants that differ in their language abilities while their number skills appear to be similar: Participants with Down syndrome<disease> ( DS) and participants with Williams syndrome<disease> ( WS). Compared to rather poor linguistic skills of individuals with DS , individuals with WS display relatively advanced language abilities. Participants with WS also outperformed participants with DS in a quantifier comprehension task while number knowledge did not differ between the two groups. When compared to typically developing ( TD) children of the same mental age , participants with WS displayed similar levels regarding quantifier abilities , but participants with DS performed worse than the control group. Language abilities but not number skills also significantly predicted quantifier knowledge in a linear regression analysis , stressing the importance of linguistic abilities for quantifier comprehension. In addition to determining the skills that are relevant for comprehending quantifiers , our findings provide the first demonstration of how quantifiers are acquired by individuals with DS and WS , an issue not investigated so far.
