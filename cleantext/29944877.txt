  Triazoles are interesting templates for novel chemotherapeutic drugs. We synthesized here 17 1,3,4-substituted-1,2,3-triazoles that differed in their 1 '- substituent ( variable alkyl chain lengths C3-C12) , the 3 '- substituent ( no substituent ,- methyl or- propyl) or the salt form obtained. Several of the compounds were cytotoxic ( Î¼M range) for tumor cells ( HL-60 , Jurkat , MCF-7 , HCT-116) , and when the effect was compared to non-transformed cells ( Vero) , selectivity ratios of up to 23-fold were obtained. To estimate the liability of these potential drug candidates for triggering neurotoxicity , we used the LUHMES cell-based NeuriTox assay. This test quantifies damage to the neurites of human neurons. The four most potent tumoricidal compounds were found to be neurotoxic in a concentration range similar to the one showing tumor cell toxicity. As the neurites of the LUHMES neurons were affected at > 4-fold lower concentrations than the overall cell viability , the novel triazoles were classified as specific neurotoxicants. The structure-activity relationship ( SAR) for neurotoxicity was sharply defined and correlated with the one for anti-neoplastic activity. Based on this SAR , two non-neurotoxic compounds were predicted , and testing in the NeuriTox assay confirmed this prediction. In summary , the panel of novel triazoles generated and characterized here , allowed to define structural features associated with cytotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Moreover , the study shows that potential neurotoxic side effects may be predicted early in drug development if highly sensitive test methods for neurite integrity are applied.
