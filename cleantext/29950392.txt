  An initiative to implement patient-centered medication labeling at 4 pharmacies within a publicly funded safety-net healthcare system is described. Medication nonadherence negatively affects patient outcomes and safety. Nonadherence has been attributed to poor understanding of instructions on medication labels. Research has demonstrated that patient-centered labeling ( PCL) can improve adherence and produce safer medication-taking practices. As part of a mixed-methods study by a safety-net health system , audits of nearly 9,000 prescription labels generated at 4 pharmacy sites , as well as interviews with 6 stakeholder informants , were conducted to determine PCL adoption rates and factors contributing to success. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze audit data; constructs of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research were used to analyze interview data. Among the 4 sites , 3 pharmacies successfully converted more than 85 % of audited prescriptions to a PCL format; 1 pharmacy converted less than 25 % of prescriptions. Barriers to implementation included pharmacists ' reluctance to modify prescriber instructions and inadequate real-time data on conversion rates. Interviewees perceived that leadership and policy directives promoted PCL conversion efforts. Successful pharmacies used adaptable software , had closer communication networks with prescribers , and/or used automation to facilitate PCL conversion. Three pharmacies successfully converted more than 85 % of labels for audited prescriptions to a PCL format; 1 pharmacy converted less than 25 % of prescriptions. Barriers to implementation included pharmacists ' reluctance to modify prescriber instructions , inadequate real-time data on conversation rates , and lack of customizable software to automate changes.
