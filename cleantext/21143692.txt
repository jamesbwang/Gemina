  Cricopharyngeal myotomy with flexible endoscope is a well-known and safe treatment for Zenker 's diverticulum. We describe hereafter how we perform this flexible endotherapy. From January 2011 to January 2017 , we treated 28 patients with this endotherapy. Our technique is described step-by-step in the paper: the main principle is to perform an endoscopic cut of the diverticular septum and cricopharyngeal muscle 's fibers ( see the video). We describe an objective measurement of the cutting length and depth of the myotomy. Technical success was achieved in all the patients. As to clinical success , 76.2 % of patients showed a significant improvement and relevant disappearance of preoperative dysphagia<symptom>. The present follow-up ranges from 6 months to 5 years. This flexible endoscopic technique can overcome some limitations of rigid endoscopic technique ( i.e. , upper teeth protrusion , inadequate jaw opening , or limited neck mobility). The main indication was based on clinical presentation and referred to the diverticular dimensions between 2 and 5 cm. Tips for the technique are described in the paper. This variant of cricopharyngeal myotomy with flexible endoscopy is feasible and effective for the treatment of Zenker 's diverticulum in selected patients.
