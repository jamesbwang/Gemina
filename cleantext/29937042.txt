  Lethal cancers have genomes that can reflect a jigsaw puzzle put together in a hurricane. The missing , misjoined , and extra pieces contribute to the driving forces behind the cancer phenotypes. But is this the only reason genomic instability is so prevalent in aggressive cancers? New findings support that the hurricane winds themselves , not just their aftermath , contribute to the cancer phenotype of metastasis.
