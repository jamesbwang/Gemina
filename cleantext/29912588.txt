  Zinc ( Zn) deficiency is the most consistently discovered nutritional manifestations of fatty liver disease. Although Zn is known to stimulate hepatic lipid oxidation , little is known about its underlying mechanism of action in lipolysis. Given the potential role of lipophagy in lipid metabolism , the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that Zn attenuates hepatic lipid accumulation by modulating lipophagy. The present study indicated that Zn is a potent promoter of lipophagy. Zn administration significantly alleviated hepatocellular lipid accumulation and increased the release of free fatty acids in association with enhanced fatty acid oxidation and inhibited lipogenesis , which was accompanied by activation of autophagy. Moreover , Zn reduced lipid accumulation and stimulated lipolysis by autophagy-mediated lipophagy. Zn-induced up-regulation of autophagy and lipid depletion is free Zn
