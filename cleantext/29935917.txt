  Writing for the media is a task faced by many professionals at some point during their academic or clinical life. The style and purpose of writing for the media is strikingly different from that of an academic manuscript. When writing for the media , the author presents information and persuades the mass audience about a particular topic or issue. The author needs to bear in mind that information sent out to the media will make today 's story but will be yesterday 's news , so time is of the essence. The format of newswriting follows an inverted pyramid structure with the most important message taking center stage at the beginning of the article followed by any additional messages. The use of graphics enhances the message. While embracing the concept of modesty , the author needs to present the newsworthy information in a complete , accurate , efficient and precise manner.
