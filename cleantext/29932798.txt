  Production and isolation of recombinant proteins are key steps in modern Molecular Biology. Expression vectors and platforms for various hosts , including both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems , have been used. In basic plant research , Arabidopsis thaliana is the central model for which a wealth of genetic and genomic resources is available , and enormous knowledge has been accumulated over the past years- especially since elucidation of its genome in 2000. However , until recently an Arabidopsis platform had been lacking for preparative-scale production of homologous recombinant proteins. We recently established an Arabidopsis-based super-expression system , and used it for a structural pilot study of a multi-subunit integral membrane protein complex. This review summarizes the benefits and further potential of the model plant system for protein productions. Nb , Nicotiana benthamiana; OT , oligosaccharyltransferase.
