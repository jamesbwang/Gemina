  Carbohydrates are appealing non-ionic surfactant head-groups as they are naturally abundant , generally biocompatible and biodegradable , and readily functionalized. Here , seven novel carbohydrate based surfactants ( CBS) have been synthesized that contain a tri-ethylene glycol ( TEG) linker between a glucose head-group and alkyl tail-group , with linear saturated ( C8-18) and unsaturated ( C18: 1) alkyl chains. The aqueous adsorption and self-assembly of these surfactants was explored using tensiometry and small- and ultra-small-angle neutron scattering ( SANS and USANS). With SANS we observed elongation from spherical to cylindrical micelles with increasing alkyl chain length. C16 and C18 chains exhibited pronounced Krafft points , yet formed worm-like micelles as single components upon heating to 43 and 48 °C respectively. The introduction of mono-unsaturation in the form of a C18: 1 chain reduced the Krafft point and gave a surfactant that produced worm-like micelles in water without additives at room temperature. We also observed micellar elongation for C12 and C14 chains at 50 °C due to dehydration<symptom> of the TEG linker. The room temperature worm-like micelles were further characterized using rheo-SANS and rheology , revealing the C18: 1 surfactant to exhibit near ideal Maxwell behavior at low concentrations ( 2.9 wt. %). These results provide insight into structure-function relationships for CBS , and demonstrate a promising molecular candidate for the formation of viscoelastic worm-like micellar solutions.
