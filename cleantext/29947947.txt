  We consider excursions for a class of stochastic processes describing a population of discrete individuals experiencing density-limited growth , such that the population has a finite carrying capacity and behaves qualitatively like the classical logistic model Verhulst ( Corresp Math Phys 10:113-121 , 1838) when the carrying capacity is large. Being discrete and stochastic , however , our population nonetheless goes extinct in finite time. We present results concerning the maximum of the population prior to extinction in the large population limit , from which we obtain establishment probabilities and upper bounds for the process , as well as estimates for the waiting time to establishment and extinction. As a consequence , we show that conditional upon establishment , the stochastic logistic process will with high probability greatly exceed carrying capacity an arbitrary number of times prior to extinction.
