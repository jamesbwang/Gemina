  Neuroblastoma survivors may be at elevated risk for psychological impairments because of their young age at diagnosis and neurotoxic treatment , but this is not well described. A total of 859 ≥ 5-year survivors of neuroblastoma younger than 18 years ( diagnosed in 1970-1999) , who had a median age at diagnosis of 0.8 years ( range: 0.0-7.3 years) and a median follow-up of 13.3 years ( range: 8.0-17.9 years) , were compared with 872 siblings of childhood cancer survivors who were younger than 18 years with the parent-reported Behavior Problem Index ( BPI) for psychological functioning. Age- and sex-adjusted multivariate log-binomial models were used to identify factors associated with impairment in BPI domains ( scores worse than the sibling 10th percentile). The impact of psychological impairment on educational outcomes was examined among survivors. Compared with siblings , neuroblastoma survivors had an increased prevalence of impairment in the domains of anxiety/depression ( 19 % vs 14 %; P = .003) , headstrong behavior ( 19 % vs 13 %; P < .001) , attention deficits ( 21 % vs 13 %; P < .001) , peer conflict/social withdrawal ( 26 % vs 17 %; P < .001) , and antisocial behavior ( 16 % vs 12 %; P = .01). Common treatment exposures ( vincristine , cisplatin , and retinoic acid) were not associated with impairment. Having 2 or more chronic health conditions predicted impairment in 4 domains ( P < .001). Specifically , pulmonary disease predicted impairment in all 5 domains ( P ≤ .004). Endocrine disease ( P ≤ .004) and peripheral neuropathy ( P ≤ .02) each predicted impairment in 3 domains. Psychological impairment was associated with special education service usage and educational attainment less than college. Neuroblastoma survivors are at elevated risk for psychological impairment , which is associated with special education service usage and lower adult educational attainment. Those with chronic health conditions may represent a high-risk group for targeted screening and intervention. Cancer 2018. © 2018 American Cancer Society.
