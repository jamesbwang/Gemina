  Tc-99m- and I-131-labeled arginine-arginine-leucine ( RRL) peptides have shown the feasibility of tumor imaging in our previous studies. However , there have been no reports using RRL peptide for positron emission tomography ( PET) imaging. In this study , RRL was radiolabeled with Ga-68 under optimized reaction conditions to develop a better specific and effective tumor imaging agent. RRL was synthesized and conjugated to a bifunctional chelating agent ( DOTA-NHS) , then radiolabeled with Ga-68. Labeling yield was optimized by varying pH , temperature , and reaction time and the stability was evaluated in human fresh serum. Cellular uptakes of ( The labeling yield of ( Our study successfully prepared (
