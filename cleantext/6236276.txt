  Increased serum autoantibodies against interleukin-2 ( anti-IL-2 autoantibodies) were reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) and in patients receiving IL-2 therapy. This study aimed to explore the clinical relevance of serum anti-IL-2 autoantibodies and the interactions between low-dose IL-2 therapy and serum anti-IL-2 autoantibodies. Serum samples were collected from 152 SLE patients and 100 age- and gender-matched healthy controls ( HCs). Among them , 75 SLE patients were followed up for 10 weeks , and all of them were treated with corticosteroids , antimalarials , and/or immunosuppressants. Forty-six out of the 75 SLE patients received low-dose IL-2 therapy additionally. Clinical and laboratory parameters were collected at baseline and week 10. Serum anti-IL-2 autoantibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Compared with HCs , median levels and positive rates of serum anti-IL-2 autoantibodies were higher in SLE patients ( 32.58 ( 23.63 , 45.23) arbitrary unit ( AU) vs. 37.54 ( 27.88 , 60.74) AU , P = 0.006 , and 5.0 % vs. 18.4 % , P = 0.002 , respectively). Compared to those without the corresponding disorders , serum anti-IL-2 autoantibody was increased in patients with alopecia ( 49.79 ( 36.06 , 64.95) AU vs. 35.06 ( 25.40 , 58.46) AU , P = 0.033) , but it was decreased in those with lupus nephritis ( 31.71 ( 22.60 , 43.25) AU vs. 44.15 ( 31.43 , 68.52) AU , P = 0.001). Moreover , serum anti-IL-2 autoantibody was positively correlated with serum IgA ( r = 0.229 , P = 0.005) , total IgG ( r = 0.327 , P < 0.001) , and total IgM ( r = 0.164 , P = 0.050). Treatment with exogenous IL-2 was not significantly associated with serum anti-IL-2 autoantibody. In addition , no significant difference was found in serum anti-IL-2 autoantibody between responders and nonresponders to low-dose IL-2 therapy. Serum anti-IL-2 autoantibody was increased and associated with disease severity in SLE. Exogenous low-dose IL-2 did not significantly induce anti-IL-2 autoantibody production.
