  Curcuminoids , the major bioactive constituents of traditional medicine known as turmeric , have exhibited extensive therapeutic benefits. Excited by violet-blue light , curcuminoids can emit native fluorescence , making them possible to be detected with high sensitivity and specificity by laser-induced native fluorescence ( LINF). Here , a commercial 445 nm laser diode was used as an excitation source to construct a confocal laser-induced fluorescence ( LIF) detector and then a complete capillary electrophoresis ( CE) system coupled with LIF detection was established. With three major curcuminoids , curcumin , demethoxy curcumin ( DMC) and bisdemethoxy curcumin ( BDMC) as target analytes , a micellar electrokinetic chromatography ( MEKC) method was proposed using mixed micelles consisting of Triton X-100 and SDS to sensitize the native fluorescence of curcuminoids and enhance their separation efficiency. Fluorescence spectra revealed that the mixed micelles induced fluorescence synergism could enhance the signals of three curcuminoids by 77- , 57- , and 47-fold for curcumin , DMC , and BDMC. After systematic investigation , the optimal separation buffer for curcuminoids was chosen as follows: 20 mM Triton X-100 , 20 mM SDS , 30 % ( v/v) methanol in 10 mM borax solution at pH 10.0. Under these conditions , a baseline separation of three curcuminoids was achieved within 10 min and the detection limits were found to be 4.1 , 2.6 , and 0.4 ng/mL for curcumin , DMC , and BDMC , respectively. Furthermore , the developed MEKC-LINF method was validated in terms of precision , linearity , accuracy and successfully applied for the determination of three curcuminoids in turmeric , medicinal turmeric liniment , curry seasoning , and human urine samples.
