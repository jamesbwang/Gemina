  Rheumatic heart disease remains a major cause of significant mortality and morbidity in the developing world. Rheumatic mitral and aortic stenosis are the two most common valvular sequelae of acute rheumatic fever<disease> Open surgical procedures with either valve replacement or surgical commissurotomy have largely been replaced by percutaneous commissurotomy and balloon valvuloplasty for selected patients since the early 1980s. The purpose of our review is to examine the literature for any recent advancement in procedural techniques of balloon valvuloplasty for selected patients with rheumatic mitral and or aortic stenosis. Our search indicates that , in general , the volume of recent publications on this important topic is rather scanty with no major changes in the fundamentals of procedural techniques and or primary indications for balloon valvuloplasty of a rheumatic valve stenosis. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty/commissurotomy remains the main stay of therapy for rheumatic valvular stenosis in selected patients with favorable valve anatomy.
