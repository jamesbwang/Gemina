  Microvascular function plays an important role in ARVD ( atherosclerotic renovascular disease). RFR ( renal flow reserve) , the capacity of renal vasculature to dilate , is known to reflect renal microvascular function. In this pilot study , we assessed PET ( positron emission tomography)- based RFR values of healthy persons and renal artery stenosis patients. Seventeen patients with ARVD and eight healthy subjects were included in the study. Intravenous enalapril 1 mg was used as a vasodilatant , and the maximum response ( blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and RFR) to it was measured at 40 min. Renal perfusion was measured by means of oxygen-15-labeled water PET. RFR was calculated as a difference of stress flow and basal flow and was expressed as percent ( ( stress blood flow- basal blood flow)/ basal blood flow) Ã— 100 %. RFR of the healthy was 22 %. RFR of the stenosed kidneys of bilateral stenosis patients ( 27 %) was higher than that of the stenosed kidneys of unilateral stenosis patients ( 15 %). RFR of the contralateral kidneys of unilateral stenosis patients was 21 %. There was no difference of statistical significance between RFR values of ARVD subgroups or between ARVD subgroups and the healthy. In the stenosed kidneys of unilateral ARVD patients , stenosis grade of the renal artery correlated negatively with basal ( p = 0.04) and stress flow ( p = 0.02). Dispersion of RFR values was high. This study is the first to report (
