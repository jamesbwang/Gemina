  Current diagnostic ECG criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy in obese patients are still lacking. To assess the current ECG diagnostic criteria of LVH , and to validate our previously proposed criteria in a group of patients with morbid obesity. A group of consecutive 429 obese patients ( MOP) with BMI of at least 35 kg/m The diagnosis of LVH in MOPs was confirmed only by RaVL of 7.5 mm , Cornell index of 12.5 mm; Cornell index × QRS duration of 1,125 mm × ms and Romhilt-Estes score of 1. None of the criteria proposed to date is appropriate in super-morbidly obese patients. Our study confirmed that none of the currently used voltage-based ECG criteria is appropriate for diagnosing LVH in morbidly obese patients. Further studies are required.
