  We present an interesting case of accidental overdose of latanoprost eye drops. A 71-year-old patient underwent an uncomplicated cataract surgery in his right eye. During the first postsurgical week he mistakenly used latanoprost eye drops six times daily instead of the prescribed tobramycin/dexamethasone eye drops. The patient experienced gradually decreasing visual acuity and was diagnosed with cystoid macular edema<symptom> seven weeks after surgery. The cystoid macular edema<symptom> resolved 4 weeks later after treatment with nepafenac 0.3 % eye drops and oral acetazolamide. The cystoid macular edema<symptom> recurred 2 weeks after rechallenge with latanoprost. The rechallenge-induced cystoid macular edema<symptom> once again resolved after cessation of latanoprost and retreatment with nepafenac eye drops. A Naranjo assessment score of 7 was obtained , indicating a probable relationship between the patient 's symptoms and the suspect drug.
