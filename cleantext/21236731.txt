  Search for alternate pain medications has gained more importance in the past few years due to adverse effects associated with currently prescribed drugs including nervous system dysfunction with opioids , gastrointestinal discomfort with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , and cardiovascular anomalies with cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2) inhibitors. Phytomedicine has been explored for the treatment of pain , as these have been used for generations in regional communities and tend to lack major side effects in general. One such phytomedicine , incarvillateine ( INCA) , derived from the Chinese herb Dimers of cinnamic acid ( INCA analogs) were synthesized using cavitand-mediated photodimerization ( CMP) method , which utilizes a macromolecule ( Î³-cyclodextrin) to control excited state reactivity of photoactive compounds. Acute<symptom> pain<symptom> response was assessed by using formalin-induced licking behavior in hind paw of mice , and neurologic function was monitored through locomotor activity , mechanical hyperalgesia , and thermal sensitivity upon administration of test compound. For mechanistic studies , binding to adenosine receptor was determined by using computer modeling. Ferulic acid dimer ( FAD) , which has the same chemical functionalities on the aromatic ring as INCA , showed significant suppression of formalin-induced acute<symptom> pain<symptom>. Antinociceptive effect was observed primarily in the inflammatory phase , and no apparent behavioral changes related to the nervous system were noticeable. Inhibition of opioid receptor did not reverse antinociceptive response , and modeling data suggest adenosine 3 receptor binding. FAD ( INCA analog) shows potent nonopioid antinociceptive action mediated predominantly through
