  Three dimensional ultrasound ( 3-D US) imaging methods based on 2-D array probes are increasingly investigated. However , the experimental test of new 3-D US approaches is contrasted by the need of controlling very large numbers of probe elements. Although this problem may be overcome by the use of 2-D sparse arrays , just a few experimental results have so far corroborated the validity of this approach. In this paper , we experimentally compare the performance of a fully wired 1024-element ( 32 Ã— 32) array , assumed as reference , to that of a 256-element random and of an `` optimized '' 2-D sparse array , in both focused and compounded diverging wave ( DW) transmission modes. The experimental results in 3-D focused mode show that the resolution and contrast produced by the optimized sparse array are close to those of the full array while using 25 % of elements. Furthermore , the experimental results in 3-D DW mode and 3-D focused mode are also compared for the first time and they show that both the contrast and the resolution performance are higher when using the 3-D DW at volume rates up to 90/second which represent a 36x speed up factor compared to the focused mode.
