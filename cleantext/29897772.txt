  An efficient and redox-neutral synthesis of 2 H-chromene-3-carboxylic acids from N-phenoxyacetamides and methyleneoxetanones has been realized via a solvent-controlled and rhodium ( III)- catalyzed C-H activation/unusual ( 3 + 3) annulation sequence. This transformation represents the first example of using an α-methylene-β-lactone unit as the three-carbon source in transition-metal-catalyzed C-H activations through selective alkyl C-O bond cleavage. Synthetic applications and mechanistic details , including further derivatization of 2 H-chromene-3-carboxylic acids , the isolation and identification of a five-membered rhodacycle , as well as the theoretical studies for reasoning a plausible Rh ( III)- Rh ( V)- Rh ( III) process , have also been discussed.
