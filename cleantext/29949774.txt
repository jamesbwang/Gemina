  The question of whether retained histones in the sperm genome localize to gene-coding regions or gene deserts has been debated for years. Previous contradictory observations are likely caused by the non-uniform sensitivity of sperm chromatin to micrococcal nuclease ( MNase) digestion. Sperm chromatin has a highly condensed but heterogeneous structure and is composed of 90 % ∼ 99 % protamines and 1 % ∼ 10 % histones. In this study , we utilized nucleoplasmin ( NPM) to improve the solubility of sperm chromatin by removing protamines in vitro. NPM treatment efficiently solubilized histones while maintaining quality and quantity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing ( ChIP-seq) analyses using NPM-treated sperm demonstrated the predominant localization of H4 to distal intergenic regions , whereas modified histones exhibited a modification-dependent preferential enrichment in specific genomic elements , such as H3K4me3 at CpG-rich promoters and H3K9me3 in satellite repeats , respectively , implying the existence of machinery protecting modified histones from eviction.
