  Following breast and lung cancers , renal cell carcinoma ( RCC) is the third most frequent cancer to metastasize to the head and neck region , though such cases are rarely reported. Distinguishing between malignant tumors of salivary gland origin and metastatic RCC is very important. The case of a 75-year-old man with an oral cavity lesion<symptom> in the left buccal submucosa measuring 40 Ã— 30 mm that had grown substantially over several weeks is presented. His medical history included left kidney cancer 26 years earlier and a malignant myoepithelioma of the left buccal region 7 years earlier. It was suspected that this lesion<symptom> was a recurrent malignant myoepithelioma as it appeared at the same site as the previous operation. Surgery was performed , and metastatic RCC was confirmed upon pathological examination. The diagnosis of metastatic RCC was made by immunohistochemical examination , which also excluded malignant myoepithelioma and other clear cell carcinomas of salivary gland origin. Metastatic RCC must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a new oral cavity lesion<symptom> presenting in a patient with a past history of kidney cancer. Thus , immunohistochemical staining is required to distinguish malignancies of salivary gland origin , including malignant myoepithelioma , from metastatic RCC.
