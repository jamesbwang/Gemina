  Tobacco smoking is a risk factor for tuberculosis<disease> but little is known about the relationship between tobacco smoking and drug-resistant tuberculosis<disease> ( DR-TB). We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the association between DR-TB and tobacco smoking. We searched for relevant studies in the Ovid MEDLINE , Embase , Cochrane Library , Web of Science , China National Knowledge Infrastructure , WANFANG , and WEIPU data-bases from inception to September 1 , 2017. Results were expressed as odds ratios ( ORs) with accompanying 95 % CIs , and subgroup analyses were performed by study design , smoking type , DR-TB type , and multivariate analysis. Thirty-three studies related to tobacco smoking and DR-TB were included. We found substantial evidence that tobacco smoking is associated with an increased risk of DR-TB ( OR 1.57 , 95 % CI 1.33-1.86). Associations were also found in subgroup analyses: for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis<disease> ( OR 1.49 , 95 % CI 1.19-1.86) and for any DR-TB ( OR 1.70 , 95 % CI 1.3-2.23); the pooled OR was 1.45 ( 95 % CI 1.11-1.90) for current smoking , 2.25 ( 95 % CI 1.46-3.47) for past smoking , and 1.56 ( 95 % CI 1.22-1.98) for smoking history; and similar ORs were also observed in study design and multivariate analysis subgroup analysis. This study demonstrated that tobacco smoking is an independent risk factor for DR-TB.
