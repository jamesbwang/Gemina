  A straightforward method for the electrochemical C-H cyanation of arenes and heteroarenes that proceeds at room temperature in MeOH , with NaCN as the reagent in a simple , open , undivided electrochemical cell is reported. The platinum electrodes are passivated by adsorbed cyanide , which allows conversion of an exceptionally broad range of electron-rich substrates all the way down to dialkyl arenes. The cyanide electrolyte can be replenished with HCN , opening opportunities for salt-free industrial C-H cyanation.
