  The pathological Aβ aggregates associated with Alzheimer 's disease follow a nucleation-dependent path of formation. A nucleus represents an oligomeric assembly of Aβ peptides that acts as a template for subsequent incorporation of monomers to form a fibrillar structure. Nuclei can form de novo or via surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation , and the combined rates of elongation and nucleation control the overall rate of fibril formation. Transthyretin ( TTR) obstructs Aβ fibril formation in favor of alternative non-fibrillar assemblies , but the mechanism behind this activity is not fully understood. This study shows that TTR does not significantly disturb fibril elongation; rather , it effectively interferes with the formation of oligomeric nuclei. We demonstrate that this interference can be modulated by altering the relative contribution of elongation and nucleation , and we show how TTR 's effects can range from being essentially ineffective to almost complete inhibition of fibril formation without changing the concentration of TTR or monomeric Aβ.
