  To review the extent of treatment success or failure with the xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitors allopurinol and febuxostat and indicate how the dosage of urate-lowering therapy ( ULT) may be modified to increase the response in the majority of patients with gout. Gout flares are associated with serum concentrations of urate above 0.42 mmol/L ( 7 mg/dL). Achieving and maintaining serum urate below 0.36 mmol/L is considered an effective response to ULT. On an intention to treat basis , clinical trials indicate that allopurinol at daily doses of 100 to 300 mg decreases serum urate adequately in only about 40 % of gout patients while febuxostat 80 mg daily reduces serum urate adequately in approximately 70 % of gout patients. Higher doses of ULT may be required in patients receiving concomitant diuretics. The addition of a uricosuric agent to allopurinol and febuxostat therapy significantly increases the proportion of patients achieving adequate lowering of serum urate. Finally , carriers of a genetic variant of the transporter , ABCG2 ( BCRP) , have a decreased response to allopurinol. Careful examination of medication adherence , titration of doses , and the addition of uricosuric agents increase the percentage of patients responding to allopurinol and febuxostat.
