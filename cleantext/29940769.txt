  It was proved that maternally expressed 3 ( MEG3) , a long non-coding RNA ( LncRNA) , is down-regulated and inversely correlated with the prognosis in various types of cancer , including bladder cancer ( BC). Nevertheless , the role of MEG3 in BC has not been fully elaborated. Here , we found that MEG3 expression was reduced in 21 BC tumor tissue samples compared with the corresponding adjacent tissues. Then , we established T24 and 5637 cells with a stably integrated expression of MEG3 by G418 resistance screening. Our data showed that the BC cells overexpressing MEG3 displayed weaker migration and invasion ability than the control cells. The expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP) 2 and MMP9 were down-regulated if MEG3 was overexpressed. Moreover , MEG3 overexpression sensitized BC cells to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin ( DDP). DDP treatment significantly induced cell apoptosis , down-regulated bcl2 expression , and up-regulated cleaved-caspase-3 and bax expression in BC cells of MEG3 overexpression. In addition , MEG3 and p53 could stimulate the expression of each other in BC cells , indicating a potential positive feedback loop of MEG3 and p53. Taken together , our results suggest that the overexpression of MEG3 inhibits migration and invasion and enhances DDP chemosensitivity of BC cells.
