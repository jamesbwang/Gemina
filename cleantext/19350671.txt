  To date , early developmental ablation of leptin receptor ( LepRb) expression from circumscribed populations of hypothalamic neurons ( e.g. , arcuate nucleus ( ARC) Pomc- or Agrp-expressing cells) has only minimally affected energy balance<symptom>. In contrast , removal of LepRb from at least two large populations ( expressing vGat or Nos1) spanning multiple hypothalamic regions produced profound obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Thus , we tested the notion that the total number of leptin-responsive hypothalamic neurons ( rather than specific subsets of cells with a particular molecular or anatomical signature) subjected to early LepRb deletion might determine energy balance<symptom>. We generated new mouse lines deleted for LepRb in ARC Ghrh The early developmental deletion of LepRb from vGat or Nos1 neurons produced dramatic obesity , but deletion of LepRb from Pomc , Agrp , Ghrh , or Htr2c neurons minimally altered energy balance<symptom>. Although early developmental deletion of LepRb from known populations of ARC neurons fails to substantially alter body<symptom> weight , the minimal phenotype of mice lacking LepRb in Htr2c cells suggests that the phenotype that results from early developmental LepRb deficiency depends not simply upon the total number of leptin-responsive hypothalamic LepRb cells. Rather , specific populations of LepRb neurons must play particularly important roles in body energy homeostasis; these as yet unidentified LepRb cells likely reside in the DMH.
