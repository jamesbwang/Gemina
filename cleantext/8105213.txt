  Graves ophthalmopathy ( GO) is an autoimmune disorder and the most frequent extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves ' disease. GO is an inflammatory process leading to an increased volume of the extraocular muscles and orbital connective and adipose tissues associated with multiple histopathological changes. Despite recent progress in the understanding of its pathogenesis , GO often remains a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. It has become increasingly important to classify patients into categories based on disease severity and activity. Low doses of radiotherapy ( RT) have demonstrated a benefit in the treatment of moderate-to-severe GO with very few side effects. New RT techniques deliver a more conformal dose distribution to the target and decrease the dose to normal healthy tissue minimizing the risk of side effects. In this review we briefly analyzed the pathogenesis of GO and discussed the most relevant therapeutic approaches , with particular emphasis in the new RT technics. Appropriately designed and powered clinical studies are necessary to determine the most effective treatment with the lowest risk of side effects.
