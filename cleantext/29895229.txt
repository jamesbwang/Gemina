  As the aging population , including frail older people , continues to grow in Mainland China , quality of life and end-of-life care for frail older people has attracted much attention. Advance care planning is an effective way to improve end-of-life care for people with advanced diseases , and it is widely used in developed countries; however , it is a new concept in Mainland China. The effects of advance care planning and its acceptability in Mainland China are uncertain because of its culture-sensitive characteristics. The objective of this article is to discuss the serious social issue of caring for frail older people and illustrate the possibility of implementing advance care planning in nursing homes in Mainland China through a review of relevant literature , which will focus on legislation , healthcare system engagement , public engagement , and cultural issues. Recommendations to promote and implement advance care planning include choosing nursing homes as a proper setting , establishing an ethical climate , and enhancing public awareness.
