  No consensus exists on treatment of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP)- related , retroperitoneal duodenal perforations. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of post-ERCP retroperitoneal periampullary ( type 2) duodenal perforations and the clinical outcome of non-surgical management. Patients who underwent ERCP in our institution during the period from January 1 , 2009 to December 31 , 2017 were included. Any cases of retroperitoneal periampullary duodenal ( type 2) perforation were identified. Relevant data ( patient characteristics , indications , radiographic findings , time to diagnosis and surgery , surgical procedures , hospital stay and outcome) were retrospectively collected and reviewed. Results were compared to those from the existing literature. There were 24 patients with retroperitoneal type 2 duodenal perforation following 4,196 ERCPs were identified ( 24/4196 , 0.57 %) over the 9-year period. ERCP indications were: choledocholithiasis , obstructive jaundice and ampullectomy ( ampullary adenoma). Diagnosis ( aided by CT scan) was established within the first 12 h in the majority of patients ( 21/24 , 87.5 %) and intraprocedural in 3/24 , ( 12.5 %). Twelve patients ( 50 %) with deteriorating clinical course were managed with CT-guided percutaneous drainage. Surgical intervention was required in two ( 8.3 %). Overall mortality was 4.2 % , 1/24 ( one patient died after surgery). Retroperitoneal duodenal perforation is a rare and severe ERCP complication. However , conservative management is feasible in the majority of cases.
