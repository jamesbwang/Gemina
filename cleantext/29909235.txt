  Regulation of prostate cancer by androgen and androgen receptor ( AR) , and blockade of AR signaling by AR antagonists and steroidogenic enzyme inhibitors have been extensively studied. G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs) are a family of membrane receptors that regulate almost all physiological processes. Nearly 40 % of FDA-approved drugs in the market target GPCRs. A variety of GPCRs that mediate reproductive function have been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of prostate cancer. These GPCRs include gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor , luteinizing hormone receptor , follicle-stimulating hormone receptor , relaxin receptor , ghrelin receptor , and kisspeptin receptor. We highlight here GPCR regulation of prostate cancer by these GPCRs. Further therapeutic approaches targeting these GPCRs for the treatment of prostate cancer are summarized.
