  Despite evidence highlighting the importance of the forearm flexor muscles of elite baseball players , no studies have reported on the epidemiology of flexor strains and their associated outcomes. To examine the incidence , associated injuries , and outcomes associated with forearm flexor injuries among major and minor league baseball players. Cohort study; Level of evidence , 3. Injury data attributed to forearm flexor injuries among Major League Baseball ( MLB) and minor league teams between 2010 and 2014 were obtained from the professional baseball Health and Injury Tracking System. This analysis included the number of players injured , seasonal timing of injury , days spent on the disabled list ( DL) , preinjury performance data , and subsequent injuries. A total of 134 and 629 forearm flexor injuries occurred in MLB and the minor leagues , respectively. The mean player age was 28.6 and 22.8 years in the MLB and minor leagues , respectively. The mean time spent on the DL for MLB players was 117.0 days , as opposed to 93.9 days in the minor leagues ( P = .272). Interestingly , pitcher performance declined in all categories examined leading up to the season of injury , with significant differences in walks plus hits per inning pitched ( P = .04) and strike percentage ( P = .036). Of MLB players with a forearm injury , subsequent injuries included 50 ( 37.3 %) shoulder , 48 ( 35.8 %) elbow , and 24 ( 17.9 %) forearm injuries. Among injured minor league players , subsequent injuries included 170 ( 27.0 %) shoulder , 156 ( 24.8 %) elbow , and 83 ( 13.2 %) forearm injuries. These rates of subsequent injuries were significantly higher compared with the rates of injuries sustained among players without forearm injuries in both leagues ( P < .001). Finally , 26 ( 19.4 %) MLB and 56 ( 8.9 %) minor league players required an ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction , rates that were significantly higher compared with players without a flexor strain ( P < .001). Flexor-pronator injuries are responsible for considerable time spent on the DL for elite players in MLB and the minor leagues. The most significant findings of this investigation illustrate that a flexor strain may be a significant risk factor for subsequent upper extremity injuries , including an ulnar collateral ligament tear.
