  Neonatal percutaneous carotid access is a safe technique that compares favorably to neonatal surgical carotid access. Mid-term ultrasound and angiographic follow after percutaneous carotid access shows 100 % vessel patency rate with no severe stenoses or aneurysms<disease> detected. Mild stenosis ( < 12 %) is frequent at follow up ( 35 %) , the clinical significance of which is unknown.
