  A previous study revealed that the inclusion of grape pomace ( GP) in the diet for growing lambs had beneficial effects on the redox status and fecal microbiota. Herein , we investigated the effect of GP inclusion on performance , carcass traits and fatty acid composition of meat. In the experimental trial of 55 days , lambs were fed with standard or diet supplemented with GP. Performance , carcass traits and fatty acid profile of quadriceps muscle were assessed. GP inclusion in the diet improved growth performance , since the average daily gain was significantly increased by 2-fold in GP group. Regarding the fatty acid composition of meat , GP inclusion significantly increased the content of long chain n-3 fatty acids , eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid , and reduced the n-6/ n-3 ratio compared to the control group. GP supplementation in lamb diet may improve performance and may have beneficial effects on meat quality.
