  Meta-biomaterials exhibit unprecedented or rare combinations of properties not usually found in nature. Such unusual mechanical , mass transport , and biological properties could be used to develop novel categories of orthopedic implants with superior performance , otherwise known as meta-implants. Here , we use bi-stable elements working on the basis of snap-through instability to design deployable meta-implants. Deployable meta-implants are compact in their retracted state , allowing them to be brought to the surgical site with minimum invasiveness. Once in place , they are deployed to take their full-size load-bearing shape. We designed five types of meta-implants by arranging bi-stable elements in such a way to obtain a radially-deployable structure , three types of auxetic structures , and an axially-deployable structure. The intermediate stable conditions (
