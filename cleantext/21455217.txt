  This study is aimed to explore the regulatory effect of lncRNA HOTAIR/miR -148 a/DLGAP1 axis on head and neck tumor ( HNT) cell growth , cell mobility , and invasiveness. HOTAIRM1 , miR-148a , and DLGAP1 level in HNT tissues and adjacent normal tissues were measured by qRT-PCR. Cell Counting Kit-8 ( CCK-8) and Transwell ( migration and invasion) assay were used to survey the influence of HOTAIRM1 , miR-148a , and DLGAP1 on Fadu cells. Nude mouse xenograft was utilized to validate the influence of HOTAIRM1 in vivo. Dual-luciferase reporter assay confirms the relationship between HOTAIRM1 and miR-148a , miR-148a , and DLGAP1. The expression level of HOTAIRM1 was downregulated in human HNT tissues and cells. Overexpression of HOTAIRM1 significantly moderated Fadu cells proliferation , apoptosis , migration , and invasion in vitro and impaired the tumorigenesis in vivo. The expression level of miR-148a was upregulated in human HNT tissue compared to the adjacent tissues. We identified that miR-148a was a target of HOTAIRM1 and its expression levels were reduced by HOTAIRM1. Transfection of miR-148a mimics increased proliferation , migration , and invasion of Fadu cells. DLGAP1 was identified as a novel target of miR-148a and its expression level was promoted by either HOTAIRM1 overexpression or miR-148a knockdown. Overexpression of DLGAP1 also facilitated the cell viability and metastasis of Fadu cells. HOTAIRM1 was confirmed as a tumor suppressor via sponging miR-148a and promote the expression of DLGAP1 , which could be regarded as an important target for the prevention and treatment of HNT.
