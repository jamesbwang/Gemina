  Cold dark matter is a crucial constituent of the current concordance cosmological model. Having a vanishing equation of state ( EOS) , its energy density scales with the inverse cosmic volume and is thus uniquely described by a single number , its present abundance. We test the inverse cosmic volume law for dark matter ( DM) by allowing its EOS to vary independently in eight redshift bins in the range z = 10 ^ ( 5) and z = 0. We use the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation from the Planck satellite and supplement them with baryon acoustic oscillation ( BAO) data from the 6dF and SDSS-III BOSS surveys and with the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST) key project data. We find no evidence for nonzero EOS in any of the eight redshift bins. With Planck data alone , the DM abundance is most strongly constrained around matter-radiation equality ω _ ( g) ^ ( eq) = 0.1193 _ ( -0.0035) ^ ( +0.0036) ( 95 % C.L.) , whereas its present-day value is more weakly constrained: ω _ ( g) ^ ( ( 0)) = 0.16 _ ( -0.10) ^ ( +0.12) ( 95 % C.L.). Adding BAO or HST data does not significantly change the ω _ ( g) ^ ( eq) constraint , while ω _ ( g) ^ ( ( 0)) tightens to 0.160 _ ( -0.065) ^ ( +0.069) ( 95 % C.L.) and 0.124 _ ( -0.067) ^ ( +0.081) ( 95 % C.L.) , respectively. Our results constrain for the first time the level of `` coldness '' required of the DM across various cosmological epochs and show that the DM abundance is strictly positive at all times.
