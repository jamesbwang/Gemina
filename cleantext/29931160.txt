  A significant proportion of readmissions occur at a different hospital than the index admission , and are thus missed by current quality metrics. No study has examined all-hospital adult 30-day readmission rates , including to different hospitals , following burn injury across the US. The purpose of this study was to evaluate nationwide readmission rates , potential risk factors and ultimately the burden of burn injury readmission , including readmission to a different hospital. The 2010-2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database was queried for patients admitted for burn. Multivariate logistic regression identified risk factors and associated cost for 30-day readmission at index and different hospitals. Previously unreported , 1 in 3 burn readmissions nationally occur at a different hospital , have unique risk factors , and are costlier. Current hospital benchmarking underestimates readmission by failing to capture this unique subpopulation.
