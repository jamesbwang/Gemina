  In order to calibrate the spatial phase response nonuniformity of liquid crystal on silicon ( LCoS) , we propose to use a Twyman-Green interferometer to characterize the wavefront distortion , due to the inherent curvature of the device. During the characterization , both the residual carrier frequency introduced by the Fourier transform evaluation method and the lens aberration are error sources. For the tilted phase error introduced by residual carrier frequency , the least mean square fitting method is used to obtain the tilted phase error. Meanwhile , we use Zernike polynomials fitting based on plane mirror calibration to mitigate the lens aberration. For a typical LCoS with 1 × 12,288 pixels after calibration , the peak-to-valley value of the inherent wavefront distortion is approximately 0.25 λ at 1550 nm , leading to a half-suppression of wavefront distortion. All efforts can suppress the root mean squares value of the inherent wavefront distortion to approximately λ/34.
