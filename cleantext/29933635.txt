  The detection of the toxic gas carbon monoxide ( CO) in the low ppm range is required in different applications. We present a study of the reactivity of different gasochromic rhodium complexes towards the toxic gas carbon monoxide ( CO). Therefore , variations of binuclear rhodium complexes with different ligands were prepared. They were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy , ยน H NMR spectroscopy , and differential scanning calorimetry. All complexes are spectroscopically distinguishable and temperature stable up to at least 187 & deg; C. The gasochromic behavior of all different compounds was tested. Therefore , the compounds were dissolved in toluene and exposed to 100 ppm CO for 10 min to investigate their gas sensitivity and reaction velocity. The changes in the transmission spectra were recorded by UV/vis spectroscopy. Furthermore , a significant influence of the solvent to the color dyes & rsquo; gasochromic reaction and behavior was observed. After characterization , one complex was transferred as sensing element into an optical gas sensor. Two different measurement principles ( reflection- and waveguide-based) were built up and tested towards their capability as gasochromic CO sensors. Finally , different gas-dependent measurements were carried out.
