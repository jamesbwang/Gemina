  Proper assessment of pain is essential to allow for safe and compassionate care of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU). The Neonatal Infant Pain Scale ( NIPS) used in an urban level IV NICU addresses acute<symptom> pain<symptom> but may not adequately measure chronic neonatal pain. The purpose of this quality improvement study was to improve acute and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> measurements for neonates in an NICU through implementation of the Neonatal Pain , Agitation , and Sedation Scale ( N-PASS). An evidence search for a comprehensive tool to assess neonatal pain in the setting of a 45-bed level IV NICU was completed. The N-PASS was found to be inclusive of measuring acute and chronic neonatal pain. Participants for a quality improvement study , including NICU nurses and providers , were educated on the N-PASS. Nurses documented in the N-PASS and the NIPS during routine pain assessments for NICU infants for comparison. Participants completed a survey assessing knowledge of the N-PASS. When compared , the N-PASS generated 98 % of pain scores greater than the NIPS. Surveys demonstrated an increase in staff knowledge for the N-PASS. Implementation of a multidimensional pain tool that measures acute and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> is essential for proper pain assessment. Providers can manage neonatal pain when accurate documentation is available. Further research evaluating guided management of acute and chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> scores on the N-PASS would aid hospital policies on therapies for neonatal pain.
