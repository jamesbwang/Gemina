  The thermostable Geobacillus stearothermophilus GsI-IIC intron is among the few bacterial group II introns found to proliferate to high copy number in its host genome. Here , we developed a bacterial genetic assay for retrohoming and biochemical assays for protein-dependent and self-splicing of GsI-IIC. We found that GsI-IIC , like other group IIC introns , retrohomes into sites having a 5 '- exon DNA hairpin , typically from a bacterial transcription terminator , followed by short intron-binding sequences ( IBSs) recognized by base pairing of exon-binding sequences ( EBSs) in the intron RNA. Intron RNA insertion occurs preferentially but not exclusively into the parental lagging strand at DNA replication forks , using a nascent lagging strand DNA as a primer for reverse transcription. In vivo mobility assays , selections , and mutagenesis indicated that a variety of GC-rich DNA hairpins of 7-19 bp with continuous base pairs or internal elbow regions support efficient intron mobility and identified a critically recognized nucleotide ( T-5) between the hairpin and IBS1 , a feature not reported previously for group IIC introns. Neither the hairpin nor T-5 is required for intron excision or lariat formation during RNA splicing , but the 5 '- exon sequence can affect the efficiency of exon ligation. Structural modeling suggests that the 5 '- exon DNA hairpin and T-5 bind to the thumb and DNA-binding domains of GsI-IIC reverse transcriptase. This mode of DNA target site recognition enables the intron to proliferate to high copy number by recognizing numerous transcription terminators and then finding the best match for the EBS/IBS interactions within a short distance downstream.
