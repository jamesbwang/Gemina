  Food allergies affect some 15 million Americans. The only treatment for food allergies is a strict avoidance diet. To help ensure the reliability of food labels , analytical methods are employed; the most common being enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISAs). However , the commonly employed ELISAs are single analyte-specific and can not distinguish between false positives due to cross-reactive homologous proteins; making the method of questionable utility for regulatory purposes when analyzing for unknown or multiple food allergens. Also , should the need arise to detect additional analytes , extensive research must be undertaken to develop new ELISAs. To address these and other limitations , a multiplex immunoassay , the xMAP Â® food allergen detection assay ( xMAP FADA) , was developed using 30 different antibodies against 14 different food allergens plus gluten. Besides incorporating two antibodies for the detection of most analytes , the xMAP FADA also relies on two different extraction protocols; providing multiple confirmatory end-points. Using the xMAP FADA , the cross-reactivities of 45 botanicals used in dietary supplements and spices commercially sold in the USA were assessed. Only a few displayed cross-reactivities with the antibodies in the xMAP FADA at levels exceeding 0.0001 %. The utility of the xMAP FADA was exemplified by its ability to detect and distinguish between betel nut , saw palmetto , and acai which are in the same family as coconut. Other botanicals examined included allspice , amchur , anise seed , black pepper , caraway seed , cardamom , cayenne red pepper , sesame seed , poppy seed , white pepper , and wheat grass. The combination of direct antibody detection , multi-antibody profiling , high sensitivity , and a modular design made it possible for the xMAP FADA to distinguish between homologous antigens , provide multiple levels of built-in confirmatory analysis , and optimize the bead set cocktail to address specific needs.
