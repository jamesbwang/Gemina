  It is shown that the impedance spectroscopy allows identification of the resistive switching mechanisms in complex composite structures. This statement was demonstrated on an example of organic based sandwich structures with a modified polymer matrix as an active element. The impedance spectroscopy scanning was performed for a series of intermediate states formed within the switching process. Analysis of the experimentally obtained impedance spectra shows that the electron transport is provided by delocalized charge carriers and proceeds via conducting filaments formed in a highly resistive matrix. The filament configuration changes during the switching. With the shift from isolating to conducting states , single isolated filaments are reorganized into a branched network.
