  The effects of visceral fat accumulation on the renal damage have drawn much attention. We aimed to investigate the possible relationship between visceral adiposity and albuminuria. We included information from a population-based study in 9473 subjects aged 40 years or older. As a novel and valid indicator for visceral adipose function , visceral adiposity index ( VAI) was determined by gender-specific equations and calculated using simple anthropometric and functional parameters. Increased urinary albumin excretion was defined as albumin-to-creatinine ratio ( ACR) 30 mg/g or greater. The prevalence rate of increased urinary albumin excretion was 6.6 % in this population and gradually increased across VAI quartiles. Participants with higher VAI had elevated age , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , cholesterol , fasting insulin and decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) level. In multivariate logistic regression analysis , the adjusted odds ratios ( ORs) of increased urinary albumin excretion for increasing VAI quartiles were 1.00 ( reference) , 1.29 ( 95 % confidence intervals ( CI) 0.94-1.76) , 1.46 ( 95 % CI 1.08-1.97) and 1.79 ( 95 % CI 1.33-2.41). In subgroup analysis and after multiple adjustments , significant relation between VAI level and prevalent increased urinary albumin excretion was detected in women , younger subjects , non-obesity subjects , those without diabetes and those with eGFR â‰¥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m Visceral fat accumulation evaluating by VAI is independently associated with increased urinary albumin excretion in middle-aged and elderly Chinese.
