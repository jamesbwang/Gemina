  The lettuce aphid , Nasonovia ribisnigri , and western flower thips , Frankliniella occidentalis , are quarantine pests of lettuce in Asian markets and , therefore , require treatments on lettuce exported from USA to Japan and Taiwan respectively. Nitric oxide ( NO) is a newly discovered fumigant for postharvest pest control and has been demonstrated safe to fresh fruit and vegetables. In this study , small-scale NO fumigations were conducted to determine effective treatments and large-scale confirmatory tests were conducted to determine the efficacy against N. ribisnigri and F. occidentalis on commercially packed lettuce. The safety of NO fumigation to postharvest quality of lettuce was also evaluated. In small-scale experiments , complete control of N. ribisnigri was achieved in 3 , 8 , and 16 h fumigations with 2.0 % , 1.0 % , and 0.5 % NO respectively at 2 °C on both iceberg and romaine lettuce. In a large-scale experiment , complete control of both N. ribisnigri and F. occidentalis was achieved in a 16 h fumigation with 0.5 % NO at 2 °C. The fumigation treatment had no effect on either external or internal postharvest quality of lettuce at 14 days after treatment. NO fumigation was demonstrated to be effective against both N. ribisnigri and F. occidentalis and safe to lettuce quality in large-scale fumigations of commercially packed lettuce. The study suggests that NO fumigation has potential to be an alternative treatment to methyl bromide for postharvest pest control on harvested lettuce. This article is protected by copyright.
