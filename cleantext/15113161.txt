  Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated the cholesterol-lowering potential of β-caryophyllene in a rat model. Hypercholesterolemia was induced by feeding male Wistar rats a high cholesterol and fat diet for 2 weeks. This was followed by oral administration of β-caryophyllene to hypercholesterolemic rats at 30 , 100 and 300 mg/kg b.w. for 4 weeks. A dose of 30 mg/kg of β-caryophyllene significantly lowered serum total cholesterol , low density lipoprotein and the atherogenic index and significantly increased high density lipoprotein level. Moreover , it ameliorated liver injury as evidenced by decreasing hepatomegaly , macrovesicular steatosis and the activity of hepatic marker enzymes alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Furthermore , it increased the activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase. This dose of β-caryophyllene significantly inhibited the activity of hepatic hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. Higher doses ( 100 and 300 mg/kg) of β-caryophyllene , however , did not induce significant beneficial effects on the studied parameters. These observations demonstrate that β-caryophyllene has a cholesterol-lowering effect on hypercholesterolemic rats , thus offering protection against hypercholesterolemia-induced diseases such as atherosclerosis and fatty liver.
