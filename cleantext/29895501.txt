  Cancer immunotherapy with dendritic cell ( DC)- based vaccines has been used to treat various malignancies for more than two decades , however generally showed a limited clinical success. Among various factors responsible for their modest clinical activity is the lack of universally applied , standardized protocols for the generation of clinical-grade DC vaccines , capable of inducing effective anti-tumor immune responses. We investigated Bacterial Ghosts ( BGs)- empty envelopes of Gram-negative bacteria- as a tool for optimized production of DC vaccines. BGs possess various intact cell surface structures , exhibiting strong adjuvant properties required for the induction of DC maturation , whereas their empty internal space can be easily filled with a source tumor antigens , e.g. tumor lysate. Hence BGs emerge as an excellent platform for both the induction of immunogenic DC maturation and loading with tumor antigens in a single-step procedure. We compared the phenotype , cytokine secretion profile , functional activity and ability to induce immunogenic T-cell responses in vitro of human monocyte-derived DCs generated using BG platform and DCs matured with widely used lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) plus interferon-Î³ cocktail and loaded with tumor lysate. Both approaches induced DC maturation , however BG-based protocol was superior to LPS-based protocol in terms of the ability to induce DCs with a lower tolerogenic potential , resulting in a more robust CD8
