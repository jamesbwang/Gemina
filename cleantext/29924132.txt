  Synthetic polyploids are key breeding materials for watermelon. Compared with diploid watermelon , the tetraploid watermelon often exhibit wide phenotypic differences and differential gene expression. Digital gene expression ( DGE) profile technique was performed in this study to present gene expression patterns in an autotetraploid and its progenitor diploid watermelon , and deferentially expressed genes ( DEGs) related to the abiotic and biotic stress were also addressed. Altogether , 4,985 DEGs were obtained in the autotetraploid against its progenitor diploid , and 66.02 % DEGs is up-regulated. GO analysis shows that these DEGs mainly distributed in ` metabolic process ' , ` cell ' and ` catalytic activity '. KEGG analysis revealed that these DEGs mainly cover ` metabolic pathways ' , ` secondary metabolites ' and ` ribosome '. Moreover , 134 tolerance related DEGs were identified which cover osmotic adjustment substance , protective enzymes/protein , signaling proteins and pathogenesis-related proteins. This study present the differential expression of stress related genes and global gene expression patterns at background level in autotetraploid watermelons. These new evidences could supplement the molecular theoretical basis for the better resistance after the genome doubling in the gourd family.
