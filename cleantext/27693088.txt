  Lung cancer is predominantly a disease of the elderly with about 50 % of diagnoses in patients aged â‰¥ 70 years and about 14 % in those older than 80. Medical and physiological characteristics of elderly cancer patients make the choice of their better treatment more challenging. Furthermore , aging is accompanied by the so called `` immunosenescence '' phenomenon , the age-related decline in the immune system that is one of the potential reasons of increase of the incidence and prevalence of most cancers. There is a growing interest in understanding of immunosenescence and how it may correlate with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in elderly non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) patients. The survival benefit achieved by immunotherapy in all histologies and therapy line settings , added to its manageable toxicity profile , has dramatically changed the scenario of advanced NSCLC treatment. At subgroup analyses of randomized clinical trials , elderly NSCLC population seems to benefit from anti-programmed death-1 ( anti-PD-1)/ anti-programmed death ligand-1 ( anti-PD-L1) agents ' treatment. These efficacy data were also confirmed by studies in real-life setting. The key-points of aging and immunosenescence are described , focusing on the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in elderly NSCLC population.
