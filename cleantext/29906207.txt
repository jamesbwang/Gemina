  The aim was to determine if indices of the autonomic nervous system ( ANS) , derived from the electrodermal activity ( EDA) and electrocardiogram ( ECG) , could be used to detect deterioration in human cognitive performance on healthy participants during 24-hour sleep deprivation. The ANS is highly sensitive to sleep deprivation. Twenty-five participants performed a desktop-computer-based version of the psychomotor vigilance task ( PVT) every 2 hours. Simultaneously with reaction time ( RT) and false starts from PVT , we measured EDA and ECG. We derived heart rate variability ( HRV) measures from ECG recordings to assess dynamics of the ANS. Based on RT values , average reaction time ( avRT) , minor lapses ( RT > 500 ms) , and major lapses ( RT > 1 s) were computed as indices of performance , along with the total number of false starts. Performance measurement results were consistent with the literature. The skin conductance level , the power spectral index , and the high-frequency components of HRV were not significantly correlated to the indices of performance. The nonspecific skin conductance responses , the time-varying index of EDA ( TVSymp) , and normalized low-frequency components of HRV were significantly correlated to indices of performance ( p < 0.05). TVSymp exhibited the highest correlation to avRT ( -0.92) , major lapses ( -0.85) , and minor lapses ( -0.83). We conclude that indices that account for high-frequency dynamics in the EDA , specifically the time-varying approach , constitute a valuable tool for understanding the changes in the autonomic nervous system. This can be used to detect the adverse effects of prolonged wakefulness on human performance.
