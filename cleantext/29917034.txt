  The toxicogenomics field aims to understand and predict toxicity by using ` omics ' data in order to study systems-level responses to compound treatments. In recent years there has been a rapid increase in publicly available toxicological and ` omics ' data , particularly gene expression data , and a corresponding development of methods for its analysis. In this review , we summarize recent progress relating to the analysis of RNA-Seq and microarray data , review relevant databases , and highlight recent applications of toxicogenomics data for understanding and predicting compound toxicity. These include the analysis of differentially expressed genes and their enrichment , signature matching , methods based on interaction networks , and the analysis of co-expression networks. In the future , these state-of-the-art methods will likely be combined with new technologies , such as whole human body models , to produce a comprehensive systems-level understanding of toxicity that reduces the necessity of in vivo toxicity assessment in animal models.
