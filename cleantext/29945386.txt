  Bear<pathogen> Bile Powder contains bile acids , protein , amino acids , bilirubin and microelements and other compounds. Among them , the bile acids are the most active components. Currently , there are many studies on bile acids , but few reports on other components. Therefore , the purpose of this study is to carry out a systematical analysis of multiple components in drainage Bear<pathogen> Bile Powder from different sources. Bilirubin and protein were quantified by microplate spectrophotometer. The contents of bile acids and amino acids were determined by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry ( LC-MS). The contents of microelements were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS) The result indicated that among 20 batches of bear<pathogen> bile powder from different sources there is high similarity ( 0.922-0.977). Tauroursodeoxycholic acid ( TUDCA) and taurochenodeoxycholic acid ( TCDCA) were the two most abundant components. The total contents of them were 41 % -59 % and met the current standard for quality control of bear<pathogen> bile powder. However , significant differences were found in their contents among samples from different sources. Besides , bilirubin , protein , amino acids and microelements also contributed to the differentiation of samples from different sources. The main components of bear<pathogen> bile powder from the different sources were with satisfactory similarity. But bile acids , bilirubin , protein , amino acids and microelements all contributed to the different among samples. Our present study provided a systematical approach for the better quality control and evaluation of bear<pathogen> bile powder.
