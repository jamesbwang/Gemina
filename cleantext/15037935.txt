  BACKGROUND The feasibility of additional dissection of the lateral pelvic lymph nodes ( LPLNs) in patients undergoing total mesorectal excision ( TME) combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC) for locally advanced rectal cancer ( LARC) is controversial. The use of laparoscopic surgery is also debated. In the present study , we evaluated the utility of laparoscopic dissection of LPLNs during TME for patients with LARC and metastatic LPLNs after NAC , based on our experience with 19 cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-five patients with LARC with swollen LPLNs who underwent laparoscopic TME and LPLN dissection were enrolled in this pilot study. The patients were divided into 2 groups: those patients with NAC ( n = 19) and without NAC ( n = 6). Our NAC regimen involved 4 to 6 courses of FOLFOX plus panitumumab , cetuximab , or bevacizumab. RESULTS The operative duration was significantly longer in the NAC group than in the non-NAC group ( 648 vs. 558 minutes , respectively; P = 0.022). The rate of major complications , defined as grade â‰¥ 3 according to the Clavien-Dindo classification , was similar between the 2 groups ( 15.8 % vs. 33.3 % , respectively; P = 0.4016). No conversion to conventional laparotomy occurred in either group. In the NAC group , a histopathological complete response was obtained in 2 patients ( 10.5 %) , and a nearly complete response ( Tis N0 M0) was observed in one patient ( 5.3 %). Although the operation time was prolonged in the NAC group , the other perioperative factors showed no differences between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic LPLN dissection is feasible in patients with LARC and clinically swollen LPLNs , even after NAC.
