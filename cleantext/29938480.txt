  Oxidative stress ( OS) plays a substantial role in inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases , causing cellular damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. OS also contributes to aging and severe neural disorders such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases. Previous registries have documented a reduction in OS levels with Robuvit ® ( Horphag Research , Ltd.) , an extract from wood of the French oak ( Quercus robur) that provides a decrease of OS as well as relief from chronic<symptom> fatigue<symptom> syndrome<symptom> The aim of the present registry was to investigate the influence of Robuvit ® on a group of subjects presenting with mood disorders , oxidative stress , fatigue<symptom> , and insomnia. Forty patients were recruited from a selection of patients with high OS levels as assessed with the d-ROMs test. Twenty-two subjects formed the control group following the standard management plan. The remaining 18 subjects formed the Robuvit ® supplementation group. They received three capsules of Robuvit ® 100 mg per day , for 8 weeks. Tolerability to the supplementation with Robuvit ® was overall good , and no safety concerns were raised. Mood tests showed a significant general improvement in 13 out of 16 items of the BMIS ( P < 0.05) in the active treatment group. Oxidative stress levels decreased significantly with Robuvit ® supplementation after 4 and 8 weeks. Fatigue<symptom> and insomnia score were also significantly better in supplemented subjects ( P < 0.05). No changes were observed in controls. The observed decrease in OS levels in our patients is probably the result of the antioxidative activity of Robuvit ® , and , more precisely , of its active metabolites , the urolithins and ellagic acid.
