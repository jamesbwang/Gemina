  Fibroblast growth factor 18 ( FGF18) increases cell motility and invasion in colon tumors , and is linked with ovarian and lung tumors. Furthermore , the increased expression of FGF18 mRNA and protein has been associated with poor overall survival in cancer patients. However , its function has not been investigated in breast cancer. In the present study , we demonstrated that FGF18 promoted cell growth and metastasis in vitro and stimulated tumor growth in xenograft models in vivo. FGF18 mediated the proliferation of MDA‑MB‑231 cells via the ERK/c Myc signaling pathway and induced epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition ( EMT) factors to promote cancer migration and invasion. The decreased expression of FGF18 was strongly correlated with the loss/reduction of p‑ERK , c‑Myc , N‑cadherin , vimentin and Snail 1 protein in MDA‑MB‑231 cells. Collectively , our results indicated that FGF18 played an important role in the growth and metastasis of breast cancer via the ERK/c Myc signaling pathway and EMT , indicating that FGF18 may be a potential molecular treatment target for breast cancer.
