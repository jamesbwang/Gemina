  We present the results of the prospective follow up of a sample of large head metal-metal total hip arthroplasty obtained after the safety alert regarding a higher incidence of revision of these implants. All patients implanted with the Recap-M2a-Magnum cup between 2008 and 2011 were included. They were prospectively reviewed recording Harris Hip Score , clinical symptoms of chromium or cobalt intoxication. Serum levels of these ions were requested as well as X-Rays and ultrasonography. An MRI was performed in the cases of positive ultrasonography. Twenty-six males with a mean age of 48.54 years ( 32-62 , SD: 7.18) were included. An anterolateral approach and Bi-Metric ( 7) and F-40 ( 19) stems were used. Cephalic diameters ranged 42-52 ( mode: 46) and the mean cup inclination was 39.35 ° ( 21-59 ° , SD: 9.78). During follow-up ( 7.3 years ( 5.9-9.4; SD: .78)) , 3 patients ( 11.5 %) underwent revision ( 2 cases aseptic loosening , 1 pseudotumour). Mean time until revision was 5.4 years ( 3.1-8.0; SD: 2.48). The accumulated survival probability was 88.5 % ( 95 % CI 76.3-100 %). Harris Hip Score was 94.47 ( 66.5-100; SD: 8.94) and the patients showed no metallic intoxication symptoms. The levels of chromium were 1.88 mcg/dl ( 0.6-3.9) and cobalt 1,74 mcg/dl ( 0.5-5,6). One pseudotumour was found in an asymptomatic patient , and small amounts of periarticular liquid were found in 5 patients ( 19.2 %) DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: High revision rates are still found when follow up is extended due to aseptic loosening and pseudotumour formation. MRI might not be the most adequate test to study the complications of these prostheses.
