  The impacts of a model globular protein ( bovine serum albumin , BSA) on aggregation kinetics of graphene oxide ( GO) in aquatic environment were investigated through time-resolved dynamic light scattering at pH 5.5. Aggregation kinetics of GO without BSA as a function of electrolyte concentrations ( NaCl , MgCl
