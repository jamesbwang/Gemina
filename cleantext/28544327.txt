  The prevalence and patterns of food allergy are highly variable in different parts of the world. Differences in food allergy epidemiology may be attributed to a complex interplay of genetic , epigenetic , and environmental factors , suggesting that mechanisms of food allergy may differ in various global populations. Genetic polymorphisms , migration , climate , and infant feeding practices all modulate food allergy risk , and possibly also the efficacy of interventions aimed at primary prevention of food allergy development. Approaches to diagnosis , treatment , and prevention of food allergy should thus be tailored carefully to each population 's unique genetic and environmental make-up. Future research in the context of food allergy prevention should focus on elucidating factors determining differential responses between populations.
