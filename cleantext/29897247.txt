  An approach to synthesize the pentacyclic framework of the polyol diterpenoid ryanodol is reported. The ABC tricycle was constructed by a Co-mediated Pauson-Khand reaction , and both radical and anionic cyclization pathways were developed to form the E-ring. In addition , a reaction sequence involving SeO
