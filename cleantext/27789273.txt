  The core muscles play a central role in stabilizing the head during headers in soccer. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of a fatigued core musculature on the acceleration of the head during jump headers and run headers. Acceleration of the head was measured in a pre-post-design in 68 soccer players ( age: 21.5 ± 3.8 years , height: 180.0 ± 13.9 cm , weight: 76.9 ± 8.1 kg). Data were recorded by means of a telemetric 3D acceleration sensor and with a pendulum header. The treatment encompassed two exercises each for the ventral , lateral , and dorsal muscle chains. The acceleration of the head between pre- and post-test was reduced by 0.3 G (
