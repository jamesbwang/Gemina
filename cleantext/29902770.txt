  We report spectroscopic properties of 3-hydroxyflavone ( 3-HF) and 4 '- N,N-dimethylamino-3-hydroxyflavone ( DMA3HF) in acetonitrile and ethyl acetate at different temperatures in the range from 10 °C to about 67 °C. These compounds are characterized by excited-state intramolecular proton transfer ( ESIPT) which leads to occurrence of two forms of these molecules. For this reason their fluorescence spectra have two bands which correspond to emission of normal and photoproduct ( tautomer) forms. The correlation between ratio of integrated intensity of these two bands and inverse absolute temperature ( the Arrhenius plot) have been applied to estimate energetic properties , such as difference between energy levels of excited states as well ground states for normal and tautomer forms for each molecule.
