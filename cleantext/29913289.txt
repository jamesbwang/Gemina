  The autotrophic removal of sulphate and nitrate in bioelectrochemical reactors was investigated at different external voltages ( 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 and 1.0 V) under anaerobic conditions. Sulphate and nitrate removal , nitrite accumulation , reduction trend of nitrate and sulphate and microbial community structure were explored. Results indicate the highest removal efficiencies of nitrate and sulphate at 43.3 ± 2.8 and 7.1 ± 0.2 mg · l
