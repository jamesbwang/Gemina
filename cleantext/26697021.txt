  Pig diarrhea<disease> causes high mortality and large economic losses in the swine industry. Transmissible gastroenteritis<disease> virus ( TGEV) causes pig diarrhea<disease> , with 100 % mortality in piglets less than 2 weeks old. No investigation has yet been made of the small intestine of piglets that survived infection by TGEV. In this study , we evaluated the impact of TGEV infection on the small intestine of recovered pigs. Histological analyses showed that TGEV infection led to villi atrophy , and reduced villous height and crypt depth. The number of SIgA positive cells , CD3 TGEV infection damages the small intestine , impairs immune functions , and increases pathogenic bacterial loading , all of which may facilitate secondary infections by other pathogens. These findings help quantify the impact of TGEV infection and clarify the pathogenic mechanisms underlying its effects in pigs.
