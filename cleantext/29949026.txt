  To investigate the relationship between onset of delirium<symptom> and time to surgery in hip fracture ( HF) patients with a different degree of cognitive impairment. Retrospective analysis of a prospective database of 939 older adults , aged â‰¥ 75 years admitted with a fragility HF. Subjects underwent a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment on admission , evaluating health status , prefracture functional status in basic and instrumental activities of daily living , and walking ability. According to the Short Portable Mental<symptom> Status<symptom> Questionnaire score , patients were stratified into three categories: cognitively healthy ( 0-2 errors) , mildly to moderately impaired ( 3-7 errors) and severely impaired ( 8-10 errors). Time to surgery ( from admission) was expressed as days. The occurrence of delirium<symptom> was ascertained daily by Confusion Assessment Method. Two hundred ninety-two ( 31.1 %) patients experienced delirium<symptom> during in-hospital stay. They were older , with a higher degree of comorbidity and functional impairment compared to patients without delirium<symptom>. In multivariate analysis , surgical delay resulted a significant independent risk factor for delirium<symptom> ( HR 1.11 , 95 % CI 1.01-1.24) , along with age , prefracture functional disability and cognitive impairment. When the analysis was performed accounting for the cognitive categories , surgical delay demonstrated to increase the risk of delirium<symptom> only in the subcategory of mildly to moderately impaired patients , while no significant effect was demonstrated in patients cognitively healthy or severely impaired. The study supports the concept that older adults with HF should undergo surgery quickly. Patients with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment should be primarily considered as the best target for interventions aiming to reduce time to surgery.
