  Ellagic acid ( EA) is a naturally phenolic acid presented in different foods. It has a variety of biological activities including antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , anti-microbiological and anti-cancer properties. On account of its antioxidant activity , EA might protect cancer cells from free radical damage in photodynamic therapy ( PDT) during which reactive oxygen species ( ROS) production was stimulated leading to irreversible tumor cell injury. In this study , the influence of EA on K562 cells in 5-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA)- based PDT is demonstrated. Cell apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry. Oxidative damage induced by PDT was investigated by measurement of malondialdehyde ( MDA). Comet assay was used to evaluate the potential genotoxic effect induced by PDT on the cells. The results showed that EA supplementation alone did not affect the lipid peroxidation , DNA damage and apoptosis in K562 cells. It increases the lipid peroxidation , DNA damage , apoptosis and decreases the survival rate in K562 cells induced by ALA-PDT. The singlet oxygen quencher sodium azide suppresses apoptosis , lipid peroxidation and DNA damage induced by EA in PDT. In conclusion , EA consumption during PDT did not decrease the effectiveness of cancer therapy on malignant cells. The effect of antioxidants on PDT maybe was determined by its sensitization ability to singlet oxygen.
