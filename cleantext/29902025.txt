  Interventions that focus on the psychiatric and criminogenic needs of justice-involved persons with mental illness are rare. A Treatment Manual for Justice Involved Persons with Mental Illness: Changing Lives and Changing Outcomes ( CLCO) was developed specifically for meeting these co-occurring needs. Although results from an initial evaluation indicated that CLCO successfully resulted in reduced symptomatology and some aspects of criminal risk , much additional work examining the effectiveness of CLCO remains to be done. The present evaluation examined the extent to which offenders gained knowledge ( i.e. , content retention) throughout the program , the extent to which content retention was predictive of program completion , and the extent to which treatment engagement ( i.e. , session attendance and homework completion) was predictive of program completion. Participants consisted of male and female felony offenders in a residential treatment facility ( n = 130) , and dually diagnosed male offenders in a residential treatment facility ( n = 39). Results indicated that participants in this intervention retained treatment content , and this content retention was predictive of treatment completion. Implications of these findings suggest that CLCO is a promising new intervention for justice-involved persons with mental illness. ( PsycINFO Database Record
