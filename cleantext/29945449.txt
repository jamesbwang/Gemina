  Intrachain diffusion of charge carriers in organic conductors is analyzed. Using a tight-binding model Hamiltonian that includes strong electron-phonon coupling combined with a Langevin equation , we simulate both polaron and bipolaron dynamics under quantum-corrected thermal effects. Nonadiabatic molecular time evolution is used to determine how these quasiparticles diffuse through a nondegenerate conjugated polymer. By means of a phenomenological approach , we evaluate the diffusion coefficient and activation energies for the motion of both polarons and bipolarons. The analysis of activation energies , in agreement with available experimental data , suggests that the presence of bipolarons may inhibit the efficiency of organic-based devices. The results presented here point to the importance of taking a closer look at the effects of bipolaron dynamics in organic devices.
