  Chimeric antigen receptor T ( CART) cell therapy has emerged as a potentially curative `` drug '' for cancer treatment. Cryopreservation of CART cells is necessary for their clinical application. Systematic studies on the effects of cryopreservation on the antitumor function of CART cells are lacking. Therefore , we compared the phenotypes and functions of CART cells that were cryopreserved during ex vivo expansion with those of freshly isolated populations. T cells expressing an anti-B-cell-maturation-antigen ( BCMA) chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) were expanded in vitro for 10 days and then cryopreserved. After one month , the cells were resuscitated , and their transduction rates , apoptosis rates and cell subsets were examined via flow cytometry. The results indicated no significant changes in transduction rates or cell subsets , and the survival rate of the resuscitated cells was approximately 90 % Furthermore , similar tumoricidal effects and degranulation functions of the resuscitated cells compared with normally cultured cells were verified by calcein release and CD107a assays. A NOD/SCID mouse model was used to estimate the differences in the in vivo antitumor effects of the cryopreserved and normally cultured T cells , but no significant differences were observed. Following co-culture with several target cell types , the cytokines released by the cryopreserved and normally cultured T cells were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISAs). The results revealed that the release of interleukin-2 ( IL-2) , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) and interferon-γ ( IFN-γ) was significantly decreased. These data demonstrated that with the exception of a decrease in cytokine release , the cryopreserved CART cells retained their antitumor functions.
