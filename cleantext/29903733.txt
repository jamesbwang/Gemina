  Hemorrhagic transformation is a serious complication of ischemic stroke after recanalization therapies. This study aims to identify mechanisms underlying hemorrhagic transformation after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. We used wild-type mice and Selplg The study identifies lymphopenia as a previously unrecognized risk factor for secondary hemorrhagic transformation in mice after severe ischemic stroke. T cells prevent hemorrhagic transformation by their capacity to bind platelets through P-selectin. The results highlight the role of T cells in bridging immunity and hemostasis in ischemic stroke.
