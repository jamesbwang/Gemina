  To examine if the application of Orem 's self-care model could improve self-care knowledge , attitudes , practices , and respiratory conditions of trauma patients with chest tubes , a quasi-experimental study was conducted. The participants were assigned to two groups-namely , Orem 's model and routine care. Although the patients ' self-care knowledge , attitudes , and practices were improved in both groups over the course of 3 days since the initial assessments , there was a greater degree of improvement in the experimental group than that in the control group. However , there were no differences in the improvement of the chest parameters between the two groups. Orem 's model was effective in improving self-care in patients with chest tube.
