  Coronary computed tomographic angiography ( CTA) is a reliable modality to detect coronary artery disease. However , CTA generally overestimates stenosis severity compared with invasive angiography , and angiographic stenosis does not necessarily imply hemodynamic relevance when fractional flow reserve ( FFR) is used as reference. CTA-based FFR ( CT-FFR) , using computational fluid dynamics ( CFD) , improves the correlation with invasive FFR results but is computationally demanding. More recently , a new machine-learning ( ML) CT-FFR algorithm has been developed based on a deep learning model , which can be performed on a regular workstation. In this large multicenter cohort , the diagnostic performance ML-based CT-FFR was compared with CTA and CFD-based CT-FFR for detection of functionally obstructive coronary artery disease. At 5 centers in Europe , Asia , and the United States , 351 patients , including 525 vessels with invasive FFR comparison , were included. ML-based and CFD-based CT-FFR were performed on the CTA data , and diagnostic performance was evaluated using invasive FFR as reference. Correlation between ML-based and CFD-based CT-FFR was excellent ( On-site CT-FFR based on ML improves the performance of CTA by correctly reclassifying hemodynamically nonsignificant stenosis and performs equally well as CFD-based CT-FFR.
