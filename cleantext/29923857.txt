  To study the factors associated with poorer health-related quality of life at 1-year post-allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( alloHCT) , a secondary analysis of a prospective feasibility study was performed. Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory questionnaires were collected in 76 children undergoing alloHCT at baseline ( within 30 d before transplantation) , day 100 , 6 months , and 12 months posttransplantation. The global score improved post-HCT ( baseline: 67.1 , 12 mo: 76.6). Females ( odds ratio , 6.5; 95 % confidence interval , 1.002-42.17; P = 0.04) and patients with low baseline scores ( odds ratio , 7.2; 95 % confidence interval , 1.07-48.63; P = 0.04) had lower scores at 12 months post-HCT and suggest a target group for early interventions such as physical exercise , stress management , and cognitive behavior therapy.
