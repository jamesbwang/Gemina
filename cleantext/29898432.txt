  Betulinic acid ( BA) , a pentacyclic triterpenoid , is a very promising therapeutic drug with varied medicinal properties but it has low water solubility and consequentially low bioavailability. Cyclic β- ( 1 → 3) , ( 1 → 6)- glucans ( CBG) , microbial cyclooligosaccharides produced by Bradyrhizobium<pathogen> japonicum ATCC 10324 having a cavity structure and good solubility in water have been tested for their ability to encapsulate betulinic acid and drug-binding interactions of CBG and BA were studied. First , in silico approach was employed to study the scope of any interaction between the CBG and BA. Then , the cyclic glucan-betulinic acid complexes were prepared in three compositions of 1:1 , 1:2 and 1:3 CBG: BA. The complexes were analysed using UV-VIS spectroscopy , IR spectroscopy , powder XRD , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA) to confirm the computational results and consequently the encapsulation efficiency was found to be 9.53 %.
