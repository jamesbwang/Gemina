  Circulating tumor cells ( CTCs) are a tumor-derived material utilized for liquid-based biopsy; however , capturing rare CTCs for further molecular analysis remains technically challenging , especially in non-small-cell lung cancer. Here , we report the results of a clinical evaluation of On-chip Sort , a disposable microfluidic chip-based cell sorter , for capture and molecular analysis of CTCs from patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Peripheral blood was collected from 30 metastatic lung adenocarcinoma patients to enumerate CTCs using both On-chip Sort and CellSearch in a blind manner. Captured cells by On-chip Sort were subjected to further molecular analysis. Peripheral blood samples were also used for detection of EGFR mutations in plasma using droplet digital PCR. Significantly more CTCs were detected by On-chip Sort ( 22/30; median 5; range , 0-18 cells/5 mL blood) than by CellSearch ( 9/30; median , 0; range , 0-12 cells/7 .5 mL) ( P < 0.01). Thirteen of 30 patients who had a negative CTC count by CellSearch had a positive CTC count by On-chip Sort. EGFR mutations in CTCs captured by On-chip Sort were observed in 40.0 % ( 8/20) of patients with EGFR-mutated primary tumor. EGFR mutations were often observed in 53.3 % ( 8/15) of patients detected in plasma DNA. Expressions of EGFR and vimentin protein on CTCs were also successfully assessed using On-chip Sort. These results suggest that On-chip Sort is an efficient method to detect and capture rare CTCs from patients with lung adenocarcinoma that are undetectable with CellSearch. Mutation detection using isolated CTCs remains to be further tackled ( UMIN000012488).
