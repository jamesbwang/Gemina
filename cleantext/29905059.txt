  To summarize the current progress of laser-assisted cartilage reshaping ( LACR) for prominent ear. The domestic and abroad article concerning the LACR in treatment of prominent ear was reviewed and analyzed. As a new technique , there were three types of LACR therapies that been used for prominent ear. LACR with the 1 064 nm Nd/YAG laser is painful and the penetration depth of the 1 064 nm Nd/YAG laser is greater than that of the 1540 nm Er/Glass laser which is caused more tissue injury. LACR with the 1 540 nm Er/Glass laser has high absorption by the ear cartilage and produce less injury to the surrounding tissue. Use of the CO Application of LACR for prominent ear just has a short period of time , limited number of cases , and few relevant literature reports. Its effectiveness needs to be further studied and clarified.
