  Airway secretions contain a large number of immune-related cells , e.g. , neutrophils , macrophages , and lymphocytes , which can be used as a major resource to evaluate a variety of pulmonary diseases , both for research and clinical purposes. However , due to the heterogeneous and viscous nature of patient mucus , there is currently no reliable dissociation method that does not damage the host immune cells in the patient airway secretion. In this research , we introduce a sample preparation method that uses inertial microfluidics for the patient 's immune assessment. Regardless of the heterogeneous fluidic properties of the clinical samples , the proposed method recovers more than 95 % of neutrophils from airway secretion samples that are diluted 1,000-fold with milliliters of clean saline. By recirculating the concentrated output stream to the initial sample reservoir , a high concentration , recovery , and purity of the immune cells are provided; recirculation is considered a trade-off to the single-run syringe-based operation of inertial microfluidics. The closed-loop operation of spiral microfluidics provides leukocytes without physical or chemical disturbance , as demonstrated by the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA)- induced elastase release of sorted neutrophils.
