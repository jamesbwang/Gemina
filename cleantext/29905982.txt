  A series of alkylated 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyls has been prepared on the gram scale by using an effective Directed ortho Metalation-Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling strategy. These compounds have been used to investigate the substrate specificity of the meta-cleavage dioxygenase BphC , a key enzyme in the microbial catabolism of biphenyl. Isolation and characterization of the meta-cleavage products will allow further study of related processes , including the catabolism of lignin-derived biphenyls.
