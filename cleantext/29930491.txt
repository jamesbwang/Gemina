  The Korean society is rapidly aging and the health care needs for aged people are increasing. In this context , some physicians claim to establish new medical specialty board ( MSB) for geriatric medical experts but also MSB for primary medical care specialists , clinical pharmacologists , and public health experts. In Korea , basic concept for the specialty board system is still under debates and the legal support for the system is poor. At present , doctors with MSBs in private sectors supply 92.4 % of primary medical care but the National Health Care System requires more primary care physicians than specialists in Korea. Therefore , the government must invest in the education of doctors more to improve the public health care system. The proposal of the new MSB for geriatric medicine must be gradually developed according to the national long-term health plan , social needs , and national budget for the public benefit. Please stop discussing unprepared new MSBs.
