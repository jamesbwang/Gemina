  Background/aim: The aim of this study was to determine the specific component of Rosmarinus officinalis ( RO) responsible for increased flap survival and how RO displays its efficacy. Materials and methods: Rectangular random-pattern flaps were elevated from the back of each rat. Group I was the control group. In group II 0.1 mL of cineole , in group III 0.1 mL of alpha-pinene , in group IV 0.1 mL of camphor , in group V 0.1 mL each of alpha-pinene and cineole , in group VI 0.1 mL each of alpha-pinene and camphor , in group VII 0.1 mL each of cineole and camphor , and in group VIII , 0.1 mL each of alpha-pinene , cineole , and camphor was orally administered once a day before surgery. The luminal area of the largest blood vessel in the proximal flap was measured. Interleukin-1 , tumor necrosis<symptom> factor alpha , thiobarbituric acid reactive substances , and vascular endothelial growth factor values were measured. Results: The mean percentage of the viable surface area was significantly greater in groups VIII , III , and V. The mean percentage of vessel diameter was significantly greater in groups V , VIII , and VII. Conclusion: We suggest that alpha-pinene and cineole were the components of RO that were responsible for increased flap survival. The most effective of feature of RO was the antiinflammatory effects.
