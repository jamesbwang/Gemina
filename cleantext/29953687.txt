  Bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP) -2 gene-activated muscle tissue fragments can regenerate large bone defects in preclinical animal models. The use of tissue fragments instead of isolated cells expedites gene-enhanced tissue engineering and may increase the possibility of clinical translation. The present in vitro study investigated whether the osteoinductive effect of BMP-2 on muscle tissue fragments can be enhanced using the heterodimers BMP-2/ 6 or BMP-2/ 7. Skeletal muscle tissue fragments from rats were cultured in vitro for up to 20 days in normal medium , osteogenic medium or osteogenic medium supplemented with either a low ( 50 ng/ml) or high ( 200 ng/ml) concentration of recombinant human BMP-2 , BMP-2/ 6 or BMP-2/ 7. Osteoinduction was evaluated by a quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction , Alizarin red S staining , immunohistology and histomorphometry. Interestingly , BMP-2 was a significantly stronger inducer of osteogenic differentiation within muscle tissue than both heterodimers. Even the low concentration of BMP-2 elicited significantly higher levels of calcium deposition , bone-specific gene expression and protein production than the high concentration of both heterodimers. At the high concentration , BMP-2/ 7 had a significantly stronger osteogenic effect on muscle than BMP-2/ 6. The homodimer BMP-2 induced osteoblastogenesis in muscle faster , at a lower concentration and with a higher potency than the heterodimers BMP-2/ 6 or BMP-2/ 7. The findings of this in vitro study encourage bone repair by muscle implants in combination with BMP-2 single growth factor delivery , which might be beneficial with respect to clinical translation.
