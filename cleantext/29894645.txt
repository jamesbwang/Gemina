  CeO2 nanoparticles ( CNPs) as effective ROS scavengers exhibit potent antioxidant activity. In this study the effect of CNPs investigated was on HO-1 , NQO1 and GCLC expression in the streptozotocin ( STZ) induced diabetic rats. Twenty-four male Wistar rats divided into four groups: Controls did not receive any treatment , diabetic rats received STZ ( 60mg/kg/daily) , CNPs group received CNPs 30mg/kg/daily/ 2 weeks , rats in STZ+CNP s group following STZ injection , received CNPs 30mg/kg/2 weeks. Oxidative stress evaluated by measurement of TAC and TOS levels. HO-1 , NQO1 and GCLC expression measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Following STZ injection , significant lower levels of TAC and higher levels of TOS were observed. CNPs could alleviate deleterious effects of diabetes through the enhancement of TAC levels and a significant decline in TOS levels. HO-1 , NQO1 and GCLC expression in the diabetic rats were lower than controls. HO-1 , NQO1 and GCLC upregulated in the diabetic rates treated with CNPs. There were significant correlations between NQO1 and GCLC , NQO1 and HO-1 and between HO-1 and GCLC expression. Moreover , Nrf2 was associated with NQO1 , GCLC and HO-1 expression. CNPs as Nrf2 up-regulator confers protection against oxidative stress in the testes of STZ-induced diabetic rats by upregulating HO-1 , GCLC and NQO1 cyto-protective genes.
