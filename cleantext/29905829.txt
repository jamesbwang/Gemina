  Luteinizing hormone ( LH) and chorionic gonadotropin ( CG) are glycoproteins fundamental for sexual development and reproduction. Since they act on the same receptor ( LHCGR) , there is a general consensus that LH and hCG are equivalent. However , separate evolution of LHβ and hCGβ subunits occurred in primates , resulting in two molecules sharing ∼ 85 % identity and regulating different physiological events. Pituitary , pulsatile LH production results in a ∼ 90 min half-life molecule targeting the gonads , to regulate gametogenesis and androgen synthesis. Trophoblast hCG , the `` pregnancy hormone '' , exists in several isoforms and glycosylation variants with long half-lives ( hours) , angiogenic potential , and acts on luteinized ovarian cells as a progestational. The different molecular features of LH and hCG lead to hormone-specific LHCGR binding and intracellular signaling cascades. In ovarian cells , LH action is preferentially exerted through kinases , pERK1/2 and pAKT , resulting in irreplaceable proliferative/anti-apoptotic signals and partial agonism on progesterone production in vitro. In contrast , hCG displays notable cAMP/PKA-mediated steroidogenic and pro-apoptotic potential , which is masked by estrogen action in vivo. In vitro data are confirmed by large dataset from assisted reproduction , since the steroidogenic potential of hCG positively impacts on the number of retrieved oocytes , while LH impacts pregnancy rate ( per oocyte number). Interestingly , Leydig cell in vitro exposure to hCG results in qualitatively similar cAMP/PKA and pERK1/2 activation as compared to LH , as well as testosterone. The supposed equivalence of LH and hCG is debunked by such data highlighting their sex-specific functions , thus deeming it an oversight caused by incomplete understanding of clinical data.
