  Microbial nitrogen fixation is crucial for building labile nitrogen stocks and facilitating higher plant colonisation in oligotrophic glacier forefield soils. Here , the diazotrophic bacterial community structure across four Arctic glacier forefields was investigated using metagenomic analysis. In total , 70 soil metagenomes were used for taxonomic interpretation based on 185 nitrogenase ( nif) sequences , extracted from assembled contigs. The low number of recovered genes highlights the need for deeper sequencing in some diverse samples , to uncover the complete microbial populations. A key group of forefield diazotrophs , found throughout the forefields , was identified using a nifH phylogeny , associated with nifH Cluster I and III. Sequences related most closely to groups including Alphaproteobacteria , Betaproteobacteria , Cyanobacteria and Firmicutes. Using multiple nif genes in a Last Common Ancestor analysis revealed a diverse range of diazotrophs across the forefields. Key organisms identified across the forefields included Nostoc , Geobacter , Polaromonas and Frankia. Nitrogen fixers that are symbiotic with plants were also identified , through the presence of root associated diazotrophs , which fix nitrogen in return for reduced carbon. Additional nitrogen fixers identified in forefield soils were metabolically diverse , including fermentative and sulphur cycling bacteria , halophiles and anaerobes.
