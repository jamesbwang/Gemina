  Adverse drug events ( ADEs) , including drug interactions , have a tremendous impact on patient health and generate substantial health care costs. A `` big data '' approach to pharmacovigilance involves the identification of drug-ADE associations by data mining various electronic sources , including: adverse event reports , the medical literature , electronic health records , and social media. This approach has been useful in assisting the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies in monitoring and decision-making regarding drug safety. Data mining can also assist pharmaceutical companies in drug safety surveillance efforts , adhering to risk management plans , and gathering real-world evidence to supplement clinical trial data. The use of data mining for pharmacovigilance purposes provides many unique benefits; however , it also presents many challenges. This paper explores the methods and sources of `` big data '' and how this is contributing to pharmacovigilance efforts.
