  It is reported that glutathione S-transferase mu ( GSTM1) polymorphism is associated with non-viral hepatic cirrhosis ( HC). However , some studies showed different views. Therefore , in this paper , a meta-analysis was conducted to get a more comprehensive understanding of GSTM1 polymorphisms in non-viral HC susceptibility. The results showed that GSTM1 null was associated with the increased risk of non-viral HC ( OR = 1.337 , 95 % CI 1.112-1.804 , p = 0.005). Subgroup analysis of cirrhosis type revealed that GSTM1 null was a prominent risk factor for alcoholic HC ( OR = 1.416 , 95 % CI 1.112-1.804 , p = 0.005). Meanwhile , subgroup analysis of population indicated that the significant differences only existed in Asian population ( OR = 1.719 , 95 % CI 1.212-2.438 , p = 0.002). In hospital-based studies , patients with GSTM1 null were more likely in risk of HC ( OR = 1.426 , 95 % CI 1.092-1.863 , p = 0.009). Subgroup analysis using genotyping method showed a significant association between GSTM1 null genotype and HC occurrence in the studies employing the multiple PCR genotyping method ( OR = 1.559 , 95 % CI 1.171-2.076 , p = 0.002). Based on the results of this analysis , it was concluded that GSTM1 null genotype could increase the susceptibility of non-viral hepatic cirrhosis. In addition , alcohol intake , Asian ethnicity , sample source from hospital and multiple PCR genotyping method may also influence the susceptibility of hepatic cirrhosis.
