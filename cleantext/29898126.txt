  The lawyer Evaristo de Moraes and the physician Nina Rodrigues both investigated the criminal behavior of Marcelino Bispo , the perpetrator of an attack against President Prudente de Moraes on November 5 , 1897 , both highlighting the same issue: criminal responsibility. Speaking out in favor of the precepts of criminal anthropology , they shared the conviction that Bispo 's criminal responsibility should be attenuated in virtue of his suggestible nature. Despite the similarities , could the specific ways they each used the contributions of criminology give us the chance to identify different forms of appropriation of a single intellectual framework? The aim of this study therefore consists of analyzing where the arguments in their respective analyses converged and diverged.
