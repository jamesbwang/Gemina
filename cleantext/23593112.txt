  This study sought to analyze the relationship between the components and aggravations of body composition ( obesity , sarcopenia , and sarcopenic obesity) and bone mineral density in elderly subjects aged â‰¥ 80 years. A cross-sectional study design was utilized to assess 128 subjects aged between 80 and 95 years. Body composition and bone mineral density were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Gait speed was assessment by walking test. The statistical analyses included Spearman 's correlation , one-way analysis of variance , the chi-squared test , and binary logistic regression analysis. The elderly subjects with sarcopenia had lower bone mineral density compared to the obesity group , with higher risk for presence of osteopenia/osteoporosis in the spine ( OR: 2.81; CI: 1.11-7.11) and femur ( OR: 2.75; CI: 1.02-7.44). Obesity was shown to be a protective factor for osteopenia/osteoporosis in the spine ( OR: 0.43; CI: 0.20-0.93) and femur ( OR: 0.27; CI: 0.12-0.62). It was found that lean mass is more directly related to bone mineral density ( total , femur , and spine) and sarcopenia is associated with osteopenia/osteoporosis. Obesity represents a possible protective factor for osteopenia/osteoporosis in elderly subjects aged 80 years and over.
