  Milk yield is a crucial component of a sow operation because it is a limiting factor for piglet growth rate. Stimulating mammary development is one avenue that could be used to improve sow milk<symptom> production<symptom>. A number of studies have shown that nutrition of gilts or sows during the periods of rapid mammary accretion occurring during prepuberty , gestation , and lactation can affect mammary development. The present review provides an overview of all the information currently published on the subject and Table 1 summarizes the dietary treatments that enhance mammary development in pigs. Various nutritional treatments can bring about increases in mammary tissue weight ranging from 27 to 52 %. It was clearly established that feed restriction from 90 d of age ( but not before 90 d) until puberty has detrimental effects on mammary development in pigs. Ad libitum feeding during that period increased mammary parenchymal weight by 36 to 52 %. Body condition is also important because gilts that were obese ( 36 mm backfat) or too lean ( 12 to 15 mm backfat) in late gestation had less developed mammary tissue. Furthermore , overfeeding energy in late gestation seems to be detrimental. On the other hand , increasing energy and protein intakes of sows during lactation was beneficial for development of mammary tissue. Feeding certain plant extracts with estrogenic or hyperprolactinemic properties may also prove beneficial in stimulating mammary development at specific physiological periods. For example , feeding genistein to prepubertal gilts increased parenchymal DNA by 44 %. Even though research was carried out on the nutritional control of mammogenesis in pigs , it is evident that much remains to be learned before the best nutritional strategy to enhance mammary development can be developed.
