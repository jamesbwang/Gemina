  Since NUCB2 was discovered , the information about NUCB2/nesfatin -1 in appetite<symptom> regulation in both mammals and teleost has been still limited. The present study aims to determine the effects of nesfatin-1 on food intake and to explore the appetite<symptom> mechanism in Siberian sturgeon. In this study , nucb2 cDNA sequence of 1571 bp was obtained , and the mRNA expression of nucb2 was abundant in brain and liver. Levels of nucb2 were appreciably increased in brain after feeding 1 and 3 h , while significantly decreased within fasting 15 days. Except for fasting 1 day , the expression pattern of nucb2 in the liver was similar to the brain. Acute intraperitoneal ( i.p.) injection of nesfatin-1 inhibited the food intake during 0-1 h in a dose-dependent manner and 50 or 100 ng/g BW nesfatin-1 significantly decreased the cumulative food intake during 3 h. The daily food intake and cumulative food intake were remarkably reduced post chronic ( 7 days) i.p. injection. Moreover , chronic i.p. injection of nesfatin-1 affected the expression of appetite<symptom> factors including cart , apelin and pyy in the brain , stomach and liver with the consistent pattern of change , while the levels of cck , ucn3 and nucb2 in these have different patterns. This study demonstrates that nesfatin-1 acts as a satiety factor in reducing the short-term and long-term food intake of Siberian sturgeon. Therefore , the data suggesting nesfatin-1 inhibits the appetite<symptom> through different signal pathways in the central and peripheral endocrine systems of Siberian sturgeon.
