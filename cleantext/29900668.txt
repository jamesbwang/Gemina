  Because macrophages are involved in the pathology of many diseases , targeting delivery of therapeutic molecules to macrophages is important issue. Polyrotaxanes ( PRXs) composed of multiple cyclodextrins threaded with a linear polymer were utilized as a therapeutic agent for metabolic disease and for regulating cellular metabolism. For targeting delivery of PRXs to macrophages , carboxyethyl ether group-modified PRXs ( CEE-PRXs) are designed for promoting interaction to macrophage scavenger receptor class A ( SR-A). The cellular internalization of anionic CEE-PRXs in SR-A-positive macrophage-like cells ( RAW264 .7) is remarkably higher than that of nonionic PRX , whereas the cellular internalization efficiency in SR-A-negative cells is comparable between anionic and nonionic PRX. Furthermore , the molecular weight of axle polymer and the number of CEE groups modified on PRX are found to be the predominant factors governing cellular internalization efficiency in SR-A-positive RAW264 .7 cells. Thus , CEE-PRXs are a promising design for targeting delivery of PRXs to macrophages.
