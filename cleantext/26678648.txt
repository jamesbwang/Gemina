  Prompt diagnosis of acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) by the initial ECG is important in order to perform an urgent coronary angiography as soon as possible and achieve successful revascularization , therewith improving mortality and morbidity. Several diseases and conditions can mimic an acute myocardial infarction ( AMI) but may not benefit from a ( percutaneous) revascularization strategy. This narrative clinical review will discuss the ECG features of some of the causes of non-ischemic ST segment elevation to facilitate early recognition , prevent wrongful diagnosis and improve treatment outcomes.
