  MRI of the prostate is widely used in prostate cancer for local staging. The purpose of this article is to show how preoperative prostate MRI findings may be used as a road map for surgery to preserve the neurovascular bundle , identify risk factors associated with positive surgical margins , and evaluate findings associated with intraoperative complications and functional recovery after surgery. Knowledge of surgically relevant imaging findings can increase radiologists ' confidence in reporting them to our colleagues.
