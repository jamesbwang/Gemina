  Mammaglobin , a member of secretoglobin family has been recognized as a breast cancer associated protein. Though the exact function of the protein is not fully known , its expression has been reported to be upregulated in human breast cancer.We focused on studying the expression of mammaglobin-B gene and protein in canine mammary tumor ( CMT) tissue. Expression of mammaglobin-B mRNA and protein were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry ( IHC) , respectively. High levels of mammaglobin-B mRNA expression ( 6.663 Â± 0.841 times) was observed in CMT as compared to age and breed matched healthy controls. Further , expression of mammaglobin-B protein was detected in paraffin-embedded mammary tumor tissues from the same subjects by IHC. Mammaglobin-B protein was overexpressed only in 6.67 % of healthy mammary glands while , a high level of its expression was scored in 76.7 % of the CMT subjects. Moreover , no significant differences in terms of IHC score and qRT-PCR score with respect to CMT histotypes or tumor grades were observed , indicating that mammaglobin-B over-expression occurred irrespective of CMT types or grades. Overall , significantly increased expression of mammaglobin-B protein was found in CMTs with respect to healthy mammary glands , which positively correlates to its transcript. These findings suggest that overexpression of mammaglobin-B is associated with tumors of canine mammary glands.
