  Endometriosis affects about 10 % of women of reproductive age. Its main feature is the presence of stroma and endometrial glands in sites other than the uterus , mainly in pelvis. Pelvic peritoneum , ovaries , uterine ligaments , bladder , intestines , andcul-de-sac are among the affected areas. Sometimes endometriosis can be found outside of the pelvis and even above abdominal cavity , like indiaphragm.Herein , we present a case of an asymptomatic diaphragmatic endometriosis that was discovered incidentally during laparoscopy of pelvic endometriosis , as well as our appropriately proposed treatment protocol.
