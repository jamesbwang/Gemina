  Pediatric gastroenterology is a clinical and research discipline principally developed over the past 50 years. Bibliometric methods provide quantitative analysis and identify research trends. Study aims were to characterize the growth and trends in pediatric gastroenterology clinical and translational research using citation analysis. Using citations analysis software , a search strategy specific for pediatric gastroenterology was implemented for the years 1970-2017. The 50 most-cited research articles per decade were identified. These 250 articles were coded for topic and study attribute. Analysis included authors , affiliations , journals , countries , and funding sources. Overall average annual growth rate for pediatric gastroenterology publications was significantly higher than for general pediatrics ( 51.7 % vs 6.2 %; p < 0.05). Among the top 250 cited articles , the distribution of study focus was epidemiology ( 43 %) , pathophysiology ( 18 %) , treatment ( 16 %) , diagnosis ( 8 %) , prevention ( 8 %) , and comorbidities of gastrointestinal diseases ( 7 %). There were 38 different topics represented and there was a notable shift in topic focus over time. Cholestasis , biliary atresia , and total parenteral nutrition were common topics from 1970-1989 and obesity , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , and eosinophilic esophagitis were common topics after 1990. Notably , 2.3 % of the authors accounted for 30 % of the top 250 articles. Pediatric gastroenterology research has undergone rapid growth yielding advancements in the management of gastrointestinal conditions in children. The emergence of new diseases in need of better diagnostics and therapeutics led to a temporal shift in research focus. Further advancements will require multidisciplinary collaborations and continued funding for pediatric gastroenterology research.
