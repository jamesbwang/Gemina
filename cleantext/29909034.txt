  The aim of this study was to identify the contributions made by size fractions of four milled rice ( i.e. , waxy , white , black and brown rice) to structural and in vitro starch digestion properties after cooking. Rice grains were hammer-milled in a controlled manner , and the coarse ( 300-450 μm) , medium ( 150-300 μm) and fine size ( < 150 μm) fractions were segregated through vertical sieving. All samples displayed monophasic digestograms , and starch digestion rate and extent for size fractionated rice flours were predicted through the Logarithm of Slope model. It was found that digestion rate and extent were markedly reduced with increasing particle size within each rice variety. Of the four rice varieties , non-waxy rice flour fractions showed lower digestion rate and extent compared to the waxy counterpart , possibly due to the formation starch-lipid complexes as judged by XRD with ca. 4 % -8 % V-type crystalline structure remained after cooking. We suggested that the less rigid morphological structure and almost amorphous conformation lead to the high digestion rate and extent during simulated intestinal starch digestion. These findings will help develop functional rice ingredients with desirable digestion behaviour and attenuated postprandial glycemic responses.
