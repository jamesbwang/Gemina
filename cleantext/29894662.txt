  Hospital readmissions after surgery are a focus of quality improvement efforts. Although some reflect appropriate care , others are potentially preventable readmissions ( PPRs). We aim to describe the burden , timing , and factors associated with readmissions after complex cancer surgery. The Nationwide Readmissions Database ( 2013) was used to select patients undergoing a complex oncologic resection , which was defined as esophagectomy/gastrectomy , hepatectomy , pancreatectomy , colorectal resection , lung resection , or cystectomy. Readmissions within 30 days from discharge were analyzed. International Classification of Diseases ( 9th revision) primary diagnosis codes were reviewed to identify PPRs. Multivariable logistic regression analyses identified demographic , clinical , and hospital factors associated with readmissions. Of the 59,493 eligible patients , 14 % experienced a 30-day readmission , and 82 % of these were deemed PPRs. Half of the readmissions occurred within the first 8 days of discharge. Infections ( 26 %) , GI complications ( 17 %) , and respiratory conditions ( 10 %) accounted for most readmissions. Factors independently associated with an increased likelihood of readmission included Medicaid versus private insurance ( odds ratio ( OR) , 1.32; 95 % CI , 1.17 to 1.48) , higher comorbidity score ( OR , 1.5; 95 % CI , 1.33 to 1.63) , discharge to a facility ( OR , 1.39; 95 % CI , 1.29 to 1.51) , prolonged length of stay ( OR , 1.42; 95 % CI , 1.32 to 1.52) , and occurrence of a major in-hospital complication ( OR , 1.24; 95 % CI , 1.16 to 1.34). One in seven patients undergoing complex cancer surgery suffered a readmission within 30 days. We identified common causes of these and identified patients at high risk for such an event. These data can be used by physicians , administrators , and policymakers to develop strategies to decrease readmissions.
