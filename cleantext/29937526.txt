  Cardiovascular malformations are one of the most common birth defects among newborns and constitute a leading cause of perinatal and infant mortality. Although some risk factors are recognized , the causes of cardiovascular malformations ( CVMs) remain largely unknown. In this study , we aim to identify risk factors for ventricular septal defects ( VSDs) in Northwest Russia. The study population included singleton births registered in the Murmansk County Birth Registry ( MCBR) between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2011. Infants with a diagnosis of VSD in the MCBR and/or in the Murmansk Regional Congenital Defects Registry ( up to two years post-delivery) constituted the study sample. Among the 52,253 infants born during the study period there were 744 cases of septal heart defects ( SHDs) , which corresponds to a prevalence of 14.2 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) of 13.2 ⁻ 15.3) per 1000 infants. Logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify VSD risk factors. Increased risk of VSDs was observed among infants born to mothers who abused alcohol ( OR = 4.83; 95 % CI 1.88 ⁻ 12.41) , or smoked during pregnancy ( OR = 1.35; 95 % CI 1.02 ⁻ 1.80). Maternal diabetes mellitus was also a significant risk factor ( OR = 8.72; 95 % CI 3.16 ⁻ 24.07) , while maternal age , body mass index , folic acid and multivitamin intake were not associated with increased risk. Overall risks of VSDs for male babies were lower ( OR = 0.67; 95 % CI 0.52 ⁻ 0.88).
