  FoxM1 plays important regulatory roles in a variety of diseases. However , the functional role of FoxM1 and mechanisms responsible for its expression in gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST) is not thoroughly understood. FoxM1 protein expression and biological function were examined in human GIST tissues and cells using immunohistochemistry , quantitative real-time PCR , western blot , CCK-8 , wound-healing- and Matrigel invasion assays , respectively. The role of hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF) signaling in FoxM1 expression was investigated using chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter and in vivo tumor growth assays. FoxM1 was highly expressed in highly proliferative and migratory/invasive GIST specimens. Upregulation of FoxM1 was positively correlated with the expression of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in GIST specimens , and hypoxia-induced FoxM1 expression in GIST cells. Functionally , ectopic expression of FoxM1 significantly promoted GIST cell proliferation , cell cycle progression , migration and invasion , whereas the knockdown of endogenous FoxM1 of hypoxic GIST cells had the opposite effects. Molecularly , FoxM1 was transcriptionally regulated by HIF-2α under normoxia , whereas it was upregulated by both HIF-1α and HIF-2α under hypoxia. The xenograft tumor data further confirmed the regulated effect of HIF-1α and HIF-2α on FoxM1 , and demonstrated that the simultaneous downregulation of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α inhibited GIST tumor growth. Our data demonstrated the critical role of FoxM1 in promoting GIST progression and uncovered a novel HIF-1α/ HIF-2α-FoxM1 axis. These findings identify FoxM1 as a possible new molecular target for designing novel therapeutic treatments to control GIST progression.
