  To study the presence of Bartonella<pathogen> bacilliformis<pathogen> in ticks collected from two wild mammals in Madre de Dios , Peru. A total of 110 ticks were collected. Among the 43 Amblyomma<pathogen> spp. extracted from the 3 Tapirus terrestris<pathogen> only 3 were positive for B.<pathogen> bacilliformis<pathogen>. In addition , 12 out of the 67 Rhipicephalus ( Boophilus) microplus obtained from the 3 Pecari tajacu were positive for B.<pathogen> bacilliformis<pathogen>. For the first time B.<pathogen> bacilliformis<pathogen> have been detected in arthropods other than Lutzomyia spp.. Further studies are required to elucidate the possible role of ticks in the spread of South American Bartonellosis.
