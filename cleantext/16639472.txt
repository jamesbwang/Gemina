  Atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is associated with significant morbidity and increased mortality. As body mass index ( BMI) is increasingly recognized as an important risk factor for the development of AF , we tested the hypothesis that BMI modulates symptomatic AF burden. Cross-sectional data collected from 1,382 patients in the Vanderbilt AF Registry were analyzed. AF severity was assessed using the Toronto atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> severity scale ( AFSS). BMI was categorized according to World Health Organization guidelines and patients were grouped according to their present AF treatment regimen: no treatment ( n = 185) , rate control therapy with atrioventricular nodal blocking agents ( n = 351) , rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs ( n = 636) , and previous AF ablation ( n = 210). Patients with BMI > 35 kg/m
