  1-Deoxynojirimycin ( DNJ) is a potent Î±-glucosidase inhibitor and thus beneficial for prevention of diabetes. While we have succeeded in obtaining the culture supernatant extract ( CSE) rich in DNJ from microorganism source , information regarding its anti-hyperglycemic effect and safety were still limited. Therefore , this study was aimed to evaluate the anti-hyperglycemic effect and safety of microorganism DNJ. Oral sucrose tolerance test was performed , and the result showed that CSE was able to significantly suppress the blood glucose elevation and suggested DNJ as the main active compound. To determine its safety , the absorption and excretion of microorganism DNJ were evaluated using 15N labeling method. Our findings investigated the recovery rate of 15N from DNJ reached 80 % up to 48 hours after oral administration , suggesting its rapid excretion , suggesting the safety of DNJ. This study verified the functional properties and safety of DNJ from microorganisms , suggesting its potential use for functional purpose.
