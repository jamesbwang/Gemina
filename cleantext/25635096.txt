  The mental representation of both time and number shows lateral spatial biases , which can be affected by habitual reading and writing direction. However , this effect is in place before children begin to read. One potential early cause is the experiences of looking at picture books together with a carer , as those images also follow the directionality of the script. What is the underlying mechanism for this effect? In the present study , we test the possibility that such experiences induce spatial biases in mental model construction , a mechanism which is a good candidate to induce the biases observed with numbers and times. We presented a speechless comic in either standard ( left-to-right) or mirror-reversed ( right-to-left) form to adult Spanish participants. We then asked them to draw the scene depicted by sentences like ` the square is between the cross and the circle '. The position of the lateral objects in these drawings reveals the spatial biases at work when building mental models in working memory. Under conditions of highly consistent directionality , the mirror comic changed pre-existing lateral biases. Processes of mental model construction in working memory stand as a potential mechanism for the generation of spatial biases for time and number.This article is part of the theme issue ` Varieties of abstract concepts: development , use and representation in the brain '.
