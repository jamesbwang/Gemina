  The major steps in vaginoplasty are orchiectomy , penile amputation , creation of the neovaginal cavity with lining , and reconstruction of urethral meatus , labia , and clitoris. During pedicled intestinal transfer , an intestinal segment is transferred in a dissected cavity between the bladder and rectum. The bowel harvest is performed by a total laparoscopic technique. It is imperative to create the labia majora and minora , the clitoris , and a clitoral hood to achieve the physiologic and aesthetic equivalent of female external genitalia. Intestinal vaginoplasty seems to be associated with a low rate of adverse events. Life-long vaginal hygiene and dilatation is recommended.
