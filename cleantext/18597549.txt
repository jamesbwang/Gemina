  To examine whether young peoples ' risk of cannabis , mephedrone and novel psychoactive substances ( NPS) use is associated with school substance-misuse policy. A cross-sectional survey of secondary school students combined with a School Environment Questionnaire and independently coded school substance-misuse policies ( 2015/6). 66 secondary schools in Wales. Students aged 11-16 years ( n = 18939). The prevalence of lifetime , past 30-day and daily cannabis use was 4.8 % , 2.6 % and 0.7 % , respectively; lifetime prevalence of mephedrone use was 1.1 % and NPS use was 1.5 %. Across 66 schools , 95.5 % ( n = 63) reported having a substance-misuse policy , 93.9 % ( n = 62) reported having a referral pathway for drug using students , such that we were insufficiently powered to undertake an analysis. We found little evidence of a beneficial association between lifetime cannabis use and involving students in policy development including student council consultation ( OR = 1.24 , 95 % CI 0.89 to 1.73) , other student consultation ( OR = 1.42 , 95 % CI 0.94 to 2.14) or with the use of isolation ( OR = 0.98 , 95 % CI 0.67 to 1.43) , with similar results for cannabis use in past 30 days , daily and the lifetime use of mephedrone and NPS. The School Environment Questionnaires found that 39.4 % ( n = 26) schools reported no student involvement in policy development , 42.4 % ( n = 28) reported student council consultation , 18.2 % ( n = 12) used other student consultations and 9.7 % ( n = 3) mentioned isolation. The independently coded content of policies found that no school policy recommended abstinence , one mentioned methods on harm minimisation , 16.1 % ( n = 5) policies mentioned student involvement and 9.7 % ( n = 3) mentioned isolation. Policy development involving students is widely recommended , but we found no beneficial associations between student involvement in policy development and student drug use. This paper has highlighted the need for further contextual understanding around the policy-development process and how schools manage drug misuse.
