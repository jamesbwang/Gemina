  Consumers generally considered organic products to be healthier and safer but data regarding the contamination of organic products are scarce. This study evaluated the impact of the farming system on the levels of ochratoxin A ( OTA) in the tissues of French pigs ( muscle and liver) reared following three different types of production ( organic , Label Rouge and conventional). Because OTA is present at trace levels in animal products , a sensitive ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method using stable isotope dilution assay was developed and validated. OTA was detected or quantified ( LOQ of 0.10 Î¼g kg
