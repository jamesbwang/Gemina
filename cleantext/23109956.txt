  The aim of this study was to conduct a sero-epidemiological survey in Alborz Province , central Iran to detect the rate of hydatidosis in the city and nearby villages. Overall , 680 serum samples were collected from 536 male and 127 female subjects referred to different health centers of Karaj , Alborz Province , central Iran and nearby villages in 2014-15. All patients filled out a questionnaire and an informed consent. Sera were analyzed using indirect-ELISA test with AgB. Ten Î¼g/ml antigens ( Proceeded hydatid fluid) , serum dilutions of 1:500 and conjugate anti-human coombs with 1:10000 dilutions were utilized to perform the test. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS software ver. 11.5. Twenty-three cases ( 3.4 %) were positive for hydatidosis by ELISA test. The prevalence of hydatidosis among females and males was 3.1 % and 4.7 % , respectively. The rate of the disease was significantly higher in areas where dogs were higher ( Because of the specific situation of Alborz Province , and availability of many stray dogs , obtained rate of hydatidosis shows that the authorities should be cautious to monitor the disease.
