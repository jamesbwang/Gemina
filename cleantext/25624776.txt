  In this study , we evaluated whether platelet-rich plasma ( PRP) is superior to hyaluronic acid ( HA) in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , PubMed , and Embase databases were searched for English-language , human in vivo studies on the treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis with intra-articular PRP compared with HA. The following keywords were used for the search: `` platelet-rich plasma , '' `` PRP , '' `` platelet-rich fibrin , '' `` PRF , '' `` platelet , '' `` plasma , '' `` arthritis<disease> , '' `` osteoarthritis , '' `` gonarthrosis , '' and `` degeneration. '' Seven articles reporting 908 patients and 908 knees were analyzed , including 44 % men and 56 % women with a mean age of 59.8 years. All studies met the minimal clinically important difference criteria and showed statistically significant improvements in clinical outcomes , including pain , physical function , and stiffness , with PRP treatment. All except two studies showed significant differences between PRP and HA regarding clinical outcomes of pain and function. PRP intra-articular injection of the knee may be an effective alternative treatment for knee OA , especially in patients with mild knee OA. Although some studies suggested that the effect of PRP was no better than HA , we found that it was no worse. A large , multicenter , randomized trial is needed to further assess the efficacy of PRP treatment for patients with knee OA. PROSPERO , CRD42016048394. Registered on October 2 , 2016).
