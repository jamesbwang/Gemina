  Both gains and losses of DNA methylation are common in cancer , but the factors controlling this balance<symptom> of methylation remain unclear. Triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC) , a subtype that does not overexpress hormone receptors or HER2/NEU , is one of the most hypomethylated cancers observed. Here we discovered that the TET1 DNA demethylase is specifically overexpressed in about 40 % of patients with TNBC , where it is associated with hypomethylation of up to 10 % of queried CpG sites and a worse overall survival. Through bioinformatic analyses in both breast and ovarian cancer cell line panels , we uncovered an intricate network connecting TET1 to hypomethylation and activation of cancer-specific oncogenic pathways including PI3K , EGFR , and PDGF. TET1 expression correlated with sensitivity to drugs targeting the PI3K-mTOR pathway , and CRISPR-mediated deletion of TET1 in two independent TNBC cell lines resulted in reduced expression of PI3K pathway genes , upregulation of immune response genes , and substantially reduced cellular proliferation , suggesting dependence of oncogenic pathways on TET1 overexpression. Our work establishes TET1 as a potential oncogene that contributes to aberrant hypomethylation in cancer and suggests that TET1 could serve as a druggable target for therapeutic intervention.
