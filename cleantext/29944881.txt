  Postoperative complications result in significantly increased healthcare expenditures. Our objective was to examine 90-day excess costs associated with inpatient complications post-esophagectomy , and their predictive factors , utilizing the Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results ( SEER)- Medicare database. We examined patients over age 65 diagnosed from 2002-2009 undergoing esophagectomy for cancer in SEER-Medicare database. Quantile regression models were fit at 5 % intervals for excess 90-day cost associated with perioperative complications , controlling for baseline characteristics. Excess cost was defined as the difference in total cost for patients with versus without the complication. Analyses were stratified by patient characteristics to identify factors predictive of excess cost. 1,462 patients were identified in the cohort , 51 % had at least one complication. Significant excess cost was associated with pulmonary and mechanical wound<disease> complication across all quantiles ( p < 0.05). Infectious ( 0.35-0.75 quantiles) , intraoperative ( 0.05-0.85 quantiles) , and systemic ( 0.30-0.85 quantiles) complications were associated with higher costs. Further , excess costs were significantly elevated in the higher quantiles. At the 0.50 quantile ( median) of total cost distribution , excess cost in patients with any complication were significantly higher in patients with the following characteristics: transthoracic esophagectomy , emergent esophagectomy , Charlson comorbidity index > 0 , living in a non-metropolitan area or poorer community , or treated in larger hospitals; no such difference was identified in patients without complications. Complications after esophagectomy result in significant excess 90-day cost. Efforts at cost reduction and quality improvement will need to focus on reducing complications , in particular pulmonary and infectious , as well as risk factors for higher complication costs.
