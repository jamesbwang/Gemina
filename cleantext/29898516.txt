  Normalisation is an optional step in Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA) , often used in decision making since it helps interpreting the results of LCA studies with regard to some reference information. The applicable ISO standard recommends considering different reference systems to guarantee the robustness of the normalisation step , and so the availability of different normalisation datasets becomes of high relevance. Life Cycle Impact Assessment ( LCIA) methods provide normalisation factors ( NFs) for global and regional areas , but no NFs are proposed for smaller areas such as local or subnational scales. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of using territorial LCA approach to determine subnational NFs. Normalisation datasets for both Galician ( NW Spain) production and consumption activities have been calculated considering a life cycle perspective. In addition to this , the normalisation datasets calculated for Galicia have been used to evaluate two food products produced and/or consumed in the region as case studies. Then , the normalised results have been compared to those obtained using different reference systems ( Europe and the World) , calculated following the same methodology ( ReCiPe). A qualitative uncertainty analysis of the NFs has been carried out , and the usefulness of territorial LCA to determine them has been discussed. It was concluded that territorial LCA is a promising way to determine NFs but that some improvements could be made , which have also been pointed out here.
