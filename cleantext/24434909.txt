  We undertook a feasibility study to reassess metabolic outcomes in young people with early onset obesity who attended a hospital-based lifestyle weight-loss intervention during adolescence. Comparisons of metabolic assessments , including body mass index standard deviation scores ( BMI ⁻ SDSs) , blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) , oral glucose tolerance tests ( OGTTs) , lipid profile , and alanine transaminase ( ALT) , before and after treatment were made. Twenty-five subjects ( 10 males) with median ages ( interquartile range , IQR) of 14.5 ( 12.6 ⁻ 15.4) years at the beginning of intervention and 18.2 ( 17.2 ⁻ 18.9) years at reassessment and who were 3.5 ( 2.4 ⁻ 6.5) years post-intervention were recruited. Twenty-eight percent had a & ge; 0.25 reduction in BMI ⁻ SDS from baseline ( responders). Responders demonstrated significantly lower BMI ⁻ SDS , systolic BP , and glucose disposal at reassessment compared with baseline. They also showed significantly lower total fat percentage SDSs , trunk fat percentages , 120 min insulin , and ALT , as well as higher insulin sensitivity index ( ISI
