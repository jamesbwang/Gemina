  Environmental factors may interact with genetic factors via the epigenetic process , and this interaction can contribute to inter-individual variability in the treatment response. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction effects between dopamine receptor D4 ( DRD4) methylation and prenatal maternal stress on the methylphenidate ( MPH) response of youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD). This study was an 8-week open-label trial of MPH that included 74 ADHD youth. We investigated the associations between MPH treatment response , which was defined as a score â‰¤ 2 on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement ( CGI-I) scale , and the methylation of 28 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide ( CpG) sites of DRD4. Additionally , the interaction effects between DRD4 methylation and prenatal maternal stress on changes in Continuous Performance Test ( CPT) scores after MPH treatment were investigated. Although there were no significant sites that showed significant association with treatment response , there was a significant interaction effect of the methylation of CpG7 and prenatal maternal stress on changes in omission errors of the CPT following treatment ( p = 0.0001). The present findings indicate that the interaction between methylation of CpG7 of DRD4 and prenatal maternal stress may be predictive of the treatment response to MPH in youth with ADHD.
