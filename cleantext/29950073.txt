  The quality standard of Chinese herbal medicine is the key in quality control , and the establishment of rice processing technology standard of rice fried Codonopsis Radix has important significance for the overall quality control. In this study , the color brightness ( L *) , red-green chromaticity coordinate ( a *) , yellow-blue chromaticity coordinate ( b *) and total color value （ E * ab ） were determined by colorimeter and used as the shape indexes. Ethanol extractives , polysaccharide , lobetyolin and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural contents were determined by using high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC) and ultraviolet ( UV) , and used as chemical indexes in the analysis by normalization distance method. The two index methods were adopted to optimize the processing technology of rice fried Codonopsis Radix by taking processing temperature , processing time , rice types and rice dosage as factors. The correlation analysis between the two index methods was carried out by SAS 9.40 and JMP 11 software. The results showed that all the four factors had significant differences , and the best processing technology was as follows: polished round-grained rice as raw material , processing temperature at 140 °C , processing time of 10 min , and the ratio of Codonopsis pilosula and rice is 100:30. Chemical indexes showed significant positive correlations with shape indexes , providing basis for the quality evaluation of rice fried Codonopsis Radix in processing.
