  MicroRNAs ( miRs) are 18 ~ 23 nucleotides long non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. To explore whether miR alterations in tauopathy contribute to pathological conditions , we first determined which hippocampal miRs are altered at the presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of tauopathy using rTg4510 mice ( Tau mice) , a well-characterized tauopathy model. miR-RNA pairing analysis using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( IPA) revealed 401 genes that can be regulated by 71 miRs altered in Tau hippocampi at the presymptomatic stage. Among several miRs confirmed with real-time qPCR , miR142 ( -3 p and -5 p) in Tau hippocampi were significantly upregulated by two-weeks of age and onward. Transcriptome studies by RNAseq and IPA revealed several overlapping biological and disease associated pathways affected by either Tau or miR142 overexpression , including Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( Stat3) and Tumor Necrosis<symptom> Factor Receptor 2 ( Tnfr2) signaling pathways. Similar to what was observed in Tau brains , overexpressing miR142 in wildtype cortical neurons augments mRNA levels of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein ( Gfap) and Colony Stimulating Factor 1 ( Csf1) , accompanied by a significant increase in microglia and reactive astrocyte numbers. Taken together , our study suggests that miR alterations by Tau overexpression may contribute to the neuroinflammation observed in Tau brains.
