  Solution-processed electroluminescent tandem white quantum-dot light-emitting diodes ( TWQLEDs) have the advantages of being low-cost and high-efficiency and having a wide color gamut combined with color filters , making this a promising backlight technology for high-resolution displays. However , TWQLEDs are rarely reported due to the challenge of designing device structures and the deterioration of film morphology with component layers that can be deposited from solutions. Here , we report an interconnecting layer with the optical , electrical , and mechanical properties required for fully solution-processed TWQLED. The optimized TWQLEDs exhibit a state-of-the-art current efficiency as high as 60.4 cd/A and an extremely high external quantum efficiency of 27.3 % at a luminance of 100000 cd/m
