  There is limited knowledge of the effects of time on change in pelvic floor muscle strength after childbirth. The objectives of this study were to estimate the change in pelvic floor muscle strength in parous women over time and to identify maternal and obstetric characteristics associated with the rate of change. This is an IRB approved prospective cohort study of parous women. Participants were recruited 5-10 years after first delivery and followed annually. Pelvic floor muscle strength ( peak pressure with voluntary contraction) was measured at two annual visits approximately 4 years apart , using the Peritron 543 participants completed two perineometer measurements with a median 4 years between measures ( IQR , 3.1 , 4.8). At initial measurement , women were , on average , 40 years old and 8 years from first delivery. Initial strength was higher in participants who delivered all their children by cesarean ( 38.5 cmH Among parous women , pelvic muscle strength increased minimally over time with an average change of 1.2 cm H
