  A growing number of infertile women undergo assisted reproductive technology ( ART). Older maternal age and the presence of comorbidities may affect cardiovascular ( CV) women health. Safety aspects are central in risk assessment; we report the experience of internal medicine clinical setting at the ART center. we investigated 243 infertile women ( 110 autologous and 133 oocyte donation ( OD)); cardiometabolic parameters and CV risk factors were investigated during the clinical evaluation. We observed high prevalence of dyslipidemia ( 62.9 %) , smoking habit ( 27.5 %) , and body mass index ( 26.7 %). Waist â‰¥ 80 cm was present in 65 % , and waist to hip ratio ( WHR) value > 0.80 in 60.5 % of women. The prevalence of migraine with aura , hypertension , and diabetes was 5.3 % , 4.9 % , and 4.5 % , respectively. By evaluating variables according to autologous or OD ART , we observed that OD women were older than autologous , p < 0.0001. Overweight and obesity prevalence was higher in OD group; waist and WHR were significantly higher in autologous than in OD group ( 75 % vs. 57 % , p = 0.005 , and 91.8 % vs. 34.6 % , p = 0.01 , respectively). We observed a statistically significant unfavorable risk profile in OD in comparison to autologous women ( p = 0.003); in particular , 60 % of OD women carried 3-5 CV risk factors , and 8.3 % carried at least six CV risk factors. The experience of an internal medicine clinic at the ART center strongly underlies the relevance of a careful medical evaluation before attempting ART , and suggests the opportuneness of a structured internal medicine clinic in every gynecology setting to better frame risk profile.
