  One of the greatest challenges in systemic treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC) is a small tumor cell population , namely , cancer stem-like cells ( CSC). CSC can regenerate and maintain a heterogenic tumor by their self-renewal capacity. Their potential ability to be more resistant to and survival after chemo- and radiation therapy was also identified. Further studies have shown that reactive oxygen species ( ROS) contribute to this CSC-associated resistance. In this review , we focus on the current knowledge of HNSCC-CSC , with regard to ROS as a possible and novel therapeutic approach in targeting CSC.
