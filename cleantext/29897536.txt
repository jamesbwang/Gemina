  New DML TL cards with GR-200A detectors were developed. The TL sensitivity remains stable and the detectors were sealed firmly during the encapsulation process. The sensitivity , detection threshold , residual signal , reusability , dose response and Teflon capsule resistance of DML cards with two GR-200A detectors with diameter 3.6 mm and thickness 0.38 mm placed in positions 2 and 3 were evaluated. The detection thresholds were 0.61 μSv for the detector at position 2 and 1.15 μSv for the detector at position 3. The residual signals were 0.40 % for the detector at position 2 and 0.57 % for the detector at position 3. The 10 repeated readings of the same 10 irradiated cards were found within 1 % for the two detectors on the cards. The DML cards demonstrate very high sensitivity , low background and good stability and can be used for very low dose ranges in personnel dosimetry and in environmental monitoring.
