  Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries all over the world. The only drug for ischemic stroke approved by FDA is recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rtPA). However , only 2-5 % stroke patients receive rtPAs treatment due to its strict therapeutic time window. As ischemic stroke is a complex<disease> disease<disease> involving in multiple mechanisms , medications with multi-targets may be more powerful compared with single-target drugs. Dl-3-n-Butylphthalide ( NBP) is a synthetic compound based on l-3-n-Butylphthalide that is isolated from seeds of Apium graveolens. The racemic 3-n-butylphthalide ( dl-NBP) was approved by Food and Drug Administration of China for treatment of ischemic stroke in 2002. A number of clinical studies indicated that NBP not only improved the symptoms of ischemic stroke , but also contributed to the long-term recovery. The potential mechanisms of NBP for ischemic stroke treatment may target different pathophysiological processes , including anti-oxidant , anti-inflammation , anti-apoptosis , anti-thrombosis , and protection of mitochondria et al.. In this review , we have summarized the research progress of NBP for the treatment of ischemic stroke during the past two decades.
