  The clinical efficacy of clopidogrel in secondary prevention of vascular events is hampered by marked inter-patient variability in drug response , which partially depends on genetic make-up. The aim of this pilot prospective study was to evaluate 12-month cardiovascular outcomes in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome<disease> ( ACS) receiving dual antiplatelet therapy ( aspirin and clopidogrel) according to the clustering of CYP2C19 and ABCB1 genetic variants. Participants were 100 consecutive ACS patients who were genotyped for CYP2C19 ( G681A and C-806T) and ABCB1 ( C3435T) polymorphisms , which affect clopidogrel metabolism and bioavailability , using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. They were then grouped as poor , extensive and ultra-rapid metabolisers based on the combination of CYP2C19 loss-of-function ( CYP2C19 * 2) and gain-of-function ( CYP2C19 * 17) alleles and ABCB1 alleles. The predictive value of each phenotype for acute vascular events was estimated based on 12-month cardiovascular outcomes. The poor metabolisers were at an increased risk of thrombotic events ( OR 1.26; 95 % CI 1.099-1.45; Ï‡ Our findings suggest that ACS patients classified as ` poor or ultra-rapid ' metabolisers based on CYP2C19 and ABCB1 genotypes should receive alternative antiplatelet therapies to clopidogrel.
