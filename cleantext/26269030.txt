  Assessing consciousness<symptom> in traumatic brain injury is important because it also determines the treatment option , which will influence patients ' outcome. A tool used to objectively assess consciousness<symptom> level is the bispectral index ( BIS) monitor , which was originally designed to monitor the depth of anesthesia. Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended ( GOS-E) provides a measuring tool to assess traumatic brain injury ( TBI) outcome. The goal of this study was to assess the correlation between GOS-E scores with BIS values in patients with TBI who underwent craniotomy. A total of 68 patients admitted to the emergency department with decreased consciousness<symptom> due to TBI who underwent craniotomy were included in the study. BIS value was measured upon admission , then GOS-E score was determined 6 months after the incident took place. Spearman 's correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between GOS-E score and BIS value. In 68 patients , the GOS-E score was found to have a strong correlation ( This study found that there is a strong correlation between GOS-E score and BIS value. These findings suggest that BIS scores upon admission may be used to predict the outcomes in patients with TBI. However , the wide distribution of BIS values for each GOS-E score may limit the use of BIS scores in accurately predicting GOS-E scores.
