  We established a young ( Y)- old ( O) rat kidney transplantation model. With this model , we detected no age-related differences in renal structure between Y → Y and Y → O kidneys or O → O and O → Y kidneys. However , we did detect differences in levels of the senescence markers β-gal and p16 as well as the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β. Using proteomics analysis we detected 66 proteins associated with suppression of aging and 73 proteins associated with enhancement of aging. After construction of a protein-protein interaction network , a total of 73 nodes and 99 edges were analyzed using MCODE , and three significant modules were selected. GO and KEGG analyses showed that these proteins were mainly located in mitochondria and were largely related to oxidative stress. Among them , SOD1 expression was lower in Y → O than Y → Y kidneys and higher in O → Y than O → O kidneys. Acetylated ( Ac)- NF-κB showed the opposite expression profile. In addition , SOD1 expression was higher in primary tubular epithelial cells from young rats than old rats , and SOD1 knockdown led to increased Ac-NF-κB expression. These findings suggest the local renal environment , particularly oxidative stress/mitochondrial function , affects renal aging.
