  In this study we elucidate antioxidative properties of the mushroom Ganoderma applanatum ( Pers.) Pat. enhanced by submerged culture with para-hydroxyphenolic compounds and tea leaf extracts. The tea extract has been shown to increase to different extents the antioxidative efficiency of para-substituted phenolics , with the most profound effect for 2- ( 4-hydroxyphenyl) ethane-1-ol ( tyrosol). Within the range of physiological concentrations , the symbatic correlation of the antioxidative action of the fungal samples with the volume of tea extract in the submerged culture medium was observed. We propose an approach to obtain , through the use of black tea extracts as the nutrient medium component , large amounts of G. applanatum seeding mycelia; the extract exerts a profound positive effect on the level of phenolic-type antioxidants.
