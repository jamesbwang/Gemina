  TC1/Mariner transposons belong to class II transposable elements ( TEs) that use DNA-mediated `` cut and paste '' mechanism to transpose , and they have been identified in almost all organisms. Although silkworm ( Bombyx mori) has a large amount of TC1/Mariner elements , the genome wide information of this superfamily in the silkworm is unknown. In this study , we have identified 2670 TC1/Mariner ( Bmmar) elements in the silkworm genome. All the TEs were classified into 22 families by means of fgclust , a tool of repetitive sequence classification , seven of which was first reported in this study. Phylogenetic and structure analyses based on the catalytic domain ( DDxD/E) of transposase sequences indicated that all members of TC1/Mariner were grouped into five subgroups: Mariner , Tc1 , maT , DD40D and DD41D/E. Of these five subgroups , maT rather than Mariner possessed most members of TC1/Mariner ( 51.23 %) in the silkworm genome. In particular , phylogenetic analysis and structure analysis revealed that Bmmar15 ( DD40D) formed a new basal subgroup of TC1/Mariner element in insects , which was referred to as bmori. Furthermore , we concluded that DD40D appeared to intermediate between mariner and Tc1. Finally , we estimated the insertion time for each copy of TC1/Mariner in the silkworm and found that most of members were dramatically amplified during a period from 0 to 1 mya. Moreover , the detailed functional data analysis showed that Bmmar1 , Bmmar6 and Bmmar9 had EST evidence and intact transposases. These implied that TC1/Mariner might have potential transpositional activity. In conclusion , this study provides some new insights into the landscape , origin and evolution of TC1/Mariner in the insect genomes.
