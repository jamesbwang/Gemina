  Noble metal nanoparticles are well known for their unique optical properties. Density oscillations of the nanoparticle conduction electrons are induced at a specific frequency by an external incident light beam. This phenomenon is known under the term localized surface plasmon resonance ( LSPR). The spectral position of the resonance band is determined by shape , size , and material of the nanoparticle and influenced by changes of the local refractive index of the surrounding medium. The latter gives the opportunity to use noble metal nanoparticles as label-free bioanalytical sensors. Biomolecules can be bound directly on the nanoparticle surface , which leads to a change of the local refractive index , and a shift of the peak maximum is detected by absorbance spectroscopy. This method is used for bioanalytical diagnostics. Here , a DNA sensing protocol for real-time measurements in situ using this system will be presented. A dense layer of noble metal nanoparticles is immobilized on a glass substrate and implemented in a microfluidic chamber , where the spectroscopic measurements are conducted.
