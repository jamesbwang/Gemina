  Aim The primary aim of the study was to describe the perioperative care ensured on a daily basis to prevent surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> in Italian neurosurgeries; the secondary aim was to explore surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> 30 days after the surgical procedures. Methods Patients cared for in 16 neurosurgical units who ( a) were â‰¥ 18 years of age , ( b) underwent neurosurgical procedures , and ( c) were willing to participate in the study were taken into account. Results A total of 383 patients were included. A preoperative shower was performed in 332 cases ( 86.7 %) , shaving in 318 ( 83 %) cases , and antibiotic prophylaxis was administered in 293 ( 76.5 %) cases. Surgical<disease> site disinfection was performed mainly with povidone-iodine ( 344; 89.8 %). A surgical site dressing was applied in 376 ( 98.2 %) cases and was changed on average after 37.8 h for shaved and 39h for non-shaved patients. Postoperative shampooing was performed only in 74 ( 19.3 %) cases. Surgical<disease> site<disease> infection<disease> at 30 days occurred in three ( 0.8 %) patients. Perioperative care aimed at preventing surgical<disease> site<disease> infections<disease> is variable across Italian neurosurgical units. More studies aimed at developing evidence capable of supporting decision-making processes in neurosurgery care are strongly recommended.
