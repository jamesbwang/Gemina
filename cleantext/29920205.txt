  Na-ion batteries are one of the best technologies for large-scale applications depending on almost infinite and widespread sodium resources. However , the state-of-the-art separators can not meet the engineering needs of large-scale sodium-ion batteries to match the intensively investigated electrode materials. Here , a kind of flexible modified cellulose acetate separator ( MCA) for sodium-ion batteries was synthesized via the electrospinning process and subsequently optimizing the interface chemical groups by changing acetyl to hydroxyl partly. Upon the rational design , the flexible MCA separator exhibits high chemical stability and excellent wettability ( contact angles nearly 0 °) in electrolytes ( EC/PC , EC/DMC , diglyme , and triglyme). Moreover , the flexible MCA separator shows high onset temperature of degradation ( over 250 °C) and excellent thermal stability ( no shrinkage at 220 °C). Electrochemical measurements , importantly , show that the Na-ion batteries with flexible MCA separator exhibit ultralong cycle life ( 93.78 % , 10000 cycles) and high rate capacity ( 100.1 mAh g
