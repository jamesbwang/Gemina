  Invasive species are a global threat to biodiversity. Cases where the invasion has been tracked since its beginning are rare , however , such that the first interactions between invasive and native species remain poorly understood. Communication behavior is an integral part of species identity and is subject to selection. Consequently , resource use and direct interference competition between native and invasive species may drive its evolution. Here , we tested the role of interactions between the recently introduced invasive lizard
