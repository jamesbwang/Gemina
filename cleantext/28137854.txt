  Columnar mass concentrations of aerosol components over the Arctic are estimated using microphysical parameters derived from direct sun extinction and sky radiance measurements of Aerosol Robotic Network. Aerosol optical , microphysical , chemical and radiative properties show that Arctic aerosols are dominated by fine mode particles , especially for high aerosol load cases. The average aerosol optical depth ( AOD) of the selected Arctic sites in the sampling period is approximately 0.08 , with 75 % composed of fine mode particles. The fine mode fraction mostly exceeds 0.9 when AOD greater than 0.4. The ammonium sulfate-like component ( AS) contributes about 68 % of total dry aerosol mass for high-AOD events. The estimated compositions and back trajectories show that the transported aerosol particles from biomass burning events have large amounts of black carbon ( BC) and brown carbon , while those from pollution events are characterised by large AS fractions. The instantaneous radiative forcing at the top-of-atmosphere is higher for the more absorbing components , and varies greatly with surface albedo and solar zenith angle.
