  Global tuberculosis<disease> ( TB) targets were set as part of the World Health Organization 's End TB Strategy ( 2016-2035) and the Sustainable Development Goals ( 2016-2030). To define and explain the rationale for these targets. Scenarios for plausible reductions in TB deaths and cases were developed using empirical evidence from best-performing countries and modelling of the scale-up of under-used interventions and hypothetical TB vaccines. Results were discussed at consultations in 2012 and 2013. A final proposal was presented to the World Health Assembly in 2014 and unanimously endorsed by all Member States. The 2030 targets are a 90 % reduction in TB deaths and 80 % reduction in TB incidence compared with 2015 levels. The 2035 targets are for reductions of 95 % and 90 % , respectively. A third target-that no TB-affected households experience catastrophic costs due to the disease by 2020-was also agreed. The global TB targets and milestones set for the period 2016-2035 are ambitious. Achieving them requires concerted action on several fronts , but two things are fundamental: 1) progress towards universal health coverage to ensure that everyone with TB can access high-quality treatment; and 2) substantial investment in research and development for new tools to prevent TB disease among the approximately 1.7 billion people infected.
