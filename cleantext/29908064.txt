  The RNA-binding proteins play essential roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. While hundreds of RNA-binding proteins can be predicted computationally , the recent introduction of proteome-wide approaches has dramatically expanded the repertoire of proteins interacting with RNA. Besides canonical RNA-binding proteins that contain characteristic RNA-binding domains , many proteins that lack such domains but have other well-characterized cellular functions were identified; including metabolic enzymes , heat shock<symptom> proteins , kinases , as well as transcription factors and chromatin-associated proteins. In the context of these recently published RNA-protein interactome datasets obtained from yeast , nematodes , flies , plants and mammalian cells , we discuss examples for seemingly evolutionary conserved ` unconventional ' RNA-binding proteins that act in central carbon metabolism , stress response or regulation of transcription.
