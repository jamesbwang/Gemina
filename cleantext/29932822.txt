  Numerous studies have found that shame increases individuals ' anger at others. However , according to recent theories about the social function of shame and anger at others , it is possible that shame controls individuals ' anger at others in specific conditions. We replicated previous findings that shame increased individuals ' anger at others ' unfairness , when others were not aware of the individual 's experience of shameful events. We also found for the first time that shame controlled or even decreased individuals ' anger at others ' unfairness , when others were aware of the individual 's experience of shameful events. The results were consistent when shame was induced by either a recall paradigm or an imagination paradigm , and in either the ultimatum game or the dictator game. This suggests that shame strategically controls individuals ' anger at others to demonstrate that they are willing to benefit others , when facing the risk of social exclusion. Our findings highlight the interpersonal function of shame and deepen the understanding of the relationship between shame and anger at others.
