  To evaluate by 3-dimensional ( 3-D) finite element analysis the stress generated on overdenture-retaining bar system with different cross sections ( round , ovoid , or Hader) and misfit levels ( 50 , 100 , and 200 Î¼m) manufactured with different metallic alloys ( Au type IV , Ag-Pd , Ti cp , and Co-Cr). Three-dimensional finite element models were modeled using specific 3-D software ( SolidWorks) and imported into mechanical simulation software ( ANSYS). A displacement simulating the settlement of the screw was performed until the infrastructure was settled properly on the prosthetic platform. Higher misfit levels caused higher stress on the overdenture-retaining bar system components , where ( 1) Hader bar presented the highest values ( bar = 730.71; screw = 59.66 , and periimplant bone tissue = 42.96 , in megapascal) and ( 2) round bars made with type IV Au alloy presented lower stress values on the bar framework ( 193.99 MPa) and screw ( 10.27 MPa). Higher vertical misfit increased the stress values on the overdenture-retaining bar system; complex cross-sectional designs increased stress values on the bar framework , prosthetic screw , and periimplant bone tissue; stiffer alloys caused higher stress values on all the studied conditions.
