  Methoxyphenols as the potential tracers for wood smoke emissions , are emitted into the atmosphere in large quantities but their atmospheric chemical behaviors have not been well characterized. In this work , heterogeneous kinetics of methoxyphenols in the OH-initiated reactions was investigated using a flow reactor under different experimental conditions. The average second-order rate constants ( k
