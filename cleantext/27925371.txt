  The ability to communicate is a crucial graduate outcome for science students; however , crowded curricula and large class sizes make it difficult to find time to explicitly teach foundational communication skills. In response to these challenges , we developed an online resource called Communication Learning in Practice for Scientists , or CLIPS. CLIPS provides a multi-point mentoring model that has allowed us to successfully integrate the teaching and learning of a complex set of tacitly-understood skills across multiple scientific disciplines. It also provides a flexible way for industry experts , academics , and students to learn from one another 's experiences of , and expertise in , science communication. CLIPS leverages the student focus on assessment; students access CLIPS for pragmatic , detailed , and consistent advice when undertaking assessment tasks. In creating CLIPS , our philosophy was that communication is the core business of any scientific practice , not an add-on after the event. Extensive , repeated use of CLIPS by both students and academics indicates that the resource and its delivery model are considered useful , respected , and impactful for , and by , the intended audiences. We have provided CLIPS to the science education community through www.clips.edu.au.
