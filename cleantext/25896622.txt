  To evaluate the neurotrophin mRNA expression and axon count in the median nerve of Wistar rats submitted to neural mobilization ( NM) after nerve compression. Eighteen animals were randomly divided into G1 ( nerve compression only) , G2 ( NM for 1 min) , and G3 ( NM for 3 min). For NM , the animals were anesthetized and the right scapula received the mobilization , adapted as indicated for humans , on alternate days , from the third to the 13th postoperative ( PO) day , totaling six days of therapy. On the 14th PO day , animals were anesthetized and euthanized. Fragments of the median nerve , distal to the compression procedure , were removed for histomorphometric analysis and expression of neurotrophins , nerve growth factor ( NGF) , and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) by RT-PCR. Histomorphometric analysis revealed differences in the number of axons in the injured side , which was significantly lower in the injured limb<symptom> nerve compared to the control limb , whereas the RT-PCR analysis showed no significant differences in the expression of NGF or BDNF. NM treatment did not affect median nerve regeneration , which maintained normal recovery rates.
