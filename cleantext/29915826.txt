  Despite their extensive industrial usage , glass-forming liquids are not fully understood , and methods to investigate their dynamical heterogeneity are sought after. Here we show how the appearance of a second component in the visible absorption spectrum of a photosynthetic pigment upon cooling can be used to probe the glass transition of a dimethylsulfoxide-water mixture. The changes in the relative ratio of the two components with respect to temperature follow a sigmoid curve , and we show that the second component arises due to protonation of the pigment at low temperatures. Furthermore , from visible transient absorption spectra we show that , unlike the first component , the dynamics of the second component slows down significantly at lower temperatures , suggesting that there are two distinct environments with fast and slow fluctuations. Our results therefore enable a new method to characterize the dynamical heterogeneity of glass-forming liquids.
