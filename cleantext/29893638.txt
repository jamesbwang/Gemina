  `` Passing the trash , '' enabling teachers who sexually abuse students to pursue another job with no record of their sexual misconduct , is common practice for K-12 school district administrators who fear legal liability and tarnished reputations. The `` Prohibition on Aiding and Abetting Sexual Abuse '' provision in the United States Every Student Succeeds Act ( ESSA) of 2015 aims to eliminate passing the trash. This study explores states ' progress toward developing and implementing relevant law and policy to comply with the provision. Researchers collected data from representatives of state departments of education , asking whether representatives were aware of the provision and what progress their state had made toward complying with it. Overall , researchers found that just four states had fully complied; several others were in the process of creating relevant policy and legislation and a few began the process in response to researchers ' queries. However , the overwhelming majority of states-39-had no plans to create relevant legislation or policy , either because they were unaware of the provision or because they believed , erroneously , that existing laws fulfilled the ESSA mandate. Passing the trash is clearly an unacceptable practice , yet research suggests it still occurs , and state-level laws and policies to prevent it are slow to emerge. The lack of knowledge or awareness exhibited by many state representatives suggests a need to educate policymakers and education leaders about what aiding and abetting sexual offenders consists of , what consequences it can have for vulnerable students , and what provisions states can enact to prohibit it.
