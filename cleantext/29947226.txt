  Ultrathin metal-organic framework ( MOF) nanosheets possessing inherent advantages of both two-dimensional ( 2D) features and MOFs are attracting intensive research interest. The direct manufacture of MOF nanosheets is still a challenge up to now. Here , we have developed a novel bottom-up approach to synthesize zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 ( ZIF-67) nanosheets , which can be in situ converted into Co
