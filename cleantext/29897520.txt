  Paradigms in the treatment of aging have evolved to address volume loss as a central and primary hallmark of the aging face. The concept of `` composite volumization '' was recently proposed by Dr. Z. Paul Lorenc to describe the effect of Radiesse ( Merz Aesthetics , Inc. , Raleigh , NC) , when placed on bone in the supraperiosteal plane , on all overlying tissues ( skin , superficial and deep fat compartments , and muscle). The physiochemical properties of Radiesse make it especially well suited for efficient and effective volumization of areas especially prone to volume loss; the temple , zygomatic arch , anterior cheek , pyriform aperture , and prejowl sulcus. Placement of Radiesse on bone in these areas creates a scaffold upon which additional restoration of fine lines and wrinkles may be accomplished , restoring a youthful appearance.
