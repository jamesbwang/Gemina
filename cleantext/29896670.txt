  Betaherpesvirus<pathogen> possesses a large genome DNA with a lot of open reading frames , indicating abundance in the variety of viral protein factors. Because the complicated pathogenicity of herpesvirus<pathogen> reflects the combined functions of these factors , analyses of individual proteins are the fundamental steps to comprehensively understand about the viral life cycle and the pathogenicity. In this chapter , structural aspects of the betaherpesvirus-encoded proteins are introduced. Betaherpesvirus-encoded proteins of which structural information is available were summarized and subcategorized into capsid proteins , tegument proteins , nuclear egress complex proteins , envelope glycoproteins , enzymes , and immune-modulating factors. Structure of capsid proteins are analyzed in capsid by electron cryomicroscopy at quasi-atomic resolution. Structural information of teguments is limited , but a recent crystallographic analysis of an essential tegument protein of human<pathogen> herpesvirus<pathogen> 6B is introduced. As for the envelope glycoproteins , crystallographic analysis of glycoprotein gB has been done , revealing the fine-tuned structure and the distribution of its antigenic domains. gH/gL structure of betaherpesvirus<pathogen> is not available yet , but the overall shape and the spatial arrangement of the accessory proteins are analyzed by electron microscopy. Nuclear egress complex was analyzed from the structural perspective in 2015 , with the structural analysis of cytomegalovirus UL50/UL53. The category `` enzymes '' includes the viral protease , DNA polymerase and terminase for which crystallographic analyses have been done. The immune-modulating factors are viral ligands or receptors for immune regulating factors of host immune cells , and their communications with host immune molecules are demonstrated in the aspect of molecular structure.
