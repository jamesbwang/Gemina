  We report initial results from an ion mobility spectrometry ( IMS)- based analysis of natural cannabis samples and explore the possibility of using this technique to distinguish medical marijuana from illegal forms of the drug , as defined by Swiss legislation. We analyzed cannabis extracts by electrospray ionization IMS-MS and found that high-resolution drift-tube IMS ( R > 150) can effectively isolate and quantify the controlled substance , Î”9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC) , even in the presence of other noncontrolled cannabinoid isomers including cannabidiol ( CBD). We used this information to determine whether the THC content of a given sample surpassed the legal limit , which is 1 % by weight in Switzerland. Our IMS-MS methodology produced equivalent quantification results to standard HPLC-based methods and offers the additional advantage of significantly shorter time requirements for the analysis. In addition , IMS-based analysis offers flexibility over HPLC in that it can be performed on portable devices. As such , these findings may have implications for cannabis testing in police laboratories.
