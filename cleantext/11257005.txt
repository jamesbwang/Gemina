  The role of caveolin-1 ( CAV1) ( G > A , rs3807987) polymorphism is still dubious in cancer causation in Taiwanese population. The present study is an effort to assess the above relation for precise conclusion. EMBASE and PubMed ( MEDLINE) databases were explored for the pertinent case-control studies reporting the connection of CAV1 G14713A polymorphism to the vulnerability to cancer. A cumulative analysis using meta-analytic approach was accomplished and pooled odds ratios ( ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs) were estimated for all the polymorphs. Overall , 2549 subjects and 3161 controls were analyzed from six selected studies. Our study showed no confirmation of noteworthy risk between CAV1 G14713A polymorphism and susceptibility to cancer in any of the polymorph , for instance , allele ( A vs. G: We conclude that CAV1 G14713A polymorphism does not contribute as an independent predisposing risk factor for developing cancer in Taiwanese population.
