  Knee and hip replacement surgery are still the mainstay therapy for osteoarthritis. In spite of the improvement of techniques and implants , anemia<symptom> is a relatively common complication , with transfusion rates of up to 23 % in some centers. The purpose of the study was to determine a correlation of transfusions to complications including infection since this topic is still being debated or even disputed in the literature. This is a level III , single center retrospective observational cohort study of 2760 unilateral primary knee and hip replacements. Preoperative assessment , the number of transfusions and the occurrence of complications were collected and the correlations were analyzed using analysis of variance and logistic regression. Fifteen percent of all patients developed at least one complication. Transfusion rate was 9 %. Risk factors for receiving a transfusion were female gender , hip replacement , American Society of Anesthesiologists ' Score ( ASA) > III , history of myocardial infarction , chronic cardiac disease , diabetes mellitus , chronic kidney disease , and length of surgery. The risk factors for developing a complication were: ASA score , presence of chronic renal insufficiency , and transfusion during hospital stay. Transfusion increases the risk of complications and infection rate. Complication rate with transfusion was 34.7 % and without transfusion 13.2 %. Infection rate without transfusion was 0.4 % and with transfusion 2.82 %. The complication rate is higher in transfused patients. The number of complications rises linearly with the number of transfusions. Infection rate is also higher after a transfusion. Efforts should be made to reduce the transfusion rate.
