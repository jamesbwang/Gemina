  The incidence of acute kidney injury ( AKI) is high in elderly people , and is difficult to prevent and treat. One of its major causes is renal ischemia-reperfusion injury ( IRI). A young systemic environment may prevent the senescence of old organs. However , it is unknown whether a young milieu may reduce renal IRI in the elderly. To examine this question , bilateral renal IRI was induced in old ( 24 months) mice three weeks after parabiosis model establishment. At 24 hours after IRI , compared to old wild-type mice , the old mice with IRI had significantly damaged renal histology , decreased renal function , increased oxidative stress , inflammation<symptom> , and apoptosis. However , there was no increase in autophagy. Compared to old mice with IRI , old-old parabiosis mice with IRI did not show differences in renal histological damage , oxidative stress , inflammation<symptom> , apoptosis , or autophagy , but did exhibit improved renal function. Compared to the old-old parabiosis mice with IRI , the old mice with IRI in the young ( 12 week)- old parabiosis showed less renal histological injury and better renal function. Renal oxidative stress , inflammation<symptom> , and apoptosis were significantly decreased , and autophagy was significantly increased. Thus , a youthful systemic milieu may decrease oxidative stress , inflammation<symptom> , and apoptosis , and increase autophagy in old mice with IRI. These effects ameliorated IRI injuries in old mice. Our study provides new ideas for effectively preventing and treating AKI in the elderly.
