  Smoking and drinking are two predisposing factors for dyslipidemia. Exercise has been proposed as a strategy to improve the blood lipids. However , it remains unclear how smoking and drinking jointly affect blood lipids and whether exercise influences their effects. To evaluate the effects of smoking and drinking , either alone or in combination , on lipid-related indices in both exercise and non-exercise groups among Chinese men. This study was conducted in a health examination center between 2015 and 2016. A sample of 6,179 male subjects was divided into exercise and non-exercise groups. Logistic and linear regression analyses were used to calculate the odds ratios for abnormal lipid-related indices and correlation coefficients between smoking/drinking and lipid-related indices. In the study population , the percentage of stable smokers and stable drinkers was 46.3 % ( 2,860/ 6,179) and 77.6 % ( 4,795/ 6,179) , respectively. An increased smoking amount was significantly associated with an elevated triglyceride ( TG) level and a decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C) level. Heavier smokers had higher odds ratios for high TG and low HDL-C. Heavier drinkers had higher levels of total cholesterol ( TC) , TG , and HDL-C and higher odds ratios for high TC and high TG but lower odds ratio for low HDL-C. The exercise group had lower TG levels and higher HDL-C levels than did the non-exercise group. Both heavier smoking and heavier drinking were associated with poorer TG levels , and the results suggest that drinking may be helpful for HDL-C. Exercise may relieve the negative effects of smoking and drinking.
