  We investigate Andreev transport through a quantum dot attached to two external ferromagnetic leads and one superconducting electrode. The transport properties of the system are studied by means of the real-time diagrammatic technique in the sequential tunneling regime. To distinguish various contributions to Andreev current we calculate the current cross-correlations , i.e. correlations between currents flowing through two junctions with normal leads. We analyze dependence of current cross-correlations on various parameters of the considered model , both in linear and nonlinear transport regimes. The processes and mechanisms leading to enhancement , suppression or sign change of current cross-correlations are examined and discussed. Interestingly , our results show that for specific transport regimes splitted Cooper pair results in two uncorrelated electrons. However , utilizing ferromagnetic leads instead of non-magnetic electrodes can result in positive current cross-correlations.
