  Systemic sclerosis ( SSc) is a multisystemic autoimmune disease. Few studies have focused on the outcomes of SSC patients who require intensive care unit ( ICU) admission , largely due to the absence of protocols for the optimal management of this disease during an ICU stay. This study aimed to describe the outcomes of a series of SSc patients admitted to the ICU at a single center in Cali , Colombia. Case series of SSc patients admitted to the ICU were retrospectively reviewed. The main outcome was ICU mortality. Statistical analysis was performed with measures of central tendency and proportions. All the patients ( n = 14) were female and either middle-aged or elderly; 9 ( 64 %) were diagnosed with diffuse cutaneous sclerosis , and the remaining 5 patients with limited cutaneous sclerosis. Some were readmitted; therefore , the total number of ICU admissions was 21. The principal causes of ICU admissions were non-SSc-related causes ( n = 15 ( 71.4 %)). The respiratory system was the most involved on ICU admission. The ICU mortality rate was 43 % ( n = 6). The severity of the disease at ICU admission and comorbidity are independently associated with ICU-related mortality. Furthermore , the optimal management of SSc patients includes accurate detection of SSc-associated organ involvement. More studies involving this category of patients are needed to establish the best effective protocols.
