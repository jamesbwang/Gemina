  The recharge of reclaimed water is an effective strategy for addressing the issues of water quality deterioration and groundwater level decline simultaneously. Residual Al coagulants are normally remained in the recovered water at low concentrations , and may induce clogging problems during the recharging process. However , this issue has been ignored in the past. In this study , we investigated the mechanisms of Al ( III)- induced aquifer bio-clogging , the role of Al ( III) in quartz sand media ( SiO
