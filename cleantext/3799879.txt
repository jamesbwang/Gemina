  Between-leg strength differences can negatively influence sprint acceleration. The challenge is to find a method to measure this within a unilateral exercise. This study analyzed a five repetition-maximum ( 5RM) Bulgarian split-squat ( BSS) to identify between-leg differences for the dominant and non-dominant legs in peak and mean power , force , and velocity as measured by a linear position transducer. Between-leg differences in these variables were correlated with 20-m ( 0 ⁻ 5 , 0 ⁻ 10 , 0 ⁻ 20 m intervals) sprint velocity. Eight men were assessed in the 5RM BSS and 20-m sprint. T-tests calculated between-leg differences in power , force , and velocity. Spearman 's correlations calculated relationships between the between-leg differences in the mechanical variables with velocity over each interval. When comparing the dominant and non-dominant legs , there were significant (
