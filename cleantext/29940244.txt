  Atherosclerosis ( AS) , a chronic arterial disease , is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Several treatment modalities have been demonstrated to be effective in treating AS; however , the mortality rate due to AS remains high. Sonodynamic therapy ( SDT) is a promising new treatment using low-intensity ultrasound in combination with sonosensitizers. Although SDT was developed from photodynamic therapy ( PDT) , it has a stronger tissue-penetrating capability and exhibits a more focused effect on the target lesional site requiring treatment. Furthermore , SDT has been demonstrated to suppress the formation of atheromatous plaques , and it can increase plaque stability both in vitro and in vivo. In this article , we critically summarize the recent literature on SDT , focusing on its possible mechanism of action as well as the existing and newly discovered sonosensitizers and chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of AS.
