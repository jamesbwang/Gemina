  Postoperative pancreatic fistula<disease> ( POPF) is the most common critical complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD) and a primary reason for increased mortality and morbidity after PD. To perform a safe pancreaticojejunostomy ( PJ) , a fast and simple technique of duct-to-mucosa PJ with one-layer suture was devised at our institution. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 81 successive cases of PD performed at our hospital from March 2012 to August 2016. Data of perioperative parameters were collected for all PD cases. A total of 17 ( 21.0 %) cases of morbidity occurred after PD , including 5 ( 6.1 %) cases of POPF ( grade A) , 8 ( 9.8 %) cases of delayed gastric emptying , 1 ( 1.2 %) case of abdominal<disease> infection<disease> , and 3 ( 3.7 %) cases of incision infection. The median operative time for the PJ was 7 min. No mortality or relaparotomy was observed. Our technique could significantly reduce the incidence of POPF and other complications after PD and may be a promising technique for pancreaticoenteric anastomosis.
