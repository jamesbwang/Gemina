  Deaths in developing countries often occur outside health facilities , making it extremely difficult to gather reliable cause of death ( COD) information. Automated COD assignment using a verbal autopsy instrument ( VAI) has been proposed as a reliable and cost-effective alternative to traditional physician-certified verbal autopsy , but its performance is still being evaluated. The purpose of this study was to compare the similarity of diagnosis by Medical Assistants ( MA) in the Matlab Health and Demographic Surveillance System ( HDSS) with the SmartVA Analyze 1.2 ( Tariff 2.0) diagnosis. This study took place between January 2011 and April 2014 in Matlab , Bangladesh. MA with 3 years of medical training assigned COD to Matlab residents by reviewing the information collected using the Population Health Metrics Research Consortium ( PHMRC) long-form VAI. Smart VA Analyze 1.2 automatically assigned COD using the same questionnaire. COD agreement and cause-specific mortality fractions ( CSMFs) were compared for MA and Tariff. Of the 4969 verbal autopsy cases reviewed , 4328 were adults , 296 were children , and 345 were neonates. Cohen 's kappa was 0.38 ( 0.36 , 0.40) for adults , 0.43 ( 0.38 , 0.49) for children , and 0.27 ( 0.22 , 0.33) for neonates. For adults , the top two COD for MA were stroke ( 29.6 %) and ischemic heart diseases ( IHD) ( 14.2 %) and for Tariff these were stroke ( 32.0 %) and IHD ( 14.0 %). For children , the top two COD for MA were drowning ( 33.5 %) and pneumonia<disease> ( 13.2 %) and for Tariff these were also drowning ( 36.8 %) and pneumonia<disease> ( 12.4 %). For neonates , the top two COD for MA were birth asphyxia ( 41.2 %) and meningitis/sepsis ( 22.3 %) and for Tariff these were birth asphyxia ( 37.0 %) and preterm delivery ( 30.9 %). The CSMFs for Tariff and MA showed very close agreement across all age categories but some differences were observed for neonate preterm delivery and meningitis/sepsis. Given the known advantages of automated methods over physician certified verbal autopsy , the SmartVA software , incorporating the shortened VAI questionnaire and Tariff 2.0 , could serve as a cost-effective alternative to Matlab MA to routinely collect and analyze verbal autopsy data in a HDSS to generate essential population level COD data for planning.
