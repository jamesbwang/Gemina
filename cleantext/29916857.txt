  Serum lactate levels are routinely measured in critically ill patients with cirrhosis , and hyperlactatemia is a common finding , but its prognostic value remains controversial. Our aim was to examine whether serum lactate level could be used as a predictor of outcome in critically ill patients with cirrhosis ( CICP) with acute kidney injury ( AKI). In this study , we included 480 consecutive patients with cirrhosis admitted to ICU , complicated with AKI , and were followed up for 365 days. Patients were divided into four groups ( Q1-Q4) by serum lactate quartiles: Q1 ≤ 1.8 mg/dl , Q2 = 1.9-2.4 mg/dl , Q3 = 2.5-4.0 mg/dl , and Q4 ≥ 4.1 mg/dl. The hazard ratio ( HR) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs) for hospital mortality were calculated across each quartile of serum lactate , using the Q1 as reference , and four models were built to adjust for the HR of mortality. Compared with patients in the survival group , nonsurvivors had higher serum lactate levels. Mortality rate increased progressively as the serum lactate level increased ( Q1: 56.06 % , Q2: 62.16 % , Q3: 72.73 % and Q4: 75.86 %) , and this relationship remained statistically significant after rigorous control of confounding factors in Q2 , Q3 , and Q4 with HRs of 1.03 ( 95 % CI: 0.73-1.46) , 1.40 ( 95 % CI: 1.01-1.95) , and 1.84 ( 95 % CI: 1.28-2.64) , respectively. Our study brings a new perspective to the role of lactate monitoring in CICP with AKI. Elevated serum lactate levels are associated with a higher mortality rate in CICP with AKI. Elevated serum lactate levels should be part of rapid diagnosis and initiation of therapy to improve clinical outcome.
