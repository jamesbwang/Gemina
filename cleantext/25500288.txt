  We report a rare and serious complication of cardiac strangulation arising from the implantation of epicardial pacing leads in a newborn. Patient 's follow-up 9-month postsurgery revealed compression under the pulmonary valve annulus by a pacemaker lead , causing progressive stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract. The epicardial leads were replaced to relieve compression , and stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract was rectified. Pacemaker implantation in newborns is not without challenges; epicardial leads should be carefully positioned to avoid any compression of cardiac structures.
