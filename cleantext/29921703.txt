  Online social media are information resources that can have a transformative power in society. While the Web was envisioned as an equalizing force that allows everyone to access information , the digital divide prevents large amounts of people from being present online. Online social media , in particular , are prone to gender inequality , an important issue given the link between social media use and employment. Understanding gender inequality in social media is a challenging task due to the necessity of data sources that can provide large-scale measurements across multiple countries. Here , we show how the Facebook Gender Divide ( FGD) , a metric based on aggregated statistics of more than 1.4 billion users in 217 countries , explains various aspects of worldwide gender inequality. Our analysis shows that the FGD encodes gender equality indices in education , health , and economic opportunity. We find gender differences in network externalities that suggest that using social media has an added value for women. Furthermore , we find that low values of the FGD are associated with increases in economic gender equality. Our results suggest that online social networks , while suffering evident gender imbalance , may lower the barriers that women have to access to informational resources and help to narrow the economic gender gap.
