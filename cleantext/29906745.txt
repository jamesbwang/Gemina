  Emerging evidence reveal that long noncoding RNAs ( lncRNAs) participates in the epigenetic regulation of pathophysiological process. However , the deepgoing role of lncRNAs on meningioma is still unclear. In present study , we investigate the roles of lncRNA LINC00460 in meningeoma tissue and uncover its molecular mechanism. Results revealed that LINC00460 expression level was significantly up-regulated in meningeoma tissues and malignant meningeoma cell lines ( IOMM-Lee , CH157-MN). Mechanically , loss-of-function assays showed that LINC00460 knockdown significantly suppressed the proliferation ability , increased the apoptosis and decreased the proteins ( MMP-2 , MMP-9 , ZEB1) expression. Bioinformatics tools predicted that miR-539 both targeted with the 3 '- UTR of LINC00460 and MMP-9 mRNA , which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis. In summary , our study reveals that LINC00460 promotes MMP-9 expression through targeting miR-539 , acting as an oncogenic RNA in the meningeoma malignancy and accelerating the proliferation and metastasis of meningeoma.
