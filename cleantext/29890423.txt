  In this article , smoke suppression of Si-Al mesoporous structure on medium density fiberboard ( MDF) was investigated by cone calorimeter test ( CCT) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , thermal gravimetric analysis ( TGA) , and fourier transform infrared spectrometry ( FTIR). The CCT results show that the Si-Al mesoporous structure can effectively decrease heat release rate ( HRR) , total heat release ( THR) , smoke production rate ( SPR) , total smoke production ( TSP) , smoke rate ( SR) , CO and CO
