  Hyperosmolar therapy is regarded as the mainstay for treatment of elevated intracranial pressure ( ICP) in traumatic brain injury ( TBI). This still has been disputed as application of hypertonic saline ( HS) or mannitol for treating patients with severe TBI. Thus , this meta-analysis was performed to further compare the advantages and disadvantages of mannitol with HS for treating elevated ICP after TBI. We conducted a systematic search on PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL) , Wan Fang Data , VIP Data , SinoMed , and China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( CNKI) databases. Studies were included or not based on the quality assessment by the Jadad scale and selection criteria. Twelve RCTs with 438 patients were enrolled for the meta-analysis. The comparison of HS and mannitol indicated that they were close in field of improving function outcome ( RR = 1.17 , 95 % CI 0.89 to 1.54 , p = 0.258) and reducing intracranial pressure ( MD =- 0.16 , 95 % CI:- 0.59 to 0.27 , p = 0.473) and mortality ( RR = 0.78 , 95 % CI 0.53 to 1.16 , p = 0.216). The pooled relative risk of successful ICP control was 1.06 ( 95 % CI: 1.00 to 1.13 , p = 0.044) , demonstrating that HS was more effective than mannitol in ICP management. Both serum sodium ( WMD = 5.30 , 95 % CI: 4.37 to 6.22 , p < 0.001) and osmolality ( WMD = 3.03 , 95 % CI: 0.18 to 5.88 , p = 0.037) were increased after injection of hypertonic saline. The results do not lend a specific recommendation to select hypertonic saline or mannitol as a first-line for the patients with elevated ICP caused by TBI. However , for the refractory intracranial hypertension , hypertonic saline seems to be preferred.
