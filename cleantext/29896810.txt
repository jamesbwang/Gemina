  Simian retrovirus ( SRV) is a type-D betaretrovirus infectious to the Old World monkeys causing a variety of symptoms. SRVs are also present in the Old World monkey genomes as endogenous forms , which are referred to as Simian endogenous retroviruses ( SERVs). Although many SERV sequences have been identified in Cercopithecinae genomes , with potential of encoding all functional genes , the distribution of SERVs in genomes and evolutionary relationship between exogeneous SRVs and SERVs remains unclear. In this study , we comprehensively investigated seven draft genome sequences of the Old World monkeys , and identified a novel cluster of SERVs in the two Rhinopithecus ( R. roxellana and R. bieti) genomes , which belong to the Colobinae subfamily. The Rhinopithecus genomes harbored higher copy numbers of SERVs than the Cercopithecinae genomes. A reconstructed phylogenetic tree showed that the Colobinae SERVs formed a distinct cluster from SRVs and Cercopithecinae SERVs , and more closely related to exogenous SRVs than Cercopithecinae SERVs. Three radical amino acid substitutions specific to Cercopithecinae SERVs , which potentially affect the infectious ability of SERVs , were also identified in the proviral envelope protein. In addition , we found many integration events of SERVs were genus- or species-specific , suggesting the recent activity of SERVs in the Old World monkey genomes. The results suggest that SERVs in Cercopithecinae and Colobinae monkeys were endogenized after the divergence of subfamilies and do not transmit across subfamilies. Our findings also support the hypothesis that Colobinae SERVs are direct ancestors of SRV-6 , which has a different origin from the other exogenous SRVs. These findings shed novel insight into the evolutionary history of SERVs , and may help to understand the process of endogenization of SRVs.
