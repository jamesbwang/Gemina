  To elucidate the factors affecting the catalytic properties of supported Au catalysts on the metal oxide support we investigated Au NPs deposited on crystallized mesoporous transition-metal oxides ( m-oxides: Co3O4 , NiO , and Î±-Fe2O3) prepared using the nanocasting method. The metal-oxide interaction in Au/mesoporous oxides resulted in higher catalytic activity for converting methanol to CO2 as a full oxidation product than pure m-oxides. Au/m-Fe 2O3 exhibited high activity and low selectivity for methyl formate as a partial oxidative coupling product. We correlate the change in activity and selectivity with the interface between the Au and m-oxides.
