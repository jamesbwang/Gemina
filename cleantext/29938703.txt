  Globally , an estimated 36.9 million persons are living with HIV/AIDS , and approximately 291 million women worldwide are carriers of human<pathogen> papillomavirus<pathogen> ( HPV<pathogen>). A large number of women currently infected with either or both viruses constitute a large burden on the national health care system. Women with HIV<pathogen> have significantly higher rates of HPV<pathogen> infections than women without HIV<pathogen>. Approximately 77 % of women with HIV<pathogen> are carriers of HPV<pathogen>. While research has established a linkage between HIV<pathogen> and progression to cervical cancer in general , there are currently no review articles exploring the role HIV<pathogen> has in the progression from HPV<pathogen> to each stage of carcinogenesis that leads to cervical cancer. The objective of this review is to examine the relationship between HIV<pathogen> and progression from HPV<pathogen> to each stage of carcinogenesis related to cervical cancer. The findings of the review support the conclusion that HIV<pathogen> infection increases the likelihood of progression to each stage of the HPV<pathogen> to cervical cancer pathway.
