  Studies of source apportionment ( SA) for particulate matter ( PM) air pollution have enhanced understanding of dominant pollution sources and quantification of their contribution. Although there have been many SA studies in South Korea over the last two decades , few studies provided an integrated understanding of PM sources nationwide. The aim of this study was to summarize findings of PM SA studies of South Korea and to explore study characteristics. We selected studies that estimated sources of PM In the 21 selected studies , all six PM We found that motor vehicle and secondary aerosol were the most common and influential sources for PM in South Korea. Our study , however , suggested a caution to understand SA findings from heterogeneous study features for study designs and input data.
