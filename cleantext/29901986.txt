  Multidrug resistance remains one of the main obstacles to efficient chemotherapy of colorectal cancer. Herein , an efficient combination therapeutic strategy is proposed based on porphyrin/camptothecin-floxuridine triad microbubbles ( PCF-MBs) with high drug loading contents , which own highly stable co-delivery drug combinations and no premature release. The triad PCF-MBs can act not only as a contrast agent for ultrasound ( US)/ fluorescence bimodal imaging but also a multimodal therapeutic agent for synergistic chemo-photodynamic combination therapy. Upon local ultrasound exposure under the guidance of ultrasound imaging , in situ conversion of PCF-MBs into porphyrin/camptothecin-floxuridine nanoparticles ( PCF-NPs) leads to high accumulation of chemo-drugs and photosensitizer in tumors due to the induced high permeability of the capillary wall and cell membrane temporarily via sonoporation effect , greatly reducing the risk of systemic exposure. Most importantly , it was found that the PCF-MB-mediated photodynamic therapy could significantly reduce the expression of adenosine-triphosphate ( ATP)- binding cassette subfamily G member 2 ( ABCG
