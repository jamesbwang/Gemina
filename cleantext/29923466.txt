  The early decades of the twentieth century were marked by widespread optimism about biology and its ability to improve the world. A major catalyst for this enthusiasm was new theories about inheritance and evolution ( particularly Hugo de Vries 's mutation theory and Mendel 's newly rediscovered ideas). In Britain and the USA particularly , an astonishingly diverse variety of writers ( from elite scientists to journalists and writers of fiction) took up the task of interpreting these new biological ideas , using a wide range of genres to help their fellow citizens make sense of biology 's promise. From these miscellaneous writings a new and distinctive kind of utopianism emerged- the biotopia. Biotopias offered the dream of a perfect , post-natural world , or the nightmare of violated nature ( often in the same text) , but above all they conveyed a sense that biology was- for the first time- offering humanity unprecedented control over life. Biotopias often visualized the world as a garden perfected for human use , but this vision was tinged with gendered violence , as it became clear that realizing it entailed dispossessing , or even killing , ` Mother Nature '. Biotopian themes are apparent in journalism , scientific reports and even textbooks , and these non-fiction sources shared many characteristics with intentionally prophetic or utopian fictions. Biotopian themes can be traced back and forth across the porous boundaries between popular and elite writing , showing how biology came to function as public culture. This analysis reveals not only how the historical significance of science is invariably determined outside the scientific world , but also that the ways in which biology was debated during this period continue to characterize today 's debates over new biological breakthroughs.
