  The approach to HCV infection begins with the directed search for risk factors linked to its acquisition. Therefore , our primary aim was to identify the prevalence of risk factors associated with HCV infections in insured individuals seen at the Hidalgo delegation of the IMSS. An observational , descriptive , cross-sectional study was conducted through validated surveys that identified major and minor risk factors. In cases of major risk factors , the Advanced Quality â„¢ RAPID-ANTI-HCV TEST Accutrack A total of 528 insured individuals were surveyed ( 95 % CI with a 5 % margin of error). Two hundred eighty-two rapid tests were performed. Five of them were positive ( 0.94 %) and belonged to the patients in the dialysis/hemodialysis group. A total of 71.2 % persons had positive risk factors. The association of 2 or more factors varied from 2 to 8 factors present at the same time. Of the entire study population , 6.25 % presented with 4 risk factors and 4.35 % presented with 5 risk factors at the same time. Nearly three quarters of the individuals surveyed were exposed to HCV acquisition. The association of 2 or more risk factors in patients demonstrated their collective potentiality for acquiring HCV. We identified persons receiving treatment with dialysis/hemodialysis and those with high-risk sexual practices as vulnerable groups for HCV infection and suggest that they receive promotion and prevention activities , as well as public policy management.
