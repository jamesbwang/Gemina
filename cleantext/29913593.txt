  Accurate quantification of sources of phosphorus ( P) entering the environment is essential for the management of aquatic ecosystems. P fluxes from mains water leakage ( MWL-P) have recently been identified as a potentially significant source of P in urbanised catchments. However , both the temporal dynamics of this flux and the potential future significance relative to P fluxes from wastewater treatment works ( WWT-P) remain poorly constrained. Using the River Thames catchment in England as an exemplar , we present the first quantification of both the seasonal dynamics of current MWL-P fluxes and future flux scenarios to 2040 , relative to WWT-P loads and to P loads exported from the catchment. The magnitude of the MWL-P flux shows a strong seasonal signal , with pipe burst and leakage events resulting in peak P fluxes in winter ( December , January , February) that are > 150 % of fluxes in either spring ( March , April , May) or autumn ( September , October , November). We estimate that MWL-P is equivalent to up to 20 % of WWT-P during peak leakage events. Winter rainfall events control temporal variation in both WWT-P and riverine P fluxes which consequently masks any signal in riverine P fluxes associated with MWL-P. The annual average ratio of MWL-P flux to WWT-P flux is predicted to increase from 15 to 38 % between 2015 and 2040 , associated with large increases in P removal at wastewater treatment works by 2040 relative to modest reductions in mains water leakage. However , further research is required to understand the fate of MWL-P in the environment. Future P research and management programmes should more fully consider MWL-P and its seasonal dynamics , alongside the likely impacts of this source of P on water quality.
