  To validate the enhanced therapeutic effect of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge ( SM) for brain ischemic stroke through the anti-apoptotic and survival ability of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs). The viability and the expression level of cell apoptotic and survival-related proteins in MSCs by treatment of SM were assessed in vitro. In addition , the infarcted brain region and the behavioural changes after treatment of MSCs with SM were confirmed in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAo) models. We demonstrated that SM attenuates apoptosis and improves the cell viability of MSCs. In the rat MCAo model , the recovery of the infarcted region and positive changes of behaviour are observed after treatment of MSCs with SM. The therapy using SM enhances the therapeutic effect for brain ischemic stroke by promoting the survival of MSCs. This synergetic effect thereby proposes a new experimental approach of traditional Chinese medicine and stem cell-based therapies for patients suffering from a variety of diseases.
