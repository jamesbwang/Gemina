  Dry powder inhalers ( DPI) are effective but forceful inhalation required to fluidize the powder may be difficult for children and patients with airway disease. Inspiromatic is a new generation active DPI that actively suspends drugs in synchrony with inhalation. We evaluated safety and efficacy of Formoterol delivery via Inspiromatic , compared to Aerolizer , a conventional DPI , in pediatric asthmatic subjects. A phase I/II , randomized , single-center , double-blind , double-dummy , placebo-controlled , cross-over study. Subjects aged 8-18 years with FEV Twenty-nine patients , aged 12.6 ( Â± 2.3) years , mean ( SD) , completed the study. Baseline FEV Formoterol inhalation via the Inspiromatic is safe and as efficacious as with the Aerolizer. The device is well accepted by asthmatic subjects.
