  Most recently , alkylation via photo-generated carbocations has been identified as a novel mechanism for photo-induced DNA interstrand cross-link ( ICL) formation by bifunctional aryl compounds. However , most compounds showed a low efficiency for DNA cross-linking. Here , we have developed a series of new 1,1 '- binaphthalene analogues that efficiently form DNA ICLs upon 350 nm irradiation via generated 2-naphthalenylmethyl cations. The DNA cross-linking efficiency depends on the substituents at the position-4 of the naphthalene moiety as well as the leaving groups. Compounds with NO2 , Ph , H , Br , or OMe substituents led to 2-4 times higher DNA ICL yields than those with a boronate ester group. Compounds having trimethyl ammonium salt as a leaving group showed slightly better cross-linking efficiency than those with bromo as a leaving group. Some of these compounds showed a better cross-linking efficiency than that of traditional alkylating agents , such as nitrogen mustard analogues or quinone methide precursors. These highly efficient photo-activated carbocation precursors allow determination and characterization of the adducts formed between the photo-generated naphthalenyl cations and four natural nucleosides , indicating that the alkylation sites for these naphthalene analogues are dG , dA , and dC.
