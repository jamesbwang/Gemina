  The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of nilotinib ( NIL) versus high-dose imatinib ( IM) versus sustained standard-dose IM for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia<disease> ( CML) with suboptimal molecular response to first-line IM therapy. Patients with CML who achieved complete cytogenetic response ( CCyR) but not major molecular response ( MMR) after 18-24 months on first-line IM therapy were enrolled and divided into three treatment cohorts: NIL 800 mg/day ( Cohort 1 , n = 28) and IM 800 mg/day ( Cohort 2 , n = 28) in the RE-NICE study , and sustained IM 400 mg/day ( Cohort 3 , n = 52) in clinical practice. The primary efficacy variable of cumulative rate of MMR by 12 months was not different among the three cohorts. However , the cumulative incidence of MMR by 36 months was significantly higher in Cohort 1 than Cohort 3 ( 83.1 % vs. 57.1 % , P = 0.021) , but there were no significant differences in Cohort 1 vs. 2 ( P = 0.195) and Cohort 2 vs. 3 ( P = 0.297). Different profile for adverse events was observed between NIL and high-dose IM therapy. In conclusion , our data suggested that switching to NIL may provide more effective long-term response than sustaining standard-dose IM for patients with suboptimal molecular response to first-line IM.
