  Acellular pertussis<disease> vaccine studies postulate that waning protection , particularly after the adolescent booster , is a major contributor to the increasing US pertussis<disease> incidence. However , these studies reported relative ( ie , vs a population given prior doses of pertussis<disease> vaccine) , not absolute ( ie , vs a pertussis<disease> vaccine na√Øve population) efficacy following the adolescent booster. We aim to estimate the absolute protection offered by acellular pertussis<disease> vaccines. We conducted a systematic review of acellular pertussis<disease> vaccine effectiveness ( VE) publications. Studies had to comply with the US schedule , evaluate clinical outcomes , and report VE over discrete time points. VE after the 5-dose childhood series and after the adolescent sixth-dose booster were extracted separately and pooled. All relative VE estimates were transformed to absolute estimates. VE waning was estimated using meta-regression modeling. Three studies reported VE after the childhood series and four after the adolescent booster. All booster studies reported relative VE ( vs acellular pertussis<disease> vaccine-primed population). We estimate initial childhood series absolute VE is 91 % ( 95 % CI: 87 % to 95 %) and declines at 9.6 % annually. Initial relative VE after adolescent boosting is 70 % ( 95 % CI: 54 % to 86 %) and declines at 45.3 % annually. Initial absolute VE after adolescent boosting is 85 % ( 95 % CI: 84 % to 86 %) and declines at 11.7 % ( 95 % CI: 11.1 % to 12.3 %) annually. Acellular pertussis<disease> vaccine efficacy is initially high and wanes over time. Observational VE studies of boosting failed to recognize that they were measuring relative , not absolute , VE and the absolute VE in the boosted population is better than appreciated.
