  The aim of this study was to examine differences in students ' physical activity motivation , competence , and weekly exercise metabolic equivalent units ( METs) between universities with different physical activity education ( PAE) policy arrangements ( i.e. , a required PAE vs. an elective PAE). Participants ( N = 953) were purposefully recruited from two universities with different PAE policies 1-week before the start of fall term 2015. Participants completed questionnaires assessing their physical activity motivation , competence , and weekly exercise METs. The results of this study suggest that having a required PAE policy allows for more students with lower self-determined forms of motivation ( i.e. , amotivation) to be reached in comparison to the elective PAE policy. This finding highlights that a primary value of having a required PAE policy is its ability to reach less motivated students.
