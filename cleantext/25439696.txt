  In 2014 , the International Myeloma Working Group reclassified patients with smoldering multiple myeloma ( SMM) and bone marrow-plasma cell percentage ( BMPC %) ≥ 60 % , or serum free light chain ratio ( FLCr) ≥ 100 or > 1 focal lesion<symptom> on magnetic resonance imaging as multiple myeloma ( MM). Predictors of progression in patients currently classified as SMM are not known. We identified 421 patients with SMM , diagnosed between 2003 and 2015. The median time to progression ( TTP) was 57 months ( CI , 45-72). BMPC % > 20 % ( hazard ratio ( HR): 2.28 ( CI , 1.63-3.20); p < 0.0001); M-protein > 2g/dL ( HR: 1.56 ( CI , 1.11-2.20); p = 0.01) , and FLCr > 20 ( HR: 2.13 ( CI , 1.55-2.93); p < 0.0001) independently predicted shorter TTP in multivariate analysis. Age and immunoparesis were not significant. We stratified patients into three groups: low risk ( none of the three risk factors; n = 143); intermediate risk ( one of the three risk factors; n = 121); and high risk ( ≥ 2 of the three risk factors; n = 153). The median TTP for low- , intermediate- , and high-risk groups were 110 , 68 , and 29 months , respectively ( p < 0.0001). BMPC % > 20 % , M-protein > 2 g/dL , and FLCr > 20 at diagnosis can be used to risk stratify patients with SMM. Patients with high-risk SMM need close follow-up and are candidates for clinical trials aiming to prevent progression.
