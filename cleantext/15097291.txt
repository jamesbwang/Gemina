  Treatment outcomes from pallidal deep brain stimulation are highly heterogeneous reflecting the phenotypic and etiologic spectrum of dystonia. Treatment stratification to neurostimulation therapy primarily relies on the phenotypic motor presentation; however , etiology including genetic factors are increasingly recognized as modifiers of treatment outcomes. Here , we describe a 53 year-old female patient with a progressive generalized dystonia since age 25. The patient underwent deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus ( GPi-DBS) at age 44. Since the clinical phenotype included mobile choreo-dystonic features , we expected favorable therapeutic outcome from GPi-DBS. Although mobile dystonia components were slightly improved in the long-term outcome from GPi-DBS the overall therapeutic response 9 years from implantation was limited when comparing `` stimulation off '' and `` stimulation on '' despite of proper electrode localization and sufficient stimulation programming. In order to further understand the reason for this limited motor<symptom> symptom<symptom> response<symptom> , we aimed to clarify the etiology of generalized dystonia in this patient. Genetic testing identified a novel heterozygous pathogenic
