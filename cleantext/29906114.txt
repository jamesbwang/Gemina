  First-generation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) inhibitors , gefitinib and erlotinib , have achieved initially marked clinical efficacy for nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) patients with EGFR activating mutations. However , their clinical benefit was limited by the emergence of acquired resistance mutations. In most cases ( approximately 60 %) , the resistance was caused by the secondary EGFR T790M gatekeeper mutation. Thus , it is still desirable to develop novel third-generation EGFR inhibitors to overcome T790M mutation while sparing wild-type ( WT) EGFR. Herein , a series of pyrimido ( 4,5- d) pyrimidine-2,4 ( 1 H ,3 H)- dione derivatives were designed and synthesized , among which the most potent compound 20g not only demonstrated significant inhibitory activity and selectivity for EGFR
