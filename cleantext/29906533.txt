  The detection of autoantibodies generated against modified proteins that stimulate cellular and humoral immune response has developed a lot of interest in the recent years and a search for biomarkers for the early detection of diseases has increased. IgG protein has earned attention for its possible modifications under hyperglycaemic conditions in rheumatoid arthritis<disease> , wherein dicarbonyl stress has been reported to alter the structural integrity of the protein. This report suggests that the interaction of the methylglyoxal with the IgG has consequences in the autoimmunopathology of rheumatoid arthritis<disease>. Our molecular docking analysis of methylglyoxal and IgG revealed a close interaction between the two molecules. TNBS studies confirmed the interaction by showing a decline in free lysine-arginine content post-MG modifications in IgG. The modified IgG was thermally more stable and showed the generation of glycation adducts N-epsilon-carboxyethyllysine. Rheumatoid arthritis<disease> patients showed enhanced carbonyl stress which was expected to induce structural changes in the epitope makeup of IgG. The ELISA studies and gel retardation assay confirmed auto-antibodies against MG modified IgG ( MG-IgG) pointing towards the generation of neoepitopes upon IgG after interaction with MG. This study establishes the IgG modification in RA patients under alter carbonyl concentrations.
