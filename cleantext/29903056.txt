  Bio-inspired supramolecular self-assembly have been widely explored in biomedical engineering , especially in the field of drug delivery. Here , viral capsid analogue pH-Sensitive polymeric micelles HA-Hyd-DOX were reported , where natural polysacarrides hyaluronic acid ( HA) and anticancer drug doxorubicin ( DOX) , were linked through a hydrazone bond with a high drug loading content of 33.09 wt %. The polymeric micelles look like artificial virus capsids from `` core-shell '' structures. In addition , the polymeric backbone HA and hydrazone bonds were destroyed in the presence of hyaluronidase in cancer cells and under the acidic conditions of pH = 5 respectively , thereby prodrug-based polymeric micelles could penetrate into the tumor and DOX could be released in lysosomes to enhance anticancer efficacy. With the comparison of typical prodrug-based polymeric micelles mPEG-Hyd-DOX system where DOX was linked to methoxy poly ( ethylene glycol) with a hydrazone bond linkage , HA-Hyd-DOX showed greater inhibition to cancer cells due to the better penetration. Such viral capsids mimicking polymeric micelles provided some remarkable benefits for drug delivery , including , high drug loading efficiency , controlled drug release and excellent biodegradable.
