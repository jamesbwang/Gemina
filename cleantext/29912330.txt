  Cell surfaces are critical for diverse functions across all domains of life , from cell-cell communication and nutrient uptake to cell stability and surface attachment. While certain aspects of the mechanisms supporting the biosynthesis of the archaeal cell surface are unique , likely due to important differences in cell surface compositions between domains , others are shared with bacteria or eukaryotes or both. Based on recent studies completed on a phylogenetically diverse array of archaea , from a wide variety of habitats , here we discuss advances in the characterization of mechanisms underpinning archaeal cell surface biogenesis. These include those facilitating co- and post-translational protein targeting to the cell surface , transport into and across the archaeal lipid membrane , and protein anchoring strategies. We also discuss , in some detail , the assembly of specific cell surface structures , such as the archaeal S-layer and the type IV pili. We will highlight the importance of post-translational protein modifications , such as lipid attachment and glycosylation , in the biosynthesis as well as the regulation of the functions of these cell surface structures and present the differences and similarities in the biogenesis of the pili across prokaryotic domains.
