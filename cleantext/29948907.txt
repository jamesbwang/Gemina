  In this work , we propose a novel framework to encode the local connectivity patterns of brain , using Fisher vectors ( FV) , vector of locally aggregated descriptors ( VLAD) and bag-of-words ( BoW) methods. We first obtain local descriptors , called mesh arc descriptors ( MADs) from fMRI data , by forming local meshes around anatomical regions , and estimating their relationship within a neighborhood. Then , we extract a dictionary of relationships , called brain connectivity dictionary by fitting a generative Gaussian mixture model ( GMM) to a set of MADs , and selecting codewords at the mean of each component of the mixture. Codewords represent connectivity patterns among anatomical regions. We also encode MADs by VLAD and BoW methods using k-Means clustering. We classify cognitive tasks using the Human Connectome Project ( HCP) task fMRI dataset and cognitive states using the Emotional Memory Retrieval ( EMR). We train support vector machines ( SVMs) using the encoded MADs. Results demonstrate that , FV encoding of MADs can be successfully employed for classification of cognitive tasks , and outperform VLAD and BoW representations. Moreover , we identify the significant Gaussians in mixture models by computing energy of their corresponding FV parts , and analyze their effect on classification accuracy. Finally , we suggest a new method to visualize the codewords of the learned brain connectivity dictionary.
