  Accidents have happened in the chemical industries all over the world with serious consequences for the adjacent heavily populated areas. In this study , the impact of the probable hypothetical event , releasing considerable amounts of hydrogen fluoride ( HF) as a strong irritant into the atmosphere over the city of Isfahan from a strategic chemical plant , was simulated by computational fluid dynamics ( CFD). In this model , the meteorological parameters were integrated into time and space , and dispersion of the pollutants was estimated based on a probable accidental release of HF. According to the hypothetical results of the simulation model in this study , HF clouds reached Isfahan in 20 min and exposed 80 % of the general public to HF concentration in the range of 0-34 ppm. Then , they dissipated 240 min after the time of the incident. Supposing the uniform population density within the proximity of the city of Isfahan with the population of 1.75 million , 5 % of the population ( 87,500 people) could be exposed for a few minutes to a HF concentration as high as 34 ppm. This concentration is higher than a very hazardous concentration described as the Immediate Danger to Life and Health ( 30 ppm). This hypothetical risk evaluation of environmental exposure to HF with the potential of health risks was very instrumental for the general public of Isfahan in terms of risk management. Similar studies based on probable accidental scenarios along with the application of a simulation model for computation of dispersed pollutants are recommended for risk evaluation and management of cities in the developing countries with a fast pace of urbanization around the industrial sites.
