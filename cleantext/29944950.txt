  The regulation of histone 3 lysine 4 ( H3K4) methylation codeis indispensable for the cell as any disturbance in this has been associated with many pathologic conditions , like cancer. The SET domain-containing lysine methyltransferase 2 ( KMT2) family of histone methyltransferases was the first to be identified as writers of H3K4 methylation. In mammals , seven members of the KMT2 family are responsible for carrying out the bulk of H3K4 methylation. Recent studies documented alterations in various histone methylases in human cancer , which were associated with therapeutic and prognostic potential. Notwithstanding , no report has documented the role of KMT2 family of histone methyltransferases in clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC). Therefore , we examined the expression profile of all the seven KMT2 family members of histone methyltransferases in ccRCC with the aim to establish their role as prognostic or therapeutic targets. Real-time PCR was employed to study the expression of KMT2 family genes using specific primers in 50 cases of ccRCC. The mRNA levels were correlated with stage , grade , and metastasis of the tumor. Among seven genes , KMT2G was significantly up-regulated in higher stages of the tumor as compared to low stage tumors ( p = 0.017). Similarly , KMT2G levels were higher in the metastatic tumor ( p = 0.027). Additionally , some of the KMT2G target genes were found to be up-regulated in metastatic tumors as compared to non-metastasis. ROC curve indicated KMT2G as a good marker for discriminating metastatic tumors from non-metastatic tumors ( AUC = 0.738). Thus , we conclude that KMT2G histone methyltransferase could be a good prognostic marker for ccRCC. Additionally , KMT2G can also serve as a therapeutic target for ccRCC.
