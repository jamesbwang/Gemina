  Maternal immunization is an effective strategy to protect pregnant women and their infants from vaccine-preventable diseases. Despite the recommendation of maternal influenza<disease> and more recently pertussis<disease> immunization in Australia , uptake of these vaccines has been suboptimal. A midwife delivered immunization program for pregnant women at the Women 's and Children 's Hospital in South Australia commenced in April 2015. Monitoring the uptake of the current funded vaccine programs for pregnant women is limited. The study aimed to estimate maternal vaccine uptake and assess factors associated with influenza<disease> and pertussis<disease> vaccine uptake among pregnant women. This prospective study was undertaken between November 2014 and July 2016 at the Women 's and Children 's Hospital. Following consent , demographic details and vaccination history for South Australian pregnant women who attended the antenatal clinic were collected. A standardised self-reported survey was completed during pregnancy with a follow up telephone interview at 8-10 weeks post-delivery. 205 women consented and completed the self-reported survey. Of the 180 pregnant women who completed the study , 76 % and 81 % received maternal influenza<disease> and pertussis<disease> vaccines respectively. The adjusted odds of women receiving maternal vaccines during pregnancy were significantly higher for women delivering after the implementation of the midwife delivered program compared with women who delivered babies prior to the program for both pertussis<disease> vaccination ( AOR 21.17 , 95 % CI 6.14-72.95; p < 0.001) and influenza<disease> vaccination ( AOR 5.95 , 95 % CI 2.13-16.61 , p < 0.001). Women receiving a recommendation from a health care provider and first time mothers were significantly more likely to receive influenza<disease> vaccination during pregnancy. High uptake of influenza<disease> and pertussis<disease> vaccines during pregnancy can be attained with health care provider recommendation and inclusion of maternal immunization as part of standard antenatal care. A midwife delivered maternal immunization program is a promising approach to improve maternal vaccine uptake by pregnant women.
