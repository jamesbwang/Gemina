  Agricultural production must increase to feed a growing and wealthier population , as well as to satisfy increasing demands for biomaterials and biomass-based energy. At the same time , deforestation and land-use change need to be minimized in order to preserve biodiversity and maintain carbon stores in vegetation and soils. Consequently , agricultural land use needs to be intensified in order to increase food production per unit area of land. Here we use simulations of AgMIP 's Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison ( GGCMI) phase 1 to assess implications of input-driven intensification ( water , nutrients) on crop yield and yield stability , which is an important aspect in food security. We find region- and crop-specific responses for the simulated period 1980-2009 with broadly increasing yield variability under additional nitrogen inputs and stabilizing yields under additional water inputs ( irrigation) , reflecting current patterns of water and nutrient limitation. The different models of the GGCMI ensemble show similar response patterns , but model differences warrant further research on management assumptions , such as variety selection and soil management , and inputs as well as on model implementation of different soil and plant processes , such as on heat stress , and parameters. Higher variability in crop productivity under higher fertilizer input will require adequate buffer mechanisms in trade and distribution/storage networks to avoid food price volatility.
