  The development of catalytic , enantioselective halofunctionalizations of unactivated alkenes has made significant progress in recent years. However , the identification of generally applicable catalysts for wide range of substrates has yet to be realized. A detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism is essential to guide the formulation of a truly general catalyst. Herein , we present our investigations on the enantiodetermining step of a Lewis base catalyzed bromocycloetherification that provides important insights and design criteria.
