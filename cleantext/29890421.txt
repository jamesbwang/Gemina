  Perchlorate bioreduction coupled to methane oxidation was successfully achieved without the addition of nitrate or nitrite in a membrane biofilm reactor ( MBfR) inoculated with a mixture of freshwater sediments and anaerobic digester sludge as well as return activated sludge. The reactor was operated at different methane pressures ( 60 , 40 and 20 Kpa) and influent perchlorate concentrations ( 1 , 5 and 10 mg/L) to evaluate the biochemical process of perchlorate bioreduction coupled to methane oxidation. Perchlorate was completely reduced with a higher removal flux of 92.75 mg/m
