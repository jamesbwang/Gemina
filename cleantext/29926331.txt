  Pyrolysis of biodiesel at high temperatures may result in the formation of transient and stable free radicals immobilized on particulate emissions. Consequently , free radicals adsorbed on particulates are believed to be precursors for health-related illnesses such as cancer , cardiac arrest , and oxidative stress. This study explores the nature of free radicals and particulate emissions generated when Croton megalocarpus biodiesel is pyrolyzed at 600 °C in an inert environment of flowing nitrogen at a residence time of 0.5 s at 1 atm. The surface morphology of thermal emissions were imaged using a field emission gun scanning electron microscope ( FEG SEM) while the radical characteristics were investigated using an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer ( EPR). A g-value of 2.0024 associated with a narrow ∆ Hp-p of 3.65 G was determined. The decay rate constant for the radicals was low ( 1.86 × 10
