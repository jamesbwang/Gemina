  Groundwater arsenic contamination has become a serious global concern due to its adverse effects on human health. Arsenic-induced reactive oxygen species trigger oxidative stress inside mitochondria , which initiate a cascade of events including altered mitochondrial ( mt) membrane potential , uncoupling of electron transport chain , and mtDNA damage. A case-control study was conducted to examine the association between arsenic exposure and differences in mtDNA methylation and to assess the downstream consequences. We recruited 221 arsenic-exposed individuals , including 106 individuals with skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> ( WSL) and 115 subjects without any skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> ( WOSL) from the Murshidabad district , West Bengal , India. The unexposed group included 101 individuals from the arsenic unexposed area in East Midnapore. We analyzed the status of mtDNA methylation in D-loop region and ND6 gene by methylation-specific PCR. Gene expression was studied by quantitative real-time PCR. Significant hypomethylation in both D-loop and ND6 was observed with a consequent increase in their target gene expression and higher mtDNA copy number in arsenic-exposed populations compared to controls. Further mechanistic insights regarding mitochondrial epigenetic alteration in arsenic exposure will be of critical importance for the prevention of adverse health effects.
