  The relationship between dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM) has been frequently reported. Lipoprotein lipase ( LPL) is considered to be an effective gene in regulating lipid profile. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. In the present study , we have evaluated rs13702 ( C/T) polymorphism located in miRNA-410 binding site of LPL gene in subset of Iranian T2DM patients and their normal counterparts. In this case-control study , 102 T2DM patients and 98 healthy controls were worked out for rs13702 single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes. High resolution meting ( HRM) analysis was used for genotyping. C allele of rs13702 C/T polymorphism located in miRNA-410 binding site in LPL gene was detected to be significantly associated with T2DM ( C allele; odds ratios ( OR) = 1.729 ( 95 % confidential intervals ( CI) = 1.184-2.523); Correlation of rs13702 C allele with susceptibility to T2DM may be due to the higher level of LPL that leads to increased plasma fatty acids and its entry into peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle , liver , and adipocytes causing development of insulin resistance and ultimately T2DM.
