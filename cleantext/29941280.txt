  Rhabdomyosarcoma is an aggressive tumour that can develop in almost any part of the body. Doxorubicin is an effective drug against rhabdomyosarcoma , but its role in combination with an established multidrug regimen remains controversial. Therefore , we aimed to evaluate the possible benefit of early dose intensification with doxorubicin in patients with non-metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. We did a multicentre , open-label , randomised controlled , phase 3 trial involving 108 hospitals from 14 countries. We included patients older than 6 months but younger than 21 years with a pathologically proven diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. We assigned each patient to a specific subgroup according to the EpSSG stratification system. Those with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma incompletely resected and localised at unfavourable sites with or without nodal involvement , or those with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma without nodal involvement were considered at high risk of relapse. These high-risk patients were randomly assigned ( 1:1) to receive either nine cycles of IVA ( ifosfamide 3 g/m Between Oct 1 , 2005 , and Dec 16 , 2013 , 484 patients were randomly assigned to receive each chemotherapy regimen ( 242 in the IVA group and 242 in the IVA plus doxorubicin group). Median follow-up was 63 · 9 months ( IQR 44 · 6-78 · 9). The 3-year event-free survival was 67 · 5 % ( 95 % CI 61 · 2-73 · 1) in the IVA plus doxorubicin group and 63 · 3 % ( 56 · 8-69 · 0) in the IVA group ( hazard ratio 0 · 87 , 95 % CI 0 · 65-1 · 16; p = 0 · 33). Grade 3-4 leucopenia ( 232 ( 93 %) of 249 patients in the IVA plus doxorubicin group vs 194 ( 85 %) of 227 in the IVA group; p = 0 · 0061) , anaemia ( 195 ( 78 %) vs 111 ( 49 %); p < 0 · 0001) , thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( 168 ( 67 %) vs 59 ( 26 %); p < 0.0001) , and gastrointestinal adverse events ( 78 ( 31 %) vs 19 ( 8 %); p < 0 · 0001) were significantly more common in the IVA plus doxorubicin group than in the IVA group. Grade 3-5 infections ( 198 ( 79 %) vs 128 ( 56 %); p < 0 · 0001) were also significantly more common in the IVA plus doxorubicin group than in the IVA group , in which one patient had grade 5 infection. Two treatment-related deaths were reported ( one patient developed septic shock<symptom> and one affected by Goldenhar syndrome<symptom> developed intractable seizures<symptom>) in the IVA plus doxorubicin group , both occurring after the first cycle of treatment , and none were reported in the IVA group. The addition of dose-intensified doxorubicin to standard IVA chemotherapy did not show a significant improvement in the outcome of patients with high-risk non-metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. Therefore , the IVA chemotherapy regimen should remain the standard of care for patients with localised rhabdomyosarcoma in Europe.
