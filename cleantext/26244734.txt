  Regardless of the progress achieved during recent years , the mechanisms coupling growth and division to attain cell size homeostasis in bacterial populations are still not well understood. In particular , there is a gap of knowledge about the mechanisms controlling anomalous growth events that are ubiquitous even in wild-type phenotypes. Thus , when cells exceed the doubling size the divisome dynamics sets a characteristic length scale that suggests a sizer property. Yet , it has been recently shown that the size at birth and the size increment still satisfy an adder-like correlation. Herein we propose a Markov chain model , that we complement with computational and experimental approaches , to clarify this issue. In this context , we show that classifying cells as a function of the characteristic size set by the divisome dynamics provides a compelling framework to understand size convergence , growth , and division at the large length scale , including the adaptation to , and rescue from , filamentation processes. Our results reveal the independence of size homeostasis on the division pattern of long cells and help to reconcile sizer concepts at the single cell level with an adder-like behavior at a population level.
