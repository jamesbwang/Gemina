  Metabolic dependencies between microbial species have a significant impact on the assembly and activity of microbial communities. However , the evolutionary origins of such dependencies and the impact of metabolic and genomic architecture on their emergence are not clear. To address these questions , we developed a novel framework , coupling a reductive evolution model with a multi-species genome-scale metabolic model to simulate the evolution of two-species microbial communities. Simulating thousands of independent evolutionary trajectories , we surprisingly found that under certain environmental and evolutionary settings metabolic dependencies emerged frequently even though our model does not include explicit selection for cooperation. Evolved dependencies involved cross-feeding of a diverse set of metabolites , reflecting constraints imposed by metabolic network architecture. We additionally found metabolic ` missed opportunities ' , wherein species failed to capitalize on metabolites made available by their partners. Examining the genes deleted in each evolutionary trajectory and the deletion timing further revealed both genome-wide properties and specific metabolic mechanisms associated with species interaction. Our findings provide insight into the evolution of cooperative interaction among microbial species and a unique view into the way such relationships emerge.
