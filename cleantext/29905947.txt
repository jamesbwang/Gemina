  Almond seeds were subjected to select thermal processing and amandin was purified from processed and unprocessed ( control) seeds using cryoprecipitation. Amandin immunoreactivity was assessed using two murine monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs) -4 C10 and 4F10 detecting human IgE-relevant conformational and linear epitopes , respectively. Overall amandin immunoreactivity following thermal treatment ranged from 64.9 % to 277.8 % ( 4C10) and 81.3 % to 270.3 % ( 4F10). Except for autoclaving ( 121 째C , 15 psi , 30 min) and roasting ( 160 째C , 30 min) , the tested processing conditions resulted in increased immunoreactivity as determined by mAbs 4C10 and 4F10-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISAs). A significant , yet not complete , reduction in immunoreactivity was caused by autoclaving ( 121 째C , 15 psi , 30 min) and roasting ( 160 째C , 30 min). Western- and dot-blot immunoassays corroborated the ELISA results , confirming amandin thermal stability. The tested immunoassays indicated amandin to be stable , regardless of the targeted epitope and the processing method that whole almond seeds were subjected to.
