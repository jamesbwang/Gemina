  To determine presenting visual acuity levels and explore the factors associated with failing vision screening in a multi-ethnic population of UK children aged 4-5 years. Visual acuity ( VA) using the logMAR Crowded Test was measured in 16,541 children in a population-based vision screening programme. Referral for cycloplegic examination was based on national recommendations ( > 0.20 logMAR in one or both eyes). Presenting visual impairment ( PVI) was defined as VA > 0.3 logMAR in the better eye. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association of ethnicity , maternal , and early-life factors with failing vision screening and PVI in participants of the Born in Bradford birth cohort. In total , 2467/16 ,541 ( 15 %) failed vision screening , 732 ( 4.4 %) had PVI. Children of Pakistani ( OR: 2.49; 95 % CI: 1.74-3.60) and other ethnicities ( OR: 2.00; 95 % CI: 1.28-3.12) showed increased odds of PVI compared to white children. Children born to older mothers ( OR: 1.63; 95 % CI: 1.19-2.24) and of low<symptom> birth<symptom> weight ( OR: 1.52; 95 % CI: 1.00-2.34) also showed increased odds. Follow-up results were available for 1068 ( 43.3 %) children , 993 ( 93 %) were true positives; 932 ( 94 %) of these had significant refractive error. Astigmatism ( > 1DC) ( 44 %) was more common in children of Pakistani ethnicity and hypermetropia ( > 3.0 DS) ( 27 %) in white children ( Fisher 's exact , p < 0.001). A high prevalence of PVI is reported. Failing vision screening and PVI were highly associated with ethnicity. The positive predictive value of the vision screening programme was good , with only 7 % of children followed up confirmed as false positives.
