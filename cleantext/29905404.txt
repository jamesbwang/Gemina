  Nanometer-wide graphene nanoribbons can be synthesized from halogen aromatics through multistep on-surface reactions , but the catalytic role of extrinsic transition-metal atoms in these reactions are still to be explored. Here by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy , we investigated the on-surface synthesis of graphene nanoribbons from 10,10 '- dibromo-9,9 '- bianthryl precursors in the presence of Ni atoms. Ni atoms not only act as catalysts in debromination and lead to the formation of an organometallic intermediate at 300 K , but also prompt the fusion reaction between graphene nanoribbons at 673 K. Our work demonstrates a more efficient way to fabricate fused graphene nanoribbons.
