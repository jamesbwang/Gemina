  The aim of this study is to validate the efficacy of drug-coated balloons ( DCBs) for real-world de novo small vessel diseases including chronic total occlusion and bifurcation. DCB angioplasty has been reported to be effective in the treatment of de novo small vessel disease. However , the number of reports that have focused on complex lesions<symptom> is limited. This observational study comprised consecutive patients who underwent DCB angioplasty for de novo small vessel disease with a reference diameter of less than 2.5 mm by visual estimation. Outcome parameters included late lumen loss , restenosis rate , and major adverse cardiac events , such as cardiac death , non-fatal myocardial infarction , and target lesion<symptom> revascularization ( TLR). Fifty-two patients underwent DCB angioplasty for 59 lesions<symptom> with a reference vessel diameter of 1.93 ± 0.63 mm. Thirty-eight of the lesions<symptom> ( 69 %) were classified as type B2/C , including chronic total occlusions ( 20 %) and bifurcations ( 33 %). At the 8-month follow-up , late lumen loss was- 0.01 ± 0.44 mm with a restenosis rate of 20 %. No cardiac deaths or myocardial infarctions were reported and only 5 ( 9 %) angiographically driven TLRs were reported. DCB angioplasty offered an acceptable 8-month lumen patency and a stable clinical outcome for real-world complex de novo coronary diseases.
