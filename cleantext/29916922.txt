  I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ( I-MIBG) has been used in the diagnosis and therapy of neuroblastoma in adult and pediatric patients for many years. In this study , we evaluated whole-body I-MIBG clearance and radiation doses received by patients , family caregivers , and medical staff to establish appropriate radiation safety measures to be used in therapy applications. Research was focused on 23 children and adolescents with metastatic neuroblastoma , with ages ranging from 1.8 to 13 years , being treated with I-MIBG. Based on measured external dose rates from patients , dosimetric data to patients , family members , and others were calculated. The mean ± SD I-MIBG activity administered was 8.55 ± 1.69 GBq. Percent whole-body retention rates of I-MIBG at 24 , 48 , and 72 hours after administration were 48 % ± 7 % , 23 % ± 7 % , and 12 % ± 6 % , with a whole-body I-MIBG effective half-life of 23 ± 5 hours for all patients. The mean doses for patients were 0.234 ± 0.096 mGy · MBq to red-marrow and 0.251 ± 0.101 mGy · MBq to whole body. The maximum potential radiation doses transmitted by patients to others at 1.0 m was estimated to be 11.9 ± 3.4 mSv , with 97 % of this dose occurring over 120 hours after therapy administration. Measured mean dose received by the 22 family caregivers was 1.88 ± 1.85 mSv , and that received by the 19 pediatric physicians was 43 ± 51 μSv. In this study , we evaluated the whole-body clearance of I-MIBG in 23 pediatric patients , and the radiation doses received by family caregivers and medical staff during these therapy procedures , thus facilitating the establishment of radiation safety measures to be applied in pediatric therapy.
