  Caudal block is a safe and simple method of pain relief in young children with the drawback of a short duration of analgesia which can be overcome by adding various adjuvants to the injected local anaesthetic. We compared the effects of caudal levobupivacaine , tramadol and a combination of both in paediatric patients undergoing inguinal herniotomy. A total of 78 children aged 1-7 years , planned for inguinal herniotomy were randomly allocated into three groups. Group L received levobupivacaine 0.125 % 1 ml/kg , Group T received tramadol 1.5 mg/kg in 0.9 % NS and Group LT 1 ml/kg of 0.125 % levobupivacaine with 1.5 mg/kg tramadol caudally. The primary outcome was the duration of analgesia. Rescue analgesic doses required , the duration of motor blockade and adverse effects were recorded for 12 h post-operatively. Data was analysed by analysis of variance test , Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-square tests. All groups were comparable with regard to age , sex and duration of surgery. No motor block was observed in any of the patients. The mean duration of analgesia in Group L was 321.46 ± 84.76 min , in Group T was 565.19 ± 107.08 min , and in Group LT was 720 min ( Addition of tramadol to caudal levobupivacaine significantly increased the duration of postoperative analgesia.
