  Nonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia ( NICTH) is a rare but serious paraneoplastic syndrome<disease> associated with large tumors. The high molecular weight IGF2 , known as `` big '' IGF2 , is produced by culprit tumors and leads to severe hypoglycemia. The detailed mechanism of its production in NICTH , however , remains unclear. To clarify the mechanism of production of big IGF2 in light of the processing of pro-IGF2 in patients with solitary fibrous tumor ( SFT) and NICTH. We enrolled 14 patients with SFT and divided them based on the presence or absence of hypoglycemia. In light of the processing of pro-IGF2 in SFT with hypoglycemia , we , retrospectively , compared the production levels of big IGF2 and the expression levels of IGF2 and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 4 ( PCSK4) , a proteolytic enzyme of pro-IGF2. In all patients with NICTH , big IGF2 was detected in serum by western immunoblotting analysis. Moreover , we showed that two patients without hypoglycemia also had a small amount of big IGF2 in their serum. By immunohistochemical analysis , the protein expression level of IGF2 was significantly higher in the NICTH group than in the non-NICTH group ( P = 0.043). The IGF2/PCSK4 protein expression-level ratio in the NICTH group was significantly higher than that in the non-NICTH group ( P = 0.021). In patients with SFT and hypoglycemia , an imbalance of IGF2 and PCSK4 expression could lead to increased serum levels of big IGF2.
