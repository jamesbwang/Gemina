  Nonketotic hyperglycinemia ( NKH) is an autosomal recessive severe life-threatening catostrophic metabolic disorder. The present study was conducted in a tertiary reference center in Turkey for six years period. The accurate diagnosis of six NKH patients was based on clinical history of the patients , neurological examinations , seizure<symptom> semiology , serial electroencephalography ( EEG) recordings , neuroimaging findings , metabolic tests and genetic analysis. The common clinical findings were hypotonia with severe head lag , poor<symptom> feeding<symptom> , poor<symptom> sucking<symptom> , and intractable seizures<symptom>. The starting age of the symptoms was between birth and 45 days of age ( median: 8 days). The starting age of the seizures<symptom> was between 30 min of age and 45 days of age ( median: 18 days). The age of accurate diagnosis was between 1 month of age and 5.5 months of age ( mean: 3.75 Â± 1.69 months). The cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) to plasma GLY ratio of the patients was between 0.031 and 0.21 ( median: 0.16). The EEG patterns of the patients were suppression-burst , hypsarrhythmia , multifocal epileptic activity , and right centro-occipital epileptic activity on admission. The neuroimaging findings were diffuse hypomyelination , corpus callosum ( CC) hypoplasia , CC agenesis and brainstem hypoplasia on the magnetic resonance imaging and glycine peak was evidenced on magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Four of the patients were mutation-positive. If a child is encephalopathic and/or hypotonic with severe head lag , early evaluation of the EEG records should be made even without a history of clinical seizures<symptom>. The disease has a heterogenous course and the clinical outcome depends on the mutation type.
