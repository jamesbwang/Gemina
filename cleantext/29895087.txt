  We have evaluated the LDH inhibitory property of novel pyrazolo ( 4 ' ,3 ': 5,6) ( 1,4) oxathiino ( 2,3-b) pyrazine derivatives which have been synthesized from easily available starting materials through a one-pot protocol that offers the use of elemental sulfur as the sulfur source. These newly synthesized compounds may aid to drug development for neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases characterized by increased glucose metabolism. Additionally , they may act as suitable starting materials which can be further structurally modified for the development of new LDH inhibitors with higher efficacy and specificity.
