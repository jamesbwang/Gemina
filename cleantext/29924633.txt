  Shoulder stiffness is a common complication after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. However , there is no consensus on the treatment of stiffness after repair. Although one treatment option is an intra-articular steroid injection , it may negatively affect repair integrity , and there is a paucity of literature regarding the timing of intra-articular injections for stiffness after repair and its effect on repair integrity. To compare repair integrity and clinical outcomes after an intra-articular steroid injection administered at 6 weeks and 12 weeks postoperatively for shoulder stiffness after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Cohort study; Level of evidence , 3. Patients who developed stiffness after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were given a series of 3 intra-articular steroid injections every 4 weeks from 6 ( 6-week group) and 12 weeks ( 12-week group) postoperatively. The control group had rotator cuff tears but neither stiffness nor injections. Shoulder range of motion ( ROM) , the Korean Shoulder Scoring System ( KSS) score , and the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA) shoulder score were assessed preoperatively with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Repair integrity was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months postoperatively. Seventy-four of 209 patients ( 35.4 %) who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair developed stiffness. There were no significant differences in retear rates among the 6-week ( 5.7 % , 2/35 patients) , 12-week ( 10.3 % , 4/39 patients) , and control groups ( 14.1 % , 19/135 patients) ( P = .374). Both the 6- and 12-week groups showed significant improvement in ROM ( both P < .001) , KSS scores ( both P < .001) , and UCLA scores ( both P < .001) at the final follow-up. The 6-week group showed significantly better ROM ( P < .001) , KSS scores ( P < .001) , and UCLA scores ( P < .001) than the 12-week group at 3 months postoperatively. However , both the 6- and 12-week groups showed significantly lower KSS ( 81.3 ± 12.0 ( P = .004) and 83.4 ± 8.6 ( P = .035) , respectively) and UCLA ( 29.3 ± 4.6 ( P = .006) and 30.0 ± 3.3 ( P = .042) , respectively) scores than the control group ( 90.4 ± 13.6 and 32.3 ± 4.7 , respectively) at the last follow-up. An intra-articular steroid injection administered at 6 weeks postoperatively for shoulder stiffness after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair may be effective for reducing patients ' pain and improving shoulder ROM at 3 months postoperatively without compromising repair integrity.
