  Intimate partner violence has been related to breastfeeding difficulties. Few studies , however , have also accounted for other biopsychosocial risk factors associated with women 's breastfeeding. Research aim: This study aimed to examine how prenatal intimate partner violence affects women 's breastfeeding initiation , early cessation , and exclusivity at 6 weeks postpartum , controlling for perinatal health problems , prenatal depression<symptom> , childhood adverse experiences , and prenatal breastfeeding education. A longitudinal , prospective one-group study was conducted. Data were collected via interview and survey from a sample of low-income pregnant women ( N = 101) during pregnancy and at 6 weeks postpartum. The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System was used to assess breastfeeding behaviors , prenatal breastfeeding education , and perinatal health problems. Intimate partner violence was assessed using the Conflict Tactics Scales-Revised; adverse childhood experiences and depression<symptom> were assessed using the Adverse Childhood Experiences and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale , respectively. Women 's breastfeeding initiation was predicted by prenatal breastfeeding education ( adjusted odds ratio ( OR) = 3.21 , p < .05). Early breastfeeding cessation was predicted by prenatal exposure to intimate partner violence ( adjusted OR = 0.22 , p < .05) , preterm labor ( adjusted OR = 0.33 , p < .05) , and prenatal breastfeeding education ( adjusted OR = 1.80 , p < .05). These findings highlight the importance of addressing biopsychosocial risk factors , particularly adversity and perinatal health , in efforts to promote women 's breastfeeding success. Future research should evaluate mechanisms that may explain the link between intimate partner violence and breastfeeding cessation.
