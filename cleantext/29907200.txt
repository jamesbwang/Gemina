  Patients who undergo an emergency procedure have an increase in postoperative morbidity and mortality. Emergency procedures constitute 14.2 % of all general surgery procedures and account for 53.5 % of deaths. Among this population , time to surgery from arrival to the emergency department ( ED) has not been evaluated as an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Patients who underwent an emergency general surgery procedure from 2013 to 2015 were identified using a local American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project ( ACS-NSQIP) database. Outcomes of interest included 30-d mortality , all morbidity , and severe morbidity. Multivariate analyses were conducted using a logistic regression model using clinically relevant covariates to determine predictors of the outcome measures. A total of 974 patients were included in the final analysis. The prolonged median time from ED presentation to OR was predictive of all morbidity ( 14.3 h versus 13.3 h , P = 0.009) and severe morbidity ( 13.3 h versus 14.4 h , P = 0.063) on univariate analysis. Time from ED presentation to OR was not predictive of mortality ( 13.5 h versus 13.6 h , P = 0.474). Multivariate analysis demonstrated an adjusted increased odd of morbidity of 2.3 ( 95 % CI: 1.01-5.24) for priority level A cases within the fourth quartile compared to that of the first quartile of time ( P = 0.048). This study corroborates with known data that morbidity and mortality increases in patients who are older , have multiple comorbidities , and higher ASA class. Furthermore , the time from ED arrival to the OR is associated with an overall increase in morbidity.
