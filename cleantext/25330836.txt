  Although there are available therapies as surgery , chemotherapy and radiation , glioblastoma ( GBM) still has been considered as the most common and overwhelming primary tumor of brain. In GBM , the brain glioma stem cells ( BGSCs) were identified and played a crucial role in resistance of GBM to conventional therapies described above. PAX3 was previously identified by our group as a diagnostic/prognostic marker and a therapeutic regulator in the therapy of GBM. Here , we hypothesized PAX3/p53 axis promoted the process of differentiation , regulating to the cancer stem cell properties , such as proliferation and migration. The correlation between PAX3 and p53 in GBM were first clarified. Immunofluorescence of p53 was shown activated following BGSCs differentiation. We further identified that PAX3 might specifically bind to the promoter of p53 gene , and transcriptionally repressed p53 expression. ChIP assay further confirmed that PAX3/p53 axis regulated the differentiation process of BGSCs. Then , the function of PAX3 in BGSCs were sequentially investigated
