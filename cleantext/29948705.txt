  The aim of this study was to identify algicidal bacteria J25 against the Microcystis aeruginosa<pathogen> ( 90.14 %) , Chlorella ( 78.75 %) , Scenedesmus ( not inhibited) , and Oscillatoria ( 90.12 %). Meanwhile , we evaluate the SOD activity and efficiency of denitrification characteristics with Acinetobacter<pathogen> sp.. J25. A novel hybrid bioreactor combined biological floating bed with bio-contact oxidation ( BFBO) was designed for treating the landscape water , and the average removal efficiencies of nitrate-N , ammonia-N , nitrite-N , TN , TP , TOC , and algal cells were 91.14 , 50 , 87.86 , 88.83 , 33.07 , 53.95 , and 53.43 % , respectively. A 454-pyrosequencing technology was employed to investigate the microbial communities of the BFBO reactor samples. The results showed that Acinetobacter<pathogen> sp.. J25 was the dominant contributor for effective removal of N , algal cells , and TOC in the BFBO reactor. And the relative abundance of Acinetobacter<pathogen> showed increase trend with the delay of reaction time. Graphical abstract Biological floating bed and bio-contact oxidation ( BFBO) as a novel hybrid bioreactor designed for simultaneous removal Microcystis aeruginosa<pathogen> , TOC , nitrogen , and phosphorus. And high-throughput sequencing data demonstrated that Acinetobacter<pathogen> sp.. J25 was the dominate species in the reactor and played key roles in the removal of N , TOC , and M. aeruginosa. Proposed reaction mechanism of the BFBO.
