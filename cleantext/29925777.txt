  This study investigates the superiority of cooperative broadcast transmission over traditional orthogonal schemes when applied in a downlink relaying broadcast channel ( RBC). Two proposed cooperative broadcast transmission protocols , one with an amplify-and-forward ( AF) relay , and the other with a repetition-based decode-and-forward ( DF) relay , are investigated. By utilizing superposition coding ( SupC) , the source and the relay transmit the private user messages simultaneously instead of sequentially as in traditional orthogonal schemes , which means the channel resources are reused and an increased channel degree of freedom is available to each user , hence the half-duplex penalty of relaying is alleviated. To facilitate a performance evaluation , theoretical outage probability expressions of the two broadcast transmission schemes are developed , based on which , we investigate the minimum total power consumption of each scheme for a given traffic requirement by numerical simulation. The results provide details on the overall system performance and fruitful insights on the essential characteristics of cooperative broadcast transmission in RBCs. It is observed that better overall outage performances and considerable power gains can be obtained by utilizing cooperative broadcast transmissions compared to traditional orthogonal schemes.
