  It is necessary to study the rugby tackle as it is associated with successful performance outcomes and is responsible for the majority of contact injuries. A novel collision sport simulator was developed to study tackle performance. The main aim of this validation study was to assess tackle technique performance between two different conditions: simulator versus a standardised one-on-one tackle drill previously used to assess technique. Tackling proficiency was assessed using a list of technical criteria. Mean scores , standard deviations and Cohen 's d effect sizes were calculated. Mean overall score for dynamic i.e. running simulator tackles was 7.78 ( 95 % CI 7.58-7.99) ( out of 9) or 87 % ( standard deviation or SD ± 8.94) , and mean overall score for dynamic `` live '' tackles was 7.85 ( 95 % CI 7.57-8.13) ( out of 9) or 87 % ( SD ± 9.60) ( effect size = 0.08; trivial; p > 0.05). Mean overall score for static i.e. standing simulator tackles was 7.45 ( 95 % CI 7.20-7.69) ( out of 9) or 83 % ( SD ± 10.71) , and mean overall score for static `` live '' tackles was 8.05 ( 95 % CI 7.83-8.27) ( out of 9) or 89 % ( SD ± 7.53) ( effect size = 0.72; moderate; p < 0.001). The simulator replicates dynamic tackle technique comparable to real-life tackle drills. It may be used for research analysing various aspects of the tackle in rugby and other contact sports.
