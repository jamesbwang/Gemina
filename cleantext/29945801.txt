  To compare clinical outcomes of ultrathin Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty ( UT-DSAEK) and Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty ( DMEK) in the treatment of corneal endothelial dysfunction. Patient and outcome-masked , randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients with damaged or diseased endothelium from Fuchs endothelial dystrophy or pseudophakic bullous keratopathy who were considered good candidates for DMEK or UT-DSAEK. Study eyes were randomized by the eye bank to UT-DSAEK or DMEK 1 to 2 days before surgery. The primary outcome of the trial was best spectacle-corrected visual acuity ( BSCVA) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included 3- and 12-month BSCVA; 3- , 6- , and 12-month endothelial cell counts; intraoperative and postoperative complications; and change in pachymetry. A total of 216 patients with endothelial dysfunction were screened , and 50 eyes of 38 patients were enrolled by 2 surgeons at Casey Eye Institute at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland , Oregon , and at Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University in Palo Alto , California. Overall , we found DMEK to have better visual acuity outcomes compared with UT-DSAEK after correcting for baseline visual acuity: compared with UT-DSAEK , those randomized to DMEK had 1.5 lines better BSCVA at 3 months ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 2.5-0.6 lines better; P = 0.002) , 1.8 lines better BSCVA at 6 months ( 95 % CI , 2.8-1.0 lines better; P < 0.001) , and 1.4 lines better BSCVA at 12 months ( 95 % CI , 2.2-0.7 lines better; P < 0.001). Average endothelial cell counts were 1963 cells/mm Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty had superior visual acuity results compared with UT-DSAEK at 3 , 6 , and 12 months in patients with isolated endothelial dysfunction with similar complication rates.
