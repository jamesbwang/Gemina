  The nutritional composition of bran from four rice varieties namely , Jyothi/IR64 , Basmati and Agonibora representing high amylose , intermediate amylose and waxy , respectively were evaluated with friction and abrasive mills at different degrees of milling ( DOM). Fat and protein content of the bran inversely correlated to amylose content of rice variety. The fat and fibre contents reduced with increased DOM due to increasing starch influx from the endosperm. Abrasive milling produced bran with higher protein content and total dietary fibre , resulting in superior quality bran , while friction milling led to higher fat. Agonibora bran was found to be superior in terms of nutritional quality. Industrial milling resulted in higher protein content in bran , and Jyothi variety had a better amino acid profile.
