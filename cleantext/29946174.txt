  Chronic<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom> develops in 11-20 % of patients undergoing abdominal surgery , partly owing to post-operative adhesions. In this study we evaluate results of a novel diagnostic and therapeutic approach for pain associated with adhesions. Prospective cohort study including patients with a history of abdominal surgery referred to the outpatient clinic of a tertiary referral center for the evaluation of chronic<symptom> abdominal<symptom> pain<symptom>. Subgroups were made based on outcome of adhesion mapping with cine-MRI and shared decision making. In operatively managed cases , anti-adhesion barriers were applied after adhesiolysis. Long-term results for pain were evaluated by a questionnaire. A total of 106 patients were recruited. Seventy-nine patients had adhesions on cine-MRI , 45 of whom underwent an operation. Response rate to follow-up questionnaire was 86.8 %. In the operative group ( Group 1) , the number of negative laparoscopies was 3 ( 6 %). After a median of 19 ( range 6-47) months follow-up , 80.0 % of patients in group 1 reported improvement of pain , compared with 42.9 % in patients with adhesions on cine-MRI who declined surgery ( group 2) , and 26.3 % in patients with no adhesions on cine-MRI ( group 3) , P = 0.002. Consultation of medical specialists was significantly lower in group 1 compared with groups 2 and 3 ( 35.7 vs. 65.2 vs. 58.8 %; P = 0.023). We demonstrate long-term pain relief in two-thirds of patients with chronic<symptom> pain<symptom> likely caused by adhesions , using cine-MRI and a shared decision-making process. Long-term improvement of pain was achieved in 80 % of patients who underwent surgery with concurrent application of an anti-adhesion barrier.
