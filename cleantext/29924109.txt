  The half-sandwich complex ( Cp ` Fe ( μ-I)) 2 ( 1; Cp ' = η5-1,2,4- ( Me3C) 3C5H2) is cleaved when heated in toluene to form a cation-anion pair ( ( Cp ` Fe ( η6-toluene)) + ( Cp ` FeI2)-) ( 2) , in which the two Fe ( ii) atoms adopt different spin states , i.e. , a low-spin ( S = 0) and a high-spin ( S = 2) configuration. Upon oxidation of 1 with C2H4I2 , the thermally stable 15VE species ( Cp ` FeI2) ( 3) can be isolated , in which the Fe ( iii) atom adopts an intermediate spin ( S = 3/2) configuration. Complex 3 is an excellent starting material for further functionalizations and it reacts with Mg ( CH2SiMe3) 2 to form the unprecedented Fe ( iii) ( S = 3/2) bis ( alkyl) complex<pathogen> ( Cp ` Fe ( CH2SiMe3) 2) ( 4). The respective spin states of complexes 2-4 are confirmed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography , zero-field 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy , and solid-state magnetic susceptibility measurements. In contrast to the related 14VE high-spin ( S = 2) Fe ( ii) alkyl species ( Cp ` FeCH ( SiMe3) 2) , which resists the reaction with H2 as a consequence of a spin-induced reaction barrier , complex 4 reacts cleanly with H2 ( 8 bar) in cyclohexane to yield iron hydrides ( ( Cp ` Fe) 2 ( μ-H) 3) ( 5) and ( Cp ` Fe ( μ-H) 2) 2 ( 6) in a 1: 4 ratio. However , when the hydrogenation of 4 is carried out in benzene , a green 19VE ( Cp ` Fe ( η6-C6H6)) ( A) intermediate is formed , which dimerizes to the bis ( cyclohexadienyl)- bridged product ( ( Cp ` Fe) 2 ( μ2-η5: η5-C12H12)) ( 7). Further evidence for the intermediacy of ( Cp ` Fe ( η6-C6H6)) ( A) was gathered by X-band EPR and UV/vis spectroscopy. Interestingly , attempts to oxidize 7 with AgSbF6 proceeded via C-C bond cleavage instead of metal oxidation to form ( Cp ` Fe ( C6H6)) ( SbF6) ( 8).
