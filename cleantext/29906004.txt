  Cutaneous signs can be the first manifestation of important medical diagnoses , including inherited cancer syndromes<disease> , but access to dermatologic evaluation is especially challenging for uninsured patients. Herein , we present a case in which a volunteer academic teledermatology triage program was used by a community health clinic to make a diagnosis of multiple cutaneous leiomyomas , which confer a high likelihood of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome<disease> , also known as Reed syndrome<disease>; this prompted malignancy screening for the patient. Importantly , this case underscores the potential for teledermatology to improve access to dermatologist evaluation and make crucial diagnoses in patients with barriers to care.
