  Successful execution of goal-directed behaviors often requires the deployment of cognitive control , which is thought to require cognitive effort. Recent theories have proposed that anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC) regulates control levels by weighing the reward-related benefits of control against its effort-related costs. However , given that the sensations of cognitive effort and reward valuation are available only to introspection , this hypothesis is difficult to investigate empirically. We have proposed that two electrophysiological indices of ACC function , frontal midline theta and the reward positivity ( RewP) , provide objective measures of these functions. To explore this issue , we recorded the electroencephalogram ( EEG) from participants engaged in an extended , cognitively-demanding task. Participants performed a time estimation task for 2 h in which they received reward and error feedback according to their task performance. We observed that the amplitude of the RewP , a feedback-locked component of the event related brain potential associated with reward processing , decreased with time-on-task. Conversely , frontal midline theta power , which consists of 4-8 Hz EEG oscillations associated with cognitive effort , increased with time-on-task. We also explored how these phenomena changed over time by conducting within-participant multi-level modeling analyses. Our results suggest that extended execution of a cognitively-demanding task is characterized by an early phase in which high control levels foster rapid improvements in task performance , and a later phase in which high control levels were necessary to maintain stable task performance , perhaps counteracting waning reward valuation.
