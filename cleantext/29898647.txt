  We describe the cases of 2 patients who had septic thrombophlebitis and were successfully managed with endovascular thrombectomy. Patient A developed septic thrombophlebitis of the inferior vena cava after several retroperitoneal resections for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The thrombus was successfully removed via endovascular mechanical balloon thrombectomy. Patient B was a patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma involving the portal vein who developed a septic inferior vena cava thrombus extending from the level and beyond the renal veins , for which she underwent endovascular thrombectomy. We argue that this approach is safe and feasible. It should be considered as a supplemental treatment modality for select decompensating patients who require lifesaving interventions and have contraindications to traditional management of surgical thrombectomy or excision of the involved venous segment.
