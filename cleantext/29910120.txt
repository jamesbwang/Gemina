  Cognitive remediation therapy ( CRT) has shown significant improvement in cognition in schizophrenia. However , effect sizes of CRT have been reported to be modest raising the issue how to augment the effects of CRT on neurocognition and social cognition. Our aim was to examine whether the addition of computerized social cognition training would enhance the effects on neurocognition and social cognition as compared to CRT alone. This is a 12-week , parallel group trial of 131 in- and out-patients with schizophrenia randomized to CRT ( COGPACK or Brain Fitness) with computerized social cognition training ( MRIGE) , or CRT alone for 36 sessions. Participants were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Assessments included neurocognition , social cognition , psychopathology , and functioning. The combined intervention , CRT + MRIGE , showed greater improvements in the MCCB indices of Visual Learning , Working Memory , Reasoning and Problem-Solving , and the neurocognitive composite score compared to CRT alone ( Bonferroni adjusted p = 0.004 , p = 0.005 , p = 0.01 , respectively) , as did social cognition measures ( Bonferroni adjusted p = 0.006 , p = 0.005 , respectively). Supplementing CRT with computerized social cognition training produced greater benefits in neurocognition , including visual learning , memory , executive functions , and social cognition relative to cognitive training alone. These findings favoring the combined training may be contributed to both the greater overall amount of cognitive practice , as well as the specific cognitive functions engaged by the social cognition training.
