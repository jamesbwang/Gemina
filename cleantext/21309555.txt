  Giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs) are a well-established tool for the study of membrane biophysics and are increasingly used as artificial cell models and functional units in biotechnology. This trend is driven by the development of emulsion-based generation methods such as Emulsion Phase Transfer ( EPT) , which facilitates the encapsulation of almost any water-soluble compounds ( including biomolecules) regardless of size or charge , is compatible with droplet microfluidics , and allows GUVs with asymmetric bilayers to be assembled. However , the ability to control the composition of membranes<symptom> formed
