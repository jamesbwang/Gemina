  Regulatory B cells ( Bregs) participate in auto-tolerance maintenance and immune homeostasis. Despite their impact on many diseases and due to the difficulty to define them , knowledge about their origin and their physiological inducers is still unclear. The incomplete understanding about the generation of Bregs and their limited numbers in periphery make it difficult to develop Breg-based therapy. Therefore , identifying factors that promote their development would allow their ex-vivo production in order to create new immunotherapy. This project aims to test the capacity of several cytokines ( Interleukin 1-beta ( IL-1 & beta ;-RRB- , Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF) , and Cluster of differentiation 40 ligand ( CD40L)) and bacteria-derived oligodeoxynucleotides ( CpG-ODN) , alone or in combination , to generate B cells with regulatory phenotype and function. We have demonstrated that the Breg-associated phenotypes were heterogeneous between one and other stimulation conditions. However , the expression of other markers related to Bregs such as IL-10 , CD80 , CD86 , CD71 , Programmed cell death-1 ( PD-1) , and Programmed death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1) was increased when cells were stimulated with CpG alone or in combination. Moreover , stimulated B cells presented a suppressive function on autologous activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC) proliferation. Therefore , this work is the first step to demonstrate the feasibility to induce functional Breg-like cells in vitro and will then facilitate the way to produce Breg-like cells as a potential future cellular therapy.
