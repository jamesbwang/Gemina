  Closed temporal bone fractures due to cranial trauma often result in facial nerve injury , frequently inducing incomplete facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom>. Conventional hypoglossal-facial nerve end-to-end neurorrhaphy may not be suitable for these injuries because sacrifice of the lesioned facial nerve for neurorrhaphy destroys the remnant axons and/or potential spontaneous innervation. we modified the classical method by hypoglossal-facial nerve `` side-to-side '' neurorrhaphy using an interpositional predegenerated nerve graft to treat these injuries. Five patients who experienced facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom> resulting from closed temporal bone fractures due to cranial trauma were treated with the `` side-to-side '' neurorrhaphy. An additional 4 patients did not receive the neurorrhaphy and served as controls. Before treatment , all patients had suffered House-Brackmann ( H-B) grade V or VI facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom> for a mean of 5 months. During the 12-30 months of follow-up period , no further detectable deficits were observed , but an improvement in facial nerve function was evidenced over time in the 5 neurorrhaphy-treated patients. At the end of follow-up , the improved facial function reached H-B grade II in 3 , grade III in 1 and grade IV in 1 of the 5 patients , consistent with the electrophysiological examinations. In the control group , two patients showed slightly spontaneous innervation with facial function improved from H-B grade VI to V , and the other patients remained unchanged at H-B grade V or VI. We concluded that the hypoglossal-facial nerve `` side-to-side '' neurorrhaphy can preserve the injured facial nerve and is suitable for treating significant incomplete facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom> resulting from closed temporal bone fractures , providing an evident beneficial effect. Moreover , this treatment may be performed earlier after the onset of facial<symptom> paralysis<symptom> in order to reduce the unfavorable changes to the injured facial nerve and atrophy of its target muscles due to long-term denervation and allow axonal regrowth in a rich supportive environment.
