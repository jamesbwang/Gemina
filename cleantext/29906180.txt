  We report on a systematic study of nanomechanical dissipation in high-frequency ( â‰ˆ 300 MHz) gallium arsenide optomechanical disk resonators , in conditions where clamping and fluidic losses are negligible. Phonon-phonon interactions are shown to contribute with a loss background fading away at cryogenic temperatures ( 3 K). Atomic layer deposition of alumina at the surface modifies the quality factor of resonators , pointing towards the importance of surface dissipation. The temperature evolution is accurately fitted by two-level systems models , showing that nanomechanical dissipation in gallium arsenide resonators directly connects to their microscopic properties. Two-level systems , notably at surfaces , appear to rule the damping and fluctuations of such high-quality crystalline nanomechanical devices , at all temperatures from 3 to 300 K.
