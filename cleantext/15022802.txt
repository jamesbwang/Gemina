  This study aimed to investigate drain use in a controlled population of patients with hip osteoarthritis undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty. This prospective controlled trial evaluated 93 patients randomized into two groups: a group that received drains and a group that did not. The patients who were randomized to the drain group used a 3.2 mm drain placed under the fascia that was kept in place for 24 h. Postoperative evaluations were performed after 24 h and then three , six , and 12 weeks after total hip arthroplasty. The primary outcome was perioperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> in both groups 24 h after total hip arthroplasty. The other parameters that were evaluated included mid-thigh circumference , the rate of blood transfusion , hematocrit , inflammatory serum levels , and the Harris Hip Score. The clinical and laboratory data revealed no differences between the study groups with respect to blood<symptom> loss<symptom> and need for blood transfusion , duration of hospital stay , reoperation rate , complications , inflammatory serum markers , and the Harris Hip Score. Patients without closed suction drainage reported higher pain levels after 24 h ( VAS score 1 vs. 2 , Similar clinical and laboratory outcomes were found in both cohorts.
