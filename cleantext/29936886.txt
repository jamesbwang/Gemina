  The prices that insurers pay physicians ultimately affect beneficiaries ' health insurance premiums. Using 2014 claims data from three major insurers , we analyzed the prices insurers paid in their Medicare Advantage ( MA) and commercial plans for 20 physician services , in and out of network , and compared those prices with estimated amounts that Medicare 's fee-for-service ( FFS) program would pay for the same service. MA prices paid by those insurers were close to Medicare FFS prices , varied minimally , and were similar in and out of network. In contrast , commercial prices paid by the same insurers were substantially higher than FFS , varied widely , and were up to three times higher out of network than in network. Those results suggest that insurers can use statutory limits on out-of-network charges in MA to negotiate lower in-network prices in those plans. In contrast , without those limits on out-of-network prices , in-network prices in commercial plans are much higher.
