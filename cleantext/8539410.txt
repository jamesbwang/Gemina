  SASI ( selective arterial secretin injection) is a form of ASVS ( arterial stimulation and venous sampling) used to localize pancreatic gastrinomas. This report aims to review the protocol for SASI and demonstrate its utility in localizing functional and nonfunctional gastrinomas. Even if a patient has a pancreatic mass and a laboratory profile fitting a specific endocrine syndrome<disease> , these may or may not be associated as has been previously demonstrated with adrenal vein sampling. We present a case where a patient underwent simultaneous SASI and bland embolization of a hepatic metastasis to facilitate partial pancreatectomy for Zollinger-Ellison
