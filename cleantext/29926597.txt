  To investigate the lipid metabolic effect and mechanism of water extract of lotus leaves ( Traditional Chinese Medicine). Isolated SD rat lipid tissues were suspended in organ baths containing Krebs solution , and the effect of lotus leaf water extract on free fatty acids ( FFA) release was observed; The experimental obesity rat model was established by feeding them high glucose and fat diets , then the changes of body<symptom> weight and blood lipid were measured in the model rats after intragastric administration with water extract of lotus leaves for four weeks , and the expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPAR-γ) and leptin were examined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical. The ex vivo experiment showed that water extract of lotus leaves effectively promoted the FFA release from isolated lipid tissues. In vivo experiment , similarly to Orlistat , water extract of lotus leaves ( 60 mg/kg) markedly decreased the body<symptom> weight and blood lipid of experimental obesity rats ( Water extract of lotus leaves greatly improves the expression of PPAR-γ and leptin , which can promote the lipid mobilization and dissolution , reduce the body<symptom> weight and blood lipid of adult rats with experimental obesity , therefore is expected to be developed into lipid-lowering diet pills.
