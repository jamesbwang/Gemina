  Medial vascular calcification , associated with enhanced mortality in chronic kidney disease ( CKD) , is fostered by osteo-/ chondrogenic transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs). Here , we describe that serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 ( SGK1) was upregulated in VSMCs under calcifying conditions. In primary human aortic VSMCs , overexpression of constitutively active SGK1S422D , but not inactive SGK1K127N , upregulated osteo-/ chondrogenic marker expression and activity , effects pointing to increased osteo-/ chondrogenic transdifferentiation. SGK1S422D induced nuclear translocation and increased transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Silencing or pharmacological inhibition of IKK abrogated the osteoinductive effects of SGK1S422D. Genetic deficiency , silencing , and pharmacological inhibition of SGK1 dissipated phosphate-induced calcification and osteo-/ chondrogenic transdifferentiation of VSMCs. Aortic calcification , stiffness , and osteo-/ chondrogenic transdifferentiation in mice following cholecalciferol overload were strongly reduced by genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition of Sgk1 by EMD638683. Similarly , Sgk1 deficiency blunted vascular calcification in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice after subtotal nephrectomy. Treatment of human aortic smooth muscle cells with serum from uremic patients induced osteo-/ chondrogenic transdifferentiation , effects ameliorated by EMD638683. These observations identified SGK1 as a key regulator of vascular calcification. SGK1 promoted vascular calcification , at least partly , via NF-κB activation. Inhibition of SGK1 may , thus , reduce the burden of vascular calcification in CKD.
