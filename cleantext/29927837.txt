  Scapho-lunate ligament injuries are highly challenging injuries to treat. Great uncertainly remains in determining which operative procedures are most effective. Furthermore , there is no consensus on whether surgical intervention changes the natural course of SL injuries. We present our assessment of SL injuries and the senior author 's preferred surgical techniques. Surgical videos are included. Operative procedures are selected based on the patient 's timing and pattern of injury , degree of associated carpal changes and arthritis<disease> , and goals. Our post-operative management is described. Over the past 20 years , the senior author has had good success with these techniques but prospective , long-term outcome studies are needed to critically assess if these surgical techniques improve patients ' long-term function and pain.
