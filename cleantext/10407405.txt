  Sustainable catalysts for the oxidation of phenol derivatives under environmentally friendly conditions were prepared by the functionalization of lignin nanoparticles with tyrosinase. Lignin , the most abundant polyphenol in nature , is the main byproduct in the pulp and paper manufacturing industry and biorefinery. Tyrosinase has been immobilized by direct adsorption , encapsulation , and layer-by-layer deposition , with or without glutaraldehyde reticulation. Lignin nanoparticles were found to be stable to the tyrosinase activity. After the enzyme immobilization , they showed a moderate to high catalytic effect in the synthesis of catechol derivatives , with the efficacy of the catalyst being dependent on the specific immobilization procedures.
