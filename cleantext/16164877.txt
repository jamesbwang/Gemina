  Allergic asthma and obesity are major public health problems in the world. Recent Meta-analysis studies implicated a positive relationship between serum leptin , which is elevated in obese individuals , and the risk of asthma. However , it is not well understood how obesity-associated elevation of leptin increases the risk of asthma. In the current study , we have found that leptin induces the unfolded protein response factor XBP1s in an mTOR- and MAPK-dependent manner in pro-allergic TH2 cells; in vivo , mice fed with high fat diet had increased serum leptin as observed in human obese population and exacerbated asthmatic symptoms , associated with increased XBP1s expression in splenic CD4
