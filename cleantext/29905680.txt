  An end-to-end deep neural network , ResU-net , is developed for quantitative photoacoustic imaging. A residual learning framework is used to facilitate optimization and to gain better accuracy from considerably increased network depth. The contracting and expanding paths enable ResU-net to extract comprehensive context information from multispectral initial pressure images and , subsequently , to infer a quantitative image of chromophore concentration or oxygen saturation ( sO
