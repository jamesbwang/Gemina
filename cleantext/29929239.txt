  Lime amendment of biosolids can produce large quantities of hydroxyl ions and increase biosolids pH. The mobility of some pharmaceutical and personal care products ( PPCPs) is closely correlated with the pH of biosolids. In this study the mobility of six PPCPs: erythromycin , fluoxetine , carbamazepine , naproxen , gemfibrozil and triclosan , was measured in unamended and lime-amended biosolids over 63days. Biosolids were equilibrated either a at pH range of 5.5-11.5 or cured over a time period up to 63days. The mobility was calculated as the proportion of PPCPs associated with the soluble phase after a given equilibrium time or a curing period. In unamended biosolids the mobility of erythromycin , fluoxetine , gemfibrozil and triclosan decreased , the mobility of naproxen increased and the mobility of carbamazepine was almost unchanged over 63days of curing. Compared to unamended biosolids , lime addition increased the mobility of erythromycin and naproxen by 21.7 % and 33.8 % respectively , but suppressed the mobility of carbamazepine , fluoxetine , gemfibrozil and triclosan by up to 100 % after 63days. The pH influence on hydrophobicity and speciation of PPCPs correlated well with the mobility of erythromycin and fluoxetine , but only partially correlated with the mobility of the other 4 compounds over the pH of 5.5-11.5. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared ( ATR-FTIR) and emission-excitation matrices ( EEMs) provided spectroscopic evidences showing that the increases in amide and carboxylic groups , the decrease in polysaccharides , and the increases in humic substances in dissolved organic matter ( DOM) may be responsible for the changes in the PPCPs ' mobility. The effects of lime amendment lasted for approximately a month. The results of this work suggest that lime amendment prevents some PPCPs from being dissolved in biosolids soluble phases , but may not `` lock '' all PPCPs into biosolids.
