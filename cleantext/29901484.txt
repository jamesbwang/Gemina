  The health behaviors of hypertensive stroke patients in China are not satisfactory. In this study , we tested the effect of a Health Belief Model Comprehensive Reminder System on health behaviors and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control in hypertensive ischemic stroke patients after occurrence and hospital discharge. A randomized , parallel-group , assessor-blinded experimental design yielded participation of 174 hospitalized hypertensive ischemic stroke patients. The intervention consisted of face-to-face and telephone health belief education , a patient calendar handbook , and weekly automated short-message services. Data were collected at baseline and 3 months after discharge. Three months after discharge , the intervention group showed statistically , significantly better health behaviors for physical activity , nutrition , low-salt diet , and medication adherence. The intervention group also had statistically , significantly decreased systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> and increased blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control rate. Smoking and alcohol use behaviors were not affected. At 3 months , use of the Comprehensive Reminder System based on the Health Belief Model , yielded improvement in most health behaviors and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> control in hypertensive ischemic stroke patients. Continued implementation of this intervention protocol is warranted to determine the long-term effect. Smoking and alcohol use behaviors need to be targeted with a different intervention.
