  The anticipatory recognition of braking is essential to prevent traffic accidents. For instance , driving assistance systems can be useful to properly respond to emergency braking situations. Moreover , the response time to emergency braking situations can be affected and even increased by different driver 's cognitive states caused by stress , fatigue<symptom> , and extra workload. This work investigates the detection of emergency braking from driver 's electroencephalographic ( EEG) signals that precede the brake pedal actuation. Bioelectrical signals were recorded while participants were driving in a car simulator while avoiding potential collisions by performing emergency braking. In addition , participants were subjected to stress , workload , and fatigue<symptom>. EEG signals were classified using support vector machines ( SVM) and convolutional neural networks ( CNN) in order to discriminate between braking intention and normal driving. Results showed significant recognition of emergency braking intention which was on average 71.1 % for SVM and 71.8 % CNN. In addition , the classification accuracy for the best participant was 80.1 and 88.1 % for SVM and CNN , respectively. These results show the feasibility of incorporating recognizable driver 's bioelectrical responses into advanced driver-assistance systems to carry out early detection of emergency braking situations which could be useful to reduce car accidents.
