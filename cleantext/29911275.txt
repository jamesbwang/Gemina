  In our previous work , we showed that during inflammation-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) , mesenteric mesothelial cells express ED1 ( pan-macrophage marker) , indicating that they are transformed into macrophage-like cells. In this paper , we provide additional evidences about this transition by following the phagocytic activity and the TNFα production of mesenteric mesothelial cells during inflammation<symptom>. Upon injection of India ink particles or fluorescent-labeled bioparticles ( pHrodo) into the peritoneal cavity of rats pretreated with Freund 's adjuvant , we found that mesothelial cells efficiently engulfed these particles. A similar increase of internalization could be observed by mesothelial cells in GM-CSF pretreated primary mesenteric culture. Since macrophages are the major producers of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor , TNFα , we investigated expression level of TNFα during inflammation-induced EMT and found that TNFα was indeed expressed in these cells , reaching the highest level at the 5th day of inflammation<symptom>. Since TNFα is one of the target genes of early growth response ( EGR1) transcription factor , playing important role in monocyte-macrophage differentiation , expression of EGR1 in mesothelial cells was also investigated by Western blot and immunocytochemistry. While mesothelial cells did not express EGR1 , a marked increase was observed in mesothelial cells by the time of inflammation<symptom>. Parallel to this , nuclear translocation of EGR1 was shown by immunocytochemistry at the day 5 of inflammation<symptom>. Caveolin-1 level was high and ERK1/2 became phosphorylated as the inflammation<symptom> proceeded showing a slight decrease when the regeneration started. Our present data support the idea that under special stimuli , mesenteric mesothelial cells are able to transdifferentiate into macrophages , and this transition is regulated by the caveolin-1/ ERK1/2/EGR1 signaling pathway.
