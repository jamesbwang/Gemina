  Huntington 's disease ( HD) is a genetic , rare and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes motor and cognitive impairment in midlife patients. Although retinal damage was observed in animal HD models and in patients with other neurodegenerative diseases , we still need confirmation of impairment in HD patients. Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT) is a non-invasive methodology that analyzes the retinal nerve fiber layers ( RNFL) and could reflect processes of neurodegeneration. A cross-sectional study with 14 HD patients who underwent a spectral domain OCT.. Results were compared with a control group. Demographic data was also obtained. Temporal and superior RNFL sectors in HD showed a significant RNFL thinning compared with a control group. However , no differences were identified in mean total RNFL thickness between HD patients and controls. OCT is a rapid and non-invasive technique that can be investigated in larger cohorts of patients to assess its potential role as a biomarker in HD patients.
