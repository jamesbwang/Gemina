Morphologic properties of cartilage lesions<symptom> in the knee arthroscopically prepared by the standard curette technique are inferior to lesions<symptom> prepared by specialized chondrectomy instruments. Am J Sports Med. 2018; 46 ( 4): 908-914. ( Original DOI: 10.1177/ 0363546517745489) There is an error in the Abstract of this article. The Conclusion of the Abstract currently reads: Arthroscopic cartilage lesion<symptom> preparation with SC instruments results in superior perpendicularity of surrounding cartilage walls to subchondral bone and greater consistency of debrided lesion<symptom> depth , as compared with the standard debridement technique with curettes. It should have read: Arthroscopic cartilage lesion<symptom> preparation with CM instruments results in superior perpendicularity of surrounding cartilage walls to subchondral bone and greater consistency of debrided lesion<symptom> depth , as compared with the standard debridement technique with curettes.
