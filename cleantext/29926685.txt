  To investigate the effects of saffron aqueous extract ( SE) on blood glucose , lipid and pancreatic tissue in streptozocin-induced diabetes mice. Diabetes mellitus mice were established by intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin ( 60 mg/kg) for two consecutive days. The 30 well-established diabetes mice were randomly divided into three groups ( Compared with the normal control group , the amount of food-intake , water consumption , area under the curve , FBG , GSP , and total cholesterol ( TC) were significantly increased , while fasting weight , INS and high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-c) were dramatically decreased in DM group. Compared with DM group , the water consumption , FBG , area under the curve and TC in SE group were starkly declined with a notable elevation of HDL-c and INS. In addition , the biopsy from DM mice showed the structure of pancreas islet was destroyed and reduced , and vascular proliferation with irregular shape. The damaged pancreas was obviously repaired by giving SE. The saffron aqueous extract had efficacy on blood glucose and blood lipids reduction , improvement on damaged pancreas in streptozocininduced diabetic mice , which suggested that saffron could be used for the treatment in diabetes.
