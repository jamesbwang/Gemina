  People with diabetes are at high risk for shoulder pain , limited joint mobility , and adhesive capsulitis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a shoulder movement intervention ( ShoMo) compared to a wellness intervention on the primary outcomes of active shoulder flexion and reported Shoulder Pain and Disability Index ( SPADI) measured after intervention and 9 months later. The design was a prospective , randomized , controlled clinical trial. The setting was a research center at an academic medical center. Fifty-two participants with type 2 diabetes and shoulder pain or limited motion were randomized to a group receiving ShoMo ( N = 27; mean age = 59.3; SD = 7.0) or a group receiving wellness activities ( N = 25; mean age = 57.9; SD = 7.7). The ShoMo group received instruction in a progressive , active shoulder movement program. The wellness group received instruction in diabetes management. Measurements were made at baseline , after 3 months of intervention , and at 6 , 9 , and 12 months after baseline. After intervention , the ShoMo group had a 7.2-degree increase in active shoulder flexion compared with the wellness group ( 95 % CI = 0.9-13.5 Â°) , but there was no difference at subsequent follow-ups. The ShoMo group showed a 12.7-point improvement in the SPADI score compared to the wellness group after intervention ( 95 % CI = 1.1-24.3) , which remained better than the wellness group 9 months later. Number of participants and duration of follow-up was inadequate to determine if intervention can help to prevent future severe shoulder problems. A progressive shoulder movement program can have meaningful effects on active motion and symptoms in people with type 2 diabetes and mild-to-moderate shoulder symptoms , with symptom improvement lasting at least 9 months.
