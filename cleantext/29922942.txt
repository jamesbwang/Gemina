  Stage I non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) is a localized disease without metastasis; therefore , it can be treated effectively with local therapies. Pulmonary resection is the most frequent treatment , performed as pulmonary wedge resection , segmentectomy , lobectomy , or pneumonectomy. Some retrospective clinical studies of pulmonary wedge resection suggest that its outcome may be inferior to that of anatomical pulmonary resection , whereas other recent studies , which assess surgical margin status , leveled acceptable outcomes. Since the outcome of pulmonary wedge resection for lung cancer may depend on tumor size , distance from the surgical margin to the tumor , tumor size/margin distance ratio , and margin cytology results , a prospective study assessing these parameters is ongoing. This will allow us to identify the clinical implications of these factors and predict which patients are likely to have a good outcome.
