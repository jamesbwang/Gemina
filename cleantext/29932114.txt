  Due to the importance of sensors in control strategy and safety , early detection of faults in sensors has become a key point to improve the availability of railway traction drives. The presented sensor fault reconstruction is based on sliding mode observers and equivalent injection signals , and it allows detecting defective sensors and isolating faults. Moreover , the severity of faults is provided. The proposed on-board fault reconstruction has been validated in a hardware-in-the-loop platform , composed of a real-time simulator and a commercial traction control unit for a tram. Low computational resources , robustness to measurement noise , and easiness to tune are the main requirements for industrial acceptance. As railway applications are not safety-critical systems , compared to aerospace applications , a fault evaluation procedure is proposed , since there is enough time to perform diagnostic tasks. This procedure analyses the fault reconstruction in the steady state , delaying the decision-making in some seconds , but minimising false detections.
