  Concurrent occurrence of subdural hematoma ( SDH) in the cranial as well as spinal compartment of craniospinal axis is extremely uncommon. In a detailed PubMed/Medline search , we could find only four cases of spontaneous concurrent craniospinal SDH , and adding our one case to the preexisting literature and thus reviewing total five cases. Spontaneous concurrent intraspinal and intracranial subdural hematoma affected exclusively male in their fourth to fifth decades of life with a mean age of 37.4 years ( range 14-59 years). Four cases were managed conservatively and one case needed evacuation of spinal SDH. All cases had good outcome. The authors report an interesting case of spontaneous occurrence of concurrent craniospinal SDH in a boy , who was managed successfully with symptomatic treatment along with blood and blood product transfusion without need of surgical intervention. To the best of authors ' knowledge , current case represents first of its kind occurring in pediatric age in the Western literature. Diagnosis and management along with the pertinent literature is reviewed briefly.
