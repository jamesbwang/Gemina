  Stress is integral to tumour evolution , and cancer cell survival depends on stress management. We found that cancer-associated stress chronically activates the bioenergetic sensor AMP kinase ( AMPK) and , to survive , tumour cells hijack an AMPK-regulated stress response pathway conserved in normal cells. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data revealed that AMPK isoforms are highly expressed in the lethal human cancer glioblastoma ( GBM). We show that AMPK inhibition reduces viability of patient-derived GBM stem cells ( GSCs) and tumours. In stressed ( exercised) skeletal muscle , AMPK is activated to cooperate with CREB1 ( cAMP response element binding protein-1) and promote glucose metabolism. We demonstrate that oncogenic stress chronically activates AMPK in GSCs that coopt the AMPK-CREB1 pathway to coordinate tumour bioenergetics through the transcription factors HIF1Î± and GABPA. Finally , we show that adult mice tolerate systemic deletion of AMPK , supporting the use of AMPK pharmacological inhibitors in the treatment of GBM.
