  The influence of natural convection on lamellar eutectic growth was determined by a comprehensive phase-field lattice-Boltzmann study for Al-Cu and CBr _ ( 4)- C _ ( 2) Cl _ ( 6) eutectic alloys. The mass differences resulting from concentration differences led to the fluid flow and a robust parallel and adaptive mesh refinement algorithm was employed to improve the computational efficiency. By means of carefully designed `` numerical experiments '' , the eutectic growth under natural convection was explored and a simple analytical model was proposed to predict the adjustment of the lamellar spacing. Furthermore , by alternating the solute expansion coefficient , initial lamellar spacing , and undercooling , the microstructure evolution was presented and compared with the classical eutectic growth theory. Results showed that both interfacial solute distribution and average curvature were affected by the natural convection , the effect of which could be further quantified by adding a constant into the growth rule proposed by Jackson and Hunt ( Jackson and Hunt , Trans. Metall. Soc. AIME 236 , 1129 ( 1966)).
