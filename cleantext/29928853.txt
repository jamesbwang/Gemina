  It is uncertain with the outcomes of different repair strategies of anomalous left coronary artery from pulmonary artery ( ALCAPA) in adolescent and adult patients. The long-term outcomes of reimplantation and Takeuchi repair were compared in this study. We conducted a retrospective review of data collected from patients receiving ALCAPA repair at our institute from January 2005 to December 2016. Short- and long-term outcomes of re-implantation and Takeuchi repair were compared. A total of 50 consecutive patients underwent ALCAPA repair , with an average age of 31.6 Â± 15.6 years and 66 % of women. No significant differences were found in short-term outcomes between the two groups. However , at a median of 65.7 months ' follow-up , the MACE ( including all cause death , admission due to heart<symptom> failure<symptom> , new-onset acute myocardial infarction and repeated revascularization) rate of the Takeuchi group was significantly lower than the re-implantation group ( HR , 0.21; 95 % CI , 0.04 to 0.97). Furthermore , pre-operative glucose level was significantly associated with increased MACE rate ( HR , 10.82; 95 % CI , 1.20 to 97.54). Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction significantly improved in both groups. However , mitral valvuloplasty did n't predict long-term recovery of left ventricular function. Although short-term outcomes were satisfactory in both groups , a higher MACE rate was observed in re-implantation group than Takeuchi repair group; mitral valvuloplasty was n't significantly associated with improved prognosis and left ventricular reverse remodeling. Elevation of preoperative blood glucose level was significantly associated with increasing long-term MACE rate.
