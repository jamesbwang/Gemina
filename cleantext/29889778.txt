  Patients with subjective nonpulsatile tinnitus<symptom> and a normal conventional audiogram have more objective audiologic evidence of hidden hearing loss and deafferentation-related pathology than patients without tinnitus<symptom>. The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiologic characteristics and audiologic profiles , including auditory brainstem response ( ABR) , distortion product otoacoustic emission , and threshold-equalizing noise test results , in patients with tinnitus<symptom> and a normal audiogram. The test results for 20 patients complaining of nonpulsatile chronic tinnitus<symptom> were compared with those of 91 subjects with normal hearing and no tinnitus<symptom>. Patients with unilateral tinnitus<symptom> had higher tinnitus<symptom> handicap inventory scores than those with bilateral tinnitus<symptom> ( p < 0.05). Threshold-equalizing noise tests were normal in all study participants. In patients with unilateral tinnitus<symptom> , the ABR and distortion product otoacoustic emission test results were similar to those of controls. In contrast , patients with bilateral tinnitus<symptom> showed a shortening of latency in wave III of the ABR on the right ( p = 0.047) and in wave V on the left ( p = 0.024). Logistic regression analysis revealed that enhanced wave III/I ( p = 0.018) and V/I ( p = 0.012) ratios on the left and poorer pure-tone average on the right were significant risk factors for bilateral tinnitus<symptom>. The mechanism involved in the development of tinnitus<symptom> may depend on its laterality. Bilateral tinnitus<symptom> may be associated with hyperactivity at the level of the cochlear nucleus whereas a higher-order cortical area may be involved in unilateral
