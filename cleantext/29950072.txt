  To compare the effect of integration processing technology of origin ( IPTO) and traditional cutting processing technology ( TCPT) of Moslae Herba for lung-Yang deficiency rats caused by complex factors , analyze the mechanism , and provide the modern pharmacology basis for the implementation of IPTO of Moslae Herba. The rat models of lung-Yang deficiency were established by smoking + swimming in ice water + drinking ice water. The model rats were randomly divided into different groups , and were treated with intragastric administration for 30 d. Then the general signs , anal temperature and autonomic activity of the rats were observed. The pathological morphology of lung tissues was observed , and the positive expression of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor ( TNF-α) was observed by immunohistochemical method , and the hematological indexes were determined. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) method was used to detect serum nitric oxide ( NO) , immunoglobulin G ( IGG) , malondialdehyde ( MDA) , thromboxane B2 ( TXB2) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8) level , and the organ coefficients of heart , liver , spleen , lung , kidney and other organs were calculated. According to the results , Moslae Herba volatile oil and decoction could improve the general signs and autonomic activities of lung-Yang deficiency rats , improve the body<symptom> weight , rectal temperature , and the content of IGG in serum of lung-Yang deficiency rats , reduce organ coefficients of heart , liver , spleen , lung and kidney , serum NO , MDA , TXB2 , IL-8 contents , white blood cell and TNF-α mean optical density in the lung tissues of rats. witg statistically significant difference (
