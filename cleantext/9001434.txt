  Although rare , secondary clonal hematologic neoplasia may occur after successful therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia<disease> ( APL). These secondary clonal events may be considered therapy-related , but may also be due to an underlying background of clonal hematopoiesis from which both malignancies may develop. In this manuscript , we describe two patients with secondary clones after APL therapy characterized in one patient by deletion of chromosome 11q23 and , in the other , by monosomy of chromosome 7 , and also provide a review of all secondary clonal disorders described after APL therapy. We suggest that since most reports identify karyotypic abnormalities not typically associated with chemotherapy , there may be another mechanism underlying secondary clonal development after complete response to initial APL therapy.
