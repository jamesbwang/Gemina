  Real-time lattice quantum electrodynamics ( QED) provides a unique tool for simulating plasmas in the strong-field regime , where collective plasma scales are not well separated from relativistic-quantum scales. As a toy model , we study scalar QED , which describes self-consistent interactions between charged bosons and electromagnetic fields. To solve this model on a computer , we first discretize the scalar-QED action on a lattice , in a way that respects geometric structures of exterior calculus and U ( 1)- gauge symmetry. The lattice scalar QED can then be solved , in the classical-statistics regime , by advancing an ensemble of statistically equivalent initial conditions in time , using classical field equations obtained by extremizing the discrete action. To demonstrate the capability of our numerical scheme , we apply it to two example problems. The first example is the propagation of linear waves , where we recover analytic wave dispersion relations using numerical spectrum. The second example is an intense laser interacting with a one-dimensional plasma slab , where we demonstrate natural transition from wakefield acceleration to pair production when the wave amplitude exceeds the Schwinger threshold. Our real-time lattice scheme is fully explicit and respects local conservation laws , making it reliable for long-time dynamics. The algorithm is readily parallelized using domain decomposition , and the ensemble may be computed using quantum parallelism in the future.
