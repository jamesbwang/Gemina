  Abnormal inflammatory bias in the maternal-fetal interface leads to reproductive failure in mammals. Placental exosomes are involved in maternal-fetal communication during pregnancy. However , whether the placenta or fetus is involved in regulating the balance<symptom> of uterine local inflammation<symptom> through exosomes remains unclear , and the mechanism must be further explored. Here we demonstrated that placenta-specific exosomes are abundant in the peripheral blood of dairy cows during early pregnancy and selectively load miRNAs , such as bta-miR-499. In vitro , placental exosome-derived bta-miR-499 inhibits the activation of NF-ÎºB via the Lin28B/let -7 axis , thus repressing LPS-induced inflammation<symptom> in bovine endometrial epithelial ( BEND) cells. Subsequently , inhibition of mmu-miR-499 leads to an impaired balance<symptom> of inflammation<symptom> at the maternal-fetal interface in vivo , resulting in an increased risk of pregnancy failure due to placental loss and fetal growth restriction. Thus , our data demonstrate that placental exosomal miR-499 may be a critical immune regulator in the regulation of the inflammation<symptom> balance<symptom> at the maternal-fetal interface in the early gestation of dairy cows and other mammals.
