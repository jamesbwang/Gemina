  The deep branch of the radial nerve ( DBRN) enters the forearm as it passes under the arcade of Frohse. This is the most common entrapment site of the DBRN in the forearm. In this study , we investigated the ultrasonographic reference values for the diameters and cross-sectional area ( CSA) of the DBRN at the level of the arcade of Frohse in a healthy sample of the population. Sixty-five healthy Caucasian volunteers ( 130 nerves) were recruited for this study. The reference range ( mean ± 2 standard deviations ( SD); 2.5th-97.5 th quintiles) and the upper limit of the side-to-side difference were determined. The effects of age , gender , handedness , height , and body mass index were examined. The mean age was 41.8 ± 11.2 years ( range 18-75 years). The mean ± 2SD of the CSA was 0.50-1.42 mm The measurements obtained in this study are valuable for examining DBRN pathologies using high-frequency ultrasound. The findings showed that age was associated with the DBRN CSA , while gender , height , and body mass index were not.
