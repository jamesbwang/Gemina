  Multiple sclerosis ( MS) is a progressive inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS of unknown cause that remains incurable. Inflammasome-associated caspases mediate the maturation and release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-18 and activate the pore-forming protein gasdermin D ( GSDMD). Inflammatory programmed cell death , pyroptosis , was recently shown to be mediated by GSDMD. Here , we report molecular evidence for GSDMD-mediated inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in both myeloid cells ( macrophages/microglia) and , unexpectedly , in myelin-forming oligodendrocytes ( ODCs) in the CNS of patients with MS and in the MS animal model , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis<disease> ( EAE). We observed inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in human microglia and ODCs in vitro after exposure to inflammatory stimuli and demonstrate caspase-1 inhibition by the small-molecule inhibitor VX-765 in both cell types. GSDMD inhibition by siRNA transduction suppressed pyroptosis in human microglia. VX-765 treatment of EAE animals reduced the expression of inflammasome- and pyroptosis-associated proteins in the CNS , prevented axonal injury , and improved neurobehavioral performance. Thus , GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in select glia cells is a previously unrecognized mechanism of inflammatory demyelination and represents a unique therapeutic opportunity for mitigating the disease process in MS and other CNS
