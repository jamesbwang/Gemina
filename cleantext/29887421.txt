  Bile leakage after subtotal cholecystectomy ( SC) is clinically serious. To prevent such leakage , we developed a new surgical technique in which a free piece of omentum is plugged into the gallbladder stump ( omentum plugging technique). We evaluated whether the omentum plugging technique prevents bile leakage after subtotal cholecystectomy. Prospectively collected data of patients who had undergone subtotal cholecystectomy without cystic duct closure in the Department of Surgery of Kansai Medical University during the 12 years from January 2006 to March 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. The outcomes of patients who had undergone subtotal cholecystectomy with the omentum plugging technique ( omentum plugging technique group) were compared with those of patients who had undergone subtotal cholecystectomy without the omentum plugging technique ( Control group). The outcomes of interest were perioperative data and postoperative complications including bile leakage , necessity for interventions for complications , and duration of hospitalization. Fifty of 2,447 consecutive patients ( 2.0 %) had undergone subtotal cholecystectomy. Of these 50 patients , 18 were treated with the omentum plugging technique ( omentum plugging technique group) and 32 were treated without the omentum plugging technique ( Control group). One of 18 patients in the omentum plugging technique group and 14 of 32 in the Control group developed postoperative bile leakage. One postoperative interventional treatment for complications was performed in the omentum plugging technique group and 12 in the Control group. The duration of postoperative hospitalization was less in the omentum plugging technique group. The omentum plugging technique appears to be an effective operative technique for preventing postoperative bile leakage in selected situations when a `` difficult gallbladder '' is encountered.
