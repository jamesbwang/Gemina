  1. Lipid metabolism is an indispensable process in an organism , though little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of fat deposition in different types of adipose tissue. 2. The differentially expressed genes related to triglyceride ( TG) metabolism between abdominal and intramuscular fat of Beijing-You chickens were investigated in this study. 3. TG content in abdominal fat ( 349.7 mg/g) was significantly higher ( P < 0.01) than in the breast and thigh ( 12.3 mg/g and 24.8 mg/g , respectively). 4. Using Agilent chicken gene expression profiling in adipose tissues between abdominal fat and muscle ( breast and thigh) , certain representative genes related to fatty acid metabolism , lipoprotein catabolism and esterification reactions were significantly up-regulated ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). 5. Genes involved in fatty acid oxidation or carbohydrate utilisation were significantly up- or down-regulated ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) , including those involved with highly enriched pathways of lipid metabolism ( PPAR , Wnt pathway , inositol phosphate metabolism) , cell junctions ( focal adhesion , regulation of actin cytoskeleton) , and muscle contraction. 6. Overall , higher TG levels were observed in abdominal fat tissue than in adipose tissues of breast and thigh , which could be regulated through gene expression of pathways related to lipid metabolism ( PPAR , Wnt pathway , inositol phosphate metabolism) , cell junctions ( focal adhesion , regulation of actin cytoskeleton) , and muscle contraction. These results provide clues to understanding the molecular mechanisms of TG metabolism between abdominal and intramuscular fat.
