  The coexistence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL/SLL) with different gynecologic neoplasms is a rare phenomenon. Here , we report a case of simultaneously developed CLL/SLL with endometrioid-type uterine cancer. A 58-year-old woman was admitted to the 2nd Department of Gynecology , Lublin Medical University , Lublin , Poland , in June 2017 , where the uterine cancer was diagnosed. After the surgery , pathological examination revealed a uterine moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of endometrioid subtype ( subtype I according to Bokhman) deeply infiltrating the myometrium as well as the uterine cervix. Surprisingly , CLL/SLL was subsequently diagnosed in all removed pelvic as well as para-aortic lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical analysis showed CD45 ( + +) , CD20 ( +) , CD3 (-/ +) , CD19 ( +) , CD23 ( +) , CD5 ( +) , and CD34 ( +). Proliferative activity , assessed by MIB-1 proliferative index immunostaining , reached 18 %. The patient was admitted to radiotherapy and chemotherapy at the Oncology Hospital , Lublin , Poland , and is still on follow-up. The coexistence of CLL/SLL with various gynecological malignancies , especially primary human endometrial cancer , is a rare entity. The detection of both tumors simultaneously , in general , is accidental , and the management should not be different from the situation in which malignancy appears de novo.
