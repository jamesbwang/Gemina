  Autoimmune liver diseases ( AILD) can recur following liver transplantation despite immunosuppressive therapy , with implications for graft survival. Although the evidence is not robust , disease recurrence seems to occur in the presence of less intense and/or steroid-free immunosuppression in particular in the case of autoimmune hepatitis<disease> ( AIH). The main risk factor for AIH recurrence is the severity of disease activity in the explant and potentially donor/recipient HLA-DR3 mismatch. The treatment for AIH recurrence includes reintroduction or increase in the dose of steroids with or without the addition of Azathioprine. T cell-mediated rejection episodes are also more common in AILD. Steroid withdrawal is the common practice in liver transplantation for non-AILD , eliminating the risks associated with long-term exposure to steroids. In AILD , maintenance of steroids at a low dose long-term may reduce the risk of disease recurrence and rejection. This strategy is safe when there is vigilance for steroid-related side effects. Alternatively , identifying patient who are greatest risk for disease recurrence and who would benefit from intensified immunosuppression might be an option. This article is protected by copyright.
