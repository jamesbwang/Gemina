  Increased extracellular matrix ( ECM) formation and matrix metalloprotease ( MMP)- mediated ECM degradation are parts of tumorgenesis and generates specific collagen fragments that are released into circulation. We evaluated the association of specific collagen fragments measured in serum with outcomes in two independent metastatic breast cancer ( MBC) cohorts. ELISAs were used to measure C1M ( MMP-generated type I collagen fragment) , C3M ( MMP-generated type III collagen fragment) , C4M ( MMP-generated type IV collagen fragment) , and PRO-C3 ( pro-peptide of type III collagen) in pre-treatment serum from a phase 3 randomized clinical trial of 2
