  Patients with severe aortic stenosis ( AS) are subjected to left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH) with increasing morbidity and mortality. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) induces reverse left ventricular remodeling which can be monitored by cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR). CMR is able to analyze myocardial tissue properties by magnetic relaxation times ( parametric CMR). The objective of this study was to study myocardial T2 relaxation in reverse ventricular remodeling after TAVR. Forty-three patients with severe AS ( 19 males , 81.9 ± 4.9 years) underwent CMR with T2 mapping before and 6 months after TAVR. A cohort of age- and gender-matched volunteers served as controls. Analyzed parameters included left ventricular ejection fraction ( LV-EF) , mass indexed to body surface area ( LVMi) , interventricular septum thickness ( IVS) , end-diastolic volume ( LVEDV) , global longitudinal strain ( GLS) , peak diastolic strain rate ( SRe) and myocardial T2 values. CMR characteristics for patients with AS displayed LVH concomitant to elevated myocardial T2 values , reduced GLS and SRe. Patients with T2 values above 70.2 ms at baseline were characterized by eccentric hypertrophy with reduced LV-EF. T2 values decreased after TAVR ( 67.4 ± 3.4 to 63.3 ± 4.2 ms , p < 0.01) during left ventricular remodeling. Patients with T2 values above 70.2 ms at baseline exhibited pronounced reverse remodeling which proved to be a significant predictor of LV-EF improvement and LVEDV reduction in uni- and multivariate analyses. Multiparametric CMR can be used to characterize myocardial hypertrophy due to severe AS and to monitor myocardial adaptations after TAVR. It may provide additional information in the prediction of left ventricular remodeling after TAVR.
