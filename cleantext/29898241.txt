  The release of uranyl ( VI) is a hazardous environmental issue , with limited ways to monitor accumulation in situ. Here , we present a method for the detection of uranyl ( VI) ions through the utilization of a unique fluorescence energy transfer process to europium ( III). Our system displays the first example of a `` turn-on '' europium ( III) emission process with a small , water-soluble lanthanide complex triggered by uranyl ( VI) ions.
