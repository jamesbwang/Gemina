  To investigate whether maternal overweight and obesity increased the risk of fetal acidosis measured in umbilical cord arterial blood after delivery. Population-based cohort study of 84,785 term ( ≥ 37 weeks) infants. Logistic regression was used to estimate risks of fetal acidosis in umbilical cord arterial blood. Fetal acidosis was defined as pH < 7.10 or as pH < 1st percentile on a normal reference curve. Risks of fetal acidosis increased , regardless of definition , with maternal overweight and obesity severity. Compared to normal weight ( BMI 18.5- < 25) , the odds ratios ( 95 % confidence interval) for pH < 7.10 were 1.35 ( 1.23-1.47) for overweight ( BMI 25- < 30) , 1.46 ( 1.27-1.69) for mild obesity ( BMI 30- < 35) , and 1.75 ( 1.42-2.15) for severe obesity ( BMI ≥ 35). The association for obesity was attenuated in analyses restricted to non-instrumental vaginal deliveries. Maternal overweight and obesity increased the risk of fetal acidosis. More complicated deliveries in obese women may partially explain this association.
