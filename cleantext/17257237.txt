  The purpose of this manuscript is to illuminate the diagnostic challenges in patients who present with both headache<symptom> and neck<symptom> pain<symptom>. The differential diagnosis for headache<symptom> and neck<symptom> pain<symptom> includes many conditions. Furthermore , cervical musculoskeletal abnormalities including head forward posture<symptom> and myofascial trigger points may play an overlapping role in many of these conditions. Multiple<symptom> headache<symptom> disorders may be present within the same patient. A multidisciplinary team approach addressing all components of the headache<symptom> may lead to better outcomes for these patients.
