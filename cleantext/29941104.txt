  Gold nanoparticles ( Au NPs) are very attractive and versatile nanoparticles since they have a remarkable capacity to absorb and scatter light , convert optical energy into heat via nonradiative electron relaxation dynamics , and surface chemistries that can be capitalized upon so that the nanoparticles act as drug carriers. Au NPs have excellent stability and biocompatibility , tailorable shapes and sizes , an easily functionalized surface , high drug-loading capacity , and low toxicity. The properties of Au NPs can be leveraged to develop more precisely targeted and effective cancer therapeutics. Au NPs have been used to target delivery of chemotherapeutic agents , complement radiation and thermal therapy , and enhance contrast for in vivo imaging of the tumor in a variety of cancer types and diseased organs.
