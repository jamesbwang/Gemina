  There is accumulating evidence that vascular inflammation<symptom> plays critical roles in pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. It is widely accepted that both innate and adaptive immune responses are important for initiation and progression of atherosclerosis , which mainly consist of monocytes , macrophages , neutrophils , T lymphocytes , and B lymphocytes. Moreover , inflammatory biomarkers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 are known to predict future cardiovascular events , as well as conventional low-density or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Thus , current understanding of the inflammatory mechanisms of atherosclerosis have led us to explore novel therapeutic approaches that reducing vascular inflammation<symptom> itself could lower the rates of critical cardiovascular events. To address the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis , results of the Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study ( CANTOS) trial have been recently reported that anti-inflammatory therapy using canakinumab , a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1Î² , significantly reduced recurrent cardiovascular events for secondary prevention of myocardial infarction at high inflammatory risk. In this review , we will first outline the mechanisms of atherosclerosis , especially focusing on their inflammatory aspects. Then we will introduce several critical inflammatory biomarkers that contribute to risk stratification of clinical cardiovascular events. Lastly , we will discuss potentiality and future perspectives of reducing inflammation<symptom> as a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.
