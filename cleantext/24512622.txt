  Chiari malformations ( CM) are a group of neuroanatomical pathologies resulting from overcrowding of the hindbrain. The purpose of this review is to characterize Chiari headache<symptom> ( CH) and describe diagnosis and treatment of the condition. Recent research has helped solidify the criteria for diagnosis of CH. Imaging studies have expanded our understanding of the morphological features producing them and helped to better characterize the pathophysiology. Additionally , identifying this unusual headache<symptom> disorder accurately has helped with specific treatment options. CH is a disabling condition which can effect multiple domains of a patient 's life. The diagnostic criteria has improved , and we now have a better understanding of the pathophysiology and imaging findings associated with CH. Future research is warranted to find new treatment options for individuals suffering from this condition.
