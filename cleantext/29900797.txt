  A 9-yr-old , entire female captive rock hyrax ( Procavia capensis) was presented with a 1-wk history of sialorrhea. On clinical examination , a mass was identified , encompassing the rostral mandible and intermandibular area , with associated mucosal ulceration , marked gingival recession , and loosening or loss of adjacent teeth. Skull radiography and cytology of fine-needle aspirates of the mass were suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma. Based on a suspected poor prognosis , the animal was humanely euthanized. Postmortem histological examination of samples confirmed a diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma with invasion of mandibular bone. Neoplasia is uncommonly reported in hyraxes , which has led to the assumption that they may share mechanisms of cancer resistance with elephants , their closest extant relatives. This is the first report of squamous cell carcinoma in this species.
