  In England and Wales , family group conferences ( FGCs) are most often found either in the field of youth justice or in the field of child protection , and consequently often have priorities in line with either one of the two systems. On the one hand , FGCs are a restorative justice tool to address offending behavior and hold young perpetrators to account , while giving victims the possibility of contributing to the justice process. On the other hand , FGCs address safeguarding concerns and are used to plan for child safety and protection. In cases where a young person has sexually harmed another young person , that is , has perpetrated harmful sexual behavior ( HSB) , all young people involved will have both justice and welfare needs. FGCs are emerging as promising mechanisms in such cases , not only because of their ability to deal with both sets of needs for both young people but also because of their potential to address more holistic needs. However , HSB cases are often complex and sensitive , and are not without risk. Drawing on their experiences in research and practice , the authors explore how the holistic needs of both the harmed and harming individual can be balanced within a risk managed HSB-FGC framework.
