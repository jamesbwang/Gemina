  E coli has three Cls-isoenzymes for cardiolipin ( CL) synthesis but the differences between these three enzymes remain unresolved. All three Cls enzymes contain the phospholipase D ( PLD) characteristic HKD motive and synthesize CL using PLD activity. Here , using LC-MS we show the effect of overexpressing or deletion of the three individual Cls enzymes on the lipidome , which included changes in lipid class distribution and CL species profiles. We demonstrate , for the first time , that overexpression of only ClsB resulted in the appreciable synthesis of a variety of phosphatidylalcohols , thereby establishing a ` classic ' PLD activity for this enzyme: phospholipid headgroup exchange. Endogenous E.<pathogen> coli<pathogen> lipids and primary alcohols were substrates for this trans-phosphatidylation reaction. Furthermore , we show that endogenous levels of ClsA mediated a similar trans-phosphatidylation reaction to form phosphatidylalcohols , however this reaction was dependent on the presence of the foreign phospholipid class phosphatidylcholine ( PC). This allows us to clarify the different specificities of the cardiolipin synthases.
