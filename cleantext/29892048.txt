  Slow waves ( 0.5-4 Hz) predominate in the cortical electroencephalogram during non-rapid eye movement<symptom> ( NREM) sleep in mammals. They reflect the synchronization of large neuronal ensembles alternating between active ( UP) and quiescent ( Down) states and propagating along the neocortex. The thalamic contribution to cortical UP states and sleep modulation remains unclear. Here we show that spontaneous firing of centromedial thalamus ( CMT) neurons in mice is phase-advanced to global cortical UP states and NREM-wake transitions. Tonic optogenetic activation of CMT neurons induces NREM-wake transitions , whereas burst activation mimics UP states in the cingulate cortex and enhances brain-wide synchrony of cortical slow waves during sleep , through a relay in the anterodorsal thalamus. Finally , we demonstrate that CMT and anterodorsal thalamus relay neurons promote sleep recovery. These findings suggest that the tonic and/or burst firing pattern of CMT neurons can modulate brain-wide cortical activity during sleep and provides dual control of sleep-wake states.
