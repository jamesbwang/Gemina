  Many predators fracture strong mollusk shells , requiring specialized weaponry and behaviors. The current shell fracture paradigm is based on jaw- and claw-based predators that slowly apply forces ( high impulse , low peak force). However , predators also strike shells with transient intense impacts ( low impulse , high peak force). Toward the goal of incorporating impact fracture strategies into the prevailing paradigm , we measured how mantis shrimp<disease> (
