  Oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS) , a fundamental energy source in all human tissues , requires interactions between mitochondrial ( mtDNA)- and nuclear ( nDNA)- encoded protein subunits. Although such interactions are fundamental to OXPHOS , bi-genomic coregulation is poorly understood. To address this question , we analyzed âˆ¼ 8500 RNA-seq experiments from 48 human body sites. Despite well-known variation in mitochondrial activity , quantity , and morphology , we found overall positive mtDNA-nDNA OXPHOS genes ' co-expression across human tissues. Nevertheless , negative mtDNA-nDNA gene expression correlation was identified in the hypothalamus , basal ganglia , and amygdala ( subcortical brain regions , collectively termed the `` primitive '' brain). Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of mouse and human brains revealed that this phenomenon is evolutionarily conserved , and both are influenced by brain cell types ( involving excitatory/inhibitory neurons and nonneuronal cells) and by their spatial brain location. As the `` primitive '' brain is highly oxidative , we hypothesized that such negative mtDNA-nDNA co-expression likely controls for the high mtDNA transcript levels , which enforce tight OXPHOS regulation , rather than rewiring toward glycolysis. Accordingly , we found `` primitive '' brain-specific up-regulation of lactate dehydrogenase B (
