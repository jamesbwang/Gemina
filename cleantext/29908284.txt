  Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women worldwide. Breast tumors mostly exhibit aberrant gene expression and DNA hypermethylation patterns that predispose the disease. Understanding the genetic and epigenetic factors that contribute to breast cancer development is important to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic markers. SCARA5: Scavenger receptor class A , member 5; is a member of the scavenger receptor family located on chromosome 8p21 which is a frequently deleted region in human cancers. SCARA5 has been identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in various kinds of cancer. However , its role in breast cancer remains unclear. Therefore , in the present study SCARA5 expression levels in breast tumors and matched noncancerous tissue samples from 77 patients were analyzed by qRT-PCR and the expression levels were correlated with the methylation level of SCARA5 gene promoter. We found that SCARA5 expression was significantly decreased in tumors ( 92.2 %) compared to non-cancerous tissue samples and this down-regulation was associated with hypermethylation of the promoter ( p < 0.001). A significant correlation was also detected between SCARA5 expression and the histological grade of the breast tumors ( p = 0.017). Taken together , our results indicate that SCARA5 may play an important role in tumorigenesis of breast cancer via promoter methylation.
