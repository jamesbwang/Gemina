  The homogeneous dehydrative decarbonylation of fatty acid methyl esters ( FAMEs) to form olefins is reported. In order to facilitate cleavage of the unactivated acyl C-O bond of the alkyl ester , a one pot dual-catalytic directing group strategy was developed through optimization of the individual transesterification and decarbonylation reaction steps.
