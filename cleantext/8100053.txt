  Memory formation is achieved by genetically tightly controlled molecular pathways that result in a change of synaptic strength and synapse organization. While for short-term memory traces , rapidly acting biochemical pathways are in place , the formation of long-lasting memories requires changes in the transcriptional program of a cell. Although many genes involved in learning and memory formation have been identified , little is known about the genetic mechanisms required for changing the transcriptional program during different phases of long-term memory ( LTM) formation.
