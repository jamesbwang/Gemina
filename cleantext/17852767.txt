  Financial strain and discrimination are consistent predictors of negative health outcomes and maladaptive coping behaviors , including tobacco use. Although there is considerable information exploring stress and smoking , limited research has examined the relationship between patterns of stress domains and specific tobacco/nicotine product use. Even fewer studies have assessed ethnic variations in these relationships. This study investigated the relationship between discrimination and financial strain and current tobacco/nicotine product use and explored the ethnic variation in these relationships among diverse sample of US adults ( Higher levels of discrimination were associated with higher odds of all three tobacco/nicotine product categories. Financial strain was positively associated with combustible tobacco and combined tobacco/nicotine product use. Financial strain was especially risky for Non-Hispanic Whites ( AOR: 1.191 , 95 % CI: 1.083-1.309) and Blacks/African Americans ( AOR: 1.542 , 95 % CI: 1.106-2.148) , as compared to other groups , whereas discrimination was most detrimental for Asians/Pacific Islanders ( AOR: 3.827 , 95 % CI: 1.832-7.997) and Hispanics/Latinas/Latinos ( AOR: 2.517 , 95 % CI: 1.603-3.952). Findings suggest discrimination and financial stressors are risk factors for use of multiple tobacco/nicotine products , highlighting the importance of prevention research that accounts for these stressors. Because ethnic groups may respond differently to stress/strain , prevention research needs to identify cultural values , beliefs , and coping strategies that can buffer the negative consequences of discrimination and financial stressors.
