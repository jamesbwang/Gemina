  Both prevalence and incidence of the metabolic syndrome<disease> is very high in women with polycystic ovary syndrome<disease> ( PCOS). Obesity and visceral fat enlargement play a dominant role in determining the final phenotype of PCOS. Androgen excess and insulin resistance may be responsible for the development of all features of the metabolic syndrome<disease>. The major factors responsible for this association seem to be related to a triumvirate including androgen excess , insulin resistance and associated hyperinsulinemia , and obesity , particularly the abdominal-visceral phenotype. With respect to obesity , it can be suggested that the association may be bidirectional , in the sense that obesity can worsen the phenotype of PCOS when present and can also be responsible for the development of a secondary form of PCOS even in susceptible subjects. In spite of the strong association among a long list of cardiovascular risk factors , there is no evidence that women with PCOS may be affected by an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality. Future research should carry out a detailed investigation into the potential role of androgen excess in determining the insulin resistant state and , specifically , the very high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
