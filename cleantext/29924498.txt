  Although patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) benefit from treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs) , outcomes are limited by the eventual development of acquired resistance. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of EGFR-TKI therapy beyond focal progression , associated with microwave ablation. Patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKIs at our institutions from May 2012 to December 2017 were identified. Patients with single lesion<symptom> progression , treated with MWA , and continually administered EGFR-TKI therapy until further progression , were included in the study. Initial response to target therapy , median progression-free survival ( PFS1) , and first progression site were recorded. The median time to progression after local therapy ( PFS2) was also assessed. Overall survival was calculated from the initiation of EGFR-TKIs to the date of final follow-up or death. Fifteen out of 205 patients ( 10 %) satisfied the inclusion criteria. Local therapy was well tolerated , and complete ablation was performed in 11 ( 73.3 %) patients. The median PFS1 was 9.5 months ( range 6-41) , and the median PFS2 was 8 months ( range 3-24). The corresponding 6 and 12 month PFS rates were 73.3 % and 26.7 % , respectively. Median overall survival was 23 months ( range 15-64). The longer disease control observed in our patients suggests that continuation of EGFR-TKI beyond focal progression associated to microwave ablation is an efficacious therapeutic strategy.
