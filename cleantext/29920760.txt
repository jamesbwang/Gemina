  International reports have suggested that food allergies and food-induced anaphylaxis have increased in children. We investigated the incidence of emergency food reactions over a 10-year period. This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children presenting to Ume√• University hospital , Sweden , with an emergency food reaction from January 1 , 2006 to December 31 , 2015. Cases were identified using discharge codes for allergies and anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis cases were included if they fulfilled the international criteria. We found emergency food allergy reactions in 519 children ( 58 % boys) from 2006-2015 at a median age of 1.3 years. One-third were hospitalised ( 32 %) including 71/99 cases of anaphylaxis. Milk and eggs were the most commonly identified triggers. Emergency reactions to eggs increased during the study period with a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.770 ( p < 0.01) and the figures for anaphylaxis were 0.745 ( p = 0.013). The incidence of food-induced anaphylaxis increased and was 30 per 100 000 person-years for the study period. Most of the emergency reactions , treated by secondary care paediatricians and emergency physicians , were to milk and eggs. Allergic reactions to eggs increased from 2006 to 2015 , as did food-related anaphylaxis.
