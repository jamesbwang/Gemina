  Cobalt-containing spinel oxides are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) owing to their remarkable activity and durability. However , the activity still needs further improvement and related fundamentals remain untouched. The fact that spinel oxides tend to form cation deficiencies can differentiate their electrocatalysis from other oxide materials , for example , the most studied oxygen-deficient perovskites. Here , a systematic study of spinel ZnFe
