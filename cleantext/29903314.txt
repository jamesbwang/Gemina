  To investigate the contents of antimony in Nandan food , and to research the effects of dietary pathways that mining surrounding usual 's heavy metal intake due to mining activities. Based on the data from weighing method and chemical analysis method , the dietary exposure level of antimony in Nandan was calculated , and the safety of antimony intake was evaluated by the TDI established by WHO. A total of 864 samples from 14 food categories were analyzed. The total detection rate was 97. 2 %. And antimony concentrations in food ranged from not detected to 1. 750 μg/g , with median and geometric means of 0. 007 and 0. 008 μg/g , respectively. Dietary intakes of Sb by inhabitants in Nandan were below the TDI. The mainresource of antimony was meat which contributed 64. 4 % and 61. 2 % of the exposure. Antimony exposure to the human health risk assessmentresult show that , through diet of antimony intake , it would not cause obvious health risk to the local resident. However , the mining residents higher than the contrast areas residents , and male are apparently higher than those in female. The dietary of Sb exposure level was safe in general. However , the meat had a high risk to the residents.
