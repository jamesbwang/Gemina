  Identifying the abnormally high-risk regions in a spatiotemporal space that contains an unexpected disease count is helpful to conduct surveillance and implement control strategies. The EigenSpot algorithm has been recently proposed for detecting space-time disease clusters of arbitrary shapes with no restriction on the distribution and quality of the data , and has shown some promising advantages over the state-of-the-art methods. However , the main problem with the EigenSpot method is that it can not be adapted to detect more than one spatiotemporal hotspot. This is an important limitation , since , in reality , we may have multiple hotspots , sometimes at the same level of importance. We propose an extension of the EigenSpot algorithm , called Multi-EigenSpot that is able to handle multiple hotspots by iteratively removing previously detected hotspots and re-running the algorithm until no more hotspots are found. In addition , a visualization tool ( heatmap) has been linked to the proposed algorithm to visualize multiple clusters with different colors. We evaluated the proposed method using the monthly data on measles<pathogen> cases in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa , Pakistan ( Jan 2016- Dec 2016) , and the efficiency was compared with the state-of-the-art methods: EigenSpot and Space-time scan statistic ( SaTScan). The results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method for detecting multiple clusters in a spatiotemporal space.
