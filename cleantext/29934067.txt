  Oral and maxillofacial metastatic tumors are uncommon , with the breast , prostate , lung , and kidney representing the most common primary sites. Less than 1 % of all breast cancers occur in male patients , and to date , only 8 cases of metastatic breast adenocarcinoma to the oral and maxillofacial region in a male patient have been reported in the literature. An 88-year-old male with previous history of a successfully treated primary breast adenocarcinoma 12 years earlier was referred for evaluation of an oral swelling lasting 6 months. Intraoral examination revealed a 2-cm reddish , pedunculated nodule<disease> with a smooth surface located in the left retromolar region. Imaging revealed maxillary sinus involvement. The patient underwent incisional biopsy , and microscopic evaluation revealed invasive tumor islands compounded by malignant epithelial cells , sometimes exhibiting ductal arrangement , which were positive for the estrogen receptor and gross cystic disease<disease> fluid protein 15. The final diagnosis was metastatic breast adenocarcinoma. Breast metastases are exceedingly rare in the oral and maxillofacial region of male patients; however , clinicians should consider breast metastasis when evaluating reddish oral nodules<disease> in older patients , including men , especially those with a history of malignancy.
