  Nursing history is replete with examples of heroic individuals acting courageously to meet the needs of vulnerable patients and communities. Heroism exemplifies the pinnacle of self-actualised behaviour. It fuels the plots of countless human stories , and enthrals and inspires people. Yet , heroism may be seen as an extreme behaviour that only exceptional individuals are capable of enacting , and may thus be seen as out of reach for ordinary nurses , and something that could be risky to teach and disseminate. An alternative view is that altruistic professions such as nursing are often regarded as being heroic by nature , and that nurses therefore need to be encouraged to understand , deepen and exercise their potential through a recognition of acts of heroism in nursing- whether these can be classed as exceptional or everyday acts of nursing heroism. The purpose of this article is to provide a thematic review of the literature on heroism in nursing , in order to understand how recent research in heroism science is being , or could be , applied to the nursing discipline. Heroism science is an emerging research area that is of interest to nursing leaders , educators and all those seeking to advance the social change agenda in healthcare. A literature review was undertaken in 2017 using CINAHL , PUBMED , Cochrane , Medline , and Google Scholar. The search was limited to papers that were peer reviewed , in English , and published in the last ten years. Four books and 33 papers were identified. Gaining a clear understanding of what constitutes a hero and heroism is essential to applying heroism to nursing and to education of students so they are inspired to act courageously.
