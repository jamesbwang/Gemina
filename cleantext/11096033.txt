  In hemodialysis ( HD) patients , xerostomia and hyposalivation may intensify sensations of thirst , and contribute to the intake of fluids and excessive inter-dialytic weight gain ( IWG). Since IWG is regarded to be higher in diabetic patients than in non-diabetics HD enhancing their mortality , it is crucial to define plausible underlying causes. Therefore , the study investigates factors contributing to the increased IWG in diabetic HD patients. The study included 97 HD patients ( 38 diabetics) receiving hemodialysis. All participants completed surveys comprising the Dialysis Thirst Inventory ( DTI) and Xerostomia Inventory. Unstimulated whole saliva flow rate ( USWFR) was measured , with USWFR below 0.1 mL/min being regarded as hyposalivation. Additionally , pre- and post-dialysis serum sodium concentration , sodium gradient and IWG were assessed. In diabetic HD patients , hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c) level was measured. Significantly higher scores were found in diabetic than non-diabetic HD patients with regard to DTI ( 21.2 ± 7.7 vs. 17.1 ± 6.2: Z = 2.44 , p = 0.03) and xerostomia ( 40.5 ± 6.1 vs. 29.9 ± 14.4: Z = 4.15 , p = 0.003). Hyposalivation was observed more often in diabetic HD patients ( Z = 2.23 , p = 0.04). IGW was significantly higher in participants with diabetes ( Z = 2.44 , p = 0.03) , as was the pre-dialysis sodium serum ( Z = 3.4 , p = 0.008). High levels of HbA1c were associated with lower levels of serum sodium ( r = -0.67 p < 0.05). HbA1c positively correlated with pre-dialysis sodium gradient ( r = 0.66 p < 0.05). However , multiple regression analysis found that the only predictors of increased IWG ( > 4.8 IWG %) in diabetic patients remained saliva flow rate and pre-dialysis sodium gradient. Concomitant diabetes in hemodialysis patients appears to intensify subjective xerostomia and thirst sensation. It also leads to excessive IWG by the increase of pre-dialysis serum sodium gradient.
