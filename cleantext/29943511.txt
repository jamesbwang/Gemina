  Melatonin is an important factor involved in regulating reproduction; it is synthesized enzymatically by the sequential action of melatonin-synthesizing enzymes , arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase ( AANAT) and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase ( HIOMT) , and exerts its biological functions mainly through receptor-mediated action. To evaluate the expression of melatonin , two melatonin-synthesizing enzymes ( HIOMT and AANAT) , and membrane receptors ( MT1 and MT2) in oestrous corpus luteum ( CL) and CL verum of sheep ( Ovis aries) , we performed ELISA , qRT-PCR , western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The quantitative results showed that melatonin , HIOMT and AANAT levels in the CL verum were significantly higher than those in oestrous CL ( p < 0.05) , whereas MT1 and MT2 exhibited no change between the oestrous CL and CL verum ( p > 0.05); moreover , the localization results showed that HIOMT , AANAT , MT1 and MT2 were mainly expressed in large luteal cells ( LLCs). In summary , the above results suggested that sheep CL has potential for the synthesis of melatonin; meanwhile , they also suggested that CL is one of the targets of melatonin. These results provide not only a basis for whether sheep CL can synthesize melatonin but also provide a reference for further study on the mechanism of melatonin in the CL.
