  BACKGROUND Synovitis<symptom> is an important disease that cause intractable pain in temporomandibular joint ( TMJ) , and the inflammation<symptom> process played a crucial role in the initiation and development of temporomandibular joint disorder. A series of investigations suggested that the increasing expression of interleukin- ( IL) 1β secreted by synovial lining cells plays an important role in synovial inflammation<symptom> and cartilage destruction in TMJ. In this present study , we investigated the signaling pathways which regulate the expression of IL-1β. MATERIAL AND METHODS The occlusal interference animal model was created to induce synovial injury. Forty-eight rats were divided into 4 groups: 1) control group , 2) occlusal interference group , 3) TAK-242 ( a specific inhibitor targeting the Toll-like receptor ( TLR) -4) group , and 4) SB203580 ( a specific inhibitor targeting the p38) group. The inflammation<symptom> changes were observed , and the expression of p38 and IL-1β in the synovial membranes<symptom> were assayed. RESULTS The results showed that downstream p38 MAPK ( mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling was triggered following the activation of TLR4. Moreover , the injection of SB203580 could inhibit the inflammatory reactions and the increased expression of IL-1β at both mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSIONS The results prompted us that TLR4 may stimulates synovial inflammatory reactions and increased expression of IL-1β in rats through the activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway , p38 was an important mediator in the mechanisms of the initiation and development of synovial injury by regulating the expression of IL-1β in synovial
