  Dysregulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing ( AS) is closely associated with cancers. However , the relationships between the AS and classic oncogenes/tumor suppressors are largely unknown. Here we show that the deletion of tumor suppressor PTEN alters pre-mRNA splicing in a phosphatase-independent manner , and identify 262 PTEN-regulated AS events in 293T cells by RNA sequencing , which are associated with significant worse outcome of cancer patients. Based on these findings , we report that nuclear PTEN interacts with the splicing machinery , spliceosome , to regulate its assembly and pre-mRNA splicing. We also identify a new exon 2b in GOLGA2 transcript and the exon exclusion contributes to PTEN knockdown-induced tumorigenesis by promoting dramatic Golgi extension and secretion , and PTEN depletion significantly sensitizes cancer cells to secretion inhibitors brefeldin A and golgicide A. Our results suggest that Golgi secretion inhibitors alone or in combination with PI3K/Akt kinase inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for PTEN-deficient cancers.
