  Herein , ketone-functionalized diblock copolymer nano-objects are prepared by photoinitiated reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer ( RAFT) dispersion polymerization of tert-butyl acrylate ( tBA) using a poly ( diacetone acrylamide) ( PDAAM)- based macromolecular RAFT ( macro-RAFT) agent<pathogen> in ethanol/water ( 60/40 , w/w) at room temperature. A high polymerization rate is observed via the exposure of visible light ( Î»
