  Machine learning is rapidly gaining importance in radiology. It allows for the exploitation of patterns in imaging data and in patient records for a more accurate and precise quantification , diagnosis , and prognosis. Here , we outline the basics of machine learning relevant for radiology , and review the current state of the art , the limitations , and the challenges faced as these techniques become an important building block of precision medicine. Furthermore , we discuss the roles machine learning can play in clinical routine and research and predict how it might change the field of radiology.
