  Surfactants have the potential to modify the environmental behavior of hydrophobic pesticides leading to an enhanced or reduced mobility risk. This risk is often overlooked in registration procedures due to a lack of suitable methodologies to quantify the transport potential of pesticides with surfactants. In this study we present a novel methodology designed to study the surfactant facilitated transport of pesticides under controlled equilibrium and dynamic hydrologic conditions. Using this methodology , we investigated the risk of chlorpyrifos enhanced mobility for two common surfactant application practices in agrosystems: pesticide spraying and irrigation with waste water. With the dynamic experiments we showed that a single irrigation event with artificial reclaimed water containing the nonionic surfactant Triton X100 at a concentration of 15 mg/L reduced the leaching of chlorpyrifos by 20 % while the presence of the same surfactant in the chlopyrifos spraying formulation reduced the leaching amount by 60 %. However , in the first case 90 % of the chlropyrifos fraction remaining in soil was retained in the upper 3 cm while in the second cas , 72 % was transported to the bottom layers. The presence of Triton X100 in irrigation water or spraying formulation retards the leaching of chlorpyrifos but enhances its downward transport.
