  Disinfection by UV radiation is one of the most promising solutions to reduce the bacterial load and antibiotic resistance in the final effluents of urban wastewater treatment plants ( UWTP). Our aim was to evaluate the fate of cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase ( ESBL) producers in a full-scale system that includes UV-C disinfection. Over treatment , the abundance of cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae was reduced , with reductions of 1.9 log units after secondary treatment ( STW samples) and 1.8 log following UV disinfection ( UTW samples). These reductions , did not reflect the variations in the prevalence of cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae , estimated to be of 3 % in raw wastewater ( RW) , 18 % in STW and 3 % in UTW. A significant increase of cefotaxime-resistant bacterial counts ( 0.5 log; p < 0.05) was observed after 3 days of storage. In a total of 1799 cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates , 15 % harboured bla
