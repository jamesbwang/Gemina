  Transition metal dichalcogenides ( TMDCs) have recently become spotlighted as nanomaterials for future electronic and optoelectronic devices. In this work , we develop an effective approach to enhance the electronic and optoelectronic performances of WSe2-based devices by N2O plasma treatment. The hole mobility and sheet density increase by 2 and 5 orders of magnitude , reaching 110 cm2 V-1 s-1 and 2.2 × 1012 cm-2 , respectively , after the treatment. At the same time , the contact resistance ( Rc) between WSe2 and its metal electrode drop by 5 orders of magnitude from 1.0 GΩ μm to 28.4 kΩ μm. The WSe2 photoconductor exhibits superior performance with high responsivity ( 1.5 × 105 A W-1) , short response time ( < 2 ms) , high detectivity ( 3.6 × 1013 Jones) and very large photoconductive gain ( > 106). We have also built a lateral p-n junction on a single piece of WSe2 flake by selective plasma exposure. The junction reaches an exceedingly high rectifying ratio of 106 , an excellent photoresponsivity of 2.49 A W-1 and a fast response of 8 ms. The enhanced optoelectronic performance is attributed to band-engineering through the N2O plasma treatment , which can potentially serve as an effective and versatile approach for device engineering and optimization in a wide range of electronic and optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials.
