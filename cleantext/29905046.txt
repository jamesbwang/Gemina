  To explore the effectiveness of high strength suture fixation in treatment of patellar transverse fracture. Between June 2014 and June 2016 , 38 patients with the patellar transverse fracture were treated with high strength suture internal fixation. There were 24 males and 14 females with the age of 26 to 64 years ( mean , 45 years). There were 6 cases of accident injury and 32 cases of crashing injury. The time interval between injury and surgery was 2-8 days ( mean , 5 days). The preoperative visual analogue scale ( VAS) score , Lysholm score , and range of motion ( ROM) of patients were 84.3 ± 8.4 , 44.5 ± 7.2 , and ( 62 ± 12) ° , respectively. All patients ' incisions healed by first intention after operation. There was no neurovascular injury , deep venous thrombosis of lower limbs , or local foreign matter irritation reaction. The X-ray films showed that the reduction of patella and the location of internal fixator were good at 2 days after operation. All the 38 patients were followed up 12-18 months ( mean , 16 months). All fractures healed and the healing time was 2-4 months ( mean , 3 months). At last follow-up , according to the Böstman criteria , 36 patients were rated as excellent and 2 as good , with an excellent and good rate of 100 %. The VAS score , Lysholm score , and ROM of patients were 10.2 ± 6.6 , 93.1 ± 6.4 , and ( 124 ± 14) ° , respectively , showing significant differences when compared with preoperative ones ( Application of high strength suture fixation in the treatment of patellar transverse fracture has advantages of simple to operate , effective fixation , and less complication. It can avoid reoperation of removing the internal fixators. The satisfied ROM and function of the knee joint can be obtained after operation.
