  Due to their pseudo-persistence and their biological activity , pharmaceuticals are emerging contaminants of major concern for the environment. The aim of this review is to provide an updated inventory of the contamination of aquatic environments by 43 drugs representing different classes of pharmaceuticals , such as antibiotics , anti-inflammatory drugs , anti-depressants , sex hormones , lipid regulators and beta-blockers. The data collected is focused on contamination levels reported in marine coastal waters and in waste and river waters flowing into the Mediterranean Sea. The most widely produced/prescribed classes of medicines are compared with the substances most widely searched for in the environment. Ranges of pollution levels according to the type of water body are also presented , to examine the fate in sewage treatment plants and the persistence in the environment of the targeted molecules. Levels of pharmaceuticals ranged from 100 to 10,000 or even 100,000 ng Â· L
