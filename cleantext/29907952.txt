  The third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI) osimertinib ( AZD9291) has shown significant clinical efficacy against the EGFR T790M mutation in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) patients. However , resistance inevitably occurs , and the mechanisms leading to treatment failure need to be further investigated. The B-cell lymphoma 2 ( BCL-2)- like 11 ( BIM) deletion polymorphism , which occurs at a frequency of 21 % in East Asians but is absent in African and European populations , has been associated with resistance to first-generation EGFR TKIs , such as gefitinib and erlotinib; and is a poor prognostic factor for NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations. Nevertheless , the significance of this BIM deletion polymorphism in the resistance to osimertinib has not been reported. Here , we show for the first time that a NSCLC patient harboring the EGFR L858R/T790M mutations , as well as the BIM deletion polymorphism , exhibited poor clinical outcomes with osimertinib treatment. This result suggests that the BIM deletion polymorphism might have prognostic value for determining NSCLC patient outcomes following osimertinib treatment.
