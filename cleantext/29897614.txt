  Trim27 ( Zinc finger protein RFP) is a potential regulator of hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC) , yet its role in hematopoiesis remains elusive. Here , we investigated the roles of Trim27 in hematopoiesis by enforcing its expression in mouse and human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPC). Ectopic expression of Trim27 in mouse fetal liver ( FL) HSPC confers repopulating advantage with myeloid dominance. However , the number of HSC from Trim27 group was comparable with empty vector control group , indicating that overexpression of Trim27 unlikely expanded HSC. Transcriptome analysis of Trim27-overexpressing myeloid progenitor cells ( MP) indicated that Trim27 up-regulated essential regulators of myelopoiesis , including Spi1 and Cebpg , up-regulated myeloid proliferation-related signaling genes Nras , Runx1 , and Cbfb , up-regulated JAK/STAT signaling inhibitors Socs2 , Socs3 , and Cish , and up-regulated myeloid maturation-related genes Adam8 and Dek. Moreover , the myeloproliferative advantage caused by overexpressing Trim27/TRIM27 is conserved between mouse and human hematopoiesis. To our knowledge , this is the first study showing that Trim27 confers competitive hematopoiesis by promoting myeloid bias differentiation of HSPC , but not by expanding HSC.
