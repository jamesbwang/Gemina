  The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT) for determining cortical thickness and the gray value , investigating its correlation with micro-computed tomography ( CT) and histology analysis. Sixty-two bone samples from 4 anatomic regions of the jaw were analyzed. A radiographic surgical stent was used during CBCT and bone sample harvesting. The cortical thickness and gray value of the planned implant were evaluated by CBCT. Bone volumetric fractions , bone mineral density , and % porosity assessed by micro-CT and mineralized material by histology analysis from harvested bone samples were analyzed and assessed for the association with the CBCT using Pearson correlation. A correlation between cortical thickness measured from the CBCT and Micro-CT ( r = 0.933 , P < 0.01) was identified. There was no difference between gray values measured from the CBCT among regions , while bone density parameters from micro-CT and histologic analysis showed significant difference ( P < 0.01) among regions. Bone density parameters from micro-CT and histologic analysis showed correlation with cortical thickness but not with the gray value. In conclusion , CBCT is highly accurate in linear measurements and demonstrated correlation with genuine bone density. However , the gray value could not demonstrate the true bone density according to a low correlation to bone density variable measured from micro-CT and histologic analysis.
