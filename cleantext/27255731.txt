  The latest multimodal protocols for treatment of bladder/prostate rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS) have shifted the goal of treatment from patient survival to bladder preservation. Consistently , partial resections , such as radical prostatectomy ( RP) , are favoured when surgery is deemed necessary. We sought to determine the oncological risks- that is , failure to achieve disease control- and the possible benefits in terms of urinary continence associated with RP in RMS patients based on a review of our experience and the data reported in the literature. We identified 18 children undergoing RP for RMS ( 3 at our institution , 15 in the literature). In five cases , a pubectomy/symphisiotomy was performed to improve surgical exposure. Two cases experienced local relapse , suggesting that this approach can be viable to achieve local control. No clear-cut indications could be extrapolated from the literature , however , to determine how to select the patients most suitable for this approach. We offered this treatment to patients with evidence of disease localized only within the prostate on radiological and endoscopic re-assessment after chemo-/ radio-therapy. Eight of the 18 cases ( 44 %) eventually required lower urinary tract reconstruction , suggesting that often this approach does not allow for the preservation of urinary continence with volitional voiding. Finally , data about additional interesting outcomes such as erectile function and fertility in RMS patients undergoing RP are extremely sparse.
