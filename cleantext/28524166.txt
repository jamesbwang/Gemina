  Rapid , efficient generation of knock-in mice with targeted large insertions remains a major hurdle in mouse genetics. Here , we describe two-cell homologous recombination ( 2C-HR)- CRISPR , a highly efficient gene-editing method based on introducing CRISPR reagents into embryos at the two-cell stage , which takes advantage of the open chromatin structure and the likely increase in homologous-recombination efficiency during the long G2 phase. Combining 2C-HR-CRISPR with a modified biotin-streptavidin approach to localize repair templates to target sites , we achieved a more-than-tenfold increase ( up to 95 %) in knock-in efficiency over standard methods. We targeted 20 endogenous genes expressed in blastocysts with fluorescent reporters and generated reporter mouse lines. We also generated triple-color blastocysts with all three lineages differentially labeled , as well as embryos carrying the two-component auxin-inducible degradation system for probing protein function. We suggest that 2C-HR-CRISPR is superior to random transgenesis or standard genome-editing protocols , because it ensures highly efficient insertions at endogenous loci and defined ` safe harbor ' sites.
