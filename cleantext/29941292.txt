  Forty years ago the advent of Sanger sequencing was revolutionary as it allowed complete genome sequences to be deciphered for the first time. A second revolution came when next-generation sequencing ( NGS) technologies appeared , which made genome sequencing much cheaper and faster. However , NGS methods have several drawbacks and pitfalls , most notably their short reads. Recently , third-generation/long-read methods appeared , which can produce genome assemblies of unprecedented quality. Moreover , these technologies can directly detect epigenetic modifications on native DNA and allow whole-transcript sequencing without the need for assembly. This marks the third revolution in sequencing technology. Here we review and compare the various long-read methods. We discuss their applications and their respective strengths and weaknesses<symptom> and provide future perspectives.
