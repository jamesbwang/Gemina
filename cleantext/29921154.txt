  Objective To investigate the influence of Msx2 conditional gene knockout during lens development in mice. Methods Lens-specific Msx2 knockout mice were generated using the Cre-loxP system. The eyes of Msx2 conditional knockout ( Msx2CKO) and wild-type ( Msx2WT) mice were examined during embryonic and early postnatal periods using histological , immunofluorescence , in situ hybridization , cell proliferation , apoptosis , and mRNA microarray analyses. Results Msx2CKO mice exhibited small lens formation and microphthalmia after birth , while Msx2CKO embryos exhibited a persistent lens stalk , small lens formation , and microphthalmia. Conditional deletion of Msx2 also led to an increased apoptosis rate , a significant reduction in FoxE3 expression , and an upregulation of Prox1 expression in the lens vesicle during the early embryonic period. Microarray comparison of Msx2CKO and Msx2WT lens transcriptomes identified a large number of differentially expressed genes. Real-time PCR showed that Casp8 and Casp3 expression was upregulated in Msx2CKO mice at post-natal day 1. Conclusion The activation of apoptosis through the caspase-8/ caspase-3 signaling pathway , together with the downregulation of FoxE3 expression , appeared to account for the smaller lens formation in Msx2CKO mice.
