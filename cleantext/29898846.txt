  Vitamin K antagonists ( VKAs) reduce cardiovascular events ( CVEs) in atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( AF) when a time in therapeutic range ( TiTR) > 70 % is achieved. Factors affecting the time to achieve the TR ( TtTR) are unknown. Prospective observational study including 1,406 nonvalvular AF patients starting VKAs followed for a mean of 31.3 months ( 3,690 patient/year); TiTR , TtTR , and SAMe-TT Median TtTR was 8.0 days ( interquartile range 5.0-18.0). Patients with high TtTR ( ie , > 75th percentile) were more likely to be in AF than in sinus rhythm at entry ( odds ratio ( OR): 1.423 , P = .011). Median TiTR was 60.0 %; low TiTR ( below median) was associated with SAMe-TT High TtTR is associated with poorer long-term quality of VKAs therapy. Patients with TtTR > 18days or with high SAMe-TT
