  We identify temporal investor networks for Nokia stock by constructing networks from correlations between investor-specific net-volumes and analyze changes in the networks around dot-com bubble. The analysis is conducted separately for households , financial , and non-financial institutions. Our results indicate that spanning tree measures for households reflected the boom and crisis: the maximum spanning tree measures had a clear upward tendency in the bull markets when the bubble was building up , and , even more importantly , the minimum spanning tree measures pre-reacted the burst of the bubble. At the same time , we find less clear reactions in the minimal and maximal spanning trees of non-financial and financial institutions around the bubble , which suggests that household investors can have a greater herding tendency around bubbles.
