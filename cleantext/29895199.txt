  Double-strand breaks ( DSBs) are repaired through two major pathways , homology-directed recombination ( HDR) and non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ). The choice between these two pathways is largely influenced by cell cycle phases. HDR can occur only in S/G2 when sister chromatid can provide homologous templates , whereas NHEJ can take place in all phases of the cell cycle except mitosis. Central to NHEJ repair is the Ku70/80 heterodimer which forms a ring structure that binds DSB ends and serves as a platform to recruit factors involved in NHEJ. Upon completion of NHEJ repair , DNA double strand-encircling Ku dimers have to be removed. The removal depends on ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of Ku80 by the ubiquitin E3 ligases RNF8. Here we report that RNF8 is a substrate of APC
