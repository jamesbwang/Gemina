  Appetite<symptom> regulating properties of foods are usually investigated under laboratory conditions , whereas in real life , foods are consumed under at home conditions. The objective of this study was to compare the acute effects of breakfasts when tested in a laboratory condition and in an at home condition. Appetite<symptom> regulating properties of two bread breakfasts and two cereal breakfasts were also compared. In this randomized cross-over trial balanced for laboratory and at home test conditions , thirty-two women consumed five breakfasts , i.e. two bread breakfasts , two cereal breakfasts and one fried-egg breakfast. Visual analogue scales for measuring appetite<symptom> were captured via an on-line scoring system and were analyzed as incremental area under the curve , as satiation phase and as satiety phase. Location effects were limited to two small effects only. An overall location effect in hunger feelings was observed ( p = 0.040) , which occurred specifically during the short satiation period ( p = 0.0002) where hunger feelings scored higher under laboratory conditions. Similarly , a location effect was observed for desire to eat ( p = 0.001); this was again higher under laboratory conditions. No other location effects were observed. Bread breakfasts did not differ in their appetite<symptom> regulating properties. The Steel Cut oatmeal breakfast was reported to be more satiating ( p = 0.001) as compared to the ready-to-eat cereal. Whereas the five breakfasts varied somewhat in their appetite<symptom> regulating properties , evaluation under laboratory conditions overall did not result in different appetite<symptom> scores compared to the at home conditions. This suggests that at home testing may be a useful alternative to laboratory test conditions for nutrition research.
