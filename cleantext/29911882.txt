  The current research investigates people 's perceptions of others ' lay theories ( or mindsets) , an understudied construct that we call meta-lay theories. Six studies examine whether underrepresented students ' meta-lay theories influence their sense of belonging to science , technology , engineering , and math ( STEM). The studies tested whether underrepresented students who perceive their faculty as believing most students have high scientific aptitude ( a universal metatheory) would report a stronger sense of belonging to STEM than those who think their faculty believe that not everyone has high scientific aptitude ( a nonuniversal metatheory). Women PhD candidates in STEM fields who held universal rather than nonuniversal metatheories felt greater sense of belonging to their field , both when metatheories were measured ( Study 1) and manipulated ( Study 2). Undergraduates who held more universal metatheories reported a higher sense of belonging to STEM ( Studies 3 and 4) and earned higher final course grades ( Study 3). Experimental manipulations depicting a professor communicating the universal lay theory eliminated the difference between African American and European American students ' attraction to a STEM course ( Study 5) and between women and men 's sense of belonging to STEM ( Study 6). Mini<pathogen> meta-analyses indicated that the universal metatheory increases underrepresented students ' sense of belonging to STEM , reduces the extent of social identity threat they experience , and reduces their perception of faculty as endorsing stereotypes. Across different underrepresented groups , types of institutions , areas of STEM , and points in the STEM pipeline , students ' metaperceptions of faculty 's lay theories about scientific aptitude influence their sense of belonging to STEM.
