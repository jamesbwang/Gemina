  Chlamydia<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> , an obligate intracellular human pathogen , is a major cause of sexually transmitted diseases. Infections often occur without symptoms , a feature that has been attributed to the ability of the pathogen to evade the host immune response. We show here that C.<pathogen> trachomatis<pathogen> paralyses the host immune system by preventing the activation of polymorphic nuclear leukocytes ( PMNs). PMNs infected with Chlamydia<pathogen> fail to produce neutrophil extracellular traps and the bacteria are able to survive in PMNs for extended periods of time. We have identified the secreted chlamydial protease-like activating factor ( CPAF) as an effector mediating the evasion of the innate immune response since CPAF-deficient Chlamydia<pathogen> activate PMNs and are subsequently efficiently killed. CPAF suppresses the oxidative burst and interferes with chemical-mediated activation of neutrophils. We identified formyl peptide receptor 2 ( FPR2) as a target of CPAF. FPR2 is cleaved by CPAF and released from the surface of PMNs. In contrast to previously described subversion mechanisms that mainly act on already activated PMNs , we describe here details of how Chlamydia<pathogen> actively paralyses PMNs , including the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps , to evade the host 's innate immune response.
