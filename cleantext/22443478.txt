  Data on the incidence , characteristics , and treatment of thrombosis of a transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI) implant are scarce. We report a challenging case of a TAVI thrombosis occurring 6 months after the procedure. Initial anticoagulation using low-molecular-weight heparin followed by thrombolytic therapy failed to both relieve symptoms and alleviate thrombosis. However , the condition of the patient deteriorated rapidly , necessitating the use of balloon valvuloplasty followed by low-dose thrombolysis. The uniqueness of the case can be summarized as follows: ( 1) first report of balloon valvuloplasty to manage a case of TAVI thrombosis; ( 2) thrombolytic therapy after balloon valvuloplasty was successful to further reduce gradient from valve thrombosis.
