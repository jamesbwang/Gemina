  Challenges of Digital Medicine Abstract. Digitization is increasingly covering more and more sectors , including medicine. To ensure medical operation 365 Ã— 24 hours , progressively more human and financial resources are necessary. The transformation of patient histories from paper into electronic patient records focused initially on documentation. Today , hospital information systems are increasingly used as a platform for the communication of all professionals involved in the patient process- in Switzerland , however , so far without providing patients direct access to their data.

The introduction of the electronic patient record in Switzerland in 2020 is expected to provide cross-company , more complete documentation of patient care. Multimorbid patients , often treated in different institutions and by different specialists , should benefit from this in particular. Advances in artificial intelligence offer new opportunities in medicine. Challenges include ensuring reliable data protection , and better interoperability of the systems involved. Semantically structured , machine-readable data exchange is a necessity for both networked services and internationally competitive research.
