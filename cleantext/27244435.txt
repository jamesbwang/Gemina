  The brightness of the artificial beacon is one critical performance parameter for adaptive optics. Here , a 40-watt level narrow-linewidth microsecond pulsed yellow laser is produced at 589 nm with a high repetition frequency of 600 Hz and a pulse duration of 120 Î¼s. An experiment to project the pulse beam up to the sky and measure the fluorescence photon returns of the Na atoms has been held on the 1.8-meter telescope in Lijiang observatory. During the sky test , a laser guide star ( LGS) spot is firstly observed with Rayleigh scattering elimination by means of a gateable pulse format. And , the central wavelength of the laser could be accurately locked to be 589.1584 nm with a linewidth of ~ 0.34 GHz to match that of sodium-D
