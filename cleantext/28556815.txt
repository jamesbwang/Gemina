  A growing body of evidence suggests a protective role of polyphenols and exercise training on the disorders of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM). We aimed to assess the effect of the açaí seed extract ( ASE) associated with exercise training on diabetic complications induced by high-fat ( HF) diet plus streptozotocin ( STZ) in rats. Type 2 diabetes was induced by feeding rats with HF diet ( 55 % fat) for 5 weeks and a single dose of STZ ( 35 mg/kg i.p.). Control ( C) and Diabetic ( D) animals were subdivided into four groups each: Sedentary , Training , ASE Sedentary , and ASE Training. ASE ( 200 mg/kg/day) was administered by gavage and the exercise training was performed on a treadmill ( 30min/day; 5 days/week) for 4 weeks after the diabetes induction. In type 2 diabetic rats , the treatment with ASE reduced blood glucose , insulin resistance , leptin and IL-6 levels , lipid profile , and vascular dysfunction. ASE increased the expression of insulin signaling proteins in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and plasma GLP-1 levels. ASE associated with exercise training potentiated the reduction of glycemia by decreasing TNF-α levels , increasing pAKT and adiponectin expressions in adipose tissue , and IR and pAMPK expressions in skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic rats. In conclusion , ASE treatment has an antidiabetic effect in type 2 diabetic rats by activating the insulin-signaling pathway in muscle and adipose tissue , increasing GLP-1 levels , and an anti-inflammatory action. Exercise training potentiates the glucose-lowering effect of ASE by activating adiponectin-AMPK pathway and increasing IR expression.
