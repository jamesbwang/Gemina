  Our previous study demonstrated the translocation of Aβ1-42 to the nucleus in response to antibiotic treatment , and interpreted it as a possible transcriptional response of Aβ1-42 to antibiotics. The present study aims to investigate how amyloid acts on the key elements of neurodegeneration and the molecules involved in the induction of Aβ1-42 production. For this purpose , we investigated the acute effect of Aβ1-42 on the transcriptional levels of genes that have roles in the mechanisms that produce Aβ itself: alpha secretase ( ADAM10) , beta secretase ( BACE1) , the gamma secretase complex ( PS-1 , PS-2 , Nicastrin) , the substrate APP , APOE ( the significant risk factor for sporadic form of the AD) , TREM2 ( recently indicated as a contributor to AD risk) , NMDAR subunits and PKCzeta ( contributors of memory and learning) , and key elements of tau pathology such as tau , GSK3α , GSK3β , and Cdk5. Additionally , we examined cholecalciferol metabolism-related enzyme 1α-hydroxylase ( 1αOHase) in primary cortical neurons with qRT-PCR. Our results indicate that Aβ1-42 has an effect on most of the target genes. This effect involves regulation of the amyloidogenic pathway in a complex manner , specifically , a general downregulation in NMDARs , ApoE , Trem2 , and 1αOHase genes , and general up-regulation of tau pathway-related genes. We speculate that the presence of Aβ impacts the neurons not only with toxic events but also at the transcriptional level. The nuclear localization of Aβ1-42 and its regulatory effects on the target genes that we investigated in present study indicates Aβ1-42 as a transcriptional regulator of genes related to neurodegeneration.
