  The mitral valve may be accessed directly through the left atrium but visualisation can sometimes be challenging. A trans-septal interatrial approach provides better exposure and easy access for concomitant tricuspid procedures especially in difficult cases. This retrospective study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the extended vertical trans-septal approach ( EVTSA) for routine mitral valve exposure. 1017 consecutive patients undergoing an isolated primary mitral valve procedure ( repair/replacement) through a median sternotomy were retrospectively studied between 2000 and 2015. Up to 135 patients were operated by EVTSA ( group A) while 882 patients underwent a traditional left atrial<symptom> ( LA , group B) approach. There were 135 patients ( M/F = 56/79) in group A and 882 patients ( M/F = 398/484) in group B. Logistic EuroSCORE was significantly lower in EVTSA group ( 0.61 vs 0.90 , p = 0.000001). In the LA group there were more patients with preoperative transient ischaemic attack or stroke ( 94 vs 6 , p = 0.005). Cumulative cross-clamp time was 82 ( 44-212) min ( EVTSA group) and 78 ( 30-360) min ( LA group) ( p = 0.271) while cardiopulmonary bypass time was 107 ( 58-290) and 114 ( 43-602) min , respectively ( p = 0.121). Postoperative blood<symptom> loss<symptom> was 415 mL ( EVTSA) vs 427 mL ( LA) ( p = 0.273). No significant difference was found in the incidence of postoperative atrial<symptom> fibrillation<symptom> ( p = 0.22) or heart block requiring permanent pacemaker ( p = 0.14). In our opinion , EVTSA to the mitral valve is safe and reproducible. It gives excellent exposure of the mitral valve under all circumstances without any significant increase in cross-clamp or bypass time , postoperative arrhythmia , heart block/pacemaker rate or bleeding.
