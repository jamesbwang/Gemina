  To what extent do structural and biophysical features of food allergen proteins distinguish them from other proteins in our diet? Invertebrate tropomyosins ( Tpms) as a class are considered `` pan-allergens , '' inducing food allergy to shellfish and respiratory allergy to dust mites. Vertebrate Tpms are not known to elicit allergy or cross-reactivity , despite their high structural similarity and sequence identity to invertebrate homologs. We expect allergens are sufficiently stable against gastrointestinal proteases to survive for immune sensitization in the intestines , and that proteolytic stability will correlate with thermodynamic stability. Thermal denaturation of shrimp<disease> Tpm shows that it is more stable than non-allergen vertebrate Tpm. Shrimp<disease> Tpm is also more resistant to digestion. Molecular dynamics uncover local dynamics that select epitopes and global differences in flexibility between shrimp<disease> and pig Tpm that discriminate allergens from non-allergens. Molecular determinants of allergenicity depend not only on sequence but on contributions of protein structure and dynamics.
