  Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B ( PTP1B) impairs nitric oxide ( NO) production and induces endothelial dysfunction in various diseases , including diabetes , septic shock<symptom> and heart<symptom> failure<symptom>. In non-cardiovascular tissues , PTP1B modulates endoplasmic reticulum stress ( ERS) however this role has never been assessed in endothelial cells. We evaluated the link between PTP1B , ERS and endothelial dysfunction in mice. Induction of ERS ( Tunicamycin) in vivo in mice or ex vivo in mouse arteries led to severe arterial endothelial dysfunction ( i.e. reduced flow-dependent , NO mediated dilatation in isolated small mesenteric arteries) , and this was prevented by the PTP1B inhibitor trodusquemine and absent in PTP1B-/- mice. Trodusquemine also prevented the Tunicamycin- induced increased arterial levels of the molecular ERS actors 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein ( GRP78) and Activating Transcription Factor 6 ( ATF6α). Tunicamycin strongly increased the interactions of PTP1B with GRP78 and the activated forms of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase ( PERK) and IRE1α ( proximity Ligation Assay). Thus , PTP1B plays a central role in the regulation of ERS in the endothelium , and the endothelial protective effect of PTP1B inhibition appears likely due at least in part to reduction of endothelial ERS , notably by promoting PERK protective pathway. Modulation of ER stress via PTP1B inhibitors may be a promising approach to protect the endothelium in cardiovascular diseases.
