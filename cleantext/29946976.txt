  Carotenoid cleavage oxygenases ( CCO) are non-heme iron enzymes that catalyze oxidative cleavage of alkene bonds in carotenoid and stilbenoid substrates. Previously , we showed that the iron cofactor of CAO1 , a resveratrol-cleaving member of this family , can be substituted with cobalt to yield a catalytically inert enzyme useful for trapping active site-bound stilbenoid substrates for structural characterization. Metal substitution may provide a general method for identifying the natural substrates for CCOs in addition to facilitating structural and biophysical characterization of CCO-carotenoid complexes under normal aerobic conditions. Here , we demonstrate the general applicability of cobalt substitution in a prototypical carotenoid cleaving CCO , apocarotenoid oxygenase ( ACO) from Synechocystis. Among the non-native divalent metals investigated , cobalt was uniquely able to stably occupy the ACO metal binding site and inhibit catalysis. Analysis by X-ray crystallography and X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrate that the Co ( II) forms of both ACO and CAO1 exhibit a close structural correspondence to the native Fe ( II) enzyme forms. Hence , cobalt substitution is an effective strategy for generating catalytically inert but structurally intact forms of CCOs.
