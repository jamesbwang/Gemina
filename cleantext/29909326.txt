  The sediment load on the Chinese Loess Plateau has sharply decreased in recent years. However , the contribution of terrace construction and vegetation restoration projects to sediment discharge reduction remains uncertain. In this paper , eight catchments located in the Loess Plateau were chosen to explore the effects of different driving factors on sediment discharge changes during the period from the 1960s to 2012. Attribution approaches were applied to evaluate the effects of climate , terrace , and vegetation coverage changes on sediment discharge. The results showed that the annual sediment discharge decreased significantly in all catchments ranging from -0.007 to -0.039 Gt Â· yr
