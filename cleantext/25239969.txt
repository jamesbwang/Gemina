  To develop and validate the content of the online Questionnaire for Fall Risk Assessment in the Elderly. The instrument was developed based on the International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health ( ICF) of the World Health Organization. Initially , the set of items was submitted to evaluation of judges ( healthcare professionals with experience in elderly health) , who could suggest inclusion or exclusion of questions from the instrument; they were also asked to rate each question according to the expected scope. At this stage , clarity and relevance levels for each item were evaluated , generating a total of Content Validity Coefficient ( CtVC). Content Validity Coefficient values were satisfactory for both clarity ( CtVC = 0.76) and relevance ( CtVC = 0.82) of the questions. Next , a group of elderly volunteers participating in a socializing group evaluated the questionnaire for comprehension. The level of comprehension for each item was identified on a Likert scale , ranging from 0 to 5. The questionnaire was considered easy to understand by most participants ( 95 %) , with a mean of 4.75 ( Â± 0.11) points for each item. The instrument showed acceptable psychometric qualities for screening fall risk among the elderly population. Future studies shall investigate different validation aspects of construct for this measure.
