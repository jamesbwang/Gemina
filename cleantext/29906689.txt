  Moral threats , including threats to moral self-worth , have been associated with contamination concerns. Paradoxically , although self-cleansing provides temporary relief , it can worsen feelings of contamination. Self-affirmation might be an effective strategy , especially following obsessive type cognitions ( e.g. , responsibility beliefs) when moral threats are reactivated. In Experiment 1 , participants recalled an immoral deed and then self-cleansed ( using a hand-wipe) , completed a control task , or self-affirmed. Contamination concerns were subsequently measured by a washing task. In Experiment 2 , the same procedure was used but obsessive-type cognitions were activated by asking participants a series of questions about obsessive beliefs. As expected , relative to the control condition , both self-affirmation and self-cleansing resulted in less subsequent repeated washing behaviour in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2 , when the immoral recall was followed by activation of obsessive-type cognitions , self-cleansing led to more guilt and repeated washing than self-affirmation and control. Rather than alleviating feelings of contamination , physical self-cleansing led to more contamination concerns and guilt when in the context of activated obsessive-type cognitions , possibly because it paradoxically makes ( moral) cleanliness goals salient. Future research needs to test clinical populations , for whom contamination concerns are all the more central. This research provides further evidence of the influence of moral threat in contamination concerns , and the limits of moral cleansing. Self-affirmation resulted in less contamination concerns under both a neutral condition and activated obsessive type cognitions.
