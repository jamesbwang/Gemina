  To explore the relationship between separation from parents and social anxiety<symptom> with aggressive<symptom> behaviors<symptom> , to provide scientific basis for the prevention of aggression. Stratified random sampling was used to collect 1126 students ofthe fourth , fifth and sixth grade from three primary schools in Dangshan County and two primary schools in Guzhen County. The incomplete or incorrect questionnaires were eliminated , and 1024 questionnaires were valid; the effective rate was 90. 9 %. The questionnaire survey included the left-behind children 's general situation and the separation from parents; the aggression questionnaire was used to detect the aggression of students; the social anxiety<symptom> scale for children was used to detect the social anxiety<symptom> of students. The multiple linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between the risk factor and the aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom>. There were no significant difference of AQ score and other factor score among students in different grade ( P > 0. 05) , the AQ score and other factor score were higher in boy students ( P < 0. 05). The AQ score and other factor score of the left-behind children were higher than the children who lived with their parents , the AQ score and other factor score of the children whose parents all out were highest ( 71. 5 ± 20. 5 , 14. 9 ± 6. 1 , 12. 6 ± 3. 2 , 17. 6 ± 5. 8 , 11. 7 ± 4. 3 and15. 4 ± 5. 4) , there were significant difference of AQ score and PHY and IND factor score between them ( P < 0. 05). The children whose parents go out one year ago , whose parents do n't go home in one year , and who hardly contact parents , these children ' AQ score and each factor points are the highest. Multiple linear regression showed that sex , the situation of parents go out to work , the number of parents go back to home every year , the frequency of parent-child links and children 's social society influenced the aggressive<symptom> behavior<symptom> of students ( P < 0. 05). The lower the frequency of parental contact , the longer time to work and the higher the social anxiety<symptom> score of children , the more serious the attack behavior of left-behind children.
