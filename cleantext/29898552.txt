  In this study , long-term column experiments were conducted in three media ( Milli-Q water , fresh groundwater and saline groundwater) to evaluate the trichloroethylene ( TCE) removal performance , electron efficiency ( EE) , and permeability loss of a microscale zero valent iron-based in situ reactive zone ( mZVI-IRZ) under different field conditions. A potential scenario of in situ contamination plume remediation was simulated by adding a TCE-containing influent to columns filled with mixed mZVI particles and silica sand at a flow rate of 4 mL h
