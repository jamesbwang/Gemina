  Multiple hormones are involved in the regulation of food intake and glucose metabolism. Past intervention studies showed a benefit of eating breakfast on satiety , but this was possibly confounded by the disruption of habitual meal patterns. The objective of this study was to compare hormonal responses , including insulin , leptin , glucagon-like peptide-1 , ghrelin , peptide YY ( PYY3-36) , and cholecystokinin ( CCK) , between habitual breakfast eaters ( Br-Es) and habitual skippers ( Br-Ss) to a standard midday meal. Thirty-two women ( mean ± SD age: 22.6 ± 3.3 y; body mass index ( in kg/m2): 21.8 ± 2.0) participated in a cross-sectional study that consisted of a 3-h test protocol that included a standard test meal served at 1230 with pre- and postmeal blood sampling. The protocol required that Br-Es eat a typical breakfast between 0700 and 1000 , whereas Br-Ss had no breakfast meal and had fasted for 12 h. Blood was drawn 35 and 5 min prelunch and 5 , 20 , 35 , 50 , and 110 min postlunch. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a group difference for PYY3-36 ( P = 0.001) , with the Br-E group exhibiting 50-90 % higher concentrations throughout the test period. Leptin tended to be different ( P = 0.08) between groups , with higher mean ± SD values for the Br-S group ( 27.6 ± 29.6 ng/mL) compared with the Br-E group ( 11.5 ± 9.8 ng/mL). Partial least squares regression analysis confirmed that these 2 hormones were important contributors to the patterns of the hormones , anthropometric , clinical , and behavioral variables that differed between groups; insulin and CCK were important as well. We found differences between the Br-E and Br-S groups in circulating gut and adipose-derived hormones measured midday , indicating that the breakfast habit is associated with the hormonal milieu before and after a midday meal. The different patterns may be short-lived or may impact metabolism later in the day. This report is a secondary analysis of a trial registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01427556.
