  The goal of the present study is to summarize our experience on surgical management of retraction pockets ( RP) as a preventive tool against cholesteatomas. Twenty-five ears<disease> have been followed up for a mean period of 6.16 ± 4.35 years ( from 1 to 17 years). The sample presented a mean age of 47.56 ± 19.11 years ( from 16 to 73 years). All patients underwent cartilage graft surgery. Furthermore 10 ( 40 %) underwent tympanoplasty ( TPL) type I , 14 ( 56 %) TPL type II and 1 ( 4 %) TPL type V. Eleven ears<disease> ( 44 %) showed cholesteatoma: all these cases were stage III according to Charachon staging , and stage IV or V according to Gersdorff classification. Twelve patients ( 48 %) showed erosion of the ossicular chain. Of these , five were associated with cholesteatoma and seven only with retraction. The recurrence rate of cholesteatoma was 12 %. None of the patients with a stage II or III RP ( according to Gersdorff classification) developed cholesteatoma. The recurrence of RP was 0 %. In regards to literature review , seven references were selected. These studies showed a success rate ranging from 79.1 % to 88 % , while recurrences of RP varied from 6.4 % to 13 %. Only one study specified a recurrence rate of cholesteatoma of 28 %. Surgical treatment of stages II and III RP is an effective tool to prevent cholesteatoma formation. The presence of keratin accumulation and cholesteatoma at the RP ( stages IV and V , according to Gersdorff) are the real predictors of poor prognosis.
