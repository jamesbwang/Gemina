  Analyzing the recent literature , it seems that the use of irrigation increases the incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses<disease> ( IAAs) and infectious complications in perforated appendicitis<disease> The aim of this study was to compare peritoneal irrigation and suction versus suction only during laparoscopic appendectomy ( LA) for perforated appendicitis<disease> in children. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 699 patients ( 460 boys and 239 girls , average age 9.8 years) who underwent LA for complicated appendicitis<disease> in six international centers of pediatric surgery over a 5-year period. The appendix was perforated with localized peritonitis<disease> in 465 cases and diffuse peritonitis<disease> in 234 patients. Irrigation + suction was used in 488 cases ( group 1 ( G1)) , whereas suction only was used in 211 cases ( group 2 ( G2)). No significant difference between the two groups was found in regard to average operative time ( P = .23) , average time of resumption of oral diet ( P = .55) , average reprise of gastrointestinal transit ( P = .55) , and average length of hospital stay ( P = .41). As for postoperative complications , the incidence of IAAs was significantly higher in G2 ( 41/211; 19.4 %) compared with G1 ( 38/488; 7.7 %) ( P = .0000) , whereas no significant difference was found between the two groups in regard to wound infection ( G1: n = 2 or 0.4 %; G2: n = 4 or 1.8 %; P = .05) and small bowel obstruction rates ( G1: n = 8 or 1.6 %; G2: n = 2 or 0.9 %; P = .47). In contrast with the most recent literature on this topic , our results demonstrated that peritoneal irrigation and suction were associated with a lower rate of postoperative IAA formation compared with the suction-only approach in children with perforated appendicitis<disease> In such cases , peritoneal irrigation and abdominal drainage should be the preferred methods for peritoneal toilette , with no increase in operative time and postoperative morbidity.
