  The impact of vasomotor symptoms ( VMS) occurring in prostate cancer ( PC) patients whilst on androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT) has not been extensively researched. This longitudinal study sought to assess the VMS and identify any predictive factors. Data from 250 PC patients on ADT were prospectively evaluated between January 10 and August 13 using a physician-directed questionnaire , to assess the impact of VMS. Parameters including height , weight , body surface area ( BSA) , body mass index ( BMI) , duration/type of ADT , co-morbidities and ethnicity were recorded. Fifty ( 20 %) men reported no toxicity , whilst 171 ( 68.4 %) , and 29 ( 11.6 %) reported mild to moderate and severe<symptom> symptoms<symptom> , respectively. Drenching sweats<symptom> and hot flashes were common , and coexisted with sleep disturbances and fatigue<symptom>. Patients with severe toxicity were younger ( 73 vs. 77 yrs; p = 0.04) , had higher BMI ( 28 vs. 26; p = 0.02) , and higher BSA ( 1.99 vs. 1.90; p = 0.04) , when compared with those experiencing no toxicity. On multivariate analysis , younger age was predictive of sweats<symptom> and hot flushes , whilst Afro-Caribbean men were twice as likely to experience sweats<symptom> ( OR 2.03 , p = 0.05). The short-term side-effect profile of ADT for prostate cancer was favourable , though debilitating VMS can occur in a significant minority of cases. Younger age and higher BMI predicted for severe toxicity but not the duration of ADT.
