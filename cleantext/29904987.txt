  Cooperation can be maintained if cooperative behaviours are preferentially directed towards other cooperative individuals. Tag-based cooperation ( greenbeards)- where cooperation benefits individuals with the same tag as the actor- is one way to achieve this. Tag-based cooperation can be exploited by individuals who maintain the specific tag but do not cooperate , and selection to escape this exploitation can result in the evolution of tag diversity. We tested key predictions crucial for the evolution of cheat-mediated tag diversity using the production of iron-scavenging pyoverdine by the opportunistic pathogen , Pseduomonas aeruginosa<pathogen> as a model system. Using two strains that produce different pyoverdine types and their respective cheats , we show that cheats outcompete their homologous pyoverdine producer , but are outcompeted by the heterologous producer in well-mixed environments. As a consequence , co-inoculating two types of pyoverdine producer and one type of pyoverdine cheat resulted in the pyoverdine type whose cheat was not present having a large fitness advantage. Theory suggests that in such interactions , cheats can maintain tag diversity in spatially structured environments , but that tag-based cooperation will be lost in well-mixed populations , regardless of tag diversity. We saw that when all pyoverdine producers and cheats were co-inoculated in well-mixed environments , both types of pyoverdine producers were outcompeted , whereas spatial structure ( agar plates and compost microcosms) , rather than maintaining diversity , resulted in the domination of one pyoverdine producer. These results suggest cheats may play a more limited role in the evolution of pyoverdine diversity than predicted.
