  Stem cells or progenitor cells can undergo either asymmetric ( ACD) or symmetric ( SCD) cell division to produce appropriate number of themselves and differentiated daughter cells required for tissue regeneration. KRT5 positive keratinocyte is one of the progenitor cell types in epidermis. How ACD and SCD is balanced regulated in KRT5 positive cells are largely unclear. Herein , we demonstrated that in vitro cultured KRT5 positive keratinocytes could undergo either ACD or SCD. Silencing of KLF5 expression increased the ACD to SCD ratio , induced expression of KLF5 decreased the ACD to SCD ratio in KRT5 positive keratinocytes , and KLF5 inhibited ACD to SCD ratio through suppression of Notch1 expression. In conclusion , KLF5 played an important role in induction of SCD in KRT5 positive progenitor cells of the epidermis. These findings provided important insights in better understanding of progenitor cell behaviors during epidermal regeneration.
