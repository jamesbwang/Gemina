  Despite the wealth of physiological knowledge and plentiful genomes available , only few natural products of anaerobic bacteria have been identified until today and even less have been linked to their biosynthetic gene cluster. Here , we analyzed a unique NRPS-PKS hybrid gene cluster from an anaerobic Epsilonproteobacterium ( Sulfurospirillum barnesii). Phylogenetic analysis of key biosynthetic genes , gene expression studies , and comparative metabolomics resulted in the identification of the first anoxically biosynthesized NRPS-PKS hybrid metabolite: a lipo-dipeptide with a vinylogous side chain , called barnesin A. The absolute structure was verified by a modular total synthesis , and barnesin and derivatives were found to have antimicrobial activity , as well as selective and nanomolar inhibitory activity , against pharmacological important cysteine proteases , such as cathepsin B.
