  Surgical correction of deformity is a complex endeavor. Although more traditional , open techniques remain important , minimally invasive surgery ( MIS) techniques have been increasingly studied as an alternative approach. In particular , the circumferential MIS approach , which may incorporate a lateral/anterior as well as a subsequent posterior approach , has been investigated as a promising algorithm/protocol. Utilization of navigation guidance during MIS deformity correction is an important intraoperative tool for the surgeon.
