  The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT) is a key driver of cancer metastasis. In this issue of Developmental Cell , Aiello et al. ( 2018) demonstrate that an EMT mechanism involving protein internalization impacts cell migration , while Reichert et al. ( 2018) identify epithelial plasticity as a determinant of metastatic organotropism in pancreatic cancer.
