  Arachnoid cysts<symptom> are one of the most frequently encountered intracranial space-occupying lesions<symptom> in daily neurosurgery and neuroradiology practice. Majority of arachnoid cysts<symptom> , particularly those of smaller sizes , have a benign uneventful lifetime course. Certain symptoms may indicate serious complications related to underlying arachnoid cysts<symptom>. Hemorrhage<symptom> is one of the most fearsome complications of arachnoid cysts<symptom> and almost all reported cases in the literature have undergone surgical correction. In this study , we aimed to present clinical and radiologic follow-up findings in two adult cases of intracranial arachnoid cyst<symptom> with spontaneous intracystic hemorrhage<symptom> and associated subdural hematoma , one of which was successfully treated conservatively. In addition , we broadly summarized and discussed pertinent studies in the English literature.
