  Hair cells do not undergo spontaneous regeneration when they are damaged in the mammalian organ of Corti , leading to irreversible hearing loss. Previous studies have shown that 24-diamino-5-phenylthiazole ( DAPT) , an inhibitor of Notch signaling , plays a major role in inner ear development. However , whether DAPT influences antibiotic-induced hair cell damage remains uncertain. The present study aimed to investigate whether DAPT exerts protective or regenerative effects on neomycin-damaged hair cells. A histological analysis was carried out to assess the number and morphological changes of hair cells in cultured organ of Corti explants. Our results showed that in-vitro treatment with DAPT induced extra hair cells , whereas no newly generated supporting cells were found. We also found that DAPT was effective for preventing hair cell loss when cotreatment with neomycin was performed , suggesting that DAPT exerted protective effects on neomycin ototoxicity. In addition , DAPT treatment for 2-4 days following neomycin damage induced supernumerary hair cells. These findings indicate that inhibition of Notch signaling is a possible strategy for the treatment of hair cell loss caused by aminoglycoside antibiotics.
