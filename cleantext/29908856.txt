  The porcine corpus luteum ( CL) is NOT sensitive to the luteolytic effects of PGF-2α until days 12-13 of cycle. The control of `` luteolytic sensitivity '' ( LS) of the pig CL to PGF-2α is unknown , but it is temporally associated with macrophage infiltration into the CL. Since macrophages are the predominant source of TNF-α in the porcine CL , in other studies we examined the effects of TNF-α on porcine luteal cells in culture and showed that TNF-α induces LS in vitro. In Experiment 1 of this study possible mechanisms involved in the control of LS were examined , and involved measurement of the protein levels of PTGER2/EP -2 , and PTGER3/EP -3 in porcine CL collected before ( days 7-10) , versus after ( day 13) , the onset of the LS. In Experiment 2 , an examination of potential mechanisms involved in the control of LS by TNF-α , was carried out in which the effects of TNF-α on mRNA and protein expression of EP-2 , EP-3 and FP in cultured luteal cells , were examined. The results of Experiment 1 showed that PTGER-3/ EP-3 ( but not PTGER-2/ EP-2) levels decreased in porcine CLs after ( day 13) compared to before ( day 7-10) LS. In Experiment 2 , the data obtained showed that TNF-α decreased PTGER-3/ EP-3 and increased PTGFR/FP protein ( in EARLY stage CL). In conclusion , these studies suggest a role for PTGER-3/ EP-3 in the acquisition of LS , and support the hypothesis that TNF-α from CL macrophages plays a critical role in the control of LS in the porcine CL , by increasing PTGFR/FP , and decreasing PTGER-3/ EP-3 protein.
