  There are conflicting results concerning the prognostic value of the CpG island<disease> methylator phenotype ( CIMP) in non-metastatic colon cancer ( CC) patients. We studied this phenotype in stage III CC characterized for mismatch repair ( MMR) , RAS and BRAF status and treated with adjuvant FOLFOX-based regimen. Tumor samples of 1907 patients enrolled in the PETACC-8 adjuvant phase 3 trial were analyzed. The method used was methylation-specific PCR where CIMP + status was defined by methylation of at least three of the five following genes: IGF2 , CACNA1G , NEUROG1 , SOCS1 , and RUNX3. Association between CIMP status and overall survival ( OS) , disease-free survival ( DFS) , and survival after recurrence ( SAR) , was assessed by Cox model adjusted for prognostic factors and treatment arm ( FOLFOX4 Â± cetuximab). CIMP status was successfully determined in 1867 patients ( 97.9 %): 275 ( 14.7 %) tumors were CIMP +. Compared to CIMP- patients , CIMP + patients were more frequently older ( p = 0.002) , females ( p = 0.04) , with right-sided ( p < 0.0001) , grade 3-4 ( p < 0.0001) , pN2 ( p = 0.001) , dMMR ( p < 0.0001) , BRAF mutated ( p < 0.0001) , and RAS wild-type ( p < 0.0001) tumors. In multivariate analysis , CIMP + status was associated with shorter OS ( HR: 1.46; 95 % CI 1.02- 1.94; p = 0.04) and SAR ( HR: 1.76; 95 % CI 1.20- 2.56; p < 0.0004); but not DFS ( HR: 1.15 95 % CI 0.86- 1.54; p = 0.34). A non-significant trend of detrimental effect of cetuximab was observed in patients with CIMP + tumors for OS , DFS , and SAR. In a large cohort of well-defined stage III CC patients , CIMP + phenotype is associated with a shorter OS and SAR but not to DFS.
