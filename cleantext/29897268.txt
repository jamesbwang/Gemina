  There is a lack of published , validated questionnaires for evaluating psychosocial morbidity in patients with breast hypertrophy undergoing breast reduction surgery. To validate the breast evaluation questionnaire ( BEQ) , originally developed for the assessment of breast augmentation patients , for the assessment of psychosocial morbidity in patients with breast hypertrophy undergoing breast reduction surgery. Validation study Subjects: Women with macromastia Methods: The validation of the BEQ , adapted to breast reduction , was performed in several steps. Content validity , reliability , construct validity and responsiveness were assessed. The original version was adjusted according to the results for content validity and resulted in item reduction and a modified BEQ ( mBEQ) that was then assessed for reliability , construct validity and responsiveness. Internal and external validation was performed for the modified BEQ. Convergent validity was tested against Breast-Q ( reduction) and discriminate validity was tested against the SF-36. Known-groups validation revealed significant differences between the normal population and patients undergoing breast reduction surgery. The BEQ showed good reliability by test-re-test analysis and high responsiveness. The modified BEQ may be reliable , valid and responsive instrument for assessing women who undergo breast reduction.
