  Cells sense and respond to mechanical cues from the extracellular matrix ( ECM) via integrins. ECM stiffness is known to enhance integrin clustering and response to epidermal growth factor ( EGF) , but we lack information on when or if these mechanosensitive growth factor receptors and integrins converge intracellularly. Towards closing this knowledge gap , we combined a biomaterial platform with transcriptomics , molecular biology , and functional assays to link integrin-mediated mechanosensing and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) signaling. We found that high integrin Î±
