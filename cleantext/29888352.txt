  Two metal-organic frameworks ( MOFs) , ( Zn ( BIPA) ( tfbdc)) n ( 1) and ( ( Cd ( BIPA) ( tfbdc) ( H2O)) Â· DMF) n ( 2) , were hydrothermally synthesized using the self-assembly of the `` V-shape '' BIPA ligand ( bis ( 4- ( 1H-imidazol-1-yl) phenyl) amine) and the H2tfbdc ligand ( 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid) with Zn/Cd metal salts. 1 is a 2D hcb framework and 2 is a 2D sql network. Their applications in detecting metal and inorganic ions were also explored. The results indicate that 1 exhibits dual-responsive photoluminescence sensing for Fe3 + and Cr2O72- ions while 2 can detect Hg2 + and Cr2O72- ions.
