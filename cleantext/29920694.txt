  Trichuris muris is a natural mouse helminth pathogen which establishes infection specifically in the caecum and proximal colon. The rapid expulsion of T. muris in resistant mouse strains is associated with the induction of a protective T helper cell type 2 ( Th2)- polarized immune response. Susceptible mouse strains , in contrast , mount an inappropriate Th1 response to T. muris infection. Expression of the chemokine CXCL13 by stromal follicular dendritic cells attracts CXCR5-expressing cells towards the B-cell follicles. Previous studies using a complex in vivo depletion model have suggested that CXCR5-expressing conventional dendritic cells ( cDC) help regulate the induction of Th2-polarized responses. Here , transgenic mice with CXCR5 deficiency specifically restricted to CD11c
