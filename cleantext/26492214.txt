  Many clinical studies including mental health interventions do not use a health state utility instrument , which is essential for producing quality-adjusted life years. In the absence of such utility instrument , mapping algorithms can be applied to estimate utilities from a disease-specific instrument.AimsWe aim to develop mapping algorithms from two widely used depression<symptom> scales; the Depression<symptom> Anxiety<symptom> Stress Scales ( DASS-21) and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale ( K-10) , onto the most widely used health state utility instrument , the EQ-5D-5L , using eight country-specific value sets. A total of 917 respondents with self-reported depression<symptom> were recruited to describe their health on the DASS-21 and the K-10 as well as the new five-level version of the EQ-5D , referred to as the EQ-5D-5L. Six regression models were used: ordinary least squares regression , generalised linear models , beta binomial regression , fractional logistic regression model , MM-estimation and censored least absolute deviation. Root mean square error , mean absolute error and r2 were used as model performance criteria to select the optimal mapping function for each country-specific value set. Fractional logistic regression model was generally preferred in predicting EQ-5D-5L utilities from both DASS-21 and K-10. The only exception was the Japanese value set , where the beta binomial regression performed best. Mapping algorithms can adequately predict EQ-5D-5L utilities from scores on DASS-21 and K-10. This enables disease-specific data from clinical trials to be applied for estimating outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years for use in economic evaluations.Declaration of interestNone.
