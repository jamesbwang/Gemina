  Clinical depression<symptom> in children as young as age 3 has been validated , and prevalence rates are similar to the school-age disorder. Homotypic continuity between early and later childhood depression<symptom> has been observed , with alterations in brain function and structure similar to those reported in depressed adults. These findings highlight the importance of identifying and treating depression<symptom> as early as developmentally possible , given the relative treatment resistance and small effect sizes for treatments later in life. The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial of a dyadic parent-child psychotherapy for early childhood depression<symptom> that focuses on enhancing the child 's emotional competence and emotion regulation. A modified version of the empirically tested parent-child interaction therapy with a novel `` emotion development '' module ( PCIT-ED) was compared with a waiting list condition in a randomized controlled trial in 229 parent-child dyads with children 3-6.11 years of age. Both study arms lasted 18 weeks. Children in the PCIT-ED group had lower rates of depression<symptom> ( primary outcome) , lower depression<symptom> severity , and lower impairment compared with those in the waiting list condition ( Cohen 's d values , > 1.0). Measures of child emotional functioning and parenting stress and depression<symptom> were significantly improved in the PCIT-ED group. The findings from this randomized controlled trial of a parent-child psychotherapy for early childhood depression<symptom> suggest that earlier identification and intervention in this chronic and relapsing disorder represents a key new pathway for more effective treatment. Manualized PCIT-ED , administered by master 's- level clinicians , is feasible for delivery in community health settings.
