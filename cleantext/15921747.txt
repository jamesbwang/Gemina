  This study aimed to assess changes in pupil size , uncorrected visual acuity , refraction , and the direct and consensual light reflexes after instillation of brimonidine 0.1 % in healthy subjects. The investigation comprised 46 eyes of 23 healthy subjects with no eye diseases in whom brimonidine 0.1 % was instilled in the right eye. Pupil size was measured quantitatively under photopic and scotopic conditions , uncorrected visual acuity , refraction , and direct and consensual light reflexes before and at 1 , 6 , and 24 h after instillation. We found No significant change was found in refraction or uncorrected visual acuity ( P = 0.999 and P = 0.998 , respectively). A significant reduction in pupil size was observed under scotopic conditions at 1 h and 6 h after instillation ( P = 0.007 and P = 0.005 , respectively). The rate of pupil contraction and constriction speed measured by light reflexes were significantly increased at 1 h and 6 h after instillation ( P = 0.021 and P = 0.033 , respectively). Brimonidine 0.1 % induced a significant reduction in pupil size under scotopic conditions without a significant change in refraction or visual acuity due to suppression of the sympathetic nervous system.
