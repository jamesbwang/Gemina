  We report three primary thyroid angiosarcoma ( PTA) cases revealing distinctive morphological features. A systematic literature review completed our analysis to evaluate the most important morphological factors for predicting prognosis in PTAs. Three rare PTA cases were analysed. In addition , we identified 46 previously reported PTAs with available follow-up data to compare morphological features related to prognosis between patients with a favourable <i> <i> <i> <i> versus </i> </i> </i> </i> aggressive outcome. The three PTAs displayed considerable architectural heterogeneity: case 1 presented a well circumscribed tumour , extensively necrotic , with only a few highly pleomorphic vascular proliferation; cases 2 and 3 both exhibited plump epithelioid cells forming rudimentary vascular spaces or solid sheets. Case 3 also presented angioinvasion. Cases 1 and 2 were alive and disease-free at 40 and 73 months following diagnosis , respectively , whereas case 3 died within 14 months. Other significant prognostic factors were highlighted by our review and literature data analysis: increased tumour size ( p = 0.042) , extrathyroidal extension ( p = 0.009) , and distant metastases at diagnosis ( p = 0.001). Although regarded as highly aggressive , PTA can also be characterised by an unusual favourable outcome. For the first time we highlight the importance of reporting angioinvasion , in cases of PTA , as a possible adverse prognostic factor.
