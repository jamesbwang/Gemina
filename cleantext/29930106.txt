  The members of the light-harvesting-complex protein ( LHCP) family , which include the one-helix proteins ( OHPs) , are characterized by one to four membrane-spanning helices. These pro-teins function in light absorption and energy dissipation , sensing light intensity , and triggering photomorphogenesis or binding of chlorophyll and intermediates of chlorophyll biosynthesis. Arabidopsis thaliana contains two OHPs , while four homologs ( named high-light-induced pro-teins , Hlips) exist in Synechocystis PCC6803. Various functions have been assigned to Hlips , ranging from photoprotection and assembly of photosystem ( PS) I and PSII to regulation of the early steps of chlorophyll biosynthesis , but little is known about the function of the two plant OHPs. Here , we show that the two Arabidopsis OHPs form heterodimers and that the stromal part of OHP2 interacts with the plastid-localized PSII assembly factor HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE 244 ( HCF244). Moreover , concurrent accumulation of the two OHPs and HCF244 is critical for the stability of all three proteins. In particular , the absence of OHP2 leads to the complete loss of OHP1 and HCF244. We used a virus-induced gene silencing approach to minimize the expression of OHP1 or OHP2 in adult Arabidopsis plants and revealed that OHP2 is essential for the accumulation of the PSII core subunits , while the other photosynthetic com-plexes and the major LHCPs remained unaffected. We examined the potential functions of the OHP1-OHP2-HCF244 complex in the assembly and/or repair of PSII and propose a role for this heterotrimeric complex in thylakoid membrane biogenesis.
