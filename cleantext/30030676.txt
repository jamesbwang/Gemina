  McArdle disease is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficiency of the PYGM gene-encoded muscle isoform of glycogen phosphorylase. Some cases of `` manifesting '' heterozygotes or carriers ( i.e. , patients who show some McArdle-like symptoms or signs despite being carriers of only one mutated PYGM allele) have been reported in the literature but there is controversy , with misdiagnosis being a possibility. The purpose of our study was to determine if there are actually `` manifesting '' heterozygotes of McArdle disease and , if existing , whether statin treatment can trigger such condition. Eighty-one relatives of McArdle patients ( among a total of 16 different families) were studied. We determined whether they were carriers of PYGM mutations and also collected information on exercise tests ( second wind and modified Wingate anaerobic test) and statin intake. We found 50 carriers and 31 non-carriers of PYGM mutations. Although we found existence of heterozygotes manifesting some exercise-related muscle problems such as exacerbated myalgia<symptom> or weakness<symptom> , they only accounted for 14 % of the carriers and muscle<symptom> symptoms<symptom> were milder than those commonly reported in patients. Further , no carrier ( whether reporting symptoms or not) showed the second wind phenomenon or a flat blood lactate response to maximal-intensity exercise , both of which are hallmarks of McArdle disease. On the other hand , statin myotoxicity was not associated with muscle<symptom> symptom<symptom> onset.
