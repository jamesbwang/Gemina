  Spectrin , a major component of the membrane skeletal meshwork of metazoan cells , is implicated to associate with membrane domains and is known to act as a scaffold for stabilization and activation of different signalling modules. We have studied the effect of GM1 ( monosialotetrahexosyl ganglioside) , a well-known model ganglioside and a signalling moiety , on the interaction of non-erythroid brain spectrin with both saturated and unsaturated aminophospholipids by spectroscopic methods. We observe that GM1 modulates brain spectrin-aminophospholipid interaction to the greatest degree whereas its effect on erythroid spectrin is not as pronounced. Fluorescence quenching studies show that brain spectrin interacts with DMPC/DMPE-based vesicles with a 10-fold increased affinity in presence of very low amounts of 2 % and 5 % GM1 , and the extent of quenching decreases progressively in presence of increasing amounts of GM1. Interaction of brain spectrin with unsaturated membrane systems of DOPC/DOPE weakens in presence GM1. Increase in the mean lifetime of the Trp residues of brain spectrin in presence of GM1 indicates change in the microenvironment of spectrin , without affecting the secondary structure of the protein significantly. Studies on pressure- area isotherm of Langmuir-Blodgett monolayer and Brewster 's angle microscopy show that GM1 has an expanding effect on the aminophospholipid monolayers , and ordered regions in DMPC/DMPE mixed monolayers are formed and are stabilized at higher pressure. GM1-induced fluidization of the phospholipid membranes<symptom> and probable physical contact between bulky sugar head group of GM1 and spectrin , may explain the modulatory role of GM1 on aminophospholipid interactions with nonerythroid brain spectrin.
