  Clinical order patterns derived from data-mining electronic health records can be a valuable source of decision support content. However , the quality of crowdsourcing such patterns may be suspect depending on the population learned from. For example , it is unclear whether learning inpatient practice patterns from a university teaching service , characterized by physician-trainee teams with an emphasis on medical education , will be of variable quality versus an attending-only medical service that focuses strictly on clinical care. Machine learning clinical order patterns by association rule episode mining from teaching versus attending-only inpatient medical services illustrated some practice variability , but converged towards similar top results in either case. We further validated the automatically generated content by confirming alignment with external reference standards extracted from clinical practice guidelines.
