  Dynamic combinatorial chemistry ( DCC) is a powerful supramolecular approach for discovering ligands for biomolecules. To date , most , if not all , biologically-templated DCC employ only a single biomolecule in directing the self-assembly process. To expand the scope and potential of DCC , herein , we developed a novel multi-protein DCC strategy which combines the discriminatory power of zwitterionic ` thermal-tag ' with the sensitivity of differential scanning fluorimetry. This strategy enables the discovery of ligands against several proteins of interest concurrently. It is remarkably sensitive and could differentiate the binding of ligands to structurally-similar subfamily members , which is extremely challenging to achieve. Through this approach , we were able to simultaneously identify subfamily-selective probes against two clinically important epigenetic enzymes , FTO ( 7; IC ₅₀ = 2.6 µM) and ALKBH3 ( 8; IC ₅₀ = 3.7 µM). To our knowledge , this is the first report of a subfamily-selective ALKBH3 inhibitor. The developed strategy could , in principle , be adapted to a broad range of proteins , thus it shall be of widespread scientific interest.
