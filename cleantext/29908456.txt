  European regulation 2016/427 ( the first package of the so-called Real-Driving Emissions ( RDE) regulation) introduced on-road testing with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems ( PEMS) to complement the chassis dynamometer laboratory ( Type I) test for the type approval of light-duty vehicles in the European Union since September 2017. The Not-To-Exceed ( NTE) limit for a pollutant is the Type I test limit multiplied by a conformity factor that includes a margin for the additional measurement uncertainty of PEMS relative to standard laboratory equipment. The variability of measured results related to RDE trip design , vehicle operating conditions , and data evaluation remain outside of the uncertainty margin. The margins have to be reviewed annually ( recital 10 of regulation 2016/646). This paper lays out the framework used for the first review of the NO
