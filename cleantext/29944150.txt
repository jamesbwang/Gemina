  The peroxidase activity of cytochrome c is proposed to contribute to apoptosis by peroxidation of cardiolipin in the mitochondrial inner membrane. However , cytochrome c heme is hexa-coordinate with a methionine ( Met80) on the distal side , stopping it from acting as an efficient peroxidase. The first naturally occurring variant of cytochrome c discovered , G41S , has higher peroxidase activity than wild-type. To understand the basis for this increase and gain insight into the peroxidase activity of wild-type , we have studied wild-type , G41S and the unnatural variant G41T. Through a combined kinetic and mass spectrometric analysis , we have shown that hydrogen peroxide specifically oxidizes Met80 to the sulfoxide. In the absence of substrate this can be further oxidized to the sulfone , leading to a decrease in peroxidase activity. Peroxidase activity can be correlated with the proportion of sulfoxide present and if fully in that form , all variants have the same activity without a lag phase caused by activation of the protein.
