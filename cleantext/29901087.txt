  Toll‑like receptors ( TLRs) are expressed in human bone marrow‑derived mesenchymal stromal cells ( BM‑MSCs). The activation of TLRs is important in the proliferation , differ-entiation , migration and hematopoiesis‑supporting functions of BM‑MSCs. MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are involved in various biological functions by mediating mRNA degradation or inhibiting the translation of target genes. Our previous study confirmed that TLRs regulate the migration ability of BM‑MSCs. It was also identified that multiple miRNAs were regulated by TLRs. In view of this , it was hypothesized that TLR‑regulated miRNAs may be important in regulating the migration of BM‑MSCs. The migration ability of BM‑MSCs was evaluated following transfection of the cells with the mimics or antagonists of miRNA ( miR) 27b , miR‑146a , miR‑155 and miR‑154. miR‑155 significantly inhibited cell migration. Myosin light chain kinase ( MYLK) was identified as the direct target of miR‑155 in BM‑MSCs , which was further investigated using the luciferase reporter assay. However , miR‑155 did not affect the expression of upstream proteins of the RhoA pathway controlling the activity of MYLK , suggesting that miR‑155 directly suppressed the expression of MYLK without affecting the RhoA pathway. These results may facilitate the development and clinical use of BM‑MSCs in terms of their migration.
