  A major component of phase II drug metabolism is the covalent addition of glucuronic acid to metabolites and xenobiotics. This activity is carried out by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases ( UGT) which bind the UDP-glucuronic acid donor and catalyze the covalent addition of glucuronic acid sugar moieties onto a wide variety of substrates. UGTs play important roles in drug detoxification and were recently shown to act in an inducible form of multi-drug resistance in cancer patients. Despite their biological importance , structural understanding of these enzymes is limited. The C-terminal domain is identical for all UGT1A family members and required for binding to UDP-glucuronic acid as well as involved in contacts with substrates. Here , we report the backbone assignments for the C-terminal domain of UGT1A. These assignments are a critical tool for the development of a deeper biochemical understanding of substrate specificity and enzymatic activity.
