  Personal hygiene routines , such as nail cutting , are essential for maintaining good health. However , individuals with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) and other developmental disabilities often struggle to comply with essential , personal hygiene routines. We conducted a systematic replication of Schumacher and Rapp ( 2011) , Shabani and Fisher ( 2006) , and Bishop et al. ( 2013) to evaluate an intervention that did not require escape extinction for increasing compliance with nail cutting. With two adolescents diagnosed with ASD who resisted nail cutting , we evaluated the effects of delivering a preferred edible item contingent on compliance with nail cutting. Results indicated that the treatment reduced participants ' escape responses and increased their compliance with nail cutting.
