  Perioperative dose-dense chemotherapy ( DDCT) with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF) prophylaxis is a standard treatment for patients with high-risk breast cancer. The approval of this approach in Japan led to the widespread adoption of DDCT , despite limited efficacy and safety data among Japanese patients. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant DDCT for Japanese patients with breast cancer. This prospective , multicenter , phase II study evaluated 52 women with operable human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer and axillary lymph node metastasis. Neoadjuvant DDCT ( adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide or epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel) was administrated every 2 weeks with G-CSF support. The study endpoints were the rates of pathological complete response ( pCR) , febrile neutropenia , treatment completion , toxicities , and the relative dose intensity ( RDI). The pCR rate was 21.9 % ( 9/41) and the triple-negative ( TN) subtype<pathogen> was significantly associated with a high pCR rate ( triple-negative: 53.3 % vs. luminal A: 7.7 % and luminal B: 0 %; p = 0.003). The treatment completion rate was 80.8 % ( 42/52) and the average RDI was 98.9 %. Most adverse events were manageable and tolerable. Six patients ( 11.5 %) developed febrile neutropenia. Grade 3-4 adverse events were slightly more common among older patients ( 57 %) with a low protocol completion rate ( â‰¥ 65 years: 42.9 % vs. < 65 years: 86.7 % , p = 0.0062). The pCR rate for DDCT was similar to that of standard chemotherapy , although it was remarkably effective for the TN subtype. DDCT may be feasible for Japanese patients with breast cancer although caution is needed for older patients.
