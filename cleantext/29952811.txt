  With an increasing number of left ventricular assist devices ( LVADs) being implanted , the need for adequate cardiac rehabilitation ( CR) regimens meeting the special needs of these patients arises. Only a few studies have reported experience gained on this topic. Structured CR strategies are poorly implemented. The aim was to evaluate the characteristics , therapeutic needs , and scope of LVAD patients at admission to CR within a greater cohort in order to identify their special CR needs. Retrospective single-center study; 69 LVAD patients ( 50.7 ± 13.6 y; 59 male; 48 HVAD; 21 HeartMate II) who completed first inpatient CR were included. Patient records were used to document relevant medical information ( including the results of a 6-min walk test and a maximal isometric strength test for quadriceps femoral muscles in both legs) and the International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health for classification of health and health-related domains. Patient characteristics demonstrated a heterogeneous group: CR was started 44 ± 38.6 d after implantation; CR duration was 28 ± 9.7 d. Despite similar etiology , physical and psychological condition was diverse , although , overall a high degree of impairment was present , especially in the body function ( 79.7 %) and activity and participation ( 95.7 %) domains. The results demonstrated the need for a highly individualized approach in the somatic and also in the education , psychosocial , and social therapeutic regimes. The results demonstrate a heterogeneous group with a high level of impairment and special needs in many CR domains. The development and evaluation of a special highly individualized approach of CR , which meets the special needs of these patients , is needed.
