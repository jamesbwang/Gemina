  Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi<pathogen> ( AMF) , ubiquitous symbiotic fungi<pathogen> associated with the majority of terrestrial plants , were demonstrated to play important roles in arsenic ( As) translocation and transformation in the plant-soil continuum , and substantially influence plant As tolerance. However , the direct involvement of AMF in As methylation and volatilization and their molecular mechanisms remain unsolved. Here , an arsenite methyltransferase gene RiMT-11 was identified and characterized from AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis<pathogen>. Heterologous expression of RiMT-11 enhanced arsenite resistance of E coli ( Î”ars) through methylating As into monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA) , dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA) and ultimately volatile trimethyl arsine ( TMAs). In a two-compartment in vitro monoxenic cultivation system , methylated and volatile As were also detected from AM symbioses with arsenate addition , accompanied by strong up-regulation of RiMT-11 expression in extraradical hyphae. The present study provided direct evidence and illustrated an underlying mechanism of As methylation and volatilization by AMF , leading to a deeper insight into the role of AMF in As biogeochemical cycling.
