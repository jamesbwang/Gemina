  The discovery that atypical chemokine receptors ( ACKRs) can initiate alternative signaling pathways rather than classical G-protein coupled receptor ( GPCR) signaling has changed the paradigm of chemokine receptors and their roles in modulating chemotactic responses. The ACKR family has grown over the years , with discovery of new functions and roles in a variety of pathophysiological conditions. However , the extent to which these receptors regulate normal physiology is still continuously expanding. In particular , atypical chemokine receptor 3 ( ACKR3) has proven to be an important receptor in mediating normal biological functions , including cardiac development and migration of cortical neurons. In this review , we illustrate the versatile and intriguing role of ACKR3 in physiology.
