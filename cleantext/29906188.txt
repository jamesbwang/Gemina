  The temperature dependence of the excitation spectrum in NaOsO _ ( 3) through its metal-to-insulator transition ( MIT) at 410 K has been investigated using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering at the Os L _ ( 3) edge. High-resolution ( ΔE ∼ 56 meV) measurements show that the well-defined , low-energy magnons in the insulating state weaken and dampen upon approaching the metallic state. Concomitantly , a broad continuum of excitations develops which is well described by the magnetic fluctuations of a nearly antiferromagnetic Fermi liquid. By revealing the continuous evolution of the magnetic quasiparticle spectrum as it changes its character from itinerant to localized , our results provide unprecedented insight into the nature of the MIT in NaOsO _ ( 3) ( J.
