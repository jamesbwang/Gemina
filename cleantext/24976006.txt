  The resolution adopted in 2006 by the World Health Organization on international trade and health urges Member States to understand the implications of international trade and trade agreements for health and to address any challenges arising through policies and regulations. The government of Maldives is an importer of health services ( with outgoing medical travelers) , through offering a comprehensive universal health care package for its people that includes subsidized treatment abroad for services unavailable in the country. By the end of the first year of the scheme approximately US$ 11.6 m had been spent by the government of Maldives to treat patients abroad. In this study , affordability , continuity and quality of this care were assessed from the perspective of the medical traveler to provide recommendations for safer and more cost effective medical travel policy. Despite universal health care , a substantial proportion of Maldivian travelers have not accessed the government subsidy , and a third reported not having sufficient funds for the treatment episode abroad. Among the five most visited hospitals in this study , none were JCI accredited at the time of the study period and only three from India had undergone the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals ( NABH) in India. Satisfaction with treatment received was high amongst travelers but concern for the continuity of care was very high , and more than a third of the patients had experienced complications arising from the treatment overseas. Source countries can use their bargaining power in the trade of health services to offer a more comprehensive package for medical travelers. Source countries with largely public funded health systems need to ensure that medical travel is truly affordable and universal , with measures for quality control such as the use of accredited foreign hospitals to make it safer and to impose measures that ensure the continuity of care for travelers.
