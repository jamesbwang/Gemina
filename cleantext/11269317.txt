  Trypsin-like serine proteases are essential in physiological processes. Studies have shown that N-glycans are important for serine protease expression and secretion , but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here , we report a common mechanism of N-glycosylation in the protease domains of corin , enteropeptidase and prothrombin in calnexin-mediated glycoprotein folding and extracellular expression. This mechanism , which is independent of calreticulin and operates in a domain-autonomous manner , involves two steps: direct calnexin binding to target proteins and subsequent calnexin binding to monoglucosylated N-glycans. Elimination of N-glycosylation sites in the protease domains of corin , enteropeptidase and prothrombin inhibits corin and enteropeptidase cell surface expression and prothrombin secretion in transfected HEK293 cells. Similarly , knocking down calnexin expression in cultured cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes reduced corin cell surface expression and prothrombin secretion , respectively. Our results suggest that this may be a general mechanism in the trypsin-like serine proteases with N-glycosylation sites in their protease domains.
