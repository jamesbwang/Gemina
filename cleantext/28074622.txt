  In addition to its wide geographical distribution , osteoglossiform fishes represent one of the most ancient freshwater teleost lineages; making it an important group for systematic and evolutionary studies. These fishes had a Gondwanan origin and their past distribution may have contributed to the diversity present in this group. However , cytogenetic and genomic data are still scarce , making it difficult to track evolutionary trajectories within this order. In addition , their wide distribution , with groups endemic to different continents , hinders an integrative study that allows a globalized view of its evolutionary process. Here , we performed a detailed chromosomal analysis in Notopteridae fishes , using conventional and advanced molecular cytogenetic methods. Moreover , the genetic distances of examined species were assessed by genotyping using diversity arrays technology sequencing ( DArTseq). These data provided a clear picture of the genetic diversity between African and Asian Notopteridae species , and were highly consistent with the chromosomal , geographical , and historical data , enlightening their evolutionary diversification. Here , we discuss the impact of continental drift and split of Pangea on their recent diversity , as well as the contribution to biogeographical models that explain their distribution , highlighting the role of the Indian subcontinent in the evolutionary process within the family.
