  There is ample evidence that single fraction radiation therapy ( SFRT) is equally efficacious as more costly and morbid multi-fraction regimens. We previously demonstrated that an audit-based intervention increased the use of SFRT in all regional cancer centers the year following. However , other investigators have demonstrated interventions were only associated with a transient one-year change in prescribing practices. We sought to determine if our intervention resulted in a more lasting impact. In 2012 we performed an audit of prescribing practices of individual physicians , which were then presented to leaders and oncologists as an intervention to increase SFRT. We then compared the use of SFRT from 2007-2011 ( pre-intervention) and 2013-2016 ( post-intervention) in all 31,192 patients treated in our provincial program. The use of SFRT increased from 49.2 % to 58.9 % post intervention ( p < 0.001) , with rates in 2007-2011 of 51 , 51 , 48 , 49 , and 48 % , while post intervention in 2013-2016 they were 60 , 62 , 59 , and 56 %. Post intervention , half of the centers prescribed SFRT in a relatively narrow range ( 55-58 %). However , across all centers , there was still a broad range , with the lowest and highest users at 35 % and 81 % respectively , though the lowest utilizing center still showed a significant increase ( 26 % to 35 %; p < 0.001). Our audit and educational based intervention resulted in a lasting and meaningful 10 % change in practice. Our provincial rate is similar to a previously recommended benchmark rate of 60 % , though we continue to see significant variation by center , suggesting further room for improvement in provincial standardization. With emerging evidence in support of ablative radiotherapy for select populations of patients with bone metastases , future benchmark rates of SFRT should be readdressed , though our data suggest programmatic comparison and dissemination of SFRT prescribing practices can achieve a population-based SFRT utilization rate near 60 %.
