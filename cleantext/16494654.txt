  This article provides an overview of headache<symptom> in the setting of pituitary adenoma. The purpose of this article is to educate providers on the association , possible pathophysiology , and the clinical presentation of headache<symptom> in pituitary tumor. Recent prospective evaluations indicate that risk factors for development of headache<symptom> in the setting of pituitary adenoma include highly proliferative tumors , cavernous sinus invasion , and personal or family history of headache<symptom> Migraine-like headaches<symptom> are the predominant presentation. Unilateral headaches<symptom> are often ipsilateral to the side of cavernous sinus invasion. In summary , this paper describes how the size and type of pituitary tumors play an important role in causation of headaches<symptom>. Pituitary adenoma-associated headache<symptom> can also mimic primary headache<symptom> disorders making recognition of a secondary process difficult. Therefore , this paper highlights the association of between trigeminal autonomic cephalgias and pituitary adenomas and urges practitioners to maintain a high index of suspicion when evaluating patients with these uncommon headache<symptom> presentations. However , on balance<symptom> , given the prevalence of both primary headache<symptom> disorders and pituitary adenomas , determining causality can be challenging. A thoughtful and multidisciplinary approach is often the best management strategy , and treatment may require the expertise of multiple specialties including neurology , neurosurgery , and endocrinology.
