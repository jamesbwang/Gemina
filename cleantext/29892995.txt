  Computational modelling plays an important role in right ventricular ( RV) haemodynamic analysis. However , current approaches employ smoothed ventricular anatomies. The aim of this study is to characterise RV haemodynamics including detailed endocardial structures like trabeculae , moderator band and papillary muscles ( PMs). Four paired detailed and smoothed RV endocardium models ( two male and two female) were reconstructed from ex-vivo human hearts high-resolution magnetic resonance images ( MRI). Detailed models include structures with â‰¥ 1 mm
