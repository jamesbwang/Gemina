  To assess the safety and efficacy of phaco-canaloplasty in patients with concomitant advanced pseudoexfoliation glaucoma and cataract. The study included 56 patients ( 57 eyes) who underwent phacoanaloplasty guided by Glaucolight microcatheter. All patients were followed up for 48 months. Visual acuity , changes of intraocular pressure ( IOP) , use of glaucoma medications , incidence of complications , as well as postsurgical interventions were examined. Mean preoperative IOP decreased significantly from 29.8 mmHg ( 15.8-61.6) with a mean of 1.92 ( 0-3) glaucoma drops to 12.9 mmHg ( 11.0-19.6) with a mean of 0.12 ( 0-3) drops respectively 48 months after phacocanaloplasty. Mean visual acuity increased from preoperative 0.15 ( 0.01-0.8) to 0.6 ( 0.01-1.2). The most frequent complications included intraoperative perforation of Descemet 's membrane ( 4 eyes , 7 %) and hyphema ( 37 eyes , 65 %) , IOP spikes ( 4 eyes , 7 %) and inflammation<symptom> ( 4 eyes , 7 %) in the early postoperative period. Phacocanaloplasty in eyes with concomitant advanced pseudoexfoliation glaucoma and cataract re-establishes the natural outflow system and leads to significant IOP reduction with minimal risk of intra- and postoperative complications.
