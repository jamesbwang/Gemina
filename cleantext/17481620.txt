  We conducted this study to analyze the sperm DNA fragmentation index , conventional semen parameters , blood microelements and seminal plasma reactive oxygen species ( ROS) in patients with male infertility<symptom> to determine the association between each of the above male physiological parameters and DNA fragmentation index and infertility<symptom>. Eighty cases of infertile males and 20 cases of normal males with children were divided into the infertility<symptom> and control groups , respectively. Sperm DNA fragmentation index , conventional semen parameters , serum microelement content and seminal plasma ROS levels were detected , and the existing correlation between sperm DNA fragmentation index and the various physiological parameters were studied. The sperm DNA fragmentation index had no correlation with conventional sperm parameters. Our results demonstrated that zinc , lead and magnesium ions in the serum microelements were correlated with sperm DNA fragmentation ( p < 0.05). Upon an increase in zinc and lead serum concentration , there was a subsequent increase in sperm DNA fragmentation ( p = 0.008). Furthermore , when magnesium ion increased , it also caused an increase in sperm DNA fragmentation ( p < 0.05). The seminal plasma ROS of infertile males was higher than that of males with children ( p < 0.05). Our results suggest that sperm DNA fragmentation index is closely associated with the infertility<symptom> rate and microelements of serum and seminal plasma ROS can impact the formation of sperm DNA fragmentation. Therefore , the sperm DNA fragmentation index can serve as an important parameter to assess male
