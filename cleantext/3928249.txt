  Diabetes constitutes a significant health problem that leads to many long term health issues including renal , cardiovascular , and neuropathic complications. Many of these problems can result in increased health care costs , as well risk of ICU stay and mortality. To date , no published study has used predictive modeling to examine the relative influence of diabetes , diabetic health maintenance , and comorbidities on outcomes in ICU patients. Using the MIMIC-III database , machine learning and binomial logistic regression modeling were applied to predict risk of mortality. The final models achieved good fit with AUC values of 0.787 and 0.785 respectively. Additionally , this study demonstrated that robust classification can be done as a combination of five variables ( HbA1c , mean glucose during stay , diagnoses upon admission , age , and type of admission) to predict risk as compared with other machine learning models that require nearly 35 variables for similar risk assessment and prediction.
