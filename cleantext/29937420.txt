  Orthostatic hypotension<symptom> ( OH) is often reported as a significant potential adverse effect of antidepressant use but the association between phasic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( BP) and antidepressants has not yet been investigated. This cross-sectional study compares continuously measured phasic BP and prevalence of OH in a cohort of antidepressant users ≥ 50 years compared with an age- and sex-matched cohort not taking antidepressants. OH was defined as a drop in systolic BP ≥ 20 mm Hg or in diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg at 30 seconds after standing , measured using continuous beat-to-beat finometry. Multilevel time × group interactions revealed significantly greater systolic and diastolic BP drop in antidepressant users than nonusers at 30 seconds after stand<symptom>. The prevalence of OH among antidepressant users was 31 % ( 63/206) , compared with 17 % in nonusers ( X
