  Ureteric stents are frequently inserted post endourological procedures. However , subsequent endoscopic stent removal requires a second procedure for the patient and the availability of necessary resources. Longer duration of indwelling stents can lead to increased risk of symptoms and complications. The use of magnetic stents removed with a magnetic retrieval device ( BlackStar Â©) , offers an alternative which obviates the need for cystoscopy. We assessed the outcomes for this novel method of stent removal in our institution. A retrospective analysis was performed of all patients undergoing magnetic stent insertion and subsequent removal in a nurse-led clinic over a nine-month period. Patients were followed up with a prospective validated Ureteral Stent Symptoms Questionnaire ( USSQ) 3. A cost analysis was also performed. In total , 59 patients were treated using magnetic stents. The complication rate was low ( 6.7 %). The median duration of indwelling stent was 5.8 days ( range 1-11 days). Patients reported haematuria and lower urinary tract symptoms but > 90 % experienced no functional impairment with minimal days of employment lost ( mean 0.75 days). All patients reported satisfaction with nurse-led stent removal and 97 % were happy to have stents removed via this method in the future. The total financial savings were estimated at $ 47,790 over this period. Nurse-led removal of magnetic stents is safe and well tolerated by patients and enables expedient stent removal. It also provides a significant cost benefit and frees up valuable endoscopic resources.
