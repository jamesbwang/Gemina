  Objective To perform a single-centre , detailed analysis of the preparations for the introduction of the first pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy ( PIPAC) programme in the eastern part of Central Europe. Methods The study analysed the 14-month preparation period prior to the performance of the first PIPAC procedure with respect to: ( i) general preparations; ( ii) patient referral and qualification; ( iii) the first PIPAC procedure; ( iv) the 2 weeks following PIPAC programme establishment; and ( v) general problematic issues that arose. Results The length of time needed to prepare our institution for the first PIPAC procedure was extremely long compared with other European Union PIPAC centres: 14 months versus a standard 3-6 months of preparation. The longest amount of time ( 12 months) was required to prepare the required paperwork. Conclusions A new PIPAC programme was successfully established in the eastern part of Central Europe. The length of time to implement this method was significantly longer because of lengthy bureaucratic processes. These current findings should help new centres , especially in this part of Europe , to establish a PIPAC programme more quickly.
