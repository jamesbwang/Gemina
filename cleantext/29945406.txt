  To evaluate the clinical effects of manipulative reduction of cervical vertebrae combined with Pi needle release for the treatment of temporomandibular joint dysfunction. From March 2012 to May 2017 , 60 patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction were treated by manipulative reduction of cervical vertebrae with Pi needle release , including 26 males and 34 females , ranging in age from 18 to 60 years old , with an average of 32.5 years old. The courses of the disease ranged from 1 week to 5 years , with a mean duration of 3 months. The patients were followed up before and after treatment by maximum active opening of temporomandibular joint , joint clicking and comparison of visual analogue scale ( VAS) pain scores. All 60 patients were followed up , and the duration ranged from 6 to 24 months , with an average of 12 months. The maximum active opening of temporomandibular joint increased from ( 1.99 ± 0.47) cm before treatment to ( 3.17 ± 0.19) cm. The joint clicking decreased from 100 % before treatment to ( 27.33 ± 13.51) % after treatment. The VAS score decreased from 4.73 ± 0.67 before treatment to 1.80 ± 0.53 after treatment. Treatment of temporomandibular joint dysfunction by manipulative reduction of cervical vertebrae combined with Pi needle release has such advantages as easy operation , obvious curative effect , short course of treatment , which is an effective method for the treatment of temporomandibular joint dysfunction.
