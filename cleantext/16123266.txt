  We aimed to investigate the relationship between serum soluble Klotho protein ( sKlotho) level and coronary artery calcification ( CAC) as well as prognosis in patients with maintenance hemodialysis ( MHD). Overall , 128 adult patients with end-stage renal<symptom> failure<symptom> treated with MHD were collected in the Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children 's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University , Zhejiang Province , China in 2013. Serum sKlotho was detected by ELISA and coronary artery calcification was measured by multi-slice spiral computed tomography ( MSCT). With 36 months ' follow-up , death notes such as cause of death and death time were recorded. Patients were divided into low sKlotho group and high sKlotho group. Age , blood phosphorus level , hypertension incidence and incidence of diabetes mellitus of the patients in low sKlotho group was significantly higher than that of high sKlotho group ( SKlotho can increase the degree of CAC. Although MHD patients with low sKlotho level had shorter survival time , sKlotho is not an independent risk factor in prediction of prognosis of MHD patients.
