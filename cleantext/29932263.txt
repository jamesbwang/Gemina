  Carbohydrate-active enzymes ( CAZymes) are central to the biosynthesis and modification of the plant cell wall. An ancient clade of bifunctional plant endo-glucanases ( EG16 members) was recently revealed and proposed to represent a transitional group uniting plant xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase ( XTH) gene products and bacterial mixed-linkage endo-glucanases in the phylogeny of glycoside hydrolase family 16 ( GH16). To gain broader insights into the distribution and frequency of EG16 and other GH16 members in plants , the PHYTOZOME , PLAZA , NCBI and 1000 PLANTS databases were mined to build a comprehensive census among 1289 species , spanning the broad phylogenetic diversity of multiple algae<pathogen> through recent plant lineages. EG16 , newly identified EG16-2 and XTH members appeared first in the green algae<pathogen>. Extant EG16 members represent the early adoption of the Î²-jellyroll protein scaffold from a bacterial or early-lineage eukaryotic GH16 gene , which is characterized by loop deletion and extension of the N terminus ( in EG16-2 members) or C terminus ( in XTH members). Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of EG16 and EG16-2 sequences are directly concordant with contemporary estimates of plant evolution. The lack of expansion of EG16 members into multi-gene families across green plants may point to a core metabolic role under tight control , in contrast to XTH genes that have undergone the extensive duplications typical of cell-wall CAZymes. The present census will underpin future studies to elucidate the physiological role of EG16 members across plant species , and serve as roadmap for delineating the closely related EG16 and XTH gene products in bioinformatic analyses of emerging genomes and transcriptomes.
