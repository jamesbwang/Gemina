  This study aimed to assess if additional vertical bitewing ( VBW) and/or occlusal ( OC) radiographs may change initial judgment based only on periapical radiograph ( PAR) about the final position of orthodontic mini-implants ( OMI). Subjective and objective analyses were performed. Radiographic images of 26 OMI were divided into four groups: PAR , PAR+VBW , PAR+OC and ALL ( PAR+VBW+OC). For subjective analysis , five observers were asked to assess if the position of OMI was favorable to its success , using questionnaires with a four-point scale for responses: 1 = definitely not favorable , 2 = probably not favorable , 3 = probably favorable , or 4 = definitely favorable. Each group containing sets of images was presented to them in four different viewing sessions. Objective evaluation compared horizontal distances between OMI tip and the root nearest to the device in PAR and VBW. Most of observers ( 3 out of 5) changed their initial judgment based on PAR about OMI position when additional radiographs were analyzed. Differences between groups ( i.e. PAR vs. PAR+VBW; PAR vs. PAR+OC; and , PARvs.ALL) were statistically significant for these observers. For those that changed their judgment about OMI position , confidence level could significantly increase , decrease or even be maintained , not indicating a pattern. There was no agreement for distances between OMI tip and the root nearest to the device in PAR and VBW. Considering the limitations of the study , it is concluded that additional radiographic images may change the judgement about OMI final position without necessarily increasing the degree of certainty of such judgment.
