  This study evaluated the effect of different restorative techniques for non-carious cervical<symptom> lesions<symptom> ( NCCL) on polymerization shrinkage stress of resins using three-dimensional ( 3D) finite element analysis ( FEA). 3D-models of a maxillary premolar with a NCCL restored with different filling techniques ( bulk filling and incremental) were generated to be compared by nonlinear FEA. The bulk filling technique was used for groups B ( NCCL restored with Filtek ™ Bulk Fill) and C ( Filtek ™ Z350 XT). The incremental technique was subdivided according to mode of application: P ( 2 parallel increments of the Filtek ™ Z350 XT) , OI ( 2 oblique increments of the Filtek ™ Z350 XT , with incisal first) , OIV ( 2 oblique increments of the Filtek ™ Z350 XT , with incisal first and increments with the same volume) , OG ( 2 oblique increments of the Filtek ™ Z350 XT , with gingival first) and OGV ( 2 oblique increments of the Filtek ™ Z350 XT , with gingival first and increments with the same volume) , resulting in 7 models. All materials were considered isotropic , elastic and linear. The results were expressed in maximum principal stress ( MPS). The tension stress distribution was influenced by the restorative technique. The lowest stress concentration occurred in group B followed by OG , OGV , OI , OIV , P and C; the incisal interface was more affected than the gingival. The restoration of NCCLs with bulk fill composite resulted in lower shrinkage stress in the gingival and incisal areas , followed by incremental techniques with the initial increment placed on the gingival wall. The non-carious cervical<symptom> lesions<symptom> ( NCCLs) restored with bulk fill composite have a more favorable biomechanical behavior.
