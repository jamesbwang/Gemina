  The exploration and comparison of genome organization is routinely used in the frame of genomic and phylogenomic analyses. As a consequence , in the past few years , various tools allowing visualizing genomic contexts have been developed. However , their use is often hampered by a lack of flexibility , particularly concerning databases , input formats and figure customization. Here we present GeneSpy , a graphical user interface that allows the visualization and dynamic exploration of eukaryotic and prokaryotic annotated genomes. GeneSpy relies on user-friendly manageable local databases and allows the easy customization and production of figures in a multitude of formats. GeneSpy is freely available at https://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/GeneSpy/ for Linux , Mac OS and Windows under CeCILL license ( http://www.cecill.info/licences/). It is written in Python 2.7 and depends on Matplotlib , Tkinter and Sqlite libraries. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
