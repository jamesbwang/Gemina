  Traditionally , distal radius fractures ( DRFs) have been described using eponyms , e.g. Colles , Smith , Barton , Chauffeur. During the last half of the 20 Four observers , an intern , an orthopaedic registrar , an orthopaedic consultant and a radiology consultant , independently evaluated DRF radiograms and classified the fractures according to the AO/OTA , Frykman and Older classification systems. After an interval of 6 months , radiograms of 30 randomly chosen patients were re-evaluated by the same observers. Radiograms of 573 DRF patients were evaluated in the study. The inter-observer reliability of the AO/OTA fracture types ( A , B and C) was ` weak ' ( kappa = 0.45). The agreement dropped to ` minimal ' ( kappa = 0.24) regarding the AO/OTA groups ( A2 , A3 , B1 , B2 , B3 , C1 , C2 and C3). The reliability of the Frykman classification system was ` weak ' ( kappa = 0.41) , and we observed the lowest inter-observer reliability for the Older classification system ( kappa = 0.10). The kappa values for the intra-observer reproducibility of the AO/OTA fracture types ( A , B and C) ranged from 0.58 to 0.87. For the AO/OTA groups ( A2 , A3 , B1 , B2 , B3 , C1 , C2 and C3) the reproducibility was lower ranging from ` minimal ' to ` weak '. The intra-observer reproducibility of the Frykman system was ` weak ' to ` moderate ' and even worse for the Older classification system. Based on these findings the AO/OTA classification system seems to be most reliable for routine use , however , with lower kappa values concerning the agreement for the groups. The Frykman and Older classification systems can not be recommended because of less convincing results.
