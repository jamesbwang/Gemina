  This study was designed to evaluate the efficiency of medetomidine anesthesia for semen collection through urethral catheter in wild and captive jaguars. Six captive and five wild jaguars were chemically restrained with a combination of medetomidine ( 0.08-0.1 mg/kg) and ketamine ( 5 mg/kg). After medetomidine administration the urethra was catheterized using a urinary tomcat catheter ( 1 mm diameter × 130 mm length) to collect semen from all animals. By using this technique , we could collect an average of 347.2 μl of semen containing 2,635.2 sperm/ml. Forward progressive<symptom> motility<symptom> , sperm progressive<symptom> motility<symptom> , and sperm morphology analysis demonstrated that the methodology did not affect sperm quality. Thus , urethral catheterization after medetomidine administration is a practical and efficient method to collect high-quality semen from wild and captive jaguars; this will enable the development of reproductive assisted technologies for jaguars.
