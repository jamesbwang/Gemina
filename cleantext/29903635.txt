  To compare the quality of chest compressions performed according to the classical technique ( MT) versus a new technique ( NM) ( compression with 2thumbs with closed fists) in an infant manikin. A controlled , randomized cross-over study was carried out in professionals assisting pediatric patients. A University Hospital with a Pediatric ICU in the north of Spain. Residents and nurses in Pediatrics who had completed a basic and an advanced pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation course. Quantitative analysis of the variables referred to chest compression quality in a 2-minute cardiopulmonary resuscitation scenario in infants. Laerdal 's SimPad Mean rate and percentage of compressions in the recommended rate range , mean depth and percentage of compressions within the depth range of recommendations , percentage of compressions with adequate decompression , and percentage of compressions performed with the fingers in the center of the chest. Global quality of the compressions ( NM: 84.2 ± 23.7 % vs. MT: 80.1 ± 25.4 % ( p = 0.25; p = ns)) , percentage of compressions with correct depth ( NM: 59.9 ± 35.8 % vs. MT: 59.5 ± 35.7 % ( p = 0.76; p = ns)) , mean depth reached ( NM: 37.3 ± 3.8 mm vs. MT: 36 ± 5.3 mm ( p = 0.06; p = ns)) , percentage of complete re-expansion of the chest ( NM: 94.4 ± 9.3 % vs. MT: 92.4 ± 18.3 % ( p = 0.58; p = ns)) , and percentage of compressions with the recommended rate ( NM: 62.2 ± 34.6 % vs. MT: 51 ± 37.2 % ( p = 0.13; p = ns)) proved similar with both methods. The quality of chest compressions with the new method ( thumbs with closed fists) is similar to that afforded by the traditional method.
