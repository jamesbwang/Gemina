  A comprehensive analysis of the influence of the chiral auxiliary on the Î±-aminoxylation of titanium ( iv) enolates with TEMPO indicated that ( S) 4-tert-butyl-1-oxazolidine-2-thione is the most appropriate scaffold to provide a single diastereomer in high yields for a variety of substrates , which converts such a radical reaction into a highly chemo- and stereoselective oxidation.
