  A new competitive ligand has been synthesized for the preconcentration to obtain lower detection limits by using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction combined with slotted quartz tube-flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry ( DLLME-SQT-FAAS). The proposed method is simple , eco-friendly and has high sensitivity. The preconcentration procedure was optimized on the basis of various parameters affecting the complex formation and extraction efficiency such as pH and volume of buffer solution , volume of ligand solution , mixing period , volume and type of extraction solvent , volume and type of dispersive solvent , and salt effect. Instrumental parameters were also optimized to get higher sensitivity. Under the optimum conditions , the calibration graph was linear in the range of 10-250 ng mL
