  To investigate the relationship between molecular subtype , intraperitoneal ( IP) disease dissemination patterns , resectability , and overall survival ( OS) in advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer ( HGSOC). Patients undergoing primary surgery for stage III-IV HGSOC at Mayo Clinic from 1994 to 2011 were categorized into three IP disease dissemination patterns: upper abdominal or miliary; lower abdominal; and pelvic. Residual disease was defined as 0 ( RD0) , 0.1-0.5 , 0.6-1.0 , or > 1 cm. Molecular subtypes were derived from Agilent 4x44k tumor mRNA expression profiles and categorized as mesenchymal ( MES) or non-mesenchymal ( non-MES). Operative and molecular data was available for 334 patients. Median OS was shorter in patients with MES compared to non-MES subtypes ( 34.2 vs 44.6 months; P = 0.009). Patients with MES subtype were more likely to have upper abdominal/miliary disease compared to non-MES subtype ( 90 % vs. 72 % , P < 0.001). For patients with upper abdominal/miliary disease , complete resection ( RD0) was less common in MES compared to non-MES subtypes ( 11 % vs. 27 % , P = 0.004). On multivariable analysis , RD was the only factor associated with OS ( P < 0.001). In patients with upper abdominal/miliary disease , though less commonly achieved , RD0 improved survival irrespective of molecular subtype ( median OS of 69.2 and 57.9 months for MES and non-MES subtype). Our results support a paradigm in which molecular subtype is an important driver of dissemination pattern; this in turn impacts resectability and ultimately survival. Consequently mesenchymal subtype is associated with much lower rates of complete resection , though RD0 remains the most important independent predictor of survival.
