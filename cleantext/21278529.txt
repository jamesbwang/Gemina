  To assess patterns of research collaboration in orthodontics and possible relationships with sample size and funding status. Orthodontic randomised and non-randomised controlled clinical trials published between 2013 and 2017 were identified through electronic searching. The nature of collaboration , author institutions , study setting , sample size , and funding status were assessed. Linear and logistic regression analyses were applied. Of 1153 studies , 217 met the selection criteria. The majority of studies were authored by university academics ( 86 %) , were conducted in a single centre ( 71.9 %) and in at least one university hospital ( 68.2 %). The number of practice-based trials ( 10.1 %) , as well as the involvement of specialist practitioners ( 5.2 %) in co-authorship , was limited. Multi-centred studies within a single country were associated with a significantly larger sample size compared to single-centred trials ( P = 0.00; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 33.59 , 106.93). However , authorship collaboration either nationally ( odds ratio ( OR) 2.37; 95 % CI 0.85 , 6.57) or internationally across different continents ( OR 5.54; 95 % CI 0.62 , 49.52) did not translate into increased funding. Most orthodontic studies were undertaken in university hospital settings within a single country. Collaboration is common in orthodontics but involvement of practice settings remains limited , suggesting a need for stimulation of practice-based research and research partnerships.
