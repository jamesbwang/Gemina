  Since the inception of modern social evolution theory , a vast majority of studies have sought to explain cooperation using relatedness-driven hypotheses. Natural populations , however , show a substantial amount of variation in social behaviour that is uncorrelated with relatedness. Age offers a major alternative explanation for variation in behaviour that remains unaccounted for. Most natural populations are structured into age-classes , with ageing being a nearly universal feature of most major taxa , including eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. Despite this , the theoretical underpinnings of age-dependent social behaviour remain limited. Here , I investigate how group age-composition , demography and life history shape trajectories of age-dependent behaviours that are expressed conditionally on an actor and recipient 's age. I show that demography introduces novel age-dependent selective pressures acting on social phenotypes. Furthermore , I find that life history traits influence the costs and benefits of cooperation directly , but also indirectly. Life history has a strong impact not only on the genetic structure of the population but also on the distribution of group age-compositions , with both of these processes influencing the expression of age-dependent cooperation. Age of peak reproductive performance , in particular , is of chief importance for the evolution of cooperation , as this will largely determine the age and relatedness of social partners. Moreover , my results suggest that later-life reproductive senescence may occur because of demographic effects alone , which opens new vistas on the evolution of menopause and related phenomena.
