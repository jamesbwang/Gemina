  Synthetic biology ( SynBio) represents a relatively young field of research which has developed into an important scientific endeavour. Characterised by a high degree of interdisciplinary work crossing disciplinary boundaries , such as biology , mathematics and engineering , SynBio has been , since its beginning , devoted to creating new biological functions , metabolic pathways or even minimal organisms. Although its often-articulated aim of developing new forms of life has so far not been archived , SynBio nowadays represents a well-established biotechnological approach and it has also attracted public concern , especially since Craig Venter 's work on Mycoplasma<pathogen> Mycoides<pathogen> JCVI-syn1.0. Taking these developments as a starting point , the paper empirically investigates the metaphorical representations of SynBio in two leading German media publications , the daily newspaper Die Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and the weekly magazine Der Spiegel between 2000 and 2010. Using a novel combination of metaphor and co-occurrence analysis , the paper engages in a systematic examination of implicit moral implications inherent in linguistic images permeating this news coverage. It demonstrates a method of how media-metaphorical representations and their moral implications of SynBio could analytically be revealed and analysed. In doing so , it aims at contributing to empirical ethical analyses of the news coverage on SynBio in particular and offers an approach that methodologically adds to literature on responsible language use , which is emerging in science and technology studies and ethical analyses of new technologies.
