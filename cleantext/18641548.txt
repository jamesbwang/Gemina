  Among atypical antipsychotics , quetiapine is commonly prescribed and considered to have a favorable side effect and safety profile. Here , we report the case of a patient who developed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure<symptom> 28 hours following ingestion of 1,400 mg of quetiapine. Review of the literature identifies delayed-onset seizure<symptom> as a potential complication of quetiapine overdose. Unique to this case , delayed-onset seizures<symptom> occurred in a patient with a relatively low dose of quetiapine and no obvious toxidrome , suggesting that this reaction may be an important consideration in the management of quetiapine overdose. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of quetiapine may explain this unusual phenomenon.
