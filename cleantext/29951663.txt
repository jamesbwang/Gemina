  We report the synthesis and characterization of the first fluorescent oxalato-based canted antiferromagnet. Compound ( DOC) ( MnFe ( C2O4) 3) ( 1) ( DOC = 3,3 '- diethyloxacarbocyanine) combines the well-known canted antiferromagnetic ( MnFe ( C2O4) 3)- honeycomb layers with a fluorescent cationic cyanine-type fluorescent dye. Besides the expected spin canted antiferromagnetic order in the oxalato layer at ca. 29 K , we show the key role played by the anionic oxalato lattice in the optical properties of the cation since it provides isolation of dye cations in the hexagonal cavities of the oxalato-based matrix. The emission of the DOC + dye shows a redshift and a broadening of the emission as well as an increase in the lifetime compared to the emission of the DOC + cations in solution. These facts are attributed to the isolation effect of the oxalato-based matrix.
