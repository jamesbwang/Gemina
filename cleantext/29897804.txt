  The transmission of many animal and plant diseases relies on the behavior of arthropod vectors. In particular , the specific preference for infected or uninfected hosts observed in many vector species is expected to affect the circulation of vector-borne diseases. Here I develop a theoretical framework to study the epidemiology and evolution of the manipulation of host choice behavior of vectors. I show that vector preference strategies have dramatic epidemiological consequences. I also explore the evolution of vector host choice under different scenarios regarding control of the vector behavior by the pathogen. This analysis yields multiple evolutionary outcomes and explains the diversity of host choice behaviors observed in a broad range of vector-borne diseases. In particular , this analysis helps us understand why several pathogens have evolved manipulation strategies that vary with the infectious status of their vector species while other pathogens seem unable to evolve such complex conditional strategies. I argue that contrasting the behavior of infected and uninfected vectors is key to revealing the mechanistic constraints acting on the evolution of the manipulation of vector behavior.
