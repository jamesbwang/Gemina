  Despite being recognised and reported in the literature for decades , subungual melanoma of the foot remains a diagnostic pitfall , with it commonly being mistaken for benign conditions. We present an interesting case of delayed diagnosis of subungual melanoma of the hallux that was misdiagnosed in the community for over one year. With melanoma being the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in Australia in 2013 , this case serves as a reminder to all clinicians about the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for melanoma of the foot.
