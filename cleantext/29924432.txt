  Starting from natural (-)- limonene , a limonene-based aminodiol library was created whereas the reaction of aminodiols with formaldehyde resulted in bicyclic monoterpene-fused spirooxazolidines in N-substituent dependent regio-selective ring closures. The aminodiol derivatives were applied as chiral catalysts in the addition of diethylzinc to benzaldehyde. The N-substituent-dependent ring closure was explained by comparative DFT modelling.
