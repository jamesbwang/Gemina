  Distraction-based techniques allow spinal growth until skeletal maturity while preventing curve progression. Two multicenter early-onset scoliosis databases were used to identify patients with idiopathic spine abnormalities treated with traditional growing rods ( TGR) or vertically expandable titanium ribs ( VEPTR). Patients underwent at least 4 lengthenings and had at least 5-year follow-up. Significance was set at P < 0.05. In total , 50 patients treated with TGR and 22 treated with VEPTR were included. Mean ( ± SD) age at surgery was 5.5 ( ± 2.0) years for the TGR group versus 4.3 ( ± 1.9) years for the VEPTR group ( P = 0.044); other demographic parameters were similar. VEPTR patients had more procedures ( mean 15 ± 4.2) than TGR patients ( mean 10 ± 4.0) ( P = 0.001). Unilateral constructs were present in 18 % ( 4 of 22) of VEPTR and 16 % ( 8 of 50) of TGR patients. Bilateral constructs spanned a mean 2.1 additional surgical levels and exposed patients to 1.6 fewer procedures than unilateral constructs. Curve correction was similar between bilateral and unilateral constructs. TGR patients experienced greater curve correction ( 50 %) than VEPTR patients ( 27 %) ( P < 0.001) and achieved a greater percentage of thoracic height gain ( 24 %) than VEPTR patients ( 12 %) ( P = 0.024). At latest follow-up , TGR patients had better maintenance of curve correction , less kyphosis , and 15 % greater absolute gain in thoracic height versus VEPTR patients. TGR patients had a lower rate of wound<disease> complications ( 14 %) than VEPTR patients ( 41 %) ( P = 0.011). In patients with idiopathic early-onset scoliosis , TGRs produced greater initial curve correction , greater thoracic height gains , less kyphosis , and lower incidence of wound<disease> complications compared with VEPTR. Level III.
