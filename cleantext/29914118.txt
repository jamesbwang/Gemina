  Deltamethrin is widely used in pest prevention and control such as red spiders , aphids , and grubs in strawberry. It is important to accurately monitor whether the deltamethrin residue in strawberry exceeds the standard. In this paper , density functional theory ( DFT) was used to theoretically analyze the molecular structure of deltamethrin , gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs) and silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs) were used to enhance the surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy ( SERS) detection signal. As a result , the theoretical Raman peaks of deltamethrin calculated by DFT were basically similar to the measured results , and the enhancing effects based on AuNPs was better than that of AgNPs.
