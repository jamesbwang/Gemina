  Cystic spinal dysraphism of the cervical region is a relatively rare entity , which is more frequently associated with congenital anomalies such as split cord malformation , Chiari malformation , and corpus callosum agenesis , when compared to their lumbosacral counterpart. In our study , we have highlighted the clinical spectrum , associated anomalies ( both neural and extra-neural) , and surgical nuances of these. This study is a retrospective analysis of 225 patients from June 2010 to April 2017. Twelve patients who were between the age of 1 month and 16 years were included in our study. Average age was 32.6 months , and there were five female patients and seven male patients. All patients underwent neurological and radiological examinations followed by surgical excision of the sac and exploration of the intradural sac using the standard microsurgical technique. Neurological , Orthopedic and urological outcomes were studied in our description. Of the 12 cases , 9 patients ( 75 %) had some associated anomaly. Four of the 12 patients ( 25 %) had split cord malformation , 3 had corpus callosum agenesis , and 5 had Chiari malformation. Patients with cervical spina bifida cystica ( SBC) present with less neurologic deficits and greater association with CCA. The management strategy and association with other congenital anomalies separates cervical dysraphism as a different clinical entity rather than just group. These patients rather show favorable outcome with regard to neurologic , orthopedic , and urologic problems as compared to their caudal counterpart. Early surgical intervention even before the onset of symptoms is recommended. A proper radiological and urological evaluation is warranted.
