  Avian leukosis virus subgroup J ( ALV-J) is an oncogenic retrovirus that causes immunosuppression and enhances susceptibility to secondary infection , resulting in great economic losses. Although ALV-J-induced immunosuppression has been well established , the underlying molecular mechanism for such induction is still unclear. Here , we report that the inhibitory effect of ALV-J infection on type I interferon expression is associated with the down-regulation of transcriptional regulator NF-κB in host cells. We found that ALV-J possess the inhibitory effect on type I interferon production in HD11 cells and that ALV-J causes the up-regulation of IκBα and down-regulation of NF-κB p65 , and that ALV-J blocks the phosphorylation of IκBα on Ser32/36 amino acid residues. Collectively , our findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of ALV-J.
