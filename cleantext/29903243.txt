  By analyzing the levels of hemoglobin , vitamin A and vitamin D in Chinese rural pregnant women during 2010-2012 , the changes of the prevalence of anemia<symptom> were evaluated , and the nutritional status of vitamin A and vitamin D were evaluated. All the data in this study came from the China Nutrition and Health Survey in 2010-2012. By using multi-stage stratified sampling and population proportional stratified random sampling method , pregnant women from 45 ordinary ruralareas and 30 poor rural areas were included in this study. 1 763 cases of blood hemoglobin concentration were determined by cyanmethemoglobin method. 601 cases of retinol level were determined by high performance liquid chromatography method. 979 cases of 25-hydroxy vitamin D level were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The level of blood hemoglobin and the prevalence of anemia<symptom> , the level of vitamin A and the prevalence of VAD , the level of vitamin D and the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency were analyzed. In 2010-2012 , the level of blood hemoglobin of Chinese city pregnant women was 123. 60 ( 113. 80-133. 50) g/L , 123. 10 ( 114. 00-132. 20) g/L for ordinary rural area and 125. 40 ( 113. 30-136. 80) g/L for poor rural area. The level of blood hemoglobin of ordinary rural area was statistically higher than that of poor rural area ( P = 0. 020). The anemia<symptom> prevalence of Chinese rural pregnant women was 17. 58 % , 16. 10 % for ordinary rural area and 20. 19 % for poor rural area. Statistically difference was found between different areas ( P = 0. 029). The level of vitamin A of Chinese rural pregnant women was 1. 53 ( 1. 18-1. 98) Î¼mol/L. The prevalence of VAD of Chinese county pregnant women was 3. 49 % , the marginal deficiency rate was 12. 81 %. The level of vitamin D of Chinese city pregnant women was 15. 55 ( 11. 94-19. 90) ng/m L. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency of Chinese rural pregnant women was up to 75. 38 % , 65. 36 % for ordinary rural area and 87. 42 % for poor rural area. Significant difference was observed in the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency between ordinary and poor rural areas ( P < 0. 001). The prevalence of anemia<symptom> in Chinese rural pregnant women improve from 2002 to 2012 , but still higher than other populations. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women is generally more serious , while there is a certain percentage of vitamin A marginal deficiency.
