  Baige ( BG) is a compound Chinese herbal preparation , constituted of different position extracts ( ethanol extracts from Pueraria lobate and SFE-CO The goal of this study was to identify the neuroprotective properties of BG and its principal component mixture ( PCM) and verify whether the material basis for BG is its PCM. Middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO) was operated on male Sprague-Dawley rat for 2 h , different doses of BG or PCM or vehicle were gavaged after 3 h of MCAO. Rats were sacrificed after 30 days treatment. Blood serum inflammation<symptom> factors and NGF were detected by ELISA. After 30 days of treatment , both BG and PCM interventions reduced the infarct volume , modified neurological severity score ( mNSS) in rats , declined IL-1Î² and IL-6 levels in the serum , increased NGF level in the serum and recovered the number of Nissl body in injured brain. Both BG and PCM exert equivalent levels of recovery effect in MCAO on rats; and PCM is the material foundation of BG. This recovery effect is associated with inflammatory inhibition and NGF production.
