  An important characteristic of chickens is that the antibody repertoire is based on a single framework , with diversity found mainly in the CDRs of the light and heavy chain variable regions. Despite this apparent limitation in the antibody repertoire , high-affinity antibodies can be raised to a wide variety of targets , including those that are highly conserved. Transgenic chickens have previously been generated that express a humanized antibody repertoire , with a single framework that incorporates diversity by the process of gene conversion , as in wild-type chickens. Here , we compare the sequences and antibodies that are generated purely by gene conversion/somatic hypermutation of a pre-rearranged heavy chain , with the diversity obtained by V ( D) J rearrangement followed by gene conversion and somatic hypermutation. In a gene converting species , CDR-H3 lengths are more variable with V ( D) J rearrangement , but similar levels of amino acid diversity are obtainable with gene conversion/somatic hypermutation alone.
