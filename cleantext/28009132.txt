  As gene-based therapies may soon arise for patients with spinocerebellar ataxia<symptom> ( SCA) , there is a critical need to identify biomarkers of disease progression with effect sizes greater than clinical scores , enabling trials with smaller sample sizes. We enrolled a unique cohort of patients with SCA1 ( Clinical scores worsened as atrophy increased over time ( This study showed that volumetry outperformed clinical scores to measure disease progression in SCA1 , SCA2 , SCA3 and SCA7. Therefore , we advocate the use of volumetric biomarkers in therapeutic trials of autosomal dominant ataxias<symptom>. In addition , FBA showed larger effect size than DTI to detect cross-sectional microstructural alterations in patients relative to controls.
