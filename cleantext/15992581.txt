  Sepsis<disease> remains the leading cause of high mortality and huge financial burden in intensive care units ( ICU) , but with scarce effective treatments due to refractory multiple organ dysfunction and persistent immunosuppression. Treatments that aim at modulating immune function and attenuating multiple organ injury will certainly benefit septic cases. Alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( α7nAchR) has been reported with potent immunomodulatory properties in various diseases as the essential mediator of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway ( CAP). Few studies have demonstrated the potential effect of central α7nAchR on the progression and prognosis of septic response , while its expression was first discovered on neurons and most abundant in the central nervous system. In the present study , it was found severe damage of multiple organs under the operation of cecal ligation and puncture ( CLP) in rats , including heart , liver , kidneys , and lungs , as evidenced by abnormal histomorphology and notable elevation of injury markers. Concurrently , the function of spleen CD4
