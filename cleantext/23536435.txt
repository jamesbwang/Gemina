  Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas ( DIPGs) are incurable childhood brain tumors , whereby the standard of care is focal radiation , a treatment that provides temporary relief for most patients. Surprisingly , decades of clinical trials have failed to identify additional therapies that can prolong survival in this disease. In this conference manuscript , we discuss how genetic engineered mouse modeling techniques with the use of a retroviral gene delivery system can help dissect the complex pathophysiology of this disease. With this approach , autochthonous murine DIPG models can be readily induced to ( 1) help interrogate the function of novel genetic alterations in tumorigenesis , ( 2) identify candidate cells of origin for this disease , ( 3) address how region-specific differences in the central nervous system influence the process of gliomagenesis , and ( 4) evaluate novel therapeutics in an immunocompetent model.
