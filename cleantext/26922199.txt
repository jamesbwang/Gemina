  Homocysteine ( HCY) interferes with collagen cross-linking in bones and stimulates osteoclast activity. The activated osteoclasts secrete cathepsin K ( CathK) , a cysteine protease , in eminent quantity during bone resorption. Hyperhomocysteinemia may effect bone mineral density ( BMD) through CathK. We , therefore , examined the relation between HCY and BMD along with CathK , 25-hydroxyvit-D ( 25 ( OH) D , intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH) , and Vitamin B12. We recruited a total of 93 postmenopausal women between the age group of 45-60 years , attending the Endocrinology outpatient department at King George 's Medical University , Lucknow. BMD was done by DXA scan using Hologic QDR1000 system. Based on the WHO criteria , patients were segregated into three groups as follows; normal bone mass , osteopenia , and osteoporosis. All women underwent routine biochemical laboratory parameters , HCY , Vitamin B12 , and CathK levels. Among 93 postmenopausal women , 56 % ( 52) had osteoporosis. Nineteen percent ( 18) had normal BMD ( mean age , 53.22 ± 8.5 years) and 23 ( 25 %) had osteopenia ( mean age 52.86 ± 6.67 years). The mean age in the osteoporetic group was 56.2 ± 6.9 years. The median ( interquartile range) levels of HCY in the three groups were 14.5 μmol/L ( 12.2-24.7) , 15.05 μmol/L ( 12.1-19.9) and 13.2 μmol/L ( 10.3-17.0) , respectively. CathK levels were similar in three groups 7.6 ng/ml ( 7.0-80.5) , 8.3 ng/ml ( 7.3-8.5) , and 8.6 ng/ml ( 7.2-8.9). Both HCY and CathK were found positively associated with serum phosphorus ( Low bone mass by DXA is a significant problem in postmenopausal females. HCY and CathK do not reliably correlate with bone loss in postmenopausal women although phosphorus metabolism may play a role.
