  To compare fractional flow reserve ( FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio ( iFR) measurements in an all-comer patient population with moderate coronary artery stenoses. Visual assessment of the severity of coronary artery stenoses is often discordant in moderate lesions<symptom>. FFR allows reliable functional severity assessment in these cases but requires adenosine-induced hyperaemia with associated additional time , costs and side effects. The iFR is a hyperaemia-independent index. Between November 2015 and February 2017 , 356 consecutive patients were included in whom 515 coronary stenoses were measured using both iFR and FFR. Mean iFR and FFR were 0.90 ± 0.09 and 0.86 ± 0.08 , respectively. iFR correlated well with FFR ( r = 0.75; p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified an area under the curve of 0.92. An iFR-only strategy with a treatment cut-off ≤ 0.89 revealed a diagnostic classification agreement with the FFR-only strategy in 420 lesions<symptom> ( 82 %) with a sensitivity of 87 % , a specificity of 80 % , a positive predictive value of 56 % and a negative predictive value of 96 %. Real-time iFR measurements have good negative predictive value compared to FFR , but moderate diagnostic accuracy ( 82 %). It exposes fewer patients to adenosine , reduces procedure time and costs. Further prospective trials are needed to evaluate specific clinical settings , cut-off values and endpoints.
