  The guidelines for the insertion and maintenance of the central venous catheter ( CVC) in children on long-term parenteral nutrition ( PN) were published 12 years ago and studies evaluating the outcomes are limited. Therefore , the aim of this study was to perform a survey about criteria for CVC insertion and maintenance in intestinal failure/rehabilitation centres treating children on home PN. An on-line cross-sectional survey based on previous European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology , Hepatology and Nutrition ( ESPGHAN) PN guidelines was distributed electronically to the members of the ESPGHAN networking group , Network for Intestinal Failure and Transplantation in Europe ( NITE) and tertiary paediatric gastroenterology centres in Europe. Overall , 55 responses from 49 centres in 18 European countries and Israel were collected. The majority of respondents were from the United Kingdom ( 10 , 19 %) , followed by Germany ( 7 , 13 %) and France ( 6 , 11 %). Eleven centres ( 21 %) cared for more than 30 patients , 8 ( 15 %) centres between 20 to 30 patients , 18 ( 34 %) centres between 10-20 patients and 16 ( 30 %) less than 10 patients on home PN. There was a high variability in the majority of answers to the cross-sectional survey. CVC insertion and maintenance in children on home PN varies largely amongst centres in Europe. These differences could be at least partially explained by the lack of up-dated guidelines and limited evidence. There is an urgent need for collaborative research to make recommendations about the best possible practice.
