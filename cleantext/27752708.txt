  CD74 is a multifunctional protein and a receptor for Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor ( MIF) and MIF-2/ D-dopachrome tautomerase ( DDT) cytokines , upregulated in diabetic kidney disease. However , the drivers of CD74 expression and DDT function in kidney cells are poorly characterized. TWEAK is a proinflammatory cytokine that promotes kidney injury. We have now identified CD74 gene expression as upregulated in the kidneys in response to systemic TWEAK administration in mice , and have characterized the in vivo CD74 expression and the functional consequences in cultured cells. TWEAK administration to mice resulted in a progressive time-dependent ( up to 24h) upregulation of kidney CD74 mRNA ( RT-PCR) and protein ( Western blot). Furthermore , the CD74 ligands MIF and DDT were also upregulated at the protein level 24h after TWEAK administration. Immunohistochemistry localized the increased CD74 , MIF and DDT expression to tubular cells. In cultured tubular cells , TWEAK increased CD74 mRNA and protein expression dose-dependently , with a temporal pattern similar to in vivo. TWEAK-induced CD74 localized to the cell membrane , where it can function as a cytokine receptor. For the first time , we explored the actions of DDT in tubular cells and found that DDT amplified the increase in MCP-1 and RANTES expression in response to TWEAK. By contrast , DDT did not significantly modify TWEAK-induced Klotho downregulation. In conclusion , TWEAK upregulates CD74 and its ligands MIF and DDT in renal tubular cells. This may have functional consequences for kidney injury since DDT amplified the inflammatory response to TWEAK.
