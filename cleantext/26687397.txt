  Aluminum and mercury are common neurotoxic contaminants in our environment- from the air we breathe to the water that we drink to the foods that we eat. It is remarkable that to date neither of these two well-established environmental neurotoxins ( i.e. those having a general toxicity towards brain cells) and genotoxins ( those agents which exhibit directed toxicity toward the genetic apparatus) have been critically studied , nor have their neurotoxicities been evaluated in human neurobiology or in cells of the human central nervous system ( CNS). In this paper we report the effects of added aluminum ( sulfate; Al ₂ ( SO ₄) ₃) and/or mercury ( sulfate; HgSO
