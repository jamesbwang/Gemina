  The technologies and innovations applicable to endovascular treatment for complex aortic pathologies have progressed rapidly over the last two decades. Although the initial outcomes of an endovascular aortic repair have been excellent , as long-term data became available , complications including endoleaks , endograft migration , and endograft infection have become apparent and are of concern. Previously , the indication for endovascular therapy was restricted to descending thoracic aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease> and abdominal aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease>. However , its indication has expanded along with the improvement of techniques and devices , and currently , it has become possible to treat pararenal aortic<disease> aneurysms<disease> and Crawford type 4 thoracoabdominal aortic<disease> aneurysm<disease> ( TAAA) using the off-the-shelf devices. Additionally , custom-made devices allow for the treatment of arch or more extensive TAAAs. Endovascular treatment is applied not only to aneurysms<disease> but also to acute/chronic dissections. However , long-term outcomes are still unclear. This article provides an overview of available devices and the results of endovascular treatment for various aortic pathologies.
