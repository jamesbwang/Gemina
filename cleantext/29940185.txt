  Prokaryotic adaptive immune systems use CRISPRs ( Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) and CRISPR associated ( Cas) proteins for RNA-guided cleavage of foreign genetic elements. The focus of this review , Type VI CRISPR-Cas systems , include a single protein known as Cas13 ( formerly C2c2) , that when assembled with a crRNA forms a crRNA-guided RNA-targeting effector complex. Type VI CRISPR-Cas systems can be divided into four subtypes ( A-D) based on Cas13 phylogeny. All Cas13 proteins studied to date possess two enzymatically distinct ribonuclease activities that are required for optimal interference. One RNase is responsible for pre-crRNA processing to form mature Type VI interference complexes , while the other RNase activity provided by the two HEPN ( Higher Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes Nucleotide-binding) domains , is required for degradation of target RNA during viral interference. In this review , I will compare and contrast what is known about the molecular architecture and behavior of Type VI ( A-D) CRISPR-Cas13 interference complexes , how this allows them to carry out their RNA-targeting function , how Type VI accessory proteins are able to modulate Cas13 activity , and how together all of these features have led to the rapid development of a range of RNA-targeting applications. Throughout I will also discuss some of the outstanding questions regarding Cas13 's molecular behavior , and its role in bacterial adaptive immunity and RNA-targeting applications.
