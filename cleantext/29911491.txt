  Nowadays , fixed gear competitions on outdoor circuits such as criteriums are regularly organized worldwide. To date , no study has investigated this alternative form of cycling. The purpose of the present study was to examine fixed gear performance indexes and to characterize physiological determinants of fixed gear cyclists. This study was carried out in two parts. Part 1 ( n = 36) examined correlations between performance indexes obtained during a real fixed gear criterium ( time trial , fastest laps , averaged lap time during races , fatigue<symptom> indexes) and during a sprint track time trial. Part 2 ( n = 9) examined correlations between the recorded performance indexes and some aerobic and anaerobic performance outputs ( VO
