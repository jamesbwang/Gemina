  A straightforward Lewis acid-promoted protocol for 3,3 '- bisindolylmethanes ( BIMs) synthesis via reductive alkylation of indoles at C3 position with carboxylic acids in the presence of hydrosilane was developed for the first time. Instead of aldehydes , more readily available , stable , and facilely handling carboxylic acids have been employed as alternative alkylating agents. As an efficient organocatalyst , B ( C6F5) 3 enables the reductive alkylation of various substituted indole derivatives with carboxylic acids with up to 98 % yield at room temperature and under neat conditions. This metal-free strategy offers an alternative approach for the direct functionalization of indoles to BIMs with carboxylic acids and such protocol allows selective reduction of carboxylic acid to aldehyde in combination with C-C bond formation.
