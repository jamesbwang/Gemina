  Acrolein , a highly reactive α,β-unsaturated aldehyde , is a toxic component of cigarette smoke. As a lipid peroxidation biomarker , acrolein plays an important role in a wide variety of disease states , such as neurodegenerative , Alzheimer 's disease , diabetes and atherosclerosis. Endothelial cell injury is one of the initiating factors of atherosclerosis , but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Our study primarily focused on acrolein-induced autophagy-dependent apoptosis and the possible molecular mechanism. The results showed that treatment with acrolein increased the number of intracellular GFP-LC3 II punctuates and the expression of autophagosome biomarker LC3-II , with the low dose ( 25 μM) or at the early stage of treatment ( 3 h). Following treatment of EAhy926 cells with acrolein for 6 h , lysosomal permeabilization changed , and cathepsin B ( CB) was released. Additionally , acrolein induced the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential , and cytochrome c was released. Furthermore , caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation showed that acrolein induced EAhy926 cell apoptosis. Autophagy inhibitor 3MA and CB inhibitor CA-074 Me ( CA) attenuated acrolein-induced apoptosis. Collectively , our results suggested that acrolein-induced apoptosis is autophagy-dependent , occurring via injury to lysosomes and mitochondria. This study provides new mechanistic insight toward understanding the pathogenesis of acrolein-related disorders.
