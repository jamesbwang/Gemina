  An outbreak of HPAIV H5N1<pathogen> in Nakhon Sawan province , Thailand , in 2004 caused sporadic deaths of Asian openbill storks ( Anastomus oscitans). An investigation was undertaken to determine if this virus occurs and circulates in wild birds in Nakhon Sawan province. Following the outbreak , a widespread serosurvey was conducted using the hemagglutination inhibition assay and microneutralization assay to detect antibodies against AIV H5. From 2007 to 2014 , blood was collected from a total of 753 wild birds , representing 10 orders and 44 species. The results reveal that 10 serum samples were positive for AIV H5 antibodies. These seropositive results , found in the orders Ciconiiformes and Anseriformes , demonstrate that waterfowl serve as a reservoir host of AIV. Moreover , the seroprevalences in streak-eared bulbul showed habitat sharing with waterfowl or duck.
