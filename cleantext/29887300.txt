  We conducted a systematic review of the use of continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM) in older patients , in order to consolidate the growing evidence base in this area. Our protocol was registered on PROSPERO ( CRD42017068523). We searched SCI Web of Science , Ovid SP MEDLINE and EMBASE from January 2010 to June 2017 for observational studies and randomized controlled trial of CGM in older patients ( mean age 65 or older) with diabetes. We excluded studies that involved only hospitalized patients. Two reviewers independently extracted data blood sugar values ( in particular , hypoglycemic episodes) captured with the use of CGM. We also assessed adverse events and acceptability of CGM. After screening 901 abstracts , we included nine studies with a total of 989 older patients with diabetes. The CGM studies reveal that hypoglycemic episodes were occurring in a sizeable proportion ( 28-65 %) of participants. Most ( 80-100 %) of these episodes were asymptomatic , with some patients spending nearly 2 h per day in the hypoglycemic range. Older people with diabetes found CGM acceptable and experienced improved health-related well-being. CGM frequently picks up asymptomatic hypoglycemic episodes in older patients with diabetes. Users of CGM report improved well-being , and reduction of diabetes-related stress.
