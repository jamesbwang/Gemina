  Identification of participants at clinical high-risk ( CHR) for the development of psychosis is an important objective of current preventive efforts in mental health research. However , the utility of using web-based screening approaches to detect CHR participants at the population level has not been investigated. We tested a web-based screening approach to identify CHR individuals. Potential participants were invited to a website via e-mail invitations , flyers , and invitation letters involving both the general population and mental health services. Two thousand two hundred seventy-nine participants completed the 16-item version of the prodromal questionnaire ( PQ-16) and a 9-item questionnaire of perceptual and cognitive aberrations ( PCA) for the assessment of basic symptoms ( BS) online. 52.3 % of participants met a priori cut-off criteria for the PQ and 73.6 % for PCA items online. One thousand seven hundred eighty-seven participants were invited for a clinical interview and n = 356 interviews were conducted ( response rate: 19.9 %) using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental State ( CAARMS) and the Schizophrenia Proneness Interview , Adult Version ( SPI-A). n = 101 CHR participants and n = 8 first-episode psychosis ( FEP) were detected. ROC curve analysis revealed good to moderate sensitivity and specificity for predicting CHR status based on online results for both UHR and BS criteria ( sensitivity/specificity: PQ-16 = 82 %/ 46 %; PCA = 94 %/ 12 %). Selection of a subset of 10 items from both PQ-16 and PCA lead to an improved of specificity of 57 % while only marginally affecting sensitivity ( 81 %). CHR participants were characterized by similar levels of functioning and neurocognitive deficits as clinically identified CHR groups. These data provide evidence for the possibility to identify CHR participants through population-based web screening. This could be an important strategy for early intervention and diagnosis of psychotic disorders.
