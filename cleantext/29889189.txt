  This article explores a method to detect differences in visual perception in humans. The method used is based on the psychological ( or `` cognitive '') function of eyeblinks. Participants ' eyeblinks are detected and acquired while watching videos specifically created for the investigation. The detection and acquisition of eyeblinks are carried out with the help of a 20-channel electroencephalographic ( EEG) wireless device. The international 10-20 system for electrode placement is followed. A high-definition ( HD) video camera is used to record participants ' facial expressions , for contrast purposes. Instead of using pre-existing media content , purpose-made video content has been created following specific criteria of interest for this investigation , with stimuli enabling researchers to manage the precise parameters of interest. Otherwise , results could be contaminated with uncontrolled variables. The synchronization of the presentation of video stimuli with EEG recordings needs to be done in milliseconds. Analysis of collected data is performed with robust software for working with big matrices. Statistically significant differences in eyeblink rate related to media professionalization and editing style are found with the reported experimental procedures.
