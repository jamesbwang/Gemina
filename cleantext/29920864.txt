  How can education optimize transmission of knowledge while also fostering further learning? Focusing on children at the cusp of formal schooling ( N = 180 , age = 4.0-6.0 y) , we investigate learning after direct instruction by a knowledgeable teacher , after questioning by a knowledgeable teacher , and after questioning by a naïve informant. Consistent with previous findings , instruction by a knowledgeable teacher allows effective information transmission but at the cost of exploration and further learning. Critically , we find a dual benefit for questioning by a knowledgeable teacher: Such pedagogical questioning both effectively transmits knowledge and fosters exploration and further learning , regardless of whether the question was directed to the child or directed to a third party and overheard by the child. These effects are not observed when the same question is asked by a naïve informant. We conclude that a teacher 's choice of pedagogical method may differentially influence learning through their choices of how , and how not , to present evidence , with implications for transmission of knowledge and self-directed discovery.
