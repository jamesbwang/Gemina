  The biological background and consequences of serotonin transporter polymorphism-glucocorticoid relationship in individual differences in stress reactivity has been a major interest in neuropsychiatry research. Individual differences in glucocorticoid release have long been implicated in vulnerability to stress-related psychopathologies , like depression<symptom> and anxiety<symptom> in various species. Yet , it is largely elusive to what extent results from non-human primates and rodents translate to human findings. Based on our structured , comprehensive and non-hypothesis driven overview of this topic , we conclude that although gene-environment interaction studies have highlighted the importance of serotonin transporter polymorphism in modulating glucocorticoid release , there is compelling evidence that age , gender and ethnicity are significant factors too contributing to the equation. We conclude too that the way early life events modulate an individual 's stress reactivity as a function of serotonin transporter polymorphism is comparable between species. These data provide a rationale for the design of new , prospective translational studies into sex-specific gene-environment interactions across the lifespan with the goal of improving preventative efforts and optimizing ( personalized) treatment in stress-related psychopathologies.
