  There is a need for studies to assess domestic violence ( DV) shelter workers views about brief HIV<pathogen> prevention interventions for shelter residents to improve these workers ' provision of HIV<pathogen> prevention interventions to shelter residents. This mixed methods study assessed DV shelter workers ' views about the following: ( a) the need for and appropriateness of HIV<pathogen> prevention services within DV shelters , ( b) the utility ( i.e. , acceptability , systems support , understanding , and feasibility) of an HIV<pathogen> Risk Assessment and Safety Plan ( HIV<pathogen> RASP) for women in DV shelters , and ( c) suggested changes to or concerns about using the HIV<pathogen> RASP. Workers from DV shelters located in the 10 states in the United States with the highest rates of HIV<pathogen> reviewed the HIV<pathogen> RASP and answered survey questions about it including the Usage Rating Profile-Intervention ( URP-I) Questionnaire and two open-ended questions. Although workers felt it was appropriate to provide HIV<pathogen> prevention interventions within DV shelters , only 23 % reported that HIV<pathogen> prevention interventions had ever been implemented at their shelter and only 42 % had provided residents with educational brochures about HIV<pathogen> prevention. Workers generally agreed that the HIV<pathogen> RASP was acceptable , understandable , and feasible. They somewhat disagreed about their ability to implement the tool independently. Findings suggest that little progress has been made in engaging DV shelter workers in HIV<pathogen> prevention efforts for residents during the past decade and reveal ways to improve the HIV<pathogen> RASP and overcome barriers to implementing it. The study findings may be used to help reduce gaps between the science and practice of HIV<pathogen> prevention for abused women.
