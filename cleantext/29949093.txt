  The intensity of care provided to critically ill patients has been shown to be associated with mortality. In patients with traumatic brain injury ( TBI) , specialized neurocritical care is often required , but whether it affects clinically significant outcomes is unknown. We aimed to determine the association of the intensity of care on mortality and the incidence of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies in critically ill patients with severe TBI. We conducted a post hoc analysis of a multicentre retrospective cohort study of critically ill adult patients with severe TBI. We defined the intensity of care as a daily cumulative sum of interventions during the intensive care unit stay. Our outcome measures were all-cause hospital mortality and the incidence of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies. Seven hundred sixteen severe TBI patients were included in our study. Most were male ( 77 %) with a mean ( standard deviation) age of 42 ( 20.5) yr and a median ( interquartile range) Glasgow Coma<symptom> Scale score of 3 ( 3-6). Our results showed an association between the intensity of care and mortality ( hazard ratio ( HR) , 0.69; 95 % confidence interval ( CI) , 0.63 to 0.74) and the incidence of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy ( HR , 0.73; 95 % CI , 0.67 to 0.79). In general , more intense care was associated with fewer deaths and a lower incidence of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies in critically ill patients with severe TBI.
