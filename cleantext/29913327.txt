  A general method to set illuminating conditions for selectable beam convergence and probe size is presented in this work for Transmission Electron Microscopes ( TEM) fitted with Âµs/pixel fast beam scanning control , ( S) TEM , and an annular dark field detector. The case of interest of beam convergence and probe size , which enables diffraction pattern indexation , is then used as a starting point in this work to add 100 Hz precession to the beam while imaging the specimen at a fast rate and keeping the projector system in diffraction mode. The described systematic alignment method for the adjustment of beam precession on the specimen plane while scanning at fast rates is mainly based on the sharpness of the precessed STEM image. The complete alignment method for parallel condition and precession , Quasi-Parallel PED-STEM , is presented in block diagram scheme , as it has been tested on a variety of instruments. The immediate application of this methodology is that it renders the TEM column ready for the acquisition of Precessed Electron Diffraction Tomographies ( EDT) as well as for the acquisition of slow Precessed Scanning Nanometer Electron Diffraction ( SNED). Examples of the quality of the Precessed Electron Diffraction ( PED) patterns and PED-STEM alignment images are presented with corresponding probe sizes and convergence angles.
