  To propose nursing diagnoses , outcomes and interventions for patients in the postoperative period of orthognathic surgery. Secondary analysis of an information bank of a focal group with five patients submitted to orthognathic surgery. The classifications of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association International , Nursing Outcomes Classification and Nursing Interventions Classification were used for elaborating nursing diagnoses , outcomes and interventions. Nursing diagnoses were identified based on the transcription of the focus group and the expected outcomes and interventions were proposed. In the second stage , the material was submitted to an analysis by judges for validating the previous stage. After careful analysis of the retrieved information , nine nursing diagnoses that relate to both the difficulties already installed and to potential patient difficulties were identified. After this phase , the expected outcomes for nursing care and the appropriate interventions for the postoperative period at home were identified. Given the short hospital stay and the long postoperative period , the established actions have a strong educational focus.
