  Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae present a real problem worldwide. We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics among Klebsiella<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> clinical isolates collected from a Hospital in the southeast of Tunisia. Eighteen cephalosporin-resistant K.<pathogen> pneumoniae<pathogen> were recovered between April 2015 and August 2016. Molecular characterization of antimicrobial resistance encoding genes was performed by PCR and sequencing. Results revealed several types of Ambler class A Î²-lactamase encoding genes among our isolates: ( bla
