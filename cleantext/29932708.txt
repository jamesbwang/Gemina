  We uncover signatures of quantum chaos in the many-body dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate-based quantum ratchet in a toroidal trap. We propose measures including entanglement , condensate depletion , and spreading over a fixed basis in many-body Hilbert space , which quantitatively identify the region in which quantum chaotic many-body dynamics occurs , where random matrix theory is limited or inaccessible. With these tools , we show that many-body quantum chaos is neither highly entangled nor delocalized in the Hilbert space , contrary to conventionally expected signatures of quantum chaos.
