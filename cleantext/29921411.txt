  Reactive oxygen species ( ROS) are major sources of cellular oxidative stress. Specifically , cancer cells harbor genetic alterations that promote a continuous and elevated production of ROS. While such oxidative stress conditions could be harmful to normal cells , they facilitate cancer cell growth in multiple ways by causing DNA damage and genomic instability , and ultimately , by reprogramming cancer cell metabolism. This review provides up to date findings regarding the role of ROS generation induced by diverse biological molecules and chemicals in representative women 's ' cancer. Specifically , we describe the cellular signaling pathways that regulate direct or indirect interactions between ROS homeostasis and metabolism within female genital cancer cells.
