  Background On-demand stimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion ( SPG) by means of an implantable neurostimulation system has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy for treatment-refractory cluster headache<symptom> patients. Our objective was to estimate changes in cluster headache<symptom> medication cost observed in SPG-treated chronic patients. Methods Detailed patient-level data of 71 chronic patients treated with the Pulsante Â® SPG Microstimulator System were available from the Pathway R-1 Registry through 12 months ' follow-up. We used utilization data of preventive and acute medications reported at baseline , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months to estimate annualized drug costs for SPG-treated patients and compared it to baseline. Cost estimates for all drug/dosage combinations were developed based on German medication prices for 2016. Results In the base case analysis , mean annual acute and preventive medication costs decreased from $ 14,178 to $ 6924 (- $ 7254; -51 %) , and $ 559 to $ 328 (- $ 231; -41 %) , respectively , leading to total estimated annual drug cost savings of $ 7484 , 97 % of which were attributable to acute medications. Conclusions Our analysis suggests that SPG stimulation for the treatment of chronic cluster headache<symptom> is associated with pronounced reductions in cluster headache<symptom> medication usage that might lead to sizable annual savings in medication costs.
