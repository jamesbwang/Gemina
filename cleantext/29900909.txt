  Interleukin-34 ( IL-34) is a recently identified alternative ligand for colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor plays an important role in osteoclastogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the IL-34 levels in gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF) and plasma in subjects with chronic periodontitis<disease> and to evaluate the effect of nonsurgical periodontal therapy on the GCF and plasma IL-34 levels. Thirty individuals ( age range: 30-56 years) were selected and divided into groups based on the gingival index , probing pocket depth , clinical attachment level , and radiologic parameters ( bone loss): Group I ( 15 individuals with healthy periodontium) , Group II ( 15 individuals with chronic generalized periodontitis<disease> while Group II patients after 8 weeks of the treatment ( scaling and root planning) constituted Group III. GCF samples and plasma samples were collected to estimate the levels of IL-34 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The mean IL-34 concentration in GCF and plasma was highest for Group II compared to Group I and decreased after nonsurgical periodontal therapy in chronic generalized periodontitis<disease> group. The difference between them was statistically significant ( P < 0.05). IL-34 can be considered as an `` inflammatory marker '' of periodontal<disease> disease<disease> and can be explored in the future as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of
