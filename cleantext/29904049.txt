  Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis flail arm ( ALS-FA) is a motor neuron disease form confined to the upper limbs ( cervical spinal cord region) , often with asymmetric onset. To date , there is no defined neurorehabilitative strategy for ALS patients , although aerobic exercises may be of some help. A 69 year-old woman affected by ALS-FA was admitted to our research institute because of upper limb<symptom> muscles<symptom> weakness<symptom>. She was then submitted to two different conventional physiotherapy programs , the first stand-alone and the second combined to a robotic treatment. The patient gained an important motor improvement only after 2-month treatment of physiotherapy plus Armeo-Power ( AP) , a robotic rehabilitation exoskeleton for upper limbs training , providing intelligent arm support in a 3D workspace. Even though this is a single case , our combined neurorehabilitation approach ( i.e. conventional physiotherapy plus robotics) could be considered a promising tool in improving upper limb function in patients affected by motoneurons disease , including ALS. Further studies involving a larger cohort of ALS-FA patients and long term follow- up are needed , in order to evaluate the efficacy of robotics in prolonging patient 's independence in active daily living.
