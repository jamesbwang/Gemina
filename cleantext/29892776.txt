  The aim of this study was to investigate the intergenerational changes of the selected body proportions of children and adolescents from Kolkata ( India). The analysis was based on anthropometric measurements of 7488 Bengali children ( 4222 boys and 3266 girls) , aged 7-19 , from the middle-class families. The cohorts from 1952-66 and 1999-2011 , as well as series of boys from 1982-83 , were compared in terms of body height , subischial leg length , biacromial width , biiliac width , reciprocal ponderal index ( RPI) , skelic index , pelvi-acromial index , shoulder-height ratio , pelvis-height ratio. The significance of the differences was determined by two-way ANOVA. All features , in both sexes , significantly differed between the 1952-66 and 1999-2011 cohorts. A general positive secular trend was observed for subischial leg length , biacromial width , and biiliac width and skelic index. Negative overall intergenerational changes were noted in the pelvi-acromial index , biacromial and biiliac width to body height ratio and RPI. In boys , the 1982-83 and 1999-2011 cohorts differed significantly only in the RPI. Between the 1952-66 and 1982-83 series the differences in subischial leg length , biacromial width , biiliac width ( in older boys) and pelvi-acromial index ( some age groups) were significant. Observed diversification of body proportions most likely results from the improvement of developmental conditions related to the socio-economic progress of India. However , increasing stoutness , visible in the RPI values , especially associated with its fatness , raises the risk of many health problems and diseases , even at the young age.
