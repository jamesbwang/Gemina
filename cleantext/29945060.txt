  In this paper , a simple , rapid and high-throughput fluorescence polarization immunoassay ( FPIA) based on polyclonal antibodies ( PAb) is described for the determination of glycocholic acid ( GCA) in human urine. Three fluorescein-labeled GCA ( tracers) with different structures and spacer bridges were synthesized and purified by thin-layer chromatography ( TLC). The structure effect of tracers on the assay was investigated and the sensitivity of best tracer in the optimized FPIA demonstrated an IC
