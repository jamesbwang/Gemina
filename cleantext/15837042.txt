  To stage axillary lymph nodes in women with early-stage breast cancer , sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB) , rather than axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND) , has been employed. Moreover , different tracer methods have various advantages and disadvantages. In recent years , carbon nanoparticle suspensions ( CNSs) have been used as lymph node tracers during surgeries for thyroid cancer , gastric cancer , and colorectal cancer. The study retrospectively analyzed the feasibility and accuracy of CNS for sentinel lymph node ( SLN) mapping in patients with early breast cancer. This single-center , retrospective study included breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB from January 1 , 2016 , to December 31 , 2017 , in the Department of Breast Cancer , Guangdong General Hospital. All patients received standard SLNB surgery using a CNS tracer. A total of 332 cases were included in this study. The SLN identification rate was 99.1 % ( 329/332) , and the mean number of SLNs was 2.6 ( range , 1-6). SLN metastasis was found in 62 ( 18.8 %) cases , of which 90.3 % were found to be macrometastases. The sensitivity of SLNB was 95.9 % ( 47/49) , with a specificity of 100 % ( 42/42) , a positive predictive value of 100 % ( 47/47) , a negative predictive value of 95.5 % ( 42/44) , and a false-negative rate of 4.1 % ( 2/49). The identification and predictive values of a CNS tracer for SLNB were satisfactory.
