  The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the fourth-generation quaternary ammonium compounds , didecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide ( DDAB) , on the efficacy of bacterial and viral decontamination against pathogens commonly found in livestock industry including The DDAB was prepared at 500 , 250 , and 125 parts per million ( ppm) for absent and present organic material. Meanwhile , 5 % of fetal bovine serum in DDAB solution sample was used to mimic the presence of organic material contamination. 400 µl of each DDAB concentration was mixed with 100 µl of each pathogen ( SI , Our current study revealed that the DDAB inactivated SI , The DDAB may be a potential disinfectant for inactivating bacteria and viruses , especially enveloped viruses , in livestock farms. It can be useful as a disinfectant for biosecurity enhancement on and around animal farm.
