  We assessed trace elements concentration in European pond turtle ( Emys orbicularis) from Brenne Natural Park ( France). We sampled road-killed turtles ( N = 46) to measure the concentrations of 4 non-essential ( Ag , Cd , Hg , and Pb) and 10 essential ( As , Co , Cr , Cu , Fe , Mn , Ni , Se , V , and Zn) elements in muscle , skin , liver and claws. Body size or sex did not influence the concentrations of most elements; except for Hg ( liver , skin and claws) and Zn ( muscle) which increased with body size. We found relatively high concentrations of Hg and Zn , possibly linked to fish farming. This result deserves future investigations to evaluate possible ecotoxicological effects on E. orbicularis.
