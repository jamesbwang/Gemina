  The synthesis of 1,2,4,5- and 1,2,9,10-tetrasubstituted and 1,2,4,5,8-pentasubsutituted pyrenes has been achieved by initially functionalizing the K-region of pyrene. Bromination , acylation , and formylation reactions afford high to moderate levels of regioselectivity , which facilitate the controlled introduction of other functional groups about 4,5-dimethoxypyrene. Access to 4,5-dimethoxypyren-1-ol and 9,10-dimethoxypyren-1-ol enabled a rare , C-2 primary alkyl substitution of pyrene.
