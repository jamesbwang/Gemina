  Sulfate-reducing bacteria ( SRB) and a biochar array were used to reduce sulfate concentrations and the levels of metals in acid mine drainage ( AMD) waters. Cow manure SRB-enriched biochar promoted sulfate reductions of 41 % compared to original AMD , and 39 % compared to other treatments ( control , AMD sediment , sludge). Treatments reduced levels of all analyzed metals below Brazilian official standards. DGGE showed a significant relation between SRB-source and SRB-structural community , where cow manure and sludge presented the more cohesive community structure throughout the monitoring ( 180 days). The study showed that AMD treatment alternatives can be applied and are effective in reducing the contamination of wastewaters.
