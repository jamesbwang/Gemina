  Based on research in physical anthropology , we argue that brightness marks the abstract category of gender , with light colours marking the female gender and dark colours marking the male gender. In a set of three experiments , we examine this hypothesis , first in a speeded gender classification experiment with male and female names presented in black and white. As expected , male names in black and female names in white are classified faster than the reverse gender-colour combinations. The second experiment relies on a gender classification task involving the disambiguation of very briefly appearing non-descript stimuli in the form of black and white ` blobs '. The former are classified predominantly as male and the latter as female names. Finally , the processes driving light and dark object choices for males and females are examined by tracking the number of fixations and their duration in an eye-tracking experiment. The results reveal that when choosing for a male target , participants look longer and make more fixations on dark objects , and the same for light objects when choosing for a female target. The implications of these findings , which repeatedly reveal the same data patterns across experiments with Dutch , Portuguese and Turkish samples for the abstract category of gender , are discussed. The discussion attempts to enlarge the subject beyond mainstream models of embodied grounding.This article is part of the theme issue ` Varieties of abstract concepts: development , use and representation in the brain '.
