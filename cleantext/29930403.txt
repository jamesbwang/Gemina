  To explore the DNA methylation sites correlated with blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> ( systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , mean arterial pressure , pulse pressure) in adult twin population. A total of 476 twins from the Chinese National Twin Registry were selected as the research population. Questionnaires were used to collect demographic characteristics , lifestyle , disease status and other information , and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , height , weight and other anthropometric indicators were measured. The genome-wide DNA methylation of whole blood samples was detected by using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. The DNA methylation sites correlated with blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> were analyzed by constructing mixed effect model with adjusting potential confounding factors , and the significant level was false discovery rate < 0.05. After data quality control , 465 twins ( 122 pairs of monozygotic twins , 104 pairs of dizygotic twins , 13 individuals from 13 pairs of twins) aged ( 44.8 Â± 13.2) years were finally enrolled. There were more males and more monozygotic twins , and the current smokers and current regular drinkers both accounted for more than 30 %. No significant CpG site was found after multiple testing in the correlation study between genome-wide DNA methylation and blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> by using the collected twins. However , the cg07761116 located on chromosome 10 had low P value in the correlation analysis of 3 blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> indices ( systolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , diastolic blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , mean arterial pressure) , suggesting that this site might be correlated with blood<symptom> pressure<symptom>. The other 7 sites had low P value in the correlation analysis of the two blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> indices , respectively , which pointed to genes involved in neurological development , protein homeostasis , inflammatory reaction and other pathways. There is no sufficient evidence to support any DNA methylation site correlated with blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> , which may be caused by insufficient sample size and other reasons. This study could provide a reference for subsequent similar twin studies , and subsequent studies can focus on the cg07761116 located on chromosome 10 and other sites with low P values.
