  The aims of this study were to determine the viability of using freeze-thaw infusion ( FI) technology to produce a range of root vegetables using enzyme treatments with improved texture characteristics for elderly consumers with swallowing difficulties. We applied enzyme impregnation as a technology to soften the textures of root vegetables commonly consumed in Korea; balloon flower root ( Platycodon grandiflorus) , burdock root ( Arctium lappa L.) , carrot ( Daucus carota L.) , and lotus root ( Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn) through the use of a texture analyzer after the FI of a commercial enzyme. Out of 15 commercial enzymes that were analyzed , three enzymes exhibited a marked softening effect on the tested carrots , burdock roots , balloon flower roots , and lotus roots. The hardness of the enzymes-treated food materials reached 1.4 Ã— 10
