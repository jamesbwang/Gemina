  Organisms have long been treated as receptors in exposure studies of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs) and other persistent organic pollutants ( POPs). The influences of environmental pollution on organisms are well recognized. However , the impact of biota on PCB transport in an environmental system has not been considered in sufficient detail. In this study , a population-based multi-compartment fugacity model is developed by reconfiguring the organisms as populated compartments and reconstructing all the exchange processes between the organism compartments and environmental compartments , especially the previously ignored feedback routes from biota to the environment. We evaluate the model performance by simulating the PCB concentration distribution in Lake Ontario using published loading records. The lake system is divided into three environment compartments ( air , water , and sediment) and several organism groups according to the dominant local biotic species. The comparison indicates that the simulated results are well-matched by a list of published field measurements from different years. We identify a new process , called Facilitated Biotic Intermedia Transport ( FBIT) , to describe the enhanced pollution transport that occurs between environmental media and organisms. As the hydrophobicity of PCB congener increases , the organism population exerts greater influence on PCB mass flows. In a high biomass scenario , the model simulation indicates significant FBIT effects and biotic storage effects with hydrophobic PCB congeners , which also lead to significant shifts in systemic contaminant exchange rates between organisms and the environment.
