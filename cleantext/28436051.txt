  Nitric oxide ( NO) is a small molecule involved in the regulation of many physiological processes. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of nervous system , immune and inflammatory responses , and blood flow. NO is synthesized by nitric oxide synthase ( NOS) during two-step oxidation of l-arginine to l-citrulline. Intermediates and derivatives of NO metabolism , such as l-arginine , l-citrulline , asymmetrical dimethylarginine ( ADMA) , symmetrical dimethylarginine ( SDMA) , and dimethylamine ( DMA) , are investigated as potential biomarkers. In this article , we present a novel analytical method that allowed for simultaneous analysis of l-arginine , ADMA , SDMA , l-citrulline , and DMA , in a single-step extraction and derivatization using benzoyl chloride. In brief , aliquots of serum were mixed with internal standard solution mixture ( 50 µM D6-DMA , 20 µM D7-ADMA , and 100 µM D7-arginine) and 0.025 M borate buffer , pH 9.2 ( 10:1:5). The derivatization process was performed at 25 °C for 5 min using 10 % benzoyl chloride. A reverse phase column was used for chromatographic separation. Quantitation was performed using following ions ( None
