  Friedreich ataxia<symptom> ( FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the FXN gene. FRDA is characterized by the classical triad of ataxia<symptom> , absent reflexes , and Babinski sign , but atypical presentations might also occur. Our aims were to describe the proportion of FRDA diagnoses in suspected families living in Rio Grande do Sul , South Brazil , and to estimate a minimum frequency of symptomatic subjects. Subjects that were evaluated by molecular analysis for FRDA at the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre were identified in our files. Patients ' clinical manifestation and phenotypes were described and compared. The number of FRDA subjects alive in the last 5 years was determined. One hundred fifty-six index cases ( families) were submitted to evaluation of GAA repeats at FXN since 1997: 27 were confirmed as FRDA patients. Therefore , the diagnostic yield was 17.3 %. Proportion of classical , late onset , and retained reflexes subphenotypes were similar to those described by other studies. A minimum prevalence was estimated as 0.20:100.000 inhabitants. In conclusion , we verified that this FRDA population displayed the usual clinical characteristics , but with a lower period prevalence than those obtained in populations from Europe.
