  The aim of our study was to investigate which technique among hybrid external fixation , plate and screws , and intramedullary nailing produces better outcomes in foot loading when treating type 43. A1 , 43. A2 , and 43. A3 fractures , according to the AO classification. From November 2011 to December 2014 , 34 patients , including 25 ( 73.5 %) males and 9 ( 26.5 %) females with an average age of 32.3 ( range 16 to 67) years , with a type A tibia fracture were treated with intramedullary nailing , plate and screws , or hybrid external fixation. The patients were divided into 3 groups: 16 ( 47 %) received hybrid external fixation , 10 ( 29.4 %) received plate and screw fixation , and 8 ( 23.5 %) received intramedullary nailing fixation. The follow-up protocol included clinical and radiologic evaluations performed at 15 days , 1 month , 3 months , 6 months , and 12 months after surgery. The selected outcome parameters for the 3 groups were as follows: visual analog scale for pain of the traumatized tibia , interval from surgery to weightbearing , average time required for fracture recovery , subjective and objective Ovadia-Beals scores , baropodometric examination at 12 months , walking recovery at 12 months , outcomes , and surgical complications. The endpoint assessment was set at 12 months. The results showed that incorrect reduction of a type A tibia fracture can lead to changes in the sagittal balance<symptom> line for foot loading and pace training. In conclusion , these findings have shown that the experience of the surgeon in the reduction of the fracture and knowledge of the method of synthesis is essential.
