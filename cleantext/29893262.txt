  As the worldwide population ages , oncologists are often required to make difficult and complex decisions regarding the treatment of older people ( aged 65 years and older) with cancer. Chronological age alone is often a poor indicator of the physiological and functional status of older adults , and thus should not be the main factor guiding treatment decisions in oncology. By contrast , a geriatric assessment can provide a much more comprehensive understanding of the functional and physiological age of an older person with cancer. The geriatric assessment is a multidimensional tool that evaluates several domains , including physical function , cognition , nutrition , comorbidities , psychological status , and social support. In this Series paper , we discuss the use of a geriatric assessment-based approach to cancer care , and provide clinicians with tools to better assess the risks and benefits of treatment to engage in shared decision making and provide better personalised care for older people with cancer.
