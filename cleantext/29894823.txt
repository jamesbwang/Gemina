  Photodynamic therapy ( PDT) initiates with the absorption of light , which depends on the spectral overlap between the light source emission and the photosensitizer absorption , resulting in the number of photons absorbed , the key parameter starting PDT processes. Most papers report light doses regardless if the light is only partially absorbed or shifted relatively to the absorption peak , misleading the actual light dose value and not allowing quantitative comparisons between photosensitizers and light sources. In this manuscript a method is presented to calculate the actual light dose delivered by any light source for a given photosensitizer. This method allows comparing light doses delivered for any combination of light source ( broad or narrow band or daylight) and photosensitizer.
