These seven substances are: N- ( 1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)- N-phenylpentanamide ( valeryl fentanyl) , N- ( 4-fluorophenyl) N- ( 1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl) butyramide ( para-fluorobutyryl fentanyl) , N- ( 4-methoxyphenyl)- N- ( 1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl) butyramide ( para-methoxybutyryl fentanyl) , N- ( 4-chlorophenyl)- N- ( 1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl) isobutyramide ( para-chloroisobutyryl fentanyl) , N- ( 1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)- N-phenylisobutyramide ( isobutyryl fentanyl) , N- ( 1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)- N-phenylcyclopentanecarboxamide ( cyclopentyl fentanyl) , and N- ( 2- fluorophenyl) -2-methoxy-N- ( 1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl) acetamide ( ocfentanil). This action is based on a finding by the Administrator that the placement of these seven synthetic opioids in schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.
