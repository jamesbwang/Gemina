  We discuss the rationale and description of the Internet-Based Interacting Together Everyday , Recovery After Childhood TBI ( I-InTERACT) , a telehealth intervention designed to promote positive parenting skills through live in-session skills practice and coaching. A second objective is to describe the protocol of a three-armed ( Internet Resource Comparison , I-InTERACT , and I-InTERACT Express) multi-site randomized controlled trial ( RCT) designed to examine intervention effectiveness. Participants included parents of children ages 3-9 who sustained a moderate or severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI) any time since birth. Measures assessing parenting behaviors , parent-child interaction , parent/family factors , and child factors were collected prior to intervention , 3 months after enrollment and 6-months after enrollment. This protocol manuscript was submitted before the completion of data collection and prior to any data analysis. It is expected that the I-InTERACT and I-InTERACT Express interventions will be associated with an increase in positive parenting behaviors , and a decrease in negative parenting behaviors , parental distress , and child behavior problems. Finally it is expected that socioeconomic status , life stressors , and social resources will moderate treatment effects. The study described in this protocol paper represents one of the first large multi-site RCTs of a parenting intervention designed to promote positive parenting skills in families with young children who sustained a TBI. We plan to disseminate findings to patients and families as well as clinical and research professionals , and begin to develop a research base for this telehealth intervention.
