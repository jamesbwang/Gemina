  Since its discovery , the flameless combustion ( FC) regime has been a promising alternative to reduce pollutant emissions of gas turbine engines. This combustion mode is characterized by well-distributed reaction zones , which potentially decreases temperature gradients , acoustic oscillations , and NO
