  A chromatographic method has been developed and validated for the first time for analysis of terizidone in plasma. Terizidone was extracted from plasma by protein precipitation using a mixture of acetonitrile and methanol ( 1:1 , v/v). The chromatographic separation was achieved with a gradient of acetonitrile and water both containing 0.1 % formic acid on a Supelco Discovery
