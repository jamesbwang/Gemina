  Immersive technologies like stereo rendering , virtual reality , or augmented reality ( AR) are often used in the field of molecular visualisation. Modern , comparably lightweight and affordable AR headsets like Microsoft 's HoloLens open up new possibilities for immersive analytics in molecular visualisation. A crucial factor for a comprehensive analysis of molecular data in AR is the rendering speed. HoloLens , however , has limited hardware capabilities due to requirements like battery life , fanless cooling and weight. Consequently , insights from best practises for powerful desktop hardware may not be transferable. Therefore , we evaluate the capabilities of the HoloLens hardware for modern , GPU-enabled , high-quality rendering methods for the space-filling model commonly used in molecular visualisation. We also assess the scalability for large molecular data sets. Based on the results , we discuss ideas and possibilities for immersive molecular analytics. Besides more obvious benefits like the stereoscopic rendering offered by the device , this specifically includes natural user interfaces that use physical navigation instead of the traditional virtual one. Furthermore , we consider different scenarios for such an immersive system , ranging from educational use to collaborative scenarios.
