  Due to the rapid changes in the medical world and the aging population , the need for advanced care planning grows. Despite efforts to make this topic discussed , only a minority of patients discusses the advance directive with their general practitioner ( GP). This study aimed to map thresholds: What barriers are identified by GPs and patients in preparing and discussing an advance directive? A cross section survey in patients and GP 's was performed. Citizens were recruited by multimedia and by street interviews. GP 's were recruited by mailing. Most of the 502 citizens already heard of an advance directive but only 17 had declared one while 21 never want one. Eighty percent wants to take the initiative themselves but half of the participants wants the GP to be actively involved. Thirty percent finds the document too difficult to understand. The need to draw an advance directive grew with increasing age. Of the 117 GP 's involved , 65 % drafted five or less advance directives the past year. A lack of time , experience and a poor access to the correct administrative requirements were only a few of the barriers. Preparing and drafting an advance directive is a time-consuming and difficult procedure. Patients and GP 's have the right to be informed and instructed on how to prepare an advance directive.
