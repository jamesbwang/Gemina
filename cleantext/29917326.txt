  Up to 50 % of uveal melanomas ( UM) metastasize to the liver within 10 years of diagnosis , and these almost always prove rapidly fatal. Since histopathological growth patterns ( HGP) of liver metastases of the replacement and desmoplastic type , particularly from colon and breast carcinoma , may import valuable biological and prognostic information , we have studied HGP in a series of 41 UM liver metastases originating from 41 patients from the period 2006-2017. Twenty patients underwent enucleation while 21 had radiation therapy. Analysis of UM by array comparative genomic hybridization revealed: 25 ( 64 %) patients with high risk ( monosomy3/8q gain); 13 ( 33 %) intermediate risk ( M3/8normal or disomy3/8q gain); and 1 low risk ( disomy3/8normal). The principal HGP was replacement in 30 ( 73 %) cases and desmoplastic in 11 ( 27 %) cases. Cases with replacement demonstrated striking vascular co-option/angiotropism. With the development of liver metastasis , only the replacement pattern , largest primary tumor diameter , and R2 ( incomplete resection) status predicted diminished overall survival ( p < 0.041 , p < 0.017 , p < 0.047 respectively). On multivariate analysis , only HGP ( HR = 6.51 , p = 0.008) and resection status remained significant. The genomic high-risk variable had no prognostic value at this stage of liver metastasis. Chi-square test showed no association of HGP with monosomy 3 or 8q gain. Eighteen of 41 ( 44 %) patients are alive with disease and 23 ( 56 %) patients died with follow-up ranging from 12 to 318 months ( mean: 70 months , median: 47 months). In conclusion , we report for the first time the frequency of the replacement and desmoplastic HPG in liver UM metastases resected from living patients , and their potential important prognostic value for UM patients , as in other solid cancers. These results may potentially be utilized to develop radiologic correlates and therapeutic targets for following and treating patients with UM metastases. This article is protected by copyright.
