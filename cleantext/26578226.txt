  This study utilizes qualitative and quantitative methods to measure the adoption of speech recognition ( SR) and its impact ON provider satisfaction , documentation quality , efficiency , and cost when used for clinical documentation within the electronic health record ( EHR). Qualitative surveys gauged providers ' expectations and experiences regarding documentation before and after SR implementation. A new methodology was developed to measure SR adoption as a proportion of total documentation volume. Quantitative data was collected from the EHR , medical transcription and SR solutions to measure SR adoption and cost savings. Study results revealed significant improvements in satisfaction , documentation quality , and efficiency among providers as a direct result of SR use. An improved provider experience correlated to an 81 % reduction in monthly medical transcription costs , an increase from 20 % to 77 % in electronic clinical documentation adoption , and a 74 % SR adoption rate.
