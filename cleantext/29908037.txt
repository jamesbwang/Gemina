  To assess the effects of alpha-blockers compared to standard therapy or placebo for ureteral stones 1 cm and less confirmed by imaging in adult patients presenting with symptoms of ureteral stone disease. We performed a systematic search in multiple databases and grey literature with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status , up until November 2017. We included randomised controlled trials evaluating ureteral stone passage in adult patients , that compared alpha-blockers with standard therapy or placebo. Two review authors were independently responsible for study selection , data extraction , and risk of bias assessment. We performed a meta-analysis using a random effect model. The quality of evidence was assess on outcome basis according to GRADE. We included 67 studies , with 10,509 participants overall. Of these , 15 studies with 5787 participants used a placebo. Stone clearance: treatment with an alpha-blocker may result in a large increase in stone clearance ( RR 1.45 , 95 % CI 1.36 to 1.55; low quality evidence). corresponding to 278 more ( 95 % CI: 223 more to 340 more) stone clearances per 1000 participants. Major adverse events: treatment with an alpha-blocker may have little effect on major adverse events ( RR 1.25 , 95 % CI 0.80 to 1.96; low quality evidence); this corresponds to 5 more ( CI 4 fewer to 19 more) major adverse events per 1000 participants. Patients treated with alpha-blockers may also experience shorter stone expulsion times ( MD -3.40 days , 95 % CI: -4.17 to -2.63; low quality evidence) , use less diclofenac ( MD -82.41 , 95 % CI -122.51 to -42.31; low quality evidence) and likely require fewer hospitalizations ( RR 0.51 , 95 % CI 0.34 to 0.77; moderate quality evidence). Meanwhile , the need for surgical intervention appears similar ( RR 0.74 , 95 % CI 0.53 to 1.02; low quality evidence). Based on a predefined subgroup analysis ( test for subgroup difference , p = 0.002) , there may be a different effect of alpha-blockers based on stone size with RRs of 1.06 ( 95 % CI 0.98 to 1.15; P = 0.16; I ² = 62 %) for stones 5 mm or less versus 1.45 ( 95 % CI 1.22 to 1.72; P < 0.0001; I ² = 59 %) for stones greater than 5 mm. We did not find evidence for possible subgroup effects based on stone location or alpha-blocker type. In patients with ureteral stones , alpha-blockers likely increase stone clearance but probably also slightly increase the risk of major adverse events. Subgroup analyses suggest that alpha-blockers may be less effective in smaller ( 5 mm or less) than larger stones ( greater than 5 mm) This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
