  Nowadays , interest in using environmentally friendly materials is increasing in many fields. However , the rational design of sensors with biodegradable materials is a challenge. The main aim of this work is to show the possibility of using zein , a protein from corn , as a biodegradable and low-cost material for immobilizing , stabilizing , and delivering different kind of reagents for developing optical sensors. Enzymes , metallic salts , and aromatic and small organic compounds were tested. In addition , different techniques of immobilization , entrapment and adsorption , were used , and different formats , such as solid devices and also multiwell platforms , were proposed. The capacity of zein for immobilizing two reagents together , enzyme and substrate , into a multianalysis format was also shown. Two applications were developed as examples: a colorimetric assay based on a ferric hydroxamate reaction for ester drugs , which was applied in atropine determination in pills , and a fluorimetric enzymatic multiwell-plate biodevice applied in phosphate determination in human serum and urine. Zein demonstrated being not only a green alternative but also a versatile polymer for developing sensors from reagents with different natures in different formats and matrices , thereby resulting in different applications.
