  Survivorship care plans ( SCPs)- documents intended to improve care for cancer survivors who have completed active treatment-are required , yet implementation is poor. We sought to understand SCP implementation in cancer programs in the USA with the objective of identifying opportunities for improvement. We recruited cancer care providers in the USA via several cancer care networks to participate in a survey regarding SCP implementation. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the data. Three hundred ninety-five providers from diverse cancer programs in 47 states and Washington , DC responded to the survey. The timing of SCP implementation varied across and within cancer programs , with approximately 40 % of respondents reporting developing SCPs more than 3 months after primary treatment or adjuvant therapy completion. Nurse navigators were responsible for 48-58 % of each stage of SCP implementation. Processes that could have been automated often occurred in-person or via phone and vice versa. Respondents reported spending more than 2 h per SCP to complete all stages of implementation , of which less than a third was reimbursed by third-party payers. We identified several opportunities for improving SCP implementation , including broadening the base of responsibility , optimizing modes of communication , decreasing the time required and increasing the funding available , and limiting variation in SCP implementation across and within cancer programs. Future work should assess the influence of approaches to SCP implementation on desired outcomes.
