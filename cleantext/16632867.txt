  The cure rate for late stage epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC) has not significantly improved over several decades. New and more effective targets and treatment modalities are urgently needed. RNA-seq analyses of a syngeneic EOC cell pair , representing more and less aggressive tumor cells in vivo were conducted. Bioinformatics analyses of the RNA-seq data and biological signaling and function studies have identified new targets , such as ZIP4 in EOC. Many up-regulated tumor promoting signaling pathways have been identified which are mainly grouped into three cellular activities: 1) cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance; 2) cell skeleton and adhesion changes; and 3) carbohydrate metabolic reprograming. Unexpectedly , lipid metabolism has been the major down-regulated signaling pathway in the more aggressive EOC cells. In addition , we found that hypoxic responsive genes were at the center stage of regulation and detected functional changes were related to cancer stem cell-like activities. Moreover , our genetic , cellular , biochemical , and lipidomic analyses indicated that cells grown in 2D vs. 3D , or attached vs. suspended had dramatic changes. The important clinical implications of peritoneal cavity floating tumor cells are supported by the data proved in this work. Overall , the RNA-seq data provide a landscape of gene expression alterations during tumor progression.
