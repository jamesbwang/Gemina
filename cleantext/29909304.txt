  Depressed patients are at increased risk to fall victim to a violent crime compared to the general population. It remains unknown whether their increased risk persists after remission. This study compared victimization rates of remitted patients with both a random general population sample and a group of currently depressed patients. Furthermore , this study aimed to identify predictors of future violent victimization. In this longitudinal study conducted in the Netherlands , 12-month prevalence rates of sexual assaults , physical assaults , and threats were assessed with the Safety Monitor in 140 currently remitted patients with recurrent depression<symptom> , and compared to those of a weighted general population sample ( N = 9.175) and a weighted sample of currently depressed outpatients ( N = 102) using Chi-square tests. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify baseline predictors of future victimization. The prevalence of violent victimization did not differ between remitted patients and the general population ( 12.1 vs. 11.7 %). Remitted patients were significantly less likely to have been victimized over the past 12 months than currently depressed patients ( 12.1 vs. 35.5 %). In remitted patients , living alone and low sense of mastery at baseline predicted future violent victimization. However , when combined in a multiple model , only living alone was independently associated with violent victimization ( Ï‡ Our comparison of victimization rates across samples was cross-sectional. Since the increased risk of victimization appears to be specific for the acute depressive state , preventive interventions should target victimization in currently depressed patients.
