  Virus-like particle ( VLP) technologies are based on virus-inspired artificial structures and the intrinsic ability of viral proteins to self-assemble at controlled conditions. Therefore , the basic knowledge about the mechanisms of viral particle formation is highly important for designing of industrial applications. As an alternative to genetic and chemical processes , different physical methods are frequently used for VLP construction , including well characterized protein complexes for introduction of foreign molecules in VLP structures.This chapter shortly discusses the mechanisms how the viruses form their perfectly ordered structures as well as the principles and most interesting application examples , how to exploit the structural and assembly/disassembly properties of viral structures for creation of new nanomaterials.
