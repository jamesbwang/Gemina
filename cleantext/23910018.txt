  Many blood conservation techniques and strategies have been implemented to aid in decreasing the use of allogenic blood utilization during pediatric cardiothoracic surgery. Use of techniques , such as acute normovolemic hemodilution , retrograde autologous prime , venous autologous prime , and autotransfuion , may lead to a decrease in the need for allogenic blood products. Autotransfusion has become a standard of care for all cardiothoracic surgical procedures requiring cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB). Although widely used , there is still debate over which wash solution will produce the most physiologically normal autotransfusion product. Pediatric patients can be at a higher risk for electrolyte imbalance intraoperatively and postoperatively. In an attempt to minimize this , we sought out to evaluate three different wash solutions and how they would affect the final autotransfusion product. This comparison consisted of three wash solutions; .9 % sodium chloride , Normosol-R
