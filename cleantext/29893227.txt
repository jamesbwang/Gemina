  Psoriatic arthritis<disease> , or the broader term psoriatic disease , refers to an inflammatory disorder that affects multiple organs , including the skin and joints , and that also has related extra-articular manifestations and can have comorbidities. Patients with psoriatic disease have a substantial clinical burden. Early identification leading to timely diagnosis and treatment is crucial to prevent long-term structural damage and disability and the associated socioeconomic consequences. The increase in therapeutic options , such as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs , both biological and targeted synthetic , has revolutionised the treatment of skin and joint disease , and has prompted clinicians to use the full clinical picture of an individual patient to make rational treatment decisions. Current research is also focused on treatment strategies , including treat to target , early remission-induction , and tapering.
