  A large body of research links testosterone and cortisol to male-male competition. Yet , little work has explored acute steroid hormone responses to coalitional , physical competition during middle childhood. Here , we investigate testosterone , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA) , androstenedione , and cortisol release among ethnically Chinese boys in Hong Kong ( N = 102) , aged 8-11 years , during a soccer match ( n = 84) and an intrasquad soccer scrimmage ( n = 81) , with 63 participants competing in both treatments. The soccer match and intrasquad soccer scrimmage represented out-group and in-group treatments , respectively. Results revealed that testosterone showed no measurable change. DHEA increased during both treatments in the majority of participants and the degree of change had no relation to independent variables ( e.g. , performance , age , treatment , outcome) or covariate measures ( Body Mass Index , Pubertal Development Scale). Most boys experienced androstenedione increases during match play , but no significant differences during the intrasquad soccer scrimmage competitions. The magnitude of change differed significantly between treatments and was positively associated with age. These latter findings suggest boys ' androstenedione responses may be sensitive to competitor type ( i.e. , unknown competitors vs. peers). For most subjects , cortisol significantly increased during match play , decreased during the intrasquad soccer scrimmage , and differed significantly between treatments , suggesting each treatment promoted a different psychological state among competitors. Cortisol/DHEA molar ratio decreased during the intrasquad scrimmage , suggestive of a more relaxed mental state. These data shed new light on potential proximate mechanisms associated with coalitional competition among prepubescent boys , with relevance to adrenarche and life history theory.
