  The intra-aortic balloon pump ( IABP) is frequently used to support severely compromised ventricles in critically ill patients. Its relatively affordability and ease of insertion has cemented its position as the first line of treatment for hemodynamic support in cardiogenic shock<symptom>. Accordingly , the current ACC/AHA recommendations maintain a Class 2A for the use of IABP in shock<symptom>. However , a review of the current literature suggests that the evidence supporting the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association ( ACC/AHA) guidelines are equivocal. Alternative uses for IABP such as perioperative support during high-risk cardiac surgery , treatment of left ventricular distention<symptom> on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation , and as bridge to transplant have been proposed. The effectiveness of the IABP in these clinical situations remains largely unproven , due to the paucity of available data.
