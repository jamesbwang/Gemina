  Environmental mercury ( Hg) pollution is a matter of global concern. Mercury speciation controls its environmental behaviour , and stable isotope ratios can potentially trace Hg movement through environmental compartments. Here we investigated Hg in industrially contaminated soils and sediments ( Visp , Valais , Switzerland) using concentration and stable isotope analysis ( CV-MC-ICP-MS) of total digests , and a four-step sequential extraction procedure. The sequential extraction employed ( 1) water ( labile Hg species) , ( 2) NaOH or Na
