  Soil microbes that colonize plant roots and are responsive to differences in plant genotype remain to be ascertained for agronomically important crops. From a very large-scale longitudinal field study of 27 maize inbred lines planted in three fields , with partial replication 5 y later , we identify root-associated microbiota exhibiting reproducible associations with plant genotype. Analysis of 4,866 samples identified 143 operational taxonomic units ( OTUs) whose variation in relative abundances across the samples was significantly regulated by plant genotype , and included five of seven core OTUs present in all samples. Plant genetic effects were significant amid the large effects of plant age on the rhizosphere microbiome , regardless of the specific community of each field , and despite microbiome responses to climate events. Seasonal patterns showed that the plant root microbiome is locally seeded , changes with plant growth , and responds to weather events. However , against this background of variation , specific taxa responded to differences in host genotype. If shown to have beneficial functions , microbes may be considered candidate traits for selective breeding.
