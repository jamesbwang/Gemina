  Bottom-up fabrication via on-surface molecular self-assembly is a way to create defect-free , low-dimensional nanomaterials. For bottom-up fabrication to succeed , precursor molecules which correctly assemble into the target structure must be first identified. Here we present an informatics technique which connects self-assembled structures with particular chemical properties of the precursor molecules. Application of this method produces a visual output ( a dendrogram) that functions much like the periodic table , but whereas the periodic table puts atoms into categories according to the way in which they bond to each other , the dendrogram put molecules into categories according to the way in which they arrange in a self-assembled structure. By applying this method to the case of functionalized bianthracene precursors adsorbed to copper ( 111) , we identify the functional groups needed to assemble one-dimensional chains , two-dimensional tilings , and other shapes. This methodology can therefore help to identify appropriate precursor molecules for forming target nanomaterials via bottom-up fabrication.
