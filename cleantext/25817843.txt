  Cerebral palsy ( CP) is the leading cause of motor disability in children; however , its pathogenesis is unknown in most cases. Growing evidence suggests that Nitric oxide synthase 1 ( NOS1) is involved in neural development and neurologic diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic variants of NOS1 contribute to CP susceptibility in a Han Chinese population. A case-control study involving 652 CP patients and 636 healthy controls was conducted. Six SNPs in the NOS1 gene ( rs3782219 , rs6490121 , rs2293054 , rs10774909 , rs3741475 , and rs2682826) were selected , and the MassARRAY typing technique was applied for genotyping. Data analysis was conducted using SHEsis online software , and multiple test corrections were performed using SNPSpD online software. There were no significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between patients and controls for the SNPs except rs6490121 , which deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and was excluded from further analyses. Subgroup analysis revealed differences in genotype frequencies between the CP with neonatal encephalopathy group ( CP + NE) and control group for rs10774909 , rs3741475 , and rs2682826 ( after SNPSpD correction , p = 0.004 , 0.012 , and 0.002 , respectively). The T allele of NOS1 SNP rs3782219 was negatively associated with spastic quadriplegia ( OR = 0.742 , 95 % CI = 0.600-0.918 , after SNPSpD correction , p = 0.023). There were no differences in allele or genotype frequencies between CP subgroups and controls for the other genetic polymorphisms. NOS1 is associated with CP + NE and spastic quadriplegia , suggesting that NOS1 is likely involved in the pathogenesis of CP and that it is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of cerebral injury.
