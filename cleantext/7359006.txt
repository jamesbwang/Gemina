  Hypericin , a powerful natural photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy ( PDT) , is suitable for treating skin diseases involving excess capillary proliferation. In the present study , we aimed to evaluate the skin penetrability of topically applied hypericin , expecting a reduced risk of prolonged skin photosensitivity , which often occurs after systemic administration. Firstly , the Franz diffusion cell assays were performed to evaluate the penetration effects of different enhancers , including menthol , propylene glycol , camphanone , azone , and carbamide. In view of above evaluation results , we selected menthol as the enhancer in the subsequent in vivo studies. The setting groups were as follows: the blank control group , the light-exposure control group , the gel-base control group , the hypericin gel group , and a hypericin gel-containing menthol group. Except for the blank control , all other animals were irradiated by a LED light. Then , fluorescence microscopy was performed to examine the distribution of hypericin in the skin of nude mouse. Macroscopic and microscopic analyses were also carried out to detect pathological changes in the skin after topical hypericin-PDT treatment. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression change of PECAM-1. As shown in the results , menthol facilitated hypericin penetrate the skin of nude mice most. The results of in vivo assays revealed that hypericin penetrated nude mouse skin , spread to the dermis , and resulted in obvious photosensitivity reaction on the dermal capillaries. Moreover , skin injured by the photosensitive reaction induced by hypericin-PDT treatment was replaced by normal skin within 7 days. We concluded that topical applied hypericin could penetrate nude mouse skin well and has a great potential in PDT treatment of skin diseases.
