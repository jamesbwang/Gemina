  Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are natural molecules playing important roles in different biochemical processes in nature and in humans. In this work , the electron ionization mass spectrum ( EI-MS) of retronecine , an alkaloid molecule found in plants , is investigated computationally. Its mass spectrum can be characterized by three main fragment ions having the following m/z ratios: 111 , 94 and 80. In order to rationalize the mass spectrum , minima and transition state geometries were computed using density functional theory ( DFT). It was showed that the dissociation process includes an aromatization of the originally five-membered ring of retronecine converted into a six-membered ring compound. A fragmentation pathway mechanism involving dissociation activation barriers that are easily overcome by the initial ionization energy was found. From the computed quantum chemical geometric , atomic charges and energetic parameters , the abundance of each ion in the mass spectrum of retronecine was discussed.
