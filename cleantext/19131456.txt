  Nonsmoking youth form a high-risk group and are at increased risk of ill-effects caused due to secondhand smoke ( SHS). The objective is to determine the prevalence and correlates of SHS exposure among the nonsmoking youth in India from global adult tobacco survey ( GATS) , 2009-10. Secondary data analysis of GATS , 2009-10 was done to find the correlates of SHS at three different settings- house , workplace- indoor , and public place. All the sociodemographic variables were tested for association with SHS exposure using multivariate analysis. Prevalence ratio with 95 % confidence interval ( CI) was used to report the risk. The prevalence of SHS was 48.6 % ( 95 % CI: 47.7 % -49.5 %) at house , 25.5 % ( 95 % CI: 23.5 % -27.6 %) at workplace- indoors , and 42.7 % ( 95 % CI: 41.7 % -43.7 %) at public places. SHS exposure among females was found to be higher at house; youth living in rural area were found at increased risk to SHS at both household and public places; and inverse relationship was seen between SHS exposure and education level at both household and workplace- indoors. Overall , the study showed that smokeless tobacco users were at increased risk of SHS exposure at all the three settings. Being female , living in rural area , lower education status , lower socioeconomic status , and use of smokeless tobacco were found to be associated with SHS exposure among nonsmoking youth in India.
