  Kawasaki disease ( KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis that primarily affects the coronary artery , but does not commonly affect the carotid artery. Cerebral infarction ( CI) with internal carotid artery stenosis ( ICS) in patients with KD had never been reported. We report a patient with CI as a remote phase complication of KD. A 32-year-old man presented with impaired consciousness<symptom>. Magnetic resonance imaging scan ( MRI) and digital subtraction angiogram ( DSA) confirmed CI and ICS. He successfully underwent carotid endarterectomy ( CEA). The resected plaque had pathological findings of KD , which suggested that the internal carotid artery suffered from chronic inflammation<symptom>. KD in childhood may cause symptomatic ICS as sequalae of a remote phase.
