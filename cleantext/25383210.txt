  Despite recent clinical guidelines , the optimal therapeutic strategy for the management of refractory chronic<symptom> cough<symptom> is still a challenge. The present systematic review was designed to assess the evidence for efficacy and safety of gabapentin in the treatment of chronic<symptom> cough<symptom>. A systematic search of PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Library databases , and publications cited in bibliographies was performed. Articles were searched by two reviewers with a priori criteria for study selection. Seven relevant articles were identified , including two randomized controlled trials , one prospective case-series designed with consecutive patients , one retrospective case series of consecutive patients , one retrospective case series with unknown consecutive status , and two case reports comprising six and two patients , respectively. Improvements were detected in cough-specific quality of life ( Leicester Cough<symptom> Questionnaire score) and cough<symptom> severity ( visual analogue scale score) following gabapentin treatment in randomized controlled trials. The results of prospective case-series showed that the rate of overall improvement of cough<symptom> and sensory neuropathy with gabapentin was 68 %. Gabapentin treatment of patients with chronic<symptom> cough<symptom> showed superior efficacy and a good safety record compared with placebo or standard medications. Additional randomized and controlled trials are needed.
