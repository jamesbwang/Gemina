  Our aims were to develop a training system for camera assistants ( CA) , and evaluate participants ' performance as CA. A questionnaire on essential requirements to be a good CA was administered to experts in pediatric endoscopic surgery. An infant-sized box trainer with several markers and lines inside was developed. Participants performed marker capturing and line-tracing tasks using a 5-mm 30 Â° scope. A postexperimental questionnaire on the developed system was administered. The task completion time was measured. The 5-point evaluation scale was used for each item in the questionnaire survey of experts. The abilities to maintain a horizontal line ( mean score: 4.5) and to center the target in a specified rectangle on the monitor ( 4.5) as well as having a full understanding of the operative procedure ( 4.3) were ranked as highly important. Fifty-two participants , including 5 surgical residents , were enrolled in the evaluation experiment. The completion time of capturing the markers was significantly longer in the resident group than in the nonresident group ( 244 versus 124 seconds , P = .04) , but that of tracing the lines was not significantly different between the groups. The postexperimental questionnaire showed that the participants felt that the line-tracing tasks ( 3.7) were more difficult than marker-capturing tasks ( 2.9). Being proficient in manipulating a camera and having adequate knowledge of operative procedures are essential requirements to be a good CA. The ability was different between the resident and nonresident groups even in a simple task such as marker capturing.
