  Infections by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ( CRE) are difficult to manage owing to broad antibiotic resistance profiles and because of the inability of clinically-used β-lactamase inhibitors to counter the activity of metallo-β-lactamases often harbored by these pathogens. Of particular importance is New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase ( NDM) , which requires a dinuclear zinc ion cluster for catalytic activity. Here , we compare the structures and functions of clinical NDM variants 1-17. The impact of NDM variants on structure is probed by comparing comparing melting temperature and refolding efficiency and also by spectroscopy ( UV-Vis ,
