  Reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPS) or directly into cells from a different lineage , including neurons , has revolutionized research in regenerative medicine in recent years. Mesenchymal stem cells are good candidates for lineage reprogramming and autologous transplantation , since they can be easily isolated from accessible sources in adult humans , such as bone<disease> marrow and dental tissues. Here , we demonstrate that expression of the transcription factors ( TFs) SRY ( sex determining region Y)- box 2 (
