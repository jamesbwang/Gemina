  Small molecule induced hepatitis<pathogen> B<pathogen> virus<pathogen> ( HBV<pathogen>) capsid assembly modulation is considered an attractive approach for new antiviral therapies against HBV. Here we describe efforts toward the discovery of a HBV<pathogen> capsid assembly modulator in a hit-to-lead optimization , resulting in JNJ-632 , a tool compound used to further profile the mode of action. Administration of JNJ-632 ( 54) in HBV<pathogen> genotype D infected chimeric mice resulted in a 2.77 log reduction of the HBV<pathogen> DNA viral load.
