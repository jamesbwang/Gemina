  Cell quantification assays are essential components of most biological and clinical labs. However , many currently available quantification assays , including flow cytometry and commercial cell counting systems , suffer from unique drawbacks that limit their overall efficacy. In order to address the shortcomings of traditional quantification assays , we have designed a robust , low-cost , automated microscopy-based cytometer that quantifies individual cells in a multiwell plate using tools readily available in most labs. Plating and subsequent quantification of various dilution series using the automated microscopy-based cytometer demonstrates the single-cell sensitivity , near-perfect
