  Iron oxide particle-decorated , hollow , carbon nanofibers ( HCNFs) , with poly ( styrene-co-acrylonitrile) solution as the core and acetic acid lignin as the shell , were manufactured using a coaxial electrospinning technique , using iron ( III) acetylacetonate as the iron oxide-precursor additive in the shell. The fabricated HCNFs exhibited a high specific capacitance of 121 F Â· g
