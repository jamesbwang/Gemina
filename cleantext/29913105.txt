  Immunogenicity data from phase 1 vaccine studies can be difficult to interpret , especially in seropositive populations and when multiple assays are used. We developed 3 statistical methods ( Youden index ( YI) threshold , receiver-operating characteristic relative to baseline ( ROC-B) , and ROC of postdose levels ( ROC-P)) to characterize complex immunogenicity data by assessing the proportion of a study population that achieved values above thresholds. The YI method calculates a single threshold per assay. Both ROC methods construct ROC curves for individual assays and surfaces for assay combinations to assess degree of separation of postdose values from a reference distribution; the ROC-B method uses overall predose values as the reference distribution and the ROC-P method uses pooled postdose values. All methods are applicable to a seropositive population with overlapping distributions of baseline and postdose measurements and can evaluate results of multiple assays jointly. The ROC-P method is also applicable when postdose levels are fully separated from baseline levels , as is common in a seronegative population. These methods were demonstrated using data from a phase 1a study of respiratory<pathogen> syncytial<pathogen> virus<pathogen> vaccines formulated with and without an adjuvant in a seropositive population of adults aged â‰¥ 60 years. All 3 methods provided a comprehensive assessment of vaccine immunogenicity effects with results presented in easily interpretable formats. In the example data , the methods demonstrated antigen dose response trend and contribution of adjuvant to response in multiple assays individually and jointly where optimal responses in assay combinations ( humoral and cellular) are important.
