  The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of leg kick on the resistance force in front-crawl swimming. The active drag in front-crawl swimming with and without leg motion was evaluated using measured values of residual thrust ( MRT method) and compared with the passive drag of the streamlined position ( SP) for the same swimmers. Seven male competitive swimmers participated in this study , and the testing was conducted in a swimming flume. Each swimmer performed front-crawl under two conditions: using arms and legs ( whole stroke: WS) and using arms only ( arms-only stroke: AS). Active drag and passive drag were measured at swimming velocities of 1.1 and 1.3 m s
