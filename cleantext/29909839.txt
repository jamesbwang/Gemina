  Marine diatoms negatively affect reproduction and later larval development of dominant zooplankton grazers such as copepods , thereby lowering the recruitment of the next generations of these small crustaceans that are a major food source for larval fish species. The phenomenon has been explained in terms of chemical defense due to grazer-induced synthesis of oxylipins , lipoxygenase-derived oxygenated fatty acid derivatives. Since this first report , studies about diatom oxylipins have multiplied and broadened toward other aspects concerning bloom dynamics , cell growth , and cell differentiation. Diatom oxylipins embrace a number of diverse structures that are recognized as chemical signals in ecological and physiological processes in many other organisms. In diatoms , the most studied examples include polyunsaturated aldehydes ( PUAs) and nonvolatile oxylipins ( NVOs). The purpose of this chapter is to provide the analytical tools to deal with identification , analysis and biosynthesis of these compounds. Emphasis is given to identification of the enzymatic steps and characterization of the species-specific lipoxygenases even in absence of the availability of molecular information.
