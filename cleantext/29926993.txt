  Childhood nutrition is important in optimising growth , development and future health. The present study compared dietary intakes of Australian children aged 4-8 years with ( i) Australian Guide to Healthy Eating ( AGHE) food group recommendations and ( ii) age-specific Nutrient Reference Values ( NRVs) , in addition to ( iii) describing food group intakes of children meeting key NRVs. Data were obtained from a representative sample of children ( n = 789) from the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey between May 2011 and June 2012. Parent-reported 24-h recall dietary data were disaggregated into five core food groups , along with energy-dense , nutrient-poor ( EDNP) foods , with intakes being compared with AGHE recommendations. Food group intakes were compared for children meeting the NRVs for 10 nutrients used for the development of AGHE food groups. Chi-squared and t-tests were performed to determine differences in food group intakes with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Only one child met the recommended daily servings for all AGHE core food groups and none met both core and energy-dense , nutrient-poor ( EDNP) food group recommendations. The lowest level of alignment ( percentage meeting recommendations) was for vegetables ( 4.6 %) and the highest was for fruit ( 47.7 %). Mean ( SD) daily intake of EDNP foods ( 4.7 ( 3.2) serves day Significant discrepancies exist between contemporary dietary patterns of Australian children and national recommendations. Future AGHE revisions should incorporate greater diversity of consumption patterns , including sub-categories of EDNP foods.
