  Candidiasis is the most common opportunistic fungal infection of the oral cavity caused by fungi<pathogen> of the genus Candida and usually associated with immunosuppressed individuals. To evaluate the presence of oral candidiasis and identify the presence of Candida<pathogen> spp. in liver transplant recipients and assess the association between the presence of the fungus and sociodemographic variables , dietary habits and environmental exposure. A cross-sectional study was performed with 49 patients who had undergone liver transplants at Hospital São Vicente de Paulo in Passo Fundo- RS. Patient information was collected to obtain sociodemographic data , eating habits and environmental exposure. Fungal infections were screened by oral clinical examination and the presence of Candida spp by the collection of oral samples with a sterile swab , seeded in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar , incubated at 25 °C and observed at 48 hours. To identify Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> , the germ tube test was performed. In 49 patient samples , 39 % had the yeast of the genus Candida<pathogen> isolated and , of these patients , 12 % had candidiasis , 66 % of atrophic type and 34 % pseudomembranous. Eleven yeast species were ( 58 %) Candida non-albicans and eight ( 42 %) Candida<pathogen> albicans<pathogen> The present study presents as a limitation the inclusion of patients in different stages of immunosuppression. The high incidence of Candida non-albicans in the oral cavity of transplant patients with a long period of transplantation is warning to a more effective control of the health of these individuals , especially those with older age.
