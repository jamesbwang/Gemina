  To evaluate the effect of an additional partial repair in combination with an arthroscopically assisted transfer of the latissimus dorsi ( LDT) in massive postero-superior irreparable cuff tear. Thirty-one patients ( mean age 59.2 years) scheduled for arthroscopically assisted LDT either isolated or in combination with a partial cuff repair for a massive posterior-superior cuff tear were prospectively included between January 2011 and December 2013 at our institution. Seventeen had an isolated transfer ( Group A) and 14 had a transfer combined with a partial cuff repair ( Group B). Outcome measures included visual analogue scale ( VAS) , range of motion , strength , constant score , and subjective shoulder value ( SSV). Potential predictive factors were analyzed. At the last follow-up ( mean 22 months) , patients in Group B had a significantly higher constant score ( 64 ± 8 versus 58 ± 4 in Group A) , range of motion ( 33 ± 5 versus 29 ± 5 points in Group A) , and strength at 90 ° of abduction ( 2.5 kg ± 1 in Group B versus 1.9 kg ± 0.9 in Group A). No significant differences were found between both groups regarding pain scores , SSV , and active external rotation. Thirty-seven variables were analyzed and the only factor which was found to be predictive of a bad result was a preoperative SSV < 40 pts. ( RR 0.5). Arthroscopically assisted LDT gives better results when combined with a partial repair of the cuff than when it is performed isolated in the treatment of massive irreparable postero-superior rotator cuff tear.
