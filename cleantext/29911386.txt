  Nanostructures in silicon ( Si) induced by phase transformations have been investigated during the past 50 years. Performances of nanostructures are improved compared to that of bulk counterparts. Nevertheless , the confinement and loading conditions are insufficient to machine and fabricate high-performance devices. As a consequence , nanostructures fabricated by nanoscale deformation at loading speeds of m/s have not been demonstrated yet. In this study , grinding or scratching at a speed of 40.2 m/s was performed on a custom-made setup by an especially designed diamond tip ( calculated stress under the diamond tip in the order of 5.11 GPa). This leads to a novel approach for the fabrication of nanostructures by nanoscale deformation at loading speeds of m/s. A new deformation-induced nanostructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM) , consisting of an amorphous phase , a new tetragonal phase , slip bands , twinning superlattices , and a single crystal. The formation mechanism of the new phase was elucidated by ab initio simulations at shear stress of about 2.16 GPa. This approach opens a new route for the fabrication of nanostructures by nanoscale deformation at speeds of m/s. Our findings provide new insights for potential applications in transistors , integrated circuits , diodes , solar cells , and energy storage systems.
