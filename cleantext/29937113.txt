  Sales of electronic vapor products have increased in recent years. This increase in use may be related to manufacturer price promotions. This study assessed the use of price-related promotions among current electronic vapor product users. Data from the 2015 and 2016 Summer Styles , an Internet survey of U.S. adults aged ≥ 18 years , were analyzed in 2017. Current electronic vapor product users ( n = 300) were those who reported past 30-day electronic vapor product use. Price-related promotion use was defined as reported use of coupons , rebates , discount codes , or other special price-related promotions when purchasing electronic vapor products ( e.g. , electronic cigarettes ( e-cigarettes) , electronic hookah ( e-hookah) , or vape pens). Associations between price-related promotion use and sex , age , race/ethnicity , educational attainment , U.S. region , cigarette smoking status , electronic vapor product use frequency , place electronic vapor products were obtained , and survey year were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Among current electronic vapor product users , 15.0 % reported using price-related promotions. The adjusted odds of using price-related promotions was significantly higher among respondents who obtained electronic vapor products from a gas station , grocery or drug store , or the Internet ( AOR = 2.65 , 95 % CI = 1.22 , 5.74) versus anywhere else ( i.e. , mall kiosks , vape shop , friends/family) and among those who used electronic vapor products ≥ 15 days in the past 30 days ( AOR = 2.57 , 95 % CI = 1.18 , 5.56) versus ≤ 14 days. Nearly one in seven current U.S. adult electronic vapor product users reported using price promotions during 2015-2016 , and variations in price promotion use existed by electronic vapor product use frequency and where electronic vapor products were obtained. Continued monitoring of the use of price-related promotions could help inform public health policy , planning , and practice.
