  The relationship of melatonin ( MT) level , oxidative stress and inflammatory status with osteoporosis in the maintenance hemodialysis ( MHD) of chronic renal<symptom> failure<symptom> was investigated. Ninety-four patients with chronic renal<symptom> failure<symptom> treated in Dezhou People 's Hospital ( Dezhoo , China) and receiving MHD for more than 3 months from May to April 2017 were selected and divided into the osteoporosis group ( observation group , n = 49) and the non-osteoporosis group ( control group , n = 45) based on whether osteoporosis was involved. The serum advanced oxidation protein products ( AOPP) , MT level and inflammatory factors ( tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6) and IL-1) in patients were detected via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA). Moreover , the malondialdehyde ( MDA) level in serum was detected via thibabituric acid ( TBA) assay and the spinal bone mineral density ( BMD) was detected using the total BMD testing instrument , followed by correlation analysis. The MT level in observation group was significantly lower than that in control group , but the levels of AOPP and MDA were significantly higher than those in control group ( P < 0.05). The levels of inflammatory factors ( TNF-α , IL-6 and IL-1) in observation group were obviously higher than those in the control group ( P < 0.05). Besides , the spinal BMD and T-value in observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group ( P < 0.05). Pearson 's correlation analysis showed that AOPP , MDA , TNF-α , IL-6 and IL-1 levels were negatively correlated with BMD , but MT was positively correlated with BMD ( P < 0.05). Osteoporosis occurs easily in MHD patients; oxidative stress and inflammatory degree are negatively correlated with osteoporosis , but MT is positively correlated with osteoporosis.
