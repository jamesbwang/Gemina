  There is an urgent demand for wound<disease> healing biomaterials because of the increasing frequency of traffic accidents , industrial contingencies , and natural disasters. Borate bioactive glass has potential applications in bone tissue engineering and wound<disease> healing; however , its uncontrolled release runs a high risk of rapid degradation and transient biotoxicity. In this study , a novel organic-inorganic dressing of copper-doped borate bioactive glass/poly ( lactic- co-glycolic acid) loaded with vitamin E ( 0-3.0 wt % vitamin E) was fabricated to evaluate its efficiency for angiogenesis in cells and full-thickness skin wounds<disease> healing in rodents. In vitro results showed the dressing was an ideal interface for the organic-inorganic mixture and a controlled release system for Cu
