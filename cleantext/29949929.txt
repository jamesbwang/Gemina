  Malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM) is a thoracic aggressive cancer caused by asbestos exposure , which is difficult to diagnose and treat. Here , we characterized an in vivo orthotopic xenograft model consisting of human mesothelioma cells ( designed as H2052/484) derived from a pleural NCI-H2052 tumor injected in partially immunodeficient athymic mice. We assessed tumor formation and tumor-dependent patterns of inflammation<symptom>. H2052/484 cells conserved their mesothelioma phenotype and most characteristics from the parental NCI-H2052 cells. After intra-thoracic injection of H2052/484 cells , thoracic tumors developed in nearly all mice ( 86 %) within 14 days , faster than from parental NCI-H2052 cells. When the mice were euthanized , the pleural lavage fluid was examined for immune cell profiles. The pleural immune cell population increased with tumor development. Interestingly , the proportion of myeloid-derived suppressor cell and macrophage ( especially CD206 ‚Å∫ M2 macrophages) populations increased in the pleural fluid of mice with large mesothelioma development , as previously observed in immunocompetent mice. This reliable orthotopic model recapitulates human mesothelioma and may be used for the study of new treatment strategies.
