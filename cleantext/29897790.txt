  Guselkumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG1Î» antibody for the treatment of plaque psoriasis that inhibits interleukin ( IL) -23 p19 subunit , reducing the proliferation of type 17 helper T ( Th-17) cells and thus production of Th-17-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines , especially IL-17 and IL-22. Areas covered: In the following article , the mechanism of action and mainly the efficacy and safety profile of guselkumab available from results of trials will be discussed. We summarized these data after a literature review including PubMed search , relating proceedings and abstracts from relevant international conferences , assessment reports from European and United States regulatory agencies and treatment guidelines up to April 2018. Expert opinion: The central role of IL-23 in psoriasis pathogenesis is supported by genetic links of IL-23 and IL-23R alleles to psoriasis susceptibility; early clinical trials have demonstrated that sufficient inhibition of IL-23p19 results in rapid resolution of the disease. Targeting IL-23 , may be responsible for the high efficacy and durable responses of guselkumab , avoiding some adverse effects of IL-17A blockade , like mucocutaneous candida<pathogen> infections or triggering/worsening of inflammatory bowel disease , experienced with agents acting selectively against this molecule and that seem to be class related.
