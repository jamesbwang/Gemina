  To explore the effects of fluoride on autophagy level in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with different concentrations ( 20 , 40 , 60 mg/L) of fluoride for 24 h. Transmission electron microscope ( TEM) was used to detect the ultrastructure of autophagosomes in SH-SY5Y cells. Acridine orange staining was used to examine the form of autophagic vesicles and Western blotting was used to check the expression levels of autophagy relevant proteins of Atg5 , LC3 and P62 in SH-SY5 Y cells. The TEM results showed the presence of autophagic ultrastructure in SH-SY5Y cells and fluoride could decrease the amount of autophagosomes. Acridine orange staining results showed that the amount of autophagic vesicles were obviously decreased in 40 and 60 mg/L Na F-treated groups compared with control , and 60 mg/L Na F-treated group was decreased the most. The expression level of Atg5 and LC3-II protein was dose-dependently decrease and P62 protein was dosedependently increased compared with control ( P < 0. 05). Fluoride maysuppress the level of autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells.
