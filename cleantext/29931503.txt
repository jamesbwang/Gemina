  Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide ( PACAP) is a 27- or 38-amino acid neuropeptide , which belongs to the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/glucagon/secretin family of peptides. PACAP and its three receptor subtypes are expressed in neural tissues and in the eye , including the retina , cornea , and lacrimal gland. PACAP is known to exert pleiotropic effects on the central nervous system and in eye tissues where it plays important roles in protecting against dry eye. This review provides an overview of current knowledge regarding dry eye symptoms in aged animals and humans and the protective effects , mechanisms of action. In addition , we also refer to the development of a new preventive/therapeutic method by PACAP of dry eye patients.
