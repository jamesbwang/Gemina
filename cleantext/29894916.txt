  Smoke-free air laws and the denormalization of smoking are important contributors to reductions in smoking during the 21st century. Yet , tobacco policy and denormalization may intersect in numerous ways to affect smoking. We merge data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 , Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey , American Nonsmokers ' Right Foundation , and Census to produce a unique examination of the intersection of smoking bans and denormalization and their influence on any smoking and heavy smoking among young adults. Operationalizing denormalization as complete unacceptability of smoking within nightlife venues , we examine 1) whether smoking bans and denormalization have independent effects on smoking , 2) whether denormalization mediates the influence of smoking bans on smoking , and 3) whether denormalization moderates the impact of smoking bans on smoking. For any smoking , denormalization has a significant independent effect beyond the influence of smoking bans. For heavy smoking , denormalization mediates the relationship between smoking bans and habitual smoking. Denormalization does not moderate the relationship of smoking bans with either pattern of smoking. This research identifies that the intersection of denormalization and smoking bans plays an important role in lowering smoking , yet they remain distinct in their influences. Notably , smoking bans are efficacious even in locales with lower levels of denormalization , particularly for social smoking.
