  We hypothesized that an increase in BMI category during neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC) would be associated with pathological complete response ( pCR) rate and worse survival outcomes in primary breast cancer patients. We reviewed the records of 4029 patients with stage I-III breast cancer who had undergone NAC and definitive surgery at our institution between May 1 , 1990 and April 30 , 2013. BMI values at baseline and after NAC were recorded , and the corresponding BMI category was assessed with the WHO classification. Overall survival ( OS) and recurrence-free survival ( RFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method , and multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimate the effect of covariates of interest on OS and RFS. The median follow-up period was 3.95 years. A change in BMI category from normal to obese during NAC was independently associated with shorter OS duration than was maintaining a normal weight ( hazard ratio ( HR) 1.637; 95 % CI 1.066-2.514; p = 0.0242). Kaplan-Meier curves among breast cancer subtypes showed differences , and a decrease in BMI led to better RFS and OS rates in obese patients with HR +/ HER2- disease; those who maintained BMI also showed better prognosis for triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC). We saw no association between BMI change and pCR rate. Our data suggest that inability to maintain normal weight during NAC is a predictive marker of poor survival but not pCR. It may be important for patients to maintain a normal weight during NAC.
