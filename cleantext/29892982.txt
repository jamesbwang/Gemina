  Electric control of exchange bias ( EB) is of vital importance in energy-efficient spintronics. Although many attempts have been made during the past decade , each has its own limitations for operation and thus falls short of full direct and reversible electrical control of EB at room temperature. Here , a novel approach is proposed by virtue of unipolar resistive switching to accomplish this task in a Si/SiO
