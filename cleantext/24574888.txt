  Structural damage identification based on finite element ( FE) model updating has been a research direction of increasing interest over the last decade in the mechanical , civil , aerospace , etc. , engineering fields. Various studies have addressed direct , sensitivity-based , probabilistic , statistical , and iterative methods for updating FE models for structural damage identification. In contrast , evolutionary algorithms ( EAs) are a type of modern method for FE model updating. Structural damage identification using FE model updating by evolutionary algorithms is an active research focus in progress but lacking a comprehensive survey. In this situation , this study aims to present a review of critical aspects of structural damage identification using evolutionary algorithm-based FE model updating. First , a theoretical background including the structural damage detection problem and the various types of FE model updating approaches is illustrated. Second , the various residuals between dynamic characteristics from FE model and the corresponding physical model , used for constructing the objective function for tracking damage , are summarized. Third , concerns regarding the selection of parameters for FE model updating are investigated. Fourth , the use of evolutionary algorithms to update FE models for damage detection is examined. Fifth , a case study comparing the applications of two single-objective EAs and one multi-objective EA for FE model updating-based damage detection is presented. Finally , possible research directions for utilizing evolutionary algorithm-based FE model updating to solve damage detection problems are recommended. This study should help researchers find crucial points for further exploring theories , methods , and technologies of evolutionary algorithm-based FE model updating for structural damage detection.
