  After spinal cord injury , the number of glial cells and motor neurons expressing bone morphogenetic protein 7 ( BMP7) increases , indicating that upregulation of BMP7 can promote nerve repair. We , therefore , tested whether direct injection of BMP7 into acutely injured rat spinal cord can affect neurological recovery. Allen 's impactor was used to create spinal cord injury at T
