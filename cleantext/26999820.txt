  Forest<disease> structure is strongly related to forest<disease> ecology , and it is a key parameter to understand ecosystem processes and services. Airborne laser scanning ( ALS) is becoming an important tool in environmental mapping. It is increasingly common to collect ALS data at high enough point density to recognize individual tree crowns ( ITCs) allowing analyses to move beyond classical stand-level approaches. In this study , an effective and simple method to map ITCs , and their stem diameter and aboveground biomass ( AGB) is presented. ALS data were used to delineate ITCs and to extract ITCs ' height and crown diameter; then , using newly developed allometries , the ITCs ' diameter at breast height ( DBH) and AGB were predicted. Gini coefficient of DBHs was also predicted and mapped aggregating ITCs predictions. Two datasets from spruce dominated temperate forests were considered: one was used to develop the allometric models , while the second was used to validate the methodology. The proposed approach provides accurate predictions of individual DBH and AGB (
