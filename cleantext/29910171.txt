  The objective of this study was to quantify the hemodynamic parameters using first pass analysis of T MRI of the breast was performed in 50 women ( mean age , 44 Â± 11 ( SD) years; range: 26-75) years with a total of 15 benign and 35 malignant breast lesions<symptom>. After pre-processing , T All quantitative parameters except leakage volume ( Ve) , qualitative ( type-I and III) and semi-quantitative curves ( type-I and III) provided significant differences ( P < 0.05) between benign and malignant lesions<symptom>. Kinetic parameters , particularly volume transfer coefficient ( K Quantitative parameters , particularly rBBVcorr and K
