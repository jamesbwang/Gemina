  In chronic lymphocytic leukemia<disease> ( CLL) disease onset and progression are influenced by the behavior of specific CD4 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from newly diagnosed CLL patients ( n = 25) and healthy volunteers ( n = 25). The phenotypic and functional characterization of Tregs and their subsets was assessed by flow cytometry. In vitro analysis of TH1 , TH2 , TH17 and Tregs cytokines was evaluated by IFN-Î³ , IL-4 , IL-17A and IL-10 secretion assays. The transcriptional profiling of 84 genes panel was evaluated by RT In all CLL samples , we found a significant increase in the frequency of IL-10-secreting Tregs and Tregs subsets , a significant rise of TH2 IL-4 Our data show that Tregs switch towards an effector-like phenotype in CLL patients. This multifaceted behavior is accompanied by an altered cytokine profiling and transcriptional program of immune genes , leading to a dysfunction in immune response in the peripheral blood environment of CLL patients.
