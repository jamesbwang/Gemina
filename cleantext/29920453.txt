  A series of 2-mercapto-6-phenylpyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid derivatives ( 7a c , 8a e , 9a e and 10a e) as novel xanthine oxidase inhibitors were designed based on molecular docking , and synthesized by a new method using ketoenol acids and thiourea as the starting materials. In vitro activity assay indicated that most of the designed compounds displayed submicromolar inhibitory potency. Specifically , compound 9b had the most potent enzyme inhibitory activity with the IC
