  The Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV) oncoproteins latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1) and LMP2A constitutively activate multiple signaling pathways , and both have been shown to interact with cellular ubiquitin ligases and affect cellular ubiquitination. To detect the LMP1- and LMP2A-mediated effects on the global cellular proteome , epithelial cell lines expressing LMP1 or LMP2A were analyzed using label-free quantitative proteomics. To identify proteins whose ubiquitination is affected by the viral proteins , the cells were cultured in the presence and absence of deubiquitinase ( DUB) and proteasome inhibitors. More than 7,700 proteins were identified with high confidence and considerably more proteins showed significant differences in expression in the presence of inhibitors. Few of the differentially expressed proteins with or without inhibitors were common between LMP1 and LMP2A , confirming that the viral proteins induce unique changes in cell expression and function. However , ingenuity pathway analysis ( IPA) of the data indicated that LMP1 and LMP2A modulate many of the same cellular regulatory pathways , including cell death and survival , cell movement , and actin filament dynamics. In addition , various proteasome subunits , ubiquitin-specific peptidases and conjugating enzymes , vesicle trafficking proteins , and NF-ÎºB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling proteins were affected by LMP1 or LMP2A. These findings suggest that LMP1 and LMP2A may commonly target critical cell pathways through effects on distinct genes , with many cellular proteins modified by ubiquitination and/or degradation.
