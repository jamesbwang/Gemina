  The neuro-ichthyotic diseases are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and neuroradiological findings and to analyze mutation in 15 patients with neuro-ichthyotic diseases. We retrospectively analyzed the records of 15 patients with the diagnosis of neuro-ichthyotic diseases. Eight female and seven male patients ( age range 11 months-52 years) were investigated. There were eight patients with Sj√∂gren-Larsson syndrome<disease> ( SLS) , five patients with multiple sulfatase deficiency ( MSD) , one patient with Chanarin-Dorfman 's syndrome<disease> , and one patient with mental retardation , enteropathy , deafness , neuropathy , ichthyosis , and keratodermia ( MEDNIK) syndrome<disease>. Parental consanguinity was found in all the patients except one. All patients had ichthyosis. Diagnosis was performed with genetic study. Because biochemical and clinical findings are variable , the diagnosis is difficult in most of the cases. Detailed skin and physical examinations are mandatory in these patients. Genetic tests are necessary for accurate diagnosis.
