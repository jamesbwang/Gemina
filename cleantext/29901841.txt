  Land-based plants and ocean-dwelling microbial phototrophs known as phytoplankton , are together responsible for almost all global primary production. Habitat warming associated with anthropogenic climate change has detrimentally impacted marine primary production , with the effects observed on regional and global scales. In contrast to slower-growing higher plants , there is considerable potential for phytoplankton to evolve rapidly with changing environmental conditions. The energetic constraints associated with adaptation in phytoplankton are not yet understood , but are central to forecasting how global biogeochemical cycles respond to contemporary ocean change. Here , we demonstrate a number of potential trade-offs associated with high-temperature adaptation in a tropical microbial eukaryote , Amphidinium massartii ( dinoflagellate). Most notably , the population became high-temperature specialized ( higher fitness within a narrower thermal envelope and higher thermal optimum) , and had a greater nutrient requirement for carbon , nitrogen and phosphorus. Evidently , the energetic constraints associated with living at elevated temperature alter competiveness along other environmental gradients. While high-temperature adaptation led to an irreversible change in biochemical composition ( i.e. , an increase in fatty acid saturation) , the mechanisms underpinning thermal evolution in phytoplankton remain unclear , and will be crucial to understanding whether the trade-offs observed here are species-specific or are representative of the evolutionary constraints in all phytoplankton.
