  Obese , African-American ( AA) adolescents are at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency. The primary objective of this pilot study was to examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation upon 25-hydroxy vitamin D ( 25OHD) levels in obese , AA adolescents. A randomized , double-blinded , controlled pilot study included 26 obese ( BMI ≥ 95 % ile) , vitamin D deficient ( 25OHD < 20 ng/mL) , pubertal AA adolescents ( ages 12-17). Subjects received cholecalciferol 1000 IU or 5000 IU daily for 3 months. Serum 25OHD , vitamin D binding protein , parathyroid hormone , and cardiometabolic risk markers were obtained at baseline and post-treatment. Of 39 subjects enrolled , 26 ( 67 %) were vitamin D deficient ( mean 25OHD 12.0 ± 3.8 ng/mL) at baseline and were randomized , with 22 completing the study. Sex , age , season , pubertal stage , BMI , insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR) and 25OHD were similar at baseline between the 1000 IU and 5000 IU groups. Post-treatment , 25OHD increased less in the 1000 IU group ( 5.6 ng/mL , p = 0.03) vs. the 5000 IU group ( 15.6 ng/mL , p = 0.002). 83 % of the 5000 IU group and 30 % of the 1000 IU group reached post-treatment 25OHD ≥ 20 ng/mL ( p = 0.01); 50 % of the 5000 IU group , but no subject from the 1000 IU group , achieved 25OHD ≥ 30 ng/mL ( p = 0.009). We detected no group differences in mineral metabolites or cardiometabolic risk markers following supplementation. Cholecalciferol dosing in excess of the current Institute of Medicine dietary reference intakes was required to achieve 25OHD levels ≥ 20 ng/mL in obese , AA adolescents. Supplementation of 5000 IU may be required to achieve the desired goal.
