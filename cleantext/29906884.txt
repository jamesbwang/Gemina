  This paper reports a nonuniform ionic size nonlocal Poisson-Fermi double-layer model ( nuNPF) and a uniform ionic size nonlocal Poisson-Fermi double-layer model ( uNPF) for an electrolyte mixture of multiple ionic species , variable voltages on electrodes , and variable induced charges on boundary segments. The finite element solvers of nuNPF and uNPF are developed and applied to typical double-layer tests defined on a rectangular box , a hollow sphere , and a hollow rectangle with a charged post. Numerical results show that nuNPF can significantly improve the quality of the ionic concentrations and electric fields generated from uNPF , implying that the effect of nonuniform ion sizes is a key consideration in modeling the double-layer structure.
