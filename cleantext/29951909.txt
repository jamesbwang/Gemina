  Understanding patients ' concerns and goals is essential for providing individualised care in urogynaecology. The study objectives were to undertake a content analysis of free-text concerns and goals recorded by patients using an electronic pelvic-floor questionnaire ( ePAQ-PF) and measure how these related to self-reported symptom and health-related quality-of-life ( HRQOL) data also recorded using ePAQ-PF. A total of 1996 consenting patients completed ePAQ-PF. Content analysis was undertaken of free-text responses to the item: ` Considering the issues that currently concern you the most , what do you hope to achieve from any help , advice or treatment? ' Key content themes were identified by the lead researcher , and three researchers read and coded all recorded responses. Student 's t test was used to compare ePAQ-PF domain scores for patients reporting concerns in the relevant domain with those who did not. In total , 63 % of participants who completed the questionnaire , recorded at least one free-text item. Content analysis identified 1560 individual concerns coding into the 19 ePAQ-PF domains. Symptom scores were significantly higher for patients reporting free-text concerns in 18 domains ( p < 0.05). Additional concerns relating specifically to body image were recorded by 11 % of patients. Key areas of importance emerging for personal goals included cure/improvement , better understanding , incontinence pad use , sexual function and surgery. Free-text reporting in ePAQ-PF is utilised by patients and facilitates self-expression and discussion of issues impacting on HRQOL. The significant relationship between recorded free-text concerns and ePAQ-PF domain scores suggests convergent validity for the instrument. Development and psychometric testing of a domain to assess body image is proposed.
