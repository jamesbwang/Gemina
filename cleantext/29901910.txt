  Capstesia is an app for smartphones that can serve as a simple , accessible and affordable alternative to current advanced hemodynamic monitoring devices. The aim of this paper was to establish the degree of concordance between the Vigileo monitor and the Capstesia app in the measurement of cardiac output in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A process study was conducted that included 30 patients whose cardiac output was measured simultaneously with the Capstesia app and the Vigileo monitor. The analysis was done using the Lin 's concordance correlation coefficient and Student 's t- test. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. The information was processed in SPSS v. 22.0. 332 paired samples were taken. The cardiac output values obtained were 4.43 ± 1.37 L/min for the Vigileo monitor and 4.45 ± 1.38 L/min for the Capstesia app. Lin 's concordance correlation coefficient yielded a value of 0.966 with a confidence range of 0.958-0.973. There is substantial concordance between the cardiac output values yielded by the Vigileo monitor and the Capstesia app in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
