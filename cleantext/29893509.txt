  Recently , platelet-derived growth factors present in lysates became an extreme interest in the field of regenerative medicine such as in wound<disease> healing and as substitutes to foetal bovine serum in xeno-free cell culture systems. However , the generation of such platelet lysates completely depends on the availability of platelet donors. In this study , the possibility to use in vitro-generated megakaryocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs) as a cell source for typical platelet growth factors was investigated. Therefore , the presence and levels of those factors were characterized in in vitro-produced megakaryocytes. In comparison with platelets , in vitro-generated megakaryocytes showed a multifold increased content in transcript and protein levels of typical platelet growth factors including platelet-derived growth factors ( PDGFs) , transforming growth factor ( TGF) -1 Î² , vascular endothelial cell factor ( VEGF)- A , epidermal growth factor ( EGF) , insulin-like growth factor ( IGF) -1 and tissue factor ( TF). Hence , iPSC-derived megakaryocytes may serve as an efficient cell source for a donor-independent generation of growth factor-rich lysates with a broad application potential in innovative cell culture systems and regenerative therapies.
