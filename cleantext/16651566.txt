  The purpose of the present study was to evaluate intra-articular ozone injection following arthroscopic surgery for knee osteoarthritis ( OA) with regard to its efficacy in pain reduction , joint function and quality of life improvement. The present study retrospectively evaluated 80 patients with symptomatic knee OA ( Kellgren-Lawrence grade II or III) , who either did or did not receive 20 ml of 20 Âµg/ml ozone as an intra-articular injection after arthroscopic surgery. The minimum follow-up period was 12 months. The outcomes evaluated for knee OA were pain on the Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS) , Lequesne Index , Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC) and Clinical Global Impression ( CGI). The VAS score in the ozone group was significantly better than that in the control group at all post-operative follow-up time-points ( P < 0.05). The ozone group also exhibited a significantly greater improvement in Lequesne Index scores ( P < 0.05). In the ozone group , the score on the WOMAC-pain , WOMAC-stiffness and WOMAC-function subscales , as well as the total WOMAC score decreased significantly ( P < 0.05). Furthermore , in the ozone group a significantly higher number of patients ( P < 0.05) with better CGI grades was encountered compared with that in the control group at the 12-month follow-up assessment , despite comparable baseline values in all aforementioned clinical measures between the two groups of patients. The present study suggests that intra-articular ozone injections after arthroscopic surgery may effectively improve the outcomes of arthroscopic surgery in terms of pain relief , functional improvement and quality of life in patients with knee OA of Kellgren-Lawrence grade II or III.
