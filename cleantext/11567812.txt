  Epithelioid sarcoma<disease> first described by Enzinger ( Cancer 26:1029-41 , 1970) is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma<disease> typically presenting as a subcutaneous or deep dermal mass in distal portions of the extremities of adolescents and young adults. They are frequently mistaken for ulcers<disease> , abscesses<disease> , or infected warts<disease> that fail medical management. Patients often develop multiple local recurrences of long duration , with subsequent metastases in 30 to 50 % of cases ( Chase and Enzinger ( Am J Surg Pathol 9:241-63 , 1985)). We here report a case of left thumb epithelioid sarcoma<disease> that presented as an ulcer<disease> and subsequently metastasized to forearm , arm , axillary lymph nodes , and lungs.
