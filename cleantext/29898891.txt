  Although germline genetics influences breast cancer incidence , published research only explains approximately half of the expected association. Moreover , the accuracy of prediction models remains low. For women who develop breast cancer early , the genetic architecture is less established. To identify loci associated with early-onset breast cancer , gene-based tests were carried out using exome array data from 3479 women with breast cancer diagnosed before age 50 and 973 age-matched controls. Replication was undertaken in a population that developed breast cancer at all ages of onset. Three gene regions were associated with breast cancer incidence: FGFR2 ( p = 1.23 ⋅ 10- 5; replication p < 1.00 ⋅ 10- 6) , NEK10 ( p = 3.57 ⋅ 10- 4; replication p < 1.00 ⋅ 10- 6) , and SIVA1 ( p = 5.49 ⋅ 10- 4; replication p < 1.00 ⋅ 10- 6). Of the 151 gene regions reported in previous literature , 19 ( 12.5 %) showed evidence of association ( p < 0.05) with the risk of early-onset breast cancer in the early-onset population. To predict incidence , whole-genome prediction was implemented on a subset of 3076 participants who were additionally genotyped on a genome wide array. The whole-genome prediction outperformed a polygenic risk score ( AUC: 0.636; 95 % CI: 0.614-0.659 compared to 0.601; 95 % CI: 0.578-0.623) , and when combined with known epidemiologic risk factors , the AUC rose to 0.662 ( 95 % CI: 0.640-0.684). This research supports a role for variation within FGFR2 and NEK10 in breast cancer incidence , and suggests SIVA1 as a novel risk locus. This analysis supports a shared genetic etiology between women with early- and late-onset breast cancer , and suggests whole-genome data can improve risk assessment.
