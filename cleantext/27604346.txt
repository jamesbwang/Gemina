  Coral reefs can provide significant coastal protection benefits to people and property. Here we show that the annual expected damages from flooding would double , and costs from frequent storms would triple without reefs. For 100-year storm events , flood damages would increase by 91 % to $ US 272 billion without reefs. The countries with the most to gain from reef management are Indonesia , Philippines , Malaysia , Mexico , and Cuba; annual expected flood savings exceed $ 400 M for each of these nations. Sea-level rise will increase flood risk , but substantial impacts could happen from reef loss alone without better near-term management. We provide a global , process-based valuation of an ecosystem service across an entire marine biome at ( sub) national levels. These spatially explicit benefits inform critical risk and environmental management decisions , and the expected benefits can be directly considered by governments ( e.g. , national accounts , recovery plans) and businesses ( e.g. , insurance).
