  Testicular Leydig cell tumor ( LCT) is a rare neoplasm. It commonly presents as a painless testicular mass with or without endocrine changes. Histological and immunohistochemical examination play important roles in differentiating LCT from testicular germ cell tumors. We highlight the imaging phenotype , as well as the pathological findings of a case of LCT in a 62-year-old male. Preoperative noncontrast CT scan of the abdomen revealed a 7.0 × 6.4 × 5.3 cm oval mass with heterogeneous density , located in the right testis. Pelvic noncontrast MRI showed a heterogeneous mass on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. The solid part of the tumor exhibited high signal on the diffusion-weighted imaging , and an obvious enhancement on the contrast-enhanced MR imaging. Ultrasonography examination demonstrated a large mixed echogenic space occupying lesion<symptom> involving the whole right testis with multiple cystic areas and increased vascularity. This patient underwent radical orchiectomy. The pathologic diagnosis was LCT. This patient underwent operative resection of the tumor. Due to the negative resection margins and absence of distant metastases , the patient did not receive additional radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Four months after the surgery , the follow-up CT-scan did not reveal any local recurrence and distant metastases. This case improves our ability to detect and diagnose LCT by summarizing its imaging characteristics as well as reviewing the literature. Additionally , we described the state-of-the-art management of the management of this rare tumor.
