  Commercial sex shares a role in HIV<pathogen> and sexually transmitted infections ( STI) transmission. Men who pay for sex ( MPS) may transmit HIV/STI to other populations which are low-risk. This study aimed to test our hypothesis that MPS engage in high-risk sexual behaviors associated with HIV/STI transmission more so than non-MPS. This cross-sectional study included heterosexual men who attended an STI clinic between 2003 and 2010. Demographic , clinical , behavioral and laboratory data were compared between MPS and non-MPS to identify factors associated with high-risk sexual behavior and STI-burden. Of the first visits of 6156 heterosexual men who attended the STI-clinic during the study period , 1649 ( 26.7 %) were MPS. MPS were more commonly older , married and non-Israeli born compared with non-MPS. MPS were more likely to engage in risk-behaviors associated with HIV/STI-transmission , including a greater number of lifetime sexual partners , substance use and previous STI diagnoses. Determinants associated with STI-diagnoses at the current visit included being non-Israeli born , presenting with STI symptoms , reporting a greater number of lifetime sexual partners and having sexual encounters with non-Israeli individuals. Approximately 25 % of all men who attended the clinic were MPS. They were more likely to engage in risk-behaviors associated with HIV/STI transmission compared to non-MPS. These findings highlight the need to establish interventions for MPS that both continue to encourage condom use and address the potential perils pertaining to risky sexual behaviors.
