  Mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK)/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK) signalling is implicated in initiation of embryonic stem ( ES) cell differentiation. The pathway is subject to complex feedback regulation. Here , we examined the ERK-responsive phosphoproteome in ES cells and identified the negative regulator RSK1 as a prominent target. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create combinatorial mutations in
