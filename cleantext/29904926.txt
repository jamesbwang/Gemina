  To compare transvaginal ultrasonography and hysteroscopy for the diagnosis of endometrial pathologies. In the present retrospective cohort study , data were reviewed from women with ultrasonography findings suggestive of endometrial lesions<symptom> and/or abnormal uterine bleeding who underwent hysteroscopy at a single center in Campinas , Brazil , between January 2011 and December 2013; data were stratified based on reproductive-aged and postmenopausal groups. The accuracy , sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV) , and negative predictive value ( NPV) of ultrasonography and hysteroscopy for the diagnosis of endometrial lesions<symptom> were determined. Histopathology was used as the gold standard. There were 754 patients included ( 256 reproductive age , 498 postmenopausal). In the reproductive-age group , ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 96.0 % , specificity of 58.0 % , PPV of 94.4 % , NPV of 66.6 % , and accuracy of 91.5 % , whereas hysteroscopy had a sensitivity of 91.8 % , specificity of 76.6 % , PPV of 96.0 % , NPV of 60.5 % , and accuracy of 89.7 % for the diagnosis of endometrial disease. In the postmenopausal group , ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 99.0 % , specificity of 19.0 % , PPV of 96.1 % , NPV of 50.0 % , and accuracy of 95.3 % , whereas hysteroscopy had a sensitivity of 96.7 % , specificity of 86.9 % , PPV of 99.2 % , NPV of 58.8 % , and accuracy of 96.2 %. Ultrasonography was found to be an effective method for the diagnosis of endometrial disease , especially among postmenopausal women.
