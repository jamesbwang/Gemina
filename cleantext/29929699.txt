  Approximately a third of patients presenting with long-bone non-union have undergone plate fixation as their primary procedure. In the assessment of a potential fracture non-union it is critical to understand the plating technique that the surgeon was intending to achieve at the primary procedure , i.e. whether it was direct or indirect fracture repair. The distinction between delayed union and non-union is a diagnostic dilemma especially in plated fractures , healing by primary bone repair. The distinction is important as nonunions are not necessarily part of the same spectrum as delayed unions. The etiology of a fracture non-union is usually multifactorial and the factors can be broadly categorized into mechanical factors , biological ( local and systemic) factors , and infection. Infection is present in ~ 40 % of fracture non-unions , often after open fractures or impaired wound<disease> healing , but in 5 % of all non-unions infection is present without any clinical or serological suspicion. Methods to improve the sensitivity of investigation in the search of infection include the use of; sonication of implants , direct inoculation of theatre specimens into broth , and histological examination of non-union site tissue. Awareness should be given to the potential anti-osteogenic effect of bisphosphonates ( in primary fracture repair) and certain classes of antibiotics. Early cases of delayed/non-union with sufficient mechanical stability and biologically active bone can be managed by stimulation of fracture healing. Late presenting non-union typically requires revision of the fixation construct and stimulation of the callus to induce fracture union.
