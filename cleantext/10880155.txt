  Dichlorodifluoromethane ( R-12) has been widely used as a radiator gas in pressure threshold Cherenkov detectors for high-energy particle physics. However , that compound is becoming unavailable due to the Montreal Protocol. To find a replacement with suitably high refractive index , we use a combination of theory and experiment to examine the polarizability and refractivity of several non-ozone-depleting compounds. Our measurements show that the fourth-generation refrigerants R-1234yf ( 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene) and R-1234ze ( E) (
