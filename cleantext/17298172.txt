  Microorganisms are extremely abundant on our planet , and , as a result , they interact with many others forms of life. Today , science recognizes the essential role of these organisms in the emergence and maintenance of life on Earth. Nonetheless , misconceptions about microorganisms in the imaginations of students and the lay audience persist. A major challenge in teaching and popularizing microbiology is to provide students and the general public with a varied understanding of microbes in nature to reinforce their importance in a multitude of processes. In this perspective article , I discuss the persistence of the association between microbes and disease in laypersons ' views. Moreover , I advocate for the adoption of a perspective anchored in evolutionary biology for teaching and popularizing microbiology to minimize this problem. To do so , I present several topics that interconnect evolution and microbiology and discuss how these topics could increase the general public 's understanding of the microbial world.
