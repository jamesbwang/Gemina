  Tea white scab ( TWS) is a major disease affecting tea trees in mid-elevation regions and often occurs during rainy seasons with low temperatures. This disease is caused by the fungal pathogen Phoma<pathogen> sp.. TWS can infect young stems , tender leaves , and tender shoots and lead to the production of low-quality tea. Owing to the absence of an effective control , TWS can result in substantial loss in tea production. In this study , we isolated and identified the pathogen from tea leaves infected by TWS and then evaluated in vitro the antifungal activity of Shenqinmycin , polyoxin , azoxystrobin , oligosaccharins , and tebuconazole against Phoma<pathogen> sp.. Our results indicated that Shenqinmycin can inhibit the growth of Phoma<pathogen> sp. mycelia , with the EC
