  The hypothalamus plays an important role in the regulation of sleep/wakefulness states. While the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus ( VLPO) plays a critical role in the initiation and maintenance of sleep , the lateral posterior part of the hypothalamus contains neuronal populations implicated in maintenance of arousal , including orexin-producing neurons ( orexin neurons) in the lateral hypothalamic area ( LHA) and histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus ( TMN). During a search for neurons that make direct synaptic contact with histidine decarboxylase-positive ( HDC +) , histaminergic neurons ( HDC neurons) in the TMN and orexin neurons in the LHA of male mice , we found that these arousal-related neurons are heavily innervated by GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area including the VLPO. We further characterized GABAergic neurons electrophysiologically in the VLPO ( GABA
