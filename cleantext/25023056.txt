  Diagnosing acute kidney injury quickly is imperative since it is known as an independent risk factor for mortality in burn patients. We evaluated the diagnostic power of creatinine , cystatin , serum and urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin at different time periods and observed the changes from baseline for each biomarker. This was a prospective observation study from January 2015 to February 2016. A total of 84 patients were enrolled consecutively. Serum creatinine , serum cystatin C , and serum and urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin were measured at admission , 7th , 14th , 21st , and 28th days after admission. All samples were collected until acute kidney injury developed. Acute kidney injury developed in 35 patients. The mean age was 49.6 years with a male predominance. The median urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was the lowest ( 11.6 ng/dL) at admission , and the highest at 85.5 ng/dL on day 7. Mean creatinine level was the highest ( 0.88 mg/dL) at admission and the median creatinine level was the lowest ( 0.56 mg/dL) on the 14th day. The area under the curve of creatinine levels was the highest with 0.857 during the 1st week. The area under the curve of urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was the highest with 0.803 during the 5th week. Within 1 week of acute kidney injury , creatinine level was the optimal biomarker for diagnosis while urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin showed better diagnostic performance following the 4- week period.
