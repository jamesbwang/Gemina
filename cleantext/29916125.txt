  Apelin , an essential mediator of homeostasis , is crucially involved in cardiovascular diseases , including ischemic stroke. However , the functional roles of apelin-17 in cerebral collateral circulation and ischemic stroke protection are unknown. Here , we investigated the association between plasma apelin-17 levels and collateral circulation in patients with ischemic stroke and examined the mechanism undergirding the effects of apelin-17 on cerebral artery contraction and ischemic stroke protection in an animal model. Plasma nitric oxide ( NO) , apelin-17 , and apelin-36 levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in ischemic stroke patients with good or poor collateral circulation and in healthy participants. Additionally , the effects of apelin-17 on rat basilar artery contractions ( in vitro) and cerebral ischemia ( in vivo) were determined using vessel tension measurements and nuclear magnetic resonance , respectively. Patients with good collateral circulation had significantly higher plasma apelin-17 and apelin-36 levels than both patients with poor collateral circulation and healthy participants and plasma NO levels significantly higher than those in healthy participants. In vitro , apelin-17 pretreatment markedly attenuated U46619-induced rat basilar artery contractions in an endothelium-dependent manner. Additionally , NO production or guanylyl cyclase inhibitors abolished the apelin-17 effect on U46619-induced vascular contraction. Intravenous pretreatment of rats with apelin-17 markedly reduced cerebral infarct volume at 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Plasma apelin-17 levels in ischemic stroke patients were positively associated with enhanced collateral circulation , which our animal study data suggested may have resulted from an apelin-17-induced cerebral artery dilation mediated through the NO-cGMP pathway.
