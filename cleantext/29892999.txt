  Delivery of chemotherapy in the surgical bed has shown preclinical activity to control cancer progression upon subtotal resection of pediatric solid tumors , but whether this new treatment is safe for tumor-adjacent healthy tissues remains unknown. Here , Wistar rats are used to study the anatomic and functional impact of electrospun nanofiber matrices eluting SN-38-a potent chemotherapeutic agent-on several body sites where pediatric tumors such as neuroblastoma , Ewing sarcoma<disease> , and rhabdomyosarcoma arise. Blank and SN-38-loaded matrices embracing the femoral neurovascular bundle or in direct contact with abdominal viscera ( liver , kidney , urinary bladder , intestine , and uterus) are placed. Foreign body tissue reaction to the implants is observed though no histologic damage in any tissue/organ. Skin healing is normal. Tissue reaction is similar for SN-38-loaded and blank matrices , with the exception of the hepatic capsule that is thicker for the former although within the limits consistent with mild foreign body reaction. Tissue and organ function is completely conserved after local treatments , as assessed by the rotarod test ( forelimb function) , hematologic tests ( liver and renal function) , and control of clinical signs. Overall , these findings support the clinical translation of SN-38-loaded nanofiber matrices to improve local control strategies of surgically resected tumors.
