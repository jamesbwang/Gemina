  Hibernation consists of torpor , with marked suppression of metabolism and physiological functions , alternated with arousal periods featuring their full restoration. The heart is particularly challenged , exemplified by its rate reduction from 400 to 5-10 beats per minute during torpor in Syrian hamsters. In addition , during arousals , the heart needs to accommodate the very rapid return to normal function , which lead to our hypothesis that cardiac function during hibernation is supported by maintenance of protein homeostasis through adaptations in the protein quality control ( PQC) system. Hereto , we examined autophagy , the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) unfolded protein ( UPR
