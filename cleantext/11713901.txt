  Aberrant expression of CCL5 has been found in several kinds of inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> , and the roles of CCL5 in these diseases have also been reported. However , the role of CCL5 in infantile pneumonia<disease> is still unclear. Thus , the function and acting mechanism of CCL5 in the Human fetal lung fibroblast WI-38 cells were subjected with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) to mimic an in vitro model of pneumonia<disease> CCL5 was silenced by transfection with CCL5-targeted siRNA , and then cell viability , apoptosis , and the expressions of apoptosis-associated factors were respectively assessed by CCK-8 assay , flow cytometry and Western blot. Besides , expressions of CCL5 and pro-inflammatory factors were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The secretions of pro-inflammatory factors were measured by ELISA. Finally , the expressions of main factors in JNK and NF-κB pathways were detected. LPS treatment suppressed cell viability , promoted cell apoptosis , and enhanced the secretion of IL-6 , MCP-1 , and TNF-α. Overexpression of CCL5 was found in LPS-treated cells. CCL5 silence protected WI-38 cells from LPS-induced inflammatory damage , with increasing cell viability , inhibiting cell apoptosis , and reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Besides , CCL5 silence inhibited LPS-induced activations of JNK and NF-κB pathways. Down-regulation of CCL5 could protect WI-38 cells from LPS-induced inflammatory damage via inactivating JNK and NF-κB pathways.
