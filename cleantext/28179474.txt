  The synthetic cathinone α-pyrrolidinopentiophenone ( α-PVP) has been associated with bizarre public behavior in users. Association of such behavior with extended binges of drug use motivates additional investigation , particularly since a prior study found that half of male rats experience a binge of exceptionally high intake , followed by sustained lower levels of self-administration during the acquisition of intravenous self-administration ( IVSA) of a related drug , 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone. The binge-like acquisition pattern is novel for rat IVSA; thus , the present study sought to determine if this effect generalizes to IVSA of α-PVP in female rats. Female Wistar rats were trained in IVSA of α-PVP ( 0.05 mg/kg/inf) in experimental chambers containing an activity wheel. Groups were trained with the wheels fixed ( No-Wheel group) , fixed for the initial 5 days of acquisition or free to move throughout acquisition ( Wheel group). The groups were next subjected to a wheel access switch and then all animals to dose-substitution ( 0.0125-0.3 mg/kg/inf) with the wheels alternately fixed and free to move. Approximately half of the rats initiated their IVSA pattern with a binge day of exceptionally high levels of drug intake , independent of wheel access condition. Wheel activity was much lower in the No-Wheel group in the wheel switch post-acquisition. Dose-effect curves were similar for wheel access training groups , for binge/no binge phenotypic subgroups and were not altered with wheel access during the dose-substitution. This confirms the high reinforcer effectiveness of α-PVP in female rats and the accompanying devaluation of wheel activity as a naturalistic reward.
