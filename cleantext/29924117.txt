  We demonstrate the utility of microgel core/shell structures conjugated to fibrin-specific peptides as fibrinolytic agents. Poly ( N-isopropylmethacrylamide) ( pNIPMAm) based microgels conjugated to the peptide GPRPFPAC ( GPRP) were observed to bring about fibrin clot erosion , merely through exploitation of the dynamic nature of the clots. These results suggest the potential utility of peptide-microgel hybrids in clot disruption and clotting modulation.
