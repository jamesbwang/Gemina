  Pharmaceuticals are chemical compounds which are used to preserve human and animal health. Once administered , these compounds are metabolized or can remain unaltered until excreted. Therefore , a mixture of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites enters municipal sewers and wastewater treatment plants where , depending on their polarity , water solubility , and persistence , they can not be completely removed or transformed during the treatment process , so that unaltered pharmaceuticals and/or their metabolites can enter surface water. As a result , in recent years concern has grown about trace concentrations and the risk they pose to ecosystems , considering the annual increase in pharmaceutical production and use at world level.This chapter reviews the frog embryo teratogenesis assay-Xenopus ( FETAX). Originally developed during the mid-1980s as a test for detecting the developmental toxicity of pure chemical products and complex mixtures in the laboratory , in recent years it has been used to evaluate the mechanisms of action , biotransformation , and detoxification of xenobiotics as well as in ecotoxicology studies using alternative species and in situ monitoring.
