  The aim of this paper was to determine how the size of the pitch affected technical and tactical actions of the goalkeeper when playing small-sided games. The participants were 13 male youth players , including 3 goalkeepers. Three different pitch sizes were used ( 62 x 44 m; 50 x 35 m; 32 x 23 m). On each pitch , the players played three matches of 8 minutes , with 5-minute breaks between matches. Numerous variables were recorded and examined: defensive and offensive technical and tactical actions , opponent 's shooting zone , length and zone of the offensive action , and goal zone where the shoot was directed. An ad hoc observational tool was used. A descriptive analysis was described. The Fisher 's exact test was used when the expected distribution was below 5 or included values below 1 %. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The results showed that the technical-tactical actions of the goalkeeper differed among pitch sizes. In defensive actions , when the pitch was larger , the 1-on-1 situations took precedence , whereas when the pitch was smaller , the proportion of blocks increased. In offensive actions , the goalkeepers did not show a wide variety of actions when the pitch was larger , but when the pitch was smaller , passes with a hand or foot increased. These results show that the size should be taken into account when planning and designing tasks.
