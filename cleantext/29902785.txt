  Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma ( DDC) accounts for a small proportion of chondrosarcomas. They demonstrate aggressive behaviour with a high rate of local recurrence and systemic progression resulting in poor long-term survival rates. Due to its relatively low incidence , previous studies have grouped different histiotypes together to achieve adequate study numbers for analysis. This retrospective study examines the clinical course and the role of chemotherapy in the subgroup of patients with DDC where osteosarcoma is the predominant dedifferentiated component. Between 2000-2010 , 21 patients were identified. The mean age at presentation was 64 years ( range 35-80 years). 12 patients were considered unfit for chemotherapy , whilst 2 patients declined chemotherapy. 5 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy , with less than 90 % necrosis<symptom> demonstrated in all these cases. 3 patients received post-operative chemotherapy. The median survival for the entire group was 9.5 months. In the 7 patients who received chemotherapy , the median survival was 17 months , and those who had chemotherapy had a greater median time to local recurrence. This study demonstrates that cytotoxic chemotherapy may be offered to appropriately selected patients.
