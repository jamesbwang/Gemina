  Dot plots are widely used to quickly compare sequence sets. They provide a synthetic similarity overview , highlighting repetitions , breaks and inversions. Different tools have been developed to easily generated genomic alignment dot plots , but they are often limited in the input sequence size. D-GENIES is a standalone and web application performing large genome alignments using minimap2 software package and generating interactive dot plots. It enables users to sort query sequences along the reference , zoom in the plot and download several image , alignment or sequence files. D-GENIES is an easy-to-install , open-source software package ( GPL) developed in Python and JavaScript. The source code is available at https://github.com/genotoul-bioinfo/dgenies and it can be tested at http://dgenies.toulouse.inra.fr/.
