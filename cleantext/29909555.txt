  Vaginal mesh surgery is subject of debate due to the impact of mesh-related complications on patient 's lives. Not all of these complications are symptomatic. Restoration of the anatomy and improvement of pelvic floor function as a result may counter the experienced discomfort related to adverse events. We hypothesized that health-related quality of life ( HR-QoL) is comparable in women after vaginal mesh surgery regardless of the presence or absence of a mesh-specific complication. This was a cross-sectional study of 128 women who had vaginal mesh surgery in a Dutch university hospital between 2007 and 2012. HR-QoL was measured in women with and without mesh complications using standardized QoL questionnaires Urogenital Distress Inventory-6 ( UDI-6) , Incontinence Impact Questionnaire ( IIQ) , Defecation Distress Inventory ( DDI) , and Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Function Questionnaire ( PISQ-12). Complications were scored according to the International Urogynecological Association ( IUGA) complication classification. Comparisons between groups were performed with Student 's t test and analysis of variance ( ANOVA) test. In 29 ( 23 %) women , a mesh-related complication occurred. The domain scores of the UDI-6 , DDI , IIQ , and PISQ showed no statistically significant differences between women with and without a mesh-related complication. A post hoc analysis showed similar HR-QoL for those in whom the complication had been resolved and those with persistent symptoms of the complication. Mesh surgery imposes specific complications. When counseling patients about the potential adverse events related to vaginal mesh surgery , it is important to inform them that mesh-related complications do not negatively affect QoL related to micturition , defecation , and sexual functioning.
