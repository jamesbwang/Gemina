  We describe a fluorescence imaging method to visualize the dynamics of the central vacuole in rice cells during invasion by the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae<pathogen>. This method utilizes the combination of confocal microscopy , rice sheath cells ( optically transparent) , fluorescently tagged M. oryzae<pathogen> ( red fluorescence) , and fluorescein diacetate staining ( green fluorescence; visualizing vacuole dynamics). Using this method , we demonstrate that the vacuole undergoes progressive shrinkage and collapse during M. oryzae<pathogen> infection.
