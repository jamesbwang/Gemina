  The development of T cell mediated immunity relies on the assembly of a highly specialized interface between T cell and antigen presenting cell ( APC) , known as the immunological synapse ( IS). IS assembly is triggered when the T cell receptor ( TCR) binds to specific peptide antigen presented in association to the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC) by the APC , and is followed by the spatiotemporal dynamic redistribution of TCR , integrins , co-stimulatory receptors and signaling molecules , allowing for the fine-tuning and integration of the signals that lead to T cell activation. The knowledge acquired to date about the mechanisms of IS assembly underscores this structure as a robust pharmacological target. The activity of molecules involved in IS assembly and function can be targeted by specific compounds to modulate the immune response in a number of disorders , including cancers and autoimmune diseases , or in transplanted patients. Here , we will review the state-of-the art of the current therapies which exploit the IS to modulate the immune response.
