  Recent studies have provided evidence for both a positive and a negative effect of orthography on second language speech learning. However , not much is known about whether orthography can trigger a McGurk-like effect ( McGurk & MacDonald , 1976) in second language speech learning. This study examined whether exposure to auditory and orthographic input may lead to a McGurk-like effect in naïve English-speaking participants learning a second language with Spanish phonology and orthography. Specifically , it reports on ( a) production of non-target-like combinations such as ( lj) as in ( poljo) for <pollo>- ( pojo) , where the auditory Spanish ( j) and the first language English ( l) that correspond to the shared digraph <ll> are integrated , and ( b) fusion quantified in terms of ( z) devoicing such as ( z̥apito) for <zapito>- ( zapito). Moreover , the effects of ( a) type of grapheme-to-sound correspondence , ( b) position in the word , and ( c) condition of training and testing were examined. Participants were assigned to four groups: ( a) auditory only , ( b) orthography at training and production , ( c) orthography at training , and ( d) orthography at production. The positions included word-initial and word-medial. The grapheme-to-sound correspondences consisted of <v>- ( b) , <d>- ( δ) , <z>- ( s) and <ll>- ( j). Results were indicative of a McGurk-like effect only for the Spanish digraph <ll>. The highest rate of combination productions was attested in the orthography-training condition in the word-medial position.
