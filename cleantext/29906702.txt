  Antibacterial activity is essential and highly demanded in worldwide to prevent potential bacterial infection. Here in this work , we report a new approch for the fabrication of flexible zinc oxide nanopillar arrays ( ZG-NPA) film with an efficient antibacterial activity. A flexible NPA film served as a substrate for the rapid formation of ZnO by using ultrasound-assisted method. The enhancement of antibacterial activity were induced by cellular damages because of nano topological effects and electrostatic interaction between bacteria and ZG-NPA. Owing to the benefits of combination with flexibility , high surface areas from nano-features and excellent antibacterial efficiency ( > 80 %) of ZG-NPA , the film can show great potential for use as novel biomaterials for preventing bacterial infections.
