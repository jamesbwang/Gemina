  Detection of faecal gluten immunogenic peptides ( GIP) is a biomarker of recent gluten consumption. GIP levels can be used to monitor gluten intake and compliment clinical methods to evaluate compliance to gluten free diet ( GFD). In this study , recent gluten intake was measured by GIP in CD children and compared to routine clinical measures to evaluate GFD compliance. GIP was measured in 90 samples from 63 CD children ( 44 previously and 19 newly diagnosed with follow-up samples at 6 and 12 months on GFD). Compliance to GFD was evaluated based on clinical assessment , tTG levels and Biagi score. GIP was detectable in 16 % of patients with previous CD diagnosis on GFD. BMI z-score ( p = 0.774) , height z-score ( p = 0.723) , haemoglobin concentration ( p = 0.233) , age ( p = 0.448) , gender ( p = 0.734) or disease duration ( p = 0.488) did not differ between those with detectable and non-detectable GIP. In newly diagnosed patients , on gluten containing diet , GIP was detectable in 95 % of them. Following GFD initiation , GIP decreased ( p < 0.001); 17 % and 27 % had detectable levels at 6 and 12 months , respectively. Compared to GIP , the Biagi score , tTG and clinical assessment presented sensitivity of 17 % , 42 % and 17 %. Likewise , GIP was detectable in 16 % , 16 % , 14 % of patients evaluated as GFD compliant according to the Biagi score , tTG and clinical assessment. A combination of methods did not improve identification of patients who were non-compliant. Inclusion of faecal GIP measurements is likely to improve identification of GFD recent non-compliance in CD management and could be incorporated into current follow-up strategies.This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 ( CCBY) , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original work is properly cited. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0.
