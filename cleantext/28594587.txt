  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) is a progressive disease and a composite endpoint could be an indicator of treatment effect on disease worsening. This post-hoc analysis assessed whether indacaterol/glycopyrronium ( IND/GLY) 110/50 μg once daily reduced the risk of clinically important deterioration ( CID) versus salmeterol/fluticasone ( SFC) 50/500 μg twice daily in moderate-to-very severe COPD patients from the FLAME study. CID was defined as ≥ 100 mL decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV IND/GLY significantly delayed the time to CID ( hazard ratio ( HR) ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI)) , 0.72 ( 0.67-0.78); P < 0.0001) , and reduced the incidences of CID versus SFC. Additionally , IND/GLY delayed the time to CID in all patient subgroups. After 12 weeks until 52 weeks , CID + patients had a significantly higher rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations versus CID- patients ( P < 0.0001); moreover , CID + patients experienced moderate-to-severe exacerbations significantly earlier versus CID- patients ( P < 0.0001). CID + patients had a comparable change in the SGRQ total score versus CID- patients. IND/GLY reduced the risk of CID versus SFC. CID had a significant impact on long-term exacerbation outcomes in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD and a history of ≥ 1 exacerbations in the previous year. Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01782326.
