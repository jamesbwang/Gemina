  To investigate the contamination condition of the aluminium in commercial foods in Shaanxi Province , and evaluate aluminium dietary intake level in Shaanxi population and its potential health risks. 1331 samples in Shaanxi Province were collected from 2013 to 2015. The aluminium contents were detected by National Food Contamination and Harmful Factors in Risk Monitoring Manual , and data of total diet study in Shaanxi Province in 2007 , to calculate dietary intake of aluminium in Shaanxi population. Average dietary intake of aluminium was 0. 358 mg/ ( kg Â· d) , accounted for 125 % of PTWI. The dietary intake of aluminium in children aged 2 to7 years old was highest , followed children aged 8 to 12 years old and men aged 13 to 19 years old. Grain products and potato products were the main sources of aluminium exposure compared with others. The dietary intake of aluminium in Shaanxi population is more than the PTWI. The children aged 2 to 7 years old , children aged 8 to12 years old and men aged 13 to 19 years old is high. Grain products and potato products are the main sources of aluminium exposure in Shaanxi population.
