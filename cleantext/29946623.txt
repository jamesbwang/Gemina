  Oligonucleotide-nanoparticle conjugates , also called programmable atom equivalents , carry promise as building blocks for self-assembled colloidal crystals , reconfigurable or stimuli responsive functional materials , as well as bio-inspired hierarchical architectures in wet environments. In situ studies of the DNA-mediated self-assembly of nanoparticles have so far been limited to reciprocal space techniques. Liquid-cell electron microscopy could enable imaging such systems with high resolution in their native environment but to realize this potential , radiation damage to the oligonucleotide linkages needs to be understood and conditions for damage-free electron microscopy identified. Here , we analyze in situ observations of DNA-linked two-dimensional nanoparticle arrays , along with control experiments for different oligonucleotide configurations , to identify the mechanisms of radiation damage for ordered superlattices of DNA-nanoparticle conjugates. In a biological context , the results point to new avenues for studying direct and indirect radiation effects for small ensembles of DNA in solution by tracking conjugated nanoparticles. By establishing low-dose conditions suitable for extended in situ imaging of programmable atom equivalents , our work paves the way for real-space observations of DNA-mediated self-assembly processes.
