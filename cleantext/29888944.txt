  Contrary to the popular belief that collaboration brings better problem solutions , empirical studies have revealed that interacting groups often performed worse than noninteracting `` nominal '' groups. Past studies mainly examined how overhearing others ' ideas impacts group performance. This study investigated the impact of another essential but overlooked group communicative process-verbalizing ideas to others-on group performance. Participants ( N = 156) solved 20 verbal puzzles either alone quietly , alone thinking-aloud , or in verbalizing pairs. Participants in the same working-alone condition were randomly paired to form nominal pairs and their pooled performance was treated as nominal group performance. Relative to the quiet nominal group , the performance of the thinking-aloud nominal and interacting groups were impaired to similar extents. These two groups also demonstrated a similar limited capacity to expand the search scope. The equivalency of the interacting and thinking-aloud nominal group results suggest that verbalization is a key factor in groups ' inferior performance. ( PsycINFO Database Record
