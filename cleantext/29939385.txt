  Diving is a popular recreation with an excellent safety record , with an estimated 1.8 deaths per 1 million dives. This study investigated the relationship between intentional deviation from accepted diving practices ( violations) and diver fatalities. The authors examined 119 incidents/122 diver fatalities that did not involve diver training in North<pathogen> America and the Caribbean , and identified the presence of violations of accepted diving safety practices , as well as if the death was associated with an acute medical event such as heart attack. Of the 122 fatalities , 57 % ( n = 70) were associated with a medical event and 43 % ( n = 52) were non-medical. Violations were found in 45 % of fatalities ( n = 55) overall. Violations were recorded for 23 % of the 70 medical and 75 % of the 52 non-medical fatalities. Divers who died from something other than a medical cause were 7 times as likely to have one or more violations associated with the fatality ( OR 7.3 , 95 % CI 2.3-23.2). The odds of dying from something other than a medical condition increased approximately 60 % for each additional 10 metres of depth. The odds of a death being associated with a medical condition increased approximately 9 % per year of age , or 2.4 times for every 10 years older a diver was. Medical events are associated with over half of the non-training related diver fatalities in North<pathogen> America and the Caribbean , with the odds of death being associated with a medical condition doubling each decade of additional age. These data support recommendations that divers stay physically fit and have regular medical checkups , particularly as they get older. They also strongly support the safety benefit of adhering to established safe diving practices.
