  Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma ( ChRCC) accounts for 5 % of all sporadic renal cancers and can also occur in genetic syndromes<disease> including Birt-Hogg-Dube ( BHD) and tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC). ChRCC has a distinct accumulation of abnormal mitochondria , accompanied by characteristic chromosomal imbalances and relatively few `` driver '' mutations. Metabolomic profiling of ChRCC and oncocytomas ( benign renal tumors that share pathological features with ChRCC) revealed both similarities and differences between these tumor types , with principal component analysis ( PCA) showing a distinct separation. ChRCC have a striking decrease in intermediates of the glutathione salvage pathway ( also known as the gamma-glutamyl cycle) compared with adjacent normal kidney , as well as significant changes in glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway intermediates. We also found that gamma glutamyl transferase 1 ( GGT1) , the key enzyme of the gamma-glutamyl cycle , is expressed at âˆ¼ 100-fold lower levels in ChRCC compared with normal kidney , while no change in GGT1 expression was found in clear cell RCC ( ccRCC). Significant differences in specific metabolite abundance were found in ChRCC vs. ccRCC , including the oxidative stress marker ophthalmate. Down-regulation of GGT1 enhanced the sensitivity to oxidative stress and treatment with buthionine sulfoximine ( BSO) , which was associated with changes in glutathione-pathway metabolites. These data indicate that impairment of the glutathione salvage pathway , associated with enhanced oxidative stress , may have key therapeutic implications for this rare tumor type for which there are currently no specific targeted therapies.
