  Cancer incidence substantially increases with ageing in both men and women , although the reason for this increase is unknown. In this Series paper , we propose that age-associated changes in gut commensal microbes , otherwise known as the microbiota , facilitate cancer development and growth by compromising immune fitness. Ageing is associated with a reduction in the beneficial commensal microbes , which control the expansion of pathogenic commensals and maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier through the production of mucus and lipid metabolites , such as short-chain fatty acids. Expansion of gut dysbiosis and leakage of microbial products contributes to the chronic proinflammatory state ( inflammaging) , which negatively affects the immune system and impairs the removal of mutant and senescent cells , thereby enabling tumour outgrowth. Studies in animal models and the importance of commensals in cancer immunotherapy suggest that this status can be reversible. Thus , interventions that alter the composition of the gut microbiota might reduce inflammaging and rejuvenate immune functions to provide anticancer benefits in frail elderly people.
