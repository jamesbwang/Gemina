  A 40-year-old woman presented to our stroke center for a left middle cerebral artery embolic occlusion. This was successfully treated with mechanical thrombectomy using a stent retriever and balloon guide catheter aspiration. The patient was discharged home in good condition on clopidogrel but returned 2 months later with a contralateral right middle cerebral artery embolic occlusion. This was also successfully treated , this time with a stent retriever and local aspiration ( Sol-Arc technique). She was once again discharged in good condition but with warfarin and an implanted loop recorder. This case demonstrates the feasibility of short-term bilateral mechanical thrombectomy for embolic middle cerebral artery occlusions.
