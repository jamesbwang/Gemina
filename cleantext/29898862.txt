  Wilson 's disease is characterized by the accumulation of copper in different organs , mainly affecting the liver , brain , and cornea , and is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. More than 120 polymorphisms in the ATP7B gene have been reported in the medical literature. The aim of the present study was to identify the conformational changes in the exon 3 region of the ATP7B gene and detect the p.L456V polymorphism in Cuban patients clinically diagnosed with Wilson 's disease. A descriptive study was conducted at the Centro Nacional de Genética Médica and the Instituto Nacional de Gastroenterología within the time frame of 2007-2012 and included 105 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Wilson 's disease. DNA extraction was performed through the salting-out method and the fragment of interest was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction technique. The conformational shift changes in the exon 3 region and the presence of the p.L456V polymorphism were identified through the Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism analysis. The so-called b and c conformational shift changes , corresponding to the p.L456V polymorphism in the heterozygous and homozygous states , respectively , were identified. The allelic frequency of the p.L456V polymorphism in the 105 Cuban patients that had a clinical diagnosis of Wilson 's disease was 41 % and liver-related symptoms were the most frequent in the patients with that polymorphism. The p.L456V polymorphism was identified in 64 Cuban patients clinically diagnosed with Wilson 's disease , making future molecular study through indirect methods possible.
