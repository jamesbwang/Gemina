  Obesity-related brain gray ( GM) and white matter ( WM) abnormalities have been reported in regions associated with food-intake control and cognitive-emotional regulation. Bariatric surgery ( BS) is the most effective way to treat obesity and induce structural recovery of GM/WM density and WM integrity. It is unknown whether the surgery can promote structural changes in cortical morphometry along with weight-loss. Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging and surface-based morphometry analysis were used to investigate BS-induced alterations of cortical morphometry in 22 obese participants who were tested before and one month post-BS , and in 21 obese controls ( Ctr) without surgery who were tested twice ( Baseline and One-month). Results showed that fasting plasma ghrelin , insulin , and leptin levels were significantly reduced post-BS ( P < 0.001). Post-BS there were significant decreases in cortical thickness in the precuneus ( P
