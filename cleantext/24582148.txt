  The goal of this research is the investigation of a way to maximize the production of docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA) and β-carotene by optimizing the culture conditions of their sources , microalgae Schizochytrium limacinum and fungus Blakeslea trispora respectively , in a fermentation medium. The influencing factors in the fermentation process for producing DHA and β-carotene have proven to be: the concentration of carbon source ( different glycerol crude and pure concentrations) for both of them , and in particular temperature for DHA and pH for β-carotene. Testing the effect of these parameters was determined: biomass , DHA and β-carotene concentration. The highest production by S. limacinum was obtained at 25 °C , while using a quantity of 90 g/L of glycerol ( crude or pure) as a carbon source. Temperature was the main factor that influenced the biosynthesis of DHA. The quantification of DHA was made by GC-MS chromatography , followed by a purification process , with the end result of DHA in pure phase. The maximum quantities for β-carotene production were obtained with pH 7 and 60 g/L of crude glycerol. The results highlight the possibility of using crude glycerol as a low-cost substrates for growth of microalgae S. limacinum and of fungus B. trispora in order to obtain the crucial molecules: docosahexaenoic acid and β-carotene.
