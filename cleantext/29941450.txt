  Most secretory proteins travel through a well-documented conventional secretion pathway involving the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER) and the Golgi complex. However , recently , it has been shown that a significant number of proteins reach the plasma membrane or extracellular space via unconventional routes. Unconventional protein secretion ( UPS) can be divided into two types: ( i) the extracellular secretion of cytosolic proteins that do not bear a signal peptide ( i.e. leaderless proteins) and ( ii) the cell-surface trafficking of signal-peptide-containing transmembrane proteins via a route that bypasses the Golgi. Understanding the UPS pathways is not only important for elucidating the mechanisms of intracellular trafficking pathways but also has important ramifications for human health , because many of the proteins that are unconventionally secreted by mammalian cells and microorganisms are associated with human<disease> diseases<disease> , ranging from common inflammatory<disease> diseases<disease> to the lethal genetic disease of cystic<disease> fibrosis<disease>. Therefore , it is timely and appropriate to summarize and analyze the mechanisms of UPS involvement in disease pathogenesis , as they may be of use for the development of new therapeutic approaches. In this Review , we discuss the intracellular trafficking pathways of UPS cargos , particularly those related to human<disease> diseases<disease>. We also outline the disease mechanisms and the therapeutic potentials of new strategies for treating UPS-associated diseases.
