  Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis<disease> ( NBTE) is a well-described phenomenon associated with malignancies due to hypercoaguable state. In the setting of pancreatic cancer , NBTE is more commonly diagnosed postmortem. We describe a case of a man who was diagnosed with pancreatic carcinoma after incidental finding of NBTE. Imaging incidentally revealed multiple strokes , bilateral renal and splenic infarcts , while subsequent workup for cardioembolic source demonstrated a 1.1 × 0.7 cm mitral valve vegetation. As multiple blood cultures were sterile and patient lacked clinical signs of infection , an underlying malignancy was suspected. CT abdomen demonstrated a dilated pancreatic duct , MRI showed a 2.8 × 2.2 cm pancreatic head mass. Endoscopic biopsy of the mass revealed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Other than NBTE , there were no other clinical or laboratory findings to clearly suggest pancreatic cancer. Thus , incidental discovery of this mitral valve vegetation led to the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy.
