  There is considerable interest in using macroencapsulation devices as a delivery strategy for transplanting insulin-producing cells. This review aims to summarize recent advances , to highlight remaining challenges , and to provide recommendations for the field. A variety of new device designs have been reported to improve biocompatibility and to provide protection for islet/beta cells from immune destruction while allowing continuous secretion of insulin. Some of these new approaches are in clinical trials , but more research is needed to determine how sufficient beta-cell mass can be transplanted in a clinically applicable device size , and that insulin is secreted with kinetics that will safely provide adequate controls of glucose levels. Macroencapsulation is a potential solution to transplant beta cells without immunosuppression in diabetes patients , but new strategies must be developed to show that this approach is feasible.
