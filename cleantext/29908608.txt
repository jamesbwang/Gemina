  A nanocrystalline-amorphous ( NC-A) mixed layer was obtained by ultrasonic shot peening ( USP) on pure titanium at room temperature and observed by X-ray diffraction pattern ( XRD) , scanning electron microscope ( SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope ( HRTEM). The results showed that the amorphization percentage in the NC-A mixed layer increased continuously with the increase of the peening duration , shot diameter and sonotrode amplitude or the decrease of the peening distance. The maximum amorphization percentage achieved in this study was 44.09 %. Moreover , with the amorphization percentage in the NC-A mixed layer increasing , the surface hardness increased constantly. Base on the experimental results , the amorphization mechanism during USP treatment was also analyzed.
