  Î²-ionone ( BIO) is used in fragrances , toiletries and non-cosmetic products , and as a flavor food additive. Notwithstanding the widespread human exposure , there are limited data on the reproductive toxicity of BIO. This study evaluated the developmental toxicity of BIO ( 0 , 125 , 250 , 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight/day) given orally to rats on days 6-15 of gestation ( GD6-15). C-section was on GD21 and implantations , living and dead fetuses and resorptions were recorded. Fetuses were weighed , and examined for external abnormalities and skeleton and visceral anomalies. The embryotoxicity of a single oral dose of BIO ( 1000 mg/kg body wt) given on GD11 was evaluated as well. At the highest dose , BIO reduced weight gain and produced chromodacryorrhea and other signs of toxicity. BIO did not increase the frequency of malformations nor did it retard fetal growth. Nonetheless , BIO decreased the pregnancy rate in the group of females exposed on GD6-15 , and increased the resorption rate in those treated on GD11 only. In conclusion , except for a higher embryolethality at a maternally toxic dose , BIO caused no embryotoxic effect over the dose range tested and the study NOAEL for maternal and developmental toxicity was 500 mg of BIO/ kg of body weight/day.
