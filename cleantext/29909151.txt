  Benign precursors of B lymphocytes , termed hematogones , are observed in the regenerative state of hematopoiesis following chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT). Previous studies have demonstrated that expansion of hematogones correlates with better clinical outcomes after allo-HSCT. We retrospectively analyzed the association between hematogones and clinical outcomes in 309 consecutive patients who underwent allo-HSCT , which is the largest population-based cohort reported so far. The incidence of hematogones was significantly higher in complete remission ( CR) patients at the time of transplantation than in non-CR patients , after myeloablative conditioning than after reduced-intensity conditioning , with tacrolimus-based graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD) prophylaxis than with cyclosporine-based prophylaxis , and with disease other than malignant lymphoma ( all P < .05). Patients with hematogones developed less acute GVHD and infections than did those without them ( P < .05). Emergence of hematogones was associated with superior GVHD-free relapse-free survival and lower nonrelapse mortality , and was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival , irrespective of donor sources.
