  Bridge inspection using unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAV) with high performance vision sensors has received considerable attention due to its safety and reliability. As bridges become obsolete , the number of bridges that need to be inspected increases , and they require much maintenance cost. Therefore , a bridge inspection method based on UAV with vision sensors is proposed as one of the promising strategies to maintain bridges. In this paper , a crack identification method by using a commercial UAV with a high resolution vision sensor is investigated in an aging concrete bridge. First , a point cloud-based background model is generated in the preliminary flight. Then , cracks on the structural surface are detected with the deep learning algorithm , and their thickness and length are calculated. In the deep learning method , region with convolutional neural networks ( R-CNN)- based transfer learning is applied. As a result , a new network for the 384 collected crack images of 256 & times; 256 pixel resolution is generated from the pre-trained network. A field test is conducted to verify the proposed approach , and the experimental results proved that the UAV-based bridge inspection is effective at identifying and quantifying the cracks on the structures.
