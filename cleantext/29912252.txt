  Enterobacteria resistant to quinolones is increasing worldwide , including Venezuela. The mechanism for this resistance could be due to genes included in the chromosome or in transmissible plasmids. To evaluate the resistance to quinolones , coded by qnr genes present in enterobacteria species , isolated in the University Hospital of Cumana , Venezuela. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests to quinolones , beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were carried out to all the isolates. The presence of qnr genes were determined by PCR. The isolates carrying the qnr genes were used for bacterial conjugation tests to determine the presence of transferable plasmids. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests and PCR were carried out in the transconjugants to verify the transfer of the genes. High levels of antimicrobial resistance to quinolones and beta-lactams were found among the isolates. We found that 33.6 % of the isolates carry the qnrB gene and 0.9 % qnr A gene. Of the 23 transconjugants , 20 showed to have qnrB gene , but none qnrA. We concluded that the high frequency of qnr genes found in the enterobacteria isolates and their presence on transferable plasmids , complicate the use of quinolones for the treatment of bacterial infections , thus , a treatment plan should be designed with the rational use and the rotation of different types of antimicrobials , in order to avoid the selection of increasingly resistant strains.
