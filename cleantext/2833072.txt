  Burr holes in craniotomy are not self-repairing bone defects. To regenerate new bone at the sites of these defects , a good scaffold is required. Biodegradable hybrids including silica or siloxane networks have been investigated as bone tissue scaffolds. This study examined skull bone regeneration using chitosan-siloxane hybrids after long-term implantation ( two and three years). After implantation of the hybrids , the surrounding cells migrated and formed fibrous tissues and blood vessels. Then , bone formation occurred from the surrounding blood vessels. Addition of calcium ions and coating with hydroxyapatite improved bone regeneration. Finally , the regenerated tissue area became smaller than the initial hole , and some areas changed to completed bone tissues.
