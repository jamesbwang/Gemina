  Breast cancer patients who require locoregional lymph node ( LLN) irradiation can be treated using a hybrid RapidArc technique combining 2 tangential and 3 RapidArc fields. Because the creation of hybrid RapidArc plans is complex and labor-intensive , we developed an automated treatment planning workflow using the scripting application programming interface of the Eclipse treatment planning system. Fifteen patients ( 5 right- and 10 left-sided) previously treated with breast + LLN radiation therapy were replanned using the script. The automated workflow included Average total planning times were 163 ± 97 and 33 ± 5 minutes for the manual and automated plans , respectively , with approximately 130 and 5 minutes of user interaction. Dosimetrically , both sets of plans were very similar , with comparable planning target volume dose homogeneity values and organ-at-risk mean dose differences of ≤ 1.9 Gy. In 14/15 patients , the physician judged that the automated plan was either preferred ( n = 4) or equal ( n = 10) to the manual plan. The complex hybrid RapidArc planning process for patients requiring breast + LLN irradiation was automated by optimizing the tangential field setup and integrating RapidPlan. The quality of the automated and manual plans was comparable , whereas automated planning times were substantially shorter. The principles described here could be used to automate other planning workflows.
