  Mn4 + doped phosphors , as an alternative to rare-earth element doped phosphors , have attracted immense attention owing to their ultrahigh quantum efficiency of red emission for potential applications in high rendering white LEDs ( light-emitting diodes). Their performance can be largely affected by quenching phenomena such as thermal quenching , concentration quenching and the quenching induced by some intrinsic/extrinsic defects. However , the quenching mechanisms due to the defect levels and host band are still incompletely understood. In this work , we carry out a comprehensive first-principles study on the underlying quenching mechanisms due to the defect levels of Mn4 + and other extrinsic/intrinsic defects , using the prototype oxide Y3Al5O12 ( YAG) , fluorides K2TiF6 ( KTF) and ZnTiF6 Â· 6H2O ( ZTF) as examples. From the comparison of the defect levels of Mn4 + with the host bands , we find that it is the very small energy difference between the defect levels of Mn4 + and the valence bands maximum ( VBM) of YAG that causes the lower luminescence thermal stability of YAG: Mn4 + , which we name as the hole-type thermal quenching mechanism. For the concentration quenching , it is nearly impossible for the Mn4 +- Mn4 + pairs , previously considered as the main quenching centers , to appear in phosphors. A new quenching nature has been discussed. For the impurity ionic effects , the hole-type defects can largely stabilize the Mn ions in +4 states , thereby enhancing the emission intensity. These proposed mechanisms can offer deeper insights into the luminescence behavior of Mn4 + and a better practical understanding of the high photoluminescence quantum yield red phosphors by adjusting their chemical components.
