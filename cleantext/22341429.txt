  In acute lymphoblastic leukemia<disease> ( ALL) , steroid resistance and hypovitaminosis D are both associated with a poor prognosis. We show that methylprednisolone , calcitriol and the AKT-inhibitor MK-2206 have a synergistic effect on the apoptosis of steroid resistant T-ALL cells. Compared to methylprednisolone monotherapy , calcitriol increases methylprednisolone induced apoptosis dose-dependently ( 1.37-1.92-fold; p < 0.05). Pre-incubation with calcitriol increases the apoptotic effect of MK-2206 even further ( 3.6-fold; p < 0.05). It also potentiates synergism between MK-2206 and methylprednisolone ( vehicle control 38 % vs. calcitriol 58 % , p < 0.01). The combination of calcitriol and AKT inhibition should be investigated further as treatment options for steroid resistance in T-ALL.
