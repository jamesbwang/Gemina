  The basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH) superfamily of transcription factors have been implicated in a wide range of cellular functions such as proliferation , differentiation , tumorigenesis , and circadian rhythms. In a previous siRNA-based screen , bHLH family member e41 ( BHLHE41) had been identified as a putative regulator of neuronal differentiation; however , its function remains largely elusive. To this end , using the CRISPR-Cas9 system , we established an isogenic Neuro2a ( N2a) cell line with biallelic targeting of Bhlhe41 gene ( Bhlhe41
