  Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency ( ASMD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder with heterogeneous clinical manifestations , including hepatosplenomegaly<symptom> and infiltrative pulmonary disease , and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Olipudase alfa ( recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase) is an enzyme replacement therapy under development for the non-neurological manifestations of ASMD. We present a quantitative systems pharmacology ( QSP) model supporting the clinical development of olipudase alfa. The model is multiscale and mechanistic , linking the enzymatic deficiency driving the disease to molecular-level , cellular-level , and organ-level effects. Model development was informed by natural history , and preclinical and clinical studies. By considering patient-specific pharmacokinetic ( PK) profiles and indicators of disease severity , the model describes pharmacodynamic ( PD) and clinical end points for individual patients. The ASMD QSP model provides a platform for quantitatively assessing systemic pharmacological effects in adult and pediatric patients , and explaining variability within and across these patient populations , thereby supporting the extrapolation of treatment response from adults to pediatrics.
