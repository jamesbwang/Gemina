  Purpose To validate ferumoxytol-based quantitative blood oxygenation level-dependent ( BOLD) MRI for mapping oxygenation of human infiltrative astrocytomas by using intraoperative measurement of tissue oxygen tension and histologic staining. Materials and Methods Fifteen patients with infiltrative astrocytomas were recruited into this prospective multicenter study between July 2014 and December 2016. Prior to treatment , participants underwent preoperative quantitative BOLD MRI with ferumoxytol to generate tissue oxygen saturation ( StO
