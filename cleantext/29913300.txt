  Species of the genus Pterocaulon ( Asteraceae) are used in different parts of the world for treating skin and liver diseases , as well as disorders of the respiratory system , among others. This review aims to discuss the present state of the art concerning the ethnobotanical uses , secondary metabolites and biological effects of Pterocaulon species and their chemical components. The available information on the genus Pterocaulon was gathered from scientific databases ( Web of Science , Pubmed , ScienceDirect , Scopus , ChemSpider , SciFinder ACS Publications , Wiley Online Library). Information was also obtained from local publications , M.Sc. and Ph.D. dissertations. All studies on the ethnobotany , phytochemistry , pharmacology and toxicology of the plants until December 2017 were included in this review. Approximately 40 coumarins and 30 flavonoids have been isolated from Pterocaulon species. Coumarins have been considered the chemotaxonomic markers in the genus and the most active components. Pharmacological studies carried out with extracts and isolated compounds revealed in vitro bioactivities that include antifungal , antiviral , and cytotoxicity. Most of the pharmacological investigations were not correlated with traditional uses of the plants. Pterocaulon species , a rich source of coumarins , have great ethnomedical potential. Nevertheless , further studies into the pharmacological activities are necessary since none of the purported effects of these plants was fully assessed. In-depth research regarding the toxicity are also required to ensure the safety of these medicinal plants.
