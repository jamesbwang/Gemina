  Ageing affects various physiological and metabolic processes in a body and a progressive accumulation of oxidative damage stands out as often used explanation. One of the most powerful scavenger of reactive oxygen species ( ROS) in all organs is melatonin. A majority of melatonin supplied to the body via blood originates from the pineal gland. However , we have been interested in a locally produced melatonin. We have used 2.5- and 36-months-old Wistar rats. Tissues were collected and gene expression of AA-NAT and ASMT , the two key enzymes in a synthesis of melatonin , was determined in brain , liver , kidney , heart , skin , and intestine. Since melatonin can influence antioxidant enzymes , the activity of superoxide dismutase ( SOD) and catalase ( CAT) , and the level of GSH were measured in liver. In addition , Copper ( Cu) , Zinc ( Zn) , and Manganese ( Mn) were also determined in liver since these microelements might affect the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The expression of AA-NAT and ASMT was increased in liver and skin of old animals. A positive correlation in AA-NAT and ASMT expression was observed in liver , intestine and kidney. Moreover , the activity of CAT enzyme in liver was increased while SOD activity was decreased. SOD and CAT were probably affected by the observed decreased amount of Cu , Zn , and Mn in liver of old animals. In our model , extrapineal melatonin pathway in ageing consisted of complex interplay of locally produced melatonin , activities of SOD and CAT , and adequate presence of Cu , Zn and Mn microelements in order to defend organs against oxidative damage.
