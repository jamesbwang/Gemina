  Refractory cutaneous warts<disease> are difficult to eliminate. In-situ photo-immunotherapy ( ISPI) is an innovative treatment concept combining local photothermal therapy ( PTT) and topical immunotherapy using imiquimod. To compare the efficacy of ISPI versus topical imiquimod alone , a prospective randomized controlled trial was performed with patients suffering from refractory cutaneous warts<disease>. In both groups , approximately 50 % of the skin surface containing warts<disease> was treated for 6 weeks. On the basis of topical imiquimod , ISPI includes an additional 808 nm laser irradiation. Treatment response , temperatures during irradiation and histopathologic examination were evaluated. The complete response rate in the ISPI-group ( 22/36 , 61.1 %) was significantly higher than in the imiquimod alone group ( 11/34 , 32.4 %). In the ISPI group , the mean maximum temperature was 44.5 ± 5.1 °C , and obvious lymphocytic infiltration was found in the perivasculature of the dermis. There was no recurrence or worsening in both groups during the 12-months follow-up. No obvious adverse reaction was observed. This study demonstrates that ISPI can be used as an effective and safe treatment modality for refractory cutaneous warts<disease>. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
