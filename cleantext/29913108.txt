  The aim of this study was to test the feasibility , acceptability and potential efficacy of a childcare-based intervention to reduce total and prolonged sitting time in pre-schoolers. Four centres and 115 pre-schoolers ( 44 % boys; 4.1 y) participated in a 3-month , 2-arm pilot cluster randomised controlled trial. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed through observations and semi-structured interviews. Sitting time , and breaks and bouts of sitting during childcare were assessed using an activPAL accelerometer over a one-week period at pre- and post-test ( 12wks). EF ( inhibition , working memory and shifting) was assessed using the Early Years Toolbox. Intervention fidelity was high for both intervention centres ( 77 % vs 70 %) and educators reacted positively to the intervention. Proportion of sitting time per day reduced significantly at post-test in both intervention ( -5.3 %/ day , ( 2.13 , 8.50)) and control centres ( -6.45 % , ( 4.20 , 8.71)) , resulting in a non- significant between-group difference ( p = 0.51 ( 2.4 , 4.9)). EF scores did not significantly differ between groups ( p > 0.05). Modifications to the childcare environment to reducing sitting , particularly the standing workstations , were feasible and acceptable to educators and children. No differences in sitting time between groups were seen; additional changes and longer-term trials are needed to reduce sitting time in pre-schoolers.
