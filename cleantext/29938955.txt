  With the aging of the society , the number of stroke patients has been increasing year by year. Compared with the traditional rehabilitation therapy , the application of upper limb rehabilitation robot has higher efficiency and better rehabilitation effect , and has become an important development direction in the field of rehabilitation. In view of the current development status and the deficiency of upper limb rehabilitation robot system , combined with the development trend of all kinds of products of the upper limb rehabilitation robot , this paper designed a center-driven upper limb rehabilitation training robot for cable transmission which can help the patients complete 6 degrees of freedom ( 3 are driven , 3 are underactuated) training. Combined the structure of robot with more joints rehabilitation training , the paper choosed a cubic polynomial trajectory planning method in the joint space planning to design two trajectories of eating and lifting arm. According to the trajectory equation , the movement trajectory of each joint of the robot was drawn in MATLAB. It laid a foundation for scientific and effective rehabilitation training. Finally , the experimental prototype is built , and the mechanical structure and design trajectories are verified.
