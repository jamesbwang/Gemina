  The development of mania during weaning is an underreported phenomenon that has received little attention in the recent past. Lack of timely diagnosis and effective management can negatively affect not only the mother but also her family. Main issue: I describe the case of a woman who experienced onset of mixed mania during weaning. At that time , she was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder , current episode manic , and a mixed-features specifier. The woman had a history of bipolar II disorder and a family history of postpartum depression<symptom> and bipolar disorder. I prescribed quetiapine 200 mg at bedtime , and symptoms resolved within a couple of days. The woman is still taking the prescribed dose and has not had any recurrences since. Weaning may act as a trigger for mixed mania , especially for women who have a history of bipolar disorder. Careful monitoring should occur during weaning for mothers with risk factors for bipolar disorder. Early recognition of symptoms and aggressive management is necessary to prevent hospitalization.
