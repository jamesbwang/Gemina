  This study investigated the incidence rate and features of vascular adverse events ( VAEs) in Japanese patients with chronic myeloid leukemia<disease> ( CML) who were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs). The analysis included 369 CML patients in the chronic or accelerated phases , selected from the CML Cooperative Study Group database; 25 events in 23 ( 6.2 %) of these patients were VAEs. At the time of VAE incidence , nine patients were on treatment with imatinib , 12 with nilotinib , three with dasatinib , and one with bosutinib. VAE incidence comprised 13 cases of ischemic heart disease ( IHD) , eight of cerebral infarction ( CI) , and four of peripheral arterial occlusive disease ( PAOD). IHD incidence rate in the study population was higher than that in the age-matched general population , particularly in nilotinib-treated patients , while CI incidence rate was almost equivalent. Compared with the Suita score , the SCORE chart and the Framingham score risk assessment tools detected more patients with high or very high risk of VAEs. In conclusion , incidence of IHD requires closer monitoring in nilotinib-treated patients. More detailed investigations for determining the most useful tool to predict VAE incidence and long-term analysis of therapy-related VAE cases are needed for improving safety during TKI therapy.
