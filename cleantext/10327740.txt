  Multilevel analysis which was primarily introduced to deal with hierarchical data was later applied extensively for research in other fields of science and not only for nested data , but also for repeated measurements or clustered trials. This method of statistical analysis was applied in dental studies in the 1991 for the first time but despite its value for data analysis in dental studies , its application for dental studies remains limited until now. This manuscript reviews the applications of this method in dental studies.
