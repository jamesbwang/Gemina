  Drug resistance is a principal contributor to the poor prognosis of ovarian cancer ( OC). Therefore , identifying factors that affect drug resistance in OC is critical. In the present study , 51 OC specimens from lab collections were immunohistochemically tested , public data for 489 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort and 1,656 samples from the Kaplan‑Meier Plotter were downloaded , and data were retrieved from Oncomine. It was identified that the mRNA and protein expression of the potassium calcium‑activated channel subfamily N member 3 ( KCNN3) was markedly lower in OC tissues compared with normal tissues , and in drug‑resistant OC tissues compared with sensitive OC tissues. Low KCNN3 expression consistently predicted shorter disease‑free and overall survival ( OS). Specifically , low KCNN3 expression predicted shorter OS in 395 patients with low expression levels of mucin‑16. There was additional evidence that KCNN3 expression is mediated by microRNA‑892b. Furthermore , text mining and analyses of protein and gene interactions indicated that KCNN3 affects drug resistance. To the best of the authors ' knowledge , this is the first report to associate KCNN3 with poor prognosis and drug resistance in OC. The present findings indicated that KCNN3 is a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for OC.
