  Information about Human<pathogen> Enterovirus<pathogen> circulation in Uruguay is scarce. The aim of this study was to generate the first description about their circulation in the country through the study of sewage samples collected before and after the switch from Oral Poliovirus<pathogen> Vaccine to Inactivated Poliovirus<pathogen> Vaccine. Viruses were concentrated by an adsorption-elution to a negatively charged membrane , and real-time quantitative PCR and qualitative PCR methods were used to detect , quantify , and characterize enteroviruses. Positive samples were inoculated in RD cells and two passages were performed. Additionally , RD + samples were subsequently passed onto L20B cells. Human Enteroviruses were detected in 67.6 % of the samples , with concentrations between 4.9 and 6.6 Log
