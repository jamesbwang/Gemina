  The aim of this study was to conduct a randomized clinical trial to assess the effects of 16 weeks of combined training on body composition , lipid profile , adiponectin , C-reactive protein ( CRP) , and leptin levels in people living with HIV/AIDS ( PLWHA). Fifty-eight HIV-infected individuals were randomized into a training group ( T) or a control group ( C). Combined training consisted of aerobic and resistance exercises performed at the same training session , applied at a frequency of three times a week for a total of 16 weeks. Waist circumference , body mass , body fat percentage ( t) , fat mass , lipid profile , adiponectin , CRP , and leptin levels were measured pre- and post-training in both groups. Sixteen weeks of combined training decreased ( P < 0.05) body fat in different body segments in PLWHA. Lipodystrophic PLWHA experienced greater reduction in body fat in the android region than non-lipodystrophic PLWHA after combined training. Lipid profile and circulating levels of adiponectin , leptin , and CRP remained unchanged. Sixteen weeks of combined training was effective to reduce body fat in different body segments , without altering plasma lipid and cytokine levels.
