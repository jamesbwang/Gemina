  To assess whether nursing home ( NH) residents with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2D) preferentially received `` T2D-friendly '' ( vs `` T2D-unfriendly '') β-blockers after acute myocardial infarction ( AMI) , and to evaluate the comparative effects of the two groups of β-blockers. This new-user retrospective cohort study of NH residents with AMI from May 2007 to March 2010 used national data from the Minimum Data Set and Medicare system. T2D-friendly β-blockers were those hypothesized to increase peripheral glucose uptake through vasodilation: carvedilol , nebivolol and labetalol. Primary outcomes were hospitalizations for hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia in the 90 days after AMI. Secondary outcomes were functional decline , death , all-cause re-hospitalization and fracture hospitalization. We compared outcomes using binomial and multinomial logistic regression models after propensity score matching. Of 2855 NH residents with T2D , 29 % initiated a T2D-friendly β-blocker vs 24 % of 6098 without T2D ( P < 0.001). For primary outcomes among residents with T2D , T2D-friendly vs T2D-unfriendly β-blockers were associated with a reduction in hospitalized hyperglycaemia ( odds ratio ( OR) 0.45 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI) 0.21-0.97) , but unassociated with hypoglycaemia ( OR 2.05 , 95 % CI 0.82-5.10). For secondary outcomes , T2D-friendly β-blockers were associated with a greater rate of re-hospitalization ( OR 1.26 , 95 % CI 1.01-1.57) , but not death ( OR 1.06 , 95 % CI 0.85-1.32) , functional decline ( OR 0.91 , 95 % CI 0.70-1.19) , or fracture ( OR 1.69 , 95 % CI 0.40-7.08). In older NH residents with T2D , T2D-friendly β-blocker use was associated with a lower rate of hospitalization for hyperglycaemia , but a higher rate of all-cause re-hospitalization.
