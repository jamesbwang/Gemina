  Parent-child relationships change during adolescence. Furthermore , parents and adolescents perceive parenting differently. We examined the changes in perceptions of parental practices in fathers , mothers , and adolescents during adolescence. Furthermore , we investigated if fathers ' , mothers ' , and adolescents ' perceptions converge during adolescence. Following 497 families across six waves ( ages 13-18) , we investigated the development of parental support and behavioral control using mother and father self-reports , and adolescent reports for mothers and fathers. We found curvilinear decrease for support and control. Parent-adolescent convergence emerged over the 6 years: those with higher intercepts had a steeper decrease , whereas correlations among parent and adolescent reports increased. This multi-informant study sheds light on the development of parent-adolescent convergence on perceptions of parenting.
