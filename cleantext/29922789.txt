  The synthesis of three new cyclometallated platinum ( ii) compounds containing a para-tolyl ligand and a tridentate ( C , N , N ') ( cm1) or a bidentate ( C , N) ligand and an additional ligand such as SEt2 ( cm2) or PPh3 ( cm3) is reported. The X-ray molecular structure of platinum ( ii) compound cm3 is also presented. Intermolecular oxidative addition of methyl iodide or iodine upon cm1 , cm2 and cm3 produced six novel cyclometallated platinum ( iv) compounds. The cytotoxic activity against a panel of human adenocarcinoma cell lines ( A-549 lung , MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast , and HCT-116 colon) , DNA interaction , topoisomerase I , IIα , and cathepsin B inhibition , and cell cycle arrest , apoptosis and ROS generation of the investigated complexes are presented. The best results for antiproliferative activity were obtained for platinum ( iv) compounds cm1MeI and cm1I2 arising from oxidative addition of methyl iodide and iodine , respectively , to cm1. Cyclometallated platinum ( iv) compounds cm1MeI and cm3MeI induce significant changes in the mobility of DNA and , in addition , cm1MeI , cm3MeI and cm1I2 , showed considerable topoisomerase IIα inhibitory activity. Moreover , the compounds exhibiting the higher antiproliferative activity ( cm1MeI and cm1I2) were found to generate ROS and to supress HCT-116 colon cancer cell growth by a mixture of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. 1H NMR experiments carried out in a buffered aqueous medium ( pH 7.40) indicate that compound cm1MeI is not reduced by common biologically relevant reducing agents such as ascorbic acid , glutathione or cysteine.
