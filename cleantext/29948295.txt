  For effective implantation of carmustine ( BCNU) wafers , it is important to determine the order of priority with reference to the intraoperative frozen section diagnosis of the resection margin ( IOFM). The accuracy of IOFM and patterns of tumor recurrence with implantation of BCNU wafers were studied retrospectively. Forty-six cases of newly diagnosed malignant glioma were evaluated. Tumors were resected after intraoperative frozen section diagnosis ( IOFD). IOFM was performed for resection walls and evaluated on a three-level scale (- , no tumor invasion; 1 + , minor cell invasion; 2 + , evident cell invasion). The results were used for effective BCNU wafer implantation. The IOFM sections were then thawed , frozen-paraffin marginal ( FPM) sections were prepared , and IOFM was evaluated with FPM sections. The accuracy of IOFD grading was compared to that of the formalin fixed paraffin-embedded section and was 76.1 %. The accuracy of IOFM was compared with the FPM section in 148 specimens from 42 patients. The IOFM accuracy was 80.4 %. BCNU wafers were implanted in 25 patients and there was recurrence in 15. Local recurrence was seen in 40 % ( 6 patients). However , there was no recurrence immediately below the BCNU wafers. With properly performed IOFM , BCNU wafers can be efficiently implanted , and local recurrence immediately below the BCNU wafers can be inhibited.
