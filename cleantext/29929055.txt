  This study aimed to examine the sleep-dependent memory consolidation of verbal declarative memory in Chinese adolescents in a naturalistic experimental setting. Thirty-nine healthy boarding school students ( ages 15-18 , 70 % female) were randomized to either a one-hour afternoon nap or wake group between the baseline and the retest sessions of three verbal declarative memory tasks: a Prose Stories Recall task , a Word Pair Associates task , and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Results showed that the nap group performed better than the no-nap group on both the Prose Stories Recall task and the Word Pair Associates task , but not on list learning. Our findings suggest that napping is beneficial to verbal declarative memory in adolescents , providing ecologically-valid empirical support for the sleep-dependent memory consolidation hypothesis using a napping paradigm in participants ' naturalistic habitat. Our results demonstrate the potential importance of napping as a practical mnemonic intervention/compensatory strategy for student populations.
