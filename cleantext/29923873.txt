  To study musculoskeletal workload in experienced surgeons during laparoscopic surgery ( LS) compared with robotic assisted laparoscopy ( RALS). 70-90 % of surgeons who regularly perform LS report musculoskeletal symptoms , mainly in neck and shoulders. Data regarding the potential ergonomic benefits of RALS in a clinical setting is very limited. Twelve surgeons with advanced experience in both LS and RALS each performed 2 hysterectomies on the same day. LS was performed standing , RALS sitting , the latter allowing forearm and head support. Bipolar surface electromyogram ( EMG) was recorded from several muscles and was expressed relative to EMG during maximum contractions ( % EMGmax). Gaps per minute plus static ( p0 .1) , mean ( p0 .5) , and peak ( p0 .9) muscle activation were calculated. Perceived exertion was rated before and just after each surgery. Neck<symptom> muscle activity ( p0 .1 4.7 vs. 3.0 % EMGmax , p0 .5 7.4 vs. 5.3 % EMGmax , p0 .9 11.6 vs. 8.2 % EMGmax , all P < 0.05) and static shoulder muscle activity ( p0 .1 5.7 vs. 2.8 % EMGmax , P < 0.05) were higher for LS than for RALS. Both a higher level of gaps during RALS and a lower rating of perceived exertion , also for the legs , after RALS supported these observations. However , low back muscle activity was higher for RALS. RALS is significantly less physically demanding than LS , and also feels less strenuous for the surgeons. However , for both types of surgeries , there still is room for improvement of working conditions. To further optimize these , we suggest a scheme to regularly observe and advise the surgeons.
