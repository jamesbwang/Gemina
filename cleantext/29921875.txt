  An intact and dynamic microtubule cytoskeleton is crucial for the development , differentiation , and maintenance of the mammalian cortex. Variants in a host of structural microtubulin-associated proteins have been identified to cause a wide spectrum of malformations of cortical development and alterations of microtubule dynamics have been recognized to cause or contribute to progressive neurodegenerative disorders. TBCD is one of the five tubulin-specific chaperones and is required for reversible assembly of the α-/ β-tubulin heterodimer. Recently , variants in TBCD , and one other tubulin-specific chaperone , TBCE , have been identified in patients with distinct progressive encephalopathy with a seemingly broad clinical spectrum. Here , we report the clinical , neuroradiological , and neuropathological features in eight patients originating from the Faroe Islands , who presented with an early onset , progressive encephalopathy with features of primary neurodegeneration , and a homogenous clinical course. These patients were homozygous for a TBCD missense variant c. ( 3099C > G); p. ( Asn1033Lys) , which we show has a high carrier frequency in the Faroese population ( 2.6 %). The patients had similar age of onset as the previously reported patients ( n = 24) , but much shorter survival , which could be caused by either differences in supportive treatment , or alternatively , that shorter survival is intrinsic to the Faroese phenotype. We present a detailed description of the neuropathology and MR imaging characteristics of a subset of these patients , adding insight into the phenotype of TBCD-related encephalopathy. The finding of a Faroese founder variant will allow targeted genetic diagnostics in patients of Faroese descent as well as improved genetic counseling and testing of at-risk couples.
