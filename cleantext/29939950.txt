J Strength Cond Res 32 ( 7): 2055-2060 , 2018-Among the different factors affecting the outcome of elite rowing competitions , pacing strategy plays a relevant role. The purpose of this study was to analyze the race profiles of youth athletes competing at the 2014 Youth Olympic Games over a distance of 1,000 m. According to the competition outcome of sculling and sweep events , 96 youth ( 17-18 years) rowers ( 48 male and 48 female) were divided into winner ( W) , not winner ( NW) , qualified ( Q) , and not-qualified ( NQ) athletes. The time during the 1,000-m race distance was considered at 0-500 m ( T1) and 500-1000 m ( T2). The average speed of T1 and T2 were normalized in relation to the average speed of the whole race. In both sexes , W rowers showed higher ( p > 0.05) T2 values ( 100.8 ± 0.9 %) with respect to T1 ( 99.2 ± 0.9 %) ones. Female athletes showed a higher ( p ≤ 0.05) T1 with respect to T2 in NW , Q , and NQ , whereas male athletes exhibited a higher T1 ( p ≤ 0.05) than T2 speed only in NQ. While to be admitted to the final phase of the competition , the rowers tended to favor a positive race strategy ( 88 %); during the final phase , a difference ( p = 0.43) emerged for outcome , with the majority of medalists ( 67 %) adopting a negative race strategy. These results suggest that winners have applied a different race strategy compared with the other groups in consequence to a higher efficiency of anaerobic metabolism.
