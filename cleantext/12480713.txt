  Immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia<symptom> ( HIT) is the clinically most important adverse drug reaction ( ADR) in response to heparin therapy characterized by a prothrombotic state despite a decrease in platelet count. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 96 suspected HIT cases and 96 controls to explore the genetic predisposition for HIT within a case-control pharmacovigilance study followed by replication in additional 86 cases and 86 controls from the same study. One single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP , rs1433265 , P = 6.5 Ã— 10 We identified and validated a HIT-associated locus on chromosome 5. Targeted NGS analysis for rare variants identifies DDR1 and MCTP2 as novel candidates. In addition , missense variants for ADAMTS16 and ICE1 were identified in the locus.
