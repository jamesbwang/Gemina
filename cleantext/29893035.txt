  The growth hormone ( GH) and growth insulin-like factor-1 ( IGF-1) act directly upon the regulation and growth in the different phases of preantral follicles. Thus , it is necessary to define their sequentiality until the in vitro preovulatory development. Therefore , the study aimed to assess the effects of a sequential medium containing GH and/or IGF-1 in the long-duration in vitro culture of preantral ovarian follicles. Ovarian fragments were cultivated: first half ( days 1-7) , second half ( days 7-14) or during 14 culture days. Treatments were identified as: αMEM +; GH → IGF-1; IGF-1 → GH and GH + IGF-1. The culture was designed in 24-well plates , in an incubator at 37 °C and 5 % CO
