  Cutaneous field cancerization arises due to UV-induced carcinogenesis of a `` field '' of subclinically transformed skin and actinic keratoses ( AKs) with a tendency to progress and recur. Commonly used treatment methods for multiple AKs include imiquimod , fluorouracil , ingenol mebutate , and photodynamic therapy; however , new options in field-directed therapy with superior efficacy , cosmesis , and convenience may appeal to patients. Ablative and nonablative lasers may fulfill these advantages and have been investigated as monotherapies and combination therapies for field cancerization. In this article , a review of the literature on various laser modalities with a focus on efficacy is provided.
