  Interleukin-32 ( IL-32) , a novel proinflammatory cytokine , is highly expressed in various cancer tissues and in established cancer cell lines. IL-32 has been revealed to serve a crucial role in human cancer development , including tumour initiation , proliferation and maintenance. The expression of IL-32 is regulated by numerous factors , including genetic variations , hypoxia and acidosis in the tumour microenvironment. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of IL-32 expression and its function are critical for the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies that target IL-32. This is a review of the current literature on the regulation and function of IL-32 in cancer progression , focusing on the molecular pathways linking IL-32 and tumour development.
