  We performed a systematic review of the literature regarding the diagnosis and treatment of calyceal diverticulum ( CD). The search strategy was conducted according to the Cochrane reviews guidelines for systematic reviews and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA) checklist. In total 1189 titles and abstracts were reviewed , of which 101 were selected for manuscript evaluation. Of these 101 papers , 40 were selected for inclusion after full manuscript evaluations. In the extracted papers , intravenous urography ( IVU) rather than CT urography was the main imaging tool for diagnosis , although many papers had failed to provide any imaging modality information. Extracted papers involved 88 , 153 and 487 patients who underwent shock<symptom> wave lithotripsy ( SWL) , flexible ureteroscopy/retrograde intrarenal surgery ( fURS/ RIRS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL) , respectively. Stone free rate were 21.3 % ( SWL) , 61.4 % ( fURS/RIRS) and 83.0 % ( PCNL). The complication rates were 8.0 % ( SWL) , 3.3 % ( fURS/RIRS) and 11.9 % ( PCNL). There was incomplete and inconsistent reporting of even basic clinical parameters such as the size and location of the CD , number of stones , outcomes , and complications. There was a striking lack of follow-up data , despite a known high recurrence rate. The literature on laparoscopic management was too sparse to analyze. This meta-analysis revealed there are not enough high-quality studies to evaluate the ideal strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of CDs. This systematic review emphasizes a) the importance of contrast imaging for CD diagnosis , b) higher success rates but also higher complication rates in PCNL than SWL and FURS and c) the need for standardized reporting of outcomes to include complications , need for further intervention , symptom resolution , stone clearance and CD ablation.
