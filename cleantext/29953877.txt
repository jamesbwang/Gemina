  Nonmuscle myosin-IIA ( NMHC-IIA) heavy chain phosphorylation has gained recognition as an important feature of myosin-II regulation. In previous work , we showed that phosphorylation on S1943 promotes myosin-IIA filament disassembly in vitro and enhances EGF-stimulated lamellipod extension of breast tumor cells. However , the contribution of NMHC-IIA S1943 phosphorylation to the modulation of invasive cellular behavior and metastasis has not been examined. Stable expression of phosphomimetic ( S1943E) or non-phosphorylatable ( S1943A) NMHC-IIA in breast cancer cells revealed that S1943 phosphorylation enhances invadopodia function , and is critical for matrix degradation in vitro and experimental metastasis in vivo. These studies demonstrate a novel link between NMHC-IIA S1943 phosphorylation , the regulation of extracellular matrix degradation and tumor cell invasion and metastasis.
