  Heparin therapy and prophylaxis may be accompanied by bleeding and thrombotic complications due to individual responses to treatment. Dosage control based on standard laboratory assays poorly reflects the effect of the therapy. The aim of our work was to compare the heparin sensitivity of new thrombodynamics ( TD) assay with sensitivity of other standard and global coagulation tests available to date. A total of 296 patients with high risk of venous thromboembolism ( deep vein thrombosis ( DVT) , early postoperative period , hemoblastosis) were enrolled in the study. We used a case-crossover design to evaluate the sensitivity of new thrombodynamics assay ( TD) to the hemostatic state before and after unfractionated heparin ( UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin ( LMWH) therapy/prophylaxis and to compare it with the activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT) , anti-Xa activity test , thrombin generation test ( TGT) and thromboelastography ( TEG). A receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate changes before and after heparin prophylaxis and therapy. Blood was sampled before heparin injection , at the time of maximal blood heparin concentration and before the next injection. Hypercoagulation before the start of heparin treatment was detected by TD , TGT and TEG but not by APTT. The area under the ROC curve ( AUC) was maximal for TD and anti-Xa , intermediate for TGT and TEG and minimal for APTT. These results indicate that TD has a high sensitivity to the effects of UFH and LMWH after both prophylactic and therapeutic regimes and may be used for heparin monitoring.
