  Patients with coronary heart disease ( CHD) who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) have a certain risk of vascular complications , including coronary restenosis and thrombosis. Many recent randomized controlled trials have reported that Danshen injection ( DSI) combined with conventional Western medicine can significantly reduce the occurrence of major cardiovascular adverse events in patients with CHD after PCI. However , there are many types of DSIs , and no study has yet compared each type. Therefore , we propose a study protocol for the systematic evaluation of the efficacy of various DSIs in the treatment of CHD after PCI. We will search the following electronic databases for randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of DSI in patients with CHD after PCI: PubMed , Embase , Web of Science , Cochrane Library , Scopus , Ovid Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews , China National Knowledge Infrastructure , and Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database. Each database will be searched from inception to April 2018. The entire process will include study selection , data extraction , risk of bias assessment , pairwise meta-analyses , and network meta-analyses. This proposed study will compare the efficacy of different DSIs in the treatment of patients with CHD after PCI. The outcomes will include major cardiovascular adverse events and left ventricular ejection fraction. This proposed systematic review will evaluate the different advantages of various types of DSIs in the treatment of patients with CHD after PCI. PROSPERO ( registration number: CRD42018092705).
