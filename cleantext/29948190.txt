  Animal models of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD) can be used to determine the progressive neurodegeneration characteristics of AD in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). Given the need for therapeutic interventions before the onset of frank AD , it is critical to examine if AD models demonstrate neuroanatomical remodeling in an equivalent preclinical phase. This manuscript examines the trajectories of brain and behavioural changes in the Triple transgenic mouse model ( 3xTg) prior to the development of AD-like behaviours. The 3xTg mimics both Î²-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles through three mutations associated with familial AD , namely: PS1
