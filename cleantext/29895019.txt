  Basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF) and nerve growth factor ( NGF) are essential for proper development , survival , growth , and maintenance of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. However , because bFGF and NGF have short half-life and rapid diffusion rate , they have limited clinical efficacy. Thus , there is an urgent need to develop an effective delivery system to protect bFGF and NGF from proteolysis while maintaining their normal bioactivities. To more efficiently deliver bFGF and NGF , we used a coacervate ( synthesized with heparin and a biodegradable polycation at mass ratio of 500: 100). The maximal package loads of GFs in coacervate were determined by Western Blotting; release efficiency of bFGF and NGF was measured by ELISA. Additionally , we evaluated the effect of bFGF and NGF on the viability , survival , and proliferation of neurons by MTT assay , BrdU cell proliferation , and calcein staining. Our coacervate incorporated bFGF and NGF and continuously released them for at least three weeks. This enhanced the growth and proliferation of PC12 cells and SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover , co-delivery of bFGF and NGF using coacervate was more neuroprotective than free application of both factors or coacervate delivery of each GF separately. Dual delivery of bFGF and NGF binding coacervate was neuroprotective via stimulating the growth and proliferation of neurons.
