  Epithelial cells form tissues with many functions , including secretion and environmental separation and protection. Glandular epithelial tissues comprise of cysts<symptom> and tubules that are formed from a polarized , single-epithelial cell layer surrounding a central , fluid-filled lumen. The pathways regulating key processes in epithelial tissue morphogenesis such as mitotic spindle formation are incompletely understood , but are important to investigate , as their dysregulation is a signature of epithelial tumors. Here , we describe a signaling axis that manifests in a defect in mitotic spindle orientation during epithelial growth and cystogenesis. We found that activation of the small GTPase ADP ribosylation factor 6 ( ARF6) results in the sustained internalization of cell-surface components such as the cMet receptor and the cell-adhesion molecule E-cadherin. The spindle orientation defect arising from elevated levels of ARF6-GTP required an increase in cMet endocytosis , but was independent of E-cadherin internalization or elevated extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK) activity resulting from internalized receptor signaling on endosomes. Misorientation of the mitotic spindle resulted in the development of epithelial cysts<symptom> with structural abnormalities , the most conspicuous of which was the presence of multiple intercellular lumens. Abnormal mitotic spindle orientation was necessary but insufficient to disrupt glandular development , as blocking the strong pro-survival signal resulting from ERK hyperactivation yielded structurally normal cysts<symptom> despite continued manifestation of spindle orientation defects. Our findings highlight a previously unknown link between ARF6 activation , cMet receptor internalization , and mitotic spindle orientation during epithelial glandular morphogenesis.
