  To determine frequency of dysphagia<symptom> risk and associated factors in hospitalized patients as well as to evaluate nutritional status by using different methods and correlate the status with scores of the Eating Assessment Tool ( EAT-10). This was a cross-sectional study including 909 inpatients of a philanthropic hospital. For the diagnosis of dysphagia<symptom> we used an adapted and validated Brazilian version of the Eating Assessment Tool ( EAT-10). The nutritional status was evaluated through the subjective global assessment , and anthropometric measurements included weight , calf and arm circumference , and knee height. The Mann-Whitney test , associations using the Pearson 's Ï‡2 and Spearman 's correlation were used to verify differences between the groups. The prevalence of dysphagia<symptom> risk was 10.5 % , and aging was the associated factor with this condition. Patients at risk presented lower values of arm and calf circumference , variables that correlated inversely with the Eating Assessment Tool ( EAT-10) score. Malnutrition was observed in 13.2 % of patients based on the subjective global assessment and in 15.2 % based on the Body Mass Index. Screening for dysphagia<symptom> and malnutrition should be introduced in hospitals routine to avoid or minimize damages caused by dysphagia<symptom> or malnutrition , especially among older people.
