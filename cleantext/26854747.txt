  Stimulation of cells with TNFα can promote distinct cell death pathways , including RIPK1-independent apoptosis , necroptosis , and RIPK1-dependent apoptosis ( RDA)- the latter of which we still know little about. Here we show that RDA involves the rapid formation of a distinct detergent-insoluble , highly ubiquitinated , and activated RIPK1 pool , termed `` iuRIPK1. '' iuRIPK1 forms after RIPK1 activation in TNF-receptor-associated complex I , and before cytosolic complex II formation and caspase activation. To identify regulators of iuRIPK1 formation and RIPK1 activation in RDA , we conducted a targeted siRNA screen of 1,288 genes. We found that NEK1 , whose loss-of-function mutations have been identified in 3 % of ALS patients , binds to activated RIPK1 and restricts RDA by negatively regulating formation of iuRIPK1 , while LRRK2 , a kinase implicated in Parkinson 's disease , promotes RIPK1 activation and association with complex I in RDA. Further , the E3 ligases APC11 and c-Cbl promote RDA , and c-Cbl is recruited to complex I in RDA , where it promotes prodeath K63-ubiquitination of RIPK1 to lead to iuRIPK1 formation. Finally , we show that two different modes of necroptosis induction by TNFα exist which are differentially regulated by iuRIPK1 formation. Overall , this work reveals a distinct mechanism of RIPK1 activation that mediates the signaling mechanism of RDA as well as a type of necroptosis.
