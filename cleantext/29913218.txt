  Size and morphology distributions are critical to the performance of nano-drug systems , as they determine drug pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Therefore , comprehensive and reliable analyses of these properties are required by both the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) and European Medicines Agency ( EMA). In this study , we compare two most commonly used approaches for assessing the size distribution and morphology of liposomal nano-drug systems , namely , dynamic light scattering ( DLS) and cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy ( cryo-TEM); an automated quantitative analysis method was developed for the latter method. We demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of each of these two approaches for a commercial formulation of the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin- Doxil Â® , in which the drug is encapsulated , mostly in the form of nano-rod crystals. With increasing drug concentration , these nano-rods change the shape of the liposomes from spherical , before drug loading , to prolate ( oval) , post drug loading. Cryo-TEM analysis provides a detailed size distribution of both the liposomes ( minor and major axes) and the nano-rod drug. Both these values are relevant to the drug performance. In this study , we show that at elevated drug concentration ( 2.75 mg/ml) the drug grows mainly along the major axis and that this high concentration can result , in some cases , in liposome rupture. We show that the combination of cryo-TEM and DLS constitutes a reliable tool for demonstrating the stability of the formulation in human plasma at body temperature , a characteristic that is crucial for achieving therapeutic efficacy.
