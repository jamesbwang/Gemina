  Magnetic compression anastomosis ( magnamosis , MCA) has been verified safe and effective by us and others in animal bilioenteric anastomosis ( BEA). The objective of the present study was to introduce clinical application of magnetic compression bilioenteric anastomosis ( MC-BEA) with a unique device in series of patients. Patients with obstructive jaundice with an indication of BEA were prospectively enrolled from 2012 to 2015. After dissection of bile ducts , the mother ring and drainage tube were placed in the proximal bile duct and the purse-string suture was tightened over the drainage tube. The drainage tube was introduced into the jejunal lumen at the anastomotic site and used to guide the daughter ring to assemble with the mother ring. All the patients were routinely followed up for magnets discharge or any complications associated. Forty-one patients were included. Thirty-four ( 82.9 %) patients had a malignant primary<disease> disease<disease> , while seven ( 17.1 %) had benign disease. The median time for MC-BEA was 10.5 min ( interquartile range ( IQR) 8.3-13.0 min). No perioperative morbidity or mortality associated with MC-BEA was observed. The median time for a patent bilioenteric anastomosis formation was 19.0 days ( IQR 14.5-23.0 days) , and the magnets were discharged with a median postoperative duration of 35.0 days ( IQR 28.0-43.0 days). With a median follow-up of 547.5 days ( range 223-1042 days) , no patients had biliary fistula<disease> , while two ( 4.9 %) developed anastomotic stricture at 4 months and 14 months after surgery , and underwent reoperation for reconstruction of BEA. MCA is a safe , effective , and time-saving modality for biliojejunostomy.
