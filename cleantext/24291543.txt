  Superparamagnetic nanoparticles ( SPMNPs) have attracted interest for various biomedical applications due to their unique magnetic behavior , excellent biocompatibility , easy surface modification , and low cost. Their unique magnetic properties , superparamagnetism , and magnetophoretic mobility have led to their inclusion in immunoassays to enhance biosensor sensitivity and allow for rapid detection of various analytes. In this review , we describe SPMNP characteristics valuable for incorporation into biosensors , including the use of SPMNPs to increase detection capabilities of surface plasmon resonance and giant magneto-resistive biosensors. The current status of SPMNP-based immunoassays to improve the sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests is reviewed , and suggested strategies for the successful adoption of SPMNPs for immunoassays are presented.
