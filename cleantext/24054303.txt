  In 2017 , genomic selection was implemented in French dairy goats using the single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction ( ssGBLUP) method , which assumes that all single nucleotide polymorphisms explain the same fraction of genetic variance. However , ssGBLUP is not suitable for protein content , which is controlled by a major gene , i.e. α Genomic evaluation for protein content was performed with data from the official genetic evaluation on 2955 animals genotyped with the Illumina goat SNP50 BeadChip , 7202 animals genotyped at the α Accuracies of GEBV with ssGBLUP improved by + 5 to + 7 percent points over accuracies from the pedigree-based BLUP model. With the WssGBLUP methods , SNPs that are located close to the α The three weighted ssGBLUP methods were efficient for detecting SNPs associated with protein content and for a better prediction of genomic breeding values than ssGBLUP. They also combined fast computing , simplicity and required ssGBLUP to be run only twice.
