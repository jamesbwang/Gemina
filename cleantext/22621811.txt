  Canopy exchange is one of the most important processes involved in the internal transfer of elements in forest<disease> ecosystems. However , little information is available on how canopy exchange influences the input of base cations in subalpine forests. Therefore , the concentrations and fluxes of base cations in throughfall and stemflow were investigated from August 2015 to July 2016 ( except for the frozen season) in a representative subalpine spruce plantation in the eastern Tibet Plateau. Our results showed that the mean concentrations of K , Ca , Na and Mg were higher in the stemflow than in the throughfall and precipitation. The total input fluxes of K , Ca , Na and Mg in the internal forest<disease> were lower than those in the non-forest. Moreover , the results from the canopy budget model indicated that the canopy exchange fluxes of K , Ca and Mg were higher than the dry deposition fluxes , and Ca and Mg were uptaken , whereas K was leached when precipitation passed through the canopy. Therefore , the results suggested that the input of base cations is mainly controlled by canopy exchange during precipitation in subalpine forest<disease> ecosystems , and the canopy could alter the sinks and sources of base cations from precipitation.
