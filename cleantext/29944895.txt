  Three new cembrane-type diterpenoids , deheiculatins M-O ( 1-3) , together with five known analogues ( 4-8) , were isolated from the twigs of Macaranga pustulata King ex Hook. The structures of new compounds 1-3 were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses , modified Mosher 's method , and the experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism ( ECD) experiments. All the isolates were evaluated for their cytotoxicity on three human cancer cell lines ( CNE1 , CNE2 , and HCT 116) , and all of them showed weak cytotoxicity ( IC
