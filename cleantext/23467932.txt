  Toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR9 are both implicated in the activation of autoreactive B cells and other cell types associated with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE) pathogenesis. However , Tlr9-/- autoimmune-prone strains paradoxically develop more severe disease. We have now leveraged the negative regulatory role of TLR9 to develop an inducible rapid-onset murine model of systemic autoimmunity that depends on T cell detection of a membrane-bound OVA fusion protein expressed by MHC class II + cells , expression of TLR7 , expression of the type I IFN receptor , and loss of expression of TLR9. These mice are distinguished by a high frequency of OVA-specific Tbet + , IFN-Î³ + , and FasL-expressing Th1 cells as well as autoantibody-producing B cells. Unexpectedly , contrary to what occurs in most models of SLE , they also developed skin<symptom> lesions<symptom> that are very similar to those of human cutaneous lupus erythematosus ( CLE) as far as clinical appearance , histological changes , and gene expression. FasL was a key effector mechanism in the skin , as the transfer of FasL-deficient DO11gld T cells completely failed to elicit overt skin<symptom> lesions<symptom>. FasL was also upregulated in human CLE biopsies. Overall , our model provides a relevant system for exploring the pathophysiology of CLE as well as the negative regulatory role of TLR9.
