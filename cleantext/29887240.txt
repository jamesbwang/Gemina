  Prostate cancer ( PCa) has long been thought of as a disease with a heterogeneous phenotype. It can manifest in men as benign growths that can be safely watched or as more aggressive malignancies that can prove fatal. Recent investigations at the genomic , histopathological and molecular levels have identified tumor heterogeneity , the phenomenon of individual tumor cells presenting distinct genomic and phenotypic characteristics , as one of the most confounding and complex factors underlying PCa diagnosis , prognosis , and treatment. Despite tremendous progress made over the course of the last decade we still have an incomplete understanding of the extent and effect of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity in the course of PCa progression. For example , a primary tumor can be classified into one of several molecular subgroups depending on whether the cancer has a particular gene fusion or a mutation which in turn might yield some patient-specific therapeutic regimen , but this same type of heterogeneous growth can be spatially or temporally restricted proving it difficult to detect during biopsy. We therefore present here a comprehensive review of the various studies addressing intra-tumor heterogeneity in PCa and in the context of that seen in other solid tumors. We discuss the impact of heterogeneity on clinical decision-making in treating both primary and metastatic lesions<symptom> and how our understanding of this heterogeneity might help in developing better diagnostic tools and biomarkers and in guiding the selection of better therapeutic strategies.
