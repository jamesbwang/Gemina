  The weakly associated micellar aggregates found in the so-called `` pre-ouzo region '' of the surfactant-free microemulsion water/ethanol/1-octanol are sensitive to changes in the system composition and also to the presence of additives like salt. In this work , we study the influence of two salts , sodium iodide and lithium chloride , on aggregates in water/ethanol/1-octanol by molecular dynamics simulations. In both cases , ethanol concentration in the nonpolar phase and at the interface is increased due to a salting out effect on ethanol in the aqueous pseudo-phase. In addition , minor charging of the interface as a consequence of differential adsorption of anions and cations occurs. However , this charge separation is overall weakened by the erratic surface of octanol aggregates , where polar hydroxyl groups and hydrophobic patches are both present. Furthermore , ethanol at the interface shields hydrophobic patches and reduces the preferential adsorption of iodide and lithium.
