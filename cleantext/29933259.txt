  The aim of this study was to determine whether auditory streaming ( segregation of incoming sounds<symptom> into separate sound sources) and the ability to anticipate future auditory events are affected in tinnitus<symptom> sufferers compared with nontinnitus controls with matched levels of hearing. It was hypothesized that tinnitus<symptom> would result in abnormal electroencephalography responses to tone deviants and tone omissions compared to controls for frequencies near the pitch of tinnitus<symptom> , and this should correspond with increased levels of cortical γ and θ oscillatory rhythms. Sixteen individuals with tinnitus<symptom> ( 10 men and 6 women; age , 53.44; SD , 12.92 years) and 14 control participants ( 8 men and 6 women; age , 50.25; SD , 18.54 years) took part in the study. A modified version of the ABA streaming paradigm , with repeating triplet pattern of two frequencies ( A and B) presented as A-B-A , was used to examine deviant-related prediction error. Omission-related prediction errors were examined using a modified version of a tone-omission paradigm. Regions of interest were frontocentral , left frontal , right frontal , and temporal lobes. A larger N1c waveform was elicited in the absence of any tone<symptom> deviation<symptom> within the left primary auditory cortex of tinnitus<symptom> participants. No differences were present between groups for omissions. The only difference in oscillatory band activity between the two groups in this study was in response to tones<symptom> 7 semitones different from tinnitus<symptom> pitch , with significantly lower β-2 band activity present for the tinnitus<symptom> group , correlating most with activity within the right inferior occipital gyrus. The findings from this study imply that cortical-level auditory stream segregation is altered among individuals with
