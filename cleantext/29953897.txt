  We examined the use of automated voice recognition ( AVR) messages targeting smokers from primary care practices located in underserved urban and rural communities to promote smoking cessation. We partnered with urban and rural primary care medical offices ( n = 7) interested in offering this service to patients. Current smokers , 18 years and older , who had completed an office visit within the previous 12 months , from these sites were used to create a smoker 's registry. Smokers were recruited within an eight county region of western New<pathogen> York State between June 2012 and August 2013. Participants were contacted over six month intervals using the AVR system. Among 5812 smokers accrued 1899 ( 32 %) were reached through the AVR system and 55 % ( n = 1049) continued to receive calls. Smokers with race other than white or African American were less likely to be reached ( OR = 0.71 , 0.57-0.90) , while smokers ages 40 and over were more likely to be reached. Females ( OR = 0.78 , 0.65-0.95) and persons over age 40 years were less likely to opt out , while rural smokers were more likely to opt out ( OR = 3.84 , 3.01-4.90). Among those receiving AVR calls , 30 % reported smoke free ( self-reported abstinence over a 24 h period) at last contact; smokers from rural areas were more likely to report being smoke free ( OR = 1.41 , 1.01-1.97). An AVR-based smoking cessation intervention provided added value beyond typical tobacco cessation efforts available in these primary care offices. This intervention required no additional clinical staff time and served to satisfy a component of patient center medical home requirements for practices.
