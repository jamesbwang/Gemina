  Biliary atresia ( BA) is difficult to distinguish from other causes of cholestasis. We evaluated the use of liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy ( LC-MS) and bile acid profiles in the rapid , noninvasive diagnosis of BA. Following Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Institutional Review Board approval , we used LC-MS to measure 26 bile acids in serum and stool<symptom> samples from experimental models of BA and in urine , stool<symptom> , and serum samples from non-cholestatic and cholestatic human infants. We first evaluated the utility of LC-MS to distinguish bile acid profiles between sham , bile duct ligation , and 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine mouse models of BA. Serum bile acids were significantly higher and stool<symptom> bile acids were significantly lower in experimental BA. Next , we evaluated samples from non-cholestatic , cholestatic non-BA , and BA infants. There was no significant difference between cholestatic non-BA and BA stool<symptom> and urine samples. However , primary bile acids were significantly higher in BA versus cholestatic non-BA samples ( 128.1 ± 14.2 versus 61.2 ± 20.5 μM). In addition , the primary , conjugated bile acids glycochenodeoxycholic acid and taurochenodeoxycholic acid were significantly elevated in BA compared with cholestatic non-BA serum samples. Using a receiver operating characteristic curve , we found that a serum glycochenodeoxycholic acid concentration of 30 μM had a sensitivity of 100 % , specificity of 83.3 % , positive predictive value of 88.9 % , and negative predictive value of 100 % in the diagnosis of BA. Our data indicate that bile acid patterns can be used to distinguish experimental and human BA from non-cholestatic and , more importantly , cholestatic disease. This suggests that LC-MS may be useful in the accurate , rapid , and non-invasive diagnosis of BA.
