  Development of next-generation sequencing and metagenomics has revolutionized detection of novel viruses. Among these viruses are 3 human protoparvoviruses: bufavirus , tusavirus , and cutavirus. These viruses have been detected in feces of children with diarrhea<disease> In addition , cutavirus has been detected in skin biopsy specimens of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patients in France and in 1 melanoma patient in Denmark. We studied seroprevalences of IgG against bufavirus , tusavirus , and cutavirus in various populations ( n = 840) , and found a striking geographic difference in prevalence of bufavirus IgG. Although prevalence was low in adult populations in Finland ( 1.9 %) and the United States ( 3.6 %) , bufavirus IgG was highly prevalent in populations in Iraq ( 84.8 %) , Iran ( 56.1 %) , and Kenya ( 72.3 %). Conversely , cutavirus IgG showed evenly low prevalences ( 0 % -5.6 %) in all cohorts , and tusavirus IgG was not detected. These results provide new insights on the global distribution and endemic areas of protoparvoviruses.
