  Vulval lichen sclerosus ( VLS) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting the anogenital area in women. Serious long-term consequences of VLS include the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva as well as of scarring and alteration of vulval architecture. The treatment of choice for genital lichen sclerosus in females is potent to very potent topical corticosteroids. There are few published data on the course of VLS in pregnancy. We present our experience of managing 33 pregnancies in 29 women with VLS.
