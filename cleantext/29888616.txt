  An estimated 28,000 French people infected with HIV<pathogen> remain undiagnosed , leading to HIV<pathogen> transmission and late-stage HIV<pathogen> infections. An over-the-counter HIV<pathogen> self-test has been available since September 2015. We thus aimed to explore people 's perceptions of and intentions to use the test. An anonymous online questionnaire , targeting the general population and men who have sex with men ( MSM) was distributed between November 2015 and January 2016. It explored at-risk sexual behavior , perceptions of the HIV<pathogen> self-test , and past and intended future use. A total of 1,082 participants completed ≥ 90 % of the questionnaire ( 67.1 % male , 32.4 % female , 0.5 % other; mean age 32.8 ± 12 years). 44.8 % were MSM. 41.5 % declared that they did not always use or make their partner use a condom in the case of penetration with someone other than their usual partner ( if applicable). 9.9 % had already used the HIV<pathogen> self-test , with this proportion being higher in multivariate analysis for individuals with a monthly income exceeding $ 1,000 and those declaring to be informed about HIV<pathogen>. 38.5 % stated their intention to use the self-test in the coming month or year; in multivariate analysis , this proportion was lower for MSM and higher for those who did not always use or make their partner use a condom in the case of penetration with someone other than their usual partner. The majority ( 68.4 %) underestimated the testing delay to rule out HIV<pathogen> infection. The most frequently cited concerns were that self-test does not test for other sexually transmitted infections ( 49.5 %) and is not free of charge ( 44.4 %) , and that users are left alone with the result ( 41.0 %). The HIV<pathogen> self-test was identified as a useful tool by different at-risk populations; it may therefore enhance the number of diagnoses. The test delay must be appropriately communicated to users , while a lower purchase price may increase usage.
