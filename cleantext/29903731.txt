  Ceramides are sphingolipids involved with cellular signaling. Synthesis of ceramides occurs in all tissues. Ceramides accumulate within tissues and the blood plasma during metabolic dysfunction , dyslipidemia , and inflammation<symptom>. Elevations of ceramides are predictive of cardiovascular mortality. We sought to verify the utility of plasma concentrations of 4 ceramides: N-palmitoyl-sphingosine ( Cer ( 16:0)) , N-stearoyl-sphingosine ( Cer ( 18:0)) , N-nervonoyl-sphingosine ( Cer ( 24:1)) , and N-lignoceroyl-sphingosine ( Cer ( 24:0)) in predicting major adverse cardiovascular events in a diverse patient population referred for coronary angiography. Plasma ceramides were measured in 495 participants before nonurgent coronary angiography. Coronary artery disease , defined as > 50 % stenosis in â‰¥ 1 coronary artery , was identified 265 ( 54 %) cases. Ceramides were not significantly associated with coronary artery disease. Patients were followed for a combined primary end point of myocardial infarction , percutaneous intervention , coronary artery bypass , stroke , or death within 4 years. Ceramides were significantly predictive of outcomes after adjusting for age , sex , body mass index , hypertension , smoking , LDL ( low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol , HDL ( high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol , triglycerides , serum glucose , and family history of coronary artery disease. The fully adjusted per SD hazard ratios ( 95 % confidence interval) were 1.50 ( 1.16-1.93) for Cer ( 16:0) , 1.42 ( 1.11-1.83) for Cer ( 18:0) , 1.43 ( 1.08-1.89) for Cer ( 24:1) , and 1.58 ( 1.22-2.04) for the ceramide risk score. Elevated plasma concentrations of ceramides are independently associated with major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with and without coronary artery disease.
