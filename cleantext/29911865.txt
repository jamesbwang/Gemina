  This work is aimed at developing an electrochemical sensor for the sensitive and selective detection of trace levels of perfluorooctanesulfonate ( PFOS) in water. Contamination of waters by perfluorinated alkyl substances ( PFAS) is a problem of global concern due to their suspected toxicity and ability to bioaccumulate. PFOS is the perfluorinated compound of major concern , as it has the lowest suggested control concentrations. The sensor reported here is based on a gold electrode modified with a thin coating of a molecularly imprinted polymer ( MIP) , prepared by anodic electropolymerization of o-phenylenediamine ( o-PD) in the presence of PFOS as the template. Activation of the sensor is achieved by template removal with suitable a solvent mixture. Voltammetry , a quartz crystal microbalance , scanning electron microscopy and elemental analysis were used to monitor the electropolymerization process , template removal , and binding of the analyte. Ferrocenecarboxylic acid ( FcCOOH) has been exploited as an electrochemical probe able to generate analytically useful voltammetric signals by competing for the binding sites with PFOS , as the latter is not electroactive. The sensor has a low detection limit ( 0.04 nM) , a satisfactory selectivity , and is reproducible and repeatable , giving analytical results in good agreement with those obtained by HPLC-MS/MS analyses.
