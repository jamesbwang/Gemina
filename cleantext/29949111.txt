  Ruminative thinking is related to an increased risk for major depressive disorder ( MDD) and perpetuates negative mood states. Rumination , uncontrollable negative thoughts about the self , may comprise both reflective and brooding components. However , only brooding rumination is consistently associated with increased negativity bias and negative coping styles , while reflective rumination has a less clear relationship with negative outcomes in healthy and depressed participants. The current study examined seed-to-voxel ( S2.V) resting-state functional connectivity ( FC) in a sample of healthy ( HC) and depressed ( MDD) adult women ( HC: n = 50 , MDD: n = 33). The S2V FC of six key brain regions , including the left and right amygdala , anterior and posterior cingulate cortex ( ACC , PCC) , and medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices ( mPFC , dlPFC) , was correlated with self-reported reflective and brooding rumination. Results indicate that HC and MDD participants had increased brooding rumination associated with decreased FC between the left amygdala and the right temporal pole. Moreover , reflective rumination was associated with distinct FC of the mPFC , PCC , and ACC with parietal , occipital , and cingulate regions. Depressed participants , compared with HC , exhibited decreased FC between the PCC and a region in the right middle frontal gyrus. The results of the current study add to the understanding of the neural underpinnings of different forms of self-related cognition-brooding and reflective rumination-in healthy and depressed women.
