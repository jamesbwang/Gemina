  We present the case of a 61-year-old patient with a history of essential thrombocythemia ( ET) who was diagnosed as having aortic valve stenosis and dilatation of his ascending aorta. His aortic valve and ascending aorta were replaced under hypothermic circulatory arrest ( HCA). No clear guideline exists for preoperative , perioperative , and postoperative management of cardiac surgery using HCA for ET patients. After performing risk assessment , we prescribed preoperative aspirin therapy and postoperative care was planned as usual for cardiovascular surgery in our establishment. Unexpectedly , activated clotting time did not exceed 400 seconds , but the course of treatment was otherwise uneventful.
