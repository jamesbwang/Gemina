  Core biopsy is today recognized as the gold standard for the diagnosis of bone lesions<symptom>; unfortunately , when the bone is too solid it can be very difficult to penetrate it; in case of failure , open biopsy is indicated but it is associated with greater contamination and complications. A possible solution is to connect a common orthopedic drill to the core biopsy needle. The aim of the presenting study was to present a technique useful for performing biopsies in case of very strong bone lesions<symptom> and to evaluate the adequacy and quality of the obtained specimen. A standard bone biopsy set was connected to a commercial drill to perform bone biopsies. Data was collected over a 2-year period ( 2015-2016). Information regarding technical success , diagnostic data and complication rates was all collated to assess the technical feasibility of this technique. Out of 357 bone biopsies , 34 patients underwent the procedure using a common orthopedic drill connected to a core biopsy needle. Diagnostic material was obtained in each patient and the artifacts were considered irrelevant. No major complications occurred in any patient. The use of a core biopsy needle connected to a common orthopedic drill facilitates the penetration of thick cortical bone by simply applying continuous speed and pressure; nevertheless , the biopsy needle we use is not designed for a drilling procedure and for this reason it can be damaged , but if the biopsy is performed with particular attention , the mechanical failure can be avoided CONCLUSIONS: Bone biopsy using a commercial hand drill has a technically high success rate with minimal complications. Further studies with more cases are necessary to verify our results.
