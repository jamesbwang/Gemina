  Cholinesterase activity ( ChA) , the effective biomarker for organophosphate pesticide exposure , is possibly affected by single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) in cell-cycle-related genes. One hundred and eighty workers with long-term exposure to omethoate and 115 healthy controls were recruited to explore the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. The acetylthiocholine and dithio-bis- ( nitrobenzoic acid) method was used to detect the cholinesterase activities in whole blood , erythrocytes and plasma. Genetic polymorphisms were determined by the PCR-RFLP and direct PCR electrophoresis methods. Statistical results showed that the cholinesterase activities of whole blood , erythrocytes and plasma in the exposure group were significantly lower than those in the control group (
