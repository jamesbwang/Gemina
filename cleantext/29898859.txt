  Bilateral vocal folds ' immobility is a challenge in laryngology. Multiple procedures have been proposed to improve breathing by statically enlarging the glottal airway , what also results in loss of voice and aspiration. We proposed a technique to enlarge the posterior glottis by rotating the arytenoids on its axis , imitating the function of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle , with the objective of evaluating the results regarding decannulation , voice quality , and bronchoaspiration. This study is a clinical case series of patients with bilateral vocal fold paralysis who underwent an arytenoid rotation surgery at a single tertiary university care institution between 2011 and 2017. Data were prospectively collected and was complemented with information from medical charts. Patients were assessed for decannulation , dyspnea<symptom> , posterior glottic opening , quality of voice , and swallowing disorders. Nine patients were included in the study. Out of three patients who required tracheostomy , two were successfully decannulated. Six patients reported a significant improvement in their dyspnea<symptom> , while four patients reported a worsening of their voice. The stroboscopy evidenced a posterior glottic opening of at least 7 mm in six patients. Eight patients had no aspiratory symptoms , and the acoustic analysis showed that only one patient has a normal voice. The arytenoid rotation on its axis by imitating the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle preserves the physiological functions of the larynx , which allows sufficient opening of the posterior glottis for breathing , and could alter in a lesser extent the anterior glottis to maintain a good quality of voice and swallowing.
