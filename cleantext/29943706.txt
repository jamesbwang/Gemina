  Septins have been identified to play important roles in platelets , but their regulation in platelets is unknown. Human platelet being an enucleated and terminally differentiated cell , mRNA downregulation by miRs is one of the posttranscriptional mechanisms operative in platelets. Since platelets are known to have miR-223 in abundance , the objective of this study is to test whether a) platelet septins have miR-223 interacting target sites in their mRNA 3 ` UTRs , b) septin mRNAs and miR-223 form complexes with Argonaute 2 ( AGO2) protein in platelets , which is the catalytic component of an RNA Induced Silencing Complex ( RISC) , c) a reporter gene with septin mRNA 3 ' untranslated region ( UTR) is subjected to downregulation by miR-223 and d) anti-miR-223 can suppress miR-223 activity and enhance septin-2 expression in platelets. Bioinformatics tools were used to screen mRNA 3 ` UTRs of septin-2 and septin-6 for miR-223 target sites. Subsequently , platelet extracts were immunoprecipitated by AGO2 antibodies to identify that the two septin mRNAs and miR-223 were in complex with AGO2. A luciferase reporter chimeric-gene expression system was utilized to monitor miR-223 mediated downregulation luciferase gene containing the 3 ` UTR of either septin-2 or septin-6. Further , anti-miR-223 was utilized in platelets to directly demonstrate the role of miR-223 on the expression of septin-2. Our results demonstrate that in stored platelets a) septine-2 and septin-6 mRNAs have miR-223 target sites , b) septin-2 and septin-6 are in complex with Ago-2 , c) in luciferase reporter gene system , the interaction of miR-223 with 3 ' UTRs of septin-2 and septin-6 leads to downregulation of luciferase expression and d) anti-miR-223 downregulated miR-223 activity and thereby the expression of septin-2 is upregulated. The results demonstrate that like in nucleated cells , enucleated platelets also have miR-based mechanisms for the regulation of for their septins.
