  γδ T cell-based immunotherapy for osteosarcoma ( OS) has shown limited success thus far. DNA-demethylating agents not only induce tumor cell death but also have an immunomodulatory function. In this study , we have assessed the potential benefit of combining decitabine ( DAC , a DNA demethylation drug) and γδ T cells for OS immunotherapy. DAC increased the expression of natural killer group 2D ( NKG2D) ligands ( NKG2DLs) , including major histocompatibility complex class I-related chains B ( MICB) and UL16-binding protein 1 ( ULBP1) , on the OS cell surface , making the cells more sensitive to recognition and destruction by cytotoxic γδ T cells. The upregulation of MICB and ULBP1 was due to promoter DNA demethylation. Importantly , the killing of OS cells by γδ T cells was partially reversed by blocking the NKG2D receptor , suggesting that the γδ T cell-mediated cytolysis of DAC-pretreated OS cells was mainly dependent on the NKG2D-NKG2DL axis.
