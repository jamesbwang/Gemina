  In this study , whether ischemia modified albumin ( IMA) has a role in showing severity or criticality of coronary arteries in patients with unstable angina pectoris ( USAP)/ non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI) was assessed. A total of 65 patients ( 40 male ( M) and 25 female ( F) patients; mean age 59.7 Â± 12.1 years) with the initial diagnosis of USAP/NSTEMI were included in this study. The levels of IMA , troponin T , creatine kinase MB ( CK-MB) , C-reactive protein ( CRP) , brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP) , creatinine , lipid panel , and whole blood count were measured from venous blood obtained from each patient within 3 h after the onset of symptoms. A 50 % or greater coronary lumen stenosis of any coronary vessel or lateral branch was considered as critical stenosis. The severity of coronary artery disease ( CAD) was assessed using the Gensini scoring system. IMA was significantly higher in patients with critical coronary artery stenosis ( median , 206 vs. 23; P < 0.001). There was a weak correlation between the Gensini score and IMA; whereas there was a moderate correlation between the Gensini score and BNP levels ( r = 0.44 , P = 0.02). The level of IMA can predict the criticality of CAD; however , it can not predict the severity of CAD according to Gensini score in patients with USAP/NSTEMI.
