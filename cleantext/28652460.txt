  Fall injuries are common among the elderly. The aim of this study was to investigate whether blood-pressure patterns , as measured by 24-h ambulatory blood<symptom> pressure<symptom> monitoring ( ABPM) , or intensification of antihypertensive therapy following the 24-h ABPM , may be associated with fall injuries in hypertensive elderly patients. In a retrospective study , community-based elderly patients ( age ≥ 70 years) who were referred to 24-h ABPM were evaluated for fall injuries within one-year post-ABPM. We compared the clinical characteristics , 24-h ABPM patterns and the intensification of hypertensive therapy following 24-h ABPM , between patients with and without a fall injury. Overall 1032 hypertensive elderly patients were evaluated. Fifty-five ( 5.3 %) had a fall injury episode in the year following ABPM. Patients with a fall injury were significantly older , and with higher rates of previous falls. Lower 24-h diastolic blood-pressure ( 67.3 ± 7.6 Low diastolic blood-pressure and increased pulse-pressure in 24-h ABPM were associated with an increased risk of fall injury in elderly hypertensive patients. Intensification of antihypertensive treatment following 24-h ABPM was not associated with an increased risk of fall injury.
