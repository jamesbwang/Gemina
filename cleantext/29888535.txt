  In tomato , auxin and gibberellins ( GAs) interact with each other to drive fruit growth and development. While the role of auxin in directing GA biosynthesis and signal is already known , very little information has been obtained about GA-mediated control of auxin signalling and response. Interestingly , we show that gibberellic acid ( GA
