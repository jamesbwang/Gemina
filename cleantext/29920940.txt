  The rational design and development of efficient and affordable enzyme-free electrocatalysts for electrochemical detection are of great significance for the large-scale applications of sensor materials , and have aroused increasing research interest. Herein , we report that a typical polyoxometalate ( POM)- based metal-organic framework ( NENU5) that was hybridized with ketjenblack ( KB) was a highly efficient electrochemical catalyst that could be used for the highly sensitive nonenzymatic detection of H
