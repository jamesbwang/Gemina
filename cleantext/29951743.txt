  Bacterioplankton are both primary producers and primary consumers in aquatic ecosystems , which were commonly investigated to reflect environmental changes , evaluate primary productivity , and assess biogeochemical cycles. However , there is relatively less understanding of their responses to anthropogenic disturbances such as constructions of dams/tunnels/roads that may significantly affect the aquatic ecosystem. To fill such gap , this study focused on the bacterioplankton communities ' diversity and turnover during a tunnel construction across an urban lake ( Lake Donghu , Wuhan , China) , and five batches of samples were collected within 2 months according to the tunnel construction progress. Results indicated that both resources and predator factors contributed significant to the variations of bacterioplankton communities , but the closed area and open areas showed different diversity patterns due to the impacts of tunnel construction. Briefly , the phytoplankton , TN , and TP in water were still significantly correlated with the bacterioplankton composition and diversity like that in normal conditions. Additionally , the organic matter , TN , and NH
