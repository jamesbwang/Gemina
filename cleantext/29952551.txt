  By using a carbon-coated anodic aluminum oxide ( CAAO) film as a monolithic porous electrode for the immobilization of Trametes laccases ( LACs) , an attempt is made to control the orientation of LAC molecules toward the electrode surface simply by applying an electric potential to the CAAO film. Because the resulting film is characterized by a myriad of open , simple , and straight nanochannels with diameters as large as 40 nm , the O
