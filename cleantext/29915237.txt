  Over the last decade , research on distinct types of CRISPR systems has revealed many structural and functional variations. Recently , several novel types of single-polypeptide CRISPR-associated systems have been discovered including Cas12a/Cpf1 and Cas13a/C2c2. Despite distant similarities to Cas9 , these additional systems have unique structural and functional features , providing new opportunities for genome editing applications. Here , relevant fundamental features of natural and engineered CRISPR-Cas variants are compared. Moreover , practical matters are discussed that are essential for dedicated genome editing applications , including nuclease regulation and delivery , target specificity , as well as host repair diversity.
