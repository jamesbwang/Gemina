  The genus Panax consists of a group of prized medicinal herbs. Major members of the Panax genus include P. ginseng , P. notoginseng , P. quinquefolius , and P. vietnamensis. They possess various bioactive constituents such as ginsenosides , saponins , polysaccharides and proteins. Many of them were reported to show beneficial effects on human health. Ginsenosides and saponins of ginsengs caught the sight of most researchers. Precise investigations revealed their roles on improvement of the functioning of the nervous system , cardiovascular system , and other functions. In contrast , our knowledge of the bioactive Panax proteins is relatively limited. A number of proteins from P. ginseng , the most valuable member of Panax species , have been investigated and proved to be beneficial to our body. Meanwhile , a few bioactive P. notoginseng proteins , such as ribonucleases and antifungal proteins , have been characterized and reported. We summarize herein the proteins present in P. notoginseng that have been identified , and try to compare them with those from other Panax species with a similar structure or bioactivity , and conclude whether the proteins in P. notoginseng have any distinctive features.
