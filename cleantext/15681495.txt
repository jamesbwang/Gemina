  The level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25- ( OH) D associated with inflammatory factors in children during an asthma attack was investigated. In total , 60 child patients , who were admitted and treated in the Affiliated Children 's Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University from March 2015 to March 2017 , during their asthma attacks , were selected as the observation group. The patients were divided into the high 25- ( OH) D ( n = 28) and low 25- ( OH) D ( n = 32) groups according to the median level of 25- ( OH) D A total of 30 healthy children were selected as the control group. Biochemical indexes , humoral immunity , the level of tumor necrosis<symptom> factor-α ( TNF-α) and interleukin-6 ( IL-6) contents as well as pulmonary function indexes were examined. The correlations in the levels of 25- ( OH) D , IL-6 and TNF-α were also analysed. The results showed that the quantities of leukocytes , neutrophils and eosinophils of patients in the observation group were significantly increased compared with those in the control group ( P < 0.05). The contents of IL-6 and TNF-α in the observation group were obviously higher than those in the normal control group ( P < 0.05). The contents of serum IL-6 and TNF-α in the high 25- ( OH) D group were lower than those in the low 25- ( OH) D group 3 days after treatment ( P < 0.05). Moreover , the treatment effect in the high 25- ( OH) D group was better than that in the low 25- ( OH) D group ( P < 0.05). In addition , 25- ( OH) D had a positive correlation with pulmonary function indexes ( P < 0.05) , while TNF-α and IL-6 were negatively associated with pulmonary function indexes ( P < 0.05). The serum 25- ( OH) D level in asthmatic children was negatively associated with the levels of inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-6. The results showed that the level of 25- ( OH) D was decreased in children with asthma attack , which is associated with the inflammatory mediators , IL-6 and TNF-α , as well as pulmonary functions ( P < 0.05). Therefore , the level of 25- ( OH) D can be used as a test indicator for the prevention and control of childhood asthma.
