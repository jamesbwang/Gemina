  Worldwide , colorectal cancer ( CRC) is a deleterious disease causing millions of death annually. 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU) is a first-line chemotherapy for CRC , but chemoresistance and gastrointestinal mucositis limit its efficacy. Polyphenol-rich foods are increasingly popular due to their potential beneficial roles in preventing and treating cancer. Ellagitannins are a group of phenolic compounds commonly found in pomegranate , strawberries , raspberries , etc.. The objective of this study was to explore whether ellagitannins from pomegranate ( PETs) could ameliorate 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis and enhance the drug 's efficacy against CRC. The results showed that PETs ( 100 mg/kg) counteracted 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis in rats. The number of apoptotic cells per crypt was reduced from 1.50 ± 0.21 to 0.85 ± 0.18 ( P < 0.05). Moreover , PETs induced HT-29 CRC cell death through intrinsic apoptosis , as demonstrated by dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential , increased Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio , and cleavage of caspase 9 and caspase 3. PETs and 5-FU combination treatments exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity against HT-29 cells with a weighted combination index of 0.3494. PETs ( 80 μg/mL) and 5-FU ( 40 μg/mL) treatments for 48 h induced 14.03 ± 0.76 % and 16.42 ± 1.15 % of HT-29 cells to undergo apoptosis , while the combination treatment further increased apoptosis of cells to 34.00 ± 1.54 % ( P < 0.05). Combination treatment of the cells also enhanced S phase cell cycle arrest as compared with PETs or 5-FU monotherapy ( P < 0.05). These results suggest that dietary ellagitannins from pomegranate could alleviate intestinal mucositis in rats induced by 5-FU while enhancing its toxicity against HT-29 cells through potentiation of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
