  The inhibitory checkpoint molecule programmed death ( PD) -1 plays a vital role in maintaining immune homeostasis upon binding to its ligands , PD-L1 and PD-L2. Several recent studies have demonstrated that soluble PD-1 ( sPD-1) can block the interaction between membrane PD-1 and PD-L1 to enhance the anti-tumor capability of T cells. However , the affinity of natural sPD-1 binding to PD-L1 is too low to permit therapeutic applications. Here a PD-1 variant with ~ 3,000-fold and ~ 70-fold affinity increase to bind PD-L1 and PD-L2 , respectively , was generated through directed molecular evolution and phage display technology. Structural analysis showed that mutations at amino acid positions 124 and 132 of PD-1 played major roles in enhancing the affinity of PD-1 binding to its ligands. The high-affinity PD-1 mutant could compete with the binding of antibodies specific to PD-L1 or PD-L2 on cancer cells or dendritic cells ( DCs) , and it could enhance the proliferation and IFN-Î³ release of activated lymphocytes. These features potentially qualify the high-affinity PD-1 variant as a unique candidate for the development of a new class of PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapeutics.
