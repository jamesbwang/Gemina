  Geraniol is a widely used fragrance terpene , and is included in fragrance mix I. Geraniol is prone to autoxidation , forming the skin sensitizers geranial , neral , and geraniol-7-hydroperoxide. Oxidized geraniol has previously been patch tested in 1 clinic , giving 1 % to 4.6 % positive reactions in consecutive patients when tested at 2 % to 11 %. To compare test reactions to pure and oxidized geraniol , to compare 2 different test concentrations of oxidized geraniol and to investigate the pattern of concomitant reactions to fragrance markers of the baseline series in a multicentre setting. One thousand four hundred and seventy-six consecutive patients referred for patch testing were patch tested with geraniol 6 % pet. and oxidized geraniol 6 % and 11 % pet. Pure geraniol 6 % pet. , oxidized geraniol 6 % pet. and oxidized geraniol 11 % pet. gave 1 % , 3 % and 8 % positive patch test reactions and 0.7 % , 3 % and 5 % doubtful reactions , respectively. Approximately 50 % of the patients with doubtful reactions to oxidized geraniol 6 % pet. had positive reactions to oxidized geraniol 11 % pet. Oxidized geraniol 11 % pet. provides better detection than oxidized geraniol 6 % pet. As most patients reacted only to oxidized geraniol , it is important to explore further whether oxidized geraniol should be included in a baseline patch test series.
