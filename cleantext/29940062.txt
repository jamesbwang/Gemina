  Secondary central nervous system ( CNS) relapse in aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL) is a dismal diagnosis with poor outcomes. While prophylaxis against secondary CNS disease is recommended in patients with highly aggressive NHLs , such as Burkitt lymphoma , patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL) present a challenging clinical dilemma due to an inherently lower risk of CNS relapse. Current guidelines suggest that prophylaxis may benefit DLBCL patients at high risk for CNS relapse; however , it has been difficult to define which patients are truly at high risk. Many studies have attempted to clarify the issue , with conflicting results. Here we review current prognostic models , risk factors , and prophylaxis methods to provide a practical approach to preventing CNS relapse in patients with DLBCL.
