  Public health plays an important role in ensuring access to interventions that can prevent disease , including the implementation of evidence-based genomic recommendations. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) Science Impact Framework to trace the impact of public health activities and partnerships on the implementation of the 2009 Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention ( EGAPP) Lynch Syndrome<disease> screening recommendation and the 2005 and 2013 United States Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF) BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing recommendations.The EGAPP and USPSTF recommendations have each been cited by > 300 peer-reviewed publications. CDC funds selected states to build capacity to integrate these recommendations into public health programs , through education , policy , surveillance , and partnerships. Most state cancer control plans include genomics-related goals , objectives , or strategies. Since the EGAPP recommendation , major public and private payers now provide coverage for Lynch Syndrome<disease> screening for all newly diagnosed colorectal cancers. National guidelines and initiatives , including Healthy People 2020 , included similar recommendations and cited the EGAPP and USPSTF recommendations. However , disparities in implementation based on race , ethnicity , and rural residence remain challenges. Public health achievements in promoting the evidence-based use of genomics for the prevention of hereditary cancers can inform future applications of genomics in public health.
